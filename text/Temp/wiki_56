American Pie (Groove Holmes album)

American Pie is an album by American jazz organist Groove Holmes recorded in 1972 and released on the Groove Merchant label.
Reception.
Allmusic's Jason Ankeny said: "The soulful "American Pie" pairs Groove Holmes with electric pianist Larry Willis, suggesting a more nuanced and restrained interpretation of the organ/electric piano formula that energizes Holmes' Blue Note classic "Comin' on Home" ... Holmes and Willis weave a mellow, stoned-soul groove that twists and turns with lazy precision – although the material derives from sources spanning from Don McLean to Anthony Newley to Holmes himself ... the mood and tenor of the set never wavers, but the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts".

Historic centre of Nizhny Novgorod

The historic centre of Nizhny Novgorod (also old Nizhny Novgorod, the old town) is the downtown of Nizhny Novgorod with historical buildings in the borders up to 1917. A large number of ancient buildings, natural landmarks and historic districts are found in the area. In the old city there are buildings of different epochs and architectural styles, including Neo-Byzantine, Stroganov's Baroque, Empire, Modern. These include the medieval Kremlin, 19th-century mansions and Stalinist monumental houses.
Sites.
The site contains the following objects
Location.
The old city is located on two hills: Kremlevsky and Ilyinsky. On the Kremlevsky hill is the Kremlin itself and the historical districts around it: the Upper and Lower Posads, the Rozhdestvenskaya Side, a complex of historical streets (for example: Bolshaya Pokrovskaya and the Varvarskaya), the Pechersky Monastery, and Pochayna River. On the Ilyinsky hill there is the territory of Zapochainye, starting from Ilinskaya street and ending with the Lyadov Square.
The old Kanavino with the Fairground and the old Sormovo are considered part of the old town, despite the fact that these settlements were included in the city after 1917. The old Kanavino includes the territory of the Fair, the Spit and the Gordeevka. There are many landmarks in this territory: the Fair and the Main Fair Building, the Moskovsky railway station with the adjacent square and the Central Department Store, the Smolensk-Vladimir Church in Gordeevka and the Gordeevsky department store, as well as many 19th-century mansions. On the eve of the World Cup in 2018, the territory of the old Kanavino underwent major reconstruction.
Old Sormovo is more remote from the historical centre. In the centre of this territory, Stalinist style buildings predominate but there are a few pre-revolutionary buildings: the Transfiguration Cathedral, Barricade School, Krasnoye Sormovo Factory and some 19th-century mansions. At the beginning of the 20th century, Sormovo was the centre of revolutionary battles in 1905, because of this, many revolutionary monuments are located on this territory.

Waldlerhaus

The Waldlerhaus is a local form of agricultural building, typical of the Bavarian Forest and Upper Palatine Forest in Germany. The term "Waldlerhaus" goes back to the 19th century and describes the house of a person who lives in and from the forest.
Its distribution area is bounded by the edges of the Bavarian and Upper Palatine Forests. The boundary of the associated cultural-historical region has been complicated by recent history. Until the Second World War the area of the lower Bavarian Forest, the Mühlviertel in Austria and the southern Bohemian Forest in present-day Czech Republic, formed one large unit. This means there is also a difficulty in determining its boundary with the Bohemian Forest house ("Böhmerwaldhaus"), which occurs in the Czech Republic and in the "Šumava", the Czech part of the Bohemian Forest.
Description.
The Waldlerhaus is, as a rule, a single-ridge house ("Einfirsthaus") with a gable roof. They are mostly small one- or two-storey unit farmhouses with a cattle shed at the back. A barn is usually built onto the end. The ground floor may be made of stone. The knee wall ("Kniestock") or upper storeys are usually made of wood. Stone-weighted shakes formed the original roof coverings; later replaced by interlocking tiles ("Falzziegel"). The broad eaves of the roof were designed for with the high levels of precipitation in the low mountains in mind. They offered good drainage of rainwater and dry open-air storage. In switching the roofing to tiles, the roof pitch often had to be increased, something that can easily be seen from the beams on the roof ridge. Tiles were favoured in the 20th century because they reduced fire insurance premiums.
The house entrance is almost always on the eaves side. In the Bavarian Forest Museum Village, however, there are several houses with an entrance at the gable end. In front of the main door is the so-called "Gred", a usually cobbled, rain-protected path along the eaves side. The house door opens into a corridor, the so-called "Flez". The first door towards the gable leads immediately into the living room or "Stube", which is usually square, with two windows in the gable and a door on the eaves side.
On the gable end on the upper floor, rarely on the eaves side, it is common to have a balcony called the "Gang" or "Schrot". This balcony is very often boarded for up to a few square metres, probably as protection against the rigours of the harsh climate. The king post ("Firstsäule") is one of the few decorative elements, but also fulfils the function as a means of hanging up various things. The eaves side of the upper storey is also used externally. The bracket beams ("Konsolbalken") were adapted so that boards, rods, ladders and the like could be stored here in the dry.
In the forest areas there were rarely wealthy farmers. As a result, the Waldlerhaus is often small. The smallest ones are called "Sacherl" or "Gütl". A Waldlerhaus is also used in many larger farms as an "Austragshaus" for the older generation, as they hand over the farm.

Šventaragis' Valley

Šventaragis' Valley is a valley at the confluence of Neris and Vilnia Rivers in Vilnius, Lithuania. According to a legend recorded in the Lithuanian Chronicles, it was where Lithuanian rulers were cremated before the Christianization of Lithuania in 1387. Maciej Stryjkowski further recorded that it was the location of a pagan temple dedicated to Perkūnas, the god of thunder. While the legends are generally dismissed as fiction by historians, they been studied and analyzed from the perspective of pagan Lithuanian mythology by Vladimir Toporov, Gintaras Beresnevičius, Norbertas Vėlius, Vykintas Vaitkevičius, and others. 
Legend.
Duke Šventaragis (from the legendary Palemonids dynasty) selected a beautiful location in a valley at the confluence of Neris and Vilnia Rivers and ordered his son Skirmantas to establish a temple where he would be cremated after his death. He also ordered other Lithuanian dukes and nobles to be cremated here. Some years later, Grand Duke Gediminas was on a hunt and stopped in the valley. There he had a dream about a howling Iron Wolf which pagan priest Lizdeika interpreted that Gediminas should built the capital of Lithuania at this location. Thus, Gediminas became the founder of Vilnius. The legends, as recorded by the Lithuanian Chronicles, do not mention any kind of temple at the location.
Historiography.
These legends were retold and elaborated upon by various historians, including Maciej Stryjkowski and Teodor Narbutt, and became very popular. In his work, published in 1582, Stryjkowski elaborated that the valley has a temple dedicated to Perkūnas, the god of thunder, maintained an eternal flame, and was located where Vilnius Cathedral stands today. Narbutt, citing the dubious Chronicle of Rivius, even provided a description of the temple's measurements and the rituals performed within. 
There is a continued academic debate whether the legends were rooted in a historical fact that there was a pagan temple in Vilnius. A pagan temple, demolished and replaced by a Catholic church, was mentioned in a 1388 papal bull of Pope Urban VI. However, the papal bull is vague in its wording and the descriptions of King Jogaila's actions are similar to those in the Book of Deuteronomy (12:3–4). In 1980s, archaeological research by Napaleonas Kitkauskas and Albertas Lisanka uncovered remnants of an earlier square structure under the present-day Vilnius Cathedral. Historians proposed that it was the remnants of a cathedral built by King Mindaugas after his conversion and coronation in 1253. They further argued that, after Mindaugas' assassination, this cathedral was converted into a pagan temple. However, in 2010, Gediminas Vaitkevičius published a monograph in which he dated the remnants to 1300–1320 based on artifacts found at the site. This dating is supported by the Letters of Gediminas (written in 1323–1324) that mention a newly built church. Kitkauskas rejected Vaitkevičius' arguments.

Exmatriculation

Exmatriculation is the removal of a student's name from the list of current students when they leave a university. It refers to the deregistering or unenrolling of a student as a result of graduation, expulsion, inability to pay school fees, meet academic progress requirements or their self withdrawal from the university.
After exmatriculation.
In cases of voluntary withdrawal, some schools, depending on their various conditions, may reimburse part of the fees if the student applies for it. Unlike after a leave of absence, continuation of your studies following voluntary exmatriculation may be faced with difficulties.
Expelled students are usually barred from being readmitted into the university from which they were exmatriculated. However, in different cases, there are various exceptions and conditions for reapplying into the same university. There have also been cases of students whose expulsion was welcomed by the public's pressure and protests to revert it. Students who were exmatriculated due to failure to meet payment deadlines or continuous academic progress can also apply to be readmitted within a period of time depending on the school.

Tufted sole

The tufted sole ("Dexillus muelleri") is a species of flatfish from the family of true soles Soleidae. It is the only species in the monotypic genus "Dexillus". It is found in the Indian and western Pacific Oceans.
The tufted sole is found over seabeds which consist of sand, mud, gravel, and sea grass bottoms on the inner continental shelf, they are frequently recorded as coming into bays and the mouths of estuaries. They feed on a variety of benthic invertebrates and the maximum recorded standard length for this species is 221mm.
This species has been recorded from India and Sri Lanka, east through the Malay Archipelago and northern Australia to Tonga, Fiji and American Samoa. Its northern limit is the Philippines. It is of minor commercial importance.
Two other species, "Brachirus macrolepis" and "Synaptura megalepidoura", which have both been placed by some authors in the genus "Brachirus", alongside "Dexillus muelleri", are also placed in the genus "Dexillus" by some authorities.

The Four Ceremonial Occasions

In Korea, the marking of traditional milestones in life is known as The Four Ceremonial Occasions, or Gwanhonsangje (Hangul: 관혼상제). The four rites of passage celebrated in this tradition are the coming of age (Gwallye; Hangul: 관례), marriage (Hollye; Hangul: 혼례), death, or the funeral rites (Sangrye; Hangul: 상례), and rites venerating the ancestors (Jerye; Hangul: 제례). The word "Gwanhonsangje" (Hangul: 관혼상제) is a generic term made up of the first letter of each word ("gwallye", "hollye", "sangrye", "jerye").
History.
The word "Gwanhonsangje" (冠婚喪祭)' was first used in the classic book "Ye-gi" (예기禮記), and has since been used in many other works describing various rites. Similar weddings and other practices have been observed since the period of the Three Kingdoms., although it is unclear whether the concept of a Confucian wedding ceremony was firmly established at that time. There are brief records of weddings and practices evoking the Chinese example, but the exact form this took is not clear.
Three Kingdoms.
In Goguryeo (Hangul: 고구려) at one time, a man would work at the house of a married woman for a certain period.
Goguryeo had a custom of preparing funeral goods and conducting funeral rites to the accompaniment of music. Other customs established in the past included singing to mark the end of the period of mourning after death, and wearing mourning for three years.
In Silla (Hangul: 신라), it is surmised from records showing that partners bowed to each other, and held a feast after the ceremony that there was a ritual similar to the Confucian wedding.
According to the text 삼국지三國志 (the "Records of the Three Kingdoms", 魏志 東夷傳), in this part of Korea at that time, there was a fixed period for the wearing of mourning dress and holding of funeral rites. Also in Silla (Hangul: 신라), burial on the burial grounds was banned for a period of five years during the reign of King Jijeung, when the mourning law was established.
In Baekje (Hangul: 백제), rites were similar to those observed in Goguryeo. Thus, during the Three Kingdoms period, the traditional wedding ceremony was similar to the Confucian rites.
Goryeo.
In the early Goryeo period (Hangul: 고려), pictures from the Song dynasty relating to the Confucian rites were delivered to Goryeo. During the reign of Goryeo dynasty king Seongjong, the major institutions of the kingdom were reorganized according to the Confucian system, and Chinese Confucian rituals were imported at this time. It appears that Confucian-style practices were only followed by the upper class, with no systematic observance by the general population. The Confucian rites began to spread, with active acceptance of one of the Chinese texts on etiquette, 가례家禮, by officials of the later phase of the Goryeo dynasty.
Joseon.
The Joseon dynasty (Hangul: 조선) adopted Neo-Confucianism as its ruling ideology, and the institution of "Gwanhonsangje" was established as a Confucian system. Various policies were implemented to establish the system of Confucian rites. As a result, books relating to etiquette (예서禮書) written in the Joseon style began to appear from the early 16th century. The government also made it mandatory for bureaucrats to sit a test on the ritual. Notably, codes concerning institutions and ceremonies were compiled during the Joseon era, and these institutions and ceremonies were made a part of the education system. In the 16th and 17th centuries, thanks to the academic work of scholars, the Korean stage-of-life rituals became generalized, under the name of "Gwanhonsangje". More than 200 books were published; evidence of Joseon interest in the lifelong ceremony. Of note is the fact that the "Gwanhonsangje" ceremony of the Joseon dynasty did not simply follow the Chinese example, but rather adapted it to the Joseon context. After the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592, "Gwanhonsangje" became a universal rite of passage. At the end of the Joseon Dynasty, the arrival of Western culture saw the beginnings of change in the traditional ritual.
Japanese rule.
In 1934, the Governor-General of Korea modified "Gwanhonsangje", declaring a "rite rule" which forced the simplification of rituals in the name of modernization. This rule did not acknowledge "Gwallye", only recognizing "Hollye", "Sangrye", and "Jerye" as formal ceremonies.
Today.
The changes to daily life brought about by industrialization and urbanization led to societal acceptance of many changes to the rituals, including shorter funeral and mourning rites, and a reduction in the number of services. The wedding ceremony became an event and, accordingly, planned weddings grew in importance. Funeral directors emerged as a new profession, with funeral halls and funeral companies fulfilling the customary requirements. The advent of memorial service agencies gave rise to the memorial service. These new professional service providers take over the role of the individual in the practice of the rite, ensuring the smooth progress of proceedings even where the individual is inexperienced in the method or procedures of the rite. With these changes, various religious rituals are entering an era of diversity.
The Four Ceremonial Occasions.
"Gwallye".
This practice is one of the ceremonies held in the East Asian countries that follow the Confucian cultural tradition (China, Korea, Vietnam, and Japan). It developed from the coming-of-age ceremony in which primitive societies recognized minors as adults. "Gwallye" celebrationsare usually held for a man between the ages of 15 and 20, and a woman over the age of 15. Although the man or woman is still single, he or she is treated as an adult after the ceremony.
Traditional "Gwallye".
The meaning of coming of age is defined in the classic Asian book on manners, the "YeSeo" (Hangul: 예서): “to awaken responsibility as an adult, and its purpose is to make one perform one’s duties.”
"Gwallye" (Hangul: 관례; Hanja: 冠禮) and "Gyelye" (Hangul: 계례; Hanja: 筓禮) refer to the annual ritual, which is a coming of age ceremony (Hangul: 성년례) awakening a child's development to maturity and granting him or her responsibilities and duties as an adult.
To mark the "Gwallye" ceremony, a man, on reaching an age between 15 and 20, ties his hair in a topknot (Hangul: 상투) and puts on a crown.
In the "Gyelye" ritual, a woman who is over the age of 15 takes on an adult appearance by wearing a "binyeo" (Hangul: 비녀), or ornamental hairpin, along with other sorts of attire.
Today, the traditional "Gwallye" and "Gyelye" ceremonies have virtually disappeared, and are seldom performed. In the modern era, the third Monday of May is designated the 'Coming-of-Age Day', and on this occasion governments and organizations conduct annual 'Adult Day' events.
Modern coming of age.
Until the mid-20th century, most traditional coming of age ceremonies took the form of inviting new adults to the homes or village when they reached the age of 20. With industrialization and urbanization, these traditional customs fell out of use. To counter the disappearance of this rite, instil pride in traditional culture and teach the social meaning of the traditional ceremony celebrating the transition to adulthood, a modern coming-of-age celebration model has been developed. From 1999, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism was the lead proponent of this model. Since 2014, the official ceremony has been organized by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. The civil law reform of 2013 lowered the age of majority from 20 to 19. When young people reach the age of 19, the relevant unit within the Ministry brings them together, and the president of each organization hosts a simple event. Today, the traditional coming of age celebration event is hosted by Sungkyunkwan University.
Other than the official ceremonies organized by the state, few special ceremonies held in the home to celebrate coming of age. The practice is to offer greetings or a gift to the person reaching adulthood. Generally, friends celebrate on Coming of Age Day with a gift of roses, perfumes, kisses, or according to each person's request. Roses symbolize ongoing passion and love, and at the traditional age of 20 (now 19), 20 roses were given to mark the person's age. Perfume symbolizes good memories, represented in the form of scents. Kissing symbolizes a responsible love, accompanying the attainment of maturity with adulthood.
Organizing body.
The annual modern Coming of Age Day celebration was originally hosted by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.
On September 6, 2006, this role was transferred to the National Youth Commission. The National Youth Commission was replaced by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in 2008, when the department was reorganized. In March, 2010, the department changed again.
From 2014, the agency was assigned to the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family.
Hollye.
"Hollye" is the name for the Confucian wedding procedure. In earlier times, the age for marriage was 30 for men and 20 for women. In modern times, marriage has been permitted from age 15 for men and 14 for women (under some circumstances as young as 12). Today, people usually marry at 20 or later.
Traditional Wedding.
"Uihon" (Hangul: 의혼; Hanja: 議婚) is a ritual in which the families of the bride and the bridegroom consider the appearance, education and personality of the marriage partner. If the two parties reach agreement, they approve the marriage. This is called "myeonyag" (Hangul: 면약; Hanja: 面約). In principle, marriage is agreed to by consent of both sets of parents. However, the wedding may only proceed if the couple do not share the same surname and family origin (Hangul: 동성동본), and provided that it will not take place during the one-year span of a mourning period. "Nabchae" (Hangul: 납채; Hanja: 納采) is the term that designates the sending of a letter from the groom's house to the bride 's house, bearing the groom's "saju" (Hangul: 사주).
"Yanji" (Hangul: 연길; Hanja: 涓吉) refers to the setting of a wedding date by the bride's house, and its communication to the groom's house, in response to a letter of proposal, or "saseong" (Hangul: 사성), sent by the bridegroom. "Nabpye" (Hangul: 납폐; Hanja: 納幣) designates the bridegroom sending a box called a "ham" (Hangul: 함) to the bride's house the day before the wedding ceremony, covering wedding expenses. The procedure of sending funds to the bride's house to cover wedding expenses, accompanied by a marriage letter in the "ham", is an expression of gratitude for the approval of the marriage. "Chinyeong" (Hangul: 친영; Hanja: 親迎) describes the bridegroom going to the bride's house, where the ceremony is held, and bringing the bride with him. This is the first ceremony in which a bridegroom is present in the bride's house. "Jeonanlye" (Hangul: 전안례; Hanja: 奠雁禮) is a ritual in which the bride and her family greet the bridegroom and hold the wedding, "daelye" (Hangul: 대례). "Cholye" (Hangul: 초례; Hanja: 醮禮) is the ritual in which the bride and groom meet for the first time and are united in wedlock.
Stages.
The stages of the traditional marriage rites are as follows:
"Sangrye".
"Sangrye" (Hangul: 상례; Hanja: 喪禮) is the name of the ceremony accompanying burial of a deceased person after their passage through the final gateway of death. Similar to the beliefs held in many societies, death is believed to be more than the ceasing of biological activity, and to involve the soul's transitioning from this world to another. These concepts are reflected in certain acts of the "Sangrye" ceremony, which can take many different forms in South Korean practice
Among conventionally practiced types of "Sangrye" ceremony are Shamanistic "Sangrye", Buddhist "Sangrye", Confucian-style "Sangrye", and Christian "Sangrye". These variants may also be combined. Today, Confucian-style "Sangrye" is more commonly practiced, and is considered the most traditional form.
"Jerye".
In early times, humans were in awe of the changes in nature, and believed. that people would only survive and flourish if they acted in harmony with those natural changes, such as the cycle of the seasons. They also thought that all things were filled with spirit. Based on this understanding and conjecture, they began praying for human safety and wellbeing. Since those times, with the development of civilization, the ceremony has become more formalized, and this is also referred to in Confucianism as "Jerye" (Hangul: 제례).
"Jerye" is a courtesy term covering the holding of many ancestral rites, and is a statement of etiquette concerning ancestor worship. Among the various kinds of "Jerye" are "Gije", "Seeje", and "Myoje".
"Jerye" (Hanja: 祭禮)는 is an act of expressing sincerity by offering sacrifices of food to the spirit, the soul of the dead, and to demons, including the god. In East Asian culture with a Chinese influence, the ceremony for New Year, or "Chuseok", is called "Chalye" (Hangul: 차례). In a narrow sense, it expresses devotion to the god in East Asian Chinese-influenced culture. In broad terms, it refers to all of the rituals involving the offering of sacrifice, relating to shamanism, ancestor worship, and animism.
The following foods are prohibited at a memorial ceremony and may not be served or placed on ritual tables:
According to traditional belief and rules still applied, the ghosts hate red and garlic. There is also a rule that a man wearing a "hanbok" and making a sacrifice should wear full Korean dress (Hangul: 도포) and the traditional Korean overcoat (Hangul: 두루마기).
Ancient rules.
The following rules originate in, or are derived from, an ancient "Jerye" event (Hangul: 제사와 관련된 사자성어):
Modern Ancestral Rites.
Funerals typically take place over three days, with different rites performed on each day.
First day: on the day a person dies, the body is moved to a funeral hall. Clothes are prepared for the body, which is laid in repose in a chapel. Food is then prepared for the deceased. This takes the form of three bowls of rice and three kinds of Korean side dish. There must also be three coins, and three straw shoes. This step may be cancelled depending on the religion of the deceased's family's.
Second day: the funeral director washes the body and shrouding is done. A family member places uncooked rice in the mouth of the deceased person. (This step may not be performed, depending on the family's religion.) The body is then transferred into a coffin. Family members, including close relatives, wear mourning dress. Typically, mourning dress for a woman includes Korean traditional attire, or "Hanbok", and for a man includes a suit. Clothing must be black. The ritual ceremony begins after the clothes have been changed and foods prepared for the deceased. Details of the ceremony differ according to the family's religion. After the ritual ceremony, family members greet the guests.
Third day: the family decides whether the body will be buried or cremated. If burial is chosen, three members of the family sprinkle dirt on the coffin three times. If the body is cremated, there are no specific actions to perform. The only requirement is an urn to hold the ashes and a place in which the urn will be kept.
People who come to the funeral bring condolence money. A food called "Yukgaejang" is served to guests, often accompanied with the Korean alcoholic beverage soju. Columnist Hwang gyo-ig has made the criticism that there are no seasonal foods in the current ceremony.
The current priesthood is not a tradition that has been handed down from the past, but rather dates from the Korean War. In addition, some Protestants and Muslims reject it as idol worship. In Catholicism, after the decision of Pius XII to accept communion, the priest makes sacrifice without new wine. This is often replaced, however, with a prayer. Buddhism is increasingly entrusting memorial services to temples.

Ponerorchis luteola

Ponerorchis luteola is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, native to south-central China (north-west Yunnan).
Taxonomy.
The species was first described in 1996 as "Neottianthe luteola". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of "Neottianthe", "Amitostigma" and "Ponerorchis" were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. "Neottianthe" and "Amitostigma" were subsumed into "Ponerorchis", with this species becoming "Ponerorchis luteola".

Guillaume Pontifs

Guillaume Pontifs was a 15th-century French master builder.
Biographie.
Pontifs was appointed master mason of the Rouen Cathedral on 17 May 1462 and succeeded Geoffroi Richier. He remained in this position until 1496. He introduced the systematic use of skylights in the cathedral, which will be taken up again in the future at Évreux, Fécamp and Eu.
He continued the work of Jenson Salvart and Geoffroi Richier in the redevelopment of the north fenestration crossroads of the transept. He also completed the Saint-Romain tower with the construction of a high floor, covered with an axe roof with curved slate panels from 1468 to 1478. It housed nine bells.
From 1477 to 1479, he completely took over the canons' bookshop (chapter library) built by Jenson Salvart, and built the "Booksellers' staircase" which allowed access from the transept of the cathedral, in 1479. He made the first two flights. The following two were made in 1788, to access the new floor of the archives, while respecting the original Gothic style. The front gate of the Cour des Libraires was completed in 1484.
The chapel Saint-André/Saint-Barthélémy du Revestiaire is closed by a slightly curved stone fence, executed in 1479 at the request of the archdeacon Philippe de La Rose and a wrought iron door. It opens to the east on the great sacristy known as "sacristy of the canons" and to the west on the revestiaire (canons' changing room).
The western façade is visually unbalanced by the unique presence of the Saint-Romain tower. Pontiffs began late 1485 a tower south of the facade, the "Butter Tower", under the archbishop's residence of . It was financed by the alms paid to compensate the right to use dairy products during the Lent. Jacques Le Roux, who succeeded him, completed it in 1506.
Guillaume Pontifs died in 1497.

Guoji Zibai pan

The Guoji Zibai "pan" () is an ancient Chinese bronze rectangular "pan" vessel from the Western Zhou dynasty (1046 BC–771 BC). Excavated in Chencang District of Baoji, Shaanxi during the Daoguang era (1821–1851) of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), it is on display in the National Museum of China in Beijing.
The Guoji Zibai "pan" is the largest known bronze plate in the world. It enjoys the reputation of the best bronzeware in the Western Zhou dynasty (1046 BC–771 BC). The Guoji Zibai "pan", the San Family Plate (), and the Mao Gong "ding", are known as the "Three Important Bronzewares in the Western Zhou dynasty".
Description.
The rectangular Guoji Zibai "pan" resembles a bathtub. It is high, long, and wide. It weighs . The four corners are regular fillets and the four feet are all in rectangular shape, and hidden at the bottom of the plate making the mouth of the plate appear large while the bottom small. On each wall outside of the plate, there are two beast heads with rings in the mouths, and decorative patterns in the shape of ware band.
Inscription.
According to the inscription, the Guoji Zibai "pan" was cast by Guoji Zibai (), a nobleman in the Western Guo State (1046 BC–687 BC) in the Western Zhou dynasty (1046 BC–771 BC). The plate was cast in 816 BC, the 12th year of King Xuan of Zhou. Guoji was a major branch of the Guo lineage that ruled the Western Guo, and Zibai was his courtesy name.
According to the inscription on the plate, in the 12 year of King Xuan of Zhou, also the year of 816 BC, Guoji Zibai was appointed by King Xuan to lead the army to battle with the nomadic tribe Xianyun in the north shore of Luo River, and gained a complete victory. Guoji Zibai cut the enemy's ears off and offered it to the King Xuan, King Xuan held a grand ceremony to honor his achievement and bestowed him a lot of horses and weapons to praise him. Guoji Zibai specially cast the bronze ware to memorize the military operation and honor.
The plate was cast in 816 BC, and the writing technique of the inscription on the plate was very similar to those of the "Classic of Poetry", which was the earliest collection of poetry in China.
Function.
In ancient China, water held in small plates was used for washing hands and faces, and in large plates it was used for baths. The rings on the outside walls of the plate were probably designed for carrying the plate to pour water conveniently. the Guoji Zibai "pan" was large, heavy and inconvenient to use in daily life. It seemed that it was more suitable to hold things in a large volume, just like "Jian" (), which was used to hold ice cube in ancient China. According to the set of etiquette at that time, when a high-ranking official died, his body should stay in the mortuary for seven days. In summer, ice was a must to prevent the body from decaying. Therefore, maybe the plate was a container used for holding ice cubes. But there has been no authoritative final conclusion about the exact usage of the plate in the academic circle.
Discovery.
Qing dynasty.
According to "Prefecture Records of Luzhou" (), the Guoji Zibai "pan" was unearthed at Guochuansi of Baoji, Shaanxi, in the Daoguang period (1821–1851) of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Xu Xiejun (), the then magistrate of Mei County, purchased the plate for silver from a local peasant. And he brought the plate to his house "Tianyou Hall" (). In April 1860, it fell into the hands of Chen Kunshu and became the treasure of the Mansion of Prince Protector.
In May 1864, namely the 3rd year of Tongzhi period of Qing dynasty, Liu Mingchuan (1836–1896), general of the Huai Army, led the troops of Qing Empire to fight with the Taiping Army, and finally liberated Changzhou. When Liu moved into the mansion, his soldiers didn't know the plate and used it as a manger. One night when reading a book under the oil lamp, Liu heard clear metal clanks from out of the window. All was quiet at dead of night, so the clanks sounded clear and loud. Liu came to the stable following the sounds, and saw that a horse was eating grass with the bronze rings on the headstall hitting the manger from time to time to make the clanks. Liu was so curious that he bent to look carefully with the lantern, and found the manger wide and deep with fuzzy decorative patterns on its four sides. Liu tried to push the manger but failed. It was very unusual and he decided to check it out after the dawn. The next day he ordered his attendants to carry out the manger and wash it. The bronze ware was very exquisite and Liu was very fond of it. He immediately sent his trusted followers to transport the manger to his hometown, Hefei in Anhui. Liu specially invited Huang Congmo () who was familiar with ancient Chinese characters to help him research the bronze ware. Huang told him that most of bronze plates discovered in the past were round, and rectangular bronze ware was very rare, and such a large and rectangular plate was even more scarce and, or even might be the only one of its kind. And the inscription clearly showed that the bronze plate was cast by Guoji Zibai of the Western Guo State. After Liu understood the story of the manger he decided to protect it. Liu specially built an exquisite pavilion in his house, which he named "Plate Pavilion" () to preserve the plate. Huang made a piece of rubbing from its inscription and copied a lot of copies. Huang sold it on the market. Weng Tonghe (1830–1904), a collector and teacher of Guangxu Emperor, wanted to buy the plate but Liu refused. Weng told the Empress Dowager Cixi on Liu Mingchuan and complained about that. But Liu's superior Li Hongzhang explained that. Empress Dowager Cixi decreed to bestow the plate on Liu Mingchuan. In 1885 he was appointed the first provincial governor of Taiwan by the Qing government, a position he held for almost ten years until his retirement. From then on he lived a retiring life and didn't care about national affairs any more. The plate became his spiritual ballast in his declining years. In 1894, the Qing army were routed in the First Sino-Japanese War and the Qing government was forced to sign the "Treaty of Shimonoseki". When hearing the news, Liu was furious that he became illness suddenly and died with indignation. Before he died, he told his children again and again that the plate was a national treasure and they should protect it even risking their lives.
Republic era.
In 1911, the Xinhai Revolution was broke out, China was torn by warlords. Some warlords began to covet all kinds of national treasures that they knew heard of. The Guoji Zibai "pan" in the Liu Family was no exception. In May 1933, the then governor of Anhui Liu Zhenhua came to Liu's home in the name of visiting the descendant of Liu Mingchuan. When meeting Liu Suzeng (), the fourth generation-son of Liu Mingchuan. Liu Zhenhua first flattered him with a beaming face, then he changed the topic, saying that he want to see the plate. Liu Suzeng said calmly that his ancestors did actually collect a plate, but they had never seen it. Liu Zhenhua suddenly turned hostile and commanded his soldiers to search the house. They searched everywhere but found nothing there. Liu Zhenhua sent spies to watch every movement of the Liu Family in the hope of finding where the plate was. The Liu Family spent the next four year in fear and trembling.
In 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident was broke out, the Japanese army soon colonised the north China. After occupying Hefei, the Japanese army set a stronghold less than away from the Liu Family. Soon after, they sent a message to the Liu Family that they would like to change a golden plate of the same size for the Guoji Zibai "pan". Liu Suzeng answered immediately that they didn't have any treasure and if they had, they didn't want to be unworthy descendant, or the bad apples of the country to sell it to foreigners. Liu Suzeng thought it over and over and finally hit upon a good idea, they dug a big hole in their yard, and buried the plate in the hole and planted a little locust tree on it. In order to avoid the danger, the Liu Family moved to other places with same personal belongings at night to seek asylum. When the Japanese heard this, they made a wide and sweeping search of the Liu's house but found nothing. Finally, they set a fire on more than 30 buildings and than left.
After the surrender of Japan, the Liu Family returned to home. Li Pinxian (1892–1987), a KMT general and the then governor of Anhui, ordered Liu Suzeng to hand over the plate, but Liu refused. A few days later, Li Pinxian deliberately said that Liu had stolen the box full of gold bars, and forced Liu to write the iou. The Liu Family had to flee their home to seek asylum again. Li Pinxian came to Liu's house with his troops, they looked around the house and dug the yard to a depth of three feet but found nothing.
People's Republic era.
In October 1949, after the establishment of the Communist State, the Ministry of Culture asked official from all over the country to rescue the treasures of cultural relics scattered from the folk. Wu Guichang (), chief of the CPC Feixi County Committee, heard the news that the Guoji Zibai "pan" is preserved in the Liu Family. Wu went to Liu's house many times and asked Liu Suzeng to donate the cultural relic to the country. Guo Chongyi (), a local member of the Chinese Democratic League, came to Liu's home with a document of the Central Government. After reading the document and talking with Guo Chongyi, Liu Suzeng decided to donate the treasure to the new country with a bronze drum of the Three Kingdoms period (220–280) together. On February 28, 1950, the Liu Family officially donated the plate to the Ministry of Culture. The government awarded Liu a certificate of praise and honor. Till then, the Guoji Zibai "pan" had accompanied the Liu Family for 86 years and been passed down by four generations. The Ministry of Culture gave the treasure to the National Museum of Chinese History. Later, the National Museum of Chinese History gave the relic to the National Museum of China. The Guoji Zibai "pan" has always been kept there since that time.

Kuriakose was born in the village of Swargakunnu. His parents are farmers, and he doesn’t have any siblings. Being a single son, his parents brought him up with utmost care and love. but he grew up as a coward, afraid of the dark and death. Even after passing age 30, Kuriakose remains lazy, refusing to go to work or leave his home. He was shocked to hear of the death of his friend and former classmate, Biju. This constant fear causes him to believe that his cholesterol and BP is high, so he makes a juice out of chili peppers as advised in Social media and health magazines to lower them. However, this juice causes him to have severe pain. His parents and neighbours try to take him to the hospital, but Kuriakose refuses to go because of his fear. The constant fear, shame and pressure from his family forces him to leave home, mentally unstable. On his way to the junction, Kuriakose sees the poster of missing motivator and singer, Chandra Das, causing him more fear.
His Pastor and the church prays and searches for Kuriakose without informing police. But Kuriakose, in his mental instability falls into a pit. In that same pit, he sees the body of Chandra Das. Fearful, he hides the body with dried leaves and mud. This experience helped Kuriakose finally to gain some courage. Meanwhile, Sandhya, a girl who is tortured by her father and his friends, runs away from home and coincidentally falls into the same pit.
In the pit they were trapped for around four days. After hearing Sandhya’s past, Kuriakose decided to support her and live together. Kids playing next to the pit found Kuriakose and Sandhya trapped there. The villagers rescue them and the police recover Chandra Das' dead body from the pit. Kuriakose, having found a suicide note, hands it over to the police as evidence. Kuriakose's mother and father object to his union with Sandhya as she is from a different caste, but the Pastor defends them. Sandya’s father also tries to stop them, but the reformed Kuriakose’s decision was strong and he decided to live in Swargakunnu together with Sandhya.

Paul Stenning

Paul David Stenning (born 12 June 1976) is an English author, ghostwriter and poet. He has written twenty-nine books, of fiction, non-fiction, poetry and biography. The best-known of his books is "The Robert Pattinson Album", a biography of Robert Pattinson, first published in 2009 and appearing in seven languages since then. 
According to WorldCat Stenning has released 30 works in 106 publications in 7 languages.
Early life.
Stenning was born in Brighton in East Sussex. He had trials with the Brighton &amp; Hove Albion youth team and wanted to be a footballer or a writer. Stenning's primary school teacher remarked that he would be a writer at the age of four. 
His family moved to Manchester when he was eight years old. Stenning attended Urmston Grammar School amongst others, including Bury Church of England High School. He did not attend college or university. Despite early encouragement at school, Stenning is a mostly autodidactic writer.
Career.
Stenning wrote poetry through his late teens and submitted his first poem in late 1999, which was published as part of an anthology titled "Magical Memories", a year later. 
During this time he worked with Take That and Peter Kay.
He also worked as a DJ, often playing sets before live concerts, particularly before shows at the Manchester Apollo. Stenning's sets appeared before concerts by No Doubt, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Bruce Dickinson. He also once worked at a famous toy store where he met Karel Poborsky.
Stenning has said music was his first love and he wrote music reviews for fun during his teens. In the mid-1990s he submitted reviews to "Metal Hammer" where he soon became a regular contributor. Other music magazines he wrote for included "Rolling Stone", "Record Collector", "Metal Maniacs", "Decibel", "BraveWords", "Terrorizer" and "Alternative Press". He has also written for "FHM", "Front" and, after moving to Cyprus in 2008, the "Cyprus Weekly".
He has conducted hundreds of interviews including Meat Loaf, Pete Best, Alice Cooper, Steve Guttenberg, Kathy Sledge, Peter Steele, John Myatt and Linda Hamilton. Stenning's interviews often run over the allotted time allowed. He spoke to Peter Steele and Leslie Easterbrook for almost 3 hours despite an interview restriction of an hour. Easterbrook told Stenning he asks "great questions".
In 2006, Stenning interviewed Steven Adler live onstage at The Cavern Club in Liverpool.
Stenning's work on Guns N' Roses was cited as the most accurate book on the band by guitarist Slash.
Since 2009 Stenning has worked primarily as a ghostwriter, working with Patty Schnyder, Jason Newsted, Frank Abagnale, Tomáš Berdych, Slash, Steven Adler, Margaret Nolan, Adam Dubin, U.S. Marshals 15 Most Wanted Fugitives Jody K Thompson and British champion wrestler Ray Robinson.
Stenning was considered as ghostwriter for the memoirs of Amanda Knox due to his sensitivity and empathic interview style and ability to deal with harsh subject matters, the same reason he was chosen to handle the memoir of David Gill, the controversial owner of South Lakes Safari Zoo.
In 2013 Stenning released "Success – By Those Who've Made It", which featured Mario Andretti, Jörgen Elofsson, Ching He Huang, Cherie Lunghi, Roy 'Chubby' Brown, Greg Merson, Susan Polgar, Phil Gallagher aka Mister Maker and Penelope Spheeris.
Anne Wafula Strike was the last personal biography featured in the book, which Stenning explained was because her story was the most powerful and the greatest example of success.
After the book was released, Stenning gave talks on success at corporate events, festivals and schools.
He is working on biographies of Archbishop Makarios III and Jayne Mansfield, which he considers "labours of love". In 2011 he met Margaret Nolan who was thinking of writing her memoir.
Stenning describes Tommy Vance and especially the Friday Rock Show as big influences on his early career. He dedicated his biographies of Iron Maiden and Slash to Vance.
Asked in 2015 if he would like to write an Axl Rose autobiography, Stenning replied, "without question". In the same interview Stenning revealed he could potentially work with Jason Newsted on a memoir in the future.
Stenning's books have been released in multiple languages with several titles in Bulgarian, Polish and Portuguese.
Since 2018 he has served as the official poet for the tourist board of Guinea-Bissau.
Stenning is a member of the Society of Authors.
Former managing director of Virgin Books, KT Forster, has described Stenning as a polymath and a ghostwriting chameleon.
Personal life.
Stenning has a wife and daughter. He travels around the world to ghostwrite and is based in the United States and Cyprus. Stenning has been an active campaigner for animal rights since his teens and is a vegetarian. He is a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
He released a podcast on the TV series Minder in July 2021.
In August 2020 Stenning expressed his support on Twitter for Rowan Atkinson and the coalition of authors and journalists campaigning against the hate crime bill.

From 1872, he served a pupilage of three years to S. W. Jenkin, during which he was engaged in connection with the parliamentary and working plans and sections of several branch lines for the Cornwall Minerals Railway, the Fal Valley Railway and the Truro and Penzance Railway. For one year from 1875 to 1876, he was a student at the School of Practical Engineering at Crystal Palace under W. J. Wilson. In 1876 he went to India, however, failing to obtain employment as an engineer, he became a pupil of H. Whymper, of the Murree Brewery, and was occupied for fifteen months on the water supply for the Murree Brewery Company in the Punjab.
Subsequently, he proceeded to Calcutta, where he was engaged by Mitchell and Co., engineers and contractors, of which he became a partner in 1881. He was first employed in building bungalows, machine-shops, engine-sheds for the Northern Bengal State Railway at Saidpore, and afterwards, during the year 1879, was in charge of the construction of 10 miles of the Darjeeling Steam Tramway. He was also concerned in the making of a road through the Teesta Valley and on the Bengal Central Railway, the Calcutta drainage works, the Dacca and Mymensingh Railway, and the Patna and Bankipore Tramway. 
During the last two years of his life he was the resident partner in the firm of Walsh, Lovett, Mitchell and Co., contractors for the Tansa water-works, for bringing a large supply of good water to the City of Bombay. During this time he had in the working season from six thousand to ten thousand men under his charge, but the anxiety arising from his responsibilities acting on a frame already much weakened by jungle fever, was too much for him, and he died somewhat suddenly from heat apoplexy at Vasind on 16 February 1889, in his thirty-fifth year.

Flinders Deal

The Flinders Deal was a deal created in 1918 between the major political parties of the time to introduce a system of preferential voting for use on a federal level for the House of Representatives in Australia. The deal was introduced as an attempt by the Hughes Government to prevent the right-of-centre parties from splitting their support to the benefit of the Labor party.
The deal receives its name from the by-election responsible for its creation. In 1918 the Victorian electorate of Flinders had a by-election after the resignation of Nationalist MP Sir William Irvine. The Victorian Farmers Union had proposed to run a spoiler candidate to stop the Nationalist Party candidate, Stanley Bruce from winning the election. To prevent this, the Nationalist party formed a deal with the Victorian Farmers Union to introduce preferential voting so long as the Victorian Farmers Union party did not run a candidate. The Victorian Farmers Union kept to the agreement and in October of 1918, after witnessing the devastating affects to the Nationalist Party vote at the Swan by-election, the Hughes government swiftly introduced preferential voting which allowed for the first Victorian Farmers Union candidate to be elected to the House of Representatives on preferences, despite having 4000 fewer primary votes than the Labor candidate James Scullin.

Battle of Sukho Island

The Battle of Sukho Island, also known as Operation Brazil, was an amphibious operation and naval engagement on Lake Ladoga between the Soviet Navy and a German Luftwaffe naval detachment during World War II.
Background.
During the Siege of Leningrad the Soviets moved supplies to the city through Lake Ladoga. The Axis deployed the Finnish Ladoga Naval Detachment, Naval Detachment K (including the Italian XII Squadriglia MAS), and the German Luftwaffe Einsatzstab Fähre Ost, to interdict the route; MAS conducted torpedo boat attacks. The combined Axis force failed to significantly interrupt traffic.
The culmination of Axis operations was the raid against Sukho Island, 20 km from the southern shore of the lake, which covered supply lines and the approaches to Soviet bases.
Axis forces.
The attack was commanded by "Oberstleutnant" Wachtel. The flotilla was composed of 16 Siebel ferries, 7 infantry boats, and the Italian motor torpedo boat MAS-526. Seven ferries (SF-11, SF-13, SF-15, SF-17, SF-21, SF-23, SF-25) were fitted with heavy weapons. Four ferries (SF-12, SF-14, SF-22, SF-26) were fitted with light weapons. A 70-man landing party was carried aboard three transport ferries (T-2, T-4, T-6), and allocated five of the infantry boats. There was also one headquarters and one hospital ferry.
Battle.
The German ferries were escorted at a distance by MAS-526; critically, surprise was lost when they were detected by Soviet minesweeper TSch-100, which joined the battle later. The Axis landing party landed on Sukho under the cover of the armed ferries; two of the three Soviet 100mm guns were destroyed, and the lighthouse was damaged but not taken. The landing party withdrew after sustaining casualties and losing radio contact.
On the lake, multiple German ferries grounded around the island. SF-12 grounded on rocks, followed by SF-13 while attempting to assist. SF-22 grounded after being disabled by the remaining Soviet 100mm gun; SF-14 and SF-26 grounded attempting to assist. A Soviet patrol boat was damaged and retreated under a smoke screen. The arrival of Soviet gunboats and MO patrol boats forced the Axis to withdraw after having refloated SF-14 and SF-22.
Soviet naval and air forces pursued but inflicted only minor damage on the retreating Germans; attacks by the Soviet motor torpedo boats TK-61 and TK-71 scored no hits, while the Germans claimed four hits on a Soviet ship. The German retreat was slowed by ferries suffering machinery failure. SF-21 was used as a rearguard; it silenced the remaining gun on Sukho but was then abandoned and scuttled - along with infantry boat I-6 - when it began to sink from leaks and pump failures.
Aftermath.
The Axis suffered heavy casualties for little result, and marked the effective end of offensive Axis operations on Lake Ladoga. 17 of the 23 participating German ships were sunk or seriously damaged.; four armed ferries (SF-13, SF-21, SF-12, SF-26) and one infantry boat (I-6) were lost, and SF-22 was heavily damaged. Crew and troop casualties amounted to 18 killed, 57 wounded and 4 missing.
Total Soviet losses are 9 KIA, 15 WIA. Beyond naval losses, the Germans took six prisoners from Sukho.

Classic Snooker

Classic Snooker (also known as Tournament Snooker) is a sports simulation video game developed and published by Anco Software in 1987. "Classic Snooker" simulates the cue sport Snooker, and was released in both 16 bit and 64 bit graphics for the Commodore 16 and Commodore 64.
Overview.
"Classic Snooker" is played on a traditional Snooker table, with the ability to play against the AI, or against an opponent.
Reception.
The game received mixed reviews from critics. Computer Gamer magazine scored the game at 84%, and were positive about the game's mechanics, despite bugs, saying "The action does slow down if more than three balls are moving but this is acceptable as the whole thing is flicker free and as a bonus loads in only a few seconds." German gaming review magazine Aktueller Software Markt (ASM) scored the game at 62% saying "The game itself is quite entertaining and realistic. The running of the balls on the table, the effect, the change of direction after the billiards and the playing of the games were pretty well done."
ASM were however, less positive about the game's presentation, saying "A major disadvantage of the program is that it is extremely difficult to distinguish the colors of the balls from each other. So it is hardly possible to recognize the pink, brown and red balls as well as the yellow and the white ball." ASM were pleased with the graphics despite this, saying "Of course, the mentioned drawback spoils the fun, but this disadvantage is offset by the quite realistic presentation." Zzap! 64 reviewed the game, commenting on how the poorly the game ran on the Commodore 16 system, saying that the game "plays okay, but the screen tends to flicker quite violently at times and can prove most off-putting."

Diuris pedunculata

Diuris pedunculata, commonly known as the small snake orchid, is a species of orchid which is endemic to New South Wales. It usually has two leaves at its base and one or two yellow and orange flowers with purple markings. It originally occurred in scattered populations between Tenterfield and the Hawkesbury River but because of habitat loss is now only known from the New England Tableland.
Description.
"Diuris pedunculata" is a tuberous, perennial herb with two erect, linear to thread-like leaves long and wide. One or two pale yellow flowers with an orange labellum, wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is narrow egg-shaped, angled upwards, long and wide. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long, about wide and angled downwards. The petals are narrow elliptic, long, wide, spread apart from each other and droop downwards on a dark coloured stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is broadly egg-shaped, wide and the side lobes are triangular, about long and wide. There are between two irregular ridge-like calli long at the base of the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs in August and September.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris pedunculata" was first described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in his "Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen". The specific epithet ("pedunculata") is a Latin word meaning "small, slender stalk".
Distribution and habitat.
The small snake orchid was originally found in scattered populations between Tenterfield and the Hawkesbury River but is now only known mostly from areas around Armidale, Uralla, Guyra and Ebor. It grows in moist, grassy places and in open forest.
Similar orchids occurring in south-east New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Tasmania have been reinterpreted as "Diuris subalpina".
Ecology.
This orchid appears use sexual deception, attracting mostly males of the native bee species, "Halictus lanuginosus" for pollination, even though the flowers produce nectar and emit a strong scent that attract other insects.
Conservation status.
"Diuris pedunculata" is listed as "endangered" under the Australian Government "Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999" and under the New South Wales "Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016". The main threats to the species include habitat loss and fragmentation, grazing and trampling by livestock, weed invasion and the activities of feral pigs.

Henriëtte Pimentel

Henriëtte Henriquez Pimentel (17 April 1876 – 17 September 1943) was a Dutch teacher and trained nurse who during the Second World War headed a crèche in Amsterdam which cared for small children while their parents were otherwise occupied. Together with Walter Süskind and Johan van Hulst, from around October 1942 she helped to save the lives of hundreds of Jewish infants by smuggling them into the homes of sympathetic host families. After being arrested by the Nazis in April 1943, she died in the Auschwitz concentration camp the following September.
Biography.
Born in Amsterdam on 17 April 1876, Henriëtte Henriquez Pimentel was the youngest daughter of the diamond cutter Nathan Henriquez Pimentel (1837–1893) and Rachel Oppenheimer (1841–1929). Together with her seven siblings, she was brought up in a well family. After following a teacher's training course, in the 1920s she worked as a governess and a kindergarten teacher in Bussum. As she had also trained as a nurse, in 1926 she was appointed director of the "Vereeniging Zuigelingen-Inrichting en Kindertehuis" (Crèche and Kindergarten Institute) in Amsterdam. Founded with support from a Jewish legacy, it was a large, well-fitted modern establishment on the Plantage Middenlaan which accommodated up to a hundred infants and toddlers who were cared for by a team of mainly Jewish staff.
In 1941, as a result of the German occupation, Pimentel was forced to dismiss her non-Jewish colleagues. By autumn 1942, the crèche had become a hostel accommodating Jewish children whose parents were taken to the Hollandsche Schouwburg on the other side of the street. Once a theatre, it had been converted into a centre for Jews scheduled for deportation to the Westerbork transit camp.
The children in the crèche were also to be sent to Westerbork. In collaboration with Walter Süskind at the Jewish Council and Johan van Hulst who ran the neighbouring teachers training college, Pimentel made arrangements for as many as possible to be smuggled out to families willing to look after them, some as far away as Friesland or Limburg. For several months, the scheme went undetected as the children's names were removed from the transport schedules. Some of them were temporarily housed in the teachers training college while others were cared for by student groups or other resistance cells. Some sources estimate that up to a thousand were saved in this way, others around 500, but the large majority continued to be deported. The operation was code-named "N.V.", short for "Naamloze Vennootschap" meaning "limited company."
The Nazis arrived at the crèche on 23 July 1943, removing all the remaining children and all the staff. Pimentel was sent first to Westerbork, then to Auschwitz where she died around 17 September 1943.

Capitol Theatre, Singapore

Capitol Theatre, briefly Kyo-Ei Gekijo, is a historic cinema and theatre located in Singapore. It was adjoined to four-storey building known as the Capitol Building. The Capitol Theatre was considered as one of the Singapore's finest theatres in the 1930s during that time.
History.
In 1929, Mirza Mohammed Ali Namazie, a Persian businessman of the Namazie family, commissioned the theatre to be built in Singapore, with S. A. H. Shirazee, an Indian-Muslim merchant and community leader, and the South African brothers Joe and Julius Fisher from First National Pictures, joined in to form Capitol Theatres Ltd as its operator. Namazie would serve as the theatre company's chairman with Shirazee as director, Joe Fisher as managing director and his brother Julius Fisher as the publicity manager.
Architecture and equipments.
Joe Fisher travelled overseas to acquire the materials for the theatre's furnishings, decorations and design. The Capitol Theatre was designed neoclassical architecture by British architects Keys and Dowdeswell, with its general plan, seating arrangements and lighting inspired from the Roxy Theatre in New York, United States. Builders Messrs Brossard and Mopin began construction of the foundation around July 1929.
Messrs Sherwin-Williams Paint Co. in collaboration with local partner Messrs Lohmann and Co., designed the theatre's walls' and ceilings' detailing.
Although installed with ventilation system, the theatre's roof was able to slide open which leave a 40-foot aperture for more ventilation.
The first layout of the theatre could accommodate at least 1,600 people, with 1,100 seated on the ground floor. Another 500 seats were available at the circle that could be accessed via lifts or staircases. The seats were a few inches wider than normal British cinema seats, and the upholstery was supplied by a New York company.
The theatre had a large projection room located below the balcony and ran the length of the building instead of being traditionally sited in the rear. It housed the latest Simplex projector installed with fireproof protection shutters. The theatre's acoustics and soundproofing were said to be exceptional at that time. Special expensive sound installations costing at least 40,000 Straits dollars were imported from Western Electric Company.
The theatre's stage was also designed for stage productions, with changing rooms and organ chambers built into the theatre. It was also the first to equip multihued lighting system using concealed lamps with a dimmer function, which was never used in other existing theatres in Singapore at that time.
Besides having the floodlit main entrance at the junction of Stamford Road and North Bridge Road, there are also two side entrances from Stamford Road and North Bridge Road, with a parking lot to accommodate at least 200 cars.
There were several food outlets at the theatre. The main café on the first floor had a dance floor where cabaret was held at the selected nights, and adjoining the café was a restaurant known as the Capitol Restaurant. A café lounge was located at the circle. A special cooling room for making French pastries was built in the kitchen on the ground floor. Its adjoined building known as Namazie Mansions, which was named after the Chairman Namazie, was completed in the early 1930.
Official Opening.
In 22 May 1930, Capitol Theatre officially opened on the evening with much fanfare with musical comedy film "Rio Rita", the theatre was hailed as having the most modern auditorium with the largest capacity in the Far East. Several specially prepared short films were screened to demonstrate the quality from its installed sound system. These were an overture, Capitol March, a cartoon "Finding His Voice" demonstrating the workings of the sound system; and the recorded inaugural announcement by the Capitol's managing director, Joe Fisher. However, during the first screening at 6.15 pm, there was a mechanical fault from the faulty sound projection, which was then corrected by the 9.15 pm show.
Operations under the Namazies.
Joe Fisher, who became a pioneer in the Malayan cinema industry alongside with his brother Julius, was responsible for purchasing films' rights for the theatre, which was able to gain exclusive first-screening rights for Paramount Pictures and Universal Studios productions, along with exclusive distribution rights for Radio Pictures. The theatre would also screened the British Pathé Sound News, as well as a new film for every week.
Capitol Theatre soon faced with issues, including the sudden death of Chairman Namazie in 1931, strict censorship laws and the competitions with other theatres which hurt its operations financially. In 1933, Joe and Julius Fisher started "The Mickey Mouse Club" to attract business. They later brought in the "Marcus Show", a revue with a chorus line of 60 dancing girls, thus making the theatre and its various eateries a popular hangouts for the local youths.
Early movie stars such as Charlie Chaplin, Ava Gardner, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks visited the theatre to promote their movies when they were in Singapore.
In September 1939, the theatre was refurbished, seats were replaced with new upholstered ones, installed an air-conditioning system and had its vestibule redesigned and was completed by 31 January 1940. On the following day the theatre screened "The Wizard of Oz" to mark the occasion, and gained ahead of its competitors.
In 19 December 1941, the colonial government requisitioned Capitol Theatre, which was closed after one show and also the closure of the Capitol Restaurant to serve as a food depot while the Mansions continued as the residential flats.
Operations under the Japanese.
Following the Japanese Occupation of Singapore from 1942, the theatre was taken over by the Japanese to serve as a food deport and operated under the name Kyo-Ei Gekijo, its English-language movies would later be forbidden after a few months and the theatre would only screen Japanese feature and propaganda films as well as orchestras.
The theatre operated until 1944, when a bomb planted by the anti-Japanese resistance fighters exploded, damaging its facade and the Mansions as well.
Operations under Shaw Organisation.
After the war in 1945, Capitol Theatre and Namazie Mansions had since put under mortgage by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Later in 1946, Shaw bought over the buildings for $3 million and made the Capitol Theatre as its flagship cinema and renamed its adjoined Mansions as Shaws Building. In the late 1948, renovation of the buildings started which included repairing the damaged structure and new ballroom and restaurant known as Capitol Ballroom &amp; Restaurant with a function room named Capitol Blue Room on the first floor.
Its supposed reopening of the theatre on 30 March 1951 was delayed for 24 hours, due to the late arrival of the equipment needed for the Scandinavian Ice Revue to install the ice rink in the theatre. The theatre was officially reopened in 31 March 1951 at 9.15 pm to host the first ice show in Singapore.
In 23 December 1952, the Capitol Chinese Restaurant was opened in the Capitol Blue Room in the evening, which specialised in Shanghai and Szechuan food prepared by cooks from China.
From the 1951 to the 1960s, the theatre was also the venue for hosting "Miss Singapore" and "Miss Malaya" beauty pageants. The Variety show "Musical Express" and Singaporean musical group "The Quests" were held at the Capitol from the 1960s onwards.
In 1978, Shaw Organisation put up Capitol Theatre and Shaws Building for sale, however no deal had been reached. Shaw Organisation later revealed plans to acquire the land of nearby Capitol Shopping Centre and to demolish Capitol Theatre and Shaws Building and redevelop the site into a shopping complex and a multiscreen cinema with commercial and residential apartments.
However, under the Control of Rent Act 1953 of Singapore penal code, the Shaw Organisation had to provide compensation to its current tenants which proved a challenge to them.
In February 1984, the Singapore Government gazetted the two buildings for redevelopment and later acquired the buildings from Shaw in 1987, for which the Shaw Organisation became the leasee for the use of the theatre and the building.
In 1989, the theatre closed for a two-week renovation with the cost of S$700,000 with rewiring, reequipped with the new sound system and projectors and painting of the cinema hall and reopened 26 October 1989 with "Lethal Weapon 2". The Shaws Building also underwent renovations and was relaunched on 30 April 1992 as the Capitol Building for commercial purposes.
On 29 December 1998, the Capitol Theatre screened its last film "Soldier", and was officially closed on the following day.
Redevelopment.
In 2000, the Singapore Tourism Board took over the two buildings to explore alternative uses for it, but plans to turn it into a home for an arts group was languished and the cost of refurbishment was exorbitant and was commercially unfeasible.
On 3 April 2008, plans of redeveloping the Capitol Theatre, Capitol Building, Capitol Centre and Stamford House as a single integrated site was first publicised in a news report carried by "The Straits Times". By redeveloping the 4 developments as one, it would allow for the Theatre to run as a "loss leader" among the other 3 commercial developments. The 4 adjoining developments had a total area of about with a total of 250 tenants, including offices and retail outlets. With most of the tenants moving out by May 2009, Singapore Land Authority would inform the tenants of the need to move when details of the development of the site had been finalised. Other than the Capitol Centre, the other three buildings were gazetted for conservation on 16 July 2007, meaning that these buildings' facades must be maintained.
In November 2011, Shimizu Corporation was awarded the redevelopment project to develop into a large scale mixed use complex called "Capitol Development". With Grant Associates working closely with the project's lead architect, Richard Meir and Partners Architects, the project consists of Singapore's largest cinema cum theatre complex, 6 stars luxury hotel &amp; retail shops, with an approximate Gross Floor Area (GFA) of , and on the site of the former Capital Centre, a shopping mall, Capitol Piazza and residential tower, Eden Residences Capitol, with an approximate GFA of . As it was common to jaywalk on the roads between the St Andrew's Cathedral and the Capitol Centre prior to the redevelopment, the new development was connected to the nearby City Hall MRT station via an underpass stretching towards the Capitol Piazza.
The Theatre having left vacant for more than 10 years, it was infested with rats, its plaster was falling, ornaments were missing, and water had seeped into its floors. During the restoration process, original design details were uncovered such as "the gilding on the plaster mouldings, and the fine features of the two ‘Pegasus’ reliefs" that were painted over multiple times. Additionally, the original Persian Zodiac ceiling mural as was not salvageable, it was recreated instead. The original fly tower was taken down, and a whole new basement was excavated as well, while having to maintain the structural integrity of the building and the surrounding buildings as well.
New technology was incorporated into the Theatre to modernise it. An automated, rotational seating system was installed, allowing the Theatre to turn into a multi-functional venue to accommodate a large variety of events. The system would allow for up to 800 seats with 452 seats transformable. Additionally, half of the season would be used by Golden Village (GV) to screen movie blockbuster premieres, and it had also installed servers and projectors in the venue, allowing the venue to host red carpet events as well. The other half of the season would be dedicated to local performing arts groups.
Reopening.
The redevelopment of the Capitol Singapore complex had since completed and its topping out ceremony was held in 3 April 2014. The Capitol Theatre was reopened in 19 May 2015 after the 17 years hiatus with the world premiere of "".

SICPA

SICPA (acronym for the former name "Société Industrielle et Commerciale de Produits Alimentaires," no longer in use) is a Swiss company that provides security inks for currencies and sensitive documents, including identity documents, passports, transport and lottery tickets. According to the Counterfeiting Intelligence Bureau's International Anti-Counterfeiting Directory, SICPA provides more than 85% of the world's currency inks. The company is also involved in the market for secure traceability of products subject to excise duties, such as alcohol and tobacco stamps, and regulated products, such as halal products.
A highly secretive company, SICPA employs roughly 3,000 employees and has offices and manufacturing sites in 30 countries worldwide.
History.
Beginnings.
The company was founded in 1927 by Maurice Amon (1880–1959) in Lausanne to sell Swiss agricultural products, at that time primarily milk and cream, after Amon invented a new type of milking grease that facilitated the milking process. SICPA quickly moved to inks for printers to serve the growing demand in the Lausanne region.
After World War II, Maurice Amon's sons Albert (1916–2010) and Salvador (1912–1993) directed the company towards sophisticated inks with characteristics that deter counterfeiting. In 1948, the Spanish 100 Peseta note was the first in the world to be printed using SICPA's security ink.
In 1952, SICPA established a joint venture in Lausanne with Gualtiero Giori, an Italian printing specialist. In 1965, Giori founded a company with a British competitor firm, De La Rue, the world's oldest printer of banknotes.
Worldwide expansion.
Since then, the company has extended its worldwide market reach. In 1982, the company won a contract from the US Bureau of Engraving and Printing to provide the ink for the US Dollar. In 1987, the first bank note using OVI colour-changing ink was issued in Thailand. The firm also supplied the inks for the new Euro notes in 2002.
That same year, SICPA acquired the security ink segment of American company Flint Ink.
SICPA's factory relocated to Chavornay in 1990.
The company underwent restructuring in 1996 following a failed investment in Australia. As a result, two Swiss banks, the Société de banque suisse (SBS) et la Banque cantonale vaudoise (BCV), took partial control of the firm, Albert Amon retired, and his sons Philippe and Maurice joined the board of directors.
In 2001, SICPA entered the market for authentication and traceability solutions through the launch of a "Product Safety" division, offering anti-counterfeit solutions and improving the collection of taxes on products such as tobacco, alcohol and currently also Medical cannabis.
Three years later, in 2004, the first track and trace contract was signed with the government of Malaysia. Other contracts were signed for tobacco tracing in California (2005) and Massachusetts (2010), Brazil (2007 and 2010 for beer and tobacco), Turkey (2007), Morocco (2010) and Kenya (2013).
SICPA also used to be active in the production of packaging inks, but sold that business to German company Siegwerk in 2005 for an undisclosed amount. The acquisition made Siegwerk the second largest manufacturer of packaging ink in the world.
SICPA acquired the production unit of Italian company Olivetti I-Jet in 2014, after having already purchased the R&amp;D unit the year before. It is also present in Ecuador. Also in 2014, SICPA acquired Cabot Security Materials Inc., based out of Albuquerque, New Mexico.
With cannabis becoming legal in several US states for medical purposes, SICPA introduced its cannabis tracking program to the US, notably in California.
Organization.
Key figures.
A secretive company, SICPA does not publicly communicate its business figures (number of employees, offices, location of the latter etc.). However, the firm's turnover was estimated to be $750 million in 2003. Its employees are estimated to have increased from 1,100 to 3,000 between 2007 and 2013 due to several acquisitions, 400 of which work at the company headquarters in Prilly. Resulting from internal reshuffling of two of its tracing business units, an estimated 100 employees have been made redundant since 2014. A "reorganization plan" affected 150 employees in 2017.
Governance.
From 2000 to 2003, Jean Daloglou was the CEO of the group. From 2003 to 2005 the position was held by Jan Secher. SICPA is now owned and managed by Philippe Amon, his brother Maurice Amon having left the company.
Business segments.
The company's activities are divided into three main segments:
Each year, 76 billion products are marked with SICPA inks according to the company in 2017.
Controversies.
A highly secretive company, SICPA has been regularly quoted by both media and politicians for either potential corruption practices (Brazil, Kenya and Morocco) or some of its lobbying practices (France, Ecuador), but has never been sentenced for any wrongdoing.
Americas.
In 2015, the company was accused in Brazil in an investigation by the federal police concerning the conditions under which it was awarded the contract by Casa da Moeda. Charles Nelson Finkel, reportedly paid bribes of $32 million to finance ministry officials to secure the contract worth several billion euros. As of 2018, the case is still pending. Casa da Moeda has since elaborated on the contract award conditions in a note detailing the tendering procedure and the contract with SICPA was canceled. SICPA claims to have committed no irregularities and to be cooperating fully with the authorities. The Brazilian government continues to work with the company, particularly for the tracing of tobacco products (SCORPIOS contract), which was extended in 2017.
Kenya.
In 2016, SICPA was criticized in Kenya for the way it obtained a public contract in 2012. Raila Odinga, former Prime Minister of Kenya, accused SICPA of "illegally obtaining a contract for more than one 100 million Swiss francs from the Nairobi Finance Department (Kenya Revenue Authority, KRA)." "La Tribune de Genève" also reports that according to the Kenyan press SICPA "had obtained the contract well before it was added into the Kenyan trade register. It also did not meet the authorities' criteria." However, the Swiss newspaper also points out that "there is no document to support a possible malpractice in Kenya [and that] KRA is very satisfied with the services provided by SICPA". However, SICPA denied irregularities, insisting that the contract was awarded fairly. In a parliamentary hearing, Maurice Juma, director of Kenya's Public Procurement Oversight Authority (PPOA), said that "Under the procurement law, the contract was processed through fraudulent means and it cannot be sustained". However, SICPA received a temporary relieve when the PPOA attested the tender procedures prior to the awarding of the contract a "clean bill of health."
In 2018, Kenya's High Court ruled that the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) had not adequately followed constitutional provisions in terms of public consultation when imposing excise duties on bottled water, juices, soda and other non-alcoholic beverages. The contract the KRA had with SICPA for the supply of the duty stamps was annulled, but KRA appealed the ruling and on 11 May received permission to continue the implementation of the excise goods system.

Lowan Conservation Park (formerly Lowan National Park) is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Bowhill about east of the state capital of Adelaide and about west of the town of Perponda.
The conservation park consists of crown land in sections 71 and 73 in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Bowhill. Section 71 was purchased by the South Australian government on the advice of “the Land Board and National Parks Council” from the owner “who were anxious to see scrub remain on the block.” It acquired protected area status as the Lowan National Park on 9 September 1971 by proclamation under the "National Parks Act 1966". On 27 April 1972, it was reconstituted as the "Lowan Conservation Park" upon the proclamation of the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972". On 2 August 1973, land in section 73 of the Hundred of Bowhill was added to the conservation park. As of 2016, it covered an area of .
In 1980, it was described as follows:An area of mallee scrub supporting breeding populations of mallee fowl and wedge-tailed eagles. A gently undulating area of mallee scrub the principal species being "Eucalyptus socialis", "E. gracilis" and "E. Dumosa" with an understorey of acacia species. Rabbits are abundant in the park and excessive grazing is preventing adequate regeneration of some species. The surrounding land is developed for the wheat / sheep agricultural industry.
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

Ata Bozaci

Ata Bozaci (born March 3, 1974 in Burgdorf) is a Swiss graphic designer, illustrator and artist. His work encompasses drawing, painting, digital graphics, large-scale wallpainting and modular sculpture. From 1990-2012 his principle creative output was graffiti writing; he is known for graffiti works under the pseudonym Toast. People – man – are central to his recent digital works.
Life and Work.
Bozaci grew up in a working-class Turkish family. His drawing talent was already recognised in primary school. From 1990-1991 he undertook a foundation course at an art and design school. From 1992-1996 he studied in the graphics department at the Schule für Gestaltung (Design School), Bern. For his graduation work he made the first ever sprayed comic. His desire to connect graffiti with graphics almost cost him his place studying. In 1992 he was invited to take part in a group exhibition with H. R. Giger at Art Frankfurt. In 1995 he designed the artwork for hip-hop band Fettes Brot’s album ‘Auf einem Auge blöd’. Further graphic commissions followed within the Bernese club and cultural scene, including a collaboration with the cult magazine SODA.
Bozaci graduated from his graphic design course when he was 22 and started working freelance in Bern. He produced 15 skateboard designs for Intersport in collaboration with the graphic design studio Büro Destruct.
While Bozaci was an intern at Springer &amp; Jacoby in Hamburg he developed a close friendship with Mirko Reisser DAIM / getting-up. In 2001 they and other artists realised a 2000 m2 graffiti installation opposite Hamburger Harbour wharf, on the exterior wall of the Blohm + Voss shipyard at Dock 10, entitled ‘Das neue Hamburg und seine Partnerstädte’ (The New Hamburg and its Twin Cities).
In 2007 Bozaci was awarded his own colour by spray-paint producer Molotow, called ‘TOAST signal black’.
Artistic career.
In the late 1990s Bozaci established the company Atalier Visual Entertainment with business partners Remy Burger and Patric Geissbühler, concentrating on online game commissions. They became the most successful firm in their sector, with Die Mobiliar, Swiss Dairy Producers and the Swiss Post among their clients. In 2004 Atalier won Bronze in the Swiss Dialogue Marketing Prize. By 2007 Bozaci left Atalier in order to work purely as an artist.
The art collector Gunter Sachs invited Bozaci, alongside Basel graffiti writer Dare, to design his apartment at the Schlosshotel Velden. Linked by the title ‘Point of View’, the artists painted six immersive pictures which merge into one complete image from just a few points of view. The work was illustrated in full in the Architectural Digest (AD) magazine. For the special exhibition ‘Die Kunst ist weiblich’ about Gunter Sachs’ life and work at the Museum der bildenden Künste (Fine Art Museum) in Leipzig, Bozaci realised a large-scale picture on steel. Bozaci's collaboration with the Galerie Springmann from Freiburg began in 2008. Group exhibitions followed with Dare, Stefan Strumbel and the street art pioneer Blek le Rat. Two works from Gunter Sachs’ collection, ‘Satan in Heaven ’and ‘Black devil’ sold well above their estimates at Sotheby's auction house in London in 2012. In 2014 two further Bozaci works were auctioned at Karl&amp;Faber in Munich.
Private life.
From early on Bozaci travelled widely in Europe. Thanks to his contact with the US street artist Dave Pursue, he was able to work with the skateboard company Osiris in San Diego. He criss-crossed Mexico with the rock band ‘disidente’. Two months in Cuba and numerous inspirational trips to Australia, China, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore followed.
Bozaci lives in Zurich with his wife and daughter.
Works.
Graffiti.
The works Bozaci produced between 1990 and 1996 under the alias Toast were marked by cartoonish figures. Although he began spraying lettering, for a long time Bozaci was recognised as one of the most important graffiti figure sprayers. His signature approach was to make marks that do not reveal how they were made using the simplest means.
Letter Architecture.
The ‘Letter Architecture’ series was ongoing from 1996-2008. These works were characterised by the use of heightened perspective, resulting in immersive works in which the letters merge with their architecture.
Modular Sculptures.
Bozaci adapted a characteristic property of graffiti writing – the intuitive inscription of letters in a space. Various basic forms, such as a rectangle, triangle and circle, became the building blocks of his sculptural writing. These are large, multi-part figures that could equally be models for futuristic buildings. ‘For me graffiti and architecture are closely linked. For that reason, a move into tangible objects is logical.’ In 2011 ‘MLS Modular Letter System’ made from modular sculptural elements was shown at ‘The First Beijing International Design Triennial’ in the National Museum of China.
Hype Balloon.
In 2011 Bozaci designed a large inflatable sculpture. The word HYPE is repeatedly blown up, only to collapse in on itself again. During the Grafik 12 exhibition Bozaci orchestrated a performance using the balloon: disguised as a graffiti sprayer he sprayed his own work and was ultimately taken away by police.
Linear and Digital Portraits.
Bozaci took up boxing in the early 2000s. From this experience emerged the solo exhibition ‘Lineares Boxen’ at The Trace Gallery in Zurich in 2013.
From this period onwards Bozaci's works have become more socio-critical. His attitude to social media was visible in the 2015 travelling exhibition ‘Fifteen Seconds of Fame’. He transformed acquaintances’ facebook profile images into iconic portraits using digital technology. The faces are based on circle shapes. Bozaci views the perfection of a circle as emblematic of the current desire for beauty, with Facebook being the ideal place to manifest vanity and narcissism. Viewed from close up, only graphic forms can be comprehended in the portraits. Seen from a greater distance, a nearly photorealistic image emerges. Bozaci also subsequently painted digitally-created portraits as murals, among them a portrait of the Turkish writer Enis Batur. The five-metre tall picture was realised in collaboration with RAWCUT Design Studio and students from the Bomonti Mimar Sinan University in Istanbul.
Bozaci's largest mural to date can be seen in Shenzhen, China. He was invited to create an open-air gallery in 2016 to enhance a neighbourhood. The 27-metre tall work shows a brightly coloured baby attached to a smartphone.
Working with Microsoft in 2017 he created a design proposal for the Swissmill-Tower in Zurich. The work ‘Nackt-Schwimmen’ (Skinny Dipping) illustrates a mother-child relationship. Both the silo building itself and the design created controversy.

Lady Xu (徐氏, personal name unknown, 917–940), better known as Princess Yongxing (永興公主), was the fourth daughter of Li Bian (known as Xu Zhigao or Xu Gao during her life), the usurper who seized power from the Wu dynasty ruling house to found the Southern Tang dynasty. Princess Yongxing had married the Wu crown prince Yang Lian, and after the usurpation in 937 she stayed loyal to him even though she was elevated to a princess while he was demoted to "Commandery Duke of Hongnong". It has been said that she inevitably started crying every time people mentioned her by the new title "princess", conferred by her father, much to the chagrin of her older brother Li Jing (then known as Xu Jing). Her father reportedly called her a "good wife". When Yang Lian was banished to Chi Prefecture, she followed him there. She died "without an illness" shortly after her husband died under suspicious circumstances (likely murdered by her father).

Betty Cecilia Lugo

Betty Cecilia Lugo González (April 20, 1946 – September 23, 2017) was a Venezuelan philanthropist who started Special Education in the eastern region of Zulia State and founded the first Zulia state association for people with depression and bipolar disorder. She was also co-founder of the charity association "La Casa de la Misericordia" in Maracaibo, where she served as an active benefactress for 25 years.
Education and Philantrhropic activities.
She studied Medicine and Special Education, in Venezuela and in the United States, at the University of Zulia and the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma. At the end of the 1960s, she moved to Lagunillas Municipality, Zulia, where she started the education for children with disabilities in the East Coast of Lake Maracaibo (Costa Oriental del Lago de Maracaibo). In that part of the country is located a main oil production center and the area includes all major cities in the western region of Zulia state.
She moved to Maracaibo in the 1980s where she founded the first association of the state of Zulia to treat depression and bipolar disorder. She was also co-founder of the charity association "La Casa de la Misericordia" in Maracaibo, where she served as an active benefactress.
Family life.
Lugo was born in Caracas, Venezuela, on April 20, 1946.
Her parents were Raúl Lugo Montero, born in La Vela de Coro, Falcón State, and Prefect of the Maracaibo District around 1950. Her mother was Dalia Emilia González Palmar de Lugo, born in Maracaibo. She went to primary school in Caracas. She started High School in the United States and finished it in Maracaibo at "Colegio de la Presentación, where she graduated with honors.
She died in Maracaibo, on September 23, 2017. Her remains rest in the church "Padre Antonio María Claret" in Maracaibo. She is survived by her son Luis Eduardo Giusti Lugo and her daughters María Elena Giusti Lugo and Claudia Giusti Lugo.
AZUPANE-Lagunillas.
Lugo arrives at the East Coast of Lake Maracaibo in the late sixties. By that time Special Education was an unknown field and, as a consequence, it was not included in the educational programs of any public or private school. Disabled children were kept in their homes by their parents, without any interaction in society.
Lugo perceived this situation soon after her arrival in Lagunillas and started a crusade to claim attention on the problem. This is how the idea of creating a place for children with disabilities was born. She decided to start a campaign in order to found a school, where disabled children could be educated, play sports and have an active life outdoors.
The project.
Thanks to her skills on special education she succeeded in persuading ladies within local oil society to be part of a committee, in order to collect funds for the project. She also achieved that foreign oil corporations, operating in that part of the country, accepted to include the project into their donation programs.
AZUPANE-Lagunillas started on May 4, 1974, in a building with large gardens donated by Venezuelan Shell Company. A school bus was lately donated by the business community, to be used for the transportation of the students to the school.
Legacy.
AZUPANE- Lagunillas made the society of that part of Venezuela aware of the importance of special education. Lugo continued her crusade encouraging public and private bodies and corporations to start more projects on special education. When she left the oil district the school was fully settled, increasing the number of students every year. The local society had become aware of the situation of children in need of special education and the Ministry of Education envisioned similar projects. The school became lately part of the government special education program, which was developed after AZUPANE-Lagunillas and lately extended throughout that region of Venezuela. Today AZUPANE-Lagunillas is a public primary and high school for students with disabilities, called "Jesus Enrique Lossada Special Education Institute".
AZUDEBI.
In the beginning of the 1980s Betty Lugo lived in Maracaibo. During the years she lived in that city she began a project to help people suffering depression and bipolar disorder. Due to the complexity and relative misinformation of the causes of the disease, giving advice on how to cope with it was considered essential by Lugo. This motivated her to form a psychological and medical group and to create an association dedicated to help people suffering this type of disorder.
In 2006 she founded in Maracaibo the “Association Zuliana para la Depresion y el Trastorno Bipolar, AZUDEBI (Zulia Association to treat Depression and Bipolar Disorder, AZUDEBI), which was the first initiative in this field in the State of Zulia. It was created as a charity association for providing education, guidance and treatment to people with mood disorders.
Activities.
Her goal as president of AZUDEBI was to succeed every case through suitable support, permanent guidance to family members and administration of specific medical treatments. Together with these practices she started a media campaign to raise awareness about the disease.
AZUDEBI based its activities on conferences for the patients and their families, which took place in community buildings, local churches and clinics involved in the project. Professionals in medicine, psychology and psychoanalysis led the discussions and reviewed relevant subjects such as the usefulness of meditation exercises, the appropriate treatment for depression and the importance of the environment and family life of the patients.
Casa de la Misericordia (House of Mercy).
During the years Lugo lived in Maracaibo she carried out extensive work as a co-founder of the charity association, "La Casa de la Misericordia". This charity started in 1992, within the school building of "Colegio de la Presentación". It was founded together with the well-known catholic nun "Sister Francisca", with the aim of providing free medical care as well as spiritual support.
Lugo was a key player in the acquisition of a residency that lately became the headquarters of the association. She managed to get from the Government of Zulia State the donation of the house where "La Casa de la Misericordia" is currently located. She also made possible that the oil state company “Petróleos de Venezuela” PDVSA donated a bus to transport elderly people to the care center, as well as to patients with difficulties to walk or requiring wheelchairs. The new headquarters allowed “Casa de la Misericordia” to help a greater number of people in the fields of general medicine, pediatrics, gynecology, psychiatry, psychology, acupuncture and legal advice.
Lugo remained an active benefactress of "La Casa de la Misericordia" for 25 years, until her death in September 2017.

Energy in Liechtenstein

Energy in Liechtenstein describes energy production, consumption and import in Liechtenstein.
Liechtenstein has no domestic sources of fossil fuels and relies on imports of gas and fuels. The country is also a net importer of electricity. In 2016, its domestic energy production covered only slightly under a quarter of the country's electric supply, roughly 24,21 %.
Liechtenstein's national power company is Liechtensteinische Kraftwerke (LKW, Liechtenstein Power Stations), which operates the country's existing power stations, maintains the electric grid and provides related services.
Electricity.
In 2010, the country's domestic electricity production amounted to 80,105 MWh.
In 2015, the country's estimated domestic electricity production was around 68.43 million kWh.
94.2% of domestic production (76,166 MWh) was provided by hydropower, 3.12% of domestic production (3,330 MWh) was provided by fossil fuels, 2.68% of domestic production (1,361 MWh) was provided by solar or wind power generation, and 0% (0 MWh) by nuclear power generation.
In 2010, imports of electricity to Liechtenstein amounted to roughly 270,540 MWh. None of the domestically generated electric power was exported.
In 2015, imports of electricity to Liechtenstein amounted to roughly 325.2 million kWh. There were again no exports of domestically generated electric power.
In 2016, non-renewable sources accounted for 67,35 % and renewable sources for 32,47 % of Liechtenstein's electricity supply. Energy production from non-renewables consisted of 56,88 % foreign imports of electricity produced by nuclear power, and 0,65 % of electricity produced in Liechtenstein from imported natural gas. Energy production from renewables consisted of 27,71 % hydropower production (8,91 % imported and 18,80 % domestic), as well as 4,76 % produced domestically from solar energy. Liechtenstein's overall energy production from renewables consisted of 8,91 % imports and of 23,56 % domestic, non-export production.
Renewable energy.
Energy production from renewable resources accounts for the vast majority of domestically produced electricity in Liechtenstein. Despite efforts to increase renewable energy production, the limited space and infrastructure of the country prevents Liechtenstein from fully covering its domestic needs from renewables only.
Hydroelectric.
Liechtenstein has used hydroelectric power stations since the 1920s as its primary source of domestic energy production. By 2018, the country had 12 hydroelectric power stations in operation (4 conventional/pumped-storage and 8 fresh water power stations). Hydroelectric power production accounted for roughly 18 - 19% of domestic needs.
 is the oldest in the country, opened in 1927. The power station underwent reconstructions in 1946 and 1987. Today, it also includes a small museum on the history of electricity production in Liechtenstein.
, currently the largest of the domestic power stations, has been operational since December 1949. In 2011-2015, it underwent a reconstruction that converted it into a pumped-storage hydroelectric power station.
Solar.
In recent decades, renewable energy efforts in Liechtenstein have also branched out into solar energy production. Most solar energy is generated by photovoltaic arrays mounted on buildings (usually roofing), rather than dedicated solar power stations. Currently, the largest photovoltaic array in the country is the one atop the Gründenmoos tennis hall, with an installed power output of 112 kWp. Other examples include industrial buildings in Balzers (80 kWp and 70 kWp), a logistics centre in Schaan (86 kWp), an agricultural building in Triesen (40 kWp), and industrial buildings in Vaduz (40 kWp), Schaanwald (36 kWp) and Triesen (30 kWp).
Consumption.
In 2010, total consumption of electricity in the Principality of Liechtenstein amounted to roughly 350,645 MWh.
In 2015, total consumption of electricity in the Principality of Liechtenstein amounted to roughly 393.6 million kWh.

Oberholzer murder

The Oberholzer murder occurred on 4 July 1964, when members of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) attacked and killed Pieter Johan Andries (Andrew) Oberholzer, who worked as a foreman of the Silverstreams Wattle Company.
On 4 July 1964, ZANLA insurgents carried out an ambush that resulted in the killing of a white foreman from Silverstreams Wattle Company, Andrew Oberholzer, while he was travelling with his wife and family on a main road. After Mr Oberholzer's death, the attackers attempted to set his body and car alight. However, they were driven off by the arrival of another car on the scene.
The killing of Andrew Oberholzer had a lasting effect on the small, close-knit white community, even though it was an isolated incident. The Smith Administration subsequently moved to detain the ZANU and ZAPU political leadership in August 1964. The major political leaders imprisoned were Ndabaningi Sithole, Leopold Takawira, Edgar Tekere, Enos Nkala and Maurice Nyagumbo. The remaining military leaders of the ZANLA Dare ReChimurenga were Josiah Tongogara and the highly-regarded barrister Herbert Chitepo. Operating from bases in Zambia and later from Mozambique, insurgents subsequently began launching attacks against Rhodesia.

Hanauer Straße

Hanauer Straße in Munich is an arterial road about one and a half kilometers long extending from south to north in the Moosach district. It was named after the Hesse city of Hanau.
Geographical location.
Hanauer Straße branches from Dachauer Straße, opposite the Westfriedhof, as an extension of the Orpheusstraße to the north. It crosses the Georg-Brauchle-Ring after about 400 meters. After crossing this road, it connects to the Lassallestraße.
Development.
Former development.
The area of the Moosach gasworks of "Stadtwerke München" extended between Hanauer Straße, Georg-Brauchle-Ring and the Borstei. Here, between 23 April 1909 and 20 March 1967, the town gas was generated through gasification of hard coal. During this time around 15 million tonnes of coal were processed. It also produced about 500,000 tonnes of tar and tar oil as by-products. Until 1975, the site was further used for gas processing before the plant was shut down.
A large part of the area was contaminated by tar and tar oil, which had seeped underground during the period in which the gas works operated. After many years vacant, the demolition of the buildings took place in 1992. Since mid-2005, Europe's largest funnel-and-gate system, a passive cleaning process, has been in operation there. The plant is designed for over 350 m³ / h of water, which is loaded with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).
Hanauer Straße was the location of the Olympic press city in 1972.
Current development.
At Hanauer Straße 10/10a, 12/12a and 14/14a, the "Lehrkolonie Moosach" (teaching colony) was built in 1919 by the "Bayerische Landessiedlung". Three semi-detached houses, single-family small-house buildings in country house style, served as experimental buildings for the testing of alternative building materials. Today these buildings are cultural monuments under the Bavarian monument protection law.
At Hanauer Straße 54, stands the Evangelical Methodist Church of the Redeemer; the Moosach town library is at Hanauer Straße 61a.
The area to the north of Pelkovenstraße is one of Bavaria's major retail centers, characterized by commercial enterprises and multi-storey residential buildings: east of the city, the Mona (7,700 m² retail space) and the "Olympia-Einkaufszentrum" (Olympia shopping center] (56,000 m² retail space) border Hanauer Straße. Across the street are more retail spaces, each with sales floorspace of several thousand square meters (for example Conrad Electronic and Saturn Hansa stores, a furniture store and a medical center).
Future development.
East of the southern part of Hanauer Straße a bus depot and a six-storey office building are being built on the site of the former gasworks. To the south of this is a neighborhood with about 600 apartments for 1,350 people, two day-care centers and a primary school. This is then grouped around the buildings of the "Lehrkolonie Moosach".
Public transport.
Located on Hanauer Straße are the underground stations Georg-Brauchle-Ring (U1) and Olympia-Einkaufszentrum (U1/U3), at the junction with the Dachauer Straße the tram stop Hanauer Straße tram line 20/N20.
Events.
The Hanauer Straße was the main location of an attack in Munich on 22 July 2016. Five people died in a McDonald's restaurant, two more on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant and another in close proximity. The perpetrator crossed Hanauer Straße and killed another man on the east side of Hanauer Straße in the Olympia shopping center. At number 77, the top of Hanauer Straße, between McDonald's and Saturn, a memorial is to be inaugurated for the first anniversary of the act: A ten-meter-high ginkgo tree is covered by a two-meter-high and 2.5-meter-wide ring of polished stainless steel, part of the ring is sunk in the ground and allows entry. Visually, the monument resembles a friendship or wedding ring, the outside of which adorns the inscription "In Memory of All Victims of the Rampage of 22 July 2016". Each gem is dedicated to one of the victims, inside are the names. The lighting is recessed into the floor, allowing the ring to reflect in the dark. The work of art "Für Euch" (especially for you) was designed by Elke Härtel and won a design competition organized by the city council.

Arado E.583

The Arado E.583 (Arado Ar P.I ) was a project design from 1945 for a jet-powered night fighter aircraft of the German manufacturer Arado Flugzeugwerke.
History.
The design of the E.583 goes back to the E.581, an earlier project by Arado, in which design variants for a single-beam, tailless night fighter were also examined. The starting point for the E.581 was again the studies in connection with the project E.555 for a multi-beam long-range bomber. However, due to the long inlet and the large hull surface, the Heinkel HeS-011 jet engine of the E.581, which was integrated into the fuselage, could only expect inadequate performance in the high-speed sector.
Arado then created two new project designs in accordance with the guidelines issued in January 1945 for the optimal solution of a night fighter. Under the overall designation E.583, the studies Ar-I and Ar-II - also referred to as Project I and II - were presented at the same time.
The Ar-I was based on the draft E.581-5, but had much larger dimensions. The experts criticized on 20./21. March 1945 again the resistance generating engine intakes and large surfaces. Arado then improved the design so that a third crew member and a larger amount of fuel could be included. A third variant received smaller and more swept wings. Allegedly, it is said to have served as inspiration for the US Vought F7U-3 Cutlass. However, head of the aerodynamic research department of Vought, William C. Schoolfield, denied that any orientation towards German research has taken place. 
The Ar-II was regarded as an easier to implement night fighter. The design had swept wings and was strongly based on the Arado Ar 234 and the study TEW 16 / 43-23. The maximum speed was calculated at 775 km / h, lower than that of the Ar-I.
Construction.
The Ar I was designed as a tailless aircraft, in which the ailerons also served as horizontal stabilizer. The two rudders were each placed on top of the wings.

According to Hardy, she hadn't planned to release an album, but after she heard "Sleep" by Finnish band Poets of the Fall, she showed it to her friend Erick Benzi, who had similar melodies at that time, and it inspired her to write some lyrics.
Meanwhile, La Grande Sophie, who knew that she started writing again, sent her the song "Le Large" (Sailing Away) out of the blue, and she got another haunting melody from Pascale Daniel, then a song by Yael Naim brought some tears to her eyes.

Bad Education (2019 film)

Bad Education is a 2019 American crime drama film directed by Cory Finley and written by Mike Makowsky. It is based on the 2004 "New York" magazine article "The Bad Superintendent" by Robert Kolker, about the true story of the largest public school embezzlement in American history. It features an ensemble cast including Hugh Jackman, Allison Janney, Geraldine Viswanathan, Alex Wolff, Rafael Casal, Stephen Spinella, Annaleigh Ashford and Ray Romano.
Set in the Long Island village of Roslyn in the early 2000s, the film tells the story of school district superintendent Dr. Frank Tassone (Jackman) and assistant superintendent Pam Gluckin (Janney), who steal millions of dollars from the same public school district that they seek to make the best in the country. The screenwriter, Makowsky, briefly met Tassone as a child before the scandal broke and attended Roslyn High School in the late 2000s.
"Bad Education" made its world premiere on September 8, 2019 at the Toronto International Film Festival and was broadcast on HBO on April 25, 2020. It was well received by film critics, with particular praise for Makowsky's screenplay, Finley's direction, and Jackman's and Janney's performances, but criticism for Tassone's sexuality depicted in the film. At the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards, the film won for Outstanding Television Movie and Jackman received a nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie.
Plot.
In 2002, Dr. Frank Tassone is superintendent of the Roslyn Union Free School District on Long Island. Frank and assistant superintendent Pam Gluckin have overseen major improvements in the district, with Roslyn High School becoming the fourth-ranked public school in the country. The school's performance stimulates the local economy, reaping rewards for school board president and real estate broker Bob Spicer. Beloved by students and parents, Frank claims to have lost his wife several years ago, and rejects advances from some of the local mothers. Attending a conference in Las Vegas, he begins an affair with his former student Kyle Contreras.
Student reporter Rachel Bhargava is writing an article for the Roslyn school paper about a skywalk the school plans to construct, and Frank blithely encourages her to treat her article as any top journalist would. Rachel investigates the project, to Pam's irritation, and notices irregularities in the district's finances. It is revealed that Pam has a fraudulent district expense card, which she encourages her niece Jenny, a district clerk, to use. When Pam's son uses the card to shop for thousands of dollars' worth of construction materials for her home renovation, Bob is alerted by a relative working at the store.
Bob and the school board confront Pam, realizing she has embezzled at least $250,000 in taxpayer funds. Frank persuades them to handle the matter quietly, detailing the consequences a public scandal would have on the school and community. They agree to conceal the embezzlement, forcing Pam to pay restitution and resign; the board announces her abrupt "retirement." Convincing district auditor Phil Metzger to falsify the financial records, Frank appoints him as Pam's temporary replacement. Frank transfers Jenny to a less visible "special utilities" role, threatening to expose her own misuse of funds when she attempts to implicate him.
Rachel continues her investigation, uncovering evidence of the embezzlement in the form of supply orders that were never fulfilled and massive consulting fees paid to unknown companies, including Pam's husband's car dealership. She finds an annual expense of $803,000 to Wordpower Tech and visits its listed address, which she discovers is a Manhattan apartment. A man answers the door and Rachel leaves, but she and Frank spot each other when he arrives and enters the same apartment. The man is Tom Tuggiero, Frank's husband, and Rachel realizes Wordpower Tech is a front created by Frank, a co-conspirator in the embezzlement. Frank later warns Rachel of the potential fallout for exposing the story.
Phil informs Frank of an incriminating expense: Frank used district funds on first-class tickets to fly himself and Kyle to London. Frank threatens to place blame squarely on Phil for failing to catch Pam's scheme and taking part in the cover-up. Phil agrees to keep quiet, but Rachel publishes her story in the school paper, exposing Frank's key role in the embezzlement. Insisting he acted in the school's best interest, Frank pleads with Bob not to confirm the scandal until the school budget is approved, but Bob and the school board report the cover-up in its entirety.
Pam, Jenny, and Phil are arrested; when the authorities threaten to prosecute her family, Pam agrees to testify against Frank and turns over evidence of the scheme. Tom is informed of Frank's second life with Kyle, and Rachel becomes the school paper's editor-in-chief. Frank resigns, flees to Nevada with tens of thousands of dollars in cash, and moves in with Kyle in a house Frank bought for him. He is eventually arrested, returned to New York, and convicted. In prison, Frank fantasizes about being back at Roslyn, where he is congratulated for making the school #1 in the country.
An epilogue reveals that Frank was convicted of embezzling $2.2 million and sentenced to 4 to 12 years in prison. Pam, who pled guilty to embezzling $4.3 million and testified against Frank, was sentenced to 3 to 9 years in prison. A total of $11 million was embezzled, the largest school theft in American history. Due to an oversight in state pension regulations, Frank is still slated to receive his teacher's pension of $173,495.04 per year.
Production.
The screenplay was written by Mike Makowsky, who in 2004 was a middle school student in the Roslyn Union Free School District when its superintendent, Frank Tassone, was arrested for first-degree larceny. Makowsky bought the rights to Robert Kolker's "New York" article on the subject and returned to his childhood hometown to compile research for the project. He expected to write a film portraying Tassone as a straightforward villain. However, interviews with his former teachers and neighbors revealed a much more nuanced portrait of Tassone that informed the eventual screenplay. A decision was made not to involve any of the perpetrators in the development of the film, out of respect for the town of Roslyn.
Makowsky, Fred Berger, Brian Kavanaugh-Jones, Julia Lebedev, Edward Vaisman and Oren Moverman produced the film under their Automatik and Sight Unseen banners. In March 2018, Hugh Jackman entered talks to star in the film. Cory Finley (whose previous film was the Sundance darling "Thoroughbreds") was announced as director at the same time.
Jackman worked with his dialect coach, Jess Platt, to perfect his accent as Tassone. Jackman noted that, "I haven't done a film without him—except for "Australia", of course—for 20 years. I'm someone who can get to 80 percent of an accent sort of easily, but it's that final 20 percent that really makes a difference. He was on set with me yelling and screaming, and he's originally from Brooklyn, so he's around the area and knows it well."
In June 2018, Allison Janney joined the cast of the film, with Geraldine Viswanathan and Ray Romano signing on the following month. More than a dozen supporting cast members were hired in October 2018, including Alex Wolff, Rafael Casal, Stephen Spinella, and Annaleigh Ashford. Principal photography began in October 2018.
Historical accuracy.
Rebekah Rombom was described by "The New York Times" in 2004 as doing "what few high school journalists ever do: she broke some real news. Her article about the embezzlement scandal in the Roslyn School District was a major scoop." The "Times" gave a byline to Rombom to describe the events at Roslyn High over the prior several months, and in a June 27, 2004 "Times" article, Tassone had only recently resigned but had not yet been charged. Rombom writes, "School officials say that are looking into payments of several hundred thousand dollars paid to a company that lists Dr. Tassone's Manhattan apartment as its address."
Her film counterpart, Rachel Bhargava, "does a little more investigative reporting than I did" according to Rombom.
The film's description of Frank Tassone living with one man in Manhattan while secretly owning another house in Las Vegas with a 32-year-old male exotic dancer appears to be accurate except possibly for one detail: in portraying the dancer as a former student. Tassone claims: "I have never, ever, in my 36-year career in education, had a relationship with a student or with someone who had graduated."
Themes.
Jackman felt one of the film's main themes was the difference between the image one projects and the truth. He noted, "For Frank, how he was perceived and judged by people on-site was very important, and he justified that as being a part of his job, how he needed to project being upstanding to represent the school district in order for it to get to No. 1. [...] And by the way, it's a battle that most of us face in our everyday life. It starts off as a teenager when you're trying to get a boyfriend or girlfriend or someone to like you, and you're like, OK, I'm not going to try that part, what's going to work for me?"
Release.
"Bad Education" had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2019. Shortly after, HBO Films acquired distribution rights for $17.5 million in the largest deal of the festival. It was released April 25, 2020, on the HBO premium cable network and HBO's streaming services. The film was also available at the launch of HBO Max.
Reception.
Critical response.
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 150 reviews, with an average rating of 7.70/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "Anchored by an outstanding Hugh Jackman, "Bad Education" finds absurd laughs—and a worthy message—in the aftermath of a real-life scandal." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Peter Travers of "Rolling Stone" described Jackman's work as "a career-best performance from a movie star with a genuine actor's depth and range" and the script as "devilishly clever and detailed". Ben Kenigsberg of "The New York Times" chose the film as the publication's critic's pick and praised Finley's composition, Makowsky's dialogue, the set decoration, Abels' "jarring, percussive score", and Jackman's "darkly charismatic" performance.
David Ehrlich of IndieWire commended Makowsky's script as a "well-calculated masterclass in narrative economy". Jake Coyle of the Associated Press compared the film's tone and story favorably to Alexander Payne's 1999 film "Election". Coyle also singled out Janney's performance as sliding "into the movie so perfectly that it feels more like she came first and the film was sensibly built around her".
Frank Tassone spoke admiringly about Jackman and Janney's performances. He noted that Jackman "did a very good job playing me. Especially at the end, when I walk out of prison and I see what I lost. That really hit home for me. Because I did lose all of that."
TV ratings.
On its first televised airing, "Bad Education" scored an .18 rating in the 18–49 demographic.

Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture

The Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture (, abbreviated RMEL) was responsible for agricultural policy of Germany during the Weimar Republic from 1919 to 1933 and during the Third Reich from 1933 to 1945. It was under the office of the Secretary of State. On 1 January 1935, the ministry was merged with the Prussian Ministry of Agriculture, Domains and Forestry, founded in 1879. In 1938 it was renamed "Reich and Prussian Ministry of Food and Agriculture". After the end of National Socialism in 1945 and the occupation, the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture was established in 1949 as a successor in the western Federal Republic of Germany.
History.
In March 1919, the Reichsernährungsamt was the first to establish the "Reich Ministry of Food". This was combined with the Reich Ministry of Economics in September 1919 and re-founded during the Kapp Putsch in March 1920 under the name "Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture". In the same year, the ministry moved into the Palace of Prince Alexander and Prince George at 72 Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin. From 1924, four large-format paintings by August Weber were on loan in the building, and since 1945 they have been lost.
After the Nazi's seized power on January 30, 1933, the ministry was initially led by Alfred Hugenberg. Coerced into resignation during June 1933, Hugenburg was succeeded by Kurt Schmitt and Walther Darré. The latter took over on June 30, 1933 as "Reichsbauernführer" the management of the Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture, where he was in this function also created for the Gleichschaltung of agriculture Reichsnährstand. The Nazi Darré, took personal leadership of the official party apparatus belonging to the Agricultural Policy Office (from 1936 "Reich Office for Agrarian Policy", and then from 1942 "Reich Office for the country people"). The office was responsible for the management and supervision of the Reichsnährstandes. 
The RMEL, as it were, took over the state's supervision of the Reichsnährstand organization. As a result, individual areas of responsibility were gradually transferred to other NS authorities. Thus, in 1934, by founding the Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the Reich Forestry Office under the leadership of Hermann Göring was established as the highest Reich authority for forestry and hunting, timber management, nature conservation and nature conservation. The Reich Forestry was in turn united on January 1, 1935 with the Prussian State Forestry. Goring's deputy and de facto head of German Forestry was Walter von Keudell, and then from 1937 Friedrich Alpers. Furthermore, in the years 1934 and 1935, the agricultural vocational and technical education were spun off into the Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture a directorate of the Reich Ministry of the Interior. On September 22, 1938, it also followed by decree of the Reich Minister, that all research institutes derived from the fishing industry would be collected in one Reich Institute for Fisheries.

Ponerorchis oblonga is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, native to south-central China (north-west Yunnan).
Taxonomy.
The species was first described in 1997 by Kai Yung Lang, as "Neottianthe oblonga". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of "Neottianthe", "Amitostigma" and "Ponerorchis" were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. "Neottianthe" and "Amitostigma" were subsumed into "Ponerorchis", with this species becoming "Ponerorchis oblonga".

Conviviality

Conviviality, or Convivialism, is the ability of individuals to interact creatively and autonomously with others and their environment to satisfy their own needs. This interpretation is related to, but distinct from, several synonyms and cognates, including in French the enjoyment of the social company of others (convivialité), Catalan social cohesion policy (Convivència), and its contemporary understanding in English of living together with difference and diversity (see section “Contemporary Uses in Academia”). This interpretation was introduced by Ivan Illich as a direct contrast to industrial productivity that produces consumers that are alienated from the way that things are produced. Its focus on joyful simple living, the localisation of production systems, links to Marxist economics, and Illich’s simultaneous criticism of overconsumption have resulted in conviviality being taken up by a range of academic and social movements, including as a pillar of degrowth theory and practice.
History/origins.
French root ("convivialité").
One root of conviviality originated in 19th‐century France. "Convivialité" is very common in contemporary French and has also established itself in English as a common loanword, as well as more recently as a term in discussions about cohabitation in immigrant societies. Its coinage can be traced back to Jean Anthelme Brillat‐Savarin and his book Physiologie du goût from the year 1825. The gastrophilosopher understood conviviality as the situation, common at the table, when different people come together over a good long meal, and time passes swiftly in excited conversations.
See also Social connection.
Spanish root ("convivencia").
In Spanish, "convivencia" has long been interpreted literally as “living in the company of others” but in 1948 Américo Castro introduced la convivencia to mean the peaceful coexistence between different religious groups in Spain between the eighth and fifteenth centuries.
Ivan Illich.
As understood here, the term conviviality was introduced by Ivan Illich in his 1973 book, Tools for Conviviality. Illich recognised that the term in English was more likely to be associated with “tipsy jolliness” but derived his definition from the French and Spanish cognates, resulting in an interpretation that he felt was closer to a modern version of eutrapelia. Illich introduced the term as the opposite of industrial productivity, with conviviality indicating a society where individual autonomy and creativity dominated. This was contrasted with industrialised societies where individuals are reduced to “mere consumers”, unable to choose what is produced or how things are made in a world governed by a “radical monopoly”  that divided the population into experts that could use the tools and laypeople that could not.
As the title of the book suggests, the initial focus for Illich was how industrial tools and the expertise required to operate them constrained individuals’ autonomy, also arguing that these tools alienated individuals from the production processes of goods and services that shape our daily lives and led to the distortion of use values into exchange values.
Illich had a broad interpretation of tools as rationally designed devices. These included hardware used to produce goods and services that ranged from small scale items like drills to “large machines like cars and power stations”, but also productive institutions (like factories) and also productive systems that created what he called “intangible commodities…[like] education, health, knowledge or decisions”. Examples of non-convivial tools that Illich was railing against included open-pit mines, road networks and schools, this last example linking to his previous work critiquing mass education systems Deschooling Society. By contrast, convivial tools were those that promoted and extended autonomy, including most hand tools, bicycles, and telephones. Convivial tools share many similarities with the intermediate technology or ‘technology with a human face’ described in Small is Beautiful by Illich’s contemporary EF Schumacher. Indeed, in his 2012 book 'La sociedad de la abundancia frugal' Serge Latouche highlights the “human scale” of convivial tools.  
In the 1978 collection of essays published as 'Towards a History of Needs' Illich moved away from a focus on the tools of conviviality to explore the politics of conviviality which he defined as “the struggle for an equitable distribution of the liberty to generate use-values” that prioritised the liberty of those “least advantaged”. Herein, he focussed on socially critical thresholds that delimited whether conviviality was possible and argued that such thresholds should be translated into society-wide limits.
Contemporary uses in academia.
In the early 21st Century, the term conviviality has been used in a variety of contexts and with a variety of interpretations. However, there is a common understanding which is dominant in the definitions and interpretations of the term: the idea of living together with difference. This concept is employed to analyse the everyday experiences, social encounters, interdependencies and community integration of people living in diverse communities or urban settings. This understanding of conviviality is enshrined in the open access book “Conviviality at the Crossroads: The Poetics and Politics of Everyday Encounters”, which was published in 2020. This multi-authored book focuses on how people live with and are at ease with each other’s differences in diverse societies. It claims there is an urgent need to bring the three concepts of conviviality, cosmopolitanism and creolisation back into focus and into dialogue with each other.
Recent understandings of conviviality also often include analyses of racial difference, structural inequality and divergent histories within a multicultural or multi-racial community or urban space, and how these factors impact conviviality and community cohesion in both positive and negative ways. Scholars also analyse the use of public space and architecture in terms of its impact on conviviality in such diverse communities. The focus on these issues has been referred to as the “convivial turn” in academia.
Conviviality has also been applied to online contexts, in analyses of the ways in which people relate to each other and build communities online.
Contemporary movements.
Anti-Utilitarian Movement and Convivialism.
Alain Caillé, a French sociologist and founding member of the Anti-Utilitarian Movement in Social Sciences (MAUSS), defines convivialism as a broad-based humanist, civic, and political philosophy that spells out the normative principles that sustain the art of living together at the beginning of the twenty-first century. The “ism” in “convivialism” makes clear that, on a theoretical level, the systematization of social and political-theoretical perspectives must stand in the foreground. The focus is consequently a dual one: convivialism can be seen as a social scientific or political idea, while conviviality can be seen as a lived praxis. Alain Caillé published in 2020 “The Second Convivialist Manifesto: Towards a Post-Neoliberal World”, signed by three hundred intellectuals from thirty-three countries.
Degrowth.
Conviviality is recognised as one of the core concepts of the Degrowth movement, appearing in representative texts such as Degrowth: A Vocabulary for a New Era. The understanding of conviviality within degrowth is strongly influenced by the work of Ivan Illich (discussed above), namely his critique of development and overconsumption and his promotion of a society which values “joyful sobriety and liberating austerity”, creating and using “responsibly limited” convivial tools. Illich’s understanding of convivial tools as emancipatory, democratic and responsive to direct human needs stands in direct contrast to society’s current dependence on energy slaves, experts and the growth-based capitalist model of production for its tools and technologies. These ideas, and particularly this conceptualisation of conviviality, are a central part of Degrowth theory: as such, Illich’s work is considered one of the early “intellectual roots of Degrowth”.
Most texts that discuss conviviality in the recent Degrowth literature are focused on technologies (including digital technologies), as an expansion or adaptation of Illich’s focus on convivial tools. It is generally accepted within the literature that any technologies suitable for a degrowth society must be convivial. To this end, Andrea Vetter has developed the Matrix for Convivial Technology (MCT) as a Degrowth-oriented (convivial) tool for self-assessment of tools and technologies, political education and research.
Conviviality is also employed in the Degrowth literature to describe things such as public spaces, goods, and even humans. For example, Giorgos Kallis, a prominent Degrowth scholar, refers to “...convivial goods, such as new public squares, open spaces, community gardens, etc (Latouche, 2009),” and the “convivial yet simple and content, enlightened human” as the ideal “Degrowth human”). Although less common than Degrowth literature that explores conviviality in terms of tools and technologies, there are various examples of conviviality being used as a characteristic of many aspects of a Degrowth society, including society itself. Indeed, some scholars describe the transition to a convivial society as one of the three core objectives of Degrowth.
Appropriate Technology Movement.
Based on the “intermediate technology” by the economist Ernst Friedrich "Fritz" Schumacher in his work Small is beautiful, the Appropriate Technology movement encompasses convivial technological choice, to promote characteristics such as autonomy, energy efficiency, decentralization, local production and sustainable development.
Conviviality in art and design.
The various interpretations of conviviality have also attracted the attention of artists and designers across the world. Recent exhibitions and collaborations centred on one or more interpretations of conviviality include:

Madame Gagné

Madame Gagné was a photographer who worked between 1886 and 1891 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. She and her husband, Édouard C. Gagné (also a photographer) had a total of three studios over time. At least one of her prints can be found at Montreal's McCord Museum.
Madame Gagné reportedly had a rapport with the new Chinese immigrants to Montreal, and often made portraits of them and their families. Since most photographers of the time catered to more well-to-do clients, this was an unusual custom.
Her photography studio was located at 211 Saint Laurent Boulevard, which is in the heart of today's Old Montreal.

Ponerorchis ovata is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, native to south-central China (west Sichuan).
Taxonomy.
The species was first described in 1997 by Kai Yung Lang, as "Neottianthe ovata". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of "Neottianthe", "Amitostigma" and "Ponerorchis" were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. "Neottianthe" and "Amitostigma" were subsumed into "Ponerorchis", with this species becoming "Ponerorchis ovata".

Jojo Rabbit

Jojo Rabbit is a 2019 comedy-drama film written and directed by Taika Waititi, adapted from Christine Leunens's 2008 book "Caging Skies". Roman Griffin Davis portrays the title character, Johannes "Jojo" Betzler, a ten-year-old Hitler Youth member who finds out that his mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic. He must then question his beliefs while dealing with the intervention of his imaginary friend (Waititi), a fanciful version of Adolf Hitler with a comedic stance on the politics of the war. The film also stars Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson, Stephen Merchant and Alfie Allen.
Waititi crafted the screenplay in 2011, a year after his mother described the premise of "Caging Skies". He rewrote the first draft, which as a rough adaptation of the dark-toned source material did not contain much comedy; it was also in the rewritten version that Adolf's character was included. Waititi recalled the pitching process as exhausting. In 2012, it landed on the Black List, where it remained in a development limbo until several years later when Fox Searchlight Pictures showed interest in it. A tight casting schedule started in 2018, and the film started principal photography in the Czech Republic in May 2018, finishing two months later. Post-production included adding the visual effects, editing done by Tom Eagles, as well as composing the score done by Michael Giacchino.
"Jojo Rabbit" had its world premiere at the 44th Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2019, where it won the Grolsch People's Choice Award. It was later released theatrically in the United States on October 18. Though well-received by audiences and a financial success, the film's narrative remained controversial among critics. Despite this, it was chosen by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute as one of the ten best films of the year. Among its accolades is winning the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and being nominated for Best Picture at the 92nd Academy Awards.
Plot.
During the collapse of Nazi Germany in the fictional city of Falkenheim, ten-year-old Johannes "Jojo" Betzler joins the "Deutsches Jungvolk", the junior section of the Hitler Youth. Heavily indoctrinated with Nazi ideals, he created the imaginary friend Adolf, a buffoonish Adolf Hitler. Though a fanatic, at a training camp run by Captain Klenzendorf, he is nicknamed "Jojo Rabbit" after refusing to kill a rabbit to prove his worthiness. Pepped up by Adolf, he returns to prove himself, throwing a "Stielhandgranate" by himself that explodes at his feet, leaving him scarred and limping. His mother Rosie insists to the now-demoted Klenzendorf that Jojo still be included, thus he is given small tasks like spreading propaganda leaflets and collecting scrap for the war effort.
Alone at home one day, Jojo discovers Elsa Korr, a teenage Jewish girl and his late sister Inge's former classmate, hiding behind the walls of Inge's attic bedroom. Jojo is both terrified of and aggressive towards Elsa. The two are left at an impasse, as the revelation of Rosie hiding Elsa would lead to the execution of all three of them. Inspired by an offhand rant by Klenzendorf, Jojo continues to interact with her to uncover her "Jew secrets" and make a picture book titled "Yoohoo Jew", so he can "expose" the Jewish race, allowing the public to easily recognize her kind. Despite this, he finds himself clashing with innocence, and starts forming a friendship with her. Elsa is both saddened and amused by Jojo's beliefs, using surreal antisemitic canards to challenge his dogmatism. Jojo slowly becomes infatuated with the caring and engaging Elsa, frequently forging love letters from her fiancé Nathan, and begins questioning his beliefs, causing Adolf to scold him over his diminishing patriotism.
Gradually, Rosie is revealed to be part of the German resistance to Nazism; among her tasks is spreading anti-Nazi messages around town. One afternoon while she is out, the Gestapo come to investigate; Klenzendorf arrives and helps Jojo and Elsa deceive the Gestapo regarding Elsa's identity. Later, Jojo finds Rosie hanged at a gallows in the public square. Devastated, he returns home and tries to stab Elsa before breaking down in tears. Elsa comforts him and also reveals that Jojo's lost father has been working against Hitler from abroad. Jojo's beliefs on Nazism quickly shift, and starts seeing the regime's inhumanity. With no money, the pair starts scavenging food from waste bins around the city.
Following Hitler's suicide, the Allies initiate an offensive on Falkenheim. Weak in power, the civilian population, including the "Jungvolk", is armed to do battle. Despondent, Jojo hides until it ends, with the Allies winning. As a "Jungvolk", he is seized by Soviet soldiers alongside Klenzendorf, who tells Jojo to look after Elsa and then tears off Jojo's "Jungvolk" coat, then calls him a Jew so the soldiers do not execute and instead drags him away, as Klenzendorf is executed by firing squad. Fearing that Elsa will leave him alone now that she can be free, Jojo tells her Germany won the war. Recognizing her despair, he forges a letter from Nathan, claiming that he and Jojo have figured out a way to smuggle her to Paris. Elsa confesses that Nathan died of tuberculosis the previous year. Jojo tells her he loves her, and she tells him she loves him as a brother. A disheveled Adolf angrily confronts Jojo for siding with Elsa, but Jojo kicks him out a window. Outside, Elsa sees American soldiers and realizes the truth, slapping Jojo in the face for lying. They then dance, now free.
Cast.
Additionally, identical twins Gilby and Hardy Griffin Davis, younger brothers of Roman Griffin Davis, portray a series of Hitler Youth clones in the care of "Fräulein" Rahm in cameo appearances. Joe Weintraub, Brian Caspe, Gabriel Andrews, and Billy Rayner portray Junker, Mueller, Klum, and Frosch, Deertz's fellow Gestapo agents. Robert East portrays the supporting character Herr Grusch. Victoria Hogan portrays an unnamed woman. Other supporting roles include Luke Brandon Field as "Jungvolk" senior Christoph, Sam Haygarth as Christoph's friend Hans, Stanislav Callas as the soldier that dragged Jojo, Christian Howlings as the boy who accidentally launched a bazooka with Yorki, as well as Curtis Matthew as Jojo's doctor.
Rachel House starred in a scene as an American soldier who gave a speech about America saving the day in the immediate aftermath of the war. The scene was deleted from the released version, and House expressed relief over the ultimate decision, calling the scene "clever but [...] completely unneeded." Although she did not appear in the final film, she was said to be an important participant in the project, particularly to Davis, to whom she became an acting coach.
Production.
Development and writing.
Waititi had the idea for "Jojo Rabbit" in 2010, when his mother, Robin Cohen, introduced him to Christine Leunens' 2008 novel "Caging Skies". Bored of generic World War II stories that were told through the perspectives of soldiers and survivors, and aided by the background of his grandfather once fighting against the Nazis, he decided to adapt the novel. The taboo subject matter did not prevent him from pursuing the project: he looked at it as a motivation and thought of it as a challenge to be bold in filmmaking. He also considered the film a "love letter to all mothers", with a loving mother character present in the film. Waititi compared the premise of the screenplay with the Nickelodeon cartoon "Rugrats", which portrays violence through the fantastical lens of a child: "In a lot of ways I wanted to keep some sort of innocence around that stuff." A juvenile lens also meant an honest depiction of Nazism for Waititi: "Children, they don't fuck around. They will straight-up say to you, 'You are ugly.' Or, 'You are a bad dad,' or 'you betrayed me.' Some of it makes no sense, but at least they're being honest about their feelings." Another inspiration came from reading that 66% of American millennials had never heard of or had no knowledge of the Auschwitz concentration camp; with "Jojo Rabbit", he hoped the memories of the victims would remain forever and that conversations about the topic would not stop.
Shortly after Waititi had the idea for the adaptation, he sent an email to Leunens, and the screenplay was written in 2011. Waititi thought it was good timing, with various prejudices and extremism on the rise at the time. He insisted that slapstick was a fine way of telling a story with dark themes like World War II: "The world needs ridiculous films, because the world is ridiculous." The first draft did not contain Hitler, but Waititi rewrote the whole thing again shortly thereafter; the first draft lacked comedy, due to it being a rough adaptation from "Caging Skies", which Waititi described as a complete drama. Waititi decided not to make "Jojo Rabbit" a "straight-out drama" as it would make the film cliché: he instead used humor to build the narrative, then introduced drama to shock the audience. Some of the characters' names were taken from Waititi's friends, he noted. Leunens described it as faithful to the source material, yet original, comparing it to the painting "Guernica". Cohen praised the creation of Adolf and the cartoonish depiction of Nazis. The 1973 film "Badlands" was an inspiration for the relationship between Jojo and Elsa, while "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" (1974) inspired Rosie's character. Colorized documentaries such as "World War II in Colour" (2008–2009) helped Waititi "to get a sense of how things really looked": colorful and vibrant. Regarding storyboards, Waititi instructed artist Andrej Kostic only if the scene had a number of actors; this includes the final battle scene.
The premise of the film meant difficulty in garnering interest from the film industry. Waititi stated that he did not do pitches: "I just sent the script out and let that do the talking. It's very hard to start a conversation with, 'It's about a little boy in the Hitler Youth.' [...] And then when I say, 'Oh, but don't worry, it's got humor in it,' it just gets worse." Nearly losing hope, he initially thought of just producing it independently in New Zealand. The project gained attention when it landed on the Black List of top unproduced screenplays in 2012. In February of that year at the International Film Festival Rotterdam, CineMart showed interest in the script. Despite this, the film remained in development limbo; Waititi went on with other projects like "What We Do in the Shadows" (2014) and "Hunt for the Wilderpeople" (2016). While Waititi's film "" (2017) began production, Fox Searchlight Pictures showed interest in "Jojo Rabbit" after searching for "more auteur-driven movies with challenging concepts." Contrary to popular belief that "Ragnarok" sparked interest in Waititi, Searchlight looked at his earlier works, such as "Boy" (2010). TSG Entertainment later joined the project with a budget of $14 million, $800,000 of which was directed towards the art department. In total, pre-production took two months.
Waititi initially wanted to film "Jojo Rabbit" in Berlin, a place he had a deep connection with, with financing from Studio Babelsberg. However, due to human rights and filming restrictions in Germany, with minors only able to work three hours a day, he decided to move filming to the Czech Republic. Babelsberg was credited with assisting development alongside the New Zealand Film Commission. The Czech Film Fund was credited for giving the film's crew production incentives. Production services throughout filming were provided by Czech Anglo Productions. Waititi-affiliated Defender Films and Piki Films were also credited as production companies.
Casting.
In 2018, casting associates were dispatched to schools in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Germany, the United States, and Canada to find the right actor to portray Jojo Betzler. Waititi wanted an actor "who could embody the character's pinwheeling mix of blind gusto and untamed emotions in stride", while also depicting Jojo's coming-of-age transformation in a way that blended well with the film's "deep" themes. Waititi and the casting team, led by casting director Des Hamilton, watched about 1,000 audition tapes, and later accepted Roman Griffin Davis, who was initially being auditioned for "Ford v Ferrari", but later also auditioned for "Jojo Rabbit". According to producer Carthew Neal, Davis had the charisma and enthusiasm Jojo's character projects, but was also able to mix a variety of emotions, further enriching the film's "deep" themes. Davis stated that portraying Jojo was a challenge as he is a conflicted character. He guided himself by researching the Hitler Youth. As a newcomer, he received immense support from the cast members. Davis joined the project six weeks before filming; he was one of the latest actors to be cast despite being in the lead role.
Waititi created Elsa Korr as a character with "the steely strength and self-possession that defuses Jojo's distrust", a mysterious yet humane outlook. Thomasin McKenzie, a New Zealand-born actress Waititi had known for a long time, was chosen to portray Elsa as a "really pretty, very cool girl who has this hard attitude", which hopefully would make Jojo's infatuation towards her in the film understandable. McKenzie did research on World War II from the perspective of a Jewish girl, and she created the character of Elsa by herself, with Waititi giving her only a teaser of how he imagined Elsa. Waititi also asked her to watch the film "Heathers" (1989), which has a character he envisioned Elsa to be.
In March 2018, it was revealed that Waititi would direct, write, co-produce, and co-star in the film as Adolf. Speaking of the context of the role, Waititi stated, "It's my version of [...] a lonely boy's best version of his hero, which is really his dad," referring to the fact that in the film, Jojo is desperate to join Hitler's ranks during World War II. Searchlight decided that they would only make the film if Waititi portrayed Adolf; Waititi reluctantly agreed and recalled being embarrassed on set. He also stated he did not do much research on Hitler "because I just didn't think he deserved [the effort]." The cast members recalled being shocked the first time they saw Waititi dressed as Adolf.
Also in March, Scarlett Johansson was cast as Rosie for what Waititi described as "this sort of goofy quality about her that I always really wanted to see in a film". Although the film's premise was new to her, Johansson stated that she immediately fell in love with the character. and said that the screenplay "has a lot of humanity." The following month, Sam Rockwell was cast as Captain Klenzendorf. He was "reticent" at the time, like most of the other actors, but he chose to join the project because he said the role "has a juxtaposition", specifically pointing at the Klenzendorf's homosexuality, which according to him is an oxymoron. Rockwell looked for inspiration from comedians like Bill Murray and Walter Matthau (from the 1976 film "The Bad News Bears"), as he felt they resembled his assigned character. He also looked to the film's other characters for inspiration.
In June 2018, Alfie Allen was cast as Klenzendorf's companion Freddy Finkel. Though Finkel was a new and risky role for Allen, the familial dynamic of the set made it easier for him. The same month, Stephen Merchant was cast as Captain Herman Deertz. He said that he became interested in the film due to its coming-of-age nature, and thought that Waititi's blend of humor and tragedy was seamless, comparing its satirical style with that of "Dr. Strangelove". Soon, Rebel Wilson joined the project as "Fräulein" Rahm.
Casting in Prague was led by Maya Kvetny, with Kristýna Poliček assisting. Additional casting was done by Shayna Markowitz, Stephanie Gorin, and Stu Turner. Casting for the extras were done by Deedee Casting Management; children extras were cast by A-Casting.
Filming.
"Jojo Rabbit" was credited as a co-production between the United States, New Zealand, and the Czech Republic.
Principal photography for the film occurred between May 28 and July 21, 2018, at various places in Prague, Žatec, Úštěk, Kytín, Dolní Beřkovice, Hořín, Lenešice, and the Petschek Palace. The former Lenešice sugar factory was used to film the war scenes. Production designer Ra Vincent chose these pre-war, unbombed places "because it had so much character and it felt like the most German of all the Czech towns we visited, with lots of German-style baroque architecture" The Barrandov Studios were also used for filming most of the interior scenes, which Vincent thought of as a great choice, considering Nazi propaganda used to be filmed there. Vincent chose Úštěk to film the exterior due to the "ornate" color palette of the architecture, said to connect with Jojo's character.
Waititi prohibited cell phone usage on set in order to retain focus and create a calming environment. He allowed the crew and actors to experiment with their work or characters by themselves, as he had no strict edicts for how the film should unfold. This was also stated to be a third reason for the cell phone prohibition. Other directors, including Quentin Tarantino, have used this rule before. By minimizing directions for the cast members, Waititi hoped to avoid stiff performances. He also did not show the full picture of Rosie when she was hanged, thinking it was unethical to showcase the deaths of family members.
Due to labor laws on child actors, the crew was only able to film eight or nine hours a day, causing stress for the adult actors as they would have to work with body doubles for certain periods of time. The actors described having a fun experience on set, saying Waititi was engaging to work with. McKenzie further elaborated that it was "easy-going and fun", as it allowed her to "explore the character and try different things". These, along with doing rehearsals, were part of an effort to make the child actors feel comfortable so they would act more naturally.
Reshoots were done starting in February 2019. They mainly focused on scenes set during winter.
Cinematography and visual effects.
Mihai Mălaimare Jr. was enlisted as the film's cinematographer while he was doing reshoots for "The Hate U Give" in Atlanta, and he joined the project five days later. He agreed to depict "Jojo Rabbit" in a colorful and vibrant way, a primary motif of the film, taking inspiration from several colorized documentaries. He also took inspiration from a film he had previously worked on, "Youth Without Youth" (2007), which featured colorful World War II footage, contrasting the typical desaturated and grayscale historical footage. "Cabaret" (1972) was also a visual reference used for the cinematography. Despite this, Mălaimare arranged for the melancholic scenes to look more desaturated, corresponding to Jojo's emotions and showing the passage of time. He and Waititi also agreed not to visually exaggerate scenes with Adolf. Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa's images of children during World War II also served as inspiration for the cinematography style: "They were still playing, and they were still doing normal kid stuff, [but] the closer you look at the photo, [...] you realize something is wrong—like, 'Oh, in this one, they are wearing gas masks,' or 'They are playing close to a pile of bomb'—all these situations that we felt were very close to ["Jojo Rabbit"]." Around 60 similar stills from Magnum Photos and Flickr were also printed to be analyzed for inspiration.
Mălaimare and Waititi also agreed on the decision not to use hand-held cameras, in order to retain the film's classical style. Equipped with a dolly (a golf cart for scenes in the forest), a 35mm Arri Alexa SXT with Super 35 format, supplemented with Hawk V-Lite 1.3x anamorphic lenses and Vantage One T1 spherical lenses, was used. Around five tests were implemented to determine the aspect ratio for the film. A anamorphic format was chosen, considering that there were lots of scenes with two people indoors. The anamorphic format was favored due to its "velvety" tone, focus breathing, as well as authentic bokeh. The 1.3x squeeze factor was combined with the SXT's 4x3 full image sensor to create 1:85:1 with anamorphic lenses. The stopped down T1 was used for scenes in small or low-light areas, in order to give them a wide feel. Mălaimare worked with digital imaging technician (DIT) Eli Berg to create seamless transitions between Hawk and Vantage scenes. Though point-of-view shots were sometimes used, the main approach in making the film from the eyes of Jojo is to lower the camera to Davis's height. Waititi allowed the actors to also give cinematography advice, some of which were better than Waititi's suggestions, according to Mălaimare himself. Symmetry and horizons are the main composition approaches to the cinematography, a major contributor to the narrative flow. The film was mostly shot using a multiple-camera setup so that close-up and wide shots could be done simultaneously.
Exterior scenes rarely used artificial lighting: scenes in the forest, for example, solely used the sun. The final sequence of the battle scene, which took five or six takes to accomplish, used an three lightings, but they were merely supplements to the sun. The scene where Jojo is having dinner with Rosie used an extensive lighting kit, mainly consisting of a chandelier and two lightings, lighting the entirety of the setting; one of them were replaced by dimmed, and tungsten lights to give the characters a softer and warmer lighting in the close-up shots. Small five-watt LED lights were used as lighting for the actors in scenes at Elsa's secret room. In that setting, Mălaimare decided to use a medium-bright petrol lamp as the key light, whereas a lighting was used to indicate dusk; candles act as supplements.
Amplifying the cinematography was visual effects supervisor Jason Chen, a previous collaborator of Waititi. He joined a project after working on "Bumblebee". The goal was to create a "seamless illusion", balancing realism and surrealism. In total, there were about 200 visual effects shots, "about half of which were big invisible set extensions and often done by a [...] team of in house compositors" led by previous Chen collaborator Kenneth Quinn Brown. Chen worked with Clear Angle Studios to set up 3D scanners on tripods at Žatec. The scanners shoot laser beams, rotating 360 degrees, scanning the surrounding architecture in order to give an accurate representation of them. They also scanned Czech streets with historical relevance to "Jojo Rabbit", especially the square used for Jojo's town, which was once a frequent place for Hitler to hold rallies. A major contributor to the visual effects was Luma Pictures (Brendan Seals was the Luma VFX supervisor), which split the work between Los Angeles and Melbourne. Luma used blue screens to incorporate elements like explosions, tanks, smoke, and gunfire in post-production. The glow of bombs going off in the distance, meanwhile, used matte paintings. They also incorporated snow into scenes that were actually shot during the summer, but were supposed to depict winter in "Jojo Rabbit"'s universe. This was achievable by photographing snow on the streets and adding it to the film, a technique known as "background plate." Additional effects were done by Picture Shop VFX. In total, visual effects took a year to finish.
Digital intermediate work, specifically color grading, was done by Company 3's senior colorist Tim Stipan.
Fashion design.
Mayes C. Rubeo, who had previously collaborated with Waititi in "Ragnarok", became "Jojo Rabbit"'s costume designer. In an "intensive" conversation about the costumes, Waititi favored "formal, elegant" fashion, as it matched the kind of clothing people wore in that era, according to his research. He also wanted a design that symbolized the joy of childhood: bright, vivid colors, stressing the ambition to contrast typical historical films. Rubeo interpreted these as Italian neorealism, a filmmaking style popular in the 1940s.
Rubeo thought of Rosie's character as open: "She represents [...] life, [and] she doesn't want to hide [that]." Rubeo started by scouring vintage Italian houses for Rosie's wardrobe, though she also created several blouses and dresses by herself. She wanted Rosie's clothing to be distinctive so it would resonate with the audience throughout the film and assist them in the scene where Rosie is found hanged. Concerning that specific scene, Rubeo chose a pair of single lace-up red and white spectator shoes made by the Toronto shoemaker Jitterbug, based on a sketch she made. Imagining Rosie as "the friend of Elsa Schiaparelli", Rubeo flew to New York City, where she discussed the costume with actor Johansson. Rosie's short-sleeved sweater was characterized by "plaid and zigzag Missoni-style patterns". She was completed with high-waist baggy pants and several other accessories, offering her character a "chic" look. This is in stark contrast to Elsa's clothing palette which, being a confined character, was made monochromatic.
Jojo's "Jungvolk" uniform was based on the assumption that he is "trying to be the policeman of his household", especially when he wears it even in his house. Though Rubeo found vintage "Jungvolk" uniforms in Berlin, she noted the need for more sizes for the extras, causing her and the clothing department to sew them, a total of 250, themselves. For Adolf, Rubeo chose the typical brown Nazi Party style, in order to highlight the absurdities of his character, though a "voluminous" pair of riding pants was used to highlight his imaginary state and insecurities. "The Hollywood Reporter" described it as "paper-bag colored", "khaki", and "safari-style". In total, three Adolf uniforms were sewed. Portraying Captain Klenzendorf, Rockwell reached out to Rubeo and showed her a photo of Murray on "Saturday Night Live", saying that he wanted such design. For an experimental uniform Klenzendorf was written to wear in the screenplay, Rubeo went for a "glitzier", "heroic", and "flamboyant" approach, creating for him an "unorthodox" outfit, showcasing the character's creativity despite "know[ing] almost nothing about the rules of design." She said that creating Klenzendorf's outfit "was fun to do".
Rubeo made six different versions for a paper uniform Yorki wears in the final battle scene. She made it out of paper and cardboard, with some cotton. As the war ensues, Yorki's uniform degrades, with only a vest left as the war concludes.
The film's make-up artist was Danelle Satherley, also a frequent collaborator of Waititi's. On Adolf's looks, she envisioned them to be those of a 10-year-old imagination and not an exact replica of Hitler's looks. Despite this, they had some similarities for familiarity purposes. The hair, mustache, and ears shared similarities with Hitler, whereas the skin and eyes had some alterations. Waititi's skin, specifically, was toned down a bit to not make his character look Caucasian. Blue eyes were chosen to match the propaganda Jojo saw.
Production design.
Vincent, who lived in New Zealand, was flabbergasted to be offered the role of the film's production designer, but he had read the script when it was still unproduced and already had some ideas for the set design. He stayed in the Czech Republic for some time to get a feel for European architecture, and took to locals who told generational stories about World War II in order to depict wartime Europe authentically, whilst giving aesthetic touches to symbolize the joy Jojo's character feels about Nazi Germany. Vincent recalled that the interaction with locals was easier than one might think because they see their Nazi history as something it is important to remember, not cover up. He also said that he thinks the locals might have even felt sad when the set decorations were torn away, since his team had "transformed the village back into its former glory days, when it was a beautifully unsullied town." Mălaimare commented that the practice in the Czech Republic of being very cautious about installing air conditioners and antennas on historical buildings – things that would have ruined the historical look of the film – allowed for a 360-degree set without having to remove much other than cars and street signs. Helping the research were military advisors and specialists; Filip Stiebitz was officially credited as one.
The fully handcrafted set design for the Betzler's house, a Baroque stone cottage filmed at a Barrandov Studios soundstage, is characterized by elegant details, such as thick door frames, windows recessed deeply into the stone walls, a wood-paneled hallway, and a curved staircase. Broadly, it features Art Deco architecture popular in the 1930s. Victorian architecture and a muted color palette were used for Inge's bedroom in order to provide a neutral space in which Jojo and Elsa could bond. According to Vincent's research, Inge's bedroom being in the attic is historically accurate, because certain families in World War II had new types of insulation replacing the method of pitched roofs, meaning they could build rooms up to the attic. This makes Elsa's hideout "obvious, but not-so-obvious". It is conceptualized that the Betzlers are a middle-class family, wealthy enough to own a two-floored, three-bedroom house. With a more modernized interior, another notion is also formed that the house was at some point renovated. Creating the house was said to be the trickiest thing throughout the film's production design. To not make it claustrophobic, the house was given an open layout plan, "and one with viewing portals through to other spaces so that you never felt like you were going to individual little sets. We wanted you to feel you were journeying through a proper house." The house was built on a stage to allow for adequate space to film using a multi-camera setup.
According to Vincent, a woman named Cheng Liang, who was the film's art department assistant, drew "Yoohoo Jew". She took inspiration from some of the artwork from the screenplay, as well as Waititi and Vincent's descriptions. Though the book was planned to be about 12 pages long, Liang ended up drawing 42 pages. Her drawings also became inspirations for the cast's acting style, according to Vincent.
Editing.
Editor Tom Eagles said that Waititi had been talking to him about the project "for a long time", though he read the screenplay much later. He recalled that Waititi did not sit by his side to judge his editing while it was ongoing. "He's interested in what you have to say and what you might bring to the edit," Eagles said. Eagles was given two weeks to edit "Jojo Rabbit" after being given some initial suggestions, which Eagles "cautiously" implemented. The film was edited using Avid Media Composer. Eagles used ScriptSync to compare scenes with the screenplay. He stated that the main challenge in editing the film was to give it a tonal balance for every transition between scenes: The rough cut was 165 minutes, with the director's cut being the finalized, 108-minute version. Eagles said that "We didn't want it to look like "Titanic"". Trimming took eight months, with test screenings implemented: "We needed to test different versions of things and iterations of jokes." It was also observed that some audiences were shocked by a scene when Hitler is scolding Jojo over his degrading patriotism; one person began quietly reciting a prayer. Dailies were also screened to the entire film team once or twice a week in a "small" screening room to let everyone judge the film's qualities, something said to be rare in modern filmmaking.
The film's title sequence was created by the New Zealand production company Assembly. It features footage from the 1935 Nazi propaganda documentary "Triumph of the Will". The text letterforms were handcrafted to correspond to the film's historical aesthetic. The film's end titles were created by Scarlet Letters.
Singaporean Ai-Ling Lee was the film's sound editor, designer, and mixer. With the digital audio workstation (DAW) Pro Tools, she used "subliminal sonic enhancements" to strengthen the sense that the film was portraying Jojo's point of view. In an interview with "Variety", she referenced a scene in Jojo's kitchen where Waititi wanted to evoke the sound of Adolf rallying. To increase the tension in the scene, she added reverb to Adolf's dialogue. Accompanying Lee as sound editor was Tobias Poppe. Paul Apelgren was the film's music editor. Steve Baine of Foley One was the Foley artist, with Peter Persaud and Gina Wark mixing and assisting with the Foley, respectively. Bob Industries was credited for post-production services.
Music.
Waititi enlisted Academy Award-winning composer Michael Giacchino to score the film. Giacchino recalled Waititi saying, "Do you remember what you did for "Up"? Just do that", pointing to that score's fairy tale-like melody, naturally evoking themes of love and loss. Contrary to what he usually does, Giacchino read the screenplay and discussed the tone of the score with Waititi, who said that he did not need a comical tone, as the film itself is already comical. Giacchino pledged to use music to emphasize the film's deep emotions instead of its humor, in order to retain the film's message, and to try to musicalize Nazi Germany from Jojo's perspective; he recalled this being a challenge. When asking himself "What feeling do you want people to walk away with from this movie?", Giacchino answered to himself: "Jojo going from a closed-off, blinders-on attitude about the world to having his worldview smashed open to starting to see everything in a very different way."
Immediately after seeing the film, Giacchino went back to his house and created an 11-minute suite "that showed the course of [Jojo's] character." This would later become the film's theme music. The main melody of the suite is played throughout the film in various different styles, ranging from marches (happy) to adagios (melancholic), which adapt to the emotion embodying each specific scene. The first version features a German children's choir singing lyrics written by Elyssa Samsel and translated by Dirk Richard Heidinger that, when translated, praise Nazism and fascism; Giacchino hoped that by the end of the film the feeling of the lyrics would get to the audience. Caludia Vašeková coordinated the choir, and music preparation was done by Jill Streater and Global Music Services. The vocals, done by Trinity Boys Choir, were contracted by Susie Gillis for Isobel Griffiths Ltd. The choirs were recorded in December 2018 at Abbey Road Studios, London. Freddie Jamison, part of Trinity Boys, was the vocal soloist in another version of the suite. Adult vocalists were from London Voices.
In the other tracks, Giacchino found inspiration in old-time European classical music, such as that of Frédéric Chopin, Franz Liszt, and Erik Satie. Following the suite, he composed for a 22-piece orchestra with a string quartet at its center, as well as piano, a couple of guitars, some brass and percussion. Though Giacchino often composes for a 100-piece orchestra, he felt that, for "Jojo Rabbit", "the smaller the orchestra, the more emotional the sound." Giacchino experimented with guitars in various tracks, such as "Jojo's Infirmary Period", which is played when Jojo is being hospitalized after being blasted by a "Stielhandgranate". Harps were also used in some melancholic tracks, such as "Beyond Questions" (played when Rosie visits Elsa in the attic) and "The Kids Are All Reich" (played when Jojo reflects on his ideology when witnessing war violence). The latter was described by Giacchino as "an elegy". Waititi responded positively to Giacchino's score, thinking that it "elevated the film to a new level, increasing the emotional resonance and tying the themes, characters and world of the movie together."
Incorporated music in the film was packaged as a soundtrack album, notably "Helden", the German version of "Heroes" by David Bowie, and "Komm, gib mir deine Hand", the German version of "I Want to Hold Your Hand" by the Beatles. While watching documentaries on the Hitler Youth during research, Waititi noted "similarities between the crowd at Hitler's rallies and the frenzy at Beatles concerts". Giacchino helped secure the rights to the song by contacting Paul McCartney, with whom he had previously worked. Other songs included in the film include "Tabú" (Lecuona Cuban Boys), "The Dipsy Doodle" (Ella Fitzgerald), "I Don't Wanna Grow Up" (Tom Waits), "Everybody's Gotta Live" (Love), "Mama" (Roy Orbison), "Waltz And Chorus From "Faust"" (Roger Wagner Chorale), and "Frühlingsstimmen" (Johann Strauss II). Both this soundtrack and the original score soundtrack were released on October 18, 2019, the day of "Jojo Rabbit"'s theatrical release, by Hollywood Records, Fox Music, and Universal Music Canada, with the vinyl version of the soundtrack released on December 6.
Themes and analysis.
Waititi described the moral of "Jojo Rabbit" as "about learning to think for yourself and not falling into the trap of just following the group".
The dominant theme of the film is Nazism. According to GradeSaver, a study guide, the film uses humor to increase the stakes of the regime's impact on the characters and their freedom. Specifically in Jojo, whose loyalty towards Nazism shifts throughout the film due to a clash with innocence, the film also shows the dangers of propaganda to those who blindly abide by it, especially children. Then, the film focuses on the individual characters and their traits, highlighting their bravery and strength to show "how strong they were even in the face of horror"; this is most distinct in Elsa's character, who has been compared to Anne Frank. Thus, the film centers upon the concept of how ideologies can affect people and society. It is also a message that fascist groups like the Nazis are harmful to everyone, supporters and opposition. It also sends a message that war takes joy away from people and is "painstakingly ugly"; the "Annals of the Romanian Society for Cell Biology" described it as "a moral to the present uncertainties in the modern world."
Hegemonic and toxic masculinity are also themes expressed in "Jojo Rabbit". The main example lies in Jojo's desire to be a Nazi, which to do so he was taught to act fierce. It also shows how such mentality harms everyone, men and women. Jojo's clumsy attitude as seen throughout the film shows how he is inherently incompatible with the ideology. This also allows the other characters as well as the audiences who "eventually overlook his avowed Nazism and instead view him as a sympathetic, misguided character who should be allowed redemption." Adolf's buffoonish attitude is a way of showcasing how hegemonic masculinity can attack itself subversively. There's also the suggestion that "Komm, gib mir deine Hand" is used to compare the obsessive behavior of the Beatles' fans (Beatlemania) to that of the prejudicial behavior of the Nazis.
Irony runs throughout the film. In the opening scene, Jojo motivates himself to be "a man", yet nervous. According to Tony S.L. Michael of the "Journal of Religion and Film", the way Falkenheim literature is German but the character dialogues are mostly English "sets up the dichotomy between the fact that what is outside may separate us, but what is inside should bring us altogether." This leads to another suggested theme of the film: human interaction. For example, as Elsa and Rosie began stressing to Jojo the importance of love and compassion in various dialogues, his viewpoint of Nazism begin to subtly shift, shown by the darkening attitude of Adolf. Klenzendorf's character, meanwhile, most embodies the film's use of hyperbole and sarcasm—seen in his distinct use of dry humor—which makes him important to the over-the-top portrayals of Nazism.
Psychoanalysis has been done on "Jojo Rabbit". Jojo, with his ideology, uses his psyche to create the character of Adolf. He never loses faith in him despite the many failures he had resulted in. Because of his indoctrinated nature, his prejudicial actions cannot be condemned. Eye-opening dialogues with Elsa and the discovery of Rosie's death culminates into an emotion expressed by kicking Adolf out of the window, erasing his ideology from his life. During this point, his ego has developed that he can differentiate good and bad, and be independent. Thus, the film's plot is said to be on par with Sigmund Freud's child psychoanalysis theory. Sociology author Eugene Nulman also observed that, in the film, Rosie and Elsa lie to preserve their psyche-self while Jojo lies to preserve his ego-self.
A main motif of "Jojo Rabbit" is shoes. They feature frequently in the film, either visually or audibly. According to Michael, it is a metaphor symbolizing Jojo's coming-of-age journey. During the scene where Jojo finds Rosie hanged, it suggests to Jojo that he should become more mature. Other motifs include the rabbit, symbolizing Jojo's inability to live up with the Nazi's expectations, and the dagger, symbolizing toxic masculinity. Meanwhile, dancing represents "pleasure in the face of adversity, relief when it is over, and hope for the future", as well as freedom. Nulman compares this to the misquoted phrase by Emma Goldman, "If I can't dance, it's not my revolution."
Marketing and release.
In March 2019, distributor Fox Searchlight's parent company 21st Century Fox was acquired by Disney. As "Jojo Rabbit" featured mature themes, several Disney executives worried that releasing the film would ruin their reputation as a family-friendly studio; it was also said to be "too edgy" for Disney, as stated in "Variety". However, they remained optimistic about the film's success, with CEOs Bob Iger and Alan Horn arguing that it has a good message and would diversify their scope.
To market the film, Fox Searchlight released a scene from the German World War II film "Downfall", which had been a popular asset for memes, wherein subtitles would mistranslate the dialogue to something humorous, mostly known as the Angry Hitler meme. In the "Jojo Rabbit" version, Hitler is driven insane with the news of Waititi, a Polynesian Jew, creating a film poking fun at Hitler. Additionally, a teaser was released on July 24, 2019, and a trailer was released on September 3, 2019. Smith Brothers Media was in charge of making visual advertisements, including posters and web banners, primarily for Australia. Due to the film's quirky nature, a "vibrant" theme was chosen to "make the character images 'pop' for potential audiences." The poster was unveiled on September 5.
"Jojo Rabbit" had its world premiere at the 44th Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2019. It also screened at festivals at Austin, San Diego, Chicago, Philadelphia, Hawaii, New Orleans, Chapel Hill, Middleburg, Tokyo, and the United Kingdom. It was also the closing film for the 30th Stockholm International Film Festival on November 16, 2019, which was also the film's Nordic premiere. The film was theatrically released in the United States on October 18, 2019, opening in several cities before expanding in the following weeks. By November 8, 2019, it was playing in 798 theaters in the U.S. "Jojo Rabbit" was released in New Zealand on 24 October 2019. In other countries, it was released within the vicinity of January and February 2020. In the United States, it remained in theaters for around 70 weeks and was last screened on March 19, 2020. A scheduled theatrical release of "Jojo Rabbit" in China of February 12, 2020 was confirmed, following restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, to be postponed, alongside various other films by the National Arthouse Alliance of Cinemas (the film's distributor). It later saw a limited release from July 31 to August 27, 2020.
20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film as a digital download on February 4, 2020, and on DVD and Blu-ray disc formats in the United States on February 18. In international territories, the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment. The Blu-ray release contains several special features, including three deleted scenes ("Imaginary Göring", "Little Piggies", "Adolf Dies Again"), outtakes, a featurette titled "Inside "Jojo Rabbit"", an audio commentary, and two of the film's trailers. The film was later released on Hotstar, HBO Max, Sky Cinema, Now TV, and Hulu. It also airs on various HBO networks and was released on Disney+'s Star sub-brand on February 23, 2021.

Critical response.
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 80% with an average score of 7.60/10, based on 421 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Jojo Rabbit"s blend of irreverent humor and serious ideas definitely won't be to everyone's taste—but either way, this anti-hate satire is audacious to a fault." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 58 out of 100 based on 57 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, and those at PostTrak gave the film a 96% overall positive score, with 87% saying they would definitely recommend it.
Brian Truitt, writing for "USA Today" called it "brilliant Nazi-mocking satire", praising the performances, and writing: "As much as it makes you laugh, Waititi's must-watch effort is a warm hug of a movie that just so happens to have a lot of important things to say." In a positive review, Steve Pond of "TheWrap" wrote that "there's real heart in "Jojo Rabbit", too. This is a dark satire that finds a way to make a case for understanding. As circumstances slowly chip away at Jojo's hate-driven worldview, the black comedy finds room for some genuinely touching moments."
Richard Roeper of the "Chicago Sun-Times" lauded it as "uncomfortably funny, unapologetically insensitive, cheerfully outrageous" and concluding that writer-director Waititi "delivers a timely, anti-hate fractured fairy tale." In another positive review, Stephanie Zacharek of "Time" wrote: "It's Waititi's ability to balance unassailable goofy moments with an acknowledgment of real-life horrors that makes the movie exceptional." Adam Graham of "The Detroit News" called it an "enchanting, whimsical satire about the absurdity of war as seen through a child's eyes" as well as "a smart, accessible, inclusive film that opens doors at a time when many are slamming them shut."
"Variety"s Owen Gleiberman said that the film "creates the illusion of danger while playing it safe" and wrote that "it lacks the courage of its own conventionality. It's a feel-good movie, all right, but one that uses the fake danger of defanged black comedy to leave us feeling good about the fact that we're above a feel-good movie." Eric Kohn of IndieWire wrote that "Despite a few flashes of tragedy, "Jojo Rabbit" lingers in a charming muddle of good vibes without really confronting their implications. [Waititi] may be one of the few working directors capable of injecting quirky scenarios with real depth, but in this case, he reduces the underlying circumstances—you know, that Holocaust thing—to a superficial prop."
A. O. Scott of "The New York Times" wrote that "The particulars of the evil can seem curiously abstract, and the portrayal of goodness can feel a bit false, and forced" and that "Elsa's Jewishness has no real content. She exists mainly as a teaching moment for Johannes. Her plight is a chance for him to prove his bravery." Keith Uhlich of "Slant Magazine" criticized the film's premise, lack of historical accuracy and realism, and use of anti-semitic canards and stereotypes, and wrote that Waititi's performance as Hitler is "aiming for "The Great Dictator" but barely hitting ""." "Little White Lies" Hannah Woodhead criticized the film for its inclusion of a sympathetic Nazi character, Captain Klenzendorf, writing that it "feels oddly impartial, keen to note that actually, there were some Nice Nazis Too. That's not really something we need to hear in 2019, with white nationalism back in vogue and on the march across much of western civilisation."
The film received a negative critical reception in the UK, with Robbie Collin saying that he was "aghast": the scenes at the camp were "the laziest rip-off of "Moonrise Kingdom" I've seen in my life", and "there's no sense that anything is at stake [...] it sentimentalises and trivialises the Holocaust [...] the stuff that JoJo is indoctrinated with is made up of old "Borat" lines, and that's not what anti-Semitism is." Peter Bradshaw agreed: "There are no insights to be had – and no laughs", and calling it "strangely redundant". Mark Kermode was slightly more positive, but still said that it was "neither sharp enough nor funny enough to cut to the heart of its subject matter."
Historical accuracy.
Despite being a loose depiction of World War II, "Jojo Rabbit" accurately depicts various aspects of the era. Boys in the Hitler Youth did spread propaganda and collect scraps like Jojo does, and "Stielhandgranaten" were popularized during World War II. Several mentions of the Axis powers are also said to be accurate, although the film fictionalized a convergence of American and Soviet soldiers in the same battle. The "free Germany" sign style used in the film is also fictional, though other styles were present.
Bundling various historical sources, "Time" thinks the film depicted the Nazi regime, as seen from a child's perspective, accurately. Many "Jungvolk" children recalled the experience as being fun and looked upon the regime from an innocent perspective. A memoir by former member Alfons Heck described the program as "an exciting life, free from parental supervision, filled with 'duties' that seemed sheer pleasure." Though female members did not do many physical activities, as seen in the film, they were given traditionally feminine duties, such as farming, cooking, cleaning, singing, swimming, gymnastics, and running, which had the purpose of keeping their bodies fit so they could find a husband and spread the Nazi ideology to their future children.
"Jojo Rabbit" divided experts of the Holocaust at a panel discussion following a screening at the Museum of Tolerance. Rick Trank, producer of "The Long Way Home", felt that, while it has a creative premise, the lack of historical context makes the film detrimental to young viewers, who may misunderstand the premise and think the film's farcical elements are depicting historical reality. However, Claudia Wiedeman, director of education at the USC Shoah Foundation, said that, with the right educational methods and tools, the film could be a useful resource for young people who are learning about World War II. Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate &amp; Extremism and professor of criminal justice at California State University, San Bernardino, applauded the film for using sarcasm—an easy-to-understand modern language—to depict Nazi Germany.
"Jojo Rabbit" had an impact on teaching of the Holocaust on December 19, 2019, when the USC Shoah Foundation announced it worked together with Searchlight to develop a classroom curriculum regarding the depiction of Nazism in the film. According to the Foundation, it "demonstrates how individuals can overcome ingrained prejudices and hate" and significantly expands their catalog of Holocaust scholarly resources. This curriculum was combined with Holocaust survivors testimony videos from their Visual History Archive (VHA). These are all bundled into a landing page at the Foundation's IWitness website.
Accolades.
"Jojo Rabbit" and its cast and crew won 14 awards. Including the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay that was won by Waititi, the film received a total of six nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards, including Best Supporting Actress for Johansson and Best Picture. Newcomer Davis received various accolades, including a nomination for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at the 77th Golden Globe Awards and a win as Best Young Performer at the 25th Critics' Choice Awards, a category in which McKenzie and Yates were also nominated. At the Costume Designers Guild Awards 2019, Rubeo won the award for Excellence in Period Film; at the Academy Awards, she was nominated for Best Costume Design. Eagles, Vincent, and set decorator Nora Sopková also received Academy Award nominations. "Jojo Rabbit" was chosen by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute as one of the ten best films of 2019.

Triisopropyl silane (TIPS) is an organosilicon compound with the formula ("i"-Pr)3SiH ("i"-Pr = isopropyl). This colorless liquid is used as a scavenger in peptide synthesis. It can also act as a mild reducing agent.
In peptide synthesis, TIPS is used as a scavenger for peptide groups being removed from the peptide sequence at the global deprotection. TIPS is able to scavenge carbocations formed in the deprotection of a peptide as it can act as a hydride donor in acidic conditions. Silanes may be preferred as scavengers in place of sulfur-based scavengers.

Dead Hand (The Americans)

"Dead Hand" is the sixth season premiere of the American television drama series "The Americans", and the 66th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on March 28, 2018 in the United States on FX.
Plot.
In the three years between 1984 and 1987, Philip has become a full-time travel agent running an expanded Dupont Circle Travel, Henry attends boarding school and plays hockey, and Paige attends George Washington University in D.C. and is a Soviet agent in training (and also is practicing Russian by watching a Soviet movie with Elizabeth and Claudia). Stan has married Renee and has moved out of FBI counterintelligence except for the now-married Sofia and Gennadi (whom he still handles with his ex-partner Dennis Aderholt, the new head of counterintelligence), while Elizabeth is exhausted and resentful from handling a full KGB case load nine weeks before the Reagan-Gorbachev summit in D.C. (December 8–10, 1987), with most of her work focused on the summit. 
Claudia informs Elizabeth that she has been ordered by certain unknown parties in the Center to travel to Mexico City and meet with General Kovtun of the Soviet Strategic Rocket Forces, who tells her about "Dead Hand" (a doomsday device) and the Soviet military's plan to overthrow Gorbachev if he renounces it. Kovtun asks Elizabeth to spy on Soviet negotiator Fyodor Nesterenko, who is meeting with American negotiator Glenn Haskard (whom Elizabeth is monitoring as "Stephanie", a home health care aide for his wife Erica, a terminally ill artist). Kovtun also gives Elizabeth a cyanide pill to take if captured. 
Meanwhile in the USSR, Arkady, now deputy chief of Directorate S and a Gorbachev supporter, recruits Oleg, now married (with a son) and out of the KGB (but also a Gorbachev supporter), to travel to the US and ask Philip to uncover (and possibly stop) Elizabeth's unapproved new mission; due to internal Soviet opposition to Gorbachev within the Center, Arkady cannot trust his own officers with this task. After arriving in D.C., Oleg signals Philip and then meets with him, telling Philip that he will stay in D.C. (without official cover) to await Philip's answer. 
While Paige is on a surveillance detail, a young U.S. security officer tries to coerce her for a date by taking her (fake) college ID. Elizabeth then kills him and recovers the ID. That night, when Philip tries to tell Elizabeth about Oleg's visit and points out the emotional toll of her job, she rudely dismisses him.
Production.
The episode was written by Joel Fields and series creator Joe Weisberg and directed by Chris Long. The Soviet movie watched by Paige, Elizabeth, and Claudia in the episode was the 1980 Academy Award winner for Best Foreign Language Film, "Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears".
Reception.
In its original American broadcast, "Dead Hand" was seen by an estimated 642,000 household viewers and gained a 0.14 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research.
"Dead Hand" received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has a 100% approval rating with an average score of 9.8 out of 10 based on 14 reviews, with the consensus stating: "Tensions mount in 'Dead Hand,' an unusually fast-paced installment that barrels toward the show's seemingly inevitable endgame." "The A.V. Club" gave the episode a perfect A grade. Alan Sepinwall from Uproxx reviewed it positively saying, "'Dead Hand' wastes little time in establishing just how bad the conclusion could be for all involved."

The Sacrament of Sin

The Sacrament of Sin is the seventh studio album by German power metal band Powerwolf, released on 20 July 2018 by Napalm Records. The band wrote it during 2017 and began recording it in January 2018 at the Fascination Street Studios in Örebro, Sweden. It was Jens Bogren's first production work for Powerwolf. Joost van den Broek assisted the band with orchestras. Musically, the album is much more different than previous recordings. The expression of the organ has changed, the orchestra has been added and unusual elements such as bagpipes or flute and the band recorded a ballad accompanied by the piano for the first time in its history. The main theme of the album from the point of view of lyrics is sin, but it is not a concept album.
The album was rated positively by the critics, highlighting mainly the new elements that Powerwolf put in the music. The album also flourished commercially, ranked first in the German charts, and also ranked in several other countries. In support of the album, the band performed in Europe during 2018 and 2019.
Official videos were released for "Demons Are a Girl's Best Friend", "Fire &amp; Forgive", "Incense &amp; Iron", "Killers with the Cross", "The Sacrament of Sin", "Stossgebet", "Where the Wild Wolves Have Gone" and "Nightside of Siberia".
On 14 September 2018, the album won a German Metal Hammer Award for Best Album.
A limited edition mediabook version also features a second disc named "Communio Lupatum", which features Powerwolf songs covered by other artists selected by the band members.
Background.
Powerwolf began working on the seventh studio album after the European tour, which took place in the winter of 2017 until October of the same year. The musical expression of the songs was influenced by the CD "Metallum Nostrum", on which the band recorded cover versions of songs by various artists and which was released as a bonus to the previous album "Blessed &amp; Possessed" (2015). This, according to guitarist Matthew Greywolf, showed the band that "they can play a lot more variations than they did in the past, and it will still sound like Powerwolf." For example, for the first time in history, bagpipes or flute were introduced to the Powerwolf music, a much wider index was used for the organ, and the band also recorded a piano-ballad for the first time in their career. Another major influence on the sound of the album was the replacement of the producer with Jens Bogren.
They began recording the album in January 2018 at the Swedish Fascination Street Studios in Örebro, and the process lasted until March of the same year. The band decided to change the production team because they did not want to stagnate in one place but wanted to move musically. All six of the band's previous albums were recorded with Fredrik Nordström. The collaboration with Bogren was preceded by a discussion of the band's sound, which, according to Greywolf, also helped the group understand themselves. According to Falk Maria Schlegel, the new production benefited the songs, as many instruments were recorded in the studio in one piece, not in parts. As a result, the songs "breathe more". Some of the compositions also feature a large number of orchestrations by Bogren and Joost van den Broek.
The theme of sin appears in some of the songs that deal with "what sin is and how man becomes a sinner." Before the album was released, the group released four singles; "Demons Are a Girl's Best Friend,": Midnight Madonna", "Fire &amp; Forgive", and "Incense &amp; Iron." All of them were first released only in digital form, the first of them later also physically as a special edition available only at the Czech Masters of Rock festival. In this way, the band wanted to thank Czech fans for the gold record they had received for "Blessed &amp; Possessed".
Composition.
The album features the fast track "Fire &amp; Forgive," which was also released as a single. The text deals with forgiveness. It is followed by the first single, “Demons Are a Girl's Best Friend,” which gives preference to organs. The song is textually concerned with temptation and sin. While the first two songs are played by the classic Powerwolf style, the third "Killers with the Cross" is more glorious and Sabaton-like. The text tells of hunting vampires. Positively tuned is also another song "Incense &amp; Iron", which unusually presents bagpipes. This song was released as the third single. This is followed by "Where the Wild Wolves Have Gone", the first ballad in the band's history. While the chorus is accompanied by orchestral elements in addition to guitars; strings and breaths, individual stanzas have piano accompaniment. The first half of the album ends with the song "Stossgebet", which is the second in the history of the band sung in German. The title could be translated into English as "short prayer" and it is in this song that Bogren's work is evident, especially the combination of guitars, strings and organs.
The other half of the album continues with "Nightside of Siberia", which is built on similar guitar riffs to Amon Amarth. Another song is the title "The Sacrament of Sin", which, like the opening "Fire &amp; Forgive", is played in a typical Powerwolf style. The eighth "Venom of Venus" begins with Attila Dorn's classic vocals and is accompanied by speed changes; while the chorus is played faster, the individual stanzas are rather slow. "Nighttime Rebel", the slowest song on the album, features an organ, but guitars are also preferred. In previous albums Powerwolf usually ended with a slower and longer song, but for The Sacrament of Sin they chose the fast and short "Fist by Fist (Sacralize or Strike)" as the final track.
Release.
The album was released on 20 July 2018 via Napalm Records. In addition to the basic edition featuring CDs with songs from "The Sacrament of Sin", an extended version has also been released with the bonus album "Communio Lupatum", featuring remodeled Powerwolf songs by various other artists selected by the band members. These two albums were also released in a limited "Priest Edition" containing in addition to orchestral versions of songs also various complementary gifts, such as a cross or a scarf. In the orders via Napalm Records and the EMP Merchandising music store, the song "Midnight Madonna" was added as a bonus.
The cover of the album was made by the artist Zsofia Danková from Slovakia. The cover depicts a hooded wolf holding a priest and a devil as puppets. According to Matthew Greywolf, this shows that "the role of evil and goodness can be attributed to individual figures with something greater that has the power to control them." After the release of the cover, the Internet began to discuss a possible allusion to the cover of the album "The Number of the Beast" by Iron Maiden released in 1982, on which the band's mascot Eddie holds the puppet of the devil. According to Danková and Greywolf, this is only a coincidence.
Promotion.
Wolfsnächte Tour 2018.
The band announced their tour supporting "The Sacrament of Sin" on YouTube on 27 February 2018. Amaranthe and Kissin' Dynamite were selected to serve a series of opening acts for Powerwolf during the tour. The tour was set to begin on 25 October 2018 at the Bataclan theathre in Paris, France. It was set to end on 17 November 2018 at the Saarlandhalle in the band's hometown Saarbrücken.
The Sacrament of Sin Tour 2019.
Their second tour associated with the album was set to begin on 8 November 2019 in Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg and was set to end on 7 December 2019 in Bern, Switzerland. This time, Gloryhammer was selected to serve a series of opening acts for Powerwolf.
Critical reception.
The Metal Hammer noticed "fine details that complement the sound but perfectly match the given idiosyncrasies" and asked "how much change a band would make with such well-defined trademarks. Behind the eternal accusation hides the highest art: Powerwolf develop so inconspicuously in small steps and subtle nuances that it seems as if they have not changed anything, but “just” delivered another great album". Metal.de stated that the band was "mostly faithful to their long-established style", and concluded: "Powerwolf prove with "The Sacrament of Sin" that they have not lost any of their untameable passion over the years. Album number seven offers eleven sinfully beautiful hymns to all power metal apostles, who sometimes provide with a lot of emotion, sometimes with relentless speed for a varied heavy metal worship".
David Havlena, editor of the Czech magazine Spark, wrote that ""The Sacrament of Sin" is an album of many faces". He pointed out that it would not hurt if Powerwolf involved more creativity in their work. In the case of "The Sacrament of Sin", according to Havlena, they have fulfilled the potential of "about fifty percent". Havlena's colleague Robert Čapek highlighted the ballad "Where the Wild Wolves Have Gone", which, according to him, looks on the album from the perspective of emotions "real". Havlena rated the album with five stars out of six, and Čapek gave half a star more. In the rating of all Spark editors, the album got 4.3 points and placed third in the July album ranking. According to reviewer Mattie Jensen of Metal Wani, "The Sacrament of Sin" is "exactly what you can expect from Powerwolf, and it's not a bad thing at all." Jensen gave the album 8.8 out of ten.
Controversies.
The music video for "Fire &amp; Forgive" was recorded in the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene in Ścinawka Średnia, Poland. After releasing it on YouTube on 22 June 2018, Powerwolf was accused by the local curia of Świdnica that the video "overstepped limits with regard both to the sacredness of the church as well as to the trust shown by the parish priest in charge of that holy place".
Many Polish newspapers wrote about this controversy. Most of them said that the band is satanic and anti-church.

Mary Imrie

Mary Imrie (August 29, 1918 – April 11, 1988) was a Canadian architect. She was one of the first women in Canada to establish an architectural firm. She is also considered to be Edmonton's first female architect.
Biography.
Born in Toronto, Ontario to a well-to-do family, Imrie's parents moved to Edmonton, Alberta when she was three years old. Her father was John M. Imrie, an Edmonton newspaper publisher who won a Pulitzer prize. She first studied architecture at the University of Alberta and then at the University of Toronto, studying under Eric Arthur and graduating in 1944. From 1946-1949, she worked for the city of Edmonton as a draftsman, along with her future partner Jean Wallbridge. While there, the municipality sent both of them to Europe to study post-war reconstruction methods.
In 1950, Imrie and Wallbridge formed a business partnership in Edmonton, working together until 1979, the time of Wallbridge's death. They built mostly homes that were known for their elegant yet modern lines. They were also able to procure several commercial contracts, such as elementary schools and housing for senior citizens. 
In 1957, their firm won a Canadian Housing Design Council award. Despite the high caliber of their work, as female architects they had a harder time obtaining larger commissions. Women in that era were often regulated to the less lucrative residential or interior design markets. Imrie and Wallbridge also traveled extensively, visiting several continents, and writing about their experiences for a journal owned by the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada.
Concerning her professional work, Imbrie stated, "It was a grind, in a cold hard world. But I would like to add, it was also satisfying and a lot of fun!" She was a member of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada and the Alberta Association of Architects. A travel grant is named after her at The University of Alberta, called the "Mary Louise Imrie Graduate Student Award". Interested by Alberta's natural landscapes, Imrie bequeathed the bulk of her estate to the Parks Venture Fund of Alberta. She donated her home, the "Imirie House", as well as the land located next to the North Saskatchewan River.

Kellermann was born in Paris and was studying at the University of Clermont-Ferrand when she left her studies to join the Resistance in 1942. She married Ernst Kellermann (normally known as Walter) (1915–2012), a German Jew whom she met in Paris. Walter became an academic in the UK, where the couple made their home. They had a son and two daughters, one of whom is the actress Barbara Kellerman.
Marcelle Kellermann became a teacher of modern languages in Leeds and at Bingley College of Education in Yorkshire. Her articles on the subject of language teaching included "Two experiments on language teaching in primary schools in Leeds", published by the Nuffield Foundation in 1964. Her monograph in Pergamon Press's Language Teaching Methodology series, "The Forgotten Third Skill: Reading a Foreign Language", was published in 1981. She was said to have "pioneered the teaching of French to primary school children".
Later, the couple retired to London, and she wrote a book about her wartime experiences, "A Packhorse Called Rachel", published in 2007 by Grosvenor House. "The Interpreter", published by CreateSpace in 2014, resulted from her research into the activities of a Nazi officer, "Frank von Heugen", who used his language skills to become an Allied informer.

Falcon Records (Texas)

Falcon Records was a record label from McAllen, Texas, that was instrumental in the establishment of tejano as a widespread musical style. Founded in 1948 by Arnaldo Ramirez, the label specialized in the rural "norteño" music which had been abandoned by the major labels. By the early 1960s it was clearly the leading tejano music label. Falcon was responsible for numerous recordings by Los Alegres de Terán, Chelo Silva, René y René, Roberto Pulido, and many other tejano and norteño artists of significance. Falcon's product gained international exposure through the syndicated television program "Fanfarria Falcon." The label's activities wound down around 1990, and the recordings were purchased by EMI. The company's historical artifacts are held at the Jernigan Library at Texas A&amp;M University–Kingsville.
History.
Falcon's founder Arnaldo Ramirez (1918–1993) became interested in the entertainment industry at an early age. He learned to become a master of ceremonies, and was a radio DJ in Harlingen, Texas, by the early 1940s. He concentrated on Spanish music, buying radio hours on stations in such towns as McAllen, Texas, and Reynosa, Mexico. He then subcontracted some of his radio time to other disc jockeys, and eventually acquired funds enough to open his own recording studio.
When his main station, XWAW, ceased operations as a border blaster, Ramirez came to realize there was a sizable audience for the music he was promoting. He set up a recording studio in McAllen, Texas, which was just a few miles from the Mexican border. Early recordings were often interrupted by traffic noise. Ramirez found this necessary as major labels such as RCA Victor, who had previously released numerous recording catering to the Chicano audience, left the genre as a result of World War II shellac rationing and did not resume recording regional music, concentrating instead on larger Hispanic markets in major metropolitan areas such as Mexico City. Ramirez's first record label was Mira, started in 1947 which specialized in Afro-Cuban music. The label started a "Mexican Series" featuring Pedro Ayala. The next year, 1948, Ramirez started Falcon records which featured Tejano culture.
Falcon was dedicated to producing Spanish music, and in particular conjunto Tex-Mex music. Falcon concentrated artists from the local area, including from both sides of the United States-Mexican border, and many of them were undocumented migrants who moved back and forth across. These artists would often pick cotton by day, and make music at night. After signing Los Alegres de Terán, Ramirez recognized conjunto as a powerful cultural development, and actively sought to find other artists in that genre. Falcon was one of the few local record labels catering to Spanish-speaking audiences that expanded beyond local distribution. Ramirez returned to Afro-Cuban music in 1952 when Orquesta Falcon was formed, a unit which eventually toured Cuba. In the 1950s the label was flourishing financially, but Ramirez's knowledge of copyright was insufficient and he found himself in some legal trouble.
In 1954 the label signed Chelo Silva, a bolero singer whose style was a departure from the accordion-based groups for which Falcon was most known. Her Falcon recordings were distributed by Peerless Records in Mexico.
In the early 1960s Ideal Records became moribund, and Falcon became the undisputed leader of tejano music labels. He started a Spanish-language musical television program named "Fanfarria Falcon" which was created to promote Falcon artists, but consequently gave Tejano artists heretofore unknown national and international exposure. This syndicated program aired from 1964 to 1981 on 214 stations within the United States including the major Chicago and Los Angeles markets, and was also available in much of Latin America. Despite this, the Falcon experienced diminishing profitability and Ramirez sold Falcon to California-based CENTRON in the 1960s. CENTRON was unsuccessful with the venture, and subsequently returned Falcon to the Ramirez family. Arnaldo Ramirez's son Arnaldo Jr. became an executive of the company. The operation grew to include offices and facilities in Austin, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, and San Antonio.
Falcon recorded René y René after their 1964 hit "Angelito". Two unsuccessful singles released, and the remaining recordings were shelved. Recently returned from military duty, Arnaldo Jr. listened to the tape of the unreleased song "Lo Mucho Que Te Quiero" and decided to release it. The recording was Falcon's most successful recording selling more than four million copies. However, the record was released nationally on the White Whale label as Falcon's distribution did not reach English-speaking audiences.
Falcon signed Roberto Pulido y Los Clásicos in 1976, a move which proved highly beneficial to both parties. It became Falcon's best selling group in the 1980s, to the point that Ramirez called them his "bread and butter". The 1982 devaluation of the Mexican peso affected sales.
Falcon's recordings were sold to the Mexican branch of EMI sometime around 1990.
Name.
Ramirez named his company Falcon because he liked the action, aggression, appearance, speed and strength represented by that genus of bird. He also thought that the name sounded similar in both English and Spanish.
Legacy.
Falcon's studio location was an optimal spot to record rural "norteño" music, which appealed to both the working class Hispanic population, as well as to more affluent members of the ethnicity who were seeking nostalgia. This was in contrast to their main competitor Ideal Records, who recorded a more urban, "sophisticated" brand of "tejano" music called conjunto that appealed to the bilingual and the educated.
One of the first artists to sign to Falcon was Los Alegres de Terán, who continued to record for Falcon for more than 30 years. The group's recordings played a crucial role for "norteña" music, as their music became popular throughout Mexico. Lydia Mendoza and her family made numerous recordings for Falcon between August 1950 until at least 1968.
The exposure that resulted from Falcon's publicity enabled several Texas orquestras to not only survive but flourish, and a vibrant orquestra ballroom scene arose as a result, not only in Texas but across the Midwest. For many of its artists, Falcon provided an entry point towards recording with much larger record companies.
In 1974 Falcon released Tortilla Factory's self-titled LP. This album was noted for fusing traditional polka-rancheras with jazz phrasing and improvisation, an important innovation within the la Onda movement.
Ramirez disparaged some of his own product as "una porqueria" because of its origins among the very poorest classes. However, he also valued his product a culturally important to the working class, and as a tool to channel ideological currents.
In 1994 numerous historical artifacts from the Falcon operation were acquired by the South Texas Archives of the Jernigan Library at Texas A&amp;M University–Kingsville. An exhibit featuring these artifacts was on display at the library in April and May 1996.
Production details.
Falcon's records were pressed by Tanner and Texas from inception for twenty five years. When the Tanner pressing plant shut down in 1974, Falcon acquired its own pressing equipment and planned to print and manufacture record jackets in-house. Royalco International Corporation was formed to be the distribution channel for Falcon. Falcon Recording Company was a directly related but separate company that did the actual recording. This studio was also open for public use. Falcon's recordings were distributed throughout Latin and South America, but usually did not appear there on the Falcon label per se as governments required products manufactured by local industry. Instead, Falcons recordings would appear on local labels and Falcon would receive royalties and production credit. It was typical that Falcon would send out around 40 promotional records to radio stations for a release.
Subsidiaries.
By the 1980s, Falcon was running several subsidiary labels, which included:
At its peak, there were nine subsidiary labels of Falcon.

Eugène Brillié

Auguste Eugène Brillié (1863-1940) was a French engineer, who invented the first French battle tank the Schneider CA1.
Biography.
Early years.
Brillié was born on 8 May 1863 in the 19th arrondissement of Paris. After his studies at the École Centrale Paris, he began his career from 1887 to 1898 at the Compagnie des Chemins de fer de l'Ouest.
Cars.
He joined with Gustave Gobron to create the Société des Moteurs Gobron-Brillié and to develop an opposed-piston engine he had invented. The Gobron-Brillié brand acquired a certain fame. It participated in the Paris–Madrid race of 1903, and set speed records, including that of being the first car to exceed 160 km/h (100 mph). In 1903 the UK agents for Gobron-Brillié were Botwood and Egerton.
In 1905 the Gobron-Brillie British Motor Company was established.
In 1903, Eugène Brillié ended his partnership with Gobron. He created the automobile company Eugène Brillié and had cars of his design built by the workshops of Schneider &amp; Cie at Le Havre (former Forge Artillery Workshops and Chantiers de la Méditerranée, bought by Schneider in 1897). His brand was then offering passenger cars and utility cars. Schneider gradually took over the Brillié Company. While working for Schneider he designed the artillery tractor for the first motorized artillery system for Portugal. The design was based on one of his dump trucks.
In Belgium, Leon and Maurice Nagant of Liège made some Gobron-Brillie products under licence.
Locomotive.
Brillié designed an experimental Naphthalene locomotive, which was built by Schneider in 1913.
Tanks.
During the First World War, a meeting between Colonel Estienne and Brillié led to the development of a tank project in December 1915. In early January 1916, Marshal Joffre authorized the continuation of the project and, on 31 January, asked for the purchase of 400 of what were then called "land battleships" armed with 75 mm guns. These were the first French tanks, the Schneider CA1.
Death.
Brillié died on 28 May 1940 in Seignelay (Yonne).

The species was first described in 1999 by Leonid Averyanov, as "Hemipilia bidupensis". In 2010, he transferred it to "Amitostigma". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of "Neottianthe", "Amitostigma" and "Ponerorchis" were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. "Neottianthe" and "Amitostigma" were subsumed into "Ponerorchis", with this species becoming "Ponerorchis bidupensis".

Memorial hall

A memorial hall is a hall built to commemorate an individual or group; most commonly those who have died in war. Most are intended for public use and are sometimes described as "utilitarian memorials". 
In the aftermath of the First World War, many towns and villages looked to commemorate casualties from their communities. Community leaders were expected to organise local committees to construct memorials and halls, for the benefit of the local community, were often seen as appropriate ways in which to honour those who had lost their lives. Most incorporate a plaque or stone, individually naming casualties, although, in some cases, they were built instead of war memorials. Most First World War memorial halls would later go on to be rededicated as memorials to those who also died in the Second World War.
Memorial halls often serve the functions of village halls.

Anne-Lise Stern

Anne-Lise Stern (born Anneliese Stern: 16 July 1921 - 6 May 2013) was a French psychoanalyst and Holocaust survivor.
Life.
Family provenance and early years.
Anneliese Stern was born in Berlin and then spent the first twelve years of her life growing up in Mannheim, to where her parents relocated soon after her birth. She grew up in a family atmosphere of intellectual creativity, in which the guiding vision was predominantly secular and left-wing.
Heinrich (later Henri) Stern (1893-1948), her father was a Freudian psychiatrist. He was also a passionate Marxist and secular Jew. Her mother, born Käthe Ruben (1893-1968), who worked as a nurse, also came from a politically committed Jewish family. Her maternal grandmother, Regina Ruben, was a militant feminist and Marxist, and a "companion in arms" to Clara Zetkin and Rosa Luxemburg. During her childhood both Anneliese's parents were members of the Social Democratic Party, while her grandmother Regina, to whom Anneliese later dedicated some of her written work, had joined the more recently established Communist Party.
Flight from Nazi Germany.
The Nazis took power in January 1933 and lost no time in transforming the country into a one-party dictatorship. Like populists through the ages, the Nazis had gained public support on the twin pillars of hope and hatred. The hatred, targeted on political opponents and Jews, became an underpinning of government policy very much more quickly than many had thought possible, and a few weeks after the Nazi takeover Heinrich Stern, by now serving on the local town council, was arrested. Three months later he was released without charge. On the day of his release the Sterns left Germany with their daughter, settling initially with relatives in Paris. Dr. Stern's secretary, Käthe Seitz, stayed in Germany and opposed the Nazis. She was killed by decapitation.
France and war.
From Paris the Sterns moved to Blois in May 1933 and started to build new lives. Later they moved on to Lyon and from there to Nice. Anne-Lise quickly mastered the language and passed her school leaving exams ("Baccalauréat"). Towards the end of 1938 she and her parents were granted French citizenship. In the Autumn/Fall of 1939 France (and Britain) declared war on Germany: she had time to start her at Tours, but in May 1940, after more than half a year of so-called phoney war (waiting), the German army invaded and rapidly over-ran the north of France. With millions of others, the Sterns hastily joined the to the "free zone" in the southern half of the country which was governed for the next four years as an (initially semi-autonomous) puppet state from Vichy. By this time the Sterns were using French versions of their names. Henri Stern joined the French Resistance in the area round Albi. In 1943 Anne-Lise was living in Nice where she befriended Eva Freud, grand daughter to the iconic Sigmund Freud. The two of them worked together between November 1943 and March 1944 as secretaries at the . Later in 1944 Eva died of sepsis following an abortion, having been denied hospital treatment. (Olivier Freud and his family, like the Sterns, classified as Jewish by the Nazis and by the Vichy authorities, were living as refugees in southern France.)
Further to the west, Anne-Lise's father, Dr Henri Stern, was able to focus of food and care for internees at Gurs. The camp had originally been set up to accommodate returning "internationalist" fighters from the Spanish Civil War and was now being used to hold political and race based refugees from Nazi Germany. There was none of the systematic killing that was becoming a feature of the so-called death camps in Germany, and security, at least before 1942, was chiefly dependent on the extremely isolated position of the camp. There were stories of inmates freely visiting the nearest village during the daytime and returning to their camp accommodation in the evenings. But conditions were basic and food was in short supply. Henri Stern was able to extract from the camp his own mother and five other women from Mannheim. He accommodated them in a house which he rented for the purpose at Gelos near Pau. He also collaborated with the , a Resistance contact known to be working with the OSE and the Cimade, in order to try and rescue children who had been interned at Gurs.
During the second half of 1942 a large German army was destroyed at Stalingrad and a massive Anglo-American army invaded North Africa. In France the German army reacted by taking over southern France from the Vichy government. In the streets it became progressively harder to avoid encountering Gestapo officers and their French collaborators. Anne-Lise Stern now lived under a false identity and, after the death of her friend Eva Freud, made her way at the start of 1944 to Paris. Here someone denounced her to the authorities as Jewish. She was arrested on 1 April 1944.
Concentration camps.
Anne-Lise Stern was deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau in , which departed from Drancy (near Paris) on 13 April 1944. Of the estimated 1,500 deportees it is believed 105 were still alive when the war ended in 1945. Her travelling companions included 34 of the , rounded up a week earlier on the orders of Klaus Barbie: the children were gassed on arrival at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Another of the travelling companions who survived the camps was Simone Jacob, usually identified in sources by her subsequent married name as Simone Veil.
She remained at Auschwitz-Birkenau till the autumn of 1944. Faced with the relentless advance of the Soviet army, the authorities now took the decision to evacuate concentration camps in the eastern part of Germany, which included Silesia. She was included in a convoy sent to Bergen-Belsen. From there, with the other women from her block, in February 1945 she was transferred to Raguhn, a labour camp attached to Buchenwald. In April 1945, she was sent in a convoy which took a week to reach Theresienstadt.
War ended in May 1945 and Anne-Lise Stern, liberated by the Red army, returned to France, arriving in Paris on 2 June 1945. Her parents had both survived the Holocaust years. Other family members had not. Her mother's sister Ilse was killed at Auschwitz. In Moscow another of her mother's sisters, the gynaecologist and noted abortion rights campaigner Martha Ruben-Wolff, had committed suicide in 1939 after was unexpectedly branded an anti-Soviet spy and "purged".
Postwar years.
During the summer of 1945 Anne-Lise Stern, still aged only 24, wrote several substantial essays about her concentration camp experiences. These were subsequently been grouped together and published in a single volume as "Textes du retour" ("loosely "Essays on coming home""). Pierre Vidal-Naquet considered that the little compilation "matched the peaks of concentration camp literature, alongside francophone versions of works by Primo Levi, "Ravensbrück" by Germaine Tillion, together with "le Grand Voyage" and "Quel beau dimanche" by Jorge Semprún. Despite her sudden success as a writer, and not withstanding the ringside seat she had been forced to occupy in respect of Josef Mengele's savagely cruel medical experimentation at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Anne-Lise Stern never turned aside from her long standing ambition to follow her father into the medical profession.
As Anne-Lise Stern left Germany, her father made the opposite journey, appointed an army doctor and mandated to visit several of the Nazi concentration/death camps. Henri Stern returned with some remarkable reports, but was not able to complete the task before he died of cancer in 1948, supported by his daughter and aged just 55.
The unconventional psychoanalyst.
Stern trained as a psychoanalyst, with . Her later teachers and mentors included Françoise Dolto and Jacques Lacan. In 1953 she met Jenny Aubry, a pioneer in child psychoanalysis in France, and joined her team, working initially at the Hôpital Bichat, and later at the Hospital for Sick Children in Paris. She focused primarily on hospitalised chronically psychotic children. She became convinced of a deep connection between holocaust experiences and the extreme mental suffering that it had led to in affected children, and accordingly took on the more difficult cases. Psychoanalysis, learned from leading practitioners of the time, became her life's passion. She was a particular admirer of Jacques Lacan, whom she credited with having re-established psychoanalysis after Auschwitz. In 1964 she joined Lacan's École Freudienne de Paris.
Prompted by the "events" (major street unrest and strikes) of May 1968, in 1969 Stern, with a group of supporters including the analysts Pierre Alien et Renaude Gosset, set up the "Laboratoire de psychanalyse", a treatment facility for destitute patients. The initiative was a consciously political one. Treatment sessions were provided for very low prices. Her mother had died in 1968, and she financed the project with the "reparations payment" which her mother had received from the West German government to compensate for the loss of her father's medical practice under the Hitler government. Between 1972 and 1978 she worked as a psychotherapist in the Department for Drug-Addicted Patients headed up by at the in Paris.
In parallel with her hospital work, she was becoming increasingly well known within and beyond medical circles as a prominent participant at the École Freudienne de Paris, through her contributions at symposia and through articles contributed to Les Temps modernes and other journals favoured by the intellectual classes.
In 1979, alarmed by the public manifestations in France of Holocaust denial, began to conduct regular seminars under the collective heading, "The camps, history, psychoanalysis - their connections with contemporary events in Europe". The first of these were held at her apartment, after which the larger home of the psychoanalyst Danièle Lévy, became the venue. Participants in those early days included Suzanne Hommel, , Maria Landau, Fernand Niedermann, Michèle Ruty, Françoise Samson, Nicole Sels, Michel Thomé and Liliane Zolty. Stern used these seminars to study contemporary documents relating to the Holocaust. From 1992, on the initiative of , the seminars were held for many years at the École des hautes études en sciences sociales ("School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences") in a left bank quarter of Paris.
In 2004 Anne-Lise Stern's book "Le savoir-déporté" ("loosely "The Deported Knowledge"") appeared. Together with her psychoanalytical essays published between 1963 and 2003, it constitutes a coherent report of her experiences in the concentration camps. The narratives are factual, without gratuitous attempts at commentary or explanation. In other chapters she describes her teenage years before the war, including her truncated period of study at Tours and the most significant encounters that she had before her deportation to the camps in Germany in 1944. The book allows the reader to share the author's vision of a "rebirth experience" resulting from the deportation and its aftermath, which provided the all-embracing context for her subsequent work as a psychoanalyst. She presents the Holocaust not as an ill-defined form of "big history" to be argued over by history scholars, but as a psychiatric reality.

Rotenese people

Rotenese people are one of the native inhabitants of Rote Island, while part of them reside in Timor. Apart from that, the Rotenese people also settled in islands surrounding Rote Island, such as Ndao Island, Nuse Island, Pamana Island, Doo Island, Heliana Island, Landu Island, Manuk Island, and other smaller islands. There are some who believed that the Rotenese people originally migrated from Seram Island, Maluku. They were thought to have arrived on the Rote Island during the reign of the Majapahit kingdom in the late 13th-16th century. It was during this time that there were references to the rulers of the Rotenese people. Initially, the Rotenese people founded settlements on the island of Timor, where they engaged in manual slash-and-burn farming and used irrigation system.
Language.
The Rotenese language is part of the Austronesian languages, from the Southwest Malayo-Polynesian languages, which are made up of several dialects. The main dialects are Lole (Loleh), Ringgou, Termanu, Bilba, Dengka, Dhao, Tii (Thie), Oenale and Dela (Delha).
Livelihood.
The livelihood of the Rotenese people includes agriculture, animal farming, fishing, tapping Neera and palm crafting. Lands that are well irrigated is used as paddy field or water catchment. The main farming produce are rice, corn, cassava, sorghum, millet, as well as other commodities like pepper, peanuts, vegetables and coffee; while the main animal farming are buffaloes, cattle, horses and poultry. Rotenese women work on traditional weaving handicrafts, woven Pandan leaves, pottery and so on. Small trades are also common.
Diet.
The most common diet of the Rotenese people are from tubers, porridge, and fish with spicy seasonings.
Social structure.
The kinship system of this people are nucleus family kinship or broad family with patriarchalistic in character, and also maintains an exogamy clan marriage customs. The formation of large families consist of the smaller clans called "nggi leo"; which in turn the formation of these smaller clans make up of the larger clans called "leo".
Religion.
The traditional beliefs of the Rotenese people centers on a creator known as Lamatuan or Lamatuak. This deity that is regarded as a creator, predestinator and the one who blesses, is symbolized by a three-branched pillar. Today, most Rotenese people practices Protestantism Christianity, Catholicism Christianity or Islam.
Culture.
Traditional Rotenese clothing is a "kain" (a cloth of up to 2.5 meters long, wrapped around the waist, reaching to the knees or ankles), as well as jackets and shirts, with a specific style of a straw hat called "ti'i langga". A typical family is small and based on patrilocal marriage; where the wife resides in the community of her husband.

Thadée Gabrielli

Thadée Jean Auguste Gabrielli (7 August 1856 – 10 April 1940) was a French lawyer, magistrate deputy and senator of Corsica.
Early years (1856–1902).
Thadée Gabrielli was born on 7 August 1856 in Tralonca, Corsica.
He came from an old family from the Corte region.
His brother Louis Gabrielli also became an advocate, and was general councillor of Moïta and Mayor of Zuani.
Thadée Gabrielli had a classical education in Bastia, and studied law at the University of Aix-en-Provence.
He obtained his license as a lawyer in 1879 and registered as an advocate at the bar of Corte in the Bastia Court of Appeal.
On 1 August 1886 Gabrielli was elected general councillor for the canton of Sermano in a strongly contested election.
He was reelected without opposition in 1892 and 1898.
He was general councillor of Sermanu until 1919.
He was very active in the general council as rapporteur on local roads, rapporteur general on the budget, member of the departmental committee and secretary or vice-president of the departmental assembly on several occasions.
Gabrielli became a magistrate in August 1892.
He was in turn state prosecutor at the Sartène court and then the Ajaccio court.
He married Lucie Campi (born 1871).
In 1901 he became advocate general at the Bastia court of appeal.
Politician (1902–1920).
During the 1902 legislative elections out of loyalty to the Republican party he declined to oppose the incumbent deputy for Corte, Marius Giacobbi.
Instead he ran as Republican candidate on 27 April 1902 in Sartène and was elected by 5,955 votes against 748 to the runner-up Jean-Paul Susini, a nationalist.
In the chamber he sat with the democratic union group.
In 1905 he tabled a draft resolution in the National Assembly on completion of the railway on the east coast of Corsica.
In 1906 he published the newspaper "Le Petit Sartenais".
During the 20 May 1906 general election Gabrielli won 4,228 votes against 4,085 for his only competitor, Quilichini.
The election was protested but was confirmed on 9 July 1906.
In 1909 Gabrielli ran in a senatorial by-election to replace two Corsian senators, Arthur Ranc and Emmanuel Arène, who had died.
Gabrielli and Nicolas Péraldi were elected, Gabrielli with 678 votes and Péraldi with 530 against 259 for Dominique Forcioli, the nearest runner-up.
During the triennial renewal Gabrielli, Paul Doumer and Antoine Gavini made a joint list, which was elected in full against the list of Paul de Casabianca.
The former senators Casabianca and Giacobbi protested that the election had been marred by corruption, but did not give proof and the senate validated the election.
Gabrielli was a moderate but convinced Republican.
He spent much of his parliamentary career defending the interests of Corsica.
He often intervened in debates, particularly concerning the budget, advocating forest roads and railways from Ghisonaccia to Bonifacio, the Castelluccio penitentiary in Ajaccio, sanitation on the east coast and military service.
He was also interested in issues related to the sea in general, was a member of the navy committee and discussed subjects such as the law of towing, the naval code of justice and sale of land on litoral islands.
He was a member of the postal committee and other committees.
Later career.
Gabrielli resigned on 8 November 1920 ahead of the January 1921 renewal to accept a position as judge in the civil court of the Seine department.
He spent six years as a judge before retiring on 8 August 1926.
In 1937 he published a 239-page history of Corsica from its struggle for independence from Genoa to its annexation by France, and then its participation in the French government from the French Revolution to the time of writing.
The work has been described as a "rather dry summary of facts and names".
It is alleviated by a short but enthusiastic history of Napoleon.
Thadée Gabrielli died on 10 April 1940 in Compiègne, Oise.

Harpsichord Concerto in A major, BWV 1055

The Harpsichord Concerto in A major, BWV 1055, is a concerto for harpsichord and string orchestra by Johann Sebastian Bach. It is the fourth keyboard concerto in Bach's autograph score of .
History.
Unlike Bach's other harpsichord concertos, BWV 1055 has no known precursors, either as an instrumental concerto or as a movement with obbligato organ in a cantata. It has generally been accepted that it is a reworking of a lost instrumental concerto, since Donald Francis Tovey first made the suggestion in 1935, when he proposed the oboe d'amore as the melody instrument. Additional reasons for the oboe d'amore have been given by Ulrich Siegele in 1957, Wilfried Fischer in 1970, Hans-Joachim Schulze in 1981 and Werner Breig in 1993; Schulze has dated the original concerto to 1721; and a reconstruction as a concerto for oboe d'amore and strings was prepared by Wilfried Fischer in 1970 for Volume VII/7 of the Neue Bach-Ausgabe edition. Another proposed instrument has been the viola d'amore, first suggested by Wilhelm Mohr in 1972; additional reasons for choosing the viola d'amore as a possible melody instrument were later given by Hans Schoop in 1985 and Kai Köpp in 2000, but in 2008 Pieter Dirksen gave reasons why he considered it unlikely to have been the original melody instrument.
Structure.
Scoring: harpsichord solo, violin I/II, viola, continuo (cello, violone)
First movement.
As explains in his preface to the Neue Bach-Ausgabe edition, in compositional terms, BWV 1055 is one of the most concentrated and mature of Bach's concertos. The opening movement is an Allegro in A major and . It is written in da capo "A"–"B"–"A′" form. Mostly light and nimble in spirit, the movement starts with a 16-bar ritornello broken up into two halves, each 8 bars long. In the first solo episode, the harpsichord introduces its own more sustained thematic material as well as semiquaver passagework derived from the end of the second half of the ritornello. All the harpsichord solo passages are based on or develop this thematic material.
The two bar "motto" or "Vordersatz" opening the ritornello, consisting of rhythmic "spiccato" quaver figures in the strings and cascading broken chord semiquavers in the harpsichord, recurs throughout the movement, heralding solo episodes for the harpsichord. In the remainder of "A" section, the second episode is introduced by the two bar motto and followed by a reprise of the entire first half of the ritornello. Section "B" starts with an 8-bar solo episode and has three more solo episodes, punctuated by the two-bar ritornello motto. In the second bar of the first episode the sustained harpsichord material is heard in counterpoint to the motto theme in the strings, now starting in the middle of a bar. The second and third episode are 6 bars long in E major/F minor and B minor/C minor. The fourth and longest, which ends section "B", is 12 bars long, starting in C minor and ending back in the tonic key of A major. Section "A′" starts at bar 79 with what sounds like a reprise of the ritornello—the two-bar motto in its original key; but, as Bach did in many of his concertos, it is interrupted by a solo episode for harpsichord—a variant of the episode introducing section "B"—before the true reprise of the complete ritornello that concludes the movement.
Second movement.
The slow movement of BWV 1055 is a highly expressive Larghetto in F minor and time. Although it does not have the dotted rhythms of a siciliano, it is close in spirit to this melancholy dance-form. The movement is pervaded by the chromatic fourth—both falling and rising—which is associated with the lamento. It is first heard in the descending bass line of the opening two bar ritornello, which frames the work. The material between the opening and closing the ritornellos is freely developed, but nevertheless has some elements of sonata form, most significantly a division into two parts with the second part starting in the relative major key (bars 3–13 and bars 14–36).
In the opening ritornello, the motifs in the first violin part involve a dramatic downward drop in register onto chromatic notes which break the harmony. The lilting rhythms of the first violin and the slower rhythms of the middle strings continue throughout the movement as a form of quasi-ostinato, repeating every two bars. As with the other concertos, the harpsichord plays as a continuo instrument during the orchestral ritornellos. In the autograph manuscript there is a figured bass in the continuo part, but it is known whether this was added later, so no further instruments beyond harpsichord and strings are required for performance. The harpsichord enters with its own material in the third bar. The material in a long four bar phrase contrasts with the monumental ritornello, with an expressive melodic line of legato semiquaver figures weaving between long sustained notes, either played off the beat or approached through sighing appoggiaturas. Further dynamical contrast is created by the lowest string parts falling silent, the bass line being provided just by the harpsichord: until halfway through the second part (bar 23), the accompaniment is provided only by the two violins and viola, marked "piano". After the first solo episode, which modulates from F minor to C sharp minor, a modified version of the ritornello is heard again, but now with the chromatic fourth rising in the bass line. It serves as a bridge passage during which the tonality modulates back to F minor. At that point the true opening ritornello is heard once more, but now as a counterpoint to the beginning of the second solo episode of the harpsichord. Now extended to six bars, it leads up to a cadence in C minor marking the end of the first part; the lowest strings briefly punctuate the cadence.
At bar 14, the beginning of the second part, the harpsichord begins a long 8-bar passage in the key of A major, the relative major key, introducing the "Sietensatz" its second thematic material. For two bars, in contrast to the first and second episodes, it plays sustained notes on the beat followed by semiquavers, with a left hand accompaniment of descending quaver triads in major keys. The accompanying ritornello figures in the upper and middle string accompaniment are inverted and played in unison during the first two bars. After two bars, the episode returns to the minor mode with two bars of semiquaver figures, which are repeated two bars later a minor third higher. This culminates in two bars where the music is at its most intense: the upper and middle strings play a variant of the original uninverted ritornello theme; in the harpsichord a descending chromatic fourth in the left hand plays beneath sighing figures reprised from the first episode which descend to a closing cadence in B minor.
At the cadence there is a full orchestral tutti—the lowest strings once more joining the ripieno section—in a version of the opening ritornello, but now with a rising chromatic fourth in the top notes of the first violin, as the key modulates to F minor. The harpsichord enters with a five bar episode formed by three phrases starting on sustained notes off the beat: the first three bars long with a falling chromatic fourth in the left hand of the hand harpsichord; the second and third, fragmentary one bar statements. These lead into a full recapitulation of the eight-bar "Seitensatz", but now with darker colours: the harpsichord starts lower down in the key of D major and the left hand part is joined by the lowest strings. At the end of this episode, back once more in the home tonality of F# minor, the movement concludes with a reprise of the opening ritornello.
Third movement.
The third movement of BWV 1055, marked Allegro ma non tanto, is in A major and the lively tempo of time. Lightly scored and written in a similarly compact style to the first movement, it begins and ends with an orchestral ritornello; and, like the first movement, it is written in da capo "A"–"B"–"A′" form. Section "A" occupies bars 1–82; section "B", which starts in the dominant key of E major and ends in the mediant key of C minor, comprises bars 83–138; and the reprise "A′" takes place in bars 139–200.
The opening 24-bar ritornello is rhythmic and dance-like; it is broken up into four bar segments and contains a wide variety of thematic material. The main theme is played by the first violin part, which the harpsichord doubles in the right hand while playing the continuo bass in the left hand.
The florid style of the four-bar "Vordersatz" or "motto" of the ritornello is noteworthy for its flurries of rapid semidemiquaver scales. The "Vordersatz" is answered by a four bar phrase of semiquaver motifs in sequence. The remainder of the ritornello repeats this material until the concluding "Epilog" (bars 20–24) which has a sequence of one-bar figures in dotted rhythm incorporating joyful dactyls. The music of the ritornello, including the different quaver figures in the accompaniment, is re-used throughout the rest of the movement, the thematic material recurring mostly in shortened fragments.
After the ritornello, the harpsichord enters in the first of its solo episodes, 16 bars long. Its new melodic material contrasts with the ritornello, with sustained notes and graceful ornamentation typical of the galant style, at first accompanied only by repeated quavers in the left hand and upper strings.
The ripieno section responds with one of the later segments of the ritornello; this is followed by a shorter episode for harpsichord which incorporates semiquaver motifs from the ritornello; and the ripieno responds with a variant of the semidemiquaver motto. After this dialogue, a second extended solo episode introduces new semiquaver triplet scale figures in the harpsichord, accompanied by detached quavers in the strings derived from the ritornello.
This is followed by another dialogue between soloist and ripieno based on the ritornello material. It ends with the harpsichord doubling the highest and lowest string parts—the "unison" method by which Bach incorporates the soloist in the ripieno—bringing section "A" to a close in the dominant key of E major.
In section "B" the thematic material from section "A" is developed more freely in the harpsichord part with semidemiquaver figures modified to semiquaver triplets. There is further dialogue between harpsichord and orchestra followed by an extended episode with semiquaver triplet passagework in the relative minor key, F minor.
This is followed by an eight-bar "unison" ritornello modulating from F minor to C minor. Section "B" concludes with a second extended solo episode in the mediant key of C minor, during which the orchestral ritornello material is heard over a harpsichord trill and in counterpoint before the cadence.
The recapitulation section "A′", back in the tonic and dominant keys, begins with the first six bars of the ritornello, the harpsichord doubling the strings. This is interrupted by two last solo episodes for the harpsichord, abridged from section "A" and punctuated by a short ritornello motif in the strings. The movement concludes with a complete reprise of the opening ritornello.

Czech Brain Ageing Study

Czech Brain Ageing Study (CBAS) is a longitudinal, observational study on aging and dementia from two large centers in the Czech Republic combining clinical care and clinical research.
The pilot project leading to the pilot data for CBAS was established in 2005 as a longitudinal follow-up of subjects at risk of Alzheimer disease dementia (AD). A major step forward occurred in 2011 after receiving a substantial funding from the European Regional Development Fund and the Czech Ministry of Health. This funding enabled to establish the International Clinical Research Center (FNUSA-ICRC) in Brno and also enabled to synchronize the efforts in clinical and translational research between the ICRC and the Cognitive Center at Department of Neurology of the Motol University Hospital in Prague. CBAS now recruits a large numbers of participants across the two sites and is the only longitudinal study of its kind in the Czech Republic. It is also about to become the largest study to study risk factors for AD in Central and Eastern Europe.
Study design.
Participants undergo annual follow-up with clinical evaluations, multimodality brain MRI, comprehensive standardized neuropsychological testing including memory tests aimed to detect early cognitive decline and laboratory examination. The APOE, TOMM40 and BDNF genotyping is done at baseline. In a subset of participants, CSF and/or amyloid PET is performed. The majority of participants also undergo a unique translational, experimental neuropsychological protocol that has been inspired by animal research. This protocol consists of various tasks aiming to detect early cognitive and clinical impairment in AD spectrum.
The strong translational aspect of this approach, which includes the use of the human analogue of the Morris Water Maze, is aimed at the identification of individuals at preclinical and prodromal stage of AD. Biological sample bank (DNA, CSF and plasma) matched with the CBAS clinical data is also a part of CBAS.
From a biological point of view, one aim of CBAS is to biochemically characterize the subjects affected by AD dementia and related memory disorders. The search for new biomarkers has expanded in the last years in the attempt to characterize the disease stage and/or predict the disease course. The currently accepted view is that single measurement of biomarkers in plasma, serum or cerebrospinal fluid has been shown to be not sufficient per se and must be corroborated with combined biomarker measurements. Therefore, there is a focus on expanding the number of measurable biomarkers by including proteins related to the neuronal activity in the CNS, such as neurotrophic factors, enzymes regulating protein expression, and proteins related to neuronal/synaptic function, such as neurofilament light protein, neurogranin and contactin-2.
International collaboration.
The CBAS team is well established and internationally recognized, and has multiple international collaborations including Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard University (Boston), the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) and University of South Florida (Tampa, USA), as well as University of Queensland (Brisbane, Australia), Drum Tower Hospital and Nanjing University (Nanjing, China), University of Bonn, University of East Anglia (UK) and Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, Sweden).
Institutions participating in CBAS.
The Motol hospital is the largest hospital in the Czech Republic and Central Europe. The team affiliated with the hospital and Charles University in Prague specializes in the clinical research in the field of cognitive and behavioral neurology, including neuroepidemiology of neurodegenerative disorders leading to various dementia syndromes. The Cognitive Center has been a member of the European Alzheimer Disease Consortium (EADC) since 2017, and we are currently joining join the European Medical Information Framework (EMIF) and the Global Alzheimer’s Association Interactive Network (GAAIN) networks.
ICRC at the St. Anne’s University Hospital in Brno is a major healthcare center in Moravia region of the Czech Republic. The ICRC team specializes in the research of lifestyle as a risk/protective factors of dementia and on non-pharmacological interventions in prevention of memory decline. Because of our experience in delivering high-quality data, rapid study start-up and an access to substantial patient populations, ICRC Memory Center is a Quintiles/IQUIA Prime Site, and is a part of ECRIN European clinical research infrastructure network.

2018 Valencia, Venezuela fire

On March 28, 2018, a fire broke out during a prison riot in the cells at the Carabobo state police headquarters in Valencia, Carabobo, Venezuela. The fire killed at least 68 people and injured scores of others. The fire is one of the deadliest incidents ever in a Venezuelan prison since the 1994 Sabaneta prison fire, in which more than 100 inmates died. 
Four prosecutors have been named to investigate the circumstances preceding the victims' deaths. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights requested an investigation and reparations for the families of the fire victims.
Background.
Violence and overcrowding are problems in Venezuela's prison system. The Observatorio Venezolano de Prisiones (English: "Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons") estimates that 6,663 prisoners have died between 1999 and 2015, with average overcrowding at over 200%.
More than 60 prisoners died in the 2013 Uribana prison riot. The organization Human Rights Watch states that because of poor training and insufficient numbers of guards, corruption and deterioration of infrastructure, armed gangs have seized control of inmate populations.
Fire.
The fire began in the jail attached to the police station in Valencia, a city located about west of Venezuela's capital city, Caracas. The jail was built to contain only 60 prisoners, but when the fire broke out, it housed about 200.
The fire reportedly began when, during a riot, prisoners in the jail inside the police station lit their mattresses on fire in an attempt to escape. Later reports stated that the fire began during a party thrown by the inmates. Gunfire was also reportedly heard during the riot that preceded the fire. However, the circumstances surrounding the fire have yet to be officially confirmed, and local officials initially only confirmed that some people had died in the fire.
Later on the day of the fire, Tarek William Saab, Venezuela's lead prosecutor, stated that the death toll was 68, which included two women, most likely visitors; and Saab stated that an investigation would be started to “clarify” the incident.
Aftermath.
On the same day of the fire, relatives of the dead prisoners gathered at the police station where the fire occurred, but were dispersed by police using tear gas. The gas was used after the protesters attempted to push their way into the station and detention center in question, the Carabobo state police headquarters, with one officer being injured by a stone.
The governor of Carabobo, Rafael Lacava, stated his "consternation" over the events, and the human rights body of the United Nations called for an investigation. In a released statement, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights also requested reparations for the victims' families.
Political opponents of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro have seized on the fire as evidence that Venezuelan society has declined under Maduro's leadership. Venezuelan opposition leader Henrique Capriles tweeted "How many more times are we going to see the same Dantesque scenes with the prisoners of the country?"
Many of the dead prisoners were buried side by side, and three deep, in a mass grave separated by cinder blocks and marked by crosses.

John Davenport (economic journalist)

John A. Davenport (September 11, 1904 – June 8, 1987) was an American journalist and writer focusing on economics.
Davenport was born in Philadelphia. He graduated from Yale University in 1926 and became a reporter with the "New York World" from 1927 to 1930. From 1937 to 1949, he worked at "Fortune" magazine as a business journalist, where his brother Russell Davenport was managing editor. Since 1941, he was also a member of the board of editors at "Fortune". In 1949, he became the managing editor of "Barron's", another magazine owned by Henry Luce’s Time Life, Inc. company, where he stayed until 1954, when he returned to "Fortune" as an assistant managing editor (until 1969). Towards the end of his life, he lived in Middletown, New Jersey, and died at Riverview Hospital in nearby Red Bank.
Davenport was a founding member of the Mont Pelerin Society. Politically conservative, he tried to serve neoliberal and conservative causes as a journalist, especially when it came to the economy. He was also a vocal opponent of universal suffrage, and defender of white minority rule, in Southern Africa. In the 1970s, he travelled to Rhodesia and lobbied for the racist regime of Ian Smith in the US, co-chairing the American-Rhodesian Association. He also opposed sanctions against Apartheid South Africa, opining that "the world owes South Africa a debt for refusing to go along with the mania of majority rule and “one man one vote once.”"
His papers are held by the Hoover Institution Archives.

Ultra high temperature ceramic matrix composite

Ultra-high temperature ceramic matrix composites (UHTCMC) or Ultra-high Temperature Ceramic Composites (UHTCC) are a class of refractory ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), which aspires to overcome the limits associated with currently used CMCs (C/C and C/SiC) in aerospace field as thermal protection systems (TPS) and rocket nozzles. Carbon fiber reinforced carbon matrix (C/C) can be used up to 3000 °C because carbon is the element with the highest melting point however C/C are ablative materials which dissipate energy consuming themselves. Carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide matrix composites (C/SiC) and Silicon carbide fiber reinforced silicon carbide matrix composites (SiC/SiC) are considered reusable materials because silicon carbide is a hard material with a low erosion and it forms a silica glass layer during oxidation which prevents further oxidation of inner material. Unfortunately above a certain temperature (it depends on environmental conditions of oxygen partial pressure) starts the active oxidation of silicon carbide matrix to gaseous silicon monoxide (SiO(g)), consequently loss of protection from further oxidation, which leads the material to an uncontrolled and fast erosion. For this reason C/SiC and SiC/SiC are used in the range of temperature between 1200° - 1400 °C.
On the one hand CMCs are lightweight materials with high strength-to-weight ratio even at high temperature, high thermal shock resistance and toughness but suffer of erosion during service. On the other side bulk ceramics made of UHTCs (e.g. ZrB2, HfB2, or their composites) are hard materials which show low erosion even above 2000 °C but UHTCs are heavy and suffer of catastrophic fracture and low thermal shock resistance compared to CMCs. Failure is easily under mechanical or thermo-mechanical loads because of cracks initiated by small defects or scratches. The possibility to obtain reusable components for aerospace field based on UHTC matrix into fiber reinforced composites is still under investigation.
The European Commission funded a research project, C3HARME, under the NMP-19-2015 call of Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development in 2016 (still ongoing) for the design, development, production and testing of a new class of ultra-refractory ceramic matrix composites reinforced with silicon carbide fibers and Carbon fibers suitable for applications in severe aerospace environments as possible near-zero ablation thermal protection system (TPS) materials (e.g. heat shield) and for propulsion (e.g. rocket nozzle). The demand for reusable advanced materials with temperature capability over 2000 °C has been growing. Recently carbon fiber reinforced zirconium boride-based composites obtained by slurry infiltration (SI) and sintering has been investigated.

Scuttle (horse)

Scuttle (1925 – March 1934) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. She showed considerable promise as a two-year-old in 1925 when she won three races including the Cheveley Park Stakes as well as finishing second in the Queen Mary Stakes. In the following spring she won on her seasonal debut and then recorded a popular and impressive victory in the 1000 Guineas. In her subsequent races she finished second in the Epsom Oaks, third in the Coronation Stakes and second in the Nassau Stakes. She was then retired to become a broodmare but died in 1934 at the age of nine. She was the first and only classic winner owned by King George V.
Background.
Scuttle was a bay mare with a narrow white blaze bred at the Royal Stud at Sandringham by Major Fetherstonhaugh on behalf of King George V. She was sent into training with William Rose "Willie" Jarvis at his Egerton House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk.
She was from the first crop of foals sired by Captain Cuttle, who won the Epsom Derby in 1922, making her a representative of the Godolphin Arabian sire line. Captain Cuttle's subsequent stud career was disappointing and Scuttle was his only classic winner. Scuttle's dam Stained Glass showed promise but fractured her pelvis in a training gallop and it was only after lengthy rest and treatment that she was saved for broodmare duty. She was a great-granddaughter of Stone Clink, a top-class racemare who won the Northumberland Plate and the Cesarewitch Handicap in 1886.
Racing career.
1927: two-year-old season.
On 20 May 1927 Scuttle was well-supported in the betting for the Fitzwilliam Stakes at Doncaster and won from eight opponents. She looked to be an unlucky loser when running second to Stadacona in the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot before winning the Berkshire Foal Plate at Newbury Racecourse.
In October she was ridden by Joe Childs in the Cheveley Park Stakes and won at odds of 5/1 from Tetrill. On her final start of the season she finished unplaced in the Wilbraham Stakes at Newmarket.
She ended the year with a record of three wins in five races and earnings of £2,947.
1928: three-year-old season.
In the early spring of 1928 Scuttle was reported to be underweight and lacking in appetite but recovered after receiving "ultra-violet ray treatment" from the Jockey Club's veterinary surgeon Mr V. Pryde-Jones. The filly began her second season by winning the Brandon Handicap over nine furlongs at Newmarket in April. On 4 May, with Childs in the saddle, Scuttle contested the 115th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile and started at the 15/8 favourite against thirteen runners. The crowd at Newmarket included her owner the King and the Prince of Wales. The filly looked restless before the start and when the contest began she was left behind the other runners before settling towards the rear of the field. Grand Vixen set the early pace before giving way to Jurisdiction two furlongs out, at which point the favourite began to make rapid progress. Scuttle moved alongside Jurisdiction entering the final furlong and then "forged ahead" to win amid loud cheering and cries of "the King wins!" by a length with a gap of six lengths back to Lord Derby's Toboggan in third. Childs, who was given great credit for his calm and intelligent ride, commented "I knew this would come. I was in no hurry, especially as [she] is a good stayer".
Scuttle was stepped up in distance at Epsom Racecourse on 8 of June and started favourite for the Oaks Stakes over one and half miles. She tracked Toboggan for most of the way but was unable to make any impression on her rival in the straight and finished second, beaten four lengths by the winner. At Royal Ascot late that month, Scuttle was dropped back in distance for the one-mile Coronation Stakes and finished third behind Toboggan and the lightly-weighted outsider Romany Queen. At Goodwood Racecourse in late July or early August, she was beaten in the ten-furlong Nassau Stakes by the Alec Taylor Jr.-trained La Sologne, to whom she was conceding sixteen pounds in weight.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Scuttle an "inferior" winner of the 1000 Guineas.
Breeding record.
At the end of her racing career, Scuttle was retired to become a broodmare at the Royal Stud. She produced at least two live foals:
In March 1934 Scuttle developed a rupture after producing a filly-foal by Singapore. A haemorrhage ensued and despite the attendance of a leading veterinary surgeon, she died shortly afterwards.

Post Traumatic

Post Traumatic is the debut solo studio album by Linkin Park vocalist Mike Shinoda going by his own name instead of using the Fort Minor moniker. It is his second solo studio album after Fort Minor's The Rising Tied. It was released on June 15, 2018. The album was announced on March 29, 2018, along with the release of two new songs to promote the album: "Crossing a Line" and "Nothing Makes Sense Anymore". "Crossing a Line" and "Make It Up as I Go" were issued to radio stations as the album's two official singles.
Shinoda himself served as the primary producer of the album but with additional production on a few tracks by BASECAMP, Andrew Dawson, and Boonn. Linkin Park guitarist Brad Delson, Blackbear, K.Flay, Deftones lead vocalist Chino Moreno, Machine Gun Kelly, Ross Golan, Kevin Hissink (Boonn), and Grandson helped write a few songs whereas most of them were written by Shinoda.
The album contains content Shinoda recorded mostly by himself but additional instruments were played by Linkin Park drummer Rob Bourdon, Darren King, and Boonn with the content having been written by Shinoda after the death of his Linkin Park bandmate Chester Bennington on July 20, 2017. The three songs from the "Post Traumatic" EP are included as the first three songs of this album.
Background.
On January 25, 2018, Shinoda revealed his second project as a solo artist with the release of the "Post Traumatic EP", consisting of three tracks focusing on his feelings after the death of his Linkin Park colleague and longtime friend Chester Bennington, who died by suicide on July 20, 2017. Precisely because of the issues addressed in the songs, Shinoda decided to publish the album in his name, without using his previous pseudonym, Fort Minor.
In early March, he unexpectedly announced that he was working on a solo album, inviting fans to meet him that day in Los Angeles to hear a new song and to join a music video. The inviting fans' event was documented and featured on the music video of "Crossing a Line". The album was finally announced on March 29, which includes the three tracks on the EP, and according to a statement by Shinoda, "It's a journey out of grief and darkness, not into grief and darkness. If someone went through something like that, I hope you feel less alone. If it has not happened, I hope you feel grateful."
In May 2018, Shinoda unveiled the tracklist, which included collaborations with Blackbear, Grandson, K.Flay, Machine Gun Kelly, and Deftones frontman Chino Moreno.
Every song in the album has its own music video except for "Hold It Together". All of them were produced by Shinoda.
Composition.
The album begins with the three songs released on the Post Traumatic EP as the "grieving or lamenting" segment of the album. As described by Shinoda in an interview with KROQ, the album "goes from Nine Inch Nails vibes to N.W.A vibes." Some of the music is dark and grieving music while other music is upbeat and about different subjects. In an interview with "Vulture", Shinoda describes,
Writing and recording.
Shinoda wrote most of the music on the album himself, but songs like "About You", "Make It Up as I Go", "Lift Off" and "Running from My Shadow" were written with co-writers including: Brad Delson, Blackbear, K.Flay, Chino Moreno, Machine Gun Kelly, Ross Golan, Kevin Hissink and grandson. A leftover song from Linkin Park's last album "One More Light", "Place to Start", features percussion from band member Rob Bourdon. Darren King also provided percussion for "Hold It Together". Boonn produced and provided additional guitars for "Running from My Shadow". The album, primarily being produced by Shinoda, was also provided with additional production on few tracks by BASECAMP, Andrew Dawson and Boonn.
Shinoda also stated recording this album helped him in many ways but was a difficult thing to do. As he explained to "Kerrang!",
The music was recorded at Shinoda's home studio The Stockroom in Los Angeles.
Artwork and packaging.
The album artwork features a signature of Shinoda over a painting of his. Shinoda was helped by Frank Maddocks, who has previously contributed to artworks for Deftones, Green Day's "Revolution Radio" and Linkin Park's "One More Light".
The album was made available with an art book by Shinoda and Maddocks which is a double-sided 9" x 12" book includes expanded and exclusive full-color album art and images of Shinoda's painting series for "Post Traumatic" on one side, and coloring pages of original art when flipped over. The soft-cover art book was available bound with a clear O-card slipcase and includes the CD tucked inside a baby jacket.
On December 7, 2018, the vinyl edition was re-released with a bonus 10", featuring previously unreleased songs. This edition is notable with its slightly altered album artwork.
Critical reception.
The album received mostly positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has a positive score of 73 out of 100 based on 5 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic praised the album, stating that "While Post Traumatic takes an emotional toll, it ultimately instills feelings of hope and the idea that things can get better. For Shinoda, Linkin Park, and their devoted followers, it's an effective group therapy session." In a positive review, Ilana Kaplan from the "Independent" called the album a "triumphant debut", giving 4 stars out of 5. Dave Simpson from "The Guardian", noted that although "Post Traumatic" contains "flaws", he said that "its raw emotion is unusually touching and many will find it a source of tears, strength and comfort", giving 4 out of 5 stars to the album. Kerrang! praised the album altogether stating "It's an important, thoughtful album that will serve to unite the grief-stricken with a new-found sense of purpose to find some form of healing."

Us (James Bay song)

"Us" is a song recorded by English singer-songwriter James Bay, from his second studio album, "Electric Light" (2018). The song was released by Republic Records on 30 March 2018 as the third single off the album.
Background and release.
Bay told "Entertainment Weekly": "I've been lucky enough to meet people all over the world and witness the phenomenal strength of crowds. I wrote this song to explore unity and inclusion. Looking through the lens of my own personal relationships, this song turned out to be a particularly important moment on the album for me."
The song was re-released as a duet with Alicia Keys on 22 May 2018.
Music video.
The official music video to accompany the release of "Us" was directed by Bryan Schlam and first released on YouTube on 18 April 2018, through James Bay's official YouTube account.
Throughout the clip, Bay plays piano in an empty room. The visuals cycle through intimate shots of ordinary life: one person stares into a bathroom mirror, another reclines in the grass next to sprinklers, eats at a diner, daydreams in church. The video ends with the diverse cast united for the camera, emphasizing the title "Us" with the words "me", "you", "them", "him" and "her" crossed out.
Reception.
Ruth Kiane from "Entertainment Weekly" said: "The guitar-led track is more mellow than up-tempo second single "Pink Lemonade" and electro-inspired album lead "Wild Love" its smooth lyrics and sultry notes fit well into the singer's oeuvre. "I believe in something, I believe in us," sings Bay, which is reminiscent of his work on his debut "Chaos and the Calm".

Lieutenant-General Michael Brennan (189624 October 1986) was the Chief of Staff of the Irish Defence Forces from October 1931 until January 1940.
Brennan was born in Meelick, County Clare, and joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood in 1911. Two years later, he helped form the Irish Volunteers in Limerick city and soon he was training men in and around Meelick. He took part in preparations for the Easter Rising and spent the next five years in and out of prison and trouble, becoming the first O/C, East Clare Brigade, and later in charge of all three Clare Brigades of the IRA. This became the First Western Division, which Éamon de Valera reputedly described as the "best in the country".

Red Skirts on Clydeside

Red Skirts on Clydeside, produced in 1984, is the fifth documentary film made by the Sheffield Film Cooperative. It follows the process of rediscovering women's histories, focusing on the Glasgow Rent Strikes of 1915 and four of the women involved: Helen Crawfurd, Agnes Dollan, Mary Barbour, Jean Fergusson.
The title plays on the name Red Clydeside, given to the period of political radicalism in Glasgow and other urban areas along the River Clyde during the 1910s, 1920s and 1930s, but suggesting the involvement of women.
Synopsis.
The film follows the literal and metaphorical journey of the filmmakers as they attempt to unearth the details of women's political involvement in the Glasgow Rent Strikes, by visiting archives in Glasgow and London and through oral history interviews with several Glaswegian women who recall the period. We are shown both how women's contributions are often undervalued by archives and how personal narratives from marginalised voices can enrich our understanding of events.
The film's interviews with descendants of the strikers establish the link between the Glasgow rent strike and the women's movement of the 1910s. The astonishing extent of this mobilisation of women offers dramatic evidence of the political nature and potential of a supposedly unpolitical hearth, although the intimacy of the film's scope, and its focus on particular and personal accounts, prevents it from describing interactions between the women's movement, class struggle and the politics of European nation states. The interviewees do, however, describe their own lives and education as an informed and highly conscious political upbringing.
Participants.
The filmmakers speak to seven women during the course of the film.
Funding.
The production cost around £55,800 and funding was received from several sources, including the British Film Institute, Sheffield City Council and income generated by the Co-Op's speaking and distribution fees.

Woman's Improvement Club (Indianapolis)

The Woman's Improvement Club of Indianapolis, Indiana, was formed in 1903 by Lillian Thomas Fox, Beulah Wright Porter, and other prominent African American women as a small literary group to improve their education, but it was especially active and best known for its pioneering efforts to provide facilities to care for the city's African American tuberculosis patients from 1905 to the mid-1930s. The clubwomen also supported the war effort during World War I and provided social service assistance to Indianapolis's impoverished residents and its African American youth. By 1960, when tuberculosis was no longer a major health threat, the club continued its support of the local black community in other ways, such as a visiting nurse program and scholarships to students graduating from Crispus Attucks High School students. In the mid-1960s, after its membership significantly declined, its records were donated to the Indiana Historical Society.
Founding.
In the tradition of many other black women's clubs in the early twentieth century, Lillian Thomas Fox, along with Beulah Wright Porter, and other prominent women of Indianapolis's African American community organized the Woman's Improvement Club in 1903 as a literary group at Fox's home. The club offered its members an opportunity for self improvement and personal growth. 
Membership.
Fox, an African American journalist for the "Indianapolis News" and a local civic activist, was the primary leader and founder of the group. She also served as its president. Porter, a former teacher and Indianapolis physician, was a principal in the Indianapolis Public Schools. Her medical training was very beneficial to the club in its philanthropic work with tuberculosis patients. 
Several of the club's early members were recognized as prominent members of Indianapolis's black community, such as Fox, Porter, Ada Harris, Ida Webb Bryan, Roxie Belle, and Cora Jackson, among others. A few of its first members were professional women, some were educators, and a few were married to professional men (businessmen, physicians, and clergymen). Other members were household servants, cooks, seamstresses, or other domestic workers. By 1920s the club's members were mainly teachers and social workers. 
According to the club's constitution and bylaws, WIC membership was limited to twenty. The club's small size meant the close-knit group had to work closely together on projects. Membership in the exclusive club was passed from mother to daughter. 
Early WIC members "believed firmly in middle-class values and the middle-class way of life." They were also active in other local literary clubs, religious groups, and black organizations that held gatherings in Indianapolis, such as the Knights of Pythias, Afro-American Council, and Anti-Lynching League. Their involvement with other civic groups, as well as the local black community's physicians, businessmen, and church leaders helped widen the clubwomen's contact base and obtain support for WIC projects. Club members also supported women's suffrage. 
Early activities.
The clubwomen studied topics related to "racial pride and solidarity" and women's issues. They read the literature of African American writers, the poetry of Phyllis Wheatley, and learned about the lives of black missionaries, evangelists, inventors, and social and political leaders. The members also sponsored educational lectures to raise money for club projects. Prominent black speakers included Mary Church Terrell, the first president of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs; W.E.B. Du Bois, the author of "The Souls of Black Folk" and magazine editor for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells.
In 1904, its second year of existence, the club expanded its scope beyond literary studies to include philanthropic work. Its members began by focusing on the care of African American tuberculosis patients in Indianapolis. At that time city hospitals were segregated and primarily served the white community. There were no facilities to care for black tuberculosis patients, even though the disease had a high mortality rate among African American living in urban areas.
Health care initiatives.
By 1904 the WIC expanded its mission to include community service, with its major goal centering on improving health care for Indianapolis's black community. The club spearheaded efforts to combat tuberculosis and provide health care to African Americans afflicted with the disease.
The clubwomen began by raising funds to send small groups of the city's at-risk black children to the country to regain their strength. Suffering from poor health and inadequate nutrition, these children were deemed to be the most likely to be infected with tuberculosis. The club also established local nurses' training programs. In the early twentieth century nurses' training programs in Indianapolis hospitals were segregated, forcing African American students to leave the area to gain similar experience.
Oak Hill Camp.
With no government-funded support, the club obtained permission from William Haueisin, a local white businessman, to established Oak Hill Camp on his property in 1905. The fresh-air camp for tuberculosis patients is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
Oak Hill Camp was modest in size. It included just three tents with board floors and a temporary frame building that had a partition down the middle to separate the camp kitchen from the living quarters of the camp's matron/cook/nurse. The facilities operated only during the summer months from 1905 to October 1916, treating six patients at a time. The volunteer-run camp was chronically short of cash, but the WIC continued to operate it though numerous fundraising activities at local churches, donations from the community, and personal contributions from WIC members until it permanently closed in 1916. Encroaching development in the area, lack of adequate funding, and changes in trends for treating tuberculosis patients are cited as the likely causes for its closure.
Other projects.
After Oak Hill Camp closed in 1916, the clubwomen continued to raise funds care for the city's black tuberculosis patients and other projects. Between 1916 and 1918 the club raise funds by sponsoring numerous lectures to increase awareness and educate the community about tuberculosis and other community health concerns. Examples of the clubwomen's other projects include working with Mary Cable, principal of Indianapolis Public School Number 24, to open it as the city's first fresh-air school for African American students in 1916. The clubwomen also persuaded Van Camp Packing Company leaders to change its discriminatory practices and establish a division at its Indianapolis plant staffed with African-American women. In addition, the women hired WIC-member Daisy Brabham in 1918 as its first salaried visiting nurse/social worker.
Between 1910 and 1920, when health care facilities in Indianapolis were segregated and the city's black population was rapidly increasing, facilities in Indianapolis that provided care for black tuberculosis patients were limited. Sunnyside Sanitarium admitted only nineteen blacks in 1918. (The hospital opened in 1917 and was the only one in Marion County to provide care for tuberculosis patients.) Public funds were not allocated to assist black tuberculosis patients in the county until 1919. Despite challenges and setbacks, the WIC continued its efforts to provide tuberculosis care for blacks by becoming involved in year-round social work.
Wartime support.
In addition to its health care initiatives in Indiana, the all-black women's club supported the United States and its allies during World War I. The women raised funds for the War Chest Board and contributed to the National Colored Soldiers Relief Committee and Colored Soldiers Comfort Home. The club's fundraising efforts also assisted the orphans of black soldiers.
Ongoing community service.
After World War I the WIC continued its crusade to provide health care for African Americans suffering from tuberculosis. After earlier efforts proved to be unsuccessful, the clubwomen finally got the Indianapolis Flower Mission Hospital to agree to open a room for black tuberculosis patients in 1918, and secured funding from the War Chest Board to help finance it. In 1919 the clubwomen successfully petitioned the Marion County commissioners to appropriate funds to care for black tuberculosis patients at Sunnyside; however, the hospital's reports did not show any increase in the allotment until 1926 and continued to allot beds to black on a pro-rata basis of one-tenth of the county's population. To help compensate for the continued shortage of hospital beds for black tuberculosis patients, the club began providing care at the former Sisters of Charity Hospital in 1922. It operated the facility for two years before purchasing a home on Agnes Street in 1924. The Agnes Street Cottage had space to care for six patients at a time; about thirty-five patients per year. In 1938 WIC members persuaded the city's Flower Mission to establish a segregated wing at City Hospital to care and treat black tuberculosis patients.
In addition to its assistance to tuberculosis patients, WIC expanded its social services in the 1920s. The clubwomen provided aid to indigent blacks facing eviction and food to the city's impoverished and underfed African American children. The women also sent some of these children to summer camps in the country.
Later years.
With the development of new medicines and treatments, tuberculosis was no longer a major health threat by 1960. Although the club discontinued tuberculosis-related work, it continued to support the local African American community in other ways. The clubwomen paid a visiting nurse to provide advice to black families and to help them get medical care and social services. The club also provided scholarships to students graduating from Crispus Attucks High School continue their education. By the mid-1960s, with membership significantly declining, the club's records were donated to the Indiana Historical Society.
Legacy.
While other community groups participated with the Woman's Improvement Club, it is the group considered to be the initiator and leader of the effort to provide tuberculosis facilities for black patients in Indianapolis. Between 1905 and 1935 the club provided health care to the city's African-American community, especially its tuberculosis patients, assisted its impoverished residents, and aided at-risk youth. While the club provided its members with opportunities for personal growth, educational improvement, and community service, it approached tuberculosis work in the "professional and scientific manner that prevailed during the Progressive Era."

Zouches Manor

Zouches Manor (also Zouches Castle) was an Anglo-Saxon moated manor in Fulbourn Fen, a Site of Special Scientific Interest in the village of Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire, England. It is one of the historic Five Manors of Fulbourn and recorded to have existed 1066 AD to 1539 AD.
Creation.
The eponymous manor was built by Alan la Zouche, Earl of Brittany (the same family that held Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire) in the 13th century on an earlier site. The moat ditch and platform are likely to have been constructed in the 12th or 13th century, obscuring who exactly built the structure.
It came in the hands of the Zouches in 1230, following peace with Brittany. Alan la Zouche, then viscount of Rohan, granted his Cambridgeshire lands to Roger la Zouch. The Zouches and their successors continued to hold Zouches Manor of the honor of Richmond into the 15th century in socage, rendering two gilt spurs yearly into the 15th century. After 1500 the tenure was reckoned as knight service.
Dunmowes Manor.
It later came into ownership by the Dowcra family when it was known as Dunmowes Manor. There is ambiguity over whether Zouches Manor and Dunmowes Manor are the same or whether the latter was built by the Dockra family in the 16th century on the site of the former. The Dockra (or Dowcra) family has extensive history in the area.
Dunmowes Manor took its name from the Norman surname Dunmowe (Saxon '"Dommauua"', modern English "'Dunmall"'). The Domesday Book recorded the family as holders of a family seat as Lords of the Manor of Dunmow. It is unclear if this is Dunmowes Manor in Fulbourn or the Essex villages 30 miles away at Great Dunmow and Little Dunmow.
Location.
The location commands access to the village and the upland areas from The Fens and was probably chosen to defend against attack from the Fens during troubles such as the First Barons' War in the 13th century and the battles between the Romano-British (to the south), Anglo-Saxons (in East Anglia) and Belgae &amp; Norman invaders.
The site has been extensively archaeologically researched.

Georg Herzog studied at the Budapest Music Academy from 1917 to 1919, and at the Hochschule für Musik in Charlottenburg. Starting in 1921, he assisted Carl Stumpf and Erich Moritz von Hornbostel in the Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv. In 1925, he emigrated to the United States, where he received a postgraduate degree in anthropology from Columbia University. While there, he studied with Franz Boas, Edward Sapir and Ruth Benedict. In 1930/31 he went on a research trip to Liberia, where he recorded, on behalf of Sapir, the language and folk music of the Jabo people. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1935 (and 1947). Through field research, he wrote his doctoral thesis in 1937 "A comparison of Pueblo and Pima musical styles" which made him one of the fore-most authoritative scholars for American Indian music. He taught and conducted research at the University of Chicago, Yale University and Columbia University. During World War II, he worked in the US Army in Military Intelligence.
Herzog was a professor of Anthropology at Indiana University Bloomington from 1948 to 1958 where he formally established the Archives of Traditional Music which he had begun collecting in 1936 while he was at Columbia University. His establishing of a formal sound recording archive, in the model of the Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv, shaped the nascent field of ethnomusicology by centering the preservation of sound recordings as a crucial methodological approach in the discipline. This legacy was carried forward by his student Bruno Nettl who continued the work of bring together ethnology and cultural anthropology with historical and systematic musicology. Herzog was a North American pioneer in the field of ethnomusicology and posed such radical research questions as: "do animals have music?" (1941). 
Herzog was a member of the Board of Advisers of the Institute of Jazz Studies and was briefly president in 1955. He, along with David P. McAllester, Alan Merriam, Willard Rhodes und Charles Seeger, founded the Society for Ethnomusicology. After a serious illness in 1950, he had to give up work in 1958, retired in 1962, and lived for the next twenty years in a sanatorium.

Darian DeVries

Darian Dale DeVries (born April 7, 1975) is the head men's basketball coach at Drake University.
Coaching history.
A native of Aplington, Iowa, DeVries played collegiately at Northern Iowa. After graduating, he joined Creighton University as a graduate manager in its men's basketball program. After three seasons as a graduate manager, DeVries was named assistant coach in 2001. He stayed with Creighton following the departure of Dana Altman and the hire of Greg McDermott.
DeVries became a head coach for the first time when he accepted the job at former conference rival Drake in March 2018.
DeVries' steady hand at the helm of the Bulldogs helped the program start the season with 9-2 record, the program's best open to a season since 2007-08. The Bulldogs win over Valparaiso Feb. 16 was the team's 20th win of the season to mark the sixth 20-win season in program history. This accomplishment came after inheriting the second-fewest returning letterwinners in the nation thanks to Niko Medved gutting the program before moving on after one season with a senior-laden roster he inherited. 
DeVries' ability as a master tactician was further proven when starting point guard and potential MVC Larry Bird Player of the Year candidate Nick Norton suffered a season-ending knee injury in the first game of the MVC season. Despite a sense of complete despair from the Bulldog faithful, DeVries' team proceeded to win four of its next five games to move into a tie for third place in the league standings. At the close of the 2018–19 season, he was named MVC Coach of the Year.
DeVries' storied run at Drake continued in the 2020-2021 season where he took the team to a 18-0 start which included the Bulldogs' inclusion in the AP Top 25 poll. After losing two of their top players to injury, DeVries' once again showed his masterful hand at leading Drake to their first at large NCAA Tournament bid in years, and their first NCAA tournament win in 50 years to the day with a win over former Valley foe Wichita State. DeVries was also named Missouri Valley Conference Coach of the Year for the second time in three years.
Personal.
DeVries is the older brother of former NFL defensive end Jared DeVries.

Mandani Bay

Mandani Bay is a waterfront, mixed-use development currently under construction on North Reclamation Area, Mandaue City, Cebu, Philippines. The development takes its name from "Mandani", the former name of Mandaue, and "Bay" from its obvious waterfront location. This project is to be developed by HTLand Inc., a joint venture by Hong Kong-based Hong Kong Land and Cebu-based Taft Properties, the real estate arm of Vicsal Development Corporation, which also owns the Metro Retail Stores Group.
History.
In June 2015, Hong Kong Land and Taft Properties had formally announced their intentions on developing a 20-hectare waterfront development, to be called "Mandani Bay", "Mandani" coming from Mandaue City's pre-colonial name, and "Bay" from its obvious waterfront location. Though the project was announced in the middle of 2015, ground works started as early as February 2014, when the property location was fenced. The entire property is expected to be finished within "10 to 15 years" from 2016, when the first development within the property, the Mandani Bay Suites, was launched.

Dennis Leslie Scard (born 8 May 1943) is a former British trade union leader and musician.
Scard grew up in Harrow, London, where he attended the Lascelles County Secondary School. In 1962, he became a professional musician, playing the horn with a variety of orchestras. From 1972 onwards, he also taught music part-time at schools in Hillingdon.
Scard was active in the Musicians' Union (MU), chairing its Central London branch from 1972, and serving on its executive committee from 1979. From 1985, Scard worked full-time for the union, based in Birmingham. He was elected as General Secretary of the MU in 1990, defeating Stan Martin. He was also elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress. Under his leadership, membership of the union fell, but its financial position improved, as he merged small branches and ensured that all subscription income came to the National Office before a percentage was returned to branches. The union introduced incentives for young musicians to join, removed its joining fee, and increased insurance coverage and legal services for members. Scard also supported the incoming Labour Party government's Music Industry Forum, of which he was a founding member.
In 2000, Scard was defeated for re-election by Derek Kay, by 4,024 votes to 4,016. From 2002, he served on the Central Arbitration Committee, from 2005 on the Employment Tribunal Service, chaired the Shoreham Port Authority, and also served on the boards of a variety of music organisations.
In the 2000s and 2010s, Scard has stood repeatedly for Eastbourne Borough Council as a Labour Party candidate, and also in the East Sussex County Council election, 2013, but has never been elected.

The majority of the spots were awarded to the National Olympic Committees, not to specific athletes, at the 2019 World Rowing Championships, held in Ottensheim, Austria from 25 August to 1 September 2019. At the World Championships countries qualify boats rather than crews and can make crew changes for the Olympic regatta for qualified boats. Further berths are distributed to the nations at four continental qualifying regattas in Asia and Oceania, Africa, Latin America, and Europe. The last berths were distributed at the Final Olympic Qualification Regatta held in Lucerne, Switzerland 15–16 May 2021.
All qualifying NOCs are limited to one berth per event, and only NOCs with fewer than two berths from the World Championships may compete in the continental qualifying regattas. Host nation Japan will be automatically granted a berth each in the men's and women's single sculls, in case the nation fails to qualify for any rowing event at the various regattas.

St. MacDara's Island

St. MacDara's Island is a medieval Christian monastery and National Monument located off the coast of County Galway, Ireland.
Location.
St. MacDara's Island is located on a 60-acre (24.5 ha) granite mountain island off the coast of Connemara, west-southwest of Carna.
History.
Saint Sinach Macdara, patron saint of seafarers, is believed to have built a wooden church on the island in the sixth century. 
It was replaced by the present stone building in the 10th century. The roof stones were cut to mimic wood shingles.
Local fishermen traditionally dipped their sails three times while passing the island.
A wooden statue of the saint was paid special reverence by locals; in an act of iconoclasm the Archbishop of Tuam ordered it buried.
Every 16 July, local people make a pilgrimage to the island for a mass and blessing of boats (including the famous Galway hookers). Devotions were also formerly held on 28 September.
Description.
A stone church or oratory, probably a shrine for Macdara's remains. There are several cross slabs and an enclosure.

Mattawa Bay

Mattawa Bay is a freshwater body of the southwestern part of the Gouin Reservoir in the territory of the town of La Tuque, in the Mauricie administrative region, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
This lake extends in the canton of Poisson and Evanturel. Following the completion of the Gouin Dam in 1948, Mattawa Bay is in its present form as part of the Gouin Reservoir.
Recreotourism activities are the main economic activity of the sector. Forestry comes second.
Some forest roads serve the valleys of the Flapjack River, Bignell Creek and the Mégiscane River. These forest road branches connect to route 404 which serves the Mattawa Bay Valley and connects to the Southeast at route 400 which connects the Gouin Dam to the village of Parent, Quebec via the river valleys Jean-Pierre and Leblanc.
The surface of Mattawa Bay is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, but safe ice circulation is generally from early December to the end of March.
Toponymy.
The toponym "Baie Mattawa" was formalized on December 5, 1968, by the Commission de toponymie du Québec, when it was created.

Solea senegalensis

Solea senegalensis, the Senegalese sole, is a species of flatfish from the family of the true soles, the Soleidae, from the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea.
Description.
"Solea senegalensis" is very similar to the common sole and like it, it has a flattened, oval body with the dorsal fin starting on the upper profile of the head to the front of the upper eye. The dorsal fin has 73–86 rays, the anal fin has 61–74 rays and there is a well developed pectoral fin on each side of its body which has 7–10 rays. There are numerous, small, hair like fringes on the blind side of the head and the distance between the upper eye and the dorsal profile of the head is obviously greater than the diameter of the eye. The anterior nostril on the blind-side is surrounded by a small ridge but it is not enlarged. The caudal fin is attached to the last rays of the dorsal and anal fins by a narrow membrane. The lateral line is made up of 120–138 pored scales. It is greyish brown in colour on the eyed side marked with numerous blue spots, the spots tend to disappear in dead specimens. The pectoral fin on the eyed side has a nearly black membrane contrasting with cream coloured fin rays while the caudal fin is plain. The blind side is whitish. The main identifying feature which separates this species from the common sole is the black colour of the membrane between the rays on the pectoral fin on its eyed-side whereas the common sole has a neat black spot close to the margin of the eyed side pectoral fin. It grows to a standard length of 60 cm but is more usually 45 cm.
Distribution.
"Solea senegalensis" occurs in the eastern Atlantic from southern Great Britain and Ireland, where it is rare, to Angola, including the Canary Islands. It is found in the western Mediterranean as far east as Tunisia.
Habitat and biology.
"Solea senegalensis" is a demersal marine flatfish which occurs on sandy or muddy bottoms, these can be in varied habitats from brackish lagoons and shallow waters to coastal regions where the water can be 100 m in depth. The adults feed mainly on small benthic invertebrates, especially polychaetes and bivalves, with some small crustaceans. Females attain sexual maturity at around 3 years of age and a total length of 32 cm. Spawning takes place during the summer peaking in June around the Iberian Peninsula and in the Bay of Biscay when the water temperature is between 15 °C and 20 °C.
Taxonomy.
Over much of its range "S. senegalensis" is sympatric with the rather similar common sole and has been considered a subspecies by some authors in the past, "Solea vulgaris melanochira". It is however more closely related to the east Mediterranean Egyptian sole ("Solea aegyptiaca") than it is to the common sole, and where these two species' ranges meet there is a hybrid zone, with hybrids being detected from the Gulf of Lions and the coats of Tunisia. "S. senegalensis" is thought to have invaded the Mediterranean from the eastern Atlantic through the Straits of Gibraltar, a phenomenon knows as Herculean migration after the Pillars of Hercules.
Human interaction.
In Europe both the common sole and the Senegalese sole are landed and marketed and there is little distinction made between them in statistics. There are, however, different geographical preferences with the common sole being preferred in northern Europe and the Senegalese sole being preferred in more southerly areas and these preferences are reflected in the higher market price for common sole in northern and western Europe while Senegalese sole is more valuable in southern Europe. Off Mauritainia there is an artisanal fishery for this species and the Artisanal catch between 2006 and 2010 fluctuated between 117,328 kg to as low as 9,049 kg but information on fishing effort is lacking. It is widely produced in extensive aquaculture in Portugal and Spain.
The flesh is sold fresh, normally as fillets with smaller fillets going to domestic consumers and larger fillets to commercial markets such as hotels and restaurants.

Kanitha Wichiencharoen

Khunying Kanitha Wichiencharoen (4 November 1922 – 13 May 2002) was a Thai lawyer and women's rights advocate until late in life when she became a maechee. Most noted for her human rights work with women, she established the first emergency shelter for women in Thailand and wrote legislation to protect women's rights. She established the Mahapajapati Theri College, the first college to train women as Buddhist nuns in southeast Asia.
Early life.
Kanitha Samsen was born on 4 November 1922 in Bangkok, in the Kingdom of Siam to Thanom and Mangorn Samsen. She was one of two daughters of the couple and her father was a well-known lawyer, who served as a senator during the transition to a constitutional monarchy. Her parents encouraged both Kanitha and her sister, Kanok, in their education. Samsen began her studies at St. Francis Xavier Convent School and later attended St. Yoseph Convent School, before enrolling in law school at Thammasat University. After working for two years as a counselor with women who had suffered abuse and discrimination, Samsen moved to Washington, D. C. to study international law at American University and Columbia University in New York City. She then moved to Switzerland and studied international relations at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies for the year in 1949.
Career.
Returning to Bangkok, Samsen took a job at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where she met Adul Wichiencharoen, whom she would marry in 1950 and with whom she would subsequently have three children: Aim, Anik, and Art. In 1953, Wichiencharoen returned to the United States to study social welfare at Howard University in Washington, D. C. Upon her graduation, in 1955, she returned to Thailand and worked as a supervisor at the Standard Vacuum Oil Company. She also worked for USAID and then as the legal advisor to the Tourist Authority. In 1961, she began a three-year term as president of the Women Lawyer's Association of Thailand, traveling abroad as her duties required. As she visited other countries, she sought out women's shelters, intent on finding ways to improve services to women. She also instituted Saturday workshops where women lawyers gave "pro bono" legal advice to the public as a way of offering community assistance. Becoming the executive secretary of the Thai-American Technical Cooperation Association in 1963, she would serve in that capacity for the organization for the next twenty-one years. In addition, she advised as a legal counselor to the United Nations, various developmental NGOs and the petroleum industry.
In 1969, Wichiencharoen was selected as president of the International Women's Association of Thailand. Participating in the Thai women's rights movement actively throughout the 1970s, in 1974, Wichiencharoen became a founder of The Association for the Promotion of the Status of Women (APSW). The association, made up of both women and men began campaigning to revise and amend laws to provide better protections for women and children. She served as president of the organization and simultaneously became chair of the National Council of Women's standing committee on Women and Labor. Because there were no facilities available in Thailand to assist abused, unemployed and elderly women, Wichiencharoen opened her home to serve as an emergency shelter. When the police did not know what to do with endangered women, they brought them to her. She traveled extensively studying the situation of women around the world, participating in numerous conferences and academic experiences, such as a 1961 study of the family and youth courts of Japan; a 1977 assessment of the Australian family court and women’s shelters; a 1979 study tour which included observations at the Kansas City Women's Center, shelters in San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and a rape crisis center in New York; 1987 participation in the Federation of Soviet Women Congress in Prague; 1988 lecturer at the Nordic forum and Swedish Women’s Association, among many others.
In 1980, in response to needs identified by the Lawyer's Association, Wichiencharoen began a funding drive to establish a permanent women's shelter. Raising ฿50,000 ($2,000 US), APSW set up a shelter in the building of the Lawyer's association, offering housing, meals and medical referrals. The first women's shelter in Thailand, the Emergency Home and Relief Fund for Women and Children in Distress overflowed with clients. By 1986, they had outgrown their original space and opened a second and then a third home in the Donmuang District of Bangkok. Recognizing that their assistance was being provided after-the-fact, Wichiencharoen began raising funds to open an educational facility. The Women's Education and Training Center (WE-TRAIN), providing educational as well as vocational training, was established in 1988. Long wanting to develop a clinic to assist with pregnant women, in response to the growing needs of women after the HIV/AIDS epidemic was identified in the 1980s, a clinic was finally established.
In 1990, Wichiencharoen founded a policy research center to analyze and advise on socio-economic and political issues impacting women's lives. The Gender and Development Research Institute (GDRI), was established as an NGO, and works across the spectrum of social class to improve the welfare of women. Long aware of the discrepancies in the Buddhist faith regarding women in the ministry, and the subservience required of nuns to monks, Wichiencharoen became ordained as a "maechee" or "lay nun" in Sri Lanka in 1993. Keeping her title, "khunying", the equivalent of the British "dame", she received criticism from the media, but because the king had bestowed the title and failure to use it would be a sign of disrespect, she took the name Maechee Khunying Kanitha. As she was still involved in the advocacy work of APSW, she also did not choose to live in the "samnak chii" with the other nuns, but established a separate cottage where she lived with a few other members of the community. In 1996, she drew up and lobbied for passage of the Nun's Bill of Rights advocating that women in religious orders should have political autonomy protected by law and have sole authority for allocating their funding ad determining ordination or censure of members. Though the bill failed, she continued to press for measures to improve the perceptions and opportunities of nuns. In 1999, Maechee Khunying Kanitha, working with the Thai Nun's Institute and APSW founded the first college, Mahapajapati Theri College, to offer women a bachelor of arts degree in Buddhism and philosophy.
Death and legacy.
Wichiencharoen died on 13 May 2002 from cancer. She is recognized as a pioneer of women's rights advocacy in Thailand In 1990, at the festivities held at the Sorbonne in honor of International Women's Day, Wichiencharoen was honored as an outstanding advocate for women and in 1995, she received an honorary doctorate in Philosophy, Sociology and Anthropology from Ramkhamhaeng University.

Open Data Buffalo

Open Data Buffalo is the open data program developed under the administration of Mayor Byron W. Brown in Buffalo, New York. The initiative is a commitment to proactively release high-quality, updated "publishable City data" through a centralized portal in machine-readable formats, fully accessible and freely available in the public domain. Open Data Buffalo is an official City program designed to foster transparency, innovation, accountability, and efficiency.
History.
In May 2013, Buffalo earned a grant through IBM's Smarter Cities Challenge to bring a team of senior IBM executives to the city to offer advice on improving municipal policy with data-driven insights. One of their primary recommendations was for Buffalo to build capacity in "data-sharing and governance." Three years later, Buffalo joined the national network of Bloomberg Philanthropies What Works Cities to expand their use of data. With the support of What Works Cities, Buffalo partnered with The Sunlight Foundation to craft an Open Data Policy with input from the public using the Madison tool, an open source platform provided by OpenGov Foundation.
In September 2017, the City of Buffalo selected Socrata as the provider for the municipality's open data platform. The city launched the Open Data Buffalo portal on February 22, 2018 and kicked off the launch with the open of Mayor Byron W. Brown's Civic Innovation Challenge Powered By AT&amp;T, a tech competition designed to promote local engagement with the portal. The competition's challenge statement asks innovators to use City data to create solutions to address social and civic issues impacting Buffalo residents.
Datasets.
As of October 2019, the Open Data Buffalo data catalog is federated with the New York State portal and includes over 654 data sets and 222 geospatial assets, over 60 of which are City publications. Buffalo's datasets and geospatial assets include:

Baojun 530

The Baojun 530 () is a two or three-row compact crossover SUV produced by SAIC-GM-Wuling (SGMW). Unveiled at the Auto Guangzhou 2017, Baojun 530 took design cues from the smaller 510 and is a successor of the 560, while the 560 remained briefly on sale as a cheaper alternative. The crossover is an example of an extensive badge engineering; it is marketed under four different brands in several different markets.
The Baojun 530 started sale in China in February 2018. It started production in Indonesia in January 2019 as the Wuling Almaz, making Indonesia the first market outside China to receive the 530 model. In November 2018, the 530 was also introduced as the second generation Chevrolet Captiva in Colombia. The Chevrolet-badged 530 went on sale in select South American markets in April 2019, being fully imported from China. It was launched in India as MG Hector on 27 June 2019 as the first model released by MG Motor India.
Overview.
In the Chinese domestic market, the 530 is positioned above the 510 subcompact crossover and under the later released RS-5 within Baojun's line-up. Initial pricing of the 530 ranges from 78,800 yuan to 119,800 yuan. The 530 in China is offered with a 1.5-litre turbo petrol engine with the turbocharger sourced from Honeywell, paired with either 5-speed manual and DCT, and a 1.8-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine, paired with a 5-speed AMT.
In November 2018, the 2019 model was launched with a CVT with 8-speed simulation jointly developed with Bosch, slight adjustments to the engine power and torque, and a new speedometer layout. In January 2019, the 7-seater version of the 530 was launched.
In 2018, 116,324 units were sold in China.
Facelift.
The facelifted version of the 530 was released on 20 September 2019, featuring the new Baojun design language. It also received a 10.4" head unit with an integrated air conditioning control, a full LCD speedometer and a 6-seater configuration as an option.
Overseas markets.
Wuling Almaz.
The 530 is marketed in Indonesia under the Wuling brand with the name Almaz, which was revealed on 23 January 2019 and launched to the market on 27 February 2019. The "Almaz" name, which is a modification of Almas, means "diamond" in Arabic. A left-hand-drive prototype was previously displayed at the 26th Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show in August 2018 under the Wuling SUV name as an introduction. The car is manufactured in Indonesia with 43.5 percent of the component is sourced locally. At launch, the crossover is offered in only one variant with five seats. It is equipped with a 1.5-litre petrol engine with turbocharger producing 140 hp, instead of 145–147 hp in other markets. Initially, Almaz was only offered with a Bosch-designed CVT.
Being the first right-hand-drive model of the 530 platforms, Almaz immediately received a 10.4" head unit with an integrated air conditioning control, smartphone mirroring functionality dubbed as "Wuling Link" and other vehicle settings control embedded, which for the left-hand model was meant to be a later upgrade from the existing 8" floating head unit. After its release, Almaz received 2,000 bookings in two months.
A 7-seater version was revealed on 11 July 2019 and launched at the 27th Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show alongside a new voice command system named "WIND" (Wuling Indonesian Command), which only supports the Indonesian language.

2021 UEFA Nations League Finals

The 2021 UEFA Nations League Finals will be the final tournament of the 2020–21 edition of the UEFA Nations League, the second season of the international football competition involving the men's national teams of the 55 member associations of UEFA. The tournament will be held in Italy from 6 to 10 October 2021, and will be contested by the four group winners of Nations League A. The tournament will consist of two semi-finals, a third place play-off and final to determine the champions of the UEFA Nations League.
Portugal were the defending champions, having won the inaugural 2019 finals. However, they failed to qualify for the 2021 finals after finishing second in their group behind France.
Format.
The Nations League Finals will take place in October 2021 and will be contested by the four group winners of League A. The four teams were each drawn into a five-team group (rather than a six-team group) for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification group stage, thereby leaving the October 2021 window available for the Nations League Finals.
The Nations League Finals will be played in single-leg knockout matches, consisting of two semi-finals, a third place play-off and a final. The semi-final pairings were determined by means of an open draw. All matches in the tournament will utilise the goal-line technology and video assistant referee (VAR) systems.
In the Nations League Finals, if the scores are level at the end of normal time:
On 31 March 2021, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the use of a maximum of five substitutions in matches at the Nations League Finals (with a sixth allowed in extra time). However, each team are only given three opportunities to make substitutions, with a fourth opportunity allowed in extra time, excluding substitutions made at half-time, before the start of extra time and at half-time in extra time. The use of five substitutes has been permitted by IFAB during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the resulting fixture congestion, which has created a greater burden on players.
Qualified teams.
The four group winners of League A qualified for the Nations League Finals. All four teams are making their debut in the Nations League Finals.
Schedule.
The Nations League Finals, originally scheduled for 2–6 June 2021, were moved to 6–10 October 2021 following the rescheduling of UEFA Euro 2020 to June and July 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tournament will take place over five days, with the semi-finals on 6 and 7 October (the first of which features the host team), and the third place play-off and final three days after the second semi-final on 10 October 2021.
Host selection.
Italy was confirmed as the host country by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting on 3 December 2020. Only League A teams could bid for the Nations League Finals, and only one of the four participants is selected as hosts. The Nations League Finals are held in two stadiums, each with a seating capacity of at least 30,000. Ideally, the stadiums are located in the same host city or up to approximately apart.
On 24 September 2020, UEFA announced that Italy, the Netherlands and Poland had declared interest in hosting the tournament, all three of which are members of Group A1. Italy were confirmed as winners of Group A1 over the Netherlands and Poland on 18 November 2020, thereby confirming hosting rights, which were confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee on 3 December 2020, the same day as the Nations League Finals draw. If the fourth member of the group, Bosnia and Herzegovina, had qualified for the Nations League Finals, the UEFA Executive Committee would have decided the venues.
Bidding venues
Venues.
In their bid dossier, the Italian Football Federation proposed the San Siro in Milan and Juventus Stadium in Turin as the venues.
Draw.
The semi-final pairings were determined by means of an open draw on 3 December 2020, 17:30 CET, at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. The first two teams drawn were allocated to match pairing A, while the remaining two teams drawn were allocated to match pairing B. For scheduling purposes, the host team was allocated to the first semi-final as the administrative home team. The administrative home team for both the third place play-off and final were predetermined as the teams which advanced from semi-final 1.
Squads.
Each national team has to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom have to be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament. If a player becomes injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he will be replaced by another player.

The election was held simultaneously with other provincial and local elections across the country as part of the 2017 local elections. It pitted incumbent Rano Karno against People's Representative Council member and former mayor of Tangerang Wahidin Halim.
Wahidin, supported by a coalition of 6 parliamentary parties, secured a landslide victory in his former constituency at Tangerang, and defeated Rano with a margin of 90,000 votes despite losing in 6 of the other 7 regencies and cities.
Background.
Ratu Atut Chosiyah served as the governor of Banten - Indonesia's fifth most populous province - between 2007 and 2014, until she was arrested for a bribery scandal related to an election dispute. Some has described her family's influence in the province as a "political dynasty". 2017 marked the second time Indonesia held local elections simultaneously, after the 2015 local elections.
After some time being acting governor, former actor Rano Karno who was also Atut's deputy was sworn in the governor to replace her in August 2015. The Election Supervisory Council (Bawaslu) identified Banten as a vulnerable region for the 2017 election, alongside Aceh and West Papua. In particular, the body cited the strong presence of political dynasties.
Timeline.
Registration for the candidates opened between 28 and 30 August 2016, with the campaign period ranging from October 2016 to February 2017. The voting itself took place on 15 February 2017. The results were planned to be released in March 2017.
Issues.
Affiliation with Atut's dynasty became a major issue in the campaign. Both candidates accused each other of being affiliated with her dynasty: Rano-Embay because Rano was Atut's deputy, Wahidin-Andika because Andika is Ratu Atut's son. Atut herself voiced support for her son.
Results.
On 5 April, KPU officially announced Wahidin-Andika as the winning pair.
Aftermath.
Following the defeat, PDI-P leader Megawati Soekarnoputri removed the party's leaders in Banten. Rano brought the election to the Constitutional Court, which rejected his lawsuit (citing that the difference in votes was too large) and declared the election valid. On 12 May 2017, Wahidin was sworn in as the new governor.

Cristo Rey Church

Cristo Rey Church () is a Roman Catholic parish church on Canyon Road in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It is one of the most notable buildings designed by influential Santa Fe architect John Gaw Meem and is claimed by some sources to be the largest adobe building in the United States. It is also notable for its historic altar screen, the Reredos of Our Lady of Light, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The reredos was carved in 1761 and originally hung in "La Castrense", a military chapel on the Santa Fe Plaza. It has been described as "one of the most extraordinary pieces of ecclesiastical art in the country". The church was dedicated in 1940.
History.
The church was commissioned by Archbishop of Santa Fe Rudolph Gerken in 1939 and completed in 1940. The project served three purposes: to provide a new parish church on Santa Fe's east side, to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Francisco Vázquez de Coronado's expedition to New Mexico, and to provide a permanent home for the Reredos of Our Lady of Light. The stone reredos was carved in 1761 and was originally installed in the Chapel of Our Lady of Light, also known as "La Castrense", on the Santa Fe Plaza. More recently, it had been stored for decades under less than ideal circumstances in a rarely visited room of St. Francis Cathedral. The new church allowed it to be returned to full public display for the first time since 1859.
The church was one of the most ambitious adobe buildings ever undertaken in New Mexico, requiring 150,000–200,000 individual adobes. Around 120 laborers worked onsite to manufacture and lay the adobes and cut logs and branches into vigas and latillas. A total of 222 large logs were required for the ceiling. The church was dedicated on June 27, 1940.
Architecture.
Cristo Rey Church was designed by John Gaw Meem in the Pueblo Revival style, drawing inspiration from New Mexico's historic Spanish missions. In particular, the design borrows elements from San Estevan Del Rey Mission Church at Acoma Pueblo and San José de Gracia Church in Las Trampas. Like its antecedents, the church is built from adobe, though it is supported by a hidden steel frame rather than relying completely on traditional building techniques. The building is massive in scale, long, wide, and high, and the adobe walls are up to thick in places. Architecture critic Chris Wilson described the building as "the last, great adobe mission".
The facade is asymmetrical, with two battered towers of different heights separated by a recessed balcony above the main entrance. Inside, the church follows a traditional Latin cross plan with an aisleless nave, transept, and polygonal apse. The ceiling is supported on massive, corbeled vigas in the traditional manner, and there is a clerestory above the altar to illuminate the Reredos of Our Lady of Light which is installed at the west end. The pews, confessionals, and doors are all wooden and were made by students at the Lourdes trade school in Albuquerque.

Conflicts of interest in academic publishing

Conflicts of interest (COIs) often arise in academic publishing. Such conflicts may cause wrongdoing and make it more likely. Ethical standards in academic publishing exist to avoid and deal with conflicts of interest, and the field continues to develop new standards. Standards vary between journals and are unevenly applied. According to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, "[a]uthors have a responsibility to evaluate the integrity, history, practices and reputation of the journals to which they submit manuscripts".
Conflicts of interest increase the likelihood of biases arising; they can harm the quality of research and the public good (even if disclosed). Conflicts of interest can involve research sponsors, authors, journals, journal staff, publishers, and peer reviewers.
Avoidance, disclosure, and tracking.
The avoidance of conflicts of interest and the changing of the structure of institutions to make them easier to avoid are frequently advocated for. Some institutional ethics policies ban academics from entering into specific types of COIs, for instance by prohibiting them from accepting gifts from companies connected with their work. Education in ethical COI management is also a tool for avoiding COI problems. 
Disclosure of COIs has been debated since the 1980s; there is a general consensus favouring disclosure. There is also a view that COI concerns and some of the measures taken to reduce them are excessive.
Criticisms of disclosure policies include:
While disclosure is widely favoured, other COI management measures have narrower support. Some publications hold the opinion that certain COIs disqualify people from certain research roles; for instance, that the testing of medicines should be done only by people who neither develop medicines nor are funded by their manufacturers.
Conflicts of interest have also been considered as a statistical factor confounding evidence, which must therefore be measured as accurately as possible and analysed, requiring machine-readable disclosure.
Codes of conduct.
Journals have individual ethics policies and codes of conduct; there are also some cross-journal voluntary standards.
The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) publishes "Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly work in Medical Journals", and a list of journals that pledge to follow it. The guideline lays down detailed rules for conflict-of-interest declaration by authors. It also says; "All participants in the peer-review and publication process—not only authors but also peer reviewers, editors, and editorial board members of journals—must consider their conflicts of interest when fulfilling their roles in the process of article review and publication and must disclose all relationships that could be viewed as potential conflicts of interest". These recommendations have been criticized and revised to remove loopholes allowing the non-disclosure of conflicts of interest.
The Council of Science Editors publishes a White Paper on publication ethics. Citing the ICMJE that "all participants in the peer-review and publication process must disclose all relationships that could be viewed as potential conflicts of interest", it highly recommends COI disclosure for sponsors, authors, reviewers, journals, and editorial staff.
The Good Publication Practice (GPP) guidelines, covering industry-sponsored medical research, are published by the International Society of Medical Publication Professionals.
The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) publishes a code of conduct stating, "[t]here must be clear definitions of conflicts of interest and processes for handling conflicts of interest of authors, reviewers, editors, journals and publishers, whether identified before or after publication".
The Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association's "Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing" is intended to separate legitimate journals from predatory publishers and defines a minimal standard; clear and clearly stated COI policies.
A 2009 US Institute of Medicine report on medical COIs states that conflict-of-interest policies should be judged on their proportionality, transparency, accountability, and fairness; they should be effective, efficient, and targeted, known and understood, clearly identify who is responsible for monitoring, enforcement, and amendment, and apply equally to everyone involved. Review by conflict-of-interest committees is also recommended, and the lack of transparency and COI declaration in developing COI guidelines criticized.
, journal COI policies often have no enforcement provisions. COI disclosure obligations have been legislated; one example of such legislation is the US Physician Payments Sunshine Act, but these laws do not apply specifically to journals.
COIs by agent.
COIs of journals.
Journals are often not transparent about their institutional COIs, and do not apply the same disclosure standards to themselves as they do to their authors. Four out of six major general medical journals that were contacted for a 2010 COI study refused to provide information about the proportion of their income that derived from advertisements, reprints, and industry-supported supplements, citing policies on non-disclosure of financial information.
Owners and governing bodies.
The owner of an academic journal has ultimate power over the hiring and firing of editorial staff; editors' interests in pleasing their employers conflict with some of their other editorial interests. Journals are also more likely to accept papers by authors who work for the journals' hosting institutions.
Some journals are owned by publishers. When journals print reviews of books published by their own publishers, they rarely () add COI disclosures. The publishers' interest in maximizing profit will often conflict with academic interests or ethical standards. In the case of closed-access publications, publishers' desire for high subscription income may conflict with an editorial desire for broader access and readership. There have been multiple mass resignations of editorial boards over such conflicts, which are often followed by the editorial board founding a new, non-profit journal to compete with their former one.
Some journals are owned by academic societies and professional organisations. Leading journals can be very profitable and there is often friction about revenue between the journal and the member society that owns it. Some academic societies and professional organisations are themselves funded by membership fees and/or donations. If the owners benefit financially from donations, the journal has a conflict between its financial interest in satisfying the donors—and therefore the owners—and its journalistic interests. Such COIs with industry donors have drawn criticism.
Reprints.
A reprint is a copy of an individual article that is printed and sold as a separate product by the journal or its publisher or agent. Reprints are often used in pharmaceutical marketing and other medical marketing of products to doctors. This gives journals an incentive to produce good marketing material. Journals sell reprints at very high profit margins, often around 70%, . A journal may sell a million dollars worth of reprints of a single article if, for example, it is a large industry-funded clinical trial. The selling of reprints can bring in over 40% of a journal's income.
Impact factors, reputation, and subscriptions.
If a journal is accused of managing COIs badly, its reputation is harmed.
The impact factor of a journal is often used to rate it, although this practice is widely criticized. A journal will generally want to increase its impact factor in hope of gaining more subscriptions, better submissions, and more prestige. As of 2010, industry-funded papers generally get cited more than others; this is probably due in part to industry-paid publicity. 
Some journals engage in coercive citation, in which an editor forces an author to add extraneous citations to an article to inflate the impact factor of the journal in which the extraneous papers were published. A survey found that 86% of academics consider coercive citation unethical but 20% have experienced it. Journals appear to preferentially target younger authors and authors from non-English-speaking countries. Journals published by for-profit companies used coercive citation more than those published by university presses.
Journals may find it difficult to correct and retract erroneous papers after publication because of legal threats.
Advertising.
Many academic journals contain advertising. The portion of a journal's revenue coming from advertising varies widely, according to one small study, from over 50% to 1%. As of 2010, advertising revenues for academic journals are generally falling. A 1995 survey of North American journal editors found that 57% felt responsible for the honesty of the pharmaceutical advertisements they ran and 40% supported peer-review of such advertisements. An interest in increasing advertising revenue can conflict with interests in journalistic independence and truthfulness.
Sponsored supplements.
As of 2002, some journals publish supplements that often either cover an industry-funded conference or are "symposia" on a given topic. These supplements are often subsidized by an external sponsor with a financial interest in the outcome of research in that field; for instance, a drug manufacturer or food industry group. Such supplements can have guest editors, are often not peer-reviewed to the same standard as the journal itself, and are more likely to use promotional language. Many journals do not publish sponsored supplements. Small-circulation journals are more likely to publish supplements than large, high-prestige journals. Indications that an article was published in a supplement may be fairly subtle; for instance, a letter "s" added to a page number.
The ICMJE code of conduct specifically addresses guest-editor COIs; "Editors should publish regular disclosure statements about potential conflicts of interests related to their own commitments and those of their journal staff. Guest editors should follow these same procedures." It also states that the usual journal editor must maintain full control and responsibility and that "Editing by the funding organization should not be permitted".
The US Food and Drug Administration states that supplement articles should not be used as medical-marketing reprints but it had no legal authority to prohibit the practice.
Publishers.
Publishers may not be strongly motivated to ensure the quality of their journals. In the "Australasian Journal of Bone &amp; Joint Medicine" case, the printer Elsevier Australia put out six journal-like publications containing articles about drugs made by the Merck Group, which paid for and controlled the publications.
COIs of journal staff.
Personal conflicts of interest faced by journal staff are individual. If a person leaves the journal—unlike the COIs of journals as institutions—their personal COIs will go with them. 
, COIs of journal staff are less commonly reported than those of authors. For instance, one 2009 World Association of Medical Editors (WAME) policy document states, "Some journals list editors' competing interests on their website but this is not a standard practice". The ICMJE, however, requires that the COIs of editors and journal staff be regularly declared and published.
One 2017 Open Payments study of influential US medical journals found half of the editors received payments from industry; another study that used a different sample of editors reported two-thirds. , systems for reporting wrongdoing by editors often do not exist.
Many journals have policies limiting COIs staff can enter into; for instance, accepting gifts of travel, accommodation, or hospitality may be prohibited. , such policies are rarely published. Most journals do not offer COI training; , many journals report a desire for better guidance on COI policy.
COIs of peer reviewers.
The ICJME recommendations require peer reviewers to disclose conflicts of interest. Half to two-thirds of journals, depending on subject area, did not follow this recommendation in the first two decades of the 21st century. , if a peer reviewer fails to disclose a conflict of interest, the paper will generally not be withdrawn, corrected, or re-reviewed; the reviews, however, may be reassessed.
If peer reviewers are anonymous, their COIs cannot be published. Some experiments with publishing the names of reviewers have been undertaken; in others, the identities of reviewers were disclosed to authors, allowing authors to identify COIs. Some journals now have an open review process in which everything, including the peer reviews and the names of the reviewers, and editor and author comment, is published transparently online.
The duties of peer review may conflict with social interests or institutional loyalties; to avoid such COIs, reviewers may be excluded if they have some forms of COI, such as having collaborated with the author.
Readers of academic papers may spot errors, informally or as part of formal post-publication peer review. Academics submitting corrections to papers are often asked by the publishers to pay over 1,000 US dollars for the publication of their corrections.
COIs of article authors.
Authors of individual papers may face conflicts with their duty to report truthfully and impartially. Financial, career, political, and social interests are all sources of conflict. Authors' institutional interests become sources of conflict when the research might harm the institution's finances or offend the author's superiors.
Many journals require authors to self-declare their conflicts of interest when submitting a paper; they also ask specific questions about conflicts of interest. The questions vary substantially between journals. Author declarations, however, are rarely verified by the journal. As of 2018, "most editors say it's not their job to make sure authors reveal financial conflicts, and there are no repercussions for those who don't". Even if a conflict of interest is reported by a reader after publication, COPE does not suggest independent investigation, .
As a result, , authors often fail to declare their conflicts of interest. Rates of nondisclosure vary widely in reported studies.
The COPE retraction guidelines state, "Retractions are also used to alert readers to ... failure to disclose a major competing interest likely to influence interpretations or recommendations". , however, if an author fails to disclose a COI, the paper will usually be corrected; it will not usually be retracted. Paper retractions, notifications to superiors, and publication bans are possible. Non-disclosure incidents harm academic careers. Authors are held to have collective responsibility for the contents of an article; if one author fails to declare a conflict of interest, the peer review process may be deemed compromised and the whole paper retracted.
The publisher may charge authors substantial fees for retracting papers, even in cases of honest error, giving them a financial disincentive to correct the record.
Public registries of author COIs have been suggested. Authors face administrative burdens in declaring COIs; standardized declarations or a registry could reduce these.
Ghost authors and non-contributing authors.
Ghost authorship, where a writer contributes but is not credited, has been estimated to affect a significant proportion of the research literature. Honorary authorship, where an author is credited but did not contribute, is more common. Being named as an author on many papers is good for an academic's career. Failure to adhere to authorship standards is rarely punished. To avoid misreported authorship, a requirement that all authors describe the contribution they made to the study ("movie-style credits") has been advocated for. Ghostwriters may be legally liable for fraud.
The ICMJE criteria for authorship require that authors contribute:
The ICMJE requires that "All those designated as authors should meet all four criteria for authorship, and all who meet the four criteria should be identified as authors. Those who do not meet all four criteria should be acknowledged." Academics who have had publication ethics training and those who are aware of the ICMJE authorship criteria are more stringent in their concepts of authorship and are more likely to consider breaches of authorship as misconduct, as are more junior researchers. Awareness is low; one study found only about half of researchers had read the ICJME criteria.
COIs of study sponsors.
If a study requires outside funding, this can be a major source of conflicting interests; for instance in cases where the manufacturer of a drug is funding a study into its safety and efficacy or where the sponsor hopes to use the research to defend itself in litigation. Sponsors of a study may involve themselves in the design, execution, analysis, and write-up of a study. In extreme cases, they may carry out the research and ghostwrite the article with almost no involvement from the nominal author. Movie-style credits are advocated as a way to avoid this.
There are many opportunities for bias in trial design and trial reporting. For instance, a trial that compares a drug against the wrong dose of a competing drug may produce spuriously positive results.
In some cases, a contract with a sponsor may mean those named as investigators and authors on the papers may not have access to the trial data, control over the publication text, or the freedom to talk about their work. While authors and institutions have an interest in avoiding such contracts, it conflicts with their interest in competing for funding from potential study sponsors. Institutions that set stricter ethical standards for sponsor contracts lose contracts and funding when sponsors go elsewhere.
Sponsors have required contractual promises that the study is not reported without the sponsor's approval (gag clauses) and some have sued authors over compliance. Trials may go unpublished to keep commercial information secret or because the trial results were unfavourable. Some journals require that human trials be registered to be considered for publication; some require the declaration of any gag clauses as a conflict of interest; since 2001, some also require a statement that the authors have not agreed to a gag clause. Some journals require a promise to provide access to the original data to researchers intending to replicate the work. Some research ethics boards, universities, and national laws prohibit gag clauses. Gag clauses may not be legally enforceable if compliance would cause sufficient public harm. Non-publication has been found to be more common in industry-funded trials, contributing to publication bias.
It has been suggested that having many sponsors with different interests protects against COI-induced bias. , there was no evidence for or against this hypothesis.
Effect on conclusions of research.
There is evidence that industry funding of studies of medical devices and drugs results in these studies having more positive conclusions regarding efficacy (funding bias). A similar relationship has been found in clinical trials of surgical interventions, where industry funding leads to researchers exaggerating the positive nature of their findings. Not all studies have found a statistically significant relationship between industry funding and the study outcome.
Interests of research participants.
Chronically ill medical research participants report expectation of being told about COIs and some report they would not participate if the researcher had some sorts of COIs. With few exceptions, multiple ethical guidelines forbid researchers with a financial interest in the outcome from being involved in human trials.
The consent agreements entered into with study participants may be legally binding on the academics but not on the sponsor, unless the sponsor has a contractual commitment saying otherwise.
Ethical rules, including the Declaration of Helsinki, require the publication of results of human trials. participants in which are often motivated by a desire to improve medical knowledge. Patients may be harmed if safety data, such risks to patients, are kept secret. Duties to human-research participants can therefore conflict with interests in non-publication such as gag clauses.
Publication of COI declarations.
Some journals place COI declarations at the beginning of an article but most put it in smaller print at the end. Positioning makes a difference; if readers feel they are being manipulated from the beginning of a text, they read more critically than if the same feeling is produced at the end of a text.
According to the ICMJE, "each journal should develop standards with regard to the form the [COI] information should take and where it will be posted". It is often placed after the body of the article, just before the reference section. Some COI statements, like those of anonymous reviewers, may not be published at all. COI statements are sometimes paywalled so they are only visible to those who have paid for full text access. This is not considered ethical by the Committee on Publication Ethics.
In 2017 PubMed began including COI statements at the end of the abstract and before the body of the article after receiving complaints that because COI declarations were only included in full article texts, they often went unseen in paywalled articles. Only COI statements that are appropriately formatted and tagged by the publisher are included.
Science journalism rarely reports COI information from the academic article reported upon; in some studies, fewer than 1% of stories included COI information.
False statements of COIs.
Failure to disclose a conflict of interest may, depending on the circumstances, be considered a form of corruption or academic misconduct.

Engility

Engility Holdings, Inc. is an American publicly traded company that provides engineering and logistics services to several United States military and civilian agencies. The company based in Chantilly, Virginia was formed in 2012 as a spin-off of the services division of L-3 Communications Holdings. As of 2017, Engility reports an annual revenue of about $2 billion. On September 10, 2018, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) announced it was buying Engility for about $2.5 billion.
History.
Engility is now part of SAIC. Engility, previously known as L-3 Services, Inc., became an independent publicly traded corporation in July 2012 as part of a spin-off transaction by L-3 Communications Corporation. At the time of the spin-off, the new company was estimated to have an annual revenue of $1.6 to $2 billion and employed about 9,000 to 10,000 people. The L-3 Services Group EVP, Tony Smeraglinolo, was announced as the CEO of the new defense contractor firm. Following the spin-off from its New York-based parent company, Engility established its headquarters in Chantilly, Virginia, in the Washington metropolitan area. The new company acquired much of L-3's services business, while its former parent company retained most of the products business.
In January 2013, the Associated Press reported that Engility had paid a $5.28 million settlement to 71 former inmates of Abu Ghraib prison. The company had inherited lawsuits from L-3 Services Group which in turn had inherited them when L-3 Communications acquired Titan Corporation. The contract with the U.S. Military called for Titan to provide translators to support the personnel in the Iraqi prison.
In December 2013, Engility agreed to acquire the Andover, Massachusetts,-based Dynamics Research Corporation. Valued at $120.9 million, the deal was completed in January 2014, beginning a full integration of the two companies.
In October 2014, Engility announced that it planned to acquire another Chantilly, Virginia-based defense contractor, TASC, Inc. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and General Atlantic, the private equity firms which previously owned TASC, gained a 51% stake in Engility Holdings as part of the merger. The all-stock acquisition deal was valued at $1.1 billion. Engility completed the acquisition of its rival in February 2018 with the final price for the deal reported as $1.3 billion. After the merger, the company announced that TASC's chief executive, John Hynes, had joined Engility as the chief operating officer. The TASC brand remained in operation as a subsidiary of Engility.
Operations.
Since the spin-off from L-3, Engility has been based in Chantilly, Virginia, located in the Washington metropolitan area. In March 2013, Engility implemented a significant reduction in its auxiliary workforce, cutting about 40 percent of its accounting, human resources, and payroll departments, reducing its total of 7,800 employees by 4%. After the merger with TASC in early 2015, however, the company was estimated to employ about 11,000 people, of which 4,000 are located near the nation 's capital.
As of March 2016, the Engility appointed a former Raytheon employee Lynn Dugle as chief executive. In June 2017, the company eliminated the positions of president and COO previously held by former-TASC CEO John Hynes, who also left the company at the same time. That same month, the company won a contract from the US Air Force to consult on review and evaluation of the space vehicles and missile equipment located at Los Angeles Air Force Base. In November 2017, the US Navy granted Engility a modernization contract valued at $30 million. In March 2018, Engility reported a revenue of $1.93 billion and net loss of $35.2 million in the previous year.

2018 South Cambridgeshire District Council election

Elections to South Cambridgeshire District Council were held on Thursday 3 May 2018 as part of the 2018 United Kingdom local elections. Forty five seats, making up the whole of South Cambridgeshire District Council, were up for election in twenty six wards. The council previously had 57 members, last elected by thirds in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Following a boundary review, there has been a reduction of twelve seats to 45 and the electoral pattern has changed from election by thirds to all out elections, meaning that all seats were up for election on this occasion.
In a surprise result, the Liberal Democrats took control of the council, winning 30 seats. The district had been controlled outright by the Conservative Party since the 2007 election.
Summary.
The list of candidates was published on 6 April 2018. Both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party fielded a full slate of 45 candidates, while the Liberal Democrats contested 41 seats. The Green Party had 26 candidates, and there were seven independent candidates. The United Kingdom Independence Party stood one candidate in Bar Hill.
There was media speculation in the build-up to the election that the Liberal Democrats could make a surprise breakthrough on the council. The Guardian identified South Cambridgeshire as a district where the Conservative Party's approach to Brexit may damage the party's appeal to "Tory Remain" voters who had predominantly voted to remain in the European Union in the 2016 referendum.
During the campaign, one of the Conservative candidates for the Fen Ditton and Fulbourn ward was suspended from the party after a number of offensive posts he had made on Twitter received national media attention. However he remained on the ballot paper as the deadline for withdrawals had passed.

Louise Boitard

Louise Boitard (20 May 1907 – 4 April 2001), also known as Jeanine Boitard and Jeanine Gille, was a member of the French Resistance during the Second World War. Later a local politician, she was one of France's most decorated women.
Career in the Resistance.
Boitard, the daughter of a wine merchant, joined the Resistance in 1941, becoming known by the code name "Jeanine". She helped many people to escape from occupied France. In October 1943, she hid two small Jewish children at a farm near Lisieux. In 1944, during the invasion of Normandy, she rescued a Canadian airman, Jack Verbout, and hid him in her home. A character based on Jeanine appeared in the film "The Longest Day", played by Irina Demick. When the film was released in 1962, she travelled to Chicago to meet Verbout again.
Post-war activity.
Immediately after the war, she married , a lawyer and Resistance worker whose secretary she had been since 1940. She was a board member of the weekly publication "Liberté de Normandie". In 1945 she went to Sweden to work with childcare experts, subsequently setting up several crèches to support families separated by the war.
On 18 April 1971, Jeanine Gille became the first woman to sit on the conseil général of Calvados, in succession to her husband, who had died two months earlier. She was re-elected in 1973, but defeated by eight votes in 1979.
She was buried beside her husband in the cemetery at Poirier, in the commune of Frénouville, east of Caen. In 2015, the "square Jeanine Boitard" was named after her, in the Saint-Paul district of Caen.

55th Street Playhouse

The 55th Street Playhouse—periodically referred to as the 55th Street Cinema and Europa Theatre—was a 253-seat movie house at 154 West 55th Street, Midtown Manhattan, New York City, that opened on May 20, 1927. Many classic art and foreign-language films, including those by Jean Cocteau, Sergei Eisenstein, Federico Fellini, Abel Gance, Fritz Lang, and Orson Welles, were featured at the theater. Later, Andy Warhol presented many of his notable films (including "Flesh" (1968) and "Lonesome Cowboys" (1968) and others) in this building (as well as in other area theaters, including the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre) in the late 1960s. Other notable films were also shown at the theater, including "Boys in the Sand" (1971) and "Him" (1974).
History.
Originally, the theater was built to be a horse stable in 1888 by Charles T. Barney, a banker who later became president of the Knickerbocker Trust Company. The upper stories were rented out as The Holbein Studios, and were occupied by artists, such as John Singer Sargent, impressionist painter Childe Hassam, and portrait artist Cecilia Beaux. Later, in the late 1920s, the stable building was converted into a movie theater.
Warhol years.
As an advertisement illustrator in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s. One of the most important collaborators during this period was Gerard Malanga. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at "The Factory", Warhol's aluminum foil-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included Freddie Herko, Ondine, Ronald Tavel, Mary Woronov, Billy Name, and Brigid Berlin (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).
During the 1960s, Andy Warhol groomed a retinue of bohemian and counterculture eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation "Superstars", including Nico, Joe Dallesandro, Edie Sedgwick, Viva, Ultra Violet, Holly Woodlawn, Jackie Curtis, and Candy Darling. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some—like Berlin—remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer John Giorno and film-maker Jack Smith, also appear in Warhol films (many presented at the 55th Street Playhouse and the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre) of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time. Less well known was his support and collaboration with several teen-agers during this era, who would achieve prominence later in life including writer David Dalton, photographer Stephen Shore and artist Bibbe Hansen (mother of pop musician Beck).
Controversy.
In June 1970, the 55th Street Playhouse began showing "Censorship in Denmark: A New Approach", a film documentary study of pornography, directed by Alex de Renzy. According to Vincent Canby, a New York Times film reviewer, the narrator of the documentary noted that “pornography is more stimulating and cheaper than hormone injections” and "stresses the fact that since the legalization of pornography in Denmark, sex crimes have decreased." Nonetheless, on September 30, 1970, Assistant District Attorney, Richard Beckler, had the theater manager, Chung Louis, arrested on an obscenity charge, and the film seized as appealing to a prurient interest in sex. The presiding judge, Jack Rosenberg, stated, “[The film] is patently offensive to most Americans because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters.”
Current use.
The 55th Street Playhouse building was partly rebuilt in the 1980s, and the ground floor, at 154 West 55th Street, was altered to be a truck entrance.

<doc id="56976479" url="?curid=56976479" title="Holyoke Dam">
Holyoke Dam

The Holyoke Dam, also referred to as the Hadley Falls Dam, or Hadley Falls Station is a granite dam built to produce hydroelectric power in tandem with the Holyoke Canal System at Hadley Falls on the Connecticut River, between Holyoke and South Hadley, Massachusetts.
The current dam is the third structure to be built across the Great Falls at South Hadley. The dam, along with the Canal System and its Testing Flume, is recognized by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers as a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark for its use by Clemens Herschel in the development of the Venturi meter, the first means of measuring large-scale flows, and the McCormick-Holyoke Turbine by John B. McCormick, also known as the Hercules Turbine, which doubled the efficiency of turbines to more than 80% in its time.
Background.
The river between Holyoke and South Hadley contained what was known as the "Great Falls" a natural 53 ft drop in the river approximately 86 miles upstream of the Atlantic ocean. Following the success of the textile mills in the planned industrial city of Lowell, Massachusetts a group of investors sought to imitate this city along a natural curve in the Connecticut River. George C. Ewing a sales representative of Fairbanks and Co. marked what was then known as West Springfield, as a site for future development. By the fall of 1847 Ewing, acting as land agent for the investors involved, obtained possession of 1200 acres of land on the right bank of the Connecticut river at Hadley Falls for the purpose of establishing an industrial city. A charter was obtained from the Massachusetts Legislature in the winter of 1847-1848 under the name of the ‘Hadley Falls Co.’ with a capital of four millions of dollars. In the summer of 1848 a timber crib dam was constructed across the Connecticut River at the Great Falls. The engineer of the first two dams, as well as the layout of Holyoke's grid and canals was Philander Anderson, C.E.
First Dam.
Constructed using a timber frame the dam was filled with rubble and stone and was completed in a matter of months. Upon completion the gates were closed at 10AM and the reservoir behind the dam began to fill. As recorded in Harper's Weekly, “The engineer took great pride in his work, and when it was finished, and the gates shut down, he is said to have irreverently exclaimed: ‘There! Those gates are shut, and God Almighty himself can not open them!’” By noon the timber dam had sprung massive leaks, and the footing began to show signs of weakness at 2:00PM. The dam had not been properly secured to bedrock and at 3:20PM the dam gave way and a torrent of water, logs and debris headed downstream towards Chicopee, Massachusetts. A foreman sent a telegram to investors in Boston which read, "3:20 p.m., your dam has gone to hell by way of Willimansett."
Writing in 1929, one Arthur E. Ferry recalled the scene as he had experienced it as a child-
“Some comical things happened on the day mentioned. For instance: After the gates in the dam were closed, the water soon drained off from the river bed, and men and teams were in there getting out building stones, and many people were walking about, picking up shells and relics, until warning was shouted that they were in danger, and then there was a lively scramble to get to safety. I have in mind several Belchertown men who were in there, but especially do I remember Mr. James H. Clapp. He was a portly man and came struggling and puffing up the bank, and seeing my father and Mr. Ebenezer Warner, he reached out his hands and cried frantically, ‘Devil, Devil, Warner, help me up!’
It was a frightful scene, with such an immense body of water full of timbers plunging down end over end, and people screaming with fright.
I suppose there are few people living who saw that catastrophe, because most people die before they are as old as I am. There were but few children there, and I was not quite seven years old.”
Second Dam.
The second dam which would define the city's industrial prowess in the 19th century was completed the following year in 1849. Initially built as effectively a wall of wooden timbers, concerns eventually arose that the water's velocity pouring over the dam was eroding the rocks upon which it stood, and it was described by a paper of the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia as "simply built with the wrong face up stream", where a sloping structure in the opposite direction would have been ideal. Furthermore the vibration of the waterfall on the rocks led to synchronous vibrations in doors and windows on many of the surrounding mills and worker housing. To remedy this, from 1868 to 1870 an apron was constructed of large timbers and rocks which mitigated the aforementioned vibrations, however the angle at which it sloped and the geology of rocks immediately below only ensured that the erosion continued. As early as 1884 the Holyoke Water Power Company, manufacturers, and city officials called for the construction of an improved stone structure which would address these issues and ensure the sustainability of the hydropower in the future, a considerable undertaking at the time as the wooden dam was then the 2nd largest dam in the country at that time by length, exceeded only by the Fairmount Dam in Philadelphia. In a conference with the city's manufacturers that year, the Water Power Company announced it had begun a fund toward the development of the replacement dam, which would not see construction commence until 11 years thereafter, and completed in nearly 16.
Present structure.
Construction of the third and current dam began in 1895, with the final stone laid on January 5, 1900. At the time of its construction it employed a narrow gauge railroad for movement of base stone, as well as what was then the longest cableway in the world, suspended from either end of the Connecticut River to move stones into the higher reaches of the structure.

Aestivation hypothesis

The aestivation hypothesis is a hypothesized solution to the Fermi paradox conceived in 2017 by Anders Sandberg, Stuart Armstrong and Milan M. Ćirković. The hypothesis, published on 27 April 2017, suggests that advanced alien civilizations may be storing energy and aestivating (hibernating in times of heat instead of cold), until the universe cools to better make use of the stored energy to perform tasks.
As the universe cools, the potential work producible by stored energy can increase by a multiplier of 1030 per Landauer's principle. If the goal of an advanced civilization is to maximize the number of calculations done, to generate information processing for tasks like mass-producing simulations, then aestivation would be purposeful to achieve this end.
Intentions of alien civilizations.
Advanced alien civilizations may have other intentions. If the intent is creating large amounts of "happiness", then energy resources may be used to generate perfect computer simulations of "the maximal number of maximally happy minds". If the intent is knowledge, resources may be focused on information storage. Such civilizations may go through a time of exploration and then remain dormant until the conditions of the universe are more energetically favorable to best achieve their objectives.
Dispute.
The theory has been disputed by a subsequent paper by Charles H. Bennett, Robin Hanson and Jess Riedel, who claim the notion that more computations could be performed later in the universe's history is based on a misunderstanding of the physics of computation.

Josiah Francis, also called Francis the Prophet, native name Hillis Hadjo ("crazy-brave medicine") (c. 1770–1818), was "a charismatic religious leader" of the Red Stick Creek Indians. According to the historian Frank Owsley, he became "the most ardent advocate of war against the white man, as he believed in the supremacy of the Creek culture over that of the whites". He traveled to London as a representative of several related tribal groups, unsuccessfully seeking British support against the expansionism of the United States, then was captured and hanged by General Andrew Jackson shortly after his return to Spanish Florida.
Name.
His native name has been written with a variety of spellings in English: Hilis, Hildis, and Hidlis. His last name is found as Hadgo, Hadsho, and Haya. There are also combined forms found, such as Hillishago and Hillishager. "The English always referred to him as Hidlis Hadjo." In a letter, Andrew Jackson called him "Hillishageer".
In traditional Creek orthography, his name would be "Heles-haco" /hilis-hatʃo/ “Crazy Medicine” composed of the medicinal prefix "heles-" and the war title "haco" “crazy”.
Parents and early life.
Francis was the son of a Muscogee Creek mother and a father of European descent. Since Muscogee Creeks were matrilineal and matrilocal, Francise inherited his clan from his mother and was a citizen of the Muscogee Confederacy. Francis and others like him became military leaders, passionate defenders of the Creek cause, apparently to demonstrate their legitimacy to the full-blooded Creek. Francis refused to wear white man's clothing during his visit to New Orleans. He was a trader and metal artisan, the latter skill learned from his father, David Francis, a South Carolina frontier blacksmith and silversmith. He "lived among the Alabama and Coushatta people near the point where the Cousa and Tallapoosa Rivers joined to form the Alabama", near modern Montgomery, Alabama. Little is known about his mother or his childhood.
Francis married Hannah Moniac (Muscogee), half-sister of William Weatherford and aunt of David Moniac, the first Native American to graduate from the U. S. Military Academy at West Point. David's father and Hannah's half-brother was "the prosperous and well-known Creek businessman Samuel Moniac. She was a relative of Muscogee leader Alexander McGillivray," who led the faction of "southern" Muscogee Creeks that were more receptive to assimilation into American society as a survival technique.
Influence of Tecumseh and Seekaboo.
Tecumseh, a leader from further north, in 1811 traveled throughout the lands west of the Appalachian mountains; settlement by whites was just beginning. With some encouragement from the British, with whom he had contact in Canada, he attempted to create a pan-Indian confederation, from north to south, that could force the new Americans to remain east of the mountains. His greatest success was among the Creeks, to whom he may have been linked through one or both of his parents. (His tribal origins are not known with certainty.) His credibility was enhanced by the New Madrid earthquakes and the Great Comet of 1811. Among the Creeks, his greatest influence was on Francis. Although Tecumseh's visit was brief, and he was widely credited later with incendiary speeches now believed to be forgeries by whites, he left behind his partner the prophet Seekaboo (also spelled Sukaboo). One source says that he was a Shawnee, another that he was probably a Creek. Francis had extensive conversations with him. "The first recorded public fact of his life is being created a prophet, which was about the latter part of 1812. It took Sukaboo, the great Shawnee prophet, ten days' work to endow Francis with prophetic powers. When that was completed, Francis was considered the greatest prophet in the Creek Nation. He himself now assumed the role of prophet-maker, [and] made many prophets."
Red Stick leader.
Francis, as Prophet, was a leader of the Red Stick ("northern") faction of the Creek Indians, who opposed American expansion into their lands. He "hated the white man and his culture." He particularly disapproved of the husbandry of domestic animals, to the point of slaughtering his own (and burning his house) when he decided, about 1812, to give up the ways of whites. He began to have visions "and began to preach with the fervor of a new convert." He founded a new village, Holy Ground, on a bluff above the Alabama River. Opposition by the "Lower", or southern, Creeks, who favored accommodation to the whites led to civil war, without a clear victor. Francis, who was called later "the principal instigator of this Creek war", led the attack on Fort Sinquefield, killing at least 13, two days after his Red Stick allies Peter McQueen and William Weatherford attacked Fort Mims in which over 250 men, women, and children were slain. The U.S. response did not take long in arriving, additional troops having been assembled. The U.S won a decisive victory over the Creeks in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814). Francis and some 1000 other Red Sticks and their allies fled to northern Florida, into the semi-wilderness of the Florida panhandle, where they soon aligned with British forces, which openly recruited Indian allies, and became known as Seminoles. At the center of the wilderness was the strong new fort at Prospect Bluff, where Francis and Peter McQueen both wore British uniforms. It was built by the British after their defeats at the Battle of New Orleans and the Battle of Pensacola (1814) and intended as a base for operations against the southern United States. There were so many Creek refugees there ("virtually the entire surviving population of Redsticks") that famine was a real concern; the British were unprepared for that number of refugees. No food was available for purchase, and crops couldn't be raised without months of delay. Food had to be brought in from other British posts.
Trip to England.
When Colonel Edward Nicolls, the commander at Prospect Bluff, was returning to England, after the end of the War of 1812 in February 1815, he took Francis with him, as Francis insisted on (and Nicolls discouraged). Before leaving, Francis disposed of the eight slaves he had, probably the same eight his daughter later claimed. The purpose was to get British agreement to the Treaty of Nicolls' Outpost, which Nicolls, on his own initiative and without authorization (in fact, the British knew nothing of it until Nicolls and Francis arrived in England), had negotiated between the Creek Indians and the British Crown. The Treaty recognized the Native Americans as subjects of the Crown, that is, as British citizens. Francis took his son Earle with him, hoping the son could stay and get some education. A fascinating document that has just come to light (a listing of crown expenditures on Francis's behalf) reveals that besides his son, he was accompanied by a servant and an interpreter. (This conflicts with reports elsewhere that Francis was fluent in English and Spanish, as well as "Alabama" and "Muscogee".) Arriving in England on August 14, 1815, he stayed with Colonel Nicolls at his home near Eltham, Kent (near London). "Nicolls found it necessary to support the Indians [Francis and his son Earle] from his own funds, even to the point of buying them winter clothes." Francis was forbidden from travelling back to Florida until December 30, 1816, which was ordered by Earl Bathurst to prevent the visit from causing tensions with the United States after the Treaty of Ghent. Earle remained in England, and Col. Nicolls made several requests for a subsidy for the boy's keep and education, but his requests were to no avail. There is no record as to what ultimately happened to the boy. The government representative in charge of American policy, Earl Bathurst, refused to see him until a year had gone by, and the meeting was to tell Francis the Creeks should make peace with the Americans, as he could give no support if another war between the two parties occurred in the future . Nicolls was chastised for exceeding his authority; he was posted, apparently as punishment, to remote Ascension Island, and later to Fernando Po. Bathurst gave Francis "a brace of pistols", a commission as a brigadier general, and sent him home but not without Francis meeting several prominent people, the story of which has not been written. A hint of it is in this report in the American press:
 His shoulder bag is in the British Museum. Also in the British Museum are "a long hunting shirt of deer skin, moccasins, leggings and a belt". The following spring he received £200 of "clothing and agricultural implements" of which a list has survived.
Hanging by Andrew Jackson.
Francis arrived at Nassau, Bahamas in January 1817, where the governor, by order of Lord Bathurst, gave him another £100 in cash. He returned to Florida in 1817 to settle at his new home on the Wakulla River, near the fort San Marcos de Apalache (modern St. Marks, Florida). His daughter Milly Francis in 1818 famously rescued a U.S. soldier, Douglas McCrimmon, who had been captured by the Indians, a story that received national newspaper publicity. After his release, McCrimmon told General Andrew Jackson in person (Jackson was on a ship off St. Marks) that Francis, the leader of the Sinquefield massacre, was nearby. Jackson lured Francis aboard the U.S. schooner "Thomas Shields" by falsely flying a British flag. He was placed in irons and immediately hanged at St. Marks by Jackson, without a court-martial or any other legal proceeding, in sharp contrast with the "court of inquiry" he set up in the Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident. His daughter witnessed his hanging, and later turned down McCrimmon's offer of marriage, possibly as a result of the capture.

Her debut album of Strauss Lieder titled 'Through Life and Love' with pianist Joseph Middleton, was released in July 2017 with Orchid Classics.
Early life.
Louise Alder was born in London and grew up in a family of musicians, playing the violin from an early age. Her father is a singer and her mother a violinist. She was a member of the London Schools Symphony Orchestra and also danced as a child.
Career.
Alder was educated at Lady Margaret School in Parsons Green, Fulham, London, followed by the University of Edinburgh, graduating with First Class Honours to join the Royal College of Music's International Opera School where she was the inaugural Kiri Te Kanawa scholar.
Alder received her first career break jumping in as Sophie in Der Rosenkavalier for Glyndebourne Festival Opera at the BBC Proms in 2014, where critics noted she was 'a sparkling Sophie who won all hearts' (Barry Millington, Evening Standard) and that she 'confirmed that she's ready for top billing' (Kimon Daltas, The Arts Desk). Since then Der Rosenkavalier has become something of a calling card for her, performing it at Oper Frankfurt (2016), Welsh National Opera (2017) and Glyndebourne Festival Opera (2018).
She has been a member of the solo ensemble at Oper Frankfurt since 2014, when she jumped in again to sing Gretel in a new production of Hänsel und Gretel directed by Keith Warner and conducted by Sebastian Weigle to notable acclaim. Other highlights there have included Susanna (Le Nozze di Figaro), Gilda (Rigoletto), Vixen (Cunning Little Vixen), Sophie (Werther), Sophie (Der Rosenkavalier) and Cleopatra (Giulio Cesare in Egitto). Elsewhere she has sung with Glyndebourne Festival Opera, The Royal Opera, Garsington and Welsh National Opera.
She performs recitals regularly at the Wigmore Hall with pianists Gary Matthewman, Joseph Middleton and James Baillieu and in concert halls all over the world, working with conductors such as Ivor Bolton, Sir Mark Elder, Robin Ticciati, Sebastian Weigle, Lorenzo Viotti, Jakub Hrůša, Christoph Rousset, Richard Egarr, Sir Richard Armstrong, Harry Bickett and Johannes Debus.
A passionate Handel singer, Alder sang the title role in Semele on tour with Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in 2017, Atalanta in a new production of Xerxes at Oper Frankfurt also in 2017, the title role in Theodora at the BBC Proms in 2018 and Romilda (Xerxes) at Oper Frankfurt in January 2019.

Andrew Pollack

Andrew Scott Pollack (born February 18, 1966) is an American author, school safety activist, and entrepreneur whose daughter Meadow was killed in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018.
Pollack is credited with helping to pass the "Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act" (Florida Senate Bill: 7026). He has met with President Donald Trump and his cabinet, Florida governor Rick Scott, and many lawmakers. Pollack is actively fighting to release more federal funding to increase school security in every school across the nation. He believes that bulletproof glass, metal detectors, enhanced door lock systems, ID checkpoints, and "school marshals" can help prevent school shootings.
On September 10, 2019, Pollack released his book, "Why Meadow Died: The People and Policies That Created The Parkland Shooter and Endanger America's Students," alongside education expert and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, Max Eden.
Pollack spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention.
Personal life and family.
Pollack was born in the New York City borough of Queens, the son of Evelyn (Silverberg), a secretary, and Arnold Pollack, a dentist. Pollack's paternal grandfather was a Russian Jewish immigrant who came to the U.S. in 1933 and married a Polish Jewish immigrant seamstress. Pollack grew up in Oceanside, New York and graduated from Oceanside High School in 1984.
Pollack has three children from his first marriage to Shara Kaplan, sons Huck and Hunter and daughter Meadow. In 1999, Pollack and his family moved from New York City to Coral Springs, Florida, to be closer to Pollack's parents who moved to Florida for their retirement years. Pollack and Kaplan divorced in 2010, and Pollack married Julie Phillips around 2014.
After briefly attending Sullivan County Community College, Pollack opened a debris cleanup business with a high school friend. Pollack later moved to New York City in 1989 and started a scrap metal purchasing business.
Upon moving to Florida, Pollack became a youth lacrosse coach and partnered with his neighbor to invest in real estate.
Meadow Pollack.
Meadow Jade Pollack (October 5, 1999 – February 14, 2018) was the daughter of Andrew Pollack and Shara Kaplan. She was named after Meadow Soprano, a character on "The Sopranos". A senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, she was murdered in the February 14, 2018 shooting. Meadow was shot nine times and had attempted to avoid the shooter while struggling to get into a classroom. Teachers and students were not able to open the classroom door. Her father told CBN that as the shooter returned, Meadow covered another student (who died in the shooting) in an attempt to protect her. She was then shot five more times, killing her and the other student she shielded, Cara Loughran, a freshman.
Meadow's death prompted her father to found Meadow's Movement, a movement fighting for increased school security to prevent future school massacres.
Meadow had planned to attend Lynn University. 
Activism.
On February 21, 2018, Andrew and his two sons attended a White House listening session hosted by President Donald Trump that consisted of siblings and friends of slain victims along with survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. He spoke extensively on the topic of school security, claiming that schools do not have the same level of security as airports, stadiums, and embassies. Pollack raised that the September 11 attacks happened once and that measures were put in place to prevent it from ever happening again, also stating "There should have been one school shooting, and we should have fixed it!"
Governor-elect of Florida Ron DeSantis, a Republican, included both Andrew and Hunter on his Transition Advisory Committee on Public Safety.

Ryan Petty

Ryan Blaine Petty (born January 15, 1970) is an American school safety activist. His 14-year-old daughter Alaina Petty was killed in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting on February 14, 2018. Petty is credited with helping to pass the "Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act" Florida Senate Bill 7026 just three weeks after his daughter Alaina was murdered. At the federal level, Petty worked with Senators Orrin Hatch, Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson to pass the STOP School Violence Act and the Fix NICS Act of 2017. He has met frequently with Florida governor Rick Scott, and many federal lawmakers.
Political activism and career.
Ryan Petty ran for Broward County School Board in 2018, narrowly losing in the primary to incumbent Donna Korn. In an unusual turn of events, Petty was endorsed by two sitting U.S. Senators Orrin Hatch and Marco Rubio, unusual for a local school board race. Senator Rubio credited Petty for his work to improve school safety and his help in passing the STOP School Violence Act.
Governor-elect of Florida Ron DeSantis, a Republican, included Petty on his Transition Advisory Committee on Public Safety.
Activism.
In February 2018, Ryan and his son Patrick Petty accompanied Governor Rick Scott to Tallahassee to speak to the Florida House and Senate about the impact to their family of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and the need for legislative reform targeted at improving school safety. Petty spoke to both chambers asking them to set aside political differences to make our schools safe. "If this evolves into a gun control debate, we are going to miss our opportunity to get something done," Petty said. "[The] message is simple, this time must be different we have an opportunity to get our schools secure." Petty has been praised for his ability to work across the aisle to tackle the issue of school shootings in the United States, meeting with lawmakers and other officials in Florida and Washington, D.C.
In April 2018, Petty and his wife Kelly launched a nonprofit organization, The WalkUp Foundation; which is dedicated to improving the culture in our public schools by funding programs that influence engagement within the student body. The WalkUp Foundation also funds early identification &amp; threat assessment programs, which has been demonstrated to help prevent acts of school violence. In partnership with the U.S. Secret Service and The Columbia Lighthouse Project at Columbia University, The WalkUp Foundation is working to ensure that school districts are equipped with best practices and training for proactive threat assessment.

Hapton Valley Colliery

Hapton Valley Colliery was a coal mine on the edge of Hapton near Burnley in Lancashire, England. Its first shafts were sunk in the early 1850s and it had a life of almost 130 years, surviving to be the last deep mine operating on the Burnley Coalfield.
Geology.
The Burnley Coalfield, separated from the South Lancashire Coalfield, is in the form of an oval bowl extending north-east from Blackburn, past Colne to the Pennine Hills. Bounded by the Pendle monocline to the north and the Rossendale Valley anticline to the south, the coalfield is dissected by a series of predominately north-westerly trending faults, the most significant fault is the Cliviger Valley Fault at Burnley with a throw of up to in Cliviger valley. The intersecting Theiveley Lead Mine Fault is one of a smaller number of easterly aligned structures. Unlike South Lancashire, only the Lower Westphalian coal measures are available. The hills above are formed of Carboniferous sandstones, ranging from millstone grits to finer grained stone such as the Dyneley Knott flags and the Dandy Mine Rock. The drift cover consists primarily of glacial till deposits, which cause poor-drainage soils.
Hapton Valley worked the Upper Mountain and Lower Mountain / Union seams in a syncline that extends from the Thieveley Fault, north-west to Higham where it outcrops. The area is split centrally by the Deerplay Fault with a throw of up to , which runs from White Hill (near Crown Point), under the eastern side of Hameldon Hill and Burnley's Lowerhouse district. The coal extracted from the Upper and Lower Mountain seams was ideal for producing high grade metallurgical coke which was in high demand in industry.
Early history.
Beginning in 1853 at Spa Wood, two shafts where sunk to a depth of for the Exors of John Hargreaves Ltd. The site was on a spit of land between Hapton and Habergham Cloughs, just south of where they combine to form Green Brook. The shafts were on the north-west side of the Deerplay fault and although the Lower Mountain mine was reached, the pit was sunk in an area where it merges with the Upper Foot mine. The difficult geological conditions led to both shafts being partially filled, and the Upper Mountain mine being worked. Coal was transported underground, raised to the surface and delivered onwards on a network of tram roads, known locally as ginny roads or tracks, by wheeled iron tubs drawn by an endless-chain system which was driven by a stationary steam engine. The tubs ran along circuits made of 22 inch gauge, angle-iron tracks but as the seam only averaged in height, shorter tubs with half the capacity were used underground. Two drifts cut into the hillside connected the underground system to the surface and provided access for the miners.
On the surface, the ginny track delivered the coal to a coking plant at Barclay Hills Colliery to the northeast, and ultimately connected to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Gannow in Burnley. By 1868, the underground tracks had reached and in length and about 370 tonnes of coal per day was raised. but sometime later, problems with faulting and water ingress led to mining being stopped.
Expansion.
In the 1880s the shafts were increased in diameter and larger pumping equipment was installed and mining resumed by 1890. The horizontal, condensing steam engine powered four bucket-lifts but a system of specially designed automatic fill and empty barrels was also employed to raise 1,000,000 gallons of water per day from the workings. By 1908 work had commenced on two new shafts (No. 3 and No. 4) 200 metres north-west. They were completed to a depth of by 1910. Manpower was transferred from the old site, with Spa Pit (No.1) closing in 1935. No. 2 shaft continued to be used for pumping. In the early 1940s a small surface drift was driven from Thorney Bank Clough behind the Hapton Inn to speed-up access for the miners.
Later years.
After nationalisation in 1947, the National Coal Board decided to develop Thorny Bank Colliery to the west which began operation in 1952, utilising the Thorney Bank Clough drift for ventilation. They still saw a future for Hapton Valley, and investment followed, moving its area of operation to the east. In the early 1950s new tub circuits with an increased capacity were installed and work on new drifts heading east from the pit bottom, cutting through the Deerplay Fault, was completed in 1954. The same year a 3300 volt, 200 horsepower electric winder replaced the old steam-driven one. In October 1957, work had to be stopped for several months on one of the new eastern faces after only two weeks in operation because of water ingress estimated at between 700 and 800 gallons per minute. Pumping equipment costing £10,000 was required to bring the problem under control.
The ginny track system came to an end for the transport of coal in 1958 when it was replaced by a system of conveyors. In 1961 one final surface drift was cut and future operations were mechanised.
In 1962 the colliery employed 67 on the surface and 386 men below ground working two faces in the Union seam where production had increased to approximately 700 tons per day. No. 3 shaft was the main winding shaft, No. 4 was equipped with an electrically-driven exhausting fan and used for winding men only. A second exhaust fan was located about half a mile along the main return airway but its use was discontinued after the completion of the surface drift. The method employed at the time (longwall mining) involved digging two tunnels at either side of the coal face, the intake and return gates, for access and ventilation. To facilitate the placement of a conveyor and electric cutting machine, recesses were cut into each end of the face, known as stables. As the coal was removed and the conveyor advanced, the waste rock was packed into each side of the void and the props removed to allow the roof to cave-in in a controlled manner. The primary means of breaking rock and coal was explosive shot cartridges detonated in a series of boreholes. A coal plough was used in the Upper Mountain mine and an Anderton Shearer Loader in the Union. In 1978–79, the colliery's most productive year, 237,425 tonnes of coal were raised.
Closure.
Hapton Valley survived to be Burnley's last deep mine, operating into the 1980s. By this time the risks associated with mining near flooded workings was considered too great and Hapton Valley Colliery was closed on 26 April 1982. The winding gear was demolished at the start of 1983 but many surface buildings survived and the surface drift and shafts were capped. It has been estimated that the proximity of the Deerplay fault, which created a 450-metre-wide barren zone, effectively reduced the exploitable reserves by 1,500,000 tons.
Incidents.
A warning of the dangers of mining occurred in 1855, when a 14-year-old boy was killed and his two companions injured by an explosion that occurred when they entered one of the old workings using a candle for light. The seams worked at Hapton Valley were "gassy", with very high levels of firedamp recorded at the face. Although the use of powerful ventilation may have been linked to an increased occurrence of pneumoconiosis (miner's lung) in the Burnley Coalfield, no major explosions were recorded in the district until the 1960s. Occasional serious incidents had occurred such as the 1856 death of a banksman who was repairing the steam engine, and a fire which destroyed the winding house in 1908.
Two ignitions of gas occurred at number one coal face during the summer of 1960 and work there was subsequently discontinued. A third ignition occurred in the return gate stable on number two face on 4 April 1961. Then just after 9:45AM on 22 March 1962, an explosion in number two district killed 16 men instantly and 3 of the 16 seriously injured men died in hospital. The official report stated that the explosion likely caused by a firedamp ignition, possibly combined with coal dust, originating either in the return gate stable or at a point in the return gate between from the face. While the ignition was probably the result of shotfiring, or from a flash produced by a thermite reaction involving aluminium foil and rusty iron, the source of the gas was not conclusively identified. The victims are remembered with plaques at St Mark's Church on Rossendale Road, and at Burnley Miners Club, which holds an annual reunion.

Hot Peaches

Hot Peaches was a drag theatre company in New York City that would put on a play a week, active from the 1970s-1990s. Hot Peaches was founded by Jimmy Camicia in 1972, who encountered a group of drag queens and began writing work for them to perform.
Description.
Their work has been described as "political camp, dominated by drag". Hot Peaches was instrumental in the development of the WOW Café, performing there frequently and informing the culture and aesthetic of the space.
Early work.
The early work of the company often created their performances around the fashion and outfits its performers wanted to wear. Reviewers in the early 1970s noted that the work seemed to be an excuse for company members to perform in drag. This became an important aspect of the company, serving as an environment for people to perform who they were and who they wanted to be.
Camicia has been quoted as saying "We're not actors, we're entertainers. Rather than becoming the script, the script becomes us."

Hisham al-Hashimi

Hisham al-Hashimi (; 9 May 1973 – 6 July 2020) was an Iraqi historian and researcher in security and strategic affairs and extremist groups, and a specialist on the subject of the Islamic state and its supporters. He also was an advisor to the Iraqi government on counter-terrorism.
Biography.
Al-Hashimi born in 1973 in Baghdad. He became a historian and researcher in security and strategic affairs. He has been a follower of the Iraqi Islamic groups since 1997. He has worked in the field of modern and "jurisprudential" manuscripts, although his academic achievement was Bachelor of Economics and Administration - Statistics Department. He held a scientific degree in "Hadith", and had an interest in the history of Al-Dhahabi. He was arrested and sentenced to prison by Saddam Hussein's regime, due to his affiliation with Salafi jihadism, then he was released from prison in 2002. After 2003, he went to work in the press, began writing reports and documents with foreign newspapers and channels, and began writing a blog about the map of armed groups in Iraq. On 1 July 2020, he published a report titled "The internal dispute within the Popular Mobilization Forces", his last work before his assassination.
Assassination.
On 6 July 2020, he was seriously wounded outside his home in Zayouna, Baghdad by two unidentified gunmen on a motorcycle. He died in the nearby Ibn Al-Nafees hospital shortly after arrival. in July 2020, a BBC investigation said Kata'ib Hezbollah was implicated in al-Hashimi's death.
He was buried at Wadi-us-Salaam, Al-Najaf, Iraq.
Aftermath.
His death triggered a national uproar in Iraq and among the larger international community, leading to allegations accusing paramilitary groups such as Kata'ib Hezbollah and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, while the official investigation has not accused any group, and no group has claimed responsibility. However, Al-Hashimi has reportedly received direct death and kidnapping threats from members and commanders within Kata'ib Hezbollah and the Popular Mobilization Forces.
In July 2021, four men were arrested including Ahmed Hamdawi Owayid Kinani who confessed that he assassinated al-Hashimi with a licensed gun, as he had previously worked in the Ministry of Interior.

Geely Yuanjing

The Geely Yuanjing sedan is a four-door compact sedan produced by the Chinese automaker Geely under the Yuanjing or Vision product series. It is the first commercial car produced by Geely Automobiles. The car was first introduced in 2006. It carries the first CVVT engine designed and made in China. The car was named Geely Tiger, Biaowang and Luhu, but it later renamed "Vision" (远景, Yuǎn jǐng). 
Geely Yuanjing went on sale on May 18, 2007 after being adjusted by Magna Steyr.
Geely Haijing (Englon Haijing) was based on SMA Haijing, which designed similar to first generation Geely Yuanjing. It carries 6-speed tiptronic transmission or 5-speed automatic transmission which is the same as Geely Yuanjing.
First Generation (FC1,2007-2013).
The first Generation of Geely Yuanjing went on sale on May 18, 2007 after being adjusted by Magna Steyr. Originally named the Geely FC, the compact sedan was later renamed to Geely Yuanjing (Vision) sedan under the Yuanjing (Vision) product series as opposed to the Geely Emgrand (EC7) sedan of the Geely Emgrand product series (Previously a separate sub-brand of Geely). It set its opposite as Hyundai Elantra, which was being sold better than most models in China.
Styling.
Styling of the Geely Yuanjing throughout the generations remains similar as the second and third generation cars were extensive facelifts of the first. The original Geely Yuanjing was criticized for resembling the Toyota Corolla (E120), as the Yuanjing was developed benchmarking the compact sedan from Toyota. Most of the early Geely products have the tendency of resembling Toyota products as reverse engineering took a huge part in Geely's past.
Technology.
Geely Yuanjing carries the most advanced engine produced by Chinese manufacturers at the time, providing ABS and EBD systems for all models.
Geely Haijing.
Geely Haijing, which was developed from SMA Haijing, is one of the flagship commercial automobile produced by Chinese car manufacturer Geely. It was introduced in 2009 by Shanghai Maple Motors, later renamed Englon SC7 or Englon Haijing. The Haijing equipped 2 front parking sensors and 4 rear parking sensors. The high match models are powered with 1.8T engine with 6-speed automatic transmission produced by Australian gearbox manufacturer Drivetrain Systems International.
Second Generation (FC2, GLEagle GC7,2014-2017).
The Geely Yuanjing sedan went through a few facelifts with code names FC, FC2, and the FC3 launched in late 2017. The side profile closely resembles the Toyota Corolla from the 2000s throughout the FC, FC2, and FC3 facelifts. The FC2 has completely redesigned front and rear DRGs which requires new front and rear fenders. However, the rest of the vehicle especially the side profile remains unchanged due to the base being the old FC platform. The FC2 is sometimes referred as the second generation Geely Yuanjing or Geely Yuanjing II.
Third Generation (FC3,2018-).
The second facelift was done in late 2017, code-named the FC3. Just like the previous facelift, the platform remains unchanged, and this time the old front and rear fenders of the FC2 were also preserved as the edge of the front and tail lamps remains unchanged. Changes on the front are subtile while the tail lamp was redesigned to be positioned horizontally and keeping the original boundaries of the FC2 generation, the rear license plate was also moved downwards onto the rear bumper. The FC3 is sometimes referred to as the third generation Geely Yuanjing or Geely Yuanjing III.

2-Ethoxyethyl acetate

2-Ethoxyethyl acetate is an organic compound with the formula CH3CH2OCH2CH2O2CCH3. It is the ester of ethoxyethanol and acetic acid. A colorless liquid, it is partially soluble in water. 
Properties.
2-Ethoxyethyl acetate is a liquid at room temperature that is used as a solvent. It can be absorbed through inhalation, ingestion, and dermally and should be avoided. It may form an explosive mixture with air. It is also incompatible with strong acids, strong alkalis and nitrates. It may form unstable peroxides and it can soften many plastics, attack plastics, rubber and coatings.
Uses.
2-Ethoxyethyl acetate has been used to dissolve polyester and short oil alkyd resins. It has also been used in coatings, dyes, insecticides, soaps and cosmetics. It is also a solvent for nitro-cellulose and is being used for the same applications as ethyl glycol
In automobile lacquers it has been used to reduce evaporation and to impart a high gloss.
Metabolism.
2-Ethoxyethyl acetate is rapidly metabolized to 2-ethoxyethanol in the blood via hydrolysis. Then, 2-ethoxyethanol is metabolized, mainly by alcohol dehydrogenase, to 2-ethoxyacetaldehyde, which is further metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to 2-ethoxyacetic acid (2-EAA) in the liver. These two compounds are the likely active metabolites, which are thought to be involved in some of the toxic effects. Also in the liver, ethylene glycol is produced. All this reactions belong to the phase I of the biotransformation process. In rats, EAA can be conjugated with glycine or may suffer O-deethylated. After this, it can be metabolized to carbon dioxide. An extra pathway in these animals involves microsomal P450 mixed function oxidases, with deethylation producing acetaldehyde and ethylene glycol.
Safety.
2-Ethoxyethyl acetate can cause a slight skin and eye irritation after exposure. High exposure can lead to kidney damage and paralysis. In animals, reproductive and teratogenic effects have been observed.

Carl Elsener Sr.

Carl Elsener Sr. (also known as Charles Elsener, born 6 July 1922 in Ibach, † 1 June 2013 in Schwyz) was a Swiss entrepreneur.
Life.
Carl Elsener was the grandson of Karl Elsener (1860-1918) and the son of Carl Elsener (1886-1950). Karl Elsener had opened a factory in Ibach for the production of knives and surgical instruments, from which the knife factory Victorinox developed.
Carl Elsener led the company initially with his father and his brother Eduard Elsener (b. 1926). After the death of his father in 1950, he took over the management. The Swiss Army Knife is considered to be one of his works.
Under the leadership of Carl Elsener Sr., the Messerfabrik became the largest company in the canton of Schwyz. In 1938, Elsener joined the company, which at the time had employed 80 people. At the time of his death, there was well over a thousand employees. Elsener is described as a boss who was able to operate almost all the machines himself, who was traveling in the "Lismerli" or in the blue work coat and who cycled to the factory. He never owned a car. A few years before his death, he felt healthy enough to put in an 80-hour week.
In October 2000, Elsner founded together with his brother Eduard Elsener and his son Carl Elsener Jr. as a successor solution, the Victorinox Foundation to ensure the continued existence and further prosperity of the company. The Foundation holds 75 percent of the shares of Victorinox AG, another 15 percent belong to the non-profit Carl u. Elise Elsener-Gut Foundation. The Elsener family owns 10 percent of the shares.
After Carl Elsener Sr. died, his son Carl Elsener Jr. (* 1958) has been managing the company since 2007.

Hashknife Hartley

Hashknife Hartley is an American old-time radio Western program. It was broadcast on the Mutual Broadcasting System from July 2, 1950, until December 30, 1951.
Schedule.
"Hashknife Hartley" began as a summer replacement series, filling the time slot of "Juvenile Jury". Paired with "Hopalong Cassidy" in the following half-hour, the substitution gave Mutual a one-hour Western block on Sunday afternoons. In September 1950, the block was extended to 90 minutes when "Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders" was added in the half-hour before "Hashknife Hartley".
Format.
The program featured the adventures of Hashknife Hartley and Sleepy Stevens, characters created by W.C. Tuttle, who served as narrator. Hartley was a western detective, and Stevens was his sidekick; the pair traveled around the old West, solving crimes in various towns.
"Hashknife".
The word "hashknife" has two meanings in the context of western adventures.
A hashknife was a tool that camp cooks used to slice beef cubes in preparation for making corned beef hash. That implement also was the basis for a cattle brand that was designed to foil rustlers by making it difficult to superimpose a new brand over the existing brand. The Vandevert family, which developed the brand, became known as "the Hashknife Outfit", and in turn that group inspired the printed stories and the radio program.
Personnel.
Frank Martin in the title role and Barton Yarborough as Stevens had the only two regular roles in the series. Don McCall was the announcer. Tom Hargis was the producer and director. Writers Fred Luke and Burt Kennedy adapted Tuttle's stories into scripts.

My Dear Melancholy

My Dear Melancholy (stylized as My Dear Melancholy,) is the first extended play by Canadian singer and songwriter the Weeknd. It was released on March 30, 2018, through XO and distributed by Republic Records. Primarily produced by Frank Dukes, who serves as an executive producer alongside the Weeknd, it features contributions from Gesaffelstein, as well as Mike Will Made It, DaHeala, Skrillex and Daft Punk's Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, among others.
"My Dear Melancholy" has been described as a return to the darker style of the Weeknd's earlier work, such as "Trilogy" (2012) and "Kiss Land" (2013). The EP was supported by the lead single, "Call Out My Name". It received generally favourable reviews and debuted at number one on the US "Billboard" 200.
Background and release.
On March 3, 2018, American rapper Travis Scott teased a new album by the Weeknd on Twitter, referring to it as "scary", and comparing it to when he "first heard" his music. Later that month, the Weeknd suggested that he was in the finishing stages of completing a new project, sharing multiple silent videos on Instagram of a recording studio, with the caption "mastering". This followed several months of in-studio pictures shared on the platform.
On March 28, the Weeknd teased the release of a new project, posting a screenshot of a text-message conversation between creative director La Mar Taylor and himself, concerning whether or not they should "drop [a new project on] Friday". The next day he announced the project to be released that night, sharing its cover art and title. On February 22, he had previously shared an image of the album's title written on a notepad.
Following the album's release, vertically-orientated music videos for "Call Out My Name" and "Try Me" were released exclusively through Spotify.
Music and lyrics.
The project has been described as "darker" than the Weeknd's previous studio releases "Beauty Behind the Madness" and "Starboy", and has been described as a return to his earlier work though with more electronic music based production with Israel Daramola from "Spin" describing it as him "returning to the darkened drug den sounds of his earlier work". "My Dear Melancholy" is characterized as an alternative R&amp;B, R&amp;B and electropop project with production credits from Skrillex and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo from Daft Punk. "My Dear Melancholy"s only feature is techno artist Gesaffelstein who produced the tracks "I Was Never There" and "Hurt You".
Lyrically, "My Dear Melancholy" focuses on heartbreak and anger related to a breakup. The lyrics focus around the Weeknd's past relationships, mainly with model Bella Hadid and singer Selena Gomez, the latter being highly publicized. The theme is a complete change from the Weeknd's past two projects which were pop-based and more mainstream. The Weeknd sings in relation to Gomez's kidney transplant operation and her relationship with Justin Bieber with CNN's Lisa Respers France labelling Gomez as the Weeknd's "muse". The Weeknd reworks Gomez's lyrics from the song "Same Old Love" on the song "Wasted Times" in a way that "Billboard" described as "tormenting".
Critical reception.
"My Dear Melancholy" was met with generally favourable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 63, based on 16 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 5.7 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.
Alex Petridis of "The Guardian" stated that "My Dear Melancholy" "abandons the pick'n'mix and indeed hit-and-miss approach of previous album "Starboy" in favour of something more cohesive: uniformly downbeat and twilit, it flows really well", but criticized its lyrical content. In a positive review, Ryan B. Patrick of "Exclaim!" commented that the project serves "as a soft reset of sorts, a musical palette cleanser that takes stock of what the Weeknd has accomplished thus far". For "NME", Jordan Bassett called the album "thrilling", praising its tight and concise nature and "notable moments of stylistic brilliance" evident in Gesaffelstein's contributions, however criticizing its lack of character, nothing that the Weeknd's predictability has led to his "impact [becoming] increasingly scattershot". Online publication "HipHopDX" commented that the EP "doesn't break any new ground, and — as he's done in the past — revisits elements of previous projects. However, without the bloated tracklist of "Starboy", and any attempt to please an audience outside of his core, the lack of innovation doesn't seem take away from the concise, focused, conceptual nature of this well-produced R&amp;B gem".
In a mixed review for "Pitchfork", Larry Fitzmaurice wrote that the project "finds him in limbo between the bleary-eyed vibe of his early mixtapes and the bulletproof pop stylings of his last two albums", praising the album's production and "Tesfaye's still-sharp ear for cool, contemporary sounds", but criticizing similarities to his earlier work – specifically between "Call Out My Name" and "Earned It", as well as "Hurt You" and "I Feel It Coming" – and concluding that "it's too early in this stage of Tesfaye's career to so obviously attempt to replicate past glories". Israel Daramola of "Spin" criticized the album's lyrics as "mopey" and "whiny", and its production as "endlessly sludgy and murky", writing that the album "is incredibly self-involved and self-pitying, nothing but surface-level introspection that shows a lot of emotion but none of it in the service of anything but the singer's ego".
Commercial performance.
"My Dear Melancholy" was streamed more than 26 million times on its first day of release on Apple Music, double the amount of streams that were obtained on Spotify according to Republic Records, though Spotify claims that "My Dear Melancholy" was able to rake up 29 million streams in 24 hours. The EP was projected to move between 165,000-180,000 album-equivalent units first week and eventually moved 169,000 album-equivalent units with 68,000 being pure sales, hitting number one on the US "Billboard" 200. "My Dear Melancholy" was also the shortest album, by track count, to top the "Billboard" 200 in eight years, a feat previously done by "". As of July 2018, it has sold 117,000 copies in the US.

National Party of Australia leadership elections

The leader of the National Party of Australia (former the Australian Country Party and National Country Party) is elected by majority vote of the federal parliamentary party. A deputy leader is elected in the same fashion. The party's longest-serving leader is Earle Page, who held the office from 1921 to 1939. It is historically rare for the incumbent leader and deputy leader to be opposed in a bid for re-election.
In every instance when an incumbent leader retires he is always succeeded by his deputy. With the exception of the election of Ian Sinclair in 1984, every one of these deputy leaders ascended to the leadership unopposed.
2016.
On 11 February 2016, National Party leader, Warren Truss announced his intention to retire at the 2016 federal election would immediately stand aside as Leader of The Nationals. Truss's deputy Barnaby Joyce, was elected unopposed as Truss' replacement, with Fiona Nash as his deputy. Consequently, Joyce was then sworn in as Deputy Prime Minister of Australia on 18 February 2016.
2018.
On 26 February 2018, the Nationals held a party room meeting at which Barnaby Joyce formally resigned to the backbench. Michael McCormack was seen as the favourite to become leader, and was the only declared candidate as at 25 February. At the meeting he secured the support of a majority of the 21 National Party parliamentarians, seeing off a last-minute challenge from Queensland MP George Christensen.

Abduction of the Wizard

Abduction of the Wizard () is a 1989 Soviet science fiction film directed by Viktor Kobzev and based on the novel of the same name by Kir Bulychev.
Plot.
The action takes place in Belarus in the 1980s.
The young graduate student Anna comes to her native village to her grandmother's house which she has not visited in 12 years. In the peaceful village she is preparing to write her thesis. Suddenly, two strangers appear in the house and claim that the landlady of this house rented it yesterday to them for two weeks. Events develop and it turns out that strangers got into the twentieth century from the future — the 28th century, with the help of a time machine. Historian Kin and physicist Jules are searching for unrecognized geniuses whose life ended before their time. Their goal is to send such geniuses to the future, without changing the course of history (that is, to evacuate them at the time they are supposed to die). Here they have an intermediate stop and they need to go further, in the 13th century, to find there a certain boyar Roman, who lived at that time in these parts, and take him with them to the future. From the chronicles it is known that he invented gunpowder and the printing press, and, apparently, died when the city was taken by the Crusaders. From their point of view, he is a genius, and according to his contemporaries he is a sorcerer. Involuntarily Anna becomes involved in an amazing and dangerous adventure.
Jules and Kin, with the help of special equipment, receive an image and sound from the past. They see that the town of Zamoshe, where boyar Roman lives, will soon be attacked by crusaders. After finding out the situation, Jules goes after the genius, but in the past he is discovered. The only one who can come to his rescue is Anna. She proposes to send herself to the past and using her similarity to princess Magdalena to help him escape from the prison. The true genius, as it turns out to be, is not Roman, but his ugly and at first inconspicuous assistant Akiplesha. He is saved immediately before the final destruction of the city. Anna is also safely transferred back in her time.

Nand Kishore Bhatt

Nand Kishore Bhatt was an Indian politician. He was a Member of Parliament representing Madhya Pradesh in the Rajya Sabha the upper house of India's Parliament as member of the Indian National Congress. In his tribute read out in Rajya Sabha by the then vice president, Dr. Hamid Ansari, he was described as a distinguished parliamentarian, a veteran freedom fighter and a distinguished trade unionist.
Early life.
Bhatt was born in Shajapur, Madhya Pradesh on December 17, 1919, to Shri Sidhnathji Bhatt. When in eighth grade, his father asked him to drop out of school and join his other brothers in their farming practice. Bhatt did not want to discontinue his education but wanted to study further and also join the freedom struggle as India was still being ruled by the British. Therefore, he left home and went to the city of Indore, which had better schools and gave him an opportunity to join the freedom struggle. He completed his education including a BA and law degree. His alma mater included Christian College – DAV University – Indore, Madhav College – Ujjain, Agra University, Nagpur University and Delhi University.
Freedom struggle.
A freedom fighter and a trade unionist, Bhatt actively participated in the freedom struggle and was imprisoned during the Quit India Movement.
Political career.
Parliamentarian (MP, Rajya Sabha).
Bhatt represented the State of Madhya Pradesh in the upper house, Rajya Sabha, from April 1966 to April 1972; from April 1972 to April 1978; and, again from June 1980 to June 1986. He contested the Lok Sabha election in 1977 from the Indore constituency after the emergency and lost the election by one of the most narrow margins.
Trade unionist.
Bhatt was associated with the INTUC (Indian National Trade Union Congress) since its inception in 1947 and held various positions in that organisation. He served as its president from 1980 to 1984. Throughout his life, he was actively involved in welfare activities for labourers, miners and workers in various sectors. He was chairman of the Joint Committee on the Plantations Labour Bill during 1974 to 1975.
Bhatt visited the United States of America and Japan to study the productivity movement and industrial relations systems in these countries. He was the Leader of the Indian Delegation Young Workers Conference at Casablanca, Morocco, in 1962. Bhatt had attended various International Conferences on labour welfare and trade unions notably the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) Congress at Vienna in 1955 and at London in 1972; ILO Conferences at Geneva in 1955, 1972 and 1973 and Eighth Constitutional Convention of the American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organisations (AFICO) in Los Angeles in 1977. He was also a delegate to the Twenty-First Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in 1975. In September 1964, a delegation consisting of Bhatt and two journalists – Mr. SR Mohan Das from the Economic Times, and Mr. Raghuvir Desai from Majoor Sandesh, Ahmedabad visited England to meet with Frank Cousins, the general secretary of Transport and General Workers Union 
He was also strongly associated with the unions of MOIL (Manganese Ore (India) Limited) and WCL (Western Coal Fields). He was also associated with DPC (Delhi Productivity Council) and NPC (National Productivity Council).
Post retirement.
After retiring from politics, Bhatt started his own social service organization called CLEAR or Center for Labour Education and Social Research. The organization was based out of his residence in Delhi and had an office in Bilaspur, MP (now Chhattisgarh). He served as part of this until his death in 2013. He was referred to as a freedom fighter on several occasions by Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam and PV Narasimha Rao.
Personal life.
Bhatt married Tara Vyas in 1945. They had four children - three daughters and one son. Bhattwas a voracious reader who keenly read all hindu epics frequently. He consistently practiced Yoga and took keen interest in Indian music including playing the Sitar. He suffered a stroke during an Angiogram. He earlier had bypass surgery in 1999. As a result, while he was still able to perform all routine tasks, his eyesight significantly deteriorated affecting his ability to read. He died in his sleep on January 14, 2013. He was survived by his 4 children, 10 grandchildren and 12 great grandchildren.

Idka

Idka AB is a collaborative platform headquartered in Sweden. Idka allows you to connect, share, store and share documents and files, while keeping your data completely safe. Idka is advertising-free, and fully encrypted. The solution combines all of the functionality of social media in one place, and will never share or sell information. The user controls the sharing.
Background.
Idka was founded upon the belief that the advertising-driven model cannot be fixed, contrary to what Facebook and others have said. Idka is the antithesis to the 'Stalker Economy', the foundation of today's social networking, were the users themselves are the product. The built-in drivers of the advertising model will inevitably lead to serious privacy violations, but more than that, it creates a problem for a free democratic way of life. The problem of tailored news (echo chambers), dark posts, political ‘nudging’ and covert political campaigning, profiling and surveillance is real and has already had discernable impact.
Description.
Idka has been created as a product in its own right, where users pay a small monthly subscription for a service with short, understandable, and fair user terms.
The service is free of advertising, news streams, and manipulation. Idka centers on privacy and security, so encryption and 2-factor authentication is central. All default actions are set up to protect the user's privacy. There is no pre-population or prompting to invite or collect friends and contacts. A post will not be shared when published without an intended and specific share action from the user. A private post cannot be changed and shared with new people. People who are added to a many-to-many chat will be able to see chat entries after they are added, etc. A picture in a post cannot be downloaded and it goes away if removed by the person who uploaded it. Delete is really delete, meaning that the information is removed from Idka servers.
The service covers a number of functions that are otherwise spread across several platforms, such as posting, chatting, end-to-end encrypted chatting (like Telegram and Signal), many-to-many chatting (like hang-out), integrated drag&amp;drop cloud storage (like Box and DropBox) without file size limits, etc. When a group is created, it will immediately have its own cloud storage, its own chat and posting wall. Members can be read-only if necessary.
The service also caters to companies with ‘organizational accounts’ and provides more functionality than other Web-based services (such as Slack).
Idka requires no IT knowledge or support and no installation of any kind, except for apps on mobile platforms.
Idka is available as a HTML5 web-based service, or on iOS and Android.

Edward Hope Kirkby

Edward Hope Kirkby (31 December 1853 – 28 July 1915) was a jeweler watchmaker in Williamstown, Victoria who eventually became a manufacturing electrician making systems of fire protection. He is best known for his early X-ray experiments and later wireless experiments, among the earliest in Australia. He experimented on his own account and together with George Augustine Taylor. There are no primary references to George Taylor experimenting with wireless telegraphy himself. Kirkby was the technical genius behind Father Shaw and his Australian Wireless Company.
Early life and family.
Edward Hope Kirkby was born on New Year's Eve 1853 on the Ship “Hope” 16 days out of Port Phillip, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. His father, George Williams Kirkby, was migrating to Australia with his second wife, Charlotte Augusta Collins, and his three sons from his first wife, Eliza Kempson, who had died in childbirth. The voyage was to take 100 days. The family settled in Sandhurst Victoria, later renamed Bendigo. George was to take up business as a cordial, soft drink manufacturer supplying the miners in the gold fields. These were tumultulous times on the gold fields, with the Eureka Stockade rebellion occurring later in 1854 as the miners rose up in protest at the cost of licences. A further five siblings were born here.
It was here that Edward took up his profession of Jeweller watchmaker. His later interest in fire protection may have occurred when he witnessed the burning down of the Beehive building, home of the Bendigo stock exchange. In the early 1880s he studied electricity and magnetism at the Bendigo school of mines, winning awards and later presenting papers on the subject.
He married Jane Gill in Melbourne, daughter of the farrier Jonathan Gill of the old forge in Mt Alexander Rd, Ascot Vale. They initially settled in Sandhurst, where their first son, Frederick Strauss Kirkby, was born. They moved to Williamstown in 1882–1883, where he set up shop in Nelson Place. A further three sons were born here to Edward and Jane.
He applied for his first patent in 1888 for a timekeeping system for VFA matches. In 1893 he applied for his second patent for a system of street fire alarms incorporating the switchboards and communication equipment associated with these alarms. It was adopted by the Melbourne Fire Brigade and other cities. Thus began his life of invention.
In 1901 he moved from Williamstown to the city, operating as a manufacturing electrician making his systems of fire protection and X-ray apparatus, all the while pursuing his interest in wireless telegraphy.
By 1907 Wormald Bros had become his agent making his systems of fire protection. Dissatisfied with their performance, he moved to Sydney NSW with two of his sons, setting up business in the city manufacturing X-ray and medical apparatus.
Evevtually he had a falling-out with Wormald Bros, who were getting rich at his expense, and they dissolved their partnership. Looking for a place to manufacture his systems of fire protection, he approached his friend Father Archibald Shaw, a Catholic priest in the Order of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, the assistant procurator to Father Guis at the orders house in “Ascot” in Dutruc St Randwick to build a factory on land owned by them. They refused and built it themselves and let it to Kirkby, who moved in with his men and tools and began manufacturing his systems of fire protection. Father Shaw knew of his expertise in wireless and asked him to manufacture wireless for him to sell to raise funds for the missions. How lucky was Shaw to have an expert on wireless telegraphy, invention, manufacturing capability experienced in patent application landing on his door step. A gift from heaven answering all his prayers. Sombegan the Shaw Wirless Works or the Randwick Wireless Works.
In 1911, Edward’s wife and the rest of his family moved to Sydney. Kirkby sold out of the works to a new company and moved back to the city. He moved into a house at 1 Burton St, Randwick, where his wife died on 26 July 1915, buried on 27 July, and Edward dropped dead from a heart attack at his place of work on 28 July. They are buried together at Waverley Cemetery.
So ended a life of invention largely unrecognised as biographers of George Taylor and Archibald Shaw claimed all the credit for them for Kirkby’s endeavours.
Professional career.
Edward Hope Kirkby was a jeweler watchmaker in Williamstown who eventually became a manufacturing electrician making systems of fire protection, in 1908 he invented and patented the first automatic sprinkler alarm.
X-ray experiments.
He is first recorded as experimenting with X-ray in September 1896 This is only 9 months after Roentgen presented his discovery of X-rays. He is reported as experimenting with the medical staff at Williamstown Hospital later that year In 1900 Dr Clenndinnen was party to demonstrating X-ray at Bendigo School of Mines using a Kirkby manufactured X-ray coil, said by him that it was an excellent one. Kirkby eventually moved to Sydney in 1907 where he set up business manufacturing X-ray apparatus and consulting with the medical profession
Wireless experiments.
He was first recorded practically demonstrating wireless telegraphy along with X-ray in 1899
He was demonstrating experiments in X-ray and wireless at the Federal Exhibition and Palace of Amusements in 1903 
In early 1905, the use of wireless telegraphy in Europe had increased to the extent that there was much concern by the British Admiralty about mutual interference between neighbouring operators, particularly nearby ships using different transmission systems. This concern was reflected in Australia. The Australian Postmaster-General's Department was not considered a reliable source for comment and an Australian reporter chose to interview Kirkby an expert on the subject. Kirkby correctly identified syntony (as it was then known) or frequency selective transmission and reception as the technological solution to the problem.
Again in January 1905, the highly mobile Kirkby he conducted a demonstration of wireless perhaps better attributed to quackery rather than wireless experimentation, where "on the occasion of the installation of a high frequency electrical apparatus at Elsinore, Glebe Road, Glebe Point. In the darkened room, Mr. Kirkby, who erected the apparatus to the order of Mrs. Clark, showed the visitors the wonders of the high frequency system by which the electric fluid permeates the whole body appearing in jets at all points from the head to the toe of the boot. With all its force the current can be applied to infants, and its curative agency is now established among leading physicians." However later he did undertake some more traditional wireless experiments and we hear no more of such unfortunate diversions.
Kirkby continued to lecture and demonstrate wireless telegraphy and X-rays. In February 1905, at a meeting of the Accountants and Clerks' Association in Melbourne, it was reported: "After the completion of other routine business, Mr. E. H. Kirkby, electrician, was introduced, and delivered a lecture on Some of the Latest Phases of Electrical Science, illustrated by experiments, which included wireless telegraphy, X-rays and other wonders of this science, which were highly appreciated by all present. A vote of thanks to the lecturer concluded the meeting."
In a visit to Adelaide, South Australia in August 1907, a city which was otherwise dormant to wireless telegraphy following the passing of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905, Kirkby is reported demonstrating the technology to a local reporter: "At the U.S.A. depot, Gawler-place, yesterday, a representative of "The Advertiser" was shown a complete model of the wireless telegraphic apparatus by the manager, Mr. H. E. Kirby (sic). The instrument is of a kind used on the large Liverpool American mailboats. It consists of a transmitter, and a receiver, fitted with all the necessary parts, including the tapping key, batteries, spark-inductor, coherer, relay electric bell, connecting peg, batteries, connector for Morse writing apparatus, and air wire. The machine works accurately at a distance of 17 to 20 yards, and with more powerful batteries would doubtless transmit messages to a greater distance. Mr. Kirby first of all started the bell ringing on the receiver when the two parts were in the same room, but to demonstrate the principle more fully he carried the receiver into the next shop, a thick wall dividing the rooms, and then operated again, the bell responding to every touch upon the tapping key.
Kirkby participated as an operator of one of the two wireless stations established by Australian land military forces at their annual Easter encampment. Likely some of the equipment had been manufactured by Kirkby. The experiment was widely reported (with apologies for the language of the day): "The present Heathcote camp may be an historical one, since it has witnessed the first recorded successful use of a wireless telegraph installation in the Commonwealth under military conditions. The recent formation of the Wireless Institute enabled Lieut. G. A. Taylor, A.I.C., to make the arrangements in conjunction with Captain Cox-Taylor, of the Garrison Artillery, who watched the experiment closely, and interestedly with a view to the possible future military development of wireless telegraphy in the Commonwealth. Conditions which would most probably be met with on active service were scrupulously observed by those in charge of the operating stations; indeed, in the determination to impart the utmost realism to the undertaking discomforts innumerable were cheerfully faced by the corps. The surrounding district was depended upon for the supply of most of the paraphernalia. For the masts to support the aerials three saplings were lashed together in each instance, giving an altitude of some 50 or 60 feet. The aerial wires at A station were conveyed to a military tent where the operating appliances were installed, and at station B, to a cave under the crest of the hill beneath the line of targets, some four miles to the south-west. The latter position was of very great interest, inasmuch as on the rocks flanking the cave some queer aboriginal carvings and a deep V cut in a sandstone, used evidently by ancient black warriors to sharpen their implements of war, were discovered. A coincidence was actually established between the ancient, barbarous, warlike messages and the most modern means of communication between fighting forces. The outlying station was in charge of Mr. Reginald Wilkinson, and at the main station Mr. Kirkby operated, while the enthusiastic hon. secretary, of the Wireless Institute, Mr. W. H. Hannam, supervised the apparatus. Considerable time was spent in getting connection between the stations, and the call letter V was continually flashing throughout Saturday and Sunday, until it was at last picked up by the head station, in the small hours of Monday morning. Tuning being now consonant, signals were continually exchanged. The University Scouts took deep interest in these experiments, and lent valuable assistance."
Still promoting the patriotic benefits of wireless, in July 1910, Kirkby and Taylor lectured and demonstrated wireless at a meeting of the United Service Institution in Sydney: "Some very interesting experiments were shown last evening by Lieutenant G. A. Taylor and Mr. Kirkby, whose apparatus was commended by Dr. Bell as the equal of any in the world. At the conclusion of a lecture by the former a button was pressed, and by means of wireless a flag was run up, a breeze set blowing, a gun fired, and a gramophone played "God Save the King."" The lecture was so well received that Taylor and Kirkby responded with a repeat of the lecture and demonstration at King's Hall, Phillip St, Sydney on 31 August 1910, with proceeds going to the Sydney Hospital radium fund.
Taylor only lectured, Kirkby manufactured the equipment and demonstrated it, Taylor was the publisher of the magazine Construction for the Master Builders Association. The only reference to Taylor’s wireless experimentation without any citations or references was by his biographer Giles in 1954. This may have kept Florence, Taylor’s wife, happy as she had commissioned the article that appeared as a supplement to the magazine.
Father Shaw and Australian Wireless Co.
Wormalds Bros manufacturers of fire protection equipment were getting rich at his expense. and he dissolved his partnership with them. He was looking for a place to manufacture his apparatus. He was friends with a Catholic priest Father Archibald Shaw MSC. He and his superior, Father Guis, built a factory for Kirkby on their land at the procure where Kirkby began manufacturing his fire systems of fire protection. The procure was always short of money, and Shaw asked Kirkby to make wireless for him. He did and they became very successful, forming a company the Maritime Wireless Company of Australasia.

1896 United States presidential election in Kentucky

The 1896 United States presidential election in Kentucky took place on November 3, 1896. All contemporary 45 states were part of the 1896 United States presidential election. Kentucky voters chose 13 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
William McKinley won the state very narrowly, becoming the first Republican presidential candidate to ever win Kentucky and the only to carry the state until Calvin Coolidge in 1924.
Background and vote.
Ever since the Civil War, Kentucky had been shaped politically by divisions created by that war between secessionist, Democratic counties and Unionist, Republican ones, although the state as a whole leaned Democratic throughout this era and the GOP would never carry the state during the Third Party System. However, the Democratic Party in the state was heavily divided over free silver and the role of corporations in the middle 1890s, and it lost the governorship for the first time in forty years in 1895 due to Populist defections. For the 1896 election, the Democratic Party would aim to fuse with the Populists, and adopted the Populist free silver platform under former Nebraska Representative William Jennings Bryan.
In contrast to the majority of antebellum slave states, Kentucky was sufficiently close to the industrial Northeast that it had a significant urban working class in its Ohio River cities that opposed free silver because it would cause inflation. Similar views were held by workers in Kentucky’s developing coal mining industry. Polls late in October nonetheless showed Bryan carrying the state by a margin only slightly reduced from what discredited incumbent President Grover Cleveland had achieved in 1892. A week later, however, polls had Republican nominees, former Ohio Governor William McKinley and his running mate Garret Hobart of New Jersey carrying Kentucky by seventeen thousand votes. As it turned out, the state was exceedingly close, with McKinley becoming the first Republican presidential candidate to carry Kentucky, by a mere 277 votes, or 0.06352%. Owing to the direct election of presidential electors and the extreme closeness of the result, one Bryan elector and twelve McKinley electors were chosen.
McKinley’s victory is, by percentage margin, the seventh-closest popular results for presidential electors on record.

John Haag

John Haag (1926-2008) was an American poet and university professor. Born in Sandpoint, Idaho, he spent seven years on the high seas, serving in the United States Merchant Marine during World War II and the United States Navy during the Korean War.
Background.
His writing life began inauspiciously in Theodore Roethke's poetry seminar at the University of Washington. Haag recalled handing his teacher a poem and Roethke's reading "as far as the fourth line, which he slashed away with a great green stroke" from his fountain pen. Haag's next attempt went a little better, as Roethke made it halfway through the poem. While still an undergraduate, he began to place poems in reputable national periodicals, including The New Yorker.
His publications brought fellowships. He went to England in 1959-60 as a Fulbright Scholar, studying at Reading University. There his first collection, "The Mirrored Man: Twenty-Three Poems", appeared in 1961. In 1962, he played the lead part of Bartleby in a film adaptation of Herman Melville's story "Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall-Street."
Returning to the United States with a master's degree, he accepted a position in the English Department at Penn State University. He continued to publish as he taught. His second collection, and his best known, "The Brine-Breather", appeared from Kayak Books in 1971. The poems are mostly metaphysical meditations on the curiosities of marine biology, bringing the sea cucumber, queen conch, and others to light. Mariners in their ships he treats with searching, Roethke-like precision and quirky scientific observation.
Haag's later poems reflect the experience of his life. He lived in rural Milesburg, ten miles from the University where he taught. He raised orchids and cultivated mushrooms, and these appeared increasingly in his poems.
His final collection, "Stones Don’t Float: Poems Selected and New", appeared in 1996 from Ohio State University Press, having won the Press's Journal Award in Poetry. The volume shows his life's work as he moved from an early formalism to open forms.

Gerald Kelley

Gerald Kelley is an American children's book illustrator. He works in an elaborate style with water color and precise detail. Kelley is known for his work on James Bowen's "Bob the Cat" series and "A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo," a best-selling children's book written by Jill Twiss. 
Early life and education.
Kelley was born in Texas and later moved to Florida. He earned a degree in studio art. As an illustrator, he is mostly self-taught, receiving his education from another artist. He regards Albert Uderzo, Peter de Seve, Rien Poortvliet, Jon J. Muth, John Pike, Victor Ambrus, Lisbeth Zwerger, Brian Wildsmith and John Burningham as his artistic influences, as well as television cartoons and animated movies.
Career.
Bob the Cat series.
In 2014, Kelley illustrated two books in James Bowen's best-selling Bob the Cat series. This series started in 2013 with "A Street Cat Named Bob," a book relating the real-life events of Bowen taking in a wounded stray cat, nursing him back to health, and getting over his own addictions in the process. It was followed by a sequel called "The World According to Bob" and children's versions of both books.
The two books illustrated by Kelley are intended for young children. "My Name is Bob" is an imagined prequel about Bob's life prior to Bowen's first book, telling the story of how the cat ended up on the streets. In "Bob to the Rescue," Bob helps a homeless puppy find its owner.
"Grover Cleveland, Again!".
In 2016, Kelley created the graphics for children's educational book "Grover Cleveland, Again! A Treasury of American Presidents" written by the documentary film maker Ken Burns' and which profiles each of the presidents of the United States.
The book was included in the 2017 Notable Social Studies Trade Books for Young People reading list of exceptional books for use in social studies classrooms, created by the National Council for the Social Studies and the Children's Book Council. It was nominated for the 2016 Children’s and Young Adult Bloggers Literary Awards, an annual award for juvenile and children’s books that successfully combine literary merit and popular appeal.
"Please Please the Bees".
"Please Please the Bees" (2017) was Kelley's debut as a children's writer, telling the story of a grumpy bear who learns a lesson when the honey bees in his garden go on strike, demanding improvements in their living and working conditions. It received positive reviews and garnered a 4.2 out of 5 star rating on Goodreads.
It was awarded the 2017 Frances and Wesley Bock Book Award for Children's Literature, an award for books that promote a moral attitude and appeals to young children's sense of wonder and curiosity.
"A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo".
In March 2018, Kelley illustrated a children's book called "A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo" under the pseudonym EG Keller. The book, written by Jill Twiss, is about a fictional day in the life of Marlon Bundo, the real-life pet rabbit of the Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence. The story details the same-sex romance between Marlon Bundo and another rabbit named Wesley. It was conceptualized as a loose parody of "", written by Charlotte Pence and illustrated by Karen Pence (Mike Pence's daughter and wife, respectively). Their book also tells about a fictionalized day of the Pence family's pet rabbit, but without LGBT themes.
A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo was launched during an episode of the satirical talk show "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver" with the intent to mock Pence's staunch opposition to same-sex marriage. Rather than a straight-up parody of the Pences' book, "A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo" is an actual children's story about marriage equality and democracy. It nevertheless contains some stabs at Mike Pence.
The book became an immediate bestseller, receiving notable praise and selling much better than expected. All profits from the book are being donated to The Trevor Project and AIDS United.

MAP-Seq

MAPseq or Multiplexed Analysis of Projections by Sequencing is a RNA-Seq based method for high-throughput mapping of neuronal projections. It was developed by Anthony M. Zador and his team at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and published in "Neuron," a Cell Press magazine.
The method works by uniquely labeling neurons in a source region by injecting a viral library encoding a diverse collection of RNA sequences ("barcodes"). The barcode mRNA is expressed at high levels and transported into the axon terminals at distal target projection regions. Following this, the cells from source and putative target regions of interest are harvested, and their RNA is extracted and sequenced. By matching the presence of the unique "barcode" in the source and target tissue, one can map the projections of neuron in a one-to-many fashion.

History.
In 1967, following the Hough riots and student protests on campus, Dr. Thomas F. Campbell and a group of Cleveland State faculty formed the Ad Hoc Committee on Urban Studies and called on the university to form an urban institute to "bring together faculty from a wide range of specializations to work on urban problems in an interdisciplinary setting, designed in particular to facilitate communication between specialists with common interests in urban problems... linking academic specialists with the political and economic leadership of a large metropolis... [including] a full range of undergraduate courses focusing on urban problems, particularly in the social sciences."
The Institute of Urban Studies first offered classes in the fall of 1968 with the financial support of the Gund Foundation. The program was one of the first members of the Council of University Institutes of Urban Affairs, which became the Urban Affairs Association in 1981.
In 1969, Maxine Goodman Levin, founder of the Cleveland Landmarks Commission and the Cleveland Restoration Society, and a real estate developer, established the Albert A. Levin Chair of Urban Studies and Public Service in honor of her late husband. It was the first endowed chair in the country to allow the chair holder to combine classroom teachings with public service to study and work at finding solutions to urban problems. Cleveland State reorganized the Institute as the College of Urban Affairs consisting of a single department of Urban Studies in 1977. In 1989, the college was renamed the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs, following the benefactor's gift of an endowment to support the college.

Siege of Mercq

On 6 May of 1405, a French army under the command of Waleran III, Count of Ligny and Saint-Pol besieged the English castle at Mercq in Pas-de-Calais.
Siege.
The French siege proved futile as English reinforcements under Lieutenant of Calais Sir Richard Aston arrived with the Calais garrison to counterattack and lift the siege. Although surprised by the English attack the French troops manned the trenches, but the Genoese crossbowmen had no bolts and St. Pol's army suffered losses from English archers. The first to flee were the Flemings, quickly followed by the French and Genoese. Waleran III escaped with remnants of his army, but most were either killed or captured. The English captured all the French artillery, four standards, 60-80 prisoners including Jean de Hangest.

Drakkar (band)

Drakkar (also known as Drakka Band or Thra Kha Band in some Romanized sources) was a Cambodian hard rock band active in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Their music has been noted as an important late-stage development in Cambodian rock of the 1960s and 70s, a thriving music scene that was abruptly crushed by the Khmer Rouge communists in 1975. Some members of the band did not survive the ensuing Cambodian genocide. The band has gone through multiple lineups, with singer/guitarist Touch Seang Tana the only consistent member.
Formation.
Drakkar formed in 1967, amid the flourishing Phnom Penh music scene, to perform rock music inspired by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones as well as early Cambodian guitar bands like Baksey Cham Krong and Apsara. As with many of their contemporaries like Sinn Sisamouth, Ros Serey Sothea, and Pen Ran, Drakkar was influenced by pop records imported from France and Latin America that had become popular among musicians in the capital.
The band initially comprised singer/rhythm guitarist Touch Seang Tana, singer/lead guitarist Touch Chhatha, singer/bassist Mam Molivan, and singer Tan Phanareth, and changing temporary drummers. This first lineup did not record any original music, and the members, all in their teens or early twenties, disbanded and took military or government jobs.
Reformation and popularity.
In 1971, Tana assembled a new lineup with lead guitarist Som Sareth, drummer Ouk Sam Art, and bassist Oer Sam Ol. By this time, the Cambodian music scene was further influenced by Western rock and roll and soul music via U.S. armed forces radio that had been broadcast to troops stationed nearby during the Vietnam War. Drakkar toured U.S. military bases in South Vietnam that year, after which original lead guitarist Touch Chhatha rejoined. This version of the band was heavily influenced by the hard rock sounds of bands like Deep Purple and Grand Funk Railroad, and regularly performed covers of songs by those and other bands. Their sound at the time has been compared to Led Zeppelin, Santana, and Jimi Hendrix.
The band's hippie attire and long hair were noted as symbolic of changing times and American influences in early-1970s Cambodia. Guitarists Touch Chhatha and Touch Seang Tana attracted attention, not all of it good, for their unusually aggressive guitar playing, while drummer Ouk Sam Art caused minor scandals by playing shirtless. Tana noted in the documentary film "Don't Think I've Forgotten" that Cambodia was not yet ready for western-style hard rock at the time.
Khmer Rouge era.
Drakkar became popular in Phnom Penh during the later stages of the Cambodian Civil War, when the city was under threat from both American bombing campaigns and attacks by Khmer Rouge insurgents. Due to wartime curfews, the band had to play in clubs during the day and often heard nearby gunfire and explosions during their performances. The band recorded a self-titled album with primitive technology in 1972-1973, and released it in early 1974. The album, which was rereleased decades later as "Drakkar '74", sold over 20,000 copies, making it the highest-selling full-length album in Cambodian history up to that point.
Plans to further promote the album were halted in April 1975, when the Khmer Rouge defeated the Khmer Republic army and gained control of the country. The members of Drakkar are assumed to be among the two million residents of Phnom Penh who were forced to leave the city and become farm workers to fulfill the Khmer Rouge's visions of agrarian socialism and the eradication of all foreign influences (including music) from Cambodian society. Group members Oer Sam Ol and Som Sareth disappeared during the ensuing Cambodian genocide and their exact fates are unknown. Singer/guitarist Touch Seang Tana was imprisoned in a work camp, and claims that he survived the genocide by singing Santana songs to Khmer Rouge soldiers on demand while passing himself off as a common peasant. Guitarist Touch Chhatha was one of many professional musicians who were forced to play patriotic and traditional music for Khmer Rouge troops practically every day.
Post-Khmer Rouge and reunion.
After the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979, drummer Ouk Sam Art and guitarist Touch Chhatha returned to music work for Cambodia's National Radio station, while Tana became an accomplished manager of fisheries and environmental conservation for the post-Khmer Rouge Cambodian government. Conservation work continued to be a theme in Tana's life. he was the Chairman of the Cambodian Government's Commission for Dolphin Conservation and Development of the Mekong Dolphin Ecotourism Zone (the "Dolphin Commission").
Information about many Cambodian musicians of the 1960s and 1970s, and many of their recordings, were lost during the Khmer Rouge regime. Interest in that scene's musicians was revived, especially among western rock fans, in the late 1990s with the release of compilation albums like "Cambodian Rocks" (1996). Filmmaker John Pirozzi was introduced to the music while making "City of Ghosts", and subsequently featured Drakkar and several of their contemporaries in the 2015 documentary "Don't Think I've Forgotten" (2015). The Drakkar song "Crazy Loving You" has appeared on several compilations, including the "Don't Think I've Forgotten" soundtrack in 2015, and the song "Do You No Wrong Again" (credited to Thra Kha Band) has appeared on compilations like the 2011 CD "Cambodia Rock Spectacular!" from Lion Productions.
Surviving members of Drakkar first regrouped for a reunion concert in Singapore in 2011. They also performed in 2014 and 2015 to commemorate the release of "Don't Think I've Forgotten" and announced plans to record a new album. The 2014 performance featured a guest appearance by Chhom Nimol of the Cambodian/American band Dengue Fever. Nimol, whose band was inspired by and frequently covers late-60s and early-70s Khmer pop music, proclaimed "I never dreamed I would play with those musicians. They are like my teachers, my masters." A new version of the band led by Touch Seang Tana began performing regularly under the name Drakka Band in 2015.
Master tapes for Drakkar's 1974 album were unearthed during this period, and in 2014 it was released as "Drakkar '74" by Metal Postcard Records. Personnel at the label had been inspired by "Cambodian Rocks" and "Don't Think I've Forgotten" to track down the master tapes and remaster them for the digital market. Upon its release, one music historian noted the album's historical importance and hailed it as "The Holy Grail of Cambodian Psych."

Carl H. Shier Farm

The Carl H. Shier Farmhouse was built around 1900 in Dublin, Ohio, replacing an older house on the property. The house is wood framed and L-shaped with gable roofs with slate construction. The same family has owned the property for over 100 years.
In addition to the house itself, the barn and chicken coop, also built around 1900, were all inducted to the National Register of Historic Places on April 11, 1979.
Future plans.
As of 2018, the City of Dublin and Kaufman Development have proposed to demolish the structures to create a new residential community to support the planned Innovation District in the area.

Fort du Roule

The Fort du Roule is a collection of French and German fortifications built in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries on the Roule mountain in Cherbourg (Cherbourg-en-Cotentin since 2016).
The first fortifications were built in 1793 to protect the Bay of Cherbourg from English attacks. The current fort, at the top of the mountain, was built between 1853 and 1857 under Napoleon III. In 1928, the Navy built extensive tunnels under it to store equipment. During the Second World War, the Todt Organisation built several tunnels, installed casemates for artillery, and built gun emplacements. The fort was captured after fierce fighting by the U.S. Army on June 26, 1944.
After the war, the Navy took possession of the site and set up its command post in the first maritime region until 1988, when part of the site became a naval communications center. The School of Military Applications of Atomic Energy uses some of the facilities. The fortifications at the top of the mountain now house the Cherbourg Liberation Museum, and the tunnels leading to the German gun emplacements are open to the public.

2019 National Hurling League

The 2019 National Hurling League is the 88th season of the National Hurling League for county teams.
Kilkenny were the defending champions, having won the 2018 league.
The GAA announced a new broadcast agreement on 10 January 2019 that runs from 2019 until 2022. Eir Sport and RTÉ provide live TV coverage of the league on Saturday nights. TG4 broadcast Sunday afternoon games. The highlights programmes are RTÉ2's "League Sunday" on Sunday evenings, TG4's "GAA 2019" on Monday evenings and Eir Sport's Allianz Leagues Reloaded on Wednesday evenings.
Limerick won their first league title since 1997 after a 1-24 to 0-19 win against Waterford in the final on 31 March. 
Redistribution of the top 12 teams for 2020.
In November 2018, the GAA's Central Council decided to reorganise Divisions 1A and 1B before the start of the 2020 National Hurling League. As a result there was no relegation from 1A to 1B in 2019.
In 2019 the teams ranked 1 to 6 competed in Division 1A and the teams ranked 7 to 12 competed in Division 1B. Following the 2019 League the top twelve teams were redistributed into two groups of approximately equal strength. The two new groups were based on their finishing positions in 2019 and will be redrawn after two years.
On completion of the five rounds on 10 March 2019 and a playoff on 16 March 2019, the two groups in 2020's Division 1 were determined as –
2020 Division 1 Group A
Limerick
Tipperary
Cork (winners of 5th v 6th Division 1A playoff in 2019)
Waterford
Galway
Westmeath
2020 Division 1 Group B
Wexford
Clare
Kilkenny (losers of 5th v 6th Division 1A playoff in 2019)
Dublin
Laois
Carlow
GAA President John Horan was of the opinion that the new Division 1 group structure would give managers "an opportunity to actually play players in a developmental manner" as team selections and tactics are likely to be more experimental if the teams do not have to avoid relegation.
Competition format.
League structure
Thirty-five teams compete in the 2019 NHL – six teams in the top five divisions (Divisions 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A) and five teams in Division 3B. All thirty-two county teams from Ireland take part. London, Lancashire and Warwickshire complete the lineup.
Each team plays all the other teams in their division once, either home or away. Two points are awarded for a win, and one for a draw.
The Division 1 hurling quarter-finals and semi-finals will finish on the day the games are played. If a quarter-final or semi-final is level after the initial seventy minutes, still level after two ten minute periods of extra time played each way, and still level after two further five minute periods of extra time, the outcome will be decided by a free-taking competition. This means the winner of quarter-finals and semi-finals will determined without requiring a replay and allow the league finals to be held on the scheduled date.

Division 1 Format.
In 2019 the 12 teams in Division 1 were organised into two further divisions - teams ranked one to six in Division 1A and teams ranked seven to twelve in Division 1B. In 2020 the twelve top teams will be redistributed into two divisions of approximately equal strength which will be redrawn every two years.
Each team played all the other teams in their group once. Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw. The top four teams in both 1A and 1B advanced to the league quarter-finals with the top team in 1A playing the fourth team in 1B, the second team in 1A playing the third in 1B, etc. Two semi-finals and a final followed.

Division 1 Quarter-Finals.
The hurling quarter-finals finish on the day the games are played, avoiding the need for replays. If the score is level after the initial seventy minutes, still level after two ten minute periods of extra time played each way, and still level after a further two five minute periods of extra time, a free-taking competition is held. Each team nominates five players to take frees from their chosen position on a sixty five metre line selected by the referee and without defenders. The nominated players from each team take alternate turns. If the teams score an equal number of the five frees, the outcome of the match is decided by sudden death frees using the same nominated players in the same order.
The fixtures are 1st in Division 1A plays 4th in Division 1B, 2nd in Division 1A plays 3rd in Division 1B, etc. Home advantage is decided by whichever team has played fewer home games in their five league games, with a coin toss taking place if the number of home games played is the same for both teams.
Division 1 Semi-Finals.
The hurling semi-finals finish on the day the games are played, avoiding the need for replays. If the score is level after the initial seventy minutes, still level after two ten minute periods of extra time played each way, and still level after a further two five minute periods of extra time, a free-taking competition is held.

The nominated players from each team take alternate turns. If the teams score an equal number of the five frees, the outcome of the match is decided by sudden death frees using the same nominated players in the same order.
Division 1 Final.
The final was postponed from 24 March to 31 March 2019 as three of the round five fixtures were called off due to bad weather on the weekend of 2–3 March.
Division 1A Play-Off.
This playoff between the teams ranked 5th and 6th in 2019's Division 1A was used to determine which of the two groups the teams were allocated to in 2020's restructured Division 1. Brian Cody, the Kilkenny manager, described it as "a futile match really".

Maria Choglokova

Maria Semenovna Choglokova née Hendrikova (1723 - 19 March 1756), was a Russian Empire lady-in-waiting and noble. She was a cousin and confidante of Empress Elizabeth of Russia, and chief lady-in-waiting to the future Catherine the Great. She played an important part in the early married life of Catherine, and is given a prominent place in Catherine's memoirs.
Life.
Maria Semenovna Choglokova was the 4th of five children and the second eldest of three daughters of count Simon Hendrikov and Kristina Skavronskaia and thus the maternal first cousin of Empress Elizabeth. In 1742, she married Nikolai Naumovich Choglokov (1718-1754). She had married for love, was thus faithful to her spouse without difficulty and gave birth regularly - she was to have four daughters and four sons during her marriage.
After the marriage of Grand Duke Peter to Catherine in 1745, Choglokova was appointed chief lady-in-waiting and mistress of the household of the Grand Duchess in succession to Maria Rumyantseva, and her spouse was given the equivalent position of Chamberlain to the Grand Duke. They were appointed by recommendation of Pyotr Bestuzhev-Ryumin because of the happiness and fertility of their marriage, and was to act as an example for Peter and Catherine, whose procreation was politically important. Their task was to supervise the young couple and their behavior in all aspects and make sure that their marriage resulted in procreation of heirs to the throne and their behavior was suitable in the eyes of the public. Choglokova, for example, was always to make sure that Catherine never neglected her religious duties, and or placed herself in any situation with men that could damage her reputation.
In 1752, a change occurred in the behavior of Choglokova. Until then concerned with the marital virtue of Catherine, according to the first version of Catherine's memoirs, edited by Alexander Hertzen, Choglokova had a conversation with Catherine in which she assured Catherine that adultery could be acceptable if circumstances made them necessary. She asked Catherine if she would prefer Sergei Saltykov or Lev Naryshkin, and when Catherine answered that she preferred the former, Choglokova stated that Catherine could trust her and her love for her country, and that she could be assured that she would be of no trouble to her. There is a version of Catherine memoirs that Choglokova only advised her to obtain a platonic lover to make Peter jealous, to consummate their marriage with Peter and to obtain a legal heir to the throne. This conversation is famous and has been interpreted as an indication that Choglokova acted on the orders of Empress Elizabeth, who was tired of the slow procreation of Peter and Catherine and would allow for Catherine to become pregnant from Peter by any means to get rid of both Catherine and Peter ASAP as heirs involved in military plots against Elizabeth.
During the last years of their service at court, the Choglokov marriage itself fell apart, and after her husband had committed adultery, Choglokova did the same. She was widowed in 1754 and was relieved of her court office, and her and husband was replaced in their respective offices at court by another couple: Catherine Ivanovna Kasturina (1718-1790) and Alexander Shuvalov.
She remarried A. I. Glebov.
Fiction.
She was portrayed by Katya Galitzine in Young Catherine (1991).

Devin White

Devin Marcel White (born February 17, 1998) is an American football linebacker for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at LSU, and was drafted by the Buccaneers fifth overall in the 2019 NFL Draft. He won his first Super Bowl championship in 2021, in a 31–9 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LV.
High school career.
Devin White attended North Webster High School in Springhill, Louisiana where he played football as a standout linebacker and running back.
White was a controversial recruit out of high school, having multiple run-ins with police. In November 2015, he and his teammate Keuntra Gipson were arrested for having sex with a 14-year-old, a misdemeanor in Louisiana. One month later, White was arrested for misdemeanor charges of “careless operation of a motor vehicle and flight from an officer.” Because of his legal situation, White was dismissed from the 2015 Under Armour All-America Game. Despite these controversies, he was still able to sign with LSU to play football.
College career.
In his sophomore season at LSU, White led the SEC in tackles with 133, the fourth-most tackles in a single season in school history. He became the first player in SEC history to be named Defensive Player of the Week four times in the same season. Following his junior year, White decided to forgo his senior year and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.
Professional career.
2019 season.
White was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the first round with the fifth overall pick of the 2019 NFL Draft. His selection made him the highest drafted LSU defensive player since Patrick Peterson in 2011, as well as the highest drafted linebacker in school history. On July 20, 2019, the Buccaneers signed White to a fully guaranteed, four-year, $29.32 million contract including a signing bonus of $19.34 million.
White made his NFL debut in Week 1 against the San Francisco 49ers, making six tackles in the 31–17 loss. In Week 2, during a 20–14 win over the Carolina Panthers, White sprained his MCL which resulted in him missing the next three games.
In Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks, White recorded a team-high 12 tackles, half a sack on Russell Wilson, and two forced fumbles on running back Chris Carson, one of which that was recovered by teammate Jordan Whitehead in the 40–34 overtime loss. In Week 11 against the New Orleans Saints, White recorded a team-high 13 tackles in the 34–17 loss. In Week 12, during a 35–22 win against the Atlanta Falcons, White recorded eight tackles and sacked Matt Ryan twice, the first multi-sack game of his career. In Week 13, during a 28–11 win against the Jacksonville Jaguars, White had a team-high seven tackles, his first career interception off a pass thrown by Nick Foles, and recovered a strip sack by teammate Shaquil Barrett on Foles for a touchdown. As a result of White's strong play in November (39 tackles, 2.5 sacks, one pass deflection, and two forced fumbles from Weeks 9–12), he was named NFC Defensive Rookie of the Month. As a result of White's strong play in December (29 tackles, two pass deflections, one interception, one forced fumble, four fumble recoveries, and two fumble return touchdowns from Weeks 13–17), he was named the NFC Defensive Rookie of the Month.
White finished his rookie season with 91 total tackles, 2.5 sacks, three pass deflections, one interception, three forced fumbles, four fumble recoveries, and two fumble return touchdowns.
2020 season.
In Week 2 against the Carolina Panthers, White recorded a team-high 15 tackles, of which 11 were solo, during the 31–17 win. In Week 6 against the Green Bay Packers, White led the team with 10 tackles and sacked Aaron Rodgers once during the 38–10 win. In Week 7, during a 45–20 win against the Las Vegas Raiders, White recorded a team-high 11 tackles, of which nine were solo, as well as a career-high three sacks on Derek Carr, one of which resulted in a fumble, earning NFC Defensive Player of the Week honors. In Week 15, White recorded 12 tackles (four for a loss), sacked Matt Ryan three times, and defended two passes in a 31–27 comeback win over the Atlanta Falcons, earning his second NFC Defensive Player of the Week honors of the season. In Week 16, during a 47–7 win over the Detroit Lions, White recorded 10 tackles and a sack. On January 1, 2021, it was revealed that White tested positive for COVID-19, and, along with teammates Shaquil Barrett and Steve McLendon, was placed on the reserve/COVID list by the Buccaneers on January 1, 2021, and was subsequently activated on January 11. White finished the 2020 regular season with a team-best 140 total tackles as well as nine sacks, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery, and four pass deflections.
White made his postseason debut in the Divisional Round against the New Orleans Saints. During the game, White led the team with 11 tackles (10 solo), deflected one pass, recovered a fumble forced by teammate Antoine Winfield Jr., and intercepted a pass by Drew Brees as the Buccaneers defeated the Saints 30–20. In the NFC Championship against the Green Bay Packers, White led the Buccaneers with 15 tackles (nine solo) and recovered a fumble forced by teammate Jordan Whitehead as the Buccaneers defeated the Packers 31–26 to advance to Super Bowl LV. In the Super Bowl against the Kansas City Chiefs, White recorded 12 tackles, two tackles for loss, and the game sealing interception off a pass thrown by Patrick Mahomes in the end zone to secure a 31–9 victory for the Buccaneers.

2020 Cameroonian parliamentary election

Parliamentary elections were held in Cameroon on 9 February 2020, together with municipal elections. The Cameroon People's Democratic Movement retained its majority in parliament, winning 139 of the 167 seats decided on election day.
Background.
The elections had originally been scheduled for 2018. However, in June 2018 President Paul Biya sent a letter to leader of the Senate seeking to delay the elections until October 2019. On 2 July 2019 parliament voted to extend its mandate by twelve months. Ahead of that date the following June, documents leaked on social media purporting to show Biya's negotiations with parliamentary leaders to further delay parliamentary elections to coincide with municipal elections in February 2020. The ongoing Anglophone Crisis dominated the process, with supporters of Ambazonia calling for a boycott of the election. Ensuing violence resulted in a low turnout in the Northwest Region and Southwest Region, with separatists claiming that 98 percent of eligible voters had boycotted the election.
Electoral system.
The 180 members of the National Assembly are elected from 58 single- and multi-member constituencies based on the departments. In single-member constituencies, first-past-the-post voting is used. In multi-member constituencies, a modified form of closed list proportional representation is used, in which a party receiving over 50% of the vote in a constituency wins all the seats, but if no party receives over 50% of the vote, the party with the most votes is awarded half the seats and any other party receiving over 5% of the vote receives a proportional share of the remaining half of the seats based on the largest remainder method and Hare quota.

Mid Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship

The Mid Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship (known for sponsorship reasons as the Centenary Agri Mid Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship) is an annual hurling competition organised by the Mid Tipperary Board of the Gaelic Athletic Association since 1907 for senior hurling teams in Mid Tipperary, Ireland.
The series of games begin in April, with the championship culminating with the final in August. The championship has always been played using a knock-out format.
The Mid Tipperary Championship was, until recent times, an integral part of the wider Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship. The winners and runners-up of the Mid Tipperary Championship joined their counterparts from the other three divisions to contest the county championship quarter-finals.
Nine clubs currently participate in the Mid Tipperary Championship. The all-time record-holders are Thurles Sarsfields, who have won a total of 45 titles. 
Drom-Inch are the title-holders after defeating Upperchurch-Drombane by 2-19 to 1-21 in the 2019 championship final.
The championship.
Overview.
The Mid Tipperary Championship is a knockout tournament with pairings drawn at random — there are no seeds.
Each match is played as a single leg. If a match ends as a draw there is a period of extra time, followed by a second period of extra time should the teams remain deadlocked. If both sides are still level at the end of extra time a replay takes place and so on until a winner is found.

Hinds Hotel

The Hinds Hotel (also known as the Freestone House, Freestone Hotel, Park House, and Wayside Inn) is a historic building located in Freestone, California in the United States. Built in 1876, the Hinds Hotel is a former hotel, antique store and plant nursery. Today, it serves as a private commercial business and home. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and has been named a California Historic Landmark and a Sonoma County Historic Landmark.
History.
The 32-room Hinds Hotel was built in August 1876 by Hollis B. Hinds. A farmer, Hinds moved to Sonoma County in 1863 from Tennessee. He built the hotel upon the announcement that the North Pacific Coast Railroad would start serving Freestone, which would serve as the terminus. The hotel was frequently used by carpenters working on the railroad line. According to first hand reports, the innkeeper at the Hinds Hotel intentionally had parts of a nearby bridge, that the carpenters were building, burned at night, delaying the completion of work in order to retain his client base longer. The innkeeper would serve time in jail for his efforts.
As of 1910, the building was called Park House and in the 1930s it was called the Wayside Inn. By 1930, railroad service had stopped and the train tracks were removed in Freestone.
By the mid-20th century, the property served as a plant nursery. The building, as well as the surrounding 22-acres, was purchased by Tom Golden and Jim Kidder in 1970. The building served as their private home. The home served as the "social headquarters" during the design and installation of the landmark installation art piece, "Running Fence" by Christo and Jeanne-Claude.
In 1974, the Sonoma County Landmarks Commission designated the Hinds Hotel as a historic landmark. The Hinds Hotel is a part of the Freestone Historic District.
Architecture.
A two-story wood frame building, the hotel is built in the Gothic Revival style. It was originally built as an L shaped building. Prior to 1902, a balcony was added to the building. The original three step platform in the front of the building was restored. The building is built using shiplap siding. Flat trim surrounds the six over six double hung sash windows. The entry doors on the lower floor are symmetrically placed and are embellished with stained glass. The side door entry has a single, paned door with colored glass sidelights and traces.
The gable has center gables in two main sections of the front facades. The roof is trimmed with a plain cornice and wide frieze board. The board extends down the corners to the trim around the top of the platform. There are Gothic windows under the center gables, comprising a central pointed arch glass door with narrower, shorter pointed arched windows at each side, which are topped with label molding.

Rob, his legendary stunt man commandant Dirk Hamsteak and their entire staff of instructors spend a semester defending their beloved Academy at all costs. No matter how many people criticize it...go missing...or die!"
Production.
Development.
On January 14, 2018, it was announced that Crackle was developing a new half-hour comedy series written and executive produced by Rob Riggle entitled "Rob Riggle's Jet Ski Academy".
On March 29, 2018, it was announced that Crackle had given the show, now titled "Rob Riggle's Ski Master Academy", a series order consisting of a first season of eight episodes. The show was created and written by Riggle who is also set to serve as an executive producer alongside Jonathan Stern, Keith Quinn, Bennett Webber, and Chris Pizzi.

Reception.
In a positive review, "Decider"s Joel Keller praised the series saying, ""Rob Riggle’s Ski Master Academy" is a loopy combination of self-awareness, improv craziness, and meta metaness. Does it work all the time? No. But there’s a reason why shows of this ilk, starring Riggle, Scheer, or any combination of their early-’00s UCB alumni buddies is usually good for a guffaw or two: these folks have been doing improv together for 20 years, and the chemistry and ease is always apparent when they perform together."

Van der Lee is a Dutch toponymic surname meaning "from the Lee". "De Lee / Lede / Lei" was a common name for a canal, derived from the verb "leiden" ("to lead") and the city of Leiden ultimately derives its name from such a canal as well. Families with this name have perhaps six different places of origin in the Netherlands. Variants include "Van der Lei(j)", "Van der Leede" and "Van der Lede(n)". The Brazilian family name "Vanderlei" and "Wanderley", now also used as given names, was introduced in Brazil in 1637 by the Dutch cavalry captain Gaspar/Caspar van Niehof van der Leij, who may have been born in Gummersbach.

<doc id="56978762" url="?curid=56978762" title="Ravenfield (video game)">
Ravenfield (video game)

Ravenfield is a first-person shooter game developed by Swedish programmer Johan Hassel, who goes by the pseudonym SteelRaven7. It was released on 18 May 2017 as an early access title for Windows, macOS and Linux.
Gameplay.
The game incorporates rag-doll-like physics, with many options to give users the ability to control the AI, including a 'battle plan', and many other game factors such as AI count. Ravenfield consists of multiple team game modes that revolve around capturing areas on the map and gaining points by killing members of the enemy team. The game pays homage to large scale multiplayer first-person shooter games such as the Battlefield franchise and franchise. As such the game has a focus on large scale maps and vehicle based combat with the teams controlling the more powerful vehicle spawn points often gaining the advantage in battle. Modding is supported via the Steam Workshop, with community members designing their own maps, weapons, vehicles and accompanying lore. 
A second mode, titled Conquest, combines the pre-existing elements of large scale combat with turn based strategy, similar to the Galactic Conquest mode seen in . Game levels are represented by tiles on the map, and each tiles can hold up to three battalions. The objective of conquest mode is capture the opposing team's headquarters.
Plot.
While Ravenfield has no plot per se, during the 2019 Halloween Event, SteelRaven7 hinted at the possibility of an underlying plot in the game. It is speculated that more will be revealed in future updates to the Conquest game mode. In July 2020 an update was released overhauling the Spec Ops game mode. It also introduced the first named characters, TALON team. TALON team is a 4 man special forces unit in the Eagle army. Later in December of that year 2 new characters were added: The Advisor, a second in command to the player character, and EYES, a reconnaissance specialist who assists TALON with avoiding enemy patrols and locations objectives.
Development.
Ravenfield started out as an experiment with ragdolls and AI. The beta version was released on itch.io on 3 July 2016. The game was posted on Steam Greenlight on 1 February 2017, and it was officially released as an early access title on 18 May 2017.
Reception.
Christopher Livingston of "PC Gamer" called the game "glitchy” and "fun".
The game boasts an "Overwhelmingly Positive" review score on Steam, and a 4.8/5 on itch.io.
Nathan Grayson of Kotaku criticized Ravenfield as "glitchy" and "barely functional in some places"; however, he noted its ability to support a high number of computer-controlled players and expressed fascination with its good reception by players on Steam. The game supports Steam Workshop, and creators from the community have added new weapons, vehicles, maps, and features that add to and expand the game's vanilla feel, which was well received by players.

Sophie Albert

Bianca Regina Lyttle Reyes (born August 3, 1990), professionally known as Sophie Albert, is a Filipino actress and television personality of European and Chinese descent. She joined the GMA Network in 2017.
Career.
2010–2016: Early television career.
Albert was one of the new talents launched by ABS-CBN's Star Magic in their Batch 15 in 2007, using the name Bianca Reyes. From a young age, it was already her dream to be an actress. She joined Star Magic without telling her parents because her mother did not wish for her to enter show business because she was still young and studying. This was also the reason why she left showbiz soon after.
In 2012, again without the knowledge of her parents, Albert joined the televised talent search "Artista Academy" of TV5. She became the competition's female grand winner, The Best Actress. Albert has mentioned that her winning the competition has convinced her mother of letting her re-enter and stay in the entertainment industry.
TV5's management suggested she use a screen name instead of her real name because of the abundance of Biancas and Reyeses already present in the Philippine showbiz world. "Albert" is her maternal grandmother's maiden name.
2017–present: Breakthrough with GMA Network.
After asking to be released a few months early from her contract with TV5, Albert decided to become an actress without any home network. She did one project in ABS-CBN, the broadcast network and parent company of Star Magic. Soon after, in October 2017, Albert signed an exclusive contract with GMA Network. She has since gotten a steady stream of projects for years. Albert credits the network for working at her desired pace. She rose to stardom via her portrayal of Reign, a rich and evil concubine in "Bihag" who caused the death of Ethan and Jessie’s misfortune.
Personal life.
Albert did not want it to be known to the public, but eventually it was found out that she is a member of the prominent Cojuangco family. Former Filipino President Corazon Aquino is her paternal grandmother Josephine's sister. This means she is the niece of former Filipino President Benigno Aquino III, actress and host Kris Aquino, and actress and equestrienne Mikee Cojuangco. Albert has mentioned that Mikee, in particular, was very supportive during her time on the talent show "Artista Academy".
Albert has been dating actor Vin Abrenica since January 2013. The two had met the previous year as co-competitors on "Artista Academy", which they both won. Albert and Abrenica initially ended their relationship in 2016, citing "personal and career-related problems", but reconciled in 2018. In December 2020, the couple became engaged. In February 2021, Albert revealed that she and Abrenica had moved in together. That same month, they announced that they were expecting their first child, a daughter. Their daughter was born on March 15, 2021.

YelloPark was a proposed football stadium planned to be built in Nantes, France. It was expected to serve as the stadium of FC Nantes and as a football venue for the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris and the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The stadium would have had a capacity of 40,000 and its construction was projected to take place between 2019 and 2022. It was to be built near the Stade de la Beaujoire that it was planned eventually to replace.
In a vote on 7 December 2018, Nantes Metropolitan Council agreed to discuss the sale of land critical to the proposed YelloPark project. Councillors also voted for the renovation of the Stade de la Beaujoire. However, after deliberations on 19 February 2019, the Council voted against selling the land needed to develop the project. On 26 February 2019, the project was subsequently cancelled.

<doc id="56978824" url="?curid=56978824" title="Peter Kwasniewski">
Peter Kwasniewski

Peter Andrew Kwasniewski (born 22 March 1971) is an American traditionalist Catholic writer and composer of sacred music. He is a senior fellow of the St. Paul Center in Steubenville, Ohio, and was formerly on the faculty of Wyoming Catholic College. He is also the author of four books about traditional Catholicism: "Resurgent in the Midst of Crisis", "Noble Beauty, Transcendent Holiness", "Tradition and Sanity", and "Reclaiming Our Roman Catholic Birthright".
Life and career.
Kwasniewski was born on 22 March 1971 in Arlington Heights, Illinois. He grew up in New Jersey. At the Delbarton School in Morristown, he received his first serious tutelage in music. After a year at Georgetown University, Kwasniewski matriculated as a freshman at Thomas Aquinas College in California, where he earned a B.A. in liberal arts in 1994. He subsequently studied at The Catholic University of America, focusing on ancient Greek philosophy and medieval scholasticism. He received his M.A. in philosophy in 1996, writing a thesis on "The Dialectic of Reason and Faith in Descartes's "Meditationes de prima philosophia"" and his Ph.D. in the same discipline in 2002, with a dissertation on "The Ecstasy of Love in Thomas Aquinas".
He served as Assistant Professor of Philosophy from 1998 to 2006 at the International Theological Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family in Austria (then in the town of Gaming) and as an adjunct instructor in music appreciation at the Franciscan University of Steubenville's Austria Program located on the same campus. In 2006, he joined the founding team of Wyoming Catholic College in Lander, Wyoming, where he served as assistant academic dean and director of admissions, and then as choirmaster and Professor of Theology and Philosophy. He also taught music and art history in the college's fine arts curriculum.
At the end of the academic year of 2017–18, Kwasniewski left Wyoming Catholic College. He is currently working as an independent writer, editor, publisher, and guest lecturer, giving talks and workshops on the traditional liturgy of the Catholic Church.
Kwasniewski is a board member and scholar of The Aquinas Institute, which is publishing the "Opera Omnia" of St. Thomas Aquinas; a fellow of the Albertus Magnus Center for Scholastic Studies; and a senior fellow of the St. Paul Center in Steubenville, Ohio.
Public reception.
Kwasniewski's books, lectures, and articles have met with both considerable praise and opposition. Major prelates and Catholic magazines and websites have praised Kwasniewski for his insights into the crisis in the Church, while others have criticized him for insubordination to the present wishes of Church leaders. Some, like Fr. Anthony Ruff, OSB, of the PrayTell blog, have criticized Kwasniewski for an intransigent defense of traditional things, especially preconciliar, and for his apparent rejection of the reforms intended by the Second Vatican Council. Ruff, in particular, argues that Kwasniewski depends excessively on the Council of Trent, whose doctrine was, according to him, completed and corrected by Vatican II. Jonathan Daly maintains that Kwasniewski's vocal preference for traditional worship is itself characteristically modern because it is a lifestyle and worldview choice over against other options that have more to recommend them, such as the contemporary magisterium. 
Support for Kwasniewski's positions and writings has also been substantial. In 2016, the international Catholic TV station EWTN broadcast a TV interview with Kwasniewski on their popular "EWTN Live" channel and also began carrying his book "Resurgent in the Midst of Crisis" in their online catalog. That same year, TV Infobar made available the video of the book launch of the Czech translation of "Resurgent," at which Cardinal Burke introduced the book, calling it "very readable and very accessible" and thanking Kwasniewski "for giving us this work." Other positive publicity for this book included "New Oxford Review", which claims that "Kwasniewski accurately sums up the current situation in the Church" and that "Resurgent" is "a starting point for serious discussion" for "revitalizing the Church". "New Oxford Review" also published reviews of Kwasniewski's "Tradition and Sanity", "Reclaiming Our Roman Catholic Birthright", and "Reader in Catholic Social Teaching."
His book "Noble Beauty, Transcendent Holiness" was praised by "The Catholic Herald" in Britain and the "National Review", both of which published favorable reviews.
His collection of writings on Eucharistic reverence published by Sophia Institute Press, "The Holy Bread of Eternal Life", bears endorsements from Scott Hahn, Peter Kreeft, Michael O'Brien, Fr. Gerald E. Murray, and Dan Burke; the printed edition adds Fr. Serafino Lanzetta of the Theological Faculty of Lugano, Fr. David Meconi, editor of "Homiletic and Pastoral Review", and Msgr. Charles Pope of the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C.
Scholarly work.
Dr. Kwasniewski has published a number of books and articles in the field of Thomistic studies. His first book—"On Love and Charity", from Catholic University of America Press—is a translation, with introduction and notes, of major portions of Aquinas’s "Commentary on the Sentences" ("Scriptum Super Sententiis"). At the time it appeared in 2008, it was the most extensive translation into English from that work of Aquinas’s that had yet been published, as explained in its Appendix II (pp. 395–97). Subsequently, Kwasniewski has worked with the editorial team of The Aquinas Institute in the translating, editing, and production of volumes of its "Opera Omnia" series, which now includes a complete translation of Book IV of the "Commentary on the Sentences", with Books I, II, and III in preparation.
Defended in 2003 at Catholic University of America, Kwasniewski’s dissertation for his doctorate in philosophy was published in revised and expanded form in 2021 by Emmaus Academic Press under the title "The Ectasy of Love in the Thought of Thomas Aquinas". This study has won significant praise from scholars around the world: “quite simply the best extended treatment of Thomas Aquinas’s understanding of ecstasy” (Michael Sherwin, O.P., University of Fribourg), “a very thorough, detailed analysis of the concept of ecstasy, primarily in the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, but also in the spiritual, theological and philosophical tradition upon which he was drawing” (Kevin L. Flannery, S.J., The Pontifical Gregorian University), “rectifies the neglect of "extasis" by undertaking a thorough examination of the theme in Aquinas’s writings, and in so doing, reveals the surprising importance of "extasis" as a key to understanding the Thomistic doctrine of love” (Kevin White, Catholic University of America), “opens a seam in Thomas’s thought that has been neglected, if not wholly forgotten . . . offers a hugely important avenue into his ethics and anthropology” (Graham McAleer, Loyola University Maryland), “one of those rare, profound, scholarly works—like those by Jean Leclercq or Etienne Gilson—which is also written so beautifully, with so much love and clarity, and with so much wisdom” (Jason Baxter, Wyoming Catholic College).
Kwasniewski has published several scholarly studies of Aquinas in the English-language edition of the international theological journal "Nova et Vetera": “Golden Straw: St. Thomas and the Ecstatic Practice of Theology,” "Nova et Vetera" 2.1 (2004): 61–90; “Doing and Speaking in the Person of Christ: Eucharistic Form in the Anaphora of Addai and Mari,” "Nova et Vetera" 4.2 (2006): 313–80; “Aquinas on Eucharistic Ecstasy: From Self-Alienation to Gift of Self,” "Nova et Vetera" 6.1 (2008): 157–204; “St. Thomas on the Grandeur and Limitations of Marriage,” "Nova et Vetera" 10.2 (2012): 415–36. Related to these articles is the chapter “The Angelic Doctor and the Glory of Eucharistic Theology,” pp. 43–68 in Kwasniewski's book "The Holy Bread of Eternal Life". The article on the Anaphora of Addai and Mari, which elaborates a Thomistic account of how a traditional Eucharistic prayer without the words of consecration could still effect transubstantiation, was the subject of a critique by Ansgar Santogrossi, OSB, “Historical and Theological Argumentation in Favor of Anaphoras without Institutional Narrative: A Critical Appraisal,” "Divinitas" 51.1 (2008), which was also published in "Die Anaphora von Addai und Mari—Studien zu Eucharistie und Einsetzungsworten", edited by U. M. Lang.
Other scholarly work by Kwasniewski on Aquinas includes “Transcendence, Power, Virtue, Madness, Ecstasy—Modalities of Excess in Aquinas” ("Mediaeval Studies"), “‘Divine Drunkenness’: The Secret Life of Thomistic Reason” ("The Modern Schoolman"), an article on St. Nicholas of Myra in the life and writings of St. Thomas ("Angelicum"), and articles on Thales, Proclus, Bonaventure, Ockahm, Leibniz, and the composer Anton Bruckner. He contributed two chapters to "The Glory of the Cosmos: A Catholic Approach to the Natural World", edited by Thomas Storck (Arouca Press, 2020): “Genetically Modified Organisms: A Catholic’s Animadversions” and “Listening with an Attentive Ear to God’s Poetry.”
He also edited a Festschrift on the occasion of the seventy-fifth birthday in 2007 of Fr. Lawrence Dewan, O.P. (1932–2015), "Wisdom’s Apprentice", which contains essays by Jan A. Aertsen, Stephen L. Brock, David B. Twetten, J.L.A. West, Ralph McInerny, Leslie Armour, Gregory T. Doolan, Christopher A. Decaen, Jude P. Dougherty, Ralph Nelson, Kevin L. Flannery, and Heather McAdam Erb. Kwasniewski wrote an "In Memoriam" for Fr. Dewan, a teacher he says he greatly esteemed and got to know personally.
Ecclesial controversies.
In 2016, it was revealed that Kwasniewski was among the clergy and theologians who signed the "Letter of the 45", a letter to all the Catholic cardinals which asked them to "respond to the dangers to Catholic faith and morals" which they alleged that Pope Francis' "Amoris Laetitia" had posed. Kwasniewski was also a signatory of a letter in support of the four Dubia cardinals. In April 2019, Kwasniewski was among 19 Catholic scholars and clergy who signed a 20-page open letter making a formal accusation of heresy against Pope Francis. These documents have been published in the book "Defending the Faith Against Present Heresies" (Arouca Press, 2020), which also includes 31 items (articles and interviews) commenting on the various initiatives, among which are found two essays by Kwasniewski. 
Kwasniewski has spoken out strongly against Pope Francis’s teaching on the death penalty and particularly his changes to the "Catechism of the Catholic Church". He has been an outspoken critic of this pope on other topics as well—for example, on the motu proprio "Spiritus Domini" modifying canon law to open the ministries of lector and acolyte to women; and the pope's apparent veneration of Pachamama at the start of the Amazon Synod as well as the agenda and conduct of that synod;
Although Kwasniewski discusses his understanding of the nature and limits of the papal office in many articles, the most comprehensive treatment to date seems to be a lecture entitled “My Journey from Ultramontanism to Catholicism”. He has distanced himself repeatedly from and unequivocally rejects sedevacantism. To an Orthodox hieromonk who had critiqued the Catholic Church in the modern West, Kwasniewski wrote a rejoinder expressing sympathy but also questioning some of his conclusions and presenting arguments in favor of the Roman Church. In an article called “Is It Ever Okay to Take Shelter in an SSPX Mass?,” he summarized the changes over the years in the Vatican’s attitude toward the Society established by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and counseled Catholics, if their canonical right to the Extraordinary Form as per "Summorum Pontificum" is denied in their parish or diocese, to avail themselves of Society chapels. He exhorts Catholics not to give up on the Church in spite of what many consider to be its current corruption and waywardness.
Music.
In addition to being a teacher and writer, Kwasniewski has enjoyed a parallel career as a choirmaster, cantor, and composer of about 150 works of music.
After studying composition and conducting with Roy Horton and voice with Carol Horton at Delbarton School in Morristown, New Jersey, Kwasniewski became assistant choir director at Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula, California (1990–1994). He served as director of the Schola Cantorum at Old St. John's Catholic Church in Silver Spring, Maryland (1994–1998), director of music at the International Theological Institute in Gaming, Austria (1999–2006), and founding choirmaster and schola director at Wyoming Catholic College (2007–2018).
Kwasniewski's Mass settings, motets, hymns, carols, antiphons, and acclamations have received numerous performances from 1990 to the present. His Mass settings include "Missa Spiritus Domini" (1994), "Missa Spe Salvi" (1995, rev. 2012), "Missa Brevis" à 3 (1997), "Missa Hereditas Mihi" à 3 (2016), and "Missa Honorificentia Populi Nostri" (2017). His "Seven Mandatum Antiphons" (2010) were dedicated to Arvo Pärt on the occasion of his 75th birthday; the maestro personally accepted the dedication. Many of these works can be found in his book "Sacred Choral Works," which was highly acclaimed when it first appeared in 2014. Ensembles that have performed Kwasniewski's choral music include the Ecclesia Choir (dir. Timothy Woods), the Vittoria Ensemble (dir. Rick Wheeler), the Scottish ensemble "Cantiones Sacrae" (dir. Graeme Adamson), and Cantus Magnus (dir. Matthew Schellhorn).
Kwasniewski has also written a three-movement wind quintet "Fire and Flame," premiered by the Antero Winds in 2012; an "Ave Maria" for SATB, winds, and strings; a violin sonata; organ accompaniments for English plainchant; and pieces for brass quartet and string quartet.
He has published numerous articles on music, especially on the recovery and renewal of sacred music in the contemporary church.
Publications.
"Resurgent in the Midst of Crisis" has been published in Czech, Polish, German, Portuguese, Belarusian, and Spanish editions:
Kwasniewski writes for a number of traditionalist magazines and blogs, including The Latin Mass magazine (since 2006), New Liturgical Movement (weekly since 2013), Rorate Caeli (since 2014), OnePeterFive (since 2014), LifeSite News (since 2017), The Remnant (since 2019), and Catholic Family News (also since 2019).

Frank Foulkes

Frank Foulkes (born 1899) was a British trade unionist. One of the most prominent communist trade union leaders in the United Kingdom, he left office after being convicted of involvement in rigging an election.
Foulkes completed an apprenticeship as an electrician and joined the Electrical Trades Union. He also became active in the Labour Party, and at the 1929 UK general election was an election agent for the party. However, soon after the election, he instead joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB).
Foulkes gradually came to prominence in the ETU, initially becoming a shop steward, then serving on branch and district committees before working full-time for the union as an official based in Merseyside. In 1942, he was elected as the union's national organiser, in which role he became known for his negotiation skills. This led him, in 1946, to win election as the union's General President. In 1954, he led a major one-day strike of electricians. He also served as President of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions in 1959/60.
In 1959, the union's general secretary, Frank Haxell, also a CPGB member, narrowly won a bid for re-election against Jock Byrne. Byrne and Frank Chapple took Foulkes, Haxell and thirteen other CPGB members to court, alleging that the election had been fixed. In 1961, they won the case, and Byrne was installed as general secretary. Foulkes argued that he had no knowledge of any fraud and so should retain his position, but he lost a second court case in 1962 on the grounds that, given his oversight role, he should have been aware that the election was rigged. He then decided to take early retirement, receiving a pension from the union despite the opposition of its new leadership.

A.D. 2044

A.D. 2044 is a Polish adventure game by LK Avalon, released September 9, 1996 on Windows.
Production.
The game is a remake of a 1991 game entitled A.D. 2044: Seksmisja developed by R.M.P. Software and published by LK Avalon, released to Atari 8-bit computers. It was a simple point and click adventure game created by Roland Pantoła. The new game is based on the same narrative, but with updated graphics.
It was the first Polish computer game released on two CDs and to have rendered three-dimensional graphics. The game was accompanied by a promotion in mass media that was unprecedented in scale for the country. While the game was originally released in Polish, English subtitles were finally added to the game in 2017.
Plot and gameplay.
Based on the film "Seksmisja" by Juliusz Machulski, the game is set in a future post-apocalyptic world where women rule the planet. This is caused by a radical women's group who capture some nuclear weapons and demand equal power from men, who respond by sending missiles which causes a nuclear winter. A thousand women survive by being in an underground bunker. In 2044, they discover a single male who was preserved in a hibernation capsule. The player is this male who escapes capture and begins to explore the environment.
The game plays like a point and click adventure. Players collect and manipulate items and click on hotspots. A male voice narrates the story and also provides hints.
Critical reception.
Gra.pl felt the 1991 version should be treated as a mere "interesting curiosity" in comparison to the more "interesting and better developed" one from 1996.
Metzomagic noted the game window was more generous that in other games, reaching around two-thirds of the screen. Imperium Gier felt that while the game was once considered very good, by the standards of 2012 it is simply average. However, the reviewer also noted that the game was a milestone in the Polish video game industry. Gry Online thought the game's visual design was its draw card.

Goat Canyon (Carrizo Gorge)

Goat Canyon is a valley in San Diego County, California, United States, located within the Carrizo Gorge in the Jacumba Mountains. The rock forming the canyon is crystalline basement. One feature of the canyon is a dry waterfall. The canyon is bridged by a wooden railroad trestle, the Goat Canyon Trestle, which is the world's largest curved all-wood trestle. The canyon is accessible by trail by traveling west from Mortero Palms.
Flora and fauna.
Goat Canyon is named after desert bighorn sheep that live within and around the canyon. During a desert bloom, which occurred in 2017, monkey flowers were observed flowering in the canyon. The endangered species least Bell's vireo migrates through the area around the canyon.
Human history.
Prior to Spanish governance, there was Native American activity in the area around Goat Canyon; the impact of this activity includes petroglyphs and pictograms in Carrizo Gorge. The last Native Americans to live in the area were the Kumeyaay. Later cattle ranchers utilized the area. Beginning in 1912, construction began on the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway in the area. The Carrizo Gorge portion of the line, including Goat Canyon, was the final portion to be completed. A railroad tunnel of The San Diego and Arizona Railway, Tunnel number 15, was built into the side of the canyon but it collapsed in 1932. The collapse was caused by an earthquake, which dramatically changed the inclination of Tunnel number 15. After Tunnel number 15 collapsed, it was decided that it would be bypassed using a wooden trestle. During the construction of the trestle, segments were lowered into the canyon from the partially completed trestle. Construction workers took breaks in a portion of the collapsed tunnel that they called the "mud shed". The trestle was completed in 1933.
In 1976 Hurricane Kathleen's effects impacted the region around the canyon, destroying tracks and other trestles in Carrizo Gorge; the trestle over Goat Canyon was also damaged, with some of its footings destroyed during the hurricane. By 1981, repairs from the hurricane damage were completed. Heavy rains returned to the area in 1982 and 1983; this led to rail service being discontinued over Goat Canyon and through Carrizo Gorge. After repairs were again completed, trains once again ran over Goat Canyon in 2004. In 2008 the trains once again stopped running over Goat Canyon.
Popular media.
In 1999, Huell Howser traveled to the canyon to visit the trestle over it. In 2017, the canyon was depicted in a "Mysteries of the Abandoned" episode on the Science Channel.
Other uses.
There is another Goat Canyon in San Diego County, which is located north of the Mexico–United States barrier and south of the Tijuana River.

West Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship

The West Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship (known for sponsorship reasons as the Tipperary Co-Op West Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship) is an annual hurling competition organised by the West Tipperary Board of the Gaelic Athletic Association since 1930 for senior hurling teams in West Tipperary, Ireland.
The championship has always been played using a knock-out format.
The West Tipperary Championship was, until recent times, an integral part of the wider Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship. The winners and runners-up of the West Tipperary Championship joined their counterparts from the other three divisions to contest the county championship quarter-finals.
Four teams currently participate in the West Tipperary Championship. The title has been won at least once by 13 different teams. The all-time record-holders are Clonoulty-Rossmore, who have won a total of 20 titles.
Clonoulty-Rossmore are the title-holders after defeating Éire Óg Annacarty in the 2017, 2018, and 2019 championship finals.
The championship.
Overview.
Since there are currently only two senior clubs in the division Clonoulty-Rossmore and Éire Óg Annacarty automatically qualify for the final. That game is played as a single leg. If that game ends as a draw there is a period of extra time, followed by a second period of extra time should the teams remain deadlocked. If both sides are still level at the end of extra time a replay takes place and so on until a winner is found.
Records.
By decade.

Claire Kerwin

Claire Kerwin (1919–2005) was a Belgian-born Canadian artist that worked and experimented with several different mediums which included acrylics, collages, metalworking, mixed media, painting, pastels, graphics, and printmaking. She was born in Chatelet, Belgium and emigrated to Canada in 1947 at the age of 28. Her artistic style consisted of combining the elements of urban life and nature. Kerwin was a member of five different Canadian art societies, including the Royal Canadian Academy of Art. Kerwin's works were exhibited in public and private collections in Canada as well as internationally in Belgium, France, England, Brazil, and the United States. The Art Gallery of Northumberland houses several of her works in their permanent collection. Kerwin was awarded a Medal of Service from the City of Toronto for her contributions to the local art scene.
Career.
Kerwin was a volunteer at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Ontario. She went bi-weekly to the Discovery Gallery, drawing different artifacts, such as Egyptian mummies and prehistoric plants, to test her skills. Her drawings were reproduced on labels for visitors to provide quick identification of the specimens in the gallery. Kerwin enjoyed her volunteer work here saying, "I could live another 30 years to work on all the exhibits in the Discovery Gallery….I find it a stimulating challenge". The museum curator, Ruth Freeman, saw her drawing and began assigning her to draw the artifacts that could be touched in the exhibit from all 19 curatorial departments. She was bilingual in French and English which helped her create labels for the drawings in both languages.
Kerwin had a printmaking studio on Monteith St in Toronto where she practiced her mixed media prints. She acquired her materials, consisting of old copper and lead, from parking lots and gutters. She made mixed-media prints through copper and lead collages against etched Masonite or fine Japanese paper. She pleated the lead, hammered it, then fluted it to mould it into what she desired. Her appreciation for lead goes back to her childhood in Belgium where she saw many lead works in galleries and liked the lead pots and pans in her house. She began working with metals in her prints in 1974. Since then, she has garnered increased attention in Canada and around the world. Her visits to Sudan and Morocco brought different colours to her works that can be noticed in the coppers and lead that she used. She credits the environment around her for giving her all these different materials saying, "Nature has done all the work for me". Kerwin also bought some materials when needed. She enjoyed the possibilities that exist with the combination of the metals and the papers. Kerwin displays the prints over a landscape to create a new visual aesthetic that is reminiscent of her inspirations from Morocco.
In 1991, Kerwin was commissioned by the Toronto Dance Theatre to design a set for the production, Noli Me Tangere. The background is composed of three luminous and monumental rock formations. She was inspired to create this type of set after a trip to South Africa. These formations heightened the drama of the production as stated by Alina Gildiner from "The Globe and Mail". It allowed the dancers to interact with it in a way that created the possibilities for things to be presented fully or suggested in the production.
Kerwin expressed her sense of country and city in her work as seen in her work at the Gallery Pascal in 1983. She used marigolds as a representation of the countryside. They were presented up close against a lush green backdrop to symbolize the summertime. The embossed paper and lead pieces in her work relate to the city, symbolizing the dullness and gray that can define city life at times. Kerwin had a lot of experience in print-making which was helpful when she explored new ground in paper executed on pastel, gouache, and acrylic.
Her skill in graphics garnered international attention from large corporations who commissioned her to create works for them. She has collections at several companies such as Bell Canada, The Bank of Brazil, and Imperial Oil of Canada, among others.
Personal life.
She is the daughter of Emile and Elisabeth Roland. She married her husband George Kerwin in 1947 and had two children with him, Michael and Shawn. Michael was a musician and Shawn was a stage designer. She enjoyed playing tennis, squash, and farming in her spare time. Kerwin and her husband owned a farm in Cobourg, Ontario where she spent time when she was not in the city. She was a member of the Toronto Lawn Tennis Club. She lived and worked at her studio on Monteith St. in Toronto until her death in 2005 at the age of 86.

The Devil and Father Amorth

The Devil and Father Amorth is a 2017 American documentary film directed by William Friedkin showing the ninth exorcism of an Italian woman in the village of Venafro referred to as "Cristina", this time performed by Father Gabriele Amorth.
Production.

Release.
The film premiered at the 74th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2017. It had a wide release in the United States on April 20, 2018.
Reception.
Despite the Director's claims of having not altered any footage https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2018/10/is-the-demon-voice-in-the-devil-and-father-amorth-real/ Subsequent investigations have show the audio recording of the "possessed" was manipulated with sound effects. Vanity Fair published recordings that show the difference between the original audio and the faked audio used in the film https://www.vanityfair.com/video/watch/devil-and-father-amorth-witnessing-the-vatican-exorcist-at-work . 
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 44% based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 4.88/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""The Devil and Father Amorth" sets out to interrogate age-old questions of faith, but fails to find enough compelling answers -- or reasons for viewers to watch." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
Robbie Collin of "The Telegraph" wrote that the film "feels amateurish and arguably also exploitative [...] although perhaps that lends it credibility: in this context, too much polish would almost certainly be cause for suspicion." Owen Gleiberman of "Variety" called the film "a rather tawdry charade."

Agnes Alfred

Axuw (c. 1890 – 1992), known as Agnes Bertha Alfred following her baptism, was a Qwiqwasutinuxw storyteller and noblewoman of the Kwakwaka'wakw. Alfred was recognized by her peers as one of the last great storytellers with a long memory. Alfred was born on Village Island, British Columbia. The location of her passing is unknown. Alfred was renowned for her hand-woven cedar-root and cedar-bark baskets, and also practiced the art of storytelling. Alfred was keen on relaying her knowledge and her people's way of life using classic oral tradition. In 1922, Agnes Alfred was imprisoned by the Canadian government for participating in a potlatch ritual, which was outlawed at the time. In 2004, her memoirs were published in "Paddling to Where I Stand: Agnes Alfred, Qwiqwasutinuxw Noblewoman."
Early life and family.
As a child, Alfred attended missionary school for a short time. It was said that this portion of her life 'deprived her of her cultural and human identity.' Despite this, Alfred considered her life to begin the moment she was baptized as a Christian. Alfred's name was given to her at baptism by bishop Mors. Joe Harris. This occurred much later in life. As Alfred refers to it, she did not 'come to her sense' as a Christian earlier. As a result of this perspective on practicing Christianity, there is little documentation of her life before her baptism. Alfred was already married to her husband, Morris, at this point. All of Alfred's thirteen children were named 'by the book', meaning Alfred chose all thirteen names with biblical reference. Throughout her life as a Christian, Alfred worked to keep alive her Indigenous traditions of potlatches and winter dancing while transitioning her career into a money economy and experiencing the changes of white technology and culture.
Career.
Born in about 1890, Alfred grew up one generation behind the practice of slavery among the Qwiqwasutinuxw people. She also lived two generations before oral storytelling began to give way to literature. This gave her unique talent for the art of storytelling extraordinary precedents during the time she was alive. For the entirety of her adult life and career, Alfred was a respected, nonliterate woman who had experienced unthinkable shifts to the state of her people. Throughout this time of her life she maintained her position in the Kwakwaka'wakw nobility, and continued to hone her crafts as a storyteller and cedar basket weaver. Majority of the documentation of Alfred's story-telling career was done in her later life. Alfred experienced practically no western education and spoke no English. Throughout her career as a storyteller, Alfred managed to keep the Kwakwala language alive in both its classical and everyday forms. Some of Alfred's stories were recorded in her later life by ethnographic recordings that collected the Kwakwakewak view of the sea. These recordings of stories told by Alfred related to myths and beliefs pertaining to aquatic mythical creatures, as well as the sea itself. Alfred's career exemplifies the type of knowledge that quickly disappears when language is not in everyday use.
Imprisonment.
Alfred's career was storytelling and basket weaving. However, she also worked to protest her peoples' right to potlatch ritual practice. Both Alfred and her husband Moses Alfred were arrested by the Canadian government for participating in potlatch ritual, an outlawed practice, in 1922. Fortunately, Alfred lived to see the return of potlatch ritual in 1978 in the Qwiqwasutinuxw ceremonial paraphernalia in the National Museum of Man in Ottawa.
Major works and contributions.
"Paddling to Where I Stand" (titled from the name meaning 'Many guests are paddling towards me;' i.e., to attend her family's potlatch) is Alfred's most significant piece of work. Alfred documents through imagination and historical accounts the basis of surviving Indigenous life during the turbulent time she lived. "Paddling to Where I Stand" tells the role of First Nations women as noble matriarchs in a changing society, in context with her own life and personal experiences. Alfred also uses this book to offer a deeper understanding of traditions and practices such as prearranged marriage and potlatches. Alfred includes the significance of knowledge portrayed through songs, storytelling, and chants. Arranged in a lax sequence of events, this book is a raw representation of Alfred's voice, occasionally interrupted by editor Sewid-Smith to enhance the meaning of Alfred's portrayals. "Paddling to Where I Stand" goes beyond a Kwakwaka'wakw culture interpretation piece. With this work, Alfred contributes her first-hand experience, as a woman, to one of the most influential moments in Canadian history.
While it was not the bulk of Alfred's career, she was an extremely talented and successful cedar basket weaver. The cedar baskets are woven with green and cream twine. Alfred created functional, West Coast open multi-purpose baskets. These are bowl shaped with flat bottoms. The handle ties in this example are worn, implying signs of use.

El Tráfico

El Tráfico is a soccer rivalry between the two Major League Soccer (MLS) clubs based in the Los Angeles area, LA Galaxy and Los Angeles FC. The rivalry is one of two crosstown series in MLS, alongside the Hudson River Derby in the New York City area, and replaced the SuperClasico between the LA Galaxy and now defunct Chivas USA.
Background.
Los Angeles FC was established in 2014, shortly after the dissolution of Chivas USA, an MLS franchise based in Los Angeles and owned by C.D. Guadalajara. Chivas shared the StubHub Center in Carson, originally known as the Home Depot Center (2003–2013) and now known as Dignity Health Sports Park, with the Galaxy but had far lower attendances during its final years of operation. The two teams competed in the SuperClasico, named for the Mexican rivalry between Guadalajara and Club América. The two teams met 31 times in ten seasons, with the Galaxy winning 20 matches and Chivas winning four.
Los Angeles FC built a new stadium in Exposition Park, approximately north of Carson on Interstate 110. LAFC's owners have also expressed interest in hosting rivalry matches at the larger Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, also located in Exposition Park.
History.
The two teams' academies met for the first time in September 2016, ending in a 3–3 draw.
The first match between the two senior teams, LAFC's third-ever regular season game, was played on March 31, 2018, at the StubHub Center. Despite LAFC leading 3–0 after 60 minutes, the match ended in a 4–3 win for the Galaxy, including two goals from substitute Zlatan Ibrahimović on his debut. The teams played at Banc of California Stadium on July 26 and was followed by a second match at the StubHub Center on August 24 during MLS Rivalry Week. The second meeting, on July 26, ended in a 2–2 draw at the Banc of California Stadium. Six fans were arrested in clashes between fans at the stadium, where seats were damaged and fights broke out. The final meeting of the two teams in 2018, played a month later on August 24, ended in a 1–1 draw at the StubHub Center.
The first El Tráfico match of the 2019 season, played in July at Dignity Health Sports Park (formerly the StubHub Center), ended in a 3–2 victory for the hosting LA Galaxy. Ibrahimović's scored all three Galaxy goals and earned a hat-trick, while Carlos Vela scored both of LAFC's goals. The visiting LAFC supporters came in a 17-bus convoy and wore camouflage outfits as part of a "united front", having been inspired by a similar display by German club Dynamo Dresden. The return fixture at Banc of California Stadium a month later ended in a 3–3 draw, with two goals apiece for Ibrahimović and Latif Blessing after a second-half comeback from LAFC.
The two teams met in the Western Conference Semifinals during the 2019 MLS Cup Playoffs, which was hosted by top-seeded LAFC after the Galaxy advanced from the first round against Minnesota United FC. LAFC won 5–3, breaking a six-match winless streak against the Galaxy, with pairs of goals scored by Vela and Adama Diomande. LAFC advanced to the Conference Final, where they lost 3–1 to Seattle Sounders FC, the eventual MLS Cup 2019 champions.
The opening El Tráfico fixture of the 2020 season was scheduled for May 16, but MLS suspended all operations in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The two teams were drawn into Group F of the MLS is Back Tournament, which would be played without spectators at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Florida. LAFC and the Galaxy met in the second matchday on July 18, 2020, with Vela opting out of the tournament and the Galaxy's Javier Hernández injured. LAFC won 6–2, setting a new record for largest margin of victory in El Tráfico, with four goals from Diego Rossi; both of the Galaxy's goals had come in the first 31 minutes, from an own goal and a penalty kick.
Fan activities.
Los Angeles FC's fanbase consists of new MLS fans as well as former LA Galaxy and Chivas USA fans. In January 2018, a mural commissioned by LAFC in Pico-Union was vandalized with the colors of the Galaxy within hours of being completed and unveiled. This followed an earlier incident where paint in LAFC's colors was sprayed over a Galaxy mural at Hawthorne Memorial Park and a Galaxy billboard. Both fanbases later defaced property during the inaugural year of the rivalry.
Moniker.
"El Tráfico" (literally "The Traffic" in Spanish) was a name created by MLS fans and adopted by media outlets following polls by SB Nation blogs LAG Confidential and Angels on Parade. It refers to the notorious traffic congestion in Los Angeles, among the worst in the United States and the world, while also serving as a pun on "El Clasico". MLS has no plans to trademark the name. The rivalry has also been called the "Los Angeles Derby", a moniker that was also used for the SuperClasico. The name has faced opposition from executives within LAFC, coach Bob Bradley, and the president of the 3252, LAFC's largest supporters group.

Alex Mashinsky

Alex Mashinsky is an entrepreneur who has founded several notable technology firms in the United States. He founded Arbinet in 1996 as a commodity exchange for telecommunication companies to trade unused long-distance minutes. Mashinsky's' other company, VoiceSmart, was one of the first firms to offer telecommunications switches to handle ordinary voice as well as Voice over IP call routing.
Mashinsky founded GroundLink in 2004 as a service to book an on-demand limousine and car services from a computer or smartphone. He was also the founder of Q-Wireless, which later became part of Transit Wireless. From 2014 to 2015, Mashinsky served as CEO of Novatel He currently serves as CEO of the Celsius Network which is a CeFi lending platform operated by use of blockchain technologies.
Mashinsky lives in New York City with his wife Krissy Mashinsky and 6 children.
Early life.
Mashinsky was born in Ukraine and grew up in Israel. From an early age, he was a tinkerer, like his father, and would tap into and use public phone lines in Israel. Mashinsky attended a few different universities where he majored in electrical engineering but did not graduate. He later served in the Israeli Army. At the end of the 1980s, he left Israel and moved to the United States.
Career.
After relocating to New York City, Mashinsky ran a business trading contracts for delivery of chemicals such as urea, gold, and sodium cyanide. However, after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the business slowed as exports of sodium cyanide from China fizzled. Mashinsky then worked at A+ Systems, a computer-based voicemail software company for phone carriers.
He was also an early developer of Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP). In the early 1990s, he founded VoiceSmart, one of the first companies to offer computer-based VOIP phone service. By 1993, Mashinsky had realized the potential for a commodity market for international telephone capacity. So, in 1996, Mashinsky founded Arbinet, a marketplace for VOIP telephone service. The platform was one of the first to allow telecommunication companies to trade minutes. In November 1997, Arbinet began offering a similar service for data connectivity, allowing the more than 400 T1 lines connected to its New York hub to exchange their unused bandwidth.
In 2005, he sold his stake in Arbinet and used part of the profits from the sale to start GroundLink. The company allowed people to book limousine and car service from a smartphone or computer. Mashinsky was inspired to start the company after a car he had reserved for him and his wife failed to pick them up and a business associate he was trying to impress from the airport. In 2010, Mashinsky organized a joint venture between GroundLink and several limousine and car service companies. These companies with LimoRes Car &amp; Limo Service, a company Mashinsky also founded, installed free Wi-Fi service funded solely by sales of advertising. He also partnered with Gogo Inflight Internet to offer the free service on US flights.
Mashinsky's company Q-Wireless is one of the four companies that made up Transit Wireless, a joint venture to install wireless cellphone and free Wi-Fi internet service in the New York City Subway system. It took Mashinsky three years to convince Metropolitan Transportation Authority to initiate a survey to determine if there was a demand for cell phone service inside the subway system and two more years for the authority to request a proposal. By 2010, his company had received a contract to install the service at 277 below-ground subway stations in New York City.
In April 2014, Mashinsky was named to the board of directors of Novatel which is a provider of Wi-Fi hotspot products. He was appointed CEO in June of that year. In October 2015, Mashinsky left his position at Novatel after a year and a half as CEO of the company.
Mashinsky started a company called Celsius Network, a borrowing and lending platform based on the blockchain technology Ethereum.

Be Careful (Cardi B song)

"Be Careful" is a song recorded by American rapper Cardi B. It was released on March 29, 2018, as the third single from her debut studio album "Invasion of Privacy" (2018). The song was written by Cardi B, Jordan Thorpe, and produced by Boi-1da, Vinylz, and Frank Dukes. It contains an interpolation from "Ex-Factor", written and performed by Lauryn Hill, which itself samples "Can It Be All So Simple", written and performed by Wu-Tang Clan. The latter song also samples "The Way We Were". Therefore, Hill, the eight members of Wu-Tang Clan, and Marvin Hamlisch, Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman are credited among the composers.
"Be Careful" peaked at number 11 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100, and topped the Rhythmic Songs chart. Internationally it reached the top 40 in Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The song was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It received a nomination for Best Rap Performance at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. On April 7, 2018, Cardi B performed the song on Saturday Night Live, where she revealed the pregnancy of her first child.
Background and release.
A demo of some lines for "Be Careful" was first recorded by Pardison Fontaine, the stage name of Jordan Thorpe. Later, Cardi B added the hook and wrote the rest of the song, with production completed with the help of producers Frank Dukes, Boi-1da and Vinylz. Cardi was motivated to write the song when she was in New York City finishing her debut album, "Invasion of Privacy" (2018). Annoyed about her past romantic relationships and the unfaithfulness in them, she found herself tense and upset – prioritising work, with too many bad thoughts. Initially some listeners believed the song was addressed to Cardi's fiancé, rapper Offset, however she denied this. The song was released a week after its recording with "Drip" in February 2018.
Composition.
Cardi B performs the hook using a softly sung vocal style over a "laidback" beat. The song also comprises "flickering" hi-hats and "slick" synths. Lyrically, "Be Careful" is a song about infidelity, where the performer warns her cheating partner and asks him to treat her better. During an interview, Cardi B expressed she drew inspiration from past relationships, while denying that the song was directed at her fiancé Offset.
Chart Performance.
"Be Careful" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at 16 on April 14, 2018 before rising and peaking at 11 the next week after the release of Invasion of Privacy. The song spent 20 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100.
Music video.
Directed by Jora Frantzis, the song's music video premiered on May 21, 2018. The clip opens with a wedding in a church filled with Jesus statues and crucifixes located in the middle of the dessert. Cardi B walks down the aisle in a wedding dress. The clip shifts to a darker hue as the rapper returns to the church, this time for her husband's funeral. The music video was filmed at the Sanctuary Adventist Church in Lancaster, California.
Live performances.
On April 7, 2018, Cardi B performed "Be Careful" on "Saturday Night Live". During the performance she revealed her pregnancy.

Durium Records

Durium was an Italian record label, active from 1935 to 1989. Part of the catalogue and the brand were subsequently taken over by Ricordi, who used it for some reissues. Its initial trademark consisted of the writing Durium in block letters, surmounted by the stylisation of three trumpets and an eagle. Immediately after the war, this logo was abandoned to move to the stylisation of a disk with three internal rays crossed by the writing "Durium" in italics.
History.
Early years.
Durium SA was founded in 1935 in Milan (originally as Durium La Voce dell'Impero) by a group of Milanese entrepreneurs including Martinengo and Alberto Airoldi, who became its president. The headquarters were in Corso Garibaldi in Milan and production covered both discs and sound producers.
The first records released were recitations of tales for children, and other productions aimed at emigrants and troops abroad. In the years 1935/1936 - lacking the material for the production - discs were also published on cardboard supports, containing language courses, technical courses, and propaganda. With the outbreak of war the offices and some recording studios were transferred from Milan to Erba.
Development.
At the end of the Second World War after the return to Milan in the new headquarters in the passage of the Osii 2 the company, meanwhile become Durium, moves the administrative and representation offices in via Manzoni. The core of what will be the burning and printing remains in Erba.
It is a period of economic difficulties linked to the still immature Italian discography; the financial position stabilizes in 1948 with the entry into the society of the Armenian-born entrepreneur Krikor Mintanjan (whose surname is sometimes Italianized in Mintangian) who nominates his wife Elisabel responsible director and assumes as artistic director the nephew of the co-founder Alberto, Aurelio Airoldi, who will remain in the company until 1987, and the pianist, arranger, and composer Franco Cassano, who will remain at the direction until 1986.
In addition to directing the record company, Cassano publishes several albums for the label as a pianist and writes several hits for their artists such as Sei divent nera for Los Marcellos Ferial, also recorded in Chinese, Melodia for Jimmy Fontana, brought to success in the Kingdom Engaged by Engelbert Humperdinck with the title The Way It Used to Be and which will be engraved in the world in several other languages.
It is above all the scouting activity of new artists, as well as the development of new promotion and sales strategies, to relaunch the label. In the fifties, while the Italian discography has its own identity with the birth of record companies such as RCA Italiana and CGD, new artists are produced such as Aurelio Fierro, Flo Sandon's, Roberto Murolo and Marino Marini, giving a great boost to the activity in light music.
In the sixties are promoted characters like Little Tony, Los Marcellos Ferial, Rocky Roberts, Bruno Venturini, Le Snobs, Wess, Dori Ghezzi, Fausto Papetti, Passengers, Camaleonti, Nini Rosso, I Vianella; artists who enjoy a strong support thanks to the director of the press office of the record company Luciano Giacotto who in the same years is also director of the youth music magazine Ciao Amici, as well as producer.
The Durium sensed since the fifties the importance of distributing licensed foreign music using its increasingly advanced factory in Erba; here is the distribution of international artists such as Al Caiola, Don Costa, James Brown, Paul Anka, Mouth &amp; MacNeal, Donna Summer, Ferrante &amp; Teicher, Dee D. Jackson, Steve Lawrence, Eydie Gormé, Don McLean, Shirley Bassey, Plastic Bertrand, Telex and many others.
In 1977 Durium reached its peak with a net sales increase of 35% compared to the previous year, for a total of 6.25 million dollars at the time.
Corporate structure.
In a short time Durium became a leading company in the Italian recording world; even in advance of many multinational companies, already in the first post-war period he began to create a complete system dedicated to artists: from recording albums to their distribution, also managing printing and promotion.
Regarding the registration, in via Troya (near Piazza Napoli) was set up a well-equipped recording studio kept continuously updated.
At Erba, in via Trieste, the production plant where long-playing was printed and the music cassettes under the responsibility of Valsecchi and then Mario Cvek had been left since the post-war period. The modernization proceeded seamlessly with continuous investments, to the point that in 1977 the plant was distinguished in the Italian landscape for the modernity of the plants and for the quality of work. Throughout the era of vinyl and audio cassettes, a good part the activity was carried out on behalf of third parties for the most famous and important Italian record companies.
Failure.
In 1981 Durium celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in advance, but sales, thanks to the diffusion of recordable audiocassettes and the spread of music through free radio stations, are already falling sharply: from 800,000 copies a few years earlier, a hit by a number one it can not sell more than 400 000 copies.
The crisis worsens in the second half of the eighties, coinciding with the diffusion of CDs and at the same time with many record companies: in 1986 Krikor Mintanjan abandoned the company, taken over by Luca Rinaldi, who subsequently sold it to Enrico Rovelli; the same man who also bought Ariston Records in the same period.
Despite this in the eighties continues the activity of scouting leading to the success of many artists, including Vanadium, one of the first Italian heavy metal bands, and a young Fiordaliso that launches at the Sanremo Festival hits like Una Dirty Poetry, Oramai and I do not want not the moon.
Rovelli then tries to restructure the company, which involves the abandonment of production and printing, that is the now too expensive Erba plant, and the outsourcing of recording and mixing of disks, thus also abandoning the studies in Piazza Napoli.
The same Rovelli tries to establish a company, Kono Records, with the intention of merging the catalogues of Durium and Ariston, but because of the liabilities accumulated by the two companies the operation is not successful.
The Kono therefore born as an independent record company incorporating some artists of the Ariston and Durium, which both cease all operations in 1989. The offices of the registered office, in via Manzoni, are also abandoned.
Durium catalogue.
While Rovelli will continue his career as a manager of many artists, including Vasco Rossi, the catalogs of Durium and Ariston will be at the center of legal disputes, being then sold to Ricordi and subsequently merging into the patrimony of the purchaser BMG. The same Durium brand is acquired by these companies and, although not formally renewed, has been used occasionally to reprint the records of some artists.
Sub-labels.
Like many other record companies, Durium also gave birth to some sub-labels of which the best known is the Italian Targa, which has also released some albums and 45 rpm of Vasco Rossi; in addition, Durium distributed other labels such as Sprint, Titanus and Karim.
The Durium, in addition to having recorded and printed for years respectively artists and media for other companies without factories, has also taken care of the distribution for other record companies. For example, for some years it has been involved in the distribution of the PDU, the record company founded by Mina.
Releases.
Dates below are based on the disc label, or on the vinyl or, finally, on the cover; if none of these elements had a date, on the numbering of the catalogue; if existing, the month and the day are shown over the year.
45 rpm.
Circus - Catalogazione CN A.
The "Circus" was a small label distributed by Durium; it was then acquired by the parent company, which continued to publish 45 rpms using the same catalogue number.
45 rpm - Durium Marche Estere.
The Durium Marche Estere was a sub-label of the parent company, which in theory would have had to print disks of foreign origin, although in reality this did not always happen: in some cases it printed discs of songs of soundtracks.
The numbering, however, was preceded by the prefix DE, while in the label (which was different from the durium standard, as it had a large "d" corresponding to the disc hole) there was the writing Durium Marche Estere.
33 rpm - Dischi Adventure.
The Durium distributed (and later took over) also Roman label, Discs Adventure, specializing in launching new artists and publishing of jazz albums. The letter A of the 45 rpm is found in some issues detached from the two letters AV, and in others attached.
33 rpm - Royal series.
As mentioned before, the Royal (whose headquarters was in Via Indipendenza 32 in Naples) was specialized in the launch of new artists, and was shortly after incorporated into the parent company: for this reason the first issues have only the writing Royal, then replaced from Durium - Royal Series, while the numbering of the catalogue continues sequentially and continues with the Royal series. The letter A is found in some issues detached from the two letters QC, and in others attached.

Battle off Halifax (1780)

The Battle off Halifax took place on 10 July 1780 during the American Revolutionary War. The British privateer "Resolution" fought the American privateer "Viper" and heavy casualties were suffered by both sides. The battle was "one of the bloodiest battles in the history of privateering... a loss of 51 lives in a single battle was virtually unheard of."
Background.
During the American Revolution, Americans regularly attacked Nova Scotia by land and sea. American privateers devastated the maritime economy by raiding many of the coastal communities, such as the numerous raids on Liverpool and on Annapolis Royal. A few months before the Battle of Halifax, in December 1779 the schooner "Hope" wrecked near the Sambro Island Light on the Three Sisters Rocks. Captain Henry Baldwin and six other crew were killed. Weeks later, 170 British sailors were lost when two vessels - "North" and "St Helena" - were wrecked in a storm when entering Halifax harbour.
Battle.
Just off Sambro Island Light, the American privateer "Viper" (22 guns, 130 men), under the command of William Williams took the British brig "Resolution" (16 guns) under the command of Captain Thomas Ross of Halifax. In the "hot engagement" for 90 minutes, the British had killed 8 and 10 wounded, while the American killed and wounded totalled 33 men. Both vessels were much disabled and the British surrendered.
Aftermath.
American privateers remained a threat to Nova Scotian ports for the rest of the war. For example, after a failed attempt to raid Chester, Nova Scotia, American privateers struck again in the Raid on Lunenburg in 1782.

Maude Edith Victoria Fleay

Maude Edith Victoria Glover Fleay (1869–1965), was one of Australia's first wildlife artists. She was known for her paintings of Australian marsupials.
Biography.
Fleay was born in 1869 in Sulky Gully, Australia. She studied drawing at the School of Mines, Ballarat, where she was taught by David Davies.

In 1938 she exhibited at the Athenaeum Gallery with fellow women artists Annie Gates and Henrietta Maria Gulliver. Glover Fleay exhibited at the Leighton Galleries in 1945 where her work was commended for its "rather unfeminine strength and confidence of approach." Noted artist Arthur Streeton said her paintings "reflect great sympathy with and knowledge of the animals." She was also a writer and music teacher, and art director of the Daylesford School of Mines.
In 1905 she married William Henry Fleay at St. Peter's Church of England, Sturt Street, Ballarat. They had three children, including the naturalist David Fleay. She brought out a book with David, "Gliders of the Gumtrees," for which she did the illustrations.

The Fortress in Badaber

The Fortress in Badaber () is a Russian TV series about the events that occurred during the Afghan War. In the center of the plot is an uprising in the camp of Badaber. The uprising in Badaber camp was an episode of the Afghan war, during which on April 26, 1985 an unequal battle took place between the detachments of Afghan Mujahideen and the units of the regular Pakistani Army supporting them, on the one hand, and a group of Soviet and Afghan prisoners of war, on the other. The attempt of prisoners of war to free themselves from the camp failed. As a result of the two-day storming of the Badaber camp with the use artillery, the majority of prisoners of war were killed. The film, however, was created to show the union of Russians, and to show what the Russian hostages of the camp in Badaber went through.
Plot.
Afghanistan, spring of the 1985th. A column of the Soviet servicemen near the border with Pakistan detects the Soviet soldier who is tied with barbed wire to the barrier by "mujahideen", who using the proximity of the border, constantly make raids to the neighboring territory. In Pakistan, in the fortress of Badaber, under the leadership of American instructors, militants are being trained. There is a need of an operation in Pakistan to neutralize them. The Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union will give an order to get rid of the fortress only after conducting the reconnaissance operation. The responsible for this must be the General Kolesov. The contractor must be the captain of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), Yuri Nikitin. Kolesov personally arrives at the house of Nikitin, outside Moscow, where Nikitin, suspended from operations, lives with his wife Svetlana. However, she does not want to let her husband go to Afghanistan. Under the instructions of the GRU, the scout, Yuri Nikitin, disguised as a slave, enters the Pakistan fortress of Badaber. Nikitin must collect evidence of the existence of a training center for "mujaheddin" under the leadership of the CIA, and then, he must to send a signal to the Russian commanders that they send missiles to blow the base. Yuri makes a few shots, but because of the threat to be declassified, he throws the camera at the last moment. Then, he meets the local goldsmith who shows Nikitin the Soviet soldier medallions, one of which belongs to Nikitin's best friend – Mikhail Kolesov, who is already considered to be missing in the Soviet Union. So, Nikitin understands that in the fortress there is a secret prisoners of war camp – the Soviet soldiers – who are kept and may suffer during the storming of Badaber. In this way, contrary to the original task of the GRU, the scout joins his compatriots. Nikitin goes into the fortress and sees on the territory of the fortress a group of Russian prisoners of war, among whom he recognizes his best friend Mikhail, the son of his commander, General Kolesov, who was considered missing for several years. Nikitin decided to stay and save the doomed to death the Russian soldiers. Once imprisoned, he inspires them to revolt.

In the United States, he became a person of interest in multiple investigations regarding Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, particularly due to his ties with Paul Manafort, an American political consultant, who was a campaign chairman for Donald Trump.
Kilimnik was reported by CNN, "The New York Times" and "The Atlantic" to be "Person A" listed in court documents filed by the Special Counsel against Manafort. He is also believed to be Person A in court documents filed in the criminal indictment of Alex van der Zwaan. The April 2019 Mueller Report concluded Kilimnik was connected to Russian intelligence agencies, while the August 2020 final report on 2016 election interference from the Senate Intelligence Committee characterized him as a "Russian intelligence officer". In 2017, Kilimnik denied having ties to Russian intelligence agencies. Kilimnik was indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's grand jury on 8 June 2018 on charges of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice by attempting to tamper with a witness on behalf of Manafort.
United States intelligence community analysis released in March 2021 found that Kilimnik was among proxies of Russian intelligence who promoted and laundered misleading or unsubstantiated narratives about Joe Biden "to US media organizations, US officials, and prominent US individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration" to benefit the 2020 Trump presidential campaign. In April 2021, the US Treasury Department sanctioned Kilimnik for providing Russian intelligence with "sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy" provided to him by Manafort from the Trump campaign, and for promoting the false narrative that Ukraine, rather than Russia, had interfered in the 2016 election.
Early life.
Kilimnik was born on 27 April 1970 at Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine, Soviet Union. Fluent in Russian and Ukrainian before his service in the Soviet Army, he became fluent in Swedish and English as a linguist at the Moscow Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense, which trained interpreters for the Soviet Union's Main Intelligence Directorate, known as the GRU of the Soviet Union. He was a translator in the Soviet Army and worked closely with its GRU. He took Russian citizenship after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. He worked in Sweden as an interpreter for a Russian arms dealer.
Kilimnik worked for the International Republican Institute (IRI) in Moscow from 1995 to early 2005; the IRI is an organisation which receives funding from the United States government to support democracy. According to anonymous sources, when applying for his position with the IRI, he responded to the question about how he learned English by stating that the "Russian military intelligence" taught him and he became known among Moscow political operatives as "Kostya, the guy from the GRU". In 1997, he traveled to the United States using a Russian diplomatic passport. "The New York Times" reported two former IRI colleagues said Kilminik was dismissed in April 2005 after the chief of Russian Federation's Federal Security Service gave a speech discussing internal private meetings at the Institute. Kilminik was suspected of leaking details of an IRI meeting in Bratislava, Slovakia. Kilimnik himself told "The New York Times" in April 2018 that he had been dismissed for having freelanced as an interpreter for Manafort, which was effectively confirmed by a spokesman for the IRI who said such an action ran counter to the organization's code of ethics. Nearly a year later, an IRI representative declined in February 2019, to say whether Kliminik leaving the organisation had any connection to Kilimnik's alleged links to Russian intelligence. In the Mueller Report, a former colleague is reported to have told the FBI that Kilimnik was fired because of his strong links to Russian intelligence services.
Employment by Manafort.
Recruited by Philip M. Griffin as a translator for oligarch Rinat Akhmetov and seeking a better income than available at IRI, Kilimnik met Paul Manafort in 2005 and became an employee of Manafort's consulting firm. After the end of his association with IRI in April 2005, he lived and worked in Kyiv and Moscow while his wife and two children remained in Moscow living in a modest house near the Sheremetyevo International Airport. Some reports say Kilimnik ran the Kyiv office of Manafort's firm, Davis Manafort International, and was Manafort's right-hand man in Kyiv. They began working for Viktor Yanukovych after the 2004 Orange Revolution cost him the Presidency. With help from Manafort and Kilimnik, Yanukovych became President in 2010. Kilimnik told RFE/RL in February 2017 that he spent 90% of his time inside the Presidential administration, and assisted Manafort. From 2011 to 2013, with liaison to Viktor Yanukovych's chief of staff Serhiy Lyovochkin, Kilimnik, Manafort, Alan Friedman, Eckart Sager, who was a one time CNN producer, and Rick Gates advised on an international public relations strategy. This effort supported the administration of President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych hired Manafort's company Global Endeavour, a St. Vincent and Grenadines based consulting and lobbying company, which during the end of Yanukovych's presidency transferred $750,000 out of Ukraine and also paid Kilimnik $53,000 during November and December 2013. When Yanukovych fled the country, Manafort and Kilimnik gained employment with the Ukrainian party Opposition Bloc which is backed by the same oligarchs who backed Yanukovych. At some point, Opposition Bloc ceased paying Manafort's firm but even though the non-payment forced Manafort's firm to shut down their Kyiv office, Kilimnik continued to advise the party while working to collect unpaid fees for Manafort's firm.
Around 2010, Kilimnik collaborated with Rinat Akhmetshin when the Washington-based lobbyist was trying to sell a book disparaging one of Yanukovych's opponents.
Kilimnik and Manafort actively assisted Ukrainian oligarchs and Russian oligarchs who are close to the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin. Also, they worked to ensure that Viktor Yanukovych and his Party of Regions would reduce and eventually sever Ukraine's ties to the United States and Europe so that Ukraine would become much closer to Russia, the Kremlin, and Vladimir Putin.
In a February 22, 2017, interview with Christopher Miller of "Radio Free Europe", Kilimnik explained the existence of a peace effort between Russia and Ukraine called the "Mariupol Plan" in which Viktor Yanukovych would return as president of Russia's illegally controlled regions and Crimea in Ukraine. Andriy Artemenko's peace plan was known as the "New initiative for Peace".
In 2017, Kilimnik helped Manafort write an op-ed for a Kyiv newspaper. A journalist in Ukraine, Oleg Voloshyn, has disputed this assertion stating that he and Manafort wrote the op-ed and that he e-mailed the rough draft to Kilimnik. The op-ed may have violated a gag order issued against Manafort by a US court and may have been a breach of Manafort's bail conditions.
In 2018, CNBC reported Kilimnik to be variously "described as a fixer, translator or office manager to President Donald Trump’s ex-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.
Prosecutor General of Ukraine investigation of Kilimnik.
From August until December 2016, Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yuriy Lutsenko conducted an investigation into Konstantin Kilimnik but did not arrest him. Kilimnik managed Davis Manafort International in Kyiv. Kilimnik left Ukraine for Russia in June 2016. Davis Manafort International in Kyiv had been accused of money laundering by Robert Mueller's Special Counsel investigation. Mueller considered Kilimnik a vital witness in the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau informed the United States Department of State that Lutsenko had both thwarted Ukraine's investigation into Kilimink and allowed Kilimnik to leave Ukraine for Russia.
Mentions in court filings.
Kilimnik has been reported by "The New York Times" to be the "Person A" in Court filings in December 2017 against Manafort and Rick Gates.
Court filings in late March 2018 allege that he knew that Kilimnik was a former officer with the Russian military intelligence service. These came after Gates reached a plea deal in exchange for cooperation in the investigation. The sentencing memo for Alex van der Zwaan filed by Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller states that Gates told van der Zwaan that Person A, believed to be Kilimnik, was a former intelligence officer with the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).
Kilimnik also featured in the documents filed by Mueller in early December 2018 that explained why he believed Manafort had lied to investigators during the investigation conducted by Mueller's team.
Indictment.
On 8 June 2018, Kilimnik was indicted by Mueller on charges of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice, in conjunction with Manafort, regarding unregistered lobbying work. According to their 2021 website, "The FBI is offering a reward of up to $250,000 for information leading to the arrest of Konstantin Viktorovich Kilimnik."
Connection to the Trump campaign.
Through numerous regular email exchanges, Kilimnik conferred with Manafort after Manafort became Donald Trump's campaign manager in April 2016 and requested that Manafort give "private briefings" about the Trump campaign to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire and close ally to Vladimir Putin. On 2 August 2016, Kilimnik met with Manafort and Rick Gates at the Grand Havana Room at 666 Fifth Avenue. The encounter which, according to prosecutor Andrew Weissmann goes “very much to the heart of what the special counsel’s office is investigating,” included a handoff by Manafort of internal polling data from Trump’s presidential campaign to Kilimnik. Gates later testified the three left the premises separately, each using different exits.
According Mueller's court filings, Kilimnik was still working with Russian intelligence when, during September and October 2016, he was known to be communicating with the Trump campaign. Both Rick Gates and Paul Manafort were in contact with him at the time. Manafort has said that he and Kilimnik discussed the Democratic National Committee cyber attack and release of emails, now known to be undertaken by Russian hacker groups known as Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear.
Kilimnik and Manafort had been involved in the Pericles Fund together, an unsuccessful business venture financed by Oleg Deripaska. In July 2016, Manafort told Kilimnik to offer Deripaska private information in exchange for resolving multimillion-dollar disputes about the venture.
In a 2018 classified State Department assessment Ukraine’s former Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko allowed Kilimnik to escape from Ukraine to Russia after the US federal grand jury charged Kilimnik with obstruction of justice. "The New York Times" reported on 31 August 2018 that an unnamed Russian political operative and a Ukrainian businessman had illegally purchased four tickets to the inauguration of Donald Trump on behalf of Kilimnik. The tickets, valued at $50,000, were purchased with funds that had flowed through a Cypriot bank account. The transaction was facilitated by Sam Patten, an American lobbyist who had related work with Paul Manafort and pleaded guilty to failing to register as a foreign agent. Kilimnik attended Trump's inauguration.
In January 2019, Manafort's lawyers submitted a filing to the court, in response to the Special Counsel's accusation that he had lied to investigators while supposedly co-operating with them. Through an error in redacting, the document accidentally revealed that while he was campaign chairman, Manafort met with Kilimnik, gave him polling data related to the 2016 campaign, and discussed a Ukrainian peace plan with him. Most of the polling data was reportedly public, although some was private Trump campaign polling data. Manafort asked Kilimnik to pass the data to Ukrainians Serhiy Lyovochkin and Rinat Akhmetov. Manafort also asked Kilimnik to pass polling data to Oleg Deripaska who is close to Putin.
In its August 2020 final report on the 2016 election interference, the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee characterized Kilimnik as a "Russian intelligence officer" who worked with Manafort while he was Trump campaign manager to deflect suspicions of interference away from Russia and onto Ukraine. The report mentions Kilimnik about 800 times, although most of the details about his intelligence connections were redacted. However, the sharing of intelligence with Kilimnik by Mandfort and others "represented a grave counterintelligence threat". The committee acquired sufficient evidence to assert that Kilminik may have been involved directly in the plot, not only to hack the Democrats computers, but to pass on the information to WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group. This effort became a major element of conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal promoted by President Trump and his associates.
In April 2021, the US Treasury Department sanctioned Kilimnik for providing Russian intelligence with "sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy" provided to him by Manafort from the Trump campaign, and for promoting the false narrative that Ukraine, rather than Russia, had interfered in the 2016 election. A Treasury spokesman declined to relay further information to NBC News about the new intelligence on the issue. The Associated Press reported it was the first occasion the United States government had made such a strong connection between campaign of Donald Trump and Russian intelligence.
Russian residence.
Since at least August 2018, Kilimnik and his wife have been living in a $2 million home in a heavily guarded elite gated community in Khimki, north-west of the Moscow Region outside the Moscow Ring Road (MKAD). The area is the base of the Moscow unit of the GRU unit accused by Mueller in a July 2018 indictment of tacking the lead in the hacking emails of the Democats in 2016.

Anna Mangin

Anna M. Mangin (October 1844 - March 1, 1931) was an American inventor, educator, caterer and women's rights campaigner. She invented a kitchen tool she called a pastry fork in 1891. This was different from the eating utensil also known as a pastry fork.
Early life.
It is believed that Anna M. Mangin was born Anna Matilda Barker in October 1844 in the state of Louisiana. On her 1877 marriage application, she listed her parents as Jacob Barker and one P. [Polly?] Shelton. Jacob Barker was a prosperous planter, merchant and politician who was in his late sixties at the time of Annie's birth. It is of note that Barker, a native of Maine, worked closely with Rhode Island merchant Rowland G. Hazard who, using Louisiana state laws, was able to free over one hundred Northern-born African-Americans who had been enslaved. It is possible that Annie arrived in Nantucket, Massachusetts through the ministrations of Barker, Hazard, and African-American minister, activist, orator and Underground Railroad conductor Charles Bennett Ray; it is known that Annie was taken in by Ray's sister, seamstress and business woman Elizabeth S. Ray and her husband, shoemaker and merchant Abraham M. Nahar, a native of Surinam. Annie was adopted by the childless couple and was known as Annie Mattie Nahar.
As Nantucket local historian Frances Karttunen observed:"[b]ack in 1845, entrepreneur Abraham Nahar and his seamstress wife Elizabeth had joined 102 other members of Nantucket’s New Guinea community in signing a petition to the Massachusetts legislature seeking relief from segregation of Nantucket’s public schools. The success of the struggle to integrate the island’s schools meant that Annie Mattie was educated along with white and non-white children at the South School on Orange Street. One of her contemporaries recalled that. “To one unacquainted she would, unquestionably, have passed for a white girl, yet she was of African parentage, was true to and dwelt with colored people. She was a young woman of rare character and attractiveness.”"
Career As Educator.
As the American Civil War commenced, Annie Nahar was a student at the Nantucket High School. Heeding the call of Nantucket native and Quaker activist Anna Gardner for teachers to go South to educate the freedmen, in June 1864, Annie left Nantucket for New Orleans, where she taught school for four years under the auspices of the Freedmen's Bureau, before moving to San Antonio, Texas
In 1870, Annie returned to New Orleans, where she took on the position of principal of the Coliseum School. By 1873, she had moved to lodgings at the corner of Napoleon avenue and Dryades street.
By 1877 Annie was the "principal of one of the McDonogh Schools that had been established from a bequest by a wealthy slave owner who left his estate for the support of free schools for children regardless of color" when she met Andrew Fitch Mangin, a thirty-four year old African-American native of Monroe, New York who was employed at various times as a coachman and a teamster. He was described as a man with "more than average natural shrewdness and intelligence."
On August 17, 1877, Andrew and Annie married in New Orleans and moved to New York City where Annie embarked on a new career as a cook and as a caterer while Andrew went into business with his brothers and operated a hauling and moving business from a yard on Gold Street in Manhattan On January 7, 1879, Annie gave birth to their only surviving child, a son she named for his father.
Moves to Woodside, New York.
Soon after the family's return to the North, Andrew Mangin bought a building lot on Fifth Street in the Winfield section of Woodside, New York in the county of Queens and after he built a small house on that lot he moved his family there. He continued transacting the freight business with his brothers until 1895, when he opened up a coal yard on that lot. Annie Mangin, along with her catering business, was also "teaching some of the colored children in Woodside."
Major contribution.
Anna M. Mangin made a major contribution to everyday domesticated household needs in the 19th century. Her invention was the pastry fork. 
To hear Andrew Mangin tell it, his wife first came up with the concept of a simplified manner of making pastry by an improvement to the pastry fork, and "then and there described it to him. The description was so clear and minute that Mr. Mangin often says, when speaking of the incident, 'I saw that fork just as plain as I see you now.' " Andrew Mangin went out to his tool shed and whittled a prototype of the fork out of yellow pine. Once Anna approved the model, Andrew had a more substantive model of the fork made, first from iron, and then from white metal. Anna Mangin received the patent for the pastry fork on March 1, 1892.
The pastry fork had many uses, including beating eggs, thickening foods, making drawn butter, mashing potatoes, making salad dressings, and most importantly, kneading pastry dough. "The curved piece at the upper end of the handle is what Mrs. Mangin calls the cutter or trimmer for pie crust." The pastry fork improved the lives of many people, and eventually led to more electric mixing inventions that are used to this day. Kneading pastry dough by hand is a grueling process that can cause arm cramping and other pains. Also, the dough often does not get fully incorporated when mixed by hand. If the dough does not fully incorporate during the kneading process, then it will not rise, resulting in a dense, and in most cases, underbaked consistency. 
Exhibition.
Anna Mangin's pastry fork was displayed at the New York Afro-American Exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. The exhibit was located in the women's exhibit building on the second floor, where Mangin had a corner area to showcase the invention.
Later Years.
Anna Mangin was active in community based activities. To take one example, in January 1907, she participated in a charity fair held on behalf of the Women's Loyal Union that supported the Industrial and Protective Union House for Working Girls in Brooklyn, New York. Mrs. Mangin helped operate the Star Booth, chaired by librarian Florence T. Ray and staffed by a number of ladies including H. Cordelia Ray, Susan Elizabeth Frazier and Carrie Fortune, the wife of newspaper publisher Timothy Thomas Fortune.
After Andrew Mangin's death later in 1907, his widow and their son closed the coal yard but remained on the property until 1925 when Andrew Mangin, Jr. purchased a chicken farm in Brookfield, Connecticut, and both mother and son moved there.
Anna Mangin died in a hospital in Danbury, Connecticut on Sunday, March 1, 1931 and was buried in the Mangin family plot in Evergreens Cemetery on Wednesday, the 4th.
