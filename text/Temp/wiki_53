CastroVerde (political party)

CastroVerde () is a green municipal political party in Castro Urdiales (Cantabria, Spain) created in 2011 by members of various local social movements and platforms. Among its members and founders are people linked to associations such as Another Castro is Possible, the Platform to Save the Bay or the Platform to save the Peña de Santullán. 
History.
In its founding manifesto "Castro, I love you green", the party defends the need to "dignify political life" and "direct the municipality towards economic and environmental sustainability", based on "projects related to municipal organization, resource planning and urban planning, as well as the relationship with the Neighborhood Councils and the Government of Cantabria". Another of the priorities of CastroVerde is citizen participation, based on participation councils, popular consultation and voluntary work.
CastroVerde participated in the municipal elections on May 22, 2011. The list presented obtained 2,229 votes (15.84%) and four seats of the 21 that make up the City Council of Castro Urdiales. CastroVerde won the municipal elections of May 24, 2015, obtaining 7 city councilors and the mayor of Castro Urdiales. In 2017 CastroVerde broke the coalition with the local Socialist Party, since then the party has a minority government.

Fletcher Magee

Fletcher Magee (born November 13, 1996) is an American basketball player for Studentski centar of the Montenegrin Basketball League. He played college basketball for Wofford College. While playing for the Terriers, he was named the Southern Conference Player of the Year by the league's media in consecutive years (2017–18 and 2018–19) and set the NCAA record for made three point shots in a career.
High school career.
Magee played three sports at The First Academy in his native Orlando, Florida. 
College career.
As a freshman for Wofford, he scored 13.8 points per game and led the Southern Conference (SoCon) in three-point shooting percentage. At the close of the season, he was named SoCon Freshman of the Year. As a sophomore, Magee raised his scoring average to 18.6 points per game and was named first-team all-conference.
As a junior, Magee led the SoCon in scoring at 22.1 points per game and again led the league in three-point percentage (.439). At the close of the season, he was awarded the Malcolm U. Pitt SoCon Player of the Year by the league media.
Following the 2017–18 season, Magee declared his intention to test the waters for the 2018 NBA draft. He did not hire an agent, leaving open the possibility of returning to Wofford for his senior year, which he did. Coming into his senior season, Magee was named preseason Southern Conference Player of the Year.
On December 9, 2018, Magee scored his 2,000th career point in a win over Coastal Carolina. At the close of the season, Magee was again named SoCon Player of the Year by the league's media, this time adding the Coaches' award to sweep top honors.
On March 21, 2019, against Seton Hall, Fletcher broke the all-time NCAA record for most career three point field goals, surpassing JJ Redick, Stephen Curry, and Travis Bader, who previously had 504, in the First Round of the NCAA Tournament.

Necrobiome

The necrobiome has been defined as the community of species associated with decaying corpse remains. The process of decomposition is complex. Microbes decompose cadavers, but other organisms including fungi, nematodes, insects, and larger scavenger animals also contribute. Once the immune system is no longer active, microbes colonizing the intestines and lungs decompose their respective tissues and then travel throughout the body via the blood and lymphatic systems to break down other tissue and bone. During this process, gases are released as a by-product and accumulate, causing bloating. Eventually, the gases seep through the body’s wounds and natural openings, providing a way for some microbes to exit from the inside of the cadaver and inhabit the outside. The microbial communities colonizing the internal organs of a cadaver are referred to as the thanatomicrobiome. The region outside of the cadaver that is exposed to the external environment is referred to as the epinecrotic portion of the necrobiome, and is especially important when determining the time and location of death for an individual. Different microbes play specific roles during each stage of the decomposition process. The microbes that will colonize the cadaver and the rate of their activity are determined by the cadaver itself and the cadaver’s surrounding environmental conditions.
History.
There is textual evidence that human cadavers were first studied around the third century BC to gain an understanding of human anatomy. Many of the first human cadaver studies took place in Italy, where the earliest record of determining the cause of death from a human corpse dates back to 1286. However, understanding of the human body progressed slowly, in part because the spread of Christianity and other religious beliefs resulted in human dissection becoming illegal. Thus, non-human animals were solely dissected for anatomical understanding until the 13th century when officials realized human cadavers were necessary for a better understanding of the human body. It was not until 1676 that Antonie van Leeuwenhoek designed a lens that made it possible to visualize microbes, and not until the late 18th century when microbes were considered useful in understanding the body after death. Modern sophisticated molecular techniques have made it possible to identify the microbial communities that inhabit and decompose cadavers, but more advanced research is fairly new, and therefore poorly understood. Studying the necrobiome has become increasingly useful in determining the time and cause of death. so more recent research can have crime-solving applications.
Necrobiome applications.
Forensic entomology.
Forensic entomology, the study of insects (arthropods) found in decomposing humans is the most popular field of study used in determining the post-mortem interval (PMI). This technique, however, is still new and consistently being improved, and—as such—it can work well with other techniques such as forensic anthropology, though forensic entomology is not as dependable on its own yet. Forensic entomologists often work within the field of crime scene investigations and are a part of the crime scene expert team that analyzes and collects evidence regarding a suspicious death. Typically, the minimum education required for this particular position is a Doctorate in Forensic Science. Forensic entomologists are experts in their field, and thus require a professional certification with the American Board of Forensic Entomology. As another relatively new field, forensic microbiologists, studying the presence of microbes, began investigating ways to determine time and place of death by analyzing the microbes present on the corpse. This would become an integral part of crime solving in later years upon the invention of the microbial clock process. The microbial timeline in which the body decays has been given the term “microbial clock,” this estimates how long a body has been in a certain place based on microbes present or missing. The succession of bacterial species populating the body after a period of four days is an indicator of minimum time since death (MTD). The presence or absence of maggots, as well as their age, can also be used to determine time of death; If the maggot is only a few days old, then the cadaver could not have been dead for longer than this time.
Microbial forensics.
As the necrobiome deals with the various communities of bacteria and organisms that catalyze the decomposition of plants and animals (See Figure 1), this particular biome is an increasingly vital part of forensic science. The microbes occupying the space underneath and around a decomposing body are unique to it—similar to how fingerprints are exclusively unique to only one person. Using this differentiation, forensic investigators at a crime scene are able to distinguish between burial sites. This would provide concrete factual information about how long the body has been there and the predicted area in which the death possibly occurred. As the progression of research regarding microbial forensics and the necrobiome continues to be refined and improved, the need for new forensic scientists and microbiologists becomes increasingly necessary. When a crime such as murder has transpired, a team of crime scene specialists or forensic science experts are called to the scene to collect evidence and examine the body. These experts range from forensic odontologists to forensic microbiologists (See Figure 2). Together, they can obtain the necessary elements needed in order to properly reconstruct the victim’s demise.
Cadavers and carcasses.
One way many people study how bodies decompose is through the use of body farms. There are seven research facilities in the US that are home to body farms: University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Western Carolina University, Texas State University, Sam Houston State University, Southern Illinois University, Colorado Mesa University, and University of South Florida. These facilities study the decomposition of cadavers in all possible manners of decay, including in open or frozen environments, buried underground, or within cars. Through the study of the cadavers, experts examine the microbial timeline and document what’s normal in each stage in the various locations that each body is placed. An experiment was conducted to study the change in the necrobiome within a carcass and they performed it. The experiment was conducted to study the relative abundance of organisms in the necrobiome and the changes that occur during three different stages. For the experiment, they used six dead rabbits purchased from a pet food company. The rabbits were purchased from Kiezebank and exposed on top of a roof at the University of Huddersfield in West Yorkshire, United Kingdom. The rabbits were dead prior to purchase. Three of the rabbits’ fur were removed from the torso to identify any difference in necrobiome abundance. Samples were collected from inside of the mouth, the upper skin of the torso exposed to the air environment, and the bottom skin of the torso that’s touched by the soil. Active, advanced, and decay stages were examined, and proteobacteria were the most abundant present, followed by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria during the active stage of decomposition (Figure 3). During the advanced stage of decomposition, Proteobacteria decreased from 99.4% to 81.6% in the oral cavity but were most abundant in the non-fur samples. It was distinguished that Firmicutes were the most abundant for the skin samples in both fur and non-fur samples. Finally, Proteobacteria was most abundant in the soil interface during the beginning of decomposition in both fur and non-fur samples. Also, they noted that Actinobacteria was the least abundant in the active stage and decreased even more during the dry stage.
Decomposition.
The manner in which bacteria colonize a cadaver is predictable when examining the time since death. Only recent studies have taken place to determine if bacteria alone can inform the postmortem interval. Bacteria responsible for decomposing cadavers can be difficult to study because the bacteria found on a cadaver varies and changes quickly. Bacteria can be brought to a cadaver by scavengers, air, or water. Other environmental factors like temperature and soil can impact the microbes found on a cadaver. Fortunately, microbial colonization between humans and animals is so similar, that animal models can be used to understand the decomposition process for humans. Human cadavers are used for research, but animal models provide larger sample sizes and produce more controlled studies. Swine models have been used repeatedly to understand the human decomposition process in terrestrial environments. Swine are suitable for studying human decomposition because of their size, sparse hairs, and similar bacteria found in their GI tracts.
Technology and techniques.
An algorithm has been developed to accurately predict time since death with an accuracy of within two days.
Techniques for analyzing the necrobiome have now been coupled with forensic entomology, such as phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, total soil fatty acid methyl esters, and DNA profiling. Pig carcasses have also become a tool to understand human microbiology, minimizing the issue of variation that exists when using human cadavers as study subjects. This technology is used to simplify the sample collection into sequences that scientists can read. The simplified sequence of the necrobiome is run through a data bank to match the name of it. Due to the lack of universal algorithm technology, there is a knowledge gap in various platforms across different regions of the world. In order to close that gap, there needs to be an expansion of the technology. However, there are a few obstacles, including identifying needs, research, prototype development, acceptance, and adoption. Overcoming these obstacles would assist many organizations that are involved with forensic science. Also, it would increase the understanding of the necrobiome and growth of developing a successful accurate multi-step experiment. The samples are loaded into a machine to generate and analyze DNA sequences of the microbiome. Algorithms are done in a lab on a computer program to read and match the sequences within the data bank. The results return very quickly within a few minutes to the latest days.

Cortes (miniseries)

Cortés was a planned American historical drama streaming television miniseries created and written by Steven Zaillian and starring Javier Bardem. The series was set to premiere on Amazon Prime Video before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, but was ultimately canceled in late 2020 before production resumed.
Premise.
The four-episode series was to follow "the legendary conqueror, Hernán Cortés, who led a rebellious expedition to the heart of King Moctezuma II’s Aztec Empire, connecting two civilizations for the first time and changing the course of history."
Production.
Development.
In 1965, screenwriter Dalton Trumbo finished a 205-page draft of a screenplay entitled "Montezuma", with a story centered around the complicated relationship between Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés and Aztec leader Moctezuma II. The film was written with intent of having Martin Ritt direct and Kirk Douglas play the role of Cortés. The production ultimately never came together.
In 2014, it was reported that Steven Spielberg was considering directing "Montezuma" from a screenplay written by Steven Zaillian based on the original script by Trumbo. It was further reported that the film might be retitled "Cortes" as the new screenplay featured him as the main character.
On March 26, 2018, it was announced that the project had been redeveloped from a film into a television miniseries and that Amazon had given it an order for four episodes. The series was created and written by Steven Zaillian who is also set to executive produce alongside Spielberg, Darryl Frank, Justin Falvey, and Javier Bardem. On October 3, 2019, it was reported that Ciro Guerra and Cristina Gallegos would direct the miniseries, while Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna would executive produce.
The series was to be filmed in Spanish, Nahuatl and Chontal Mayan, from scripts translated by David Bowles. However, in September 2020, Amazon decided to withdraw from its partnership with Amblin on the miniseries, effectively scrapping the project due to complications from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Casting.
Alongside the initial series announcement, it was confirmed that Javier Bardem, who was initially attached to the project when it was a feature film, had been cast in the lead role of Hernán Cortés. In February 2020, it was further announced that Tenoch Huerta will play Moctezuma II, Aztec Emperor, while Yoshira Escárrega takes on the role of Malintzin or Marina, the strategic partner, translator and consort of Hernán Cortés.
Ammar Aldieri will play the role of Tapeia.

The Elizabethtown Armory, at 205 Warfield St. in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, was built in 1948. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.
It is a two-story yellow brick Modern Movement-style building with a two-story five-bay central block and one-story wings.
It was deemed significant "because of its association with the National Guard in Elizabethtown, and for its use as a community center for the citizens of the city. Besides its military duties, the armory has served as a community center for Elizabethtown. The Guard used to hold an annual bean soup dinner at the armory, and wrestling matches, basketball games, trade shows, and wedding receptions all take place in the armory drill hall."

Russian Indoor Athletics Championships

The Russian Indoor Athletics Championships () is an annual indoor track and field competition organised by the All-Russia Athletic Federation (ARAF), which serves as the Russian national championship for the sport. It was first held in 1992, following the independence of Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and replacing the Soviet Indoor Athletics Championships. It is typically held as a three-day event in the Russian winter around mid to late February. The venue of the championships is usually in Moscow or Volgograd. A total of 24 athletics events are on the current programme, divided evenly between the sexes.
The first edition of the event in 1992 was poorly attended by the nation's best athletes, as a CIS Indoor Championships was also held the same year and was involved with international selection for the Unified Team.
Events.
The following athletics events feature as standard on the Russian Indoor Championships programme:

Kalavani 2

Kalavani 2 () is a 2019 Indian Tamil-language romantic comedy film directed and produced by A. Sarkunam. The film stars Vimal and Oviya, with RJ Vigneshkanth amongst others in supporting roles. A sequel to "Kalavani" (2010), the film began production in February 2018. The film was released on 5 July 2019 to negative reviews.
Plot.
Arivazhagan (Vimal) continues his fraudulent existence with a new friend Vicky (RJ Vigneshkanth) in tow. When the Panchayat elections are announced Arivazhagan 's uncle and his lover Maheswari (Oviya) father are contesting for the Local body elections. The Kalavani plans to file nomination on his own hoping that either side would pay him off to avoid splitting of votes and cheats Panchayat (Ganja Karuppu) to finance this scheme.
Production.
Upon release in 2010, "Kalavani", produced by Nazir, had become a surprise success and performed well at the box office, effectively making the careers of director Sarkunam, actor Vimal and actress Oviya. In November 2016, reports emerged that Sarkunam and Vimal were coming together for a sequel but Sarkunam continued to concentrate on the pre-production of a film starring Madhavan. In October 2017, Vimal denied signing the film and dispelled reports that a sequel was in production for producer Nazir.
In a turn of events in February 2018, Sarkunam shelved his proposed film with Madhavan and announced that he would make a sequel to "Kalavani". He launched his own production house, Varmans Productions, to fund the film and cast Vimal Oviya, while titling the project as "K2". Soon after Sarkunam's announcement, Nazir revealed that he was unhappy at this proposal, and that he would begin work on a separate film titled "Kalavani 2" as he had the original rights to the title. He suggested that production would begin in mid-2018 after he had finished making a film titled "Vadam" with Poonam Kaur.
Despite the ongoing issue, Sarkunam began shooting the film with Vimal in February 2018, with Oviya joining the team in May 2018. Several members of the original film's cast joined the project, except Soori, with Vigneshkanth signed on instead.

Joe Musgrave

Joseph William Musgrave (29 February 1908 – 1981) was an English footballer who played as a left-half or inside-left in the Football League for West Ham United, Swindon Town and Hartlepools United.
Musgrave played non-league football with Willington and Spennymoor United before joining West Ham United in 1931. His first game came against Manchester United on 14 February, along with fellow debutant Reg Goodacre. He scored his first and only League goal for the club in a 3–2 win over Blackpool on 11 April 1931, and ended his debut season with seven First Division appearances.
Musgrave played mainly for the reserve team and managed just three League appearances in 1931–32. The following season, after the Hammers had been relegated to the Second Division, he made 23. He also made four appearances in the FA Cup and scored his only other goal for the club in a fifth-round tie against Brighton and Hove Albion on 18 February 1933. The following three seasons saw Musgrave make a further three appearances and he did not play any first-team football in 1934–35.
After seven seasons at Upton Park, he had made a total of 40 league and cup appearances for the club, scoring two goals. His last game came on 25 January 1936, a 2–0 win over Doncaster Rovers and he left the club for Swindon Town two days later.
Mugrave's two-season tenure at Swindon Town saw three goals in 23 Third Division South games, and a single FA Cup appearance. He went on to join Hartlepools United in 1938, where he matched that goal tally in 20 Third Division North appearances in 1931–32. A further appearance came in the Third Division North Cup against Darlington. After a single season at Pools, he returned to Spennymoor United.

It broke the record for longest-charting album by a female rapper on the "Billboard" 200, surpassing "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill", and has spent three full years on the chart. It is the most-streamed album by a female rapper on Spotify.
"Invasion of Privacy" was met with critical acclaim. A number of music publications included it among their lists of best albums of the year, with "Rolling Stone" and "Time" listing it at number one. Several publications ranked it among the best albums of the 2010s (decade) as well, with "Rolling Stone" placing it 34th. Among its accolades, it won Best Rap Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, with Cardi B becoming the first female rapper to win the category as a solo artist. It was also nominated for Album of the Year, with "I Like It" being nominated for Record of the Year and "Be Careful" for Best Rap Performance. It became the first female rap album in fifteen years to be nominated for Album of the Year. "Bodak Yellow" was nominated for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance for the previous ceremony. At the 2019 BET Awards, "Invasion of Privacy" won the BET Award for Album of the Year.
The album was made available for streaming and digital download on April 5, 2018, but was not available on any physical format upon its initial release. The album was eventually released on vinyl on December 7, 2018, and its CD release—initially scheduled for September 28, 2018—was released on February 22, 2019.
Background.
Prior to the release of the album, "Bodak Yellow" reached number one on the US "Billboard" Hot 100, while several collaborations also reached the top 10. Those singles set multiple chart records, including making her the first female rapper to land her first three entries in the top 10 of the Hot 100, and the first female artist to achieve the same on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. With her collaboration with Bruno Mars, "Finesse (Remix)", she became the first woman to have five top 10 singles simultaneously on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. In March 2018, Cardi announced at the iHeartRadio Music Awards that the album will be released in April. She announced the release date and the title posting the album artwork in her social media pages.
Recording and production.
"Invasion of Privacy" was recorded from 2017 until early 2018. It features production from 30 Roc, Allen Ritter, Andrew Watt, Ayo, Benny Blanco, Boi-1da, Cassius Jay, Cheeze Beatz, Craig Kallman, Cubeatz, DJ Mustard, DJ Official, DJ SwanQo, Frank Dukes, Invincible, J. White, Keyz, Klenard Raphael, Murda Beatz, Matt Allen, Needlz, NES, Nonstop Da Hitman, Scribz Riley, Tainy and Vinylz, among others.
Music and lyrics.
Primarily a hip hop album, "Invasion of Privacy" also comprises trap, Latin music and R&amp;B, while its lyrical themes include fame, success, wealth, sex, and feminism, as well as Cardi B's past. The album opens with "Get Up 10", which speaks about Cardi B's rise to fame. It is followed by a trap song "Drip", which features a guest appearance by Migos, and speaks about jewelry, wealth, and Cardi B and Migos' status. The third track "Bickenhead" has a feminist theme; its title refers to women who work hard for money.
A hip hop and trap song "Bodak Yellow" follows, on which Cardi B confronts her enemies and makes statements such as "I don't dance now, I make money moves", referring to her past, as she used to work as a stripper before rising to fame. On the fourth track "Be Careful", Cardi B performs the hook using a softly sung vocal style over a "laidback" beat. The song also comprises "flickering" hi-hats and "slick" synths. Lyrically, "Be Careful" is a song about infidelity, where the protagonist warns her cheating partner and asks him to treat her better. During an interview, Cardi B stated that she drew inspiration from past relationships, while denying that the song was directed at her fiancé Offset.
The sixth track "Best Life" features a guest appearance by Chance the Rapper; the lyrics discuss the power of God and positive thinking. It's followed by "I Like It", a bilingual (English and Spanish) latin trap song featuring singers Bad Bunny and J Balvin. "Invasion of Privacy" also contains two R&amp;B mid-tempo songs–"Ring" (featuring Kehlani) and "Thru Your Phone"–which both lyrically show Cardi B's emotional vulnerability.
"Ring" is followed by three hip hop and trap songs: "Money Bag", "Bartier Cardi" (featuring 21 Savage), and "She Bad" (with YG). On "Bartier Cardi", Cardi B raps about her attraction to diamonds, sports cars and sex, while 21 Savage raps about a similar theme from a male perspective.

Singles.
The album's lead single, "Bodak Yellow", was released on June 16, 2017. It topped the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart for three weeks. Cardi B became the first female rapper to have a song certified Diamond by the RIAA when "Bodak Yellow" received the certification in 2021.
"Bartier Cardi" was released on December 22, 2017, as the second single and features American rapper 21 Savage. It peaked at number 14 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 and was certified triple platinum by the RIAA.
"Be Careful" was released as the third single on March 30, 2018. It peaked at number 11 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 and was certified triple platinum by the RIAA.
"Drip" featuring Migos was released as a promotional single on April 4, 2018, despite being released to Australian radio on April 6, 2018. It peaked at number 21 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100. The song has been certified platinum by the RIAA.
"I Like It", with Bad Bunny and J Balvin, debuted at number eight on the Hot 100 following the album's release. It was distributed to urban contemporary and contemporary hit radio as the album's fourth single on May 25, 2018, and several days later, the song's music video premiered on Cardi B's YouTube channel. After being released as a single, it topped the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, making Cardi the first female rapper with multiple number one singles on the chart's history. The single has been certified nine-times platinum by the RIAA, becoming the second-highest-certified single by a female rapper, following "Bodak Yellow. "I Like It" and "Bodak Yellow" made Cardi B the only female rapper to have two videos on her YouTube channel with more than 1 billion views.
"Ring", featuring Kehlani, impacted US urban contemporary radio on August 28, 2018, as the fifth single. Previously, it had entered at number 28 on the Hot 100 as an album track following the album's release. The single has been certified double platinum by the RIAA.
Critical reception.
"Invasion of Privacy" received widespread acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 84, based on 24 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". Ben Beaumont-Thomas of "The Guardian" gave "Invasion of Privacy" four out of five stars, and called it "a magnificent debut that fuses vulnerability, sexual voraciousness, paranoia, and party music" and wrote that the album "shows the rapper is capable of far more than punchy put-downs". For "Exclaim!", Erin Lowers scored the album a 9 out of 10, noting that her softer singles add "a new dimension" to her artistry, and adding that the release "feels like her 'Lemonade' moment, one that magnifies her insecurities for public consumption."
Maeve McDermott of "USA Today" gave the album another positive review, stating that "at 13 tracks, "Invasion of Privacy" isn't overstuffed with endless filler tracks like many releases by Cardi's rap peers. Leave it to Cardi, marketing queen, to know that fans get exhausted when performers overstay their welcome in attempts to rack up streaming numbers. The hip hop star likely doesn't have to worry about that, considering her album seems destined for charts success, if "Bodak Yellow"'s record-breaking last year was any indication." Jem Aswad of "Variety" called it "one of the most powerful debuts of this millennium" and praised its opening number "Get Up 10" as an "empowering opening autobiographical testimonial," though he also felt "in a couple of cases the featured artists run off with the song so completely that it feels like Cardi is a guest on her own album." Eleanor Halls of "GQ" wrote: ""Invasion of Privacy" proves "Bodak Yellow" was far from a summer one-hit wonder. These money moves are played for the long game."
Rob Sheffield of "Rolling Stone" described the album as "lavishly emotional, intimately personal, wildly funny," and concluded ""Invasion" proves she's here to stay." For "Pitchfork", Sheldon Pearce awarded the album "Best New Music", writing that "Cardi B's remarkable debut places her, without a doubt, in the pantheon of great rappers. It is both brazen and vulnerable, filled with wild amounts of personality, style, and craft". Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" noted, "she is more versatile than most rappers or pop stars of any stripe," adding, "[it] is also, notably, a hip-hop album that doesn't sound like any of its temporal peers."
Chris Richards of "The Washington Post" commented: "She seems to be telling one long story here — about self-empowerment, beating the odds, transcendence — but the force of Cardi's narrative resides in the sound of her voice as much as it does in her words. You can hear it during the album's grand finale, "I Do," when she asks, "My little 15 minutes lasted long as hell, huh?" What a victory speech. Close your eyes and you might feel the confetti falling on your shoulders, too." Carrie Battan of "The New Yorker" complimented "Invasion of Privacy" by saying "[it] is as studious as it is bombastic."
"Time" magazine named "Invasion of Privacy" the best album of 2018, stating, "Cardi's debut doesn't just earn her a seat at hip-hop's table—it marks her as a singular voice."
Accolades.
A number of music publications included "Invasion of Privacy" among their top 10 albums of the year lists, with "Rolling Stone" and "Time" listing it at number one. In 2019, "Rolling Stone" and "Pitchfork" listed the album as one of the greatest albums of the decade, placing it at number 34 and 73, respectively.

Commercial performance.
"Invasion of Privacy" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on the day of its release due to a technicality that incorporates the track-equivalent units moved by its previously released singles "Bodak Yellow" and "Bartier Cardi". It was certified double platinum on October 3, 2018, and triple platinum on April 3, 2019, following its physical release on CD. All thirteen tracks have been certified gold or higher by the RIAA, making her the first female artist to achieve such feat, and third overall.
On April 13, 2018, Apple Music announced that "Invasion of Privacy" set a new record for the most streamed album by a female artist in a single week with over a hundred million streams. The album debuted at number one on the US "Billboard" 200 chart, moving 255,000 album-equivalent units with 103,000 coming from pure album sales in its first week. It achieved the largest on-demand audio streaming week ever for an album by a woman with 202.6 million streams. At the time of its release, it became the second biggest first-week sales of 2018. Cardi B became the fifth female rapper to top the chart. On the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart dated April 21, Cardi B listed 13 songs, with 12 of them being songs from "Invasion of Privacy", thus surpassing Beyoncé for the most simultaneous songs on the chart by a solo female artist. The record was later broken by Billie Eilish in 2019 when 12 tracks from her album "When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?" and two additional singles charted on the Hot 100 in a single week. In its second week, the album fell to number two on the chart, earning an additional 129,000 units, dropping forty-nine percent from the first week. In its third week, the album remained at number two with over 91,000 units, dropping thirty percent from the previous week. It has spent twenty one consecutive weeks within the top ten on the chart, which is the most weeks for a female rap album— including eight non-consecutive weeks within the top five. It also spent twenty two consecutive weeks within the top ten on the Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop chart. As of July 6, 2018, "Invasion of Privacy" is the best-performing female album of 2018 and the third overall in the United States. The album remained the largest female debut of 2018 in the country until September 2018, with the release of Carrie Underwood's "Cry Pretty". In the US, "Invasion of Privacy" was the fourth best selling album of 2018 with 2,060,000 album-equivalent units, the best selling for a female artist that year.
In December 2019, it became the most-streamed album by a female rapper ever in Spotify. In January 2020, it became the longest-charting debut album by a female rapper on the "Billboard" 200, surpassing Lauryn Hill's "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" (1998). In August 2020, it became the longest-charting album by a female rapper, surpassing 124 weeks. It surpassed 150 weeks in the chart in February 2021.
"Invasion of Privacy" also debuted atop the Canadian Albums Chart, moving 12,000 album-equivalent units. It was certified Platinum by Music Canada for shipments of 80,000 copies. The album was a commercial success internationally as well, peaking within the top ten on charts in Australia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Flanders, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
It was the third most streamed album of 2018 in Apple Music globally, being the highest for a female artist. It was the tenth most streamed album in Canada on the streaming service. It was also the fifth most streamed album in that platform ever, being the highest for a female artist. In Spotify, it was the fourth most streamed album of the year in the United States, also being the highest for a female artist, with Cardi being the most streamed female artist. In 2020, Spotify's RapCaviar announced Cardi B and Drake as the top performers on the playlist since its creation.
Legacy.
"Spin" staff credited the album for opening "the table to a new generation of pop artists remaking American music in their own image and accents. And Cardi will remain front-and-center." The magazine further added that "Invasion of Privacy" is an "invitation into [her] world of blood, sweat, and tears... it's a rebuke to much of what passes for chart-focused rap, where the artist's persona is crafted for maximum exposure. Instead, Cardi B recognized that POC artists no longer need to pander or soften themselves in order to become household names." In 2019, "Consequence of Sound" editors wrote "her authenticity and charisma are constants that reinforce her standing as one of the most formidable hip-hop artists of the decade," and "NME" stated that the album secured "her crown as the new Queen of Rap." In a book excerpt published in "Jezebel" of "The Motherlode" (2021) by Clover Hope, the author wrote that "Invasion of Privacy" was "the best rap debut in years and belongs in the canon along with Lil' Kim's "Hard Core" and Lauryn Hill's "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill"," and stated that the album "jump-started a new era for women rappers in which success felt much more tangible" as Cardi B "multiplied the wealth of talent and resurrected the idea that numerous women who controlled their own stories could dominate rap at once... Never again would there only be one."

List of ancient Daco-Thracian peoples and tribes

This is a list of four ancient peoples and their tribes that were possibly related and formed an extinct Indo-European branch of peoples and languages in the eastern Balcans, low Danube basin. These peoples dwelt from west of the Tyras (Dniester) river and east of the Carpathian Mountains in the north, to the north coast of the Aegean Sea in the south, from the west coast of the Pontus Euxinus (Black Sea) in the east, to roughly the Angrus (modern South Morava) river basin, Tisia (modern Tisza) and Danubius (modern Danube) rivers in the west. This list is based in the possible ethnolinguist affiliation of these peoples - Geto-Dacians, Moesians, Thracians and Paeonians (including possibly or partly Thracian or Dacian tribes) and not only on a geographical base (that includes other peoples that were not Dacians or Thracians like the Celts that lived in Dacia or in Thrace).
Thracians.
Certain tribes and subdivisions of tribes were named differently by ancient writers but modern research points out that these were in fact the same tribe. The name "Thracians" itself seems to be a Greek exonym and we have no way of knowing what the Thracians called themselves. Also certain tribes mentioned by Homer are not indeed historical.
Thracians mixed with other peoples.
Thraco-Illyrians.
Mixed tribes of Thracians and Illyrians, Thracians and Illyrians seem to have belonged to two ethnolinguistic different branches of Indo-European peoples.
Thraco-Phrygians.
Mixed tribes of Thracians and Phrygians, however Phrygians seem to have been a people ethnolinguistically closer to the Hellenic peoples, Greeks and ancient Macedonians, and not to the Thracians.
Possible Daco-Thracian peoples.
Paeonians / Paeones.
There are different views and still no agreement among scholars about the Paeonians' ethnic and linguistic kinship. Some such as Wilhelm Tomaschek and Paul Kretschmer claim that the language spoken by the Paeonians belonged to the Illyrian family, while Dimitar Dechev claims affinities with Thracian. Irwin L. Merker considers that the language spoken by the Paeonians was closely related to Greek (and ancient Macedonian if it was a distinct language from ancient Greek), a Hellenic language with "a great deal of Illyrian and Thracian influence as a result of this proximity".

Biafran Armed Forces

The Biafran Armed Forces (BAF) were the military of the secessionist state of Biafra which existed from 1967 until 1970.
History.
At the beginning of the Nigerian Civil War, Biafra had 3,000 soldiers. This number grew as the war progressed, ultimately reaching 30,000. No official support for the Biafran Army came from any other nation, although arms were clandestinely acquired. Because of this, the Biafrans manufactured many of their weapons locally. 
Some Europeans served the Biafran cause: German-born Rolf Steiner was a lieutenant colonel assigned to the 4th Commando Brigade, and Welshman Taffy Williams served as a major throughout the conflict. A special guerrilla unit, the Biafran Organization of Freedom Fighters, was established: designed to emulate the Viet Cong, they targeted Nigerian supply lines, forcing them to shift resources to internal security efforts.
Legacy.
In course of the insurgency in Southeastern Nigeria of 2021, a separatist group known as "Biafran National Guard" (BNG) organized the "Biafran Supreme Military Council of Administration". The latter posed as high command of the restored Biafran Armed Forces, including the "Biafran Army, Biafran Navy, Biafran Air-Force and Biafran Detective Force".
Branches.
Army.
At the peak of Biafran military power, the Biafran Army was made of 5 divisions; numbered 11th, 12th, 13th (later renumbered 15th), 14th and 101st. It also had 2 separate brigades, the S Brigade, a Pretorian guard for General Ojukwu, and the 4th Commando Brigade (trained and commanded by mercenaries). It was commanded by Brigadier Hillary Njoku and later Major General Alexander Madiebo.
Air wing.
The Biafrans set up a small, yet effective air force. Biafran Air Force commanders were Chude Sokey and later Godwin Ezeilo, who had trained with the Royal Canadian Air Force. Its early inventory included two B-25 Mitchells, two B-26 Invaders, (one piloted by Polish World War II ace Jan Zumbach, known also as John Brown), a converted DC-3 and one Dove. In 1968, Swedish pilot Carl Gustaf von Rosen suggested the MiniCOIN project to General Ojukwu. 
By early 1969, Biafra had assembled five MFI-9Bs in Gabon, calling them "Biafra Babies". They were coloured green, were able to carry six 68 mm anti-armour rockets under each wing using simple sights. The five planes were flown by three Swedish pilots and three Biafran pilots. In September 1969, Biafra acquired four ex-Armee de l'Air North American T-6Gs, which were flown to Biafra the following month, with another T-6 lost on the ferry flight. These aircraft flew missions until January 1970 manned by Portuguese ex-military pilots.
During the war, Biafra tried to acquire jets. Two Fouga Magisters and several Gloster Meteors were bought but never arrived in Biafra, being abandoned on foreign African airbases.
Navy.
Biafra had a small improvised navy, but it never gained the success of the air force. It was headquartered in Kidney Island, Port Harcourt, and was commanded by Winifred Anuku. The Biafran Navy was made up of captured craft, converted tugs, and armored civilian vessels armed with machine guns, or captured 6-pounder guns. It mainly operated in the Niger Delta and along the Niger River.

Diuris monticola

Diuris monticola, commonly known as highland golden moths, is a species of orchid that is endemic to south-eastern Australia. It is a common and widespread, late flowering species growing in grassland and woodland habitats at higher altitudes. It has a tuft of up to nine leaves at the base and up to four slightly drooping bright yellow flowers with dark streaks in the centre.
Description.
"Diuris monticola" is a tuberous, perennial herb with between five and nine narrow linear leaves long and wide in a loose tuft. Up to four slightly drooping bright yellow flowers with dark streaks in the centre and wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal leans forward and is egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, the narrower end towards the base, long, wide, lean downwards and parallel to each other. The petals are egg-shaped, long, wide and spread apart from each other on a blackish stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are linear to narrowly wedge-shaped, long and wide with irregular edges.

Kirk King

Kirk King (born December 24, 1975) is a retired professional basketball player. He played for the Connecticut Huskies from 1993 to 1997 before being suspended during his senior season for violating National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules. In 1997, he was drafted into the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), the now-defunct developmental league of the National Basketball Association (NBA). While never reaching the NBA, King played professionally for several years in the CBA, the United States Basketball League, the International Basketball League, the Philippines, Greece, Puerto Rico and Venezuela.
Early life and amateur career.
Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, King attended Southern Lab High School. He led the school's basketball team to two state championships during his junior and senior seasons. He played for the People to People Student Ambassador Program basketball team which traveled to the Dominican Republic in 1994, Italy in 1995 and Spain in 1996. 
King opted to attend the University of Connecticut instead of a Louisiana university following a visit to Connecticut and a tour of the campus. After averaging 2.9 points per game in his first two seasons as a reserve player with the Connecticut Huskies, King was given the starting small forward spot going into his junior season (1995–96). 
On January 10, 1996, King set a career high in points with 20 on 10-of-10 shooting from the field, tying a Big East Conference record for number of field goals made in a game without a miss. In January 1996, King made 22 straight field goals, three shy on the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) record of 25-for-25.
Going into the 1996–97 season, King was the only player on UConn's roster that had experience as a starter and was named the team's captain. In January 1997, the NCAA announced that King and UConn sophomore Ricky Moore had been suspended for accepting free airline tickets from agent John Lounsbury to fly back to Connecticut in October 1995. King's suspension was for the remainder of his senior season. The NCAA gave King a longer suspension than Moore because according to their investigation King knew he was violating NCAA rules. UConn was later stripped of their wins during their 1996 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament run and ordered them to pay back $90,970 in money the school made during the postseason. The team made King an undergraduate assistant coach following his suspension, allowing him to attend practices, travel with the team and sit on their bench during games. 
Huskies head coach Jim Calhoun told the "Hartford Courant", "Kirk King made a mistake; nothing more, nothing less. I think he should be able to play, but I don't run the NCAA. What Kirk said to us was more than compelling to me. Apparently, it wasn't for other people. I can't control that." King graduated from Connecticut with a bachelor's degree in sociology.
Professional career.
Following his graduation in 1997, King was drafted in the fifth round (46 overall) by the Connecticut Pride in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA). During his rookie season in the CBA, King averaged 10.9 points per game and 4.5 rebounds. He was named the CBA's American Conference Player of the Week on January 3, 1998. King had brief stints playing for the Connecticut Skyhawks in the United States Basketball League (USBL) in 1997 and 1998. King played for the Guaiqueríes de Margarita of the Liga Profesional de Baloncesto in Venezuela in 1998. During the off-season before the 1998–99 season, King worked out with the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA), but was cut from the team before the preseason. 
King signed with the La Crosse Bobcats of the CBA in 1998, but was later traded to the Rockford Lightning. In 1999, King played briefly with a professional team based in Aibonito, Puerto Rico. Going into the 1999–2000 season, King signed with the Trenton Shooting Stars of the International Basketball League (IBL). King signed with the San Diego Stingrays of the IBL in January 2000.
In the summer of 2000, King played professional basketball in the Philippines. King re-joined the Connecticut Pride in the CBA before the league ceased operations and filed for bankruptcy in February 2001. He was named to the CBA All-Star game during the 2000–01 season. He also played with the Baltimore Bayrunners in the IBL during the 2000–01 season. Following the IBL season, King signed with the Toros de Aragua of the Liga Profesional de Baloncesto in Venezuela. Later that year, King joined the Piratas de Quebradillas in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional, Puerto Rico's top-tier men's professional basketball league. 
In 2001, King signed with A.O. Near East B.C. in the Greek Basket League in Greece. During the 2001–02 season, King averaged 14.2 points per game and 10 rebounds in 26 games played. He led the Greek Basket League in total rebounds (259). King last played for Gaiteros del Zulia in the Venezuelan Liga Profesional de Baloncesto in 2005 before a knee injury forced him to retire.

Bruno von Porstendorf

Bruno von Porstendorf otherwise Bruno II of Meissen or Bruno II von Porstendorf (died 4 December 1228) was Bishop of Meissen from 1209 to 1228.
In older lists of the bishops of Meissen he is numbered as Bruno III because of the inclusion of an earlier Bruno II, who was a clerical error.
Life.
Along with the Přemyslid Kings of Bohemia Bruno was one of the most active participants in the German settlement of Upper Lusatia. For one thing, this was the location of the majority of the estates of the bishops of Meissen; for another, Bruno was keen in this way to secure his power in Upper Lusatia against the inroads of the Bohemians.
In 1228 he was removed from his office by Pope Gregory IX, presumably because of his reckless behaviour, and died on 4 December in the same year. His body was buried in the crypt of the collegiate church in Bautzen, which he had founded himself between 1213 and 1218.
In 1225 Bruno dedicated the Chapel of St. George in the Matthias Gate in Ortenburg, Bautzen.

Goeppertia rufibarba (syn. "Calathea rufibarba"), the furry feather or velvet calathea, is a flowering plant in the Marantaceae family, native to Bahia state of northeastern Brazil. The plant's common names are due to its fuzzy, fur-like underleaf texture, which is unusual in its genus. Common as a houseplant, the species requires warm temperatures, shade, and humidity to thrive, and may produce small yellow flowers. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

2019 West Coast Conference Men's Basketball Tournament

The 2019 West Coast Conference Men's Basketball Tournament was the postseason men's basketball tournament for the West Coast Conference during the 2018–19 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, held March 7–12 at the Orleans Arena in Paradise, Nevada. Saint Mary's upset top-ranked Gonzaga 60–47 in the championship game and received the conference's automatic bid to the 68-team NCAA Tournament.
It was the fourth WCC Tournament title for Saint Mary's, their first since 2012, and the Gaels were seeded eleventh in the South regional of the NCAA Tournament. With the loss, Gonzaga fell to fourth in the national rankings, but was still the top seed in the West regional.
Seeds.
All ten WCC schools teams participated in the tournament, seeded by conference record, with a tiebreaker system for identical conference records. The tournament returned to a format similar to that used from 2003 to 2011, with slight changes to the terminology used for the rounds prior to the semifinals. The 7 through 10 seeds will play in the "first round", the 5 and 6 seeds will start play in the "second round", and the 3 and 4 seeds will start in the "third round". The top two seeds will receive byes into the semifinals. 
As the regular-season champion, Gonzaga clinched a semifinal spot, and technically secured a place in the NIT. However, the Bulldogs were all but certain to receive an NCAA Tournament bid regardless of results in the conference tournament, given that they entered the final week of the conference season as the top-ranked team in the AP Poll.
Saint Mary's also clinched a semifinal berth as the regular season runner-up. BYU and San Francisco clinched double byes, while LMU and Santa Clara had single byes. San Diego, Pepperdine, Pacific and Portland played in the first round.

<doc id="56952480" url="?curid=56952480" title="Jennie Lee (song)">
Jennie Lee (song)

"Jennie Lee" is a song whose music was composed and written by Jan Berry and Arnie Ginsburg, which was recorded by Jan and Arnie. Jan &amp; Arnie were the precursor to Jan &amp; Dean. The song was recorded and released as the band's first single in April, 1958. The B-side of the single is "Gotta Getta Date. "Jennie Lee" reached No. 3 on the Cash Box charts on June 21, 1958, and No. 8 on the Billboard charts on June 30, 1958. This is generally regarded as the earliest example of elements that would become instrumental in the famous California sound of surf pop in the 60's.
Composition.
After being inspired by a poster featuring a local Hollywood burlesque performer, Virginia Lee Hicks, who was then performing as Jennie Lee, the "Bazoom Girl", at the New Follies Burlesk at 548 S. Main Street, Los Angeles, Ginsburg wrote a tribute song, "Jennie Lee", that he brought to Berry and Torrence. Arnold P. Ginsburg, from Wisconsin, grew up in West Los Angeles, and was a school friend of Jan Berry. He is sometimes confused with the Boston radio DJ Arnie "Woo Woo" Ginsburg, but is unrelated.
Berry adapted the Civil War tune "Aura Lea" and arranged the harmonies. After weeks of practice, Berry, Ginsburg, and Torrence planned to record a demo recording in Berry's garage, but Torrence was conscripted into the United States Army Reserve, forcing Berry and Ginsburg to record "Jennie Lee" without Torrence, with Berry's friend and fellow University High student Donald J. Altfeld (born March 18, 1940, in Los Angeles, California) "belting out the rhythm on a children's metal high chair". The next day Berry took their recording to Radio Recorders, a small recording studio, to have it transferred to an acetate disc. Joe Lubin, Vice President and Head of A &amp; R of Doris Day and Martin Melcher's Arwin Records, was impressed and offered to add instruments and to release it through Arwin. In March 1958 the fathers of Berry and Ginsburg signed contracts authorizing Lubin to produce, arrange, and manage their sons.
Berry and Ginsburg, now christened "Jan &amp; Arnie", re-recorded their vocals on a professional recording system. Produced by Lubin, "Jennie Lee" (Arwin 108), backed with "Gotta Get a Date" (credited to Ginsburg, Berry &amp; Lubin), became a surprise commercial success. According to Berry's biographer Mark A. Moore, "The song (with backing vocals, plus additional instruments added by the Ernie Freeman combo) had a raucous R&amp;B flavor, with a bouncing bomp-bomp vocal hook that would become a signature from Jan on future recordings." Distributed by Dot Records, "Jennie Lee" was released in mid-April, entered the charts on May 10, 1958, the same day they appeared on ABC's "Dick Clark Show". "Jennie Lee" peaked at No. 3 on the Cash Box charts on June 21, 1958, No. 4 on the R&amp;B charts, and No. 8 on the Billboard charts on June 30, 1958. Billy Ward and his Dominoes's R&amp;B cover of "Jennie Lee" reached No. 55 in the Pop charts in June 1958, while other cover versions including that of Moon Mullican (Coral 9-61994) and Bobby Phillips &amp; the Toppers (Tops 45-R422-49), released in 1958 failed to chart.
Covers.
Shortly after Jan and Arnie's version was released, Billy Ward and his Dominoes came out with a cover that charted at number 55 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and placed at 14 on the US R&amp;B charts.
In 1962 Jan &amp; Dean recorded a version of the song on their album "Jan &amp; Dean Golden Hits".

Uganda National Records Centre and Archives

The Uganda National Records Center and Archives (UNRCA), is a government building that houses the headquarters of the Uganda National Archives and Records Centre. Prior to the completion of this building, the national records were kept at the present day National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) Secretariat, in the basement of a former colonial administration building in Entebbe.
Location.
The building is located at Plot 8-9 Lourdel Road in the Wandegeya neighborhood, in the Central Division of Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city, about north of the city's business district. The coordinates of the building are: 00°19'56.0"N, 32°34'42.0"E (Latitude:0.332222; Longitude:32.578333).
Overview.
The National Archives Center is administered by the Uganda Ministry of Public Service.
Prospective researchers who intend to use the archives, require clearance from the "National Council for Science and Technology". The clearance certificate costs US$300 for non-Ugandans and US$50 for Ugandan academics including postgraduate students pursuing Masters and Doctoral degrees. Undergraduates attending Ugandan universities are not charged a fee, but they require written clearance from their respective universities and from the National Council for Science and Technology.
Construction.
Construction of the building is progressing in phases. The construction of the first phase started in 2013 and was completed in 2015 at a cost of USh20.8 billion (US$5.8 million), using a USh20.3 billion (US$5.7 million) loan from the International Development Association (IDA) through the World Bank. The second phase is expected to cost USh28.6 billion (US$7.9 million). About USh5 billion (US$1.2 million) is needed to enable the center operate fully. The building is being developed in phases, due to insufficient funds. China Railway Jianchang Engineering Company was the main contractor for phase I, while Mutiso Menezes International were the supervising consultants.

SS Senator

SS "Senator" was a steel-hulled Great Lakes freighter that sank on Lake Michigan with the loss of nine lives and 268 Nash automobiles, on Halloween of 1929 after she was rammed in heavy fog by the bulk carrier "Marquette". She lies in of water 16 miles northeast of Port Washington, Wisconsin. On April 12, 2016 her wreck was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
"Senator" (Official number 116725) was built in 1896 by the Detroit Dry Dock Company of Wyandotte, Michigan. Her hull had an overall length of , and she was between her perpendiculars, her beam was wide and her cargo hold was deep. She had a gross register tonnage of 4048.75 tons and a net tonnage of 3178.66 tons. She was powered by a triple expansion steam engine which was fueled by two coal-burning Scotch marine boilers.
"Senator" was launched on June 20, 1896 as hull number #122. She entered service on July 25, 1896. "Senator" was used to carry bulk cargoes such as iron ore, coal and later automobiles. She was also built using two unique early Great Lakes bulk carrier building techniques which were steel arches and a moveable water ballast system. She was originally owned by the Wolverine Steamship Company of Detroit, Michigan.
At the time of "Senator" launching, the newspaper "Marine Review" wrote two articles speaking of the steamer's characteristics. The first article published on June 11, 1896 reads:
Matters in the ship yard of the Detroit Dry Dock Co. at Wyandotte are being arranged for the launching of the big steel steamer "Senator" on Saturday, the 13th. The "Senator" is one of the steamers of the 400-foot type and will be owned by the Wolverine Steamship Co., of which John B. Roby is president and in which Senator McMillan and other stockholders of the dry dock company are interested. The steamer will be managed by Capt. M.W. Humphries. She is 420 feet long over all, 400 feet keel, 45 feet beam and 28 feet deep, and will be propelled by a triple expansion engine with cylinders 22, 35 and 60 inches in diameter by 44 inches stroke. It is expected that on 16 feet draft she will carry about 4,800 gross tons of ore and that with this load her engines, which are of 1,400 horse power, will drive her at the rate of 13 miles an hour. A feature in this boat is a patent anchor in the extreme stern. This is to be used in case of emergency in the "Soo" river and other narrow channels when through current or the influence of a passing vessel control of the big steamer is lost and she begins to swing so as to bring her into dangerous proximity to another boat or to a rock or dock. She will carry one smokestack, two short spars forward of this, will be fitted with Howden hot draft, and will have a complete electric lighting plant, search light, full handling equipment, telephones to connect the master or pilot with distant parts of the ship, etc. Alike to other big coarse freight carriers of her kind, she will have no deck house or in fact anything between the boiler house and texas excepting the deck engines. The "Senator" will be sailed by Capt. H.B. McQueen, who has been in the "Marina", "S.S. Curry", "Geo. F. McWilliams", "John F. Eddy" and other steamers. 
The second article which was published on June 25, 1896 reads:
The big freight steamer "Senator", which was launched Saturday at the Wyandotte yard of the Detroit Dry Dock Co., was quite fully described in our issue of June 11 on page 11. She is 420 feet long over all, 400 feet keel 45 feet beam and 28 feet deep, with twelve hatches and a water bottom 5 ½ feet deep. Two of the hatches are forward of the pilot house, but the after house is placed far in the stern, giving a clear deck as in other steamers of her kind. Cylinders of engines are 22, 36 and 58 inches diameter by 44 inches stroke, and there are two boilers, each 13 feet 6 inches by 12 feet, allowed 165 pounds working pressure. The two Rockefeller steamers building at Wyandotte will be in nearly all respects similar to this boat. The "Senator" is owned by the Wolverine Steamship Co. of Detroit, composed of John B. Roby, president and general manager; James McMillan, C.L. Freer, F.J. Hecker, M.W. Humphrey, the estate of the late Capt. Peck, A. McVittie and others. She will be sailed by Capt. E.B. McQueen with Andrew Carter as chief engineer.
In 1898 "Senator" loaded 224,000 bushels of corn at Milwaukee, Wisconsin which was one of the largest cargoes loaded at that port, at that time.
In June 1898 "Senator" got stuck on Ballard's Reef near Detroit.
On August 21, 1909 "Senator" suffered what was possibly the most significant incident in her career prior to her sinking, and that was when the steamer struck and sank her off Pipe Island in the St Marys River. "Norman B. Ream" tore a large hole in her starboard side, her crew had hardly any time to run her on the middle ground before her hull filled with water. On September 12, 1909 "Senator" was raised and taken to a dock. On October 6, 1909 "Senator" was towed into the port of Cleveland, Ohio. On the following day she was placed in Dry Dock No.2 for repairs which cost $90,000. She was out of commission for the rest of the shipping season.
Final voyage and sinking.
On October 31. 1929 "Senator", under the command of Captain George Kinch was transporting a cargo of 268 Nash automobiles (worth $251,000) from Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Detroit, Michigan. Meanwhile, the ore carrier "Marquette", under the command of Captain W.F. Amesbury was bound from Escanaba, Michigan for the steel mills of Indiana with a load of iron ore. The two ships collided, with "Senator" sinking in 8 minutes. Several of the crew jumped into the water while others made it onto the "Marquette". A tugboat rescued 15 men from the lake. Of the crew of 28, seven died.
Discovery of the wreck.
The exact location of the Senator was discovered on June 10, 2005 using a Klein 531 side scan sonar. The depth at the wreck site is .

Victorian School of Forestry

The Victorian School of Forestry (VSF) was established in October 1910 at Creswick, in the Australian state of Victoria. It was located at the former Creswick Hospital, built in 1863 during the gold rush. The creation of VSF was one of the many recommendations of a Royal Commission held between 1897 and 1901 into forest degradation. The first tertiary forestry school in Australia, VSF was administered by the Forests Commission Victoria (FCV) until 1980, when VSF amalgamated with the University of Melbourne to become that institution's School of Ecosystem and Forest Sciences. From 1910 to 1980, 522 students completed the Diploma of Forestry at VSF.
History.
The supply of professional staff was a paramount concern to Conservators of the early State Forests Department in Victoria.
Forestry training really began with the idea expressed by Conservator Frederick D'A. Vincent from the Imperial Forest Service in India after his inspection of Victorian forestry in 1887. It was then reiterated by George Samuel Perrin, the first Conservator of Forests, in 1890, that a training school was necessary because overseas forestry staff, if available, could not "adapt themselves to the new and strange conditions of forestry in this country". His suggestion was supported by numerous reports and inquiries.
The new Forest Act (1907) also recognised that effective management of forests required appropriately skilled staff, stipulating that no person could be appointed to a forestry position without completing a relevant course and passing a special examination, thus paving the way for the establishment of the forestry school at Creswick.
The Victorian School of Forestry (VSF), also known locally as "The School on the Hill", was located at the former Creswick hospital which was built in 1863. The buildings and grounds were purchased for £1,163 7s 3d in 1909 by the Victorian Government and refurbished at the instigation of John Johnstone, (Superintendent of State Plantations), the direction of Donald McLeod, (Minister of Forests, 1904-1909) together with Sir Peter McBride (Minister of Forests, 1909-1913) and the support of Sir Alexander Peacock, who was then the parliamentary representative for the seat of Creswick and later Premier of Victoria.  The school's main gates were dedicated to Sir Alexander in 1952.
The State Government opened the school on 29 October 1910, attended by a large delegation of dignitaries, Members of the Victorian Parliament, and their companions. The visitors toured the School, nursery, plantation and proposed Arboretum, and toasted the great endeavour.
The Victorian School of Forestry was the first institution of its kind in Australia.
VSF was a residential school having the old hospital wards available as classrooms, well equipped kitchen and nurses quarters and other rooms suitable for staff and student accommodation. Originally called "Pednolva" school classes began in the house built in 1881 for Dr John Tremearne, who had been the resident medical officer at the Creswick Hospital from 1872 to 1888, but later moved up the hill to the old hospital building. The forests surrounding Creswick had been thoroughly cut over during the gold mining era from the 1850s until around 1900. The forester John La Gerche was placed in charge of the forest land around Creswick in the late 1880s. He established a State nursery at nearby Sawpit Gully in 1888 to aid the revegetation of the forests around Creswick. Land rehabilitation and the need to create softwood resources meant that some of the first plantations of radiata pine were established around 1900 and became part of the school demonstration forest. In the early years, practical training was completed under the direction of John Johnstone, Superintendent of State Plantations. Johnstone was born in Scotland in 1858 and served his gardening and forestry apprenticeship at Gordon Castle, and after getting married decided to emigrate to Victoria. He worked to establish Maddingley Park at Bacchus Marsh before being recruited to the Forests Department in 1898 by George Samuel Perrin.
The School lacked trained foresters to teach specialised coursework, so teachers were recruited from the nearby Ballarat School of Mines who focussed solely on basic sciences. Mr Thomas Stephan Hart, formerly Professor of Geology and Mining, was appointed Senior Master in May 1913. The academic standard of the course was ensured by a Board of Examiners headed by the Professor of Botany at Melbourne University, Professor Alfred James Ewart (1872–1937).
The initial class of six students that commenced in October 1910 were already in training as foresters under a system of supervised practical work or were appointed from work crews. Entrance to the school was by competitive examination for boys between fourteen and sixteen years of "sound health and good moral character." The school was later officially opened at a ceremony on 26 May 1913 by Hugh Mackay, Conservator of Forests.
Regulations were gazetted in September 1914 to enable trainees at the school to be paid £48 in their first year, £52 in the second year and £56 in the third, with £45 being deducted to cover board, lodging and tuition. Upon graduation, students were appointed as cadet foresters to the Forests Commission Victoria.
In 1914, the British Association met in Australia and among the many distinguished visitors was Sir David Ernest Hutchins, a graduate of the "École nationale des eaux et forêts" at Nancy in France. Hutchins was then retired, but with considerable experience across the British Empire in both India and South Africa. Australia's first Inspector-General of Forests Charles Edward Lane Poole also an alma mater of the French forestry school, invited Hutchins to tour all Australian States and New Zealand. Hutchins reported in 1916 on the overall parlous state of forest management but wrote enthusiastically about both Victoria and the progress being made at the Forestry School.
Nine VSF students are known to have enlisted in the Great War and one of the first graduates of the school, Reginald Graham Lindsay, (brother of famous Australian artist and writer, Norman Lindsay), joined 22nd Australian Field Artillery Brigade but was killed in action in France on 31 December 1916. Reg was queuing with four other soldiers for rations when they were all killed by a direct shell landing in their midst, although it is often more colourfully reported that he was shot "when dashing out of his dugout to rescue a bottle of rum" on New Year's Eve.
A number of VSF graduates volunteered for military service in WW2 with some joining units deployed to the UK and other places as forestry companies in the Royal Australian Engineers (RAE) and served with distinction to produce timber for the war efforts. After the war, the first intake of ex-servicemen into the forestry school occurred. Twenty applications were received with four being selected. A further six were later enrolled in 1946–47.
VSF students were also subject to compulsory national service training in the 1950s. The forestry profession was not exempt and four students were conscripted to serve in Vietnam in the 1960s.
Relationship with other Australian tertiary institutions.
The twentieth century had started optimistically with the Federation of Australia, but co-operation between the states was hesitant. The leaders of the small state forest agencies met in 1911 and recommended that Australia needed to conserve sufficient forests and start plantations. Although they had already established forestry organisations as best they could, they needed better ways of recruiting and training foresters. Within a few months of each other, Victoria and South Australia started forestry schools but took paths that reflected their roots. Western Australia and NSW also started forestry schools at Ludlow and Narara in the 1920s but these schools only lasted for a few years.
An Australian Forestry School (AFS) was first mooted in 1916 and later established, initially in Adelaide in 1926, before moving to the Canberra suburb of Yarralumla in 1927 under the Commonwealth Department of National Development. Students undertaking the first two years of an appropriately designed science course at their (then sole) State University and then proceeding to Canberra to undertake a Diploma course over two years. The home university granted a Bachelor of Science in Forestry degree. Sixteen students representing all states, including Alf Lawrence from Victoria, were enrolled in 1926. Lecturing staff included Norman William Jolly, Charles Earnest Carter (ex Principal of VSF), Hugh Richard Gray and A. Rule while Charles Edward Lane Poole acted as Principal. The prestigious Schlich Medal was awarded annually to the outstanding forestry student at the Australian Forestry School from 1928. However, Victoria withdrew from the arrangement in 1930 and instead continued to support the VSF at Creswick, thereby starting a rift within the recently formed Institute of Foresters of Australia (IFA) that took many years to heal.
While other states cautiously relinquished their fledgling forestry schools, Victoria continued with supporting the VSF Diploma course after the Commonwealth started its national Australian Forestry School in 1926, partly due to an acrimonious dispute with the Commonwealth Inspector-General of Forestry and Principal of the School, Charles Edward Lane Poole, over the standard of the Victorian foresters. The Institute of Foresters of Australia, founded in 1935, was also racked over its refusal to grant full membership to foresters holding the Victorian Diploma.
However, the first twenty years of the Australian Forestry School proved difficult. The Great Depression, the Second World War, the states’ suspicions of the Commonwealth, and the abrasive manner of the school's head, Charles Lane Poole, all acted to reduce the number of students being sent there; one year there were none and several times during the war years it was nearly closed. Upon Lane Poole's retirement in January 1945 Dr Maxwell Ralph Jacobs was appointed Principal, a position he held until 1959. The post war intake of students increased to between 15 and 30 with many from New Zealand until a school was opened at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch. By 1965 the responsibilities of the Australian Forestry School were transferred to the Australian National University in Canberra and it developed a four-year Bachelor of Science in Forestry degree and postgraduate research degrees.
From the mid-1940s, under the stewardship of the Chairman of the Forests Commission, Alfred Vernon Galbraith, students from Creswick extended their studies at the University of Melbourne to gain a Bachelor of Forest Science after the University established its own Forestry School in 1938. The two institutions worked well together and eventually, the Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry, University of Melbourne was created in 1973. The arrangement whereby Creswick diplomates could complete a degree with two years additional study at the University continued. Some VSF graduates continued their studies towards a master's degree or PhD research. By the late 1950s, Commission staff began to produce a stream of peer-reviewed research into the silviculture of key eucalypt species, especially on germination, growth rates and other aspects of productivity. In the 1960s, academic research expanded into areas such as soils, entomology and pathogenic threats to forests, hydrology and as well as fire research. Later in the 1970s, wildlife research, landscape management, economics and recreation demand.
One of the unforeseen and long term consequences of the dispute with Charles Lane Pool in the 1930s, combined with the rebuff from the Institute of Foresters, was that VSF Diploma graduates tended to remain in Victoria throughout their careers while Canberra and Melbourne University graduates tended to occupy roles in other state forestry services. Not surprisingly, there were some lingering rivalries over the perceived class division and unfortunately this had the effect of limiting the interchange of foresters across the State border. However, this undercurrent diminished over time as more Creswick foresters completed tertiary studies at Melbourne University.
Until the 1980s a Forestry, Agriculture or an Earth Science qualification like geomorphology was the traditional tertiary pathway into a land management career. Over time, many VSF graduates left the Forests Commission and went on to establish notable careers in other fields with the National Park Service, Fisheries and Wildlife, Alpine Resorts, Country Fire Authority, Soil Conservation Authority, LandCare, Land Conservation Council, Melbourne Water, teaching at tertiary institutions, consultancy, environmental NGO's, research organisations like the CSIRO and Universities, local government, the private sector, interstate and overseas.
Diploma of Forestry - 1910 to 1980.
For seven decades from 1910 to 1980, small groups of young men, as few as 6 and up to 20, but usually 10-12, took three-year residential courses graduating with forestry diplomas. Over time the title of the qualifications conferred at Creswick evolved. Early students were granted a School Certificate, but later an Associate Diploma of the School of Forestry, Creswick (A Dip For Cres) was awarded. In 1969 regulations were introduced to rename the award the Diploma of Forestry, Creswick (Dip For Cres). Earlier Associate Diploma qualifications were also upgraded in this process. Around the same time as Victoria split from the Australian Forestry School in Canberra in the 1930s, the Board of Examiners created a more senior award called the Diploma of Forestry, Victoria (Dip For Vic) targeted mostly for Associate Diploma graduates who, after serving for three years in the Department, submitted an acceptable thesis on an approved forestry subject to the Board of Forestry Education. Also because of the Victorian Public Service Board (PSB) rules that prevailed at the time, many Associate Diploma holders employed by the Forests Commission held fears about jobs and promotions going to graduates with Degrees and their ability to work interstate. The Dip For Vic qualification was deemed by the Commission and PSB to be equivalent to a Degree for the purposes of promotion and 64 were granted between 1935 and 1983.
While the Forests Commission was responsible for the administration of the school and appointment of the Principal, a Board of Forestry Education was created in 1962 (replacing the earlier Board of Examiners) and was responsible for ensuring high academic standards. The new Board grew from 4 to 11 members and included distinguished academics from the University of Melbourne such as John Harding Chinner.Students generally entered the school on fully funded scholarships and were "bonded" to work for the Forests Commission for a period of three years upon completion of their Diplomas, in what often turned out to be “a-career-for-life”. VSF scholarships were keenly sought as they offered a tertiary education for students from modest backgrounds, like Alfred (Alf) Oscar Lawrence who graduated from Creswick in 1922, undertook forest assessment and mapping surveys in the red gum forests along the Murray River before studying at Oxford in 1934 on a Russell Grimwade prize. Upon his return, he was appointed Fire Protection Officer during a difficult period following the disastrous 1939 bushfires and set about developing a highly organised fire fighting force, including introducing modern equipment such as powered pumps, aircraft, and a statewide radio communications network. Alf Lawrence rose to become Chairman of the Forests Commission in 1956 and was later awarded an OBE for his outstanding services to forestry and scouting in 1969.
While there were many distinguished graduates of VSF, Alfred (Alf) John Leslie stands out as a true international forester. After graduation in 1941 and a short stint with the Forests Commission on the Toorongo Plateau near Noojee supervising the 1939 bushfire salvage, he served in the Royal Australian Navy as a submariner where he was seriously wounded. After recuperating from his injuries and returning to Taggerty, Mansfield and then Beech Forest he completed a forestry degree at the University of Melbourne in 1948. He left the Commission in 1951 to join Australian Paper Manufacturers (APM) in the Latrobe Valley to establish their new pulpwood plantations. Later taking up a position as senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne in 1958 he was recruited to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations in 1963 to lead forestry projects in Nigeria before ending up in Rome in 1968.  He also presided over the International Tropical Timbers Organisation (ITTO) and International Union of Foresters before receiving an honorary doctorate from the University of Melbourne in 1994 in recognition for his services to international forestry. 
In the immediate postwar period VSF flourished as the Forests Commission increased its intake of graduates to meet the demands on Victoria's forest resources and the timber needs of the housing boom.
Traditionally, VSF had been promoted as a "gateway to a man's career" with the first group of women entering the forestry school in 1976.
Between 1910 and 1980 a total of 592 students entered the VSF to undertake studies towards the Diploma of Forestry and of these 522 completed the course. In later years, most VSF Diploma graduates went on to further studies at Melbourne University and other tertiary institutes. Over the years, several students did not complete the Diploma course but also found employment with the Forests Commission.
In another development, the Forestry School added a Certificate of Applied Science course in 1977 for forest overseers already employed by the Commission. Temporary accommodation huts were built at the rear of the school affectionately known as Siberia.
VSF museum, grounds and demonstration forest.
In addition to many historic buildings, museums, herbaria and other collections have long been present at the school. In 1912, only three years after the VSF opened, a botany laboratory and a geology museum were founded with a larger museum officially established in 1929. Today the VSF Herbarium is considered to be one of the most significant sub-collections in the Creswick Collection. It is estimated that the herbarium contains 10,000 specimens, representing between 2,500 and 3,000 different species of plants, fungi and insects, collected over more than a century. Among the more important samples are the specimens prepared by Government Botanist Baron Sir Ferdinand von Mueller in 1874 and Dr James Hamlyn Willis, who studied at VSF from 1928 to 1930 and went on to become one of the school's most successful and respected graduates. A large collection of other artifacts, documents, glass slides and photos is housed at the school. A number of notable graduates from VSF Creswick made significant contributions towards understanding the ecology of Victoria's forests.
The school is set on 15 hectares of grounds with many unique specimen trees. A seedling of "Pinus brutia" was propagated from the original tree at Lone Pine at Gallipoli and planted in the grounds on 23 March 1975. The tree was the sole survivor of a group that had been cut down by Turkish soldiers to cover their trenches with the timber and branches during the ferocious battle in 1915. A plaque was also unveiled by Legacy to commemorate soldiers who fought in WW1. A grove of trees was planted in 2009 in front of Tremearne House to honour a famous student from the 1940s, Alfred Leslie.HRH Prince Charles stayed overnight at VSF during his visit on 28 October 1974 and planted a "Eucalyptus leucoxylon" (yellow gum) near the science laboratory.
The school also had a large "demonstration forest" of some 1200 acres set aside within a mile of the campus with native forests and softwood plantations which already exceed 800 acres, together with a large forest nursery established by John La Gerche in the late 1800s. 
In addition to rigorous academic study, VSF had a very strong focus on preparing students suited to Victorian conditions and on acquiring practical skills of forestry. Horsemanship was included in the curriculum at Creswick up until the 1960s and regular field work in the demonstration forest performing thinning, road works, planting or raising seedlings in the nearby nursery were an important part of the Victorian diploma course.
A small park was set aside for the preservation of Koalas by the Minister for Forests, Mr Albert Lind, in November 1942 to mark the centenary of the township of Creswick. The park was fenced to contain the koalas which had been relocated from Phillip Island and was looked after by students as a popular picnic ground with walking trails. Other recreation sites were also constructed and maintained, particularly around St Georges Lake.
In February 1977 a bushfire swept through a large part of the demonstration forest and destroyed many fine old stands of timber established in the 1880s including a plot of ponderosa pine that had been planted for sailing ship masts.
Merger with the University of Melbourne - 1980.
Prior to 1967, VSF had been wholly funded by the Victorian Government through the Forests Commission which was responsible for its day-to-day administration. Commonwealth funding was then made available, but in 1975 the Commonwealth indicated that it was no longer prepared to continue funding for Creswick as a separate, single-discipline institution after 1978 and pointedly proposed an amalgamation with the rapidly expanding Ballarat College of Advanced Education (formally the School of Mines).
Meanwhile, there had been a long association, with some friendly academic and personal rivalries, between VSF, the Forests Commission and the University of Melbourne. So after a period of tumultuous negotiation between two strong minded intellectuals, Dr Frank Moulds, Chairman of the Forests Commission, (and ex Principal of VSF), and the Dean of the University Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry, Dr John Harding Chinner (who attended VSF and graduated as dux in 1931, Rhodes Scholar - 1939), an agreement was finally reached whereby the University took over the administration of VSF at the end of 1980, using both the Creswick and its main Parkville (Melbourne) campus. In 1978, a new Chairman of the Commission was appointed and Alan Threader took a lead role in cementing the new arrangement. As part of the agreement, the Commission ceased offering its Diploma course on condition that the University taught two years of its four-year degree course at Creswick. In the transition period, twelve VSF students completed their first year of the Diploma course in 1979 then transferred to the second year of the Degree course at Melbourne University in 1980. But the era of vocational training in government institutions gave way to university education and the generous fully funded scholarships from the Forests Commission came to an end.
VSF was then renamed the School of Ecosystem and Forest Sciences but retained a basic degree structure, increased the variety of courses, again including diplomas, and greatly extending research, from honours and masters projects to PhDs and post-doctoral level.  Numerous international students studied at Creswick, other faculties and organisations also used the campus, and a timber trade training centre was established nearby.
Later in 1982, saw the appointment of Ian Ferguson as Foundation Professor of Forest Science.
The school celebrated its centenary in 2010 and while the tempo has slowed the Creswick campus remains a major center of Australian forest science.
VSF emblem.
The colours and emblem for the Victorian School of Forestry were designed in 1916 when Charlie Carter became the Principal. He remained Principal until 1926. 
It was a joint effort with the students. Significantly, it was decided by Mr Carter and the students that the institution at Creswick should be a School rather than a College. So it could have easily been VCF. 
The motto Circumspice, which is Latin for “look around you”, was suggested by Mr Carter who believed that foresters should always be observant. 
The plant in the design is "Acacia mollissima" (black wattle) the bark of which was used extensively as a source of tannin used in the leather industry at the time.
The boomerang beneath the crown was incorporated as another Australian element. 
This information was provided in a letter dated March 1973 to the Principal at VSF, Alan Eddy by Sibley Elliott who was a student in 1916 when the emblem was designed.

<doc id="56952605" url="?curid=56952605" title="Hercules Engine Company">
Hercules Engine Company

Hercules Engine Corporation was an American engine manufacturer located in Canton, Ohio.
History.
The company was founded in 1915, known at first as Hercules Motor Manufacturing Company, to build industrial engines, especially for trucks. The company reincorporated and reorganized in 1923, emerging as Hercules Motors Corporation. Hercules expanded greatly in the interwar period, developing gas and diesel engines, serving the needs for truck, tractor and a plethora of equipment operators. 
During World War II the company produced about 750,000 gasoline and diesel engines for Allied military vehicles, ships, and various equipment. But Hercules could not respond effectively to changes in the post-WWII engine market, so WWII remained its high water mark in terms of output, earnings and profits. 
In 1961 Cleveland-based Hupp Corp. purchased Hercules but failed to grow it substantially. But it did turn the focus to building engines for military applications as a means to keep the doors open. White Truck Corp., also based in Cleveland, purchased Hupp in 1967. White Truck was a huge and growing firm at the time (about $1 billion in sales) and it laid out ambitious plans for Hercules expansion, beginning product development and construction of a new plant in Canton. Hercules became known as White Engine at this point. This new trajectory for Hercules was short lived, however, with a rapid decline in White's fortunes, leaving Hercules little changed. White sold Hercules to Wedtech in 1986, which held the engine maker only briefly, before selling to a group of investors the next year. Significant here with the new owners was the recovery of its old name – Hercules. Kept afloat by securing a string of contracts for military trucks at home and abroad, plus a limited number of engine sales to equipment makers (such as lift trucks), Hercules Engine limped along, posting uneven financial numbers. By the 1990s its cash flow was precarious and military contracts dried up, leading to speculation for years that the company would fold. At the time of its closure in 1999, the company occupied a 26-acre site at 101 Eleventh St. SE in Canton, with over 600,000 square feet of industrial space.

List of electoral firsts in New Zealand

List of electoral firsts in New Zealand lists members of the New Zealand Parliament who are notable for age (oldest or youngest) or length of service or by being the “first” for a group e.g. women, Māori, ethnic minorities or LGBT people.
The list is mainly for the House of Representatives rather than the former upper house (the Legislative Council, which was abolished in 1951), and may include the second and third people to attain a position also. Where a source is not given, the source may be the article on the MP.
Members of Parliament are now just referred to as "MPs" or Members of Parliament. Until 1907 members of the House of Representatives were designated "M.H.R." for Members of the House of Representatives. With Dominion status members were designated "M.P." by a Royal Proclamation of 10 September.
Length of service and age.
Shortest-serving MP.
The MP with the shortest period of service is possibly Henry Jackson who served in 1879 from 2 July to 15 August; from the 1879 by-election to the 1879 general election. Jackson was sworn in on 11 July 1879 and parliament sat until 11 August. Another person with a short tenure was William Cutfield King, who won election for the Grey and Bell electorate in the general election held on 27 November 1860. King was killed in the First Taranaki War on 8 February 1861, several months before parliament would next resume. Hence, King was never sworn in.
Ethnic minorities (other than Māori).
Since the introduction of mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) in 1996, a number of people from ethnic minorities (other than Māori) have been selected by their party for the party list (some came into parliament between elections to replace a retiring list MP).

Archibald R. Murray

Archibald R. Murray (August 25, 1933 – September 16, 2001) was an American lawyer born in Barbados, who became the first African-American president of the New York State Bar Association and the second African-American chairman of the executive committee of the New York City Bar Association.
He immigrated to the United States in 1950, earning his Bachelor's degree from Howard University in 1954 and the Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree from Fordham University School of Law in 1960. Upon graduation from law school he became an assistant district attorney in New York County (Manhattan). In 1962, he became assistant counsel to Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York. From 1965 to 1967, he was in private practice in New York City, then became counsel to the New York State Crime Control Council until 1971.
Murray served as Commissioner of the State of New York's Division of Criminal Justice Services from 1972 to 1974. On January 1, 1975, he began a lengthy career at The Legal Aid Society, serving from 1975 to 1994 as Attorney-in-Chief and Executive Director, and later as Chairman of the Board until 1998. Murray was said to have "helped to raise the standard of the free legal advice provided for poor and indigent defendants facing criminal charges in New York City."
He died on September 16, 2001, in New York City, survived by his wife of 40 years, Kay Crawford Murray.
Honors.
During his lifetime, Murray was awarded honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from New York Law School (1988), John Jay College of Criminal Justice (City University of New York) (1990), and Fordham University (1992).
Murray's alma mater, Fordham University School of Law, has established both an Archibald R. Murray Public Service Award and an Archibald R. Murray Professorship. The former is awarded to students in the graduating class of the law school who have devoted 50 or more hours to pro bono and/or community service work during their years as Fordham law students. Those graduates completing 250–499 hours receive the "cum laude" Murray Award, those completing 500–999 hours the "magna cum laude" Murray Award, and students completing 1000+ hours receive the "summa cum laude" Murray Award. The text of the award reads, "in grateful acknowledgment of your response to the call of public need as exemplified by Archibald R. Murray, Class of 1960, whose career embodies the highest standards of public service." As of Fall 2017, the Fordham University School of Law Archibald R. Murray Professorship was held by Tanya K. Hernández.
In 2007, The Legal Aid Society announced the creation of the Archibald R. Murray Memorial Fund for Law Student Loan Forgiveness "to honor the memory of Arch Murray and celebrate his many accomplishments that helped to provide quality legal services for low-income New Yorkers."
Notable letters, memoranda and statements.
In April 1974, while serving as Commissioner at the Division of Criminal Justice Services, Murray authored a memorandum addressed to the Office of Governor Malcolm Wilson opposing the signing of a bill, Assembly Bill No. 8667-A, that made mere possession of "chuka sticks" or nunchaku a crime even without any criminal intent by the possessor. Murray noted in the memo that nunchaku are used in karate and other martial arts training and that, "in view of the current interest and participation in these activities by many members of the public, it appears unreasonable--and perhaps even unconstitutional--to prohibit those who have a legitimate reason for possessing chuka sticks from doing so." On December 14, 2018, Murray's vision was given real-world application: the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York struck down New York's nunchaku prohibitions as unconstitutional.
In December 1974, after it was announced that Murray had been chosen to run The Legal Aid Society, and the president of the union that represented most of its staff lawyers had expressed reservations about Murray's suitability because in his prior office he had strongly supported the Rockefeller drug laws and mandatory sentencing, Murray was directly quoted in the "New York Times" as having responded: "As a lawyer, I see nothing difficult in arguing a case in which you are on one side today and the other side tomorrow."
In September 1982, in an article in "New York" magazine about the challenges then being faced by The Legal Aid Society, Murray was directly quoted as saying: "As soon as people became afraid of crime, they began to lose their balance and forget that defendants have rights, too."
In October 1994, in the wake of Mayor Rudy Giuliani's decision to terminate New York City's contract with The Legal Aid Society, Murray sent a letter to the City's Corporation Counsel, Paul A. Crotty, arguing that Giuliani had no legal basis for terminating the contract. In the letter, Murray pointed out that, during a brief strike by Legal Aid Society staff lawyers earlier that month, Legal Aid Society supervisors had handled civil and criminal cases so that "no chaos or gridlock resulted in the courts."

Michelle Gregor

Michelle Gregor (born 1960, USA) is a San Francisco-based figurative sculptor. She works in mid-fire stoneware ceramic and porcelain.
Early life and education.
Gregor was born in San Francisco and raised in Tahoe City, California by a family supportive of her academic exploration in the liberal arts. She holds a BFA in Studio Art from University of California, Santa Cruz in 1983, where she studied printmaking, ceramics, Eastern religion and French Symbolist poetry. After undergraduate school, Gregor conducted informal studies in ceramics through extensive travel abroad. In 1994, she received her MFA in Ceramics from San Francisco State University, where she studied under sculptor Stephen DeStaebler.
Work.
Gregor is known for her abstracted human figure sculptures, featuring complex layers of underglaze and glaze and occasionally metallic lusters. Gregor builds her forms out of solid clay, then slices them open with a strong wire to enable hollowing as the clay enters its dryer 'leather hard' stage. She then reassembles the pieces for drying and kiln firing. Each piece endures as many as seven or eight firings, giving them their characteristic liquid, yet hard surfaces. Her works, some up to life-size in scale, convey a sense of balance and mass, seemingly on the edge of flight. Despite their grandiosity, Gregor's figures often carry a humility, a restraint in gesture and expression.
Gregor has been called a 'descendant' of sculptors as diverse as Robert Arneson, Peter Voulkos and Viola Frey, and is considered an important second-generation sculptor in the Bay Area Figurative Group, succeeding artists such as Manuel Neri and Stephen DeStaebler. Her contemporaries include Susannah Israel, John Toki, Arthur Gonzalez and Lisa Reinertson.
Teaching.
Gregor is a tenured Professor of Art and head of the ceramics program at San Jose City College, where since 2002 she has taught ceramics, sculpture and 3-D design. She has held sculpting the human figure in clay workshops at Office for the Arts at Harvard, Mendocino Arts Center, Berkeley Potters' Studio, and Sierra Nevada College, among other colleges and art centers across the United States.
She has instructed ceramic sculpture workshops abroad at Estudio Paloma in San Miguel de Allende, MX, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Fellow ceramic artists from the United States and Mexico teaching at Estudio Paloma include Tip Toland, Esther Shimazu, Adrian Arleo and Claudia Olds Goldie. As part of its annual series of workshops given by some of the finest international ceramic artists worldwide, Gaya Ceramic Arts Center in Ubud Bali, Indonesia hosted a figure sculpture workshop by Gregor in 2018.
Gregor has given hands-on demonstrations of sculpture making and lectured widely about figuration in clay at ceramic art exhibitions and symposia, including the Annual California Conference for the Advancement of Ceramic Arts (CCACA) and Ceramic Sculptors Exhibition and Conference and Ceramics Annual of America (CAA), an exhibition and art fair spotlighting the quality and diversity of contemporary ceramics from around the world.

Relativity Space

Relativity Space is an American aerospace manufacturing company headquartered in Los Angeles, California. It was founded in 2015 by Tim Ellis and Jordan Noone. Relativity Space is developing manufacturing technologies, launch vehicles and rocket engines for commercial orbital launch services.
History.
Relativity Space was founded by CEO Tim Ellis and CTO Jordan Noone on the idea that existing NewSpace companies were not tapping enough into the potential of additive manufacturing (3D printing). Relativity is aiming to be the first company to successfully launch a fully 3D-printed launch vehicle into orbit.
In November 2020, Relativity Space announced its US$500 million Series D funding at a calculated US$2.3 billion valuation. In June 2021 Relativity announced another US$650 million funding round led by Fidelity Investments at a valuation of US$4.2 billion, bringing its total funding to US$1.335 billion. The funding will help the development of a fully reusable medium lift launch vehicle, the Terran R, targeting the first orbital launch not earlier than 2024.
The company anticipates it will launch its first rocket, named Terran 1, in early 2022.
Facilities.
Headquarters.
Relativity Space announced a new Long Beach, California headquarters and factory in February 2020. , the new headquarters is planned to house both business operations and Relativity's autonomous development operations that the company plans to build into a modern rocket manufacturing factory in the coming years. According to an interview with CEO Tim Ellis in early 2020, the factory is planned to have no fixed tooling, which is hoped to allow it to be rapidly reconfigured and autonomous. A new 93,000-square-metre (1,000,000 sq ft) factory was announced in June 2021, with Relativity set to takeover the former Boeing C-17 production plant in January 2022 to begin production of its Terran R reusable launch vehicle.
Stennis Space Center.
In March 2018, Relativity Space signed a 20-year lease at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi, a NASA rocket testing facility, to test engine components and eventually full-scale test their Aeon 1 rocket engines. And in June 2019, Relativity Space expanded their work with the Stennis Space Center to include exclusive use of within Building 9101. In mid-2019, Relativity Space planned to create 200 jobs and invest US$59 million in Mississippi over the course of this nine-year lease, which carries an option to extend for another 10 years.
Cape Canaveral LC-16.
In January 2019, Relativity Space announced that it won a competitive bidding process with the United States Air Force to build and operate Launch Complex 16 (LC-16) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. LC-16 has historical significance having been previously used by the US military to launch Titan and Pershing ballistic missiles.
Vandenberg Space Force Base Building 330.
In June 2020, Relativity Space announced it plans to develop a second launch pad at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California to launch payloads into polar orbits and Sun-synchronous orbits, including the Iridium satellite launches, between 2023 and 2030.
Products.
Rocket engines.
Aeon 1.
The Aeon 1 rocket engine is designed to produce at sea level and in a vacuum. The engine is powered by liquid natural gas (LNG) and liquid oxygen (LOX). It is made out of a proprietary 3D-printed alloy. It is printed by selective laser sintering and assembled from fewer than 100 parts. By June 2021, Relativity Space had completed more than 500 test firings of its Aeon 1 engine, using the E-3 test facility at NASA's Stennis Space Center.
Aeon R.
The rocket engine Aeon R is under development to produce 302,000 pounds-force (1,300 kN) of thrust. It will be the main engine of the Terran R first stage.
Launch vehicles.
Terran 1.
Terran 1 is an expendable launch vehicle under development that will consist of two stages. As of 2020, the first stage was planned to use nine Aeon 1 engines, while the second stage was being planned to use a single Aeon 1 engine. The maximum payload was expected to be to low Earth orbit (LEO), normal payload to Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO), high-altitude payload to SSO. Relativity's advertised launch price was US$12 million per Terran 1 mission in June 2020. As of August 2021, Relativity hopes to conduct the first launch of Terran 1 in early 2022.
Terran R.
The Terran R is a fully reusable launch vehicle under development designed to compete with SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket. The first stage will use seven Aeon R engines, while the second stage will used an upgraded Aeon 1 engine with a copper chamber. With this design, Relativity is aiming to exceed the Falcon 9 payload to low-Earth orbit by approximately 20 percent, with a target payload mass of approximately , with a long term goal to make the first orbital launch as early as 2024.
Stargate.
In order to 3D print large components, Relativity Space has created a system named Stargate, which it claims is the world's largest 3D printer of metals. Stargate uses existing welding technology to melt metal wire, layer by layer, into precise and complex structures that have minimal joints and parts. The company aims at 3D-printing at least 95% of their launcher, including the engines, by the end of 2020. The company plans to eventually 3D-print a complete launch vehicle within 60 days.
Launch contracts.
, Relativity Space has pre-sold more launches than any other company in the private space industry since SpaceX.
Timeline of publicly announced launch contracts.
On 5 April 2019, Relativity Space announced its first signed contract. This contract was with Telesat, the Canadian telecom satellite operator. The terms of this contract were not specified, but it did include "multiple" launches of Terran 1.

Wilma Z. Davis

Wilma Zimmerman Davis (31 March 1912 – 10 December 2001) was an early American codebreaker during World War II. She was a leading national cryptanalyst before and during World War II and the Vietnam War. She graduated with a degree in Mathematics from Bethany College and successfully completed navy correspondence course in cryptology. She began her career as a leading cryptanalyst which spanned over 30 years in the United States Army Signal Intelligence Service (SIS), a predecessor of the National Security Agency (NSA) in the 1930s. She was hired by William Friedman, who was a US cryptographer in the Army and led the research division of the Army’s Signal Intelligence in the 1930s. Wilma Davis worked as a cryptanalyst on the Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Russian problems. She also worked on the VENONA project.
Early life and education.
She grew up in a steel town called Beech Bottom, West Virginia which had about 400 people, a church, a pool room, a drug store, and a company store. She had three siblings and her father worked for a steel company. She went to high school in Wellsburg, West Virginia and graduated in 1928. Wilma attended a small college - Bethany College which had about three hundred and fifty students at the time. She graduated with a degree in Mathematics in 1932. She was actively involved in college, so much so that she sometimes couldn’t make it home for Christmas. Her father gave her only a thousand dollars as she left college because that’s all he could afford to give her. Her mother passed away a few months before she graduated from college.
Career.
After graduating from college, Wilma was meant to teach high school, but she ended up teaching first graders due to lack of jobs for high school teachers. After a year, she took a job in her hometown as a Math teacher, where she worked for four years and made about ninety dollars a month. Since teachers only worked for nine months in the year, she made about eight hundred and ten dollars a year. Due to the demise of her mother, Wilma was responsible for taking care of the house while her siblings were in high school. Thereafter, she worked in a payroll office and later as a code clerk at the unemployment census.
Wilma Davis’ interest in cryptology was piqued after reading in the Washington Star about William and Elizabeth Freidman, who were American codebreakers. She was enrolled in some Navy correspondence courses in cryptology by her brother-in-law who was a civil servant. Davis relished the courses in cryptology and excelled in them. She decided to sit for the Civil Service exam and got on the civil service register. She worked at the National Bureau of Aeronautics (NBS) for about nine months before she received her civil service stats. She worked at the Civil Service Commission as a junior Civil Service Examiner and that’s where she was given her first job as a cryptanalyst by William Friedman in 1937 or 1938. There was a big expansion in the Signal Intelligence and Friedman was looking to recruit individuals to work there. Friedman offered Wilma $1620 while she was making about $1440. She had to put her name on a sign-in sheet and she was 19 on the list. Wilma was ecstatic about this opportunity, more so, because her William Friedman and his wife were the major driving force of her cryptology interest.
In March 1941, she was first assigned to work with Dr. Abe Sinkov on breaking the Italian diplomatic codes. The Italians invented their own encryption machines, US codenamed as the Japanese Purple Machines, which were improvements of the German Enigma machine. The Italians used their machines to transmit high-level military secrets mainly to diplomats and military officials in Berlin, Washington, and London to avoid intrusions or interceptions from other nations. The Italian intercepts came from Western Union and the British were instrumental in breaking the Italian code. Wilma and her colleagues worked on the Italian problem while taking cryptology courses. They were responsible for getting the messages, organizing it, recording it, filing it, and deciphering the messages.
In July 1942, she was assigned to “Department A” which was responsible for working on code messages from the Japanese Army. William Friedman initially worked on breaking the Japanese codes. In two years working in Department A, she was put in charge of the unit whose duty was to analyze and interpret the addresses which were linked to the messages of the Japanese military. One of the main goals of deciphering the Japanese messages was to figure out the Japanese Order of Battle. Wilma worked alongside Ann Caracristi, first female deputy of the NSA, to break the Japanese codes. Wilma was revered for her deep knowledge, prioritize assignments, successfully onboard new team members, and unwavering dedication to her work. The successful work of her team on the Japanese problem allowed the US to gain an upper hand on the Japanese. The Japanese machine was one of the most sophisticated cipher machines in that era and breaking it gave the US access to top-level Japanese messages during World War II. In an NSA interview with Working on the Japanese problem was one of the highest points of Wilma’s cryptology career.
At the end of the war, she was requested to work on to the Chinese team which was led by Dr. Leslie Rutledge, an NSA scholar. The request was made by Mr. Frank Rowlett, who was the chief of the Intelligence Division from 1945 to 1947. Frank Rowlett had put Wilma in a difficult situation by asking her to take charge of the Chinese project and report back to him. Essentially asking her to run the project without any regard for Leslie Rutledge who was the head. This made Wilma become conflicted as it went against her convictions. It bothered Wilma so much that she became physically sick and went to see her doctor. According to her doctor, she was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. She eventually verbalized her concerns to Mr. Rowlett and he found someone else to take charge which was a great relief to Wilma. Wilma indicated that she had no ill feelings towards Dr. Leslie Rutledge and they both worked together on starting the missile problem.
After working with the Chinese team, she moved to the VENONA Project trying to break Soviet messages. The information obtained from working on the VENONA project was instrumental in the Soviet’s activities during the Cold War. Wilma Davis worked on the VENONA project until 1949, then got married and moved to Canada with her second husband, John Mason. After the demise of her second husband, John Mason, Wilma received a telegram from William Friedman to return to work in Washington D.C. Wilma was put in charge of the Russian Diplomatic problem. She was then reassigned to the VENONA project in 1952 after the death of John Mason. Wilma left her cryptology work again after marrying her third husband, John Davis. She took up the position of assistant director of production. Wilma remained an avid supporter of John Davis in all his roles which contributed to his accomplishments.
Wilma Davis left the cryptologic field a few times during her career, but she could not stay away. She returned to work on Venona and returned a second time during the Vietnam War. Despite leaving and returning twice to cryptology over her career, she finally retired in 1973. Wilma Davis concluded her career as a pioneer cryptanalyst as the senior executive of the Cryptanalytic Career Panel. In the years following her retirement, Wilma Davis lived in Fairfax, Virginia.
Family life.
During her early years as a cryptanalyst, she was known as Wilma Berryman. Wilma was married and widowed three times. She met her first husband, John Berryman, at Bethany College. They were both classmates and moved to Washington D.C in the 1930s. John Berryman worked at the general accounting office in Washington D.C. at the time. John Berryman died six months after Wilma began working for the Signal Intelligence. In the fall of 1949, she married her second husband, John Mason, who was a Major in the British Army. She relocated to Canada with John Mason, who died suddenly in summer of 1952 while visiting her sister, Helen, in Erie, Pennsylvania. Wilma returned to the US to continue her job as a cryptanalyst and married her third husband, John Davis, who was a Brigadier General.
Legacy and death.
Wilma Davis is featured as one of 18 leading women in cryptology by the National Cryptologic Museum Foundation. Wilma Davis is recognized as an Honoree of the Women in American Cryptology by the National Security Agency (NSA). An article written by her in the Phoenician describes her as “one of the Founding Mothers of cryptology”. Benson K. Buffman describes her as one of the most gifted cryptanalysts of Arlington Hall. Wilma Davis died on December 10, 2001, at the age of 89 and currently buried beside her third husband, John Davis, at the Arlington National Cemetery in Fort Myer Arlington, Virginia.

St. Lawrence Anglican Cathedral Ambohimanoro

St. Lawrence Anglican Cathedral Ambohimanoro (also known as Saint Laurent in French and Malagasy) is an Anglican cathedral in Madagascar's capital of Antananarivo. Located in the upper part of the city, the cathedral was built on the hill of Ambohimanoro, near the Andohalo square, and has now been designated as a national heritage by the Malagasy government. It is one of the first permanent Anglican churches built on the island.
History.
During the reign of Ranavalona I Christians in Madagascar were persecuted and church building suppressed. However, in the succeeding monarchs' reigns, European influence grew and the suppression of Christians was relaxed, with many missionaries, most notably those belonging to the London Missionary Society being invited back in. A turning point in the history of Christianity in Madagascar happened when queen Ranavalona II who had been in part raised by European tutors converted to Christianity.
During this time period Anglican missionaries from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel were sent to Madagascar. Several years later the first Anglican bishop Kestell Kestell-Cornish was sent to Madagascar. He resided near Ambohimanoro where his congregation met in a small wooden church at Ambatomasina, near the cathedral's current location. Eventually he was given permission to build a permanent building. Assisted by the bishop, the first stone was laid in 1883 by then prime minister Rainilaiarivony. The church was designed by English architect William White and built by Norwegian Alfred Anker in the neo-Gothic style. Since its completion in 1889, several renovations have taken place, most notably the replacement of the stained glass windows that have been imported from England as well as the replacement of the roof tiles.
In October 2017 Princess Anne attended a Service of Thanksgiving to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Diplomatic relationship between Madagascar and the United Kingdom at the cathedral, alongside Madagascar president Hery Rajaonarimampianina during her visit to the country, making it the highest ranked member of the British royal family to officially visit the location.
Bishops.
The following bishops have been seated at St. Lawrence Cathedral, as bishops of Madagascar until 1969 when the diocese was divided and the Cathedral became the seat of the bishop for the diocese of Antananarivo.

Abi Masatora

 is a Japanese professional sumo wrestler from Saitama Prefecture. He made his debut in May, 2013 and wrestles for Shikoroyama stable. He reached the top "makuuchi" division in January 2018 and has two special prizes for Fighting Spirit and two "gold stars" for "yokozuna" upsets. His highest rank has been "komusubi".
Early life and sumo experience.
Kōsuke Horikiri was born as the youngest of four children, born into a family that ran a construction company. He was a head taller than most of his classmates as a student. Unlike other members of his family, he was not inclined towards sports as he was somewhat overweight and didn't like running. He tried judo, but found he excelled more at sumo; taking the children's sumo championship in his city in both his first and second years of primary school. Though he was skilled at sumo, he didn't like the sport at first, especially practice, and would often try to avoid it. As the sumo at the city level was not challenging enough he began participating in national children's sumo tournaments but achieved little success. He did not see sumo in his future but as most of his friends were involved in the sport, he continued. Having a very gregarious nature, he made friends quickly at tournaments, among them being future "makuuchi" wrestlers Daieishō and Hokutōfuji.
In junior high school Horikiri began to find sumo more appealing, placing well in tournaments. This culminated in taking 3rd place in the national junior high school sumo tournament in Kagoshima. Horikiri recalled being so certain he would be eliminated on the first day, that he brought a swimsuit for swimming in the nearby sea so he would have something to do for the rest of the tournament.
He transferred to Nagareyama High School and joined the sumo club. One of his classmates there was future Daishōhō. He was successful at the high school level, often placing in the best sixteen. In his 3rd year of high school, he placed 3rd in the 61st Towada Sumo Tournament in the individual category, losing to the future "san'yaku" wrestler Ichinojō.
His family hoped he would go on to university and continue sumo there, but Horikiri instead expressed interest in taking over the family business. Not long afterwards, without consulting his parents he made the decision to enter Shikoroyama stable because his sumo coach was close with its head, the former Terao. His parents had not expected this sudden change and were reluctant to meet with his coach at first, but Horikiri convinced them of his fervor.
Career.
In his first tournament in July 2013 he achieved a 6–1 record, losing only to Ikeru (who himself was also in his debut and went on to win the "jonokuchi" championship). In the following tournament in September, in the "jonidan" division, he had a 7–0 record, and took the championship, beating Aokishin in a playoff. In the next tournament, which was his "sandanme" debut, he only achieved a 4–3 but following that in January 2014 he got another perfect record and took the "sandanme" division championship. Over the next year, he posted four winning tournaments out of six. He was promoted to the salaried ranks of "jūryō" for the March 2015 tournament along with Amakaze and Ishiura. On this promotion, he chose the "shikona" of Abi which was the idea of his coach the aforementioned former "sekiwake" Terao. Abi was pronounced the same as Shikoroyama coach's nickname. The characters used were chosen in the hope that Horikiri could be strong like the many armed Asura (of which the first character is the same as in Abi's first character) and "on fire" in the ring (the second character means "flaming").
Though he lasted four tournaments in the division, he only managed one winning tournament and was demoted back to "makushita" after the September 2015 tournament. He spent the next eight tournaments moving up and down the top third of the "makushita" division. In the March 2017 tournament at "makushita" 16 he got a 7–0 record and took the championship. He would follow this with a strong 5-2 in May, which would finally garner re-promotion to "jūryō" in July 2017, in which he achieved a winning tournament (8–7). In the next tournament in September at "jūryō" 11 he posted a 10–5 record and on the final day beat both Homarefuji and Kotoyuki in a playoff to take the championship. An 11–4 record at "jūryō" 5 in November would propel him to the top flight "makuuchi" division for the first time. In his debut in January 2018 at "maegashira" 14 he had a record of 10–5 and earned the Fighting Spirit Prize along with Ryūden. Another 10-5 for the March 2018 tournament saw him promoted to "maegashira" 2 for the May tournament, where he recorded only seven wins but earned his first "kinboshi" by defeating the "yokozuna" Hakuhō on day 6. He won his second "kinboshi" in consecutive tournaments in July 2018 with a victory over Kakuryū on Day 5. In May 2019 he won ten bouts and shared the Fighting Spirit prize with tournament winner Asanoyama and top division debutant Shimanoumi. Abi clinched the prize on the final day by defeating Tamawashi, and said he was inspired by Asanoyama, who is the same age. This performance earned him promotion to the "sanyaku" ranks for the first time at "komusubi." He followed up with 8–7 and 9–6 records in the next two tournaments but did not get promoted to "sekiwake" as there were no openings at that rank (with it being filled by Mitakeumi and the demoted "ōzeki" Takakeishō in September and Tochinoshin in November).
He was reprimanded by the Japan Sumo Association in November 2019 after he posted an image on Instagram of his friend and fellow wrestler Wakamotoharu tied up and gagged with tape as a prank. It was deemed inappropriate and Abi and Wakamotoharu apologized in person to JSA chairman Hakkaku and the board for the incident. The JSA has advised wrestlers not to post on their individual social media in future, although accounts run by the stables are not affected. In the following November tournament in Kyushu he produced another 9–6 record from the rank of "komusubi" East. He was ranked at "komusubi" on the January 2020 "banzuke" for the fourth tournament in a row; the first time this has happened since Kisenosato spent four straight tournaments at "komusubi" from July 2006 until January 2007. In February 2020 he was reprimanded again after he told reporters, unprompted, that he had slept through a workshop organized by the Sumo Association to explain the changes to their social media policy that he had instigated.
He was withdrawn by his stablemaster partway through the July 2020 tournament after he admitted to twice visiting a hostess bar with a low-ranking wrestler from another stable, against the guidance on nonessential travel given by the Sumo Association to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The Sumo Association chairman Hakkaku called his actions "unpardonable." Abi submitted a retirement notice through his stablemaster on August 4, which was not immediately accepted. Later that week, the Sumo Association suspended Abi for three tournaments and reduced his pay and that of his stablemaster while rejecting his resignation. It emerged that he had gone out several more times than the two occasions to which he had admitted. Despite having recently got married, he was told to move back into his stable and be under strict supervision. His retirement papers are being kept on file by the Sumo Association and will be activated if there are any further transgressions.
Abi was next eligible to compete in the March 2021 tournament, where he was ranked at "makushita" 56. He won both the March and May tournaments with perfect 7-0 records, ensuring his return to "sekitori" for the July 2021 "basho".
Family.
Abi was married in June 2020 after a three year relationship. They have one daughter.
Fighting style.
Abi is a "tsuki/oshi" specialist, meaning he prefers to slap and push his opponents rather than fighting on the "mawashi" or belt. His most common winning "kimarite" are "oshi-dashi" (push out), "hataki-komi" (slap down) and "tsuki-dashi" (thrust out).

Blanchet House

Blanchet House is a non-profit social services organization located in Portland, Oregon providing meals, transitional housing, drug and alcohol recovery programs, and support services to those struggling with homelessness and addiction. As a House of Hospitality, Blanchet House welcomes everyone to enjoy hot meals without question six days a week, three times a day. Founded in 1952, by a group of University of Portland students encouraged by their priest to "get out in the streets and help."
History.
In the early 1940s, a group of University of Portland students started a fraternity called the Blanchet Club. The club took their name from Oregon’s first pioneer Catholic priest, Rev. Francis Norbert Blanchet. The students were encouraged by their club chaplain to “Do something meaningful” so they began doing acts of charity like serving sandwiches and coffee out of the back of a car to those experiencing homelessness and food insecurity. The founders believed that everyone in the world has a right to food, clothing, and shelter. They wanted to provide the poor, sick, homeless and unwanted people of Portland a place of immediate relief with no moral judgments or religious requirements. The men wanted to have a larger impact on the community, so they began searching for a permanent location to serve meals from. 
In 1952, the Blanchet Club was able to rent the bottom floor of the building next door for their House of Hospitality. On Feb. 11, the group served its first meal to 227 people. 66 years later, Blanchet House now serve three meals a day, six days a week to on average 1,000 people a day. It is a house of hospitality, inspired by the Catholic Worker’s Movement. Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin created the "Catholic Worker" newspaper and then opened up houses of hospitality and farms. People across America, like the founders of Blanchet House, were so inspired by their activism that they started their own Catholic Worker communities, each one independent from each other. Now, the Catholic Worker movement can be seen as a dialogue between Catholic social teaching and radical Christian anarchism.
In 1962, a farm in Carlton, Oregon was purchased by Blanchet House which hosts a residential program for men who are rebuilding their lives from drug and alcohol addiction, job loss and other obstacles.
In 2010, Blanchet House received city approval to construct a new facility (at the former site of the Dirty Duck 
) which opened in 2012.
Blanchet House celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2012 by honoring supporters like Tracy Oseran, founder of Urban Gleaners and Portland City Commissioner Nick Fish who helped secure the site for their new building.
Programs.
Free meals program.
Blanchet House serves nutritious meals in their Founders Cafe to anyone in need. Their public cafe is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, Monday to Saturday. All are welcome. No questions asked. Blanchet House can serve up to 1,500 meals a day. 
Impact.
In 2020, over 400,000 plates of food were served to the hungry in the Old Town part of downtown Portland. Blanchet House prepares and delivers meals to Portland's outdoor emergency shelters. 175 men were provided with life-changing housing, clothing, support, and basic needs through Blanchet House's residential program. As well as 400,000 lbs of fresh food were rescued from different vendors throughout the city, such as Trader Joe's, the convention center, and Whole Foods.
Sustainability and Green Initiatives.
Blanchet House is committed to creating as little food waste as possible. Blanchet House has different partnerships throughout the city to rescue their unused food. One of the most popular days for meal guests is on Saturday for Blanchet's pizza day. Unused slices from popular pizza places are collected and redistributed. 
Blanchet House is unique amongst public kitchens in that it has nearly zero food waste. Blanchet sends its own leftover food waste to two different farms in the area including its own, Blanchet Farm. The food waste is turned into slop for pigs and other farm animals. 
Blanchet's building itself is Leed Platinum Certified. The roof of the building serves as a green roof. Every time it rains, the water is collected and filtered through the roof and used as greywater throughout the building.
Residential housing program.
In addition to Blanchet House's free meal program, they operate a transitional living program for men at two different locations. The downtown location houses up to 55 men living here at any given time. In exchange for room, board and case management they volunteer to prepare and serve food for the free meal service. The men living at Blanchet House are working to rebuild their lives after struggling with homelessness, addiction, job loss and other issues. Unlike the low-barrier meal service where anyone is welcome, the residential program is a high barrier. Men must be sober during their time at Blanchet House. 
The second location is out at a farm located in Carlton, Oregon. The founders wanted a second location away from the temptations of the city so that men could fully focus on their recovery. 22 men live on the farm where they do meaningful work like caring for animals, beekeeping, woodworking, gardening, and support each other in rebuilding their lives from addiction. Items from the woodshop are sold at different stores in downtown Portland that feature local craftsmen.
Volunteer.
Blanchet House would not be able to carry out its mission without its set of dedicated volunteers. Each meal service requires 12 volunteers per shift. Volunteers help with plating the food, serving meals to the guest's restaurant-style, and cleaning the tables after guests leave. Cooperate groups and schools (such as Kaiser Permamente, Wells Fargo, Jesuit High School, and Central Catholic) are the most frequented volunteers, but individuals can sign up online.

Victor Kord

Victor George Kord (born 1935) American painter and educator. He currently maintains a studio and exhibits in New York City. He previously served as art department chair for several major universities, and remains professor emeritus of painting at Cornell University Department of Art.
Early life.
Kord was born Victor George Katz in Satu Mare, Romania. The family immigrated to Canada to avoid the threat of war in 1938. They moved to Ukiah, California in 1943 and the family name changed to Kord. They subsequently moved to Cleveland, Ohio in 1945.
Kord graduated from the Cleveland Institute of Art in 1957 where he studied with Louis Bosa, was friends with Julian Stanczak and was mentored by Richard Anuszkiewicz. He then studied at Yale School of Art with Joseph Albers and James Brooks, receiving a Bachelor of Fine Art in 1958 and a Master of Fine Art in 1960.
Career.
Educator.
Kord taught painting at four different universities beginning as instructor at the Department of Art, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, from 1960–1965, where he taught watercolor to architects and drawing and design to art students.
From 1965–1981, he served as professor of painting at the Department of Art, University of Wisconsin–Madison, taking the position of chair between 1979–1981. He taught painting to undergraduate and graduates and introduced the course based on Alber's method of color interaction.
He moved to Richmond, Virginia to become chair and professor at the Department of Painting and Printmaking at Virginia Commonwealth University, from 1981 through 1987.
His final professorship began in 1987 at Cornell University's Department of Art in Ithaca, New York. He continued as department chair until 1993 and retired Professor Emeritus in 2005. Rosy Keyser, a New York artist who studied with Kord at Cornell, said that "his work exemplified the freedom to attribute abstract ideas to firmly planted materials."
He helped to sponsor many visiting artists to art departments. Richard Artschwager, an early collaborator and lifelong friend, included Kord in the catalogue of his Whitney Museum retrospective. In a conceptual work shown at William Wegman's 2015 Brooklyn Museum retrospective, Kord appeared in "Five Figures at Six Feet," 1969.
In 2019 Kord was invited to participate on the "Longevity to Legacy Panel" at the annual College Art Association conference.
Painter.
In 1971 early in his career, Kord was included in the exhibition "Lyrical Abstraction" curated by Larry Aldrich at the Aldrich Museum in Ridgefield, Connecticut. The exhibition was shown again at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City to note Lyrical Abstraction as a trend in abstraction away from minimal and hard-edge to a softer, more sensuous form of painting. Aldrich said about the American lyrical artists he discovered, "The artist's touch is always visible in this type of painting, even when the paintings are done with spray guns, sponges or other objects."
Carter Ratcliffe considered the Lyrical Abstraction movement to be revisionist, or in his words, "The happy dazzle of their colors could looked pedantic. . . (however) a few tagged with this label - John Torreano, Victor Kord, Philip Wofford, John Seery - turned out to be good painters."
Much of Kord's painting practice was during his academic appointments. In 1967 he received a faculty fellowship from the University of Wisconsin to work in Paris where he exhibited at Galerie Mathias-Fels.
From 1970 to 1973 he took a leave of absence from the University of Wisconsin in order to live and work in New York City. In 1970 he had a solo exhibition in Koln, Germany at Galerie Rolfe Ricke. The next year he was represented by French &amp; Company Gallery and participated in a group exhibition at Andre Emmerich Gallery, both New York City galleries. It was at that point that he became associated with the Lyrical Abstraction group.
Other group exhibitions included "New American Abstract Paintings" that in 1972 was presented by Vassar College Art Gallery in Poughkeepsie, NY. The exhibition catalogue's introduction mirrors the painterly approach of the Lyrical Abstract movement. ". . .the emphasis placed by artists in this exhibition on textural values is contrasted with the hard, flat, seemingly de-physicalized surfaces which are characteristic of so much recent art."
In 1977 Walker Art Center presented "Invitation '77: Ten Painters" which featured paintings, drawings, and collages from midwest region artists. It was curated by Lisa Lyons.
As an active member of the artist group American Abstract Artists, Kord participated in many group shows. In 2011 Ivan Karp of OK Harris Gallery curated and presented better and lesser known artists of this group in an exceptionally spacious and well considered exhibition. Along with David Reed and Don Voisine, Barbara A. MacAdam said in ARTnews that "Voisine's thin, vertical "Debutante Twist" (2009) and Victor Kord's "Avon IV" (2009), hanging side by side, set off a thoughtful contrast between almost-edgy and almost-lyrical. Kord's painting expresses the interaction between the rational and the poetic, with a rhythmic cursive frieze playing against a soft pattern."
The most definitive of the American Abstract Artist group exhibitions was "The Onward of Art: Abstract Artist's 80th Anniversary" which took place in 2016 to showcase the vigor and relevance of abstraction in twenty first century America. Its catalogue revisits the organization's extensive history of such well known abstractionists as Mondrian and Albers and places current members within the context, of an abstraction that communicates directly through the eye to reach our intellect and our emotions without words.
Kord's solo exhibitions with the June Kelly Gallery in New York City began in 2008. They include "Algorithm and Blues", 2008, with an accompanying essay by Eleanor Heartney, "Hiding in Plain Sight", 2011, "Cut-Out: New Paintings", 2014, "Anonymous Collaborations", 2016, "Making Ends Meet: New Works, 2019." A selection of his works is also viewable online at the Artist's Viewing Program of the Drawing Center.
Kord was also active locally in university art communities where he often curated exhibitions of other artists. At the Madison Art Center, Madison, Wisconsin he presented "Recent Works on Paper by American Artists: Victor Kord and Joseph Wilfer", catalogue.
Awards and Collections.
In 1962 Victor Kord received the Guggenheim fellowship, one of the youngest at 26 to receive the award. He maintained a studio at the American Center in Paris, France where he met the critic Max Kozloff, and artists Irving Petlin, Leon Golub, Nancy Spero, Seymour Rosofsky and Pater Saul.
Examples of Kord's art are held in the permanent collections of Ellen Noёl Art Museum, the Cleveland Museum of Art, and Whitney Museum of American Art, Chazen Museum of Art, and Madison Museum of Contemporary Art.

Second Battle of Maryang-san

The Second Battle of Maryang-san (5 November 1951) was fought during the Korean War, in which British forces, possessing a hill top and surrounding area, were overwhelmed by Chinese forces.
Background.
By this stage in the Korean War the frontline had been consolidated with fortifications, and there was not much movement. Rather like World War One, strategic objectives would be hills or specific areas of land, rather than sweeping objectives or pushes. By September 1950, Australian and Canadian forces, as part of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade left the area, and were replaced by the British 29th Infantry Brigade Group, then followed by the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade in April 1951. The 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade was the last to arrive and reinforce the area. The units were then all formed into the 1st Commonwealth Division. In October 1951, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) had made efforts to attack and take the hill at the First Battle of Maryang-san. PVA forces were pushed back and defeated by Australian forces.
Action.
The PVA first launched a large scale bombardment of the area, including rockets, on the night of 5 November. The barrage lasted 15 hours. The barrage was then followed up by a human wave attack of massed PVA troops, and the British were overrun. Some troops established a fighting withdrawal, and PVA troops captured the hill, taking British prisoners. The hill was defended by 400 British troops, but attacked by three battalions.
Private Bill Speakman was awarded Britain's Victoria Cross at this battle for his bravery. Speakman had been conveying a supply of grenades to the British troops, on the left hand side of the hill. When the PVA attacked, Speakman took it on his own initiative to gather 6 men, and then began throwing grenades at the PVA. He engaged the enemy with grenades and guns, making repeated charges against them in different directions. When the men ran out of grenades, they began throwing bottles and metal tea pots from the kitchen supply. This gave time for his unit to withdraw. Even while wounded in the leg, he continued to charge at the PVA.

Sergey Mayzel

Sergey Osipovich Mayzel (, , Saint-Petersburg ― 5 July 1955, Moscow) was a Soviet physicist and a specialist in the field of lighting engineering. He was Honored Worker of Science and Technology of the RSFSR (1944) and laureate of Stalin Prize of II degree (1946).
Biography.
Sergei Osipovich Mayzel was born on in St. Petersburg in the family of doctor Osip (Joseph) Isayevich Mayzel (1855–1913), a graduate of Imperial Medico-Surgical Academy of 1881. Sergey's mother, Sofya Efremovna Antik, died on December 25, 1882, 10 days after his birth, due to childbirth complications.
Mayzel was a Hereditary honorary citizen. In 1906 he graduated from St. Petersburg University and trained at the University of Göttingen in 1909. In 1906–1930 he worked as a mining engineer at the St. Petersburg Mining Institute. In 1908–1918 he simultaneously taught at Higher Women's Courses. Professor since 1911, he had the rank of Court councillor.
Since 1920, he worked part-time at the State Optical Institute. In 1930–1952 he worked in Moscow in the All-Union Electrotechnical Institute (since 1951 it was called Research Institute of Light Engineering, "VNISI"). In 1932 he began working at Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI) and directed its Lighting Engineering Department. He was Doctor of Technical Sciences (1938) and a member of the CPSU(b) since 1947.
Sergei Mayzel died on July 5, 1955 in Moscow.
Family.
Sergey Osipovich Mayzel had two sons:
Scientific work.
His main works are devoted to the physical basics of construction of light quantities, the basics of colorimetry, the problems of blackout, the methods of light measurements, the normalization of lighting for various types of work, and the development of new sources of light. He developed the theory of color vision. He participated in solving the issues of light coverage of the Hermitage, State Tretyakov Gallery, several Moscow Metro stations, Kremlin stars, Lenin Mausoleum, and various other objects. He presented critics of the definition of the luminous flux as the power of emanation estimated by visual sensation; the physical definition he proposed was internationally recognized. The new "equivalent brightness" value proposed by him for the estimation of small brightness photometry was included in the system of basic photometric magnitudes (1963), and then in the International Lighting Technical Dictionary. He wrote articles for magazines "Electricity", "Lighting Engineering" (and was a member of the editorial board). Overall Mayzel played a leading role in the creation of the Soviet lighting engineering school.

Banu Cennetoğlu

Banu Cennetoğlu (b. Ankara, 1970) is a visual artist based in Istanbul. She uses photography, installation, and printed matter to explore the classification, appropriation and distribution of data and knowledge. Her work deals with listings, collections, rearrangements, and archives. Cennetoğlu co-represented Turkey at the 53rd International Venice Biennale with Ahmet Öğüt in 2009. Her work has been shown at numerous international institutions such as Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna (2020); Ständehaus, Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfallen, Düsseldorf (2019); SculptureCenter, New York (2019); Liverpool Biennial, Liverpool (2018), Chisenhale Gallery, London (2018); documenta14, Athens and Kassel (2017); Bonner Kunstverein, Bonn (2015); Kunsthalle Basel, Basel (2011); Gwangju Biennale, Gwangju (2014), Manifesta 8, Murcia (2010); Walker Art Center (2007); Istanbul Biennial (2007); and Berlin Biennial (2003). She is the founding director of BAS (2006–ongoing), an Istanbul-based artist-run initiative that collects and displays artists’ books and printed material as artwork. In Turkey, she is "best known as an apostle of the artist’s book."
Education.
Cennetoğlu received a BA in psychology and then studied photography in Paris. From 1996 to 2002, she lived in New York where she worked on documentary and fashion photography for publications such as "Purple" and "Self Service". In 2002, she moved to Amsterdam where she studied a.o. at the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten and got involved with artists' books. In 2005, she moved back to Turkey. In 2016, she was a guest at the DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program.
Selected Works.
The List, 2007–ongoing.
Since 2007, Cennetoğlu has been developing "The" "List" in collaboration with UNITED for Intercultural Action, an Amsterdam-based network in support of migrants and refugees. The work is a collection of data about thousands of immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees who lost their lives on their way to or at the border of the European Union since 1993. It is presented in multiple forms, including posters, billboards, newspaper supplements, and public screens, in various cities, including Amsterdam, Athens, Basel, Istanbul, Sofia, Bonn, Milano, Los Angeles, Berlin, London, and Liverpool."The List" featured data about 7,128 individuals when first exhibited in Amsterdam in 2007. As of May 2018, it includes 34,361 cases. Cennetoğlu does not consider the project "an art piece"; she does not edition it, sell it or sign it. Although she doesn't consider this project an artwork, she acknowledges a connection between "The List" and her artistic practice, as her artworks deal with witness-bearing. This work exemplifies how Cennetoğlu assumes different positions such as caretaker and a facilitator—not only an author—when she deals with lists and archives. "Governments don’t keep these record for the public; they don’t want the public to see these records because it exposes their policies, so you have NGOs trying to put data together, and that data is incomplete and fragile, but there again someone has to do it. And I want to contribute to that with what I have and what I do—but not by aestheticizing it. You cannot represent this kind of darkness through art." The 2017 edition was distributed as an insert in "Tagesspiegel Berlin" edition. The 2018 edition was printed and distributed as a supplement by "The Guardian" in a print run of 210,000 on World Refugee Day, June 20, 2018. Subsequently, it was exhibited in the form of posters at Great George Street in Liverpool as part of the Liverpool Biennial 2018 and in conjunction with Cennetoğlu’s solo exhibition at Chisenhale Gallery, London. On August 1, 2018, the posters in Liverpool were anonymously destroyed and removed. Some suggested that a council worker may have mistaken the work as an illegal poster and taken it down, but a spokesperson from the city council refused the allegation. The work was reinstalled on August 5, 2018, but was vandalised again shortly afterwards.
Catalog 2009, 2009.
As part of "Lapses", the two-artist exhibition (with Ahmet Öğüt) curated by Başak Şenova for the Pavilion of Turkey at the 53rd International Venice Biennale, Cennetoğlu produced "CATALOG 2009" (2009), a book that mimics the format of a mail-order catalog, comprising 450 photographs organized in fifteen categories inspired by stock photography: composition, color, assumption, negotiation, operation, vanity, adjustment, excursion, caution, love, seizure, exploit, act, invasion and replacement. Cennetoğlu created subjective categories to organize her photographs along with a few found photographs, challenging the assumed hierarchies of value. For the duration of the exhibition in Venice, the viewers were encouraged to order and download the featured photographs from the Internet free or charge.
04.09.2014, 2014.
In the early 2010s, Cennetoğlu started creating bound collections of daily newspapers printed in one day and has produced different editions of this work in several countries, including Turkey, Switzerland, and Germany. The work offers a juxtaposition of information in an unconventional way, and questions the politics of representation through print media. The artist calls it a "re-contextualization" of the newspaper and "an almost monumentalization" as the archiving of printed matter is meant to be temporary.
Gurbet's Diary, 2017.
Commissioned by documenta14, "Gurbet’s Diary" is a work that comprises 82,661 words in mirror image placed on 145 press-ready lithographic limestone slabs. It draws from "Gurbet's Diary. I Engraved My Heart into the Mountains" by Gurbetelli Ersöz, first published in 1998 by Mezopotamien Verlag, Neuss. Ersöz was a chemist turned editor turned guerrilla—a Kurdish fighter who kept a journal as an act of resistance between 1995–97. In her diary, she writes about her experience as a fighter as well as her observations in nature, poetry she likes, and the difference between being an intellectual and a fighter. She was killed in 1997. As part of the exhibition in Kassel, Cennetoğlu also created a related work, replacing the usual inscription of "Museum Fridericianum" with "Being safe is scary"—as a tribute to Ersöz.
1 January 1970 – 21 March 2018 · H O W B E I T · Guilty feet have got no rhythm · Keçiboynuzu · AS IS · MurMur · I measure every grief I meet · Taq u Raq · A piercing Comfort it affords · Stitch · Made in Fall · Yes. But. We had a golden heart. · One day soon I’m gonna tell the moon about the crying game, 2018.
Cennetoğlu's most recent work is a 128 hours and 22 minutes long film work that comprises an unedited archive of all the digital images the artist has amassed between June 2006 and March 2018. The film features all the photographs and videos the artist took, the images she received on his phone and email, all of her video works, their documentation, exhibitions, as well as images from her private life. Considered as an act of "vulnerability and rebelliousness", the work is an investigation of collective histories through the images the artist has collected over 12 years. The title was inspired by Clarice Lispector's The Hour of the Star, a novel with thirteen subtitles separated by or's.
Exhibitions.
Selected group exhibitions include Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna (2020); Ständehaus, Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfallen, Düsseldorf (2019); Liverpool Biennial, Liverpool (2018); "Stories of Almost Everyone," Hammer Museum, Los Angeles (2018); "3rd Berlin Herbstsalon," Maxim Gorki Theater, Berlin (2017); documenta14, Athens and Kassel (2017); "It is Obvious from the Map", Redcat, Los Angeles (2017); "The Restless Earth", Fondazione Nicola Trussardi, Milan (2017); "… und eine Welt noch", Kunsthaus Hamburg, Hamburg (2016); "Burning Down The House", 10th Gwangju Bienniale, Gwangju (2014); "Frozen Lakes", Artist’s Space, New York (2013); Manifesta 8, Murcia (2010); The Pavilion of Turkey at the 53rd Venice Biennale (2009); 3rd Berlin Biennale (2008); 1st Athens Biennale (2007); and 10th Istanbul Biennale (2007).
The artist is represented by Rodeo Gallery, based in London and Piraeus.
Artist-run initiative.
In 2006, Cennetoğlu initiated an artist-run project called BAS, which roughly translates as "print". The space currently hosts a collection of artists' books and ephemera on permanent display, which has grown from her own collection. The collection comprises three main categories: artists' publications, periodicals, and project publications with an online inventory. The artists' books in the collection are produced in large editions and circulate outside of mainstream art channels. This can be considered as an extension of her artistic research on the collection, organization, and dissemination of information.
Alongside BAS, Cennetoğlu collaborated with artist Philippine Hoegen to establish Bent, the publishing project that focused on commissioning artists' books by artists from Turkey. The first publication was "Pavement Myth-The Life of the Pavement’s Wolf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)" by Masist Gül, followed by artists' books "Takip/Poursuite" (2006) by Aslı Çavuşoğlu, "Bent003" by Emre Hüner, "Sahil Sahnesi Sesi" (2008) Cevdet Erek, "KILAVUZ" (2009) by the artist collective Atılkunst, among others.
BAS also hosted exhibitions, including "Masist Gül" (2011); "Artists' books from Georgia and BAS Collection" (2011); "KORIDOR 1988–1995" (2010); "Artists' books by Sol LeWitt" (2009), and more.
To develop the BAS Collection, Cennetoğlu prioritizes diversity over personal taste as she has an open acquisition policy when buying, accepting, and bartering artists' books. The collection is open to the public.
In 2014, collectorspace, an Istanbul-based nonprofit, collaborated with Cennetoğlu and the BAS Collection to work on an exhibition with a newspaper project borrowed from the collection, titled "Corrections and Clarifications" (2001–ongoing) by artist Anita Di Bianco.

Group 2000

Group 2000 () was a Dutch resistance group during the Second World War in the Amsterdam area and remained virtually unknown for 70 years. The Group was founded in 1940 and was led by Ms. Jacoba van Tongeren during the entire war. For the duration of the Second World War she provided food coupons for around 4,500 people in hiding. Group 2000 had more than 140 members who, together with the people in hiding, remained invisible during the war, and also afterwards, through the use of 4-number codenames. This changed only in 2015, after the book ‘Jacoba van Tongeren and the unknown resistance heroes of Group 200’ was published.
Origin.
The founder of Group 2000, Jacoba van Tongeren, was an ecclesiastical social worker of the Dutch Reformed Church. Born in 1903, she was educated since her childhood in discipline and secrecy by her father Hermannus van Tongeren, a high officer in the Dutch colonial army (KNIL). Immediately after the capitulation in May 1940 he involved her in his first resistance activities. At the same time she was approached by the co-founders of the illegal magazine Vrij Nederland, Jan van der Neut and Frans Hofker. They started setting up the resistance newspaper, supported materially and financially by Hermannus van Tongeren, who also helped with the contacts of the Freemasons. At the request of the Reformed Church, Jacoba van Tongeren became social worker in charge of maintaining contact with the resistance. Her contact with the Amsterdam Church Council was Dr. Bernard Aris. Through her position she could travel freely through the country and she laid a nationwide network of contacts. This led to the resistance group becoming a national network from the beginning.
In the Spring of 1941, dozens of members from, among others, Vrij Nederland were arrested. ‘Free the Netherlands’ and the resistance group split up and went their own way. Free the Netherlands as resistance newspaper Vrij Nederland and Group 2000 through helping people in hiding. Jacoba van Tongeren herself also went into hiding and came to the conclusion that all members of the Group should know as little as possible about each other and that the Group should no longer use real names, as her father always had held up. Based on what her father had taught her about intelligence years before, she developed a code system. From now on, every Group 2000 member was only referred to by a code number. This coding is the reason that during the entire World War II the group and all 4500 people in hiding were never unmasked. In March 1945, the Germans occupied the Group's headquarters and found thousands of coded names and addresses. However, they could not crack the code and the resistance fighters and people in hiding remained safe. Due to the code, members were anonymous during the war, but also afterwards: no one knew who was who.
Group activities and departments.
The management of Group 2000 was formed by the Management Committee consisting of Ab Abas, Frits van Meer and Jacoba van Tongeren as executive manager. The Daily Board existed in 1944 of Harry Mouthaan, Kees Reitema and Jacoba van Tongeren. Each member was given his own task according to his position and was only accountable to Jacoba van Tongeren.
In mid-1941, the Group was formed to help the growing number of people in hiding: Jews hiding in order to escape deportation, people who opposed the persecution of the Jews and the German domination, and men who evaded forced labor in Germany. For these people, hiding places had to be found every month. For this, use was made of the large ecclesiastical network that Jacoba had set up and the many contacts with the Freemasons.
For all people in hiding, food coupons were needed, which were obtained in various ways: at the distribution offices themselves and by robbery at distribution offices. A brigadier of police managed the food coupons depot and used his position to acquire extra coupons. Several others took care of the distribution of the coupons, bringing them to Amsterdam areas. Part of the transport of these coupons were taken care of by Jacoba van Tongeren. She had a special ‘coupon vest’ in which 5,000 coupons could be transported, which gave her the title 'The Queen of Coupons' (De Bonnenkoninging). Others still brought food packages to the Jews in the prisoner camps of Vught, Westerbork, Bergen-Belsen, or to persons in hiding. Among them is Truus Wijsmuller, who personally arranged to help 600 Jewish children escape Austria in 1938, and 500 of them continuing their journey to England.
People in hiding also needed identification cards, and another department of Group 2000 provided these. They managed the registration of those in need of IDs, the production, distribution. One member, Gerrit Jan van der Veen, known by his code name ‘2200’, later controlled the Personal Identity Center that created about 80,000 identity cards.
In addition, the Group organized many more activities to carry out the resistance work. Crucial tasks were the so-called ‘district-work’, the Red Cross department, and providing security. The district-work took care of the delicate and efficient communication and coupon distribution from centralised places to local neighbourhoods. The local Red Cross department was led by one doctor, the first aid and medical care by another one, and there were 16 more doctors and nurses involved. The Group counted a dozen couriers, as well as drivers for food transport. Security was the responsibility of guards, who overlooked hauling of food and goods, and provided 24/7 security at food depots. A combat team of about 10 members was responsible for more proactive, armed resistance. Group 2000 also secured a place for the Marine Transmission Station, an important strategic asset to receive messages from England and distribute the news all over the Netherlands. Ministers offered spiritual and moral support to the resistance fighters and people in hiding.
Group 2000 was represented at the highest level of the resistance: the national Council of Resistance. The activities cost more and more money. Hermannus van Tongeren already provided a large sum in 1940 from the Freemasons. Isaac Troostwijk continued this support in the middle of 1942. Of these 600,000 guilders (the equivalent of about 4 million euros in 2015), Group 2000 funded many of its own activities, and provided substantial start-up subsidies for other organisations like Vrij Nederland, the Personal Identity Center and the National Support Fund.
The Group and its members.
The Group was supported by the Order of Freemasons, and counted about ten Freemasons among its members. Another supporter was the Dutch Reformed Church. A lot of members belonged to this church, and of more than ten ministers in the Group, most were Reformed. There were ten Jewish members. More than ten members and employees had made great efforts to aid Jewish people in hiding and later received the Yad Vashem medal. The Group counted men and women of all ages, roughly in the proportion of men:women as 5:3. One finds a great diversity of professions: from fur trimster and glass blower to banker and sculptor. Many of the Group members practiced their profession during the war, visible to the occupier. But in the meantime they performed invisible resistance work. By the end of the war, 18 Group members were murdered by the Nazis.
Relative obscurity of Group 2000.
There are several reasons why the group remained unknown to all except a few during the war and for 70 years after 1945. The most important reason is the secret code by which all members were known. The extense of the network and the individual identities of members were beyond the grasp of all those who were involved, except Jacoba van Tongeren and one assistant, the only ones who assigned and knew code names. The code proved extremely effective and useful during the war. It was also the reason that the group was not very visible after the war. The name “Group 2000” itself contributed further to this invisibility.
Another reason is that Dutch historians who wrote about the Second World War considered ‘resistance’ to be primarily those activities that actively fought against the German occupiers and that disadvantaged them. Espionage, sabotage and fighting groups were considered to be part of that endeavour, but helping persons in hiding was not. The deeds of heroic, tough men was extensively documented, but much less so the work of female resistance fighters, who were messengers or did various other tasks like those of Group 2000. The role of women in resistance remained underexposed.
Finally, the leader, Jacoba van Tongeren herself, was very modest and did not boast about the Group’s efforts during the war. In 1945, she only delivered a rather formal, factual report to the Dutch queen's consort, also General and supreme commander of the army, Prince Bernard of Lippe-Biesterfeld. What made things worse, is that van Tongeren became chronically ill and was tied to her bed during many of the remaining years of her life. Shortly before she died, in 1967, she wrote an extensive, deeply personal account of her ‘Memories’ to a pastor of a national radio station. But her report was filed and discovered only in 2013 by her cousin Paul van Tongeren. Quoting extensively from Jacoba’s ‘Memories’, he and Trudy Admiraal wrote the book ‘Jacoba van Tongeren en de onbekende verzetshelden van Groep 2000’, which appeared in 2015. For 70 years the Group had remained invisible. The publication lifted the veil of obscurity for the descendants of many Group members, who often knew only bits and pieces of the full story of their (great)grandfathers and – mothers, and for others who had an as yet incomplete picture of resistance in Amsterdam and many other parts of The Netherlands from 1940 to 1945.

The revealed God

The Revealed God (Latin: deus revelatus) in Christian theology is a term coined by Martin Luther which affirms that the ultimate self-revelation of God is in his hiddenness.  It is the particular focus of Luther’s work the Heidelberg Theses of 1518, presented during the Heidelberg disputation of 1518.  In Christian theology, God is presented as revealed or "‘deus revelatus’" through the suffering of Jesus Christ on the cross.  Debate of the term is found in the field of ‘Philosophy of Religion,’ where it is contested among philosophers such as J. L. Schellenberg.  The term is usually distinguished from Luther’s concept of ‘The Hidden God’ or "‘deus absconditus’" which proposes that God actively hides. It is accepted that God is invisible, however Luther posed God as an actively hiding who can use this hiding to reveal himself. This distinction which permeates his theology has been the subject of wide interpretation, leading to controversy between theologians who believe the terms to be either antithetical or identical.  These two conflicting strands of thought present the main problem when interpreting Luther’s doctrine of the Revealed God.  In recent years the term has been used to inform modern analysis of religious themes such as evolution.
The Revealed God.
Christian Theology.
The conception of Luther's Revealed God came about through his own personal struggles with grasping assurance of God's grace, which he confirmed by looking to the Cross of Christ. The concept of the incomprehensibility of God was first introduced by Luther in his "Lectures on The Psalms".  The theology of ‘"deus revelatus"’ originated to address the concern that if a God exists, he has not made his existence sufficiently clear.  The term ‘Revealed God’ can be found in Luther’s works, "Heidelberg Theses" (1518) and "On the Bondage of the Will" (1525).  Luther’s theology was permeated by the theology of the cross, which led to the conception of both the Revealed God ("deus revelatus") and the hidden God ("deus absconditus").  In the "Heidelberg Thesis," Luther asserts the view of "‘deus revelatus"', a living God who suffered on a cross, and in "On the Bondage of the Will" Luther depicts the "‘deus absconditus’," a God of hidden majesty. The Christian concept of God depicts an absolute being who is righteous in himself, thereby becoming a threat to unrighteous humans. Therefore, He must become 'the God who seeks to be justified by the unrighteous in his words, a great vulnerability in which God stoops low in order to give sinners faith'.
The concept of the Revealed God was later referred to by Paulson as 'The Preached God'. The Revealed God is one being and three persons who 'actively wants to be found—in Christ, and him crucified—justified in his words'. Luther thus proposed that God’s ultimate self revelation is in hiddenness, ‘namely, in weakness, in folly, in the incarnation and on the cross’.  The divine majesty and glory of God is ‘shame and humiliation’ as he ‘brings life by means of death, whose suffering leads to resurrection’, thus there becomes a paradox whereby God is hidden in His self-revelation.  God is hidden ‘in the suffering, humility and shame of the cross’ and ones suffering on Earth, however through faith sinners can recognise the God of love and mercy revealed in Christ. Such a revelation which leads to justification nevertheless requires a preacher, thus 'The Holy Spirit sends such preachers so that grace is not so deeply hidden that we never find Christ hidden in the repulsive cross'. Because of this, Luther’s theology states that any individual outside of a Christian community of faith do not experience his self-revelation and do not know his attitude towards them.
Luther believed that the visible aspects of God through his hiding were the only sufficient explanation of God.  Therefore, Luther stated it was imperative that theologians focus on the cross to ‘see God as God wants to be seen’. ‘Those who seek to know the invisible things of God, namely, God's glory, majesty, wisdom, and justice, through the wisdom of natural revelation are chastised as theologians of glory by Luther’.
The concept connects to free will within Christian theology as it leads to the belief that ‘God must remain hidden […] failing to do so would lead to a loss of morally significant freedom on the part of creatures’.
In the Bible.
Luther’s conception of the Revealed God was derived from specific scripture in the Christian bible which detail how only through Christ does God choose to be revealed.  Passages of significance include John 14:8-9, ‘8 Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.” 9 Jesus answered: “Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?’. 
Philosophy of religion.
The Revealed God contributes to debate in Philosophy of Religion whereby philosophers such as J. L. Schellenberg have used it to support the view of atheism.
Schellenberg’s line of argument attempts to disprove the Judeo-Christian God by stating that were there a perfectly loving God, He would adequately reveal Himself to allow every person to attain personal relationship with Him.  However, since ‘there are capable, inculpable non-believers […] there is no perfectly loving God’.  
Schellenberg’s Argument:
Similar: 'The Hidden God'.
A similar Lutheran concept is that of the Hidden God, a deity whose grace is hidden, which is often considered to be interconnected to the Revealed God.  Luther’s depiction of ‘"deus absconditus’" can be found in his work Bondage of the Will (De servo arbitrio). Luther’s concept asserts that the first instance of hiding in the Christian Bible occurred in the garden of Eden where Adam and Eve sought to hide from God. Following this instance, God has remained hidden in the sense that his will and counsels remain unknown to any except him.
There are two contrasting views of the implications of Luther's depiction of a Hidden God:
Controversy.
A prevalent issue in theological scholarship is the relationship between the Revealed God and the Hidden God.  Controversy has arisen as to whether the ‘"deus revelatus’" and ‘"deus absconditus’" refer to two distinct strands of theology which only have the concept of hiddenness in common, or are identical in form.  It is claimed that according to his own writings, 'Luther never preached two or three gods or powers; he was not a Manichaean or anti-Trinitarian', however a seeming paradox is contested. Gerrish forms two differing groups of theologians dependent on whether they believe the terms are antithetical or identical.  
Theologians who believe the terms are antithetical include Hendel, Theodosius Harnack, the two Ritschls, Reinhold Seeberg, Hirsch, Elert, and Holl.  Such theologians argue the dualistic nature of the terms and state that the two differing views of God they produce cannot be reconciled.  Hendel states ‘Luther warns that the theologian and believer must distinguish between the God preached, or revealed, and the God hidden, "that is, between the Word of God and God himself”’.  Harnack’s work was considered to be a rediscovering of the concept of the Hidden and Revealed God whereby ‘the notion of hiddenness expresses a double relation of God to the world: outside of Christ he is the free, all-working, majestic God of the Law; in Christ he is the gracious Redeemer who has bound himself to his Word and Sacraments’. This position was also held by Althaus who stated that through his conception of the Revealed and Hidden God, Luther divided God; 'God, according to His secret will, to a great extent disagrees with His Word offering grace to all men'.
Theologians who believe the terms are identical are Kattenbusch and Erich Seeberg.  The theologians argue that a single event of revelation led people through faith to see the Revealed God, and through simply sense-perception see the Hidden God.  Kattenbusch perpetuated the standpoint of the two terms as identical, asserting that ‘God hides himself in his revelation, so that revelation and hiddenness are not opposed, but coincide’.
Modern Theological Application.
Luther’s theology has remained relevant in a multitude of modern theological debates such as evolutionary debate.  
Evolutionary Debate.
Theologian Charlene Burns has examined meaning of violent evolution with regards to Christian theology.  Scientific discoveries continue to uncover violence as a marker of the origin of the world, from the ‘movement of fault lines in the earth to the extinction of species’.  Burns uses a phenomenological approach to discuss the violence which is inherent to evolution.  Burns states that ‘God is revealed not in the suffering of Christ on the cross, per se, but in what that suffering stimulates’, and states that evolution has led to humanity becoming ‘destroyers’.  Burns concludes by asserting that the idea of God being revealed through the suffering of Christ exemplifies the altruistic nature of God, which humanity is called to emulate in its current advanced stage of evolution.

Attack on St Alberts School

The Attack on St Alberts School was an attack carried out on the Catholic mission high school, which is in Mashonaland Central province of Rhodesia overlooking the Zambezi Valley in east of the country close to the border with Mozambique. The attack was carried out by the ZANLA. 
Background.
Saint Alberts High School is a coeducational Roman Catholic Church mission high school that also provides boarding for students. It is situated in the Mashonaland Central province of Rhodesia, on the escarpment overlooking the Zambezi Valley in northern Zimbabwe near the Mozambique border. It is above this escarpment which is also popularly known as the Mavhuradonha Mountain range. The Valley below is also known as Dande. St. Alberts is located in a pristine area between Mount Darwin and Centenary, in a region of temperate weather.
The Attack.
In July 1973, Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) cadres captured 292 pupils and staff from the school and force-marched them north towards Mozambique, where the ZANLA bases were. The march was intercepted by the Rhodesian Security Forces before the cadres crossed the border, and all but eight of the children and staff were recovered.
Similar abductions were repeated over the following years and the security forces found themselves increasingly unable to prevent them. The captured schoolchildren would be marched to ZANLA bases in Mozambique where they would undergo "political 're-education'" (Abbott's and Botham's words) and guerrilla training.
The school was closed in the late 1970s at the height of the Rhodesian Bush War. It had become a haven for the recruitment of communist backed terrorists.

Black Velvet is an album by American jazz guitarist O'Donel Levy recorded in 1971 and released on the Groove Merchant label.
Reception.
Allmusic's Jason Ankeny said: ""Black Velvet" boasts a smooth, rich texture absent from O'Donel Levy's subsequent Groove Merchant sessions – its mellow, stoned-soul sensibilities nevertheless complement the guitarist perfectly, affording him the space to weave a series of righteously beautiful solos ...the arrangements are lovely ... Levy also proves himself a composer of some distinction, contributing a pair of charming originals".

Louise Home Hospital and Residence Hall

The Louise Home Hospital and Residence Hall is an historic hospital and residence hall in Gresham, Oregon, United States. Built in 1925, it originally served as a place of residence for unwed and pregnant mothers. It also housed the disabled, and served as a women's educational institution. The hospital and its surrounding campus—surrounded by Douglas fir trees—is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
Contemporarily, it is the headquarters of the Albertina Kerr Centers for Children, a mental health institution in the Portland metropolitan area.
History.
The original Louise Home was established in the Goose Hollow neighborhood of Portland, Oregon by William G. McLaren, who wanted to create awareness for unwed mothers. The home is believed to have taken its name from the house's first donor, or that of the sellers of the original home. The organization was run by Albertina Kerr. Kerr died of typhus in 1911, after which her husband Alexander donated the home to the Pacific Coast Rescue and Protective Society. 
The Louise Home Hospital and Residence Hall was built in 1925 on a plot of land in Gresham due to an increased need for boarding and medical care for unwed pregnant women, single mothers, and children. The Louise Home was the center of the campus, housing unwed young women, though additional buildings served as the Albertina Kerr Nursery and the Wynne Watts School, an educational institute for women. The Louise Home had its own self-sustaining farm that provided meat, dairy products, eggs, fruit, and vegetables for the residents.

Fever 333

Fever 333 or the Fever 333 (both stylized in all caps) is an American rock band formed in Inglewood, California, United States, in July 2017. The three-piece band consists of former Letlive vocalist Jason Aalon Butler, former the Chariot guitarist Stephen Harrison and Night Verses drummer Aric Improta.
The band's debut extended play (EP), "Made an America", was released on March 23, 2018. The group is signed to Roadrunner Records and 333 Wreckords. Their first LP "Strength in Numb333rs" was released a year later and its second EP "Wrong Generation" was released in 2020.
Career.
2017–present: Formation, "Made an America" and "Strength in Numb333rs".
Prior to the disbandment of Letlive, Jason Aalon Butler had met Travis Barker by chance, and decided to spend Super Bowl Sunday with him and John Feldmann. The trio spent the day discussing hip hop and afro-punk, which developed into building a concept together of what Butler described as "something a little dangerous that was subservice: musically and in ethos". By the time Letlive had broken up, Butler got in contact with Stephen Harrison, whose band the Chariot had disbanded a few years prior. Butler and Harrison discussed black people's participation in rock music and the concept for a band that Butler had previously dreamed up.
Fever 333 performed an impromptu pop-up show in a U-Haul truck in the parking lot of the bakery Randy's Donuts in Inglewood, California on July 4, 2017. The band performed three brand new unreleased tracks. Fever 333 members Jason Aalon Butler, Stephen Harrison, and Aric Improta hinted at the musical project and the show days prior to the midday performance. Butler posted a statement upon the announcement of the formation of Fever 333 in an Instagram post. "To those of you who want change, here is an offering to start that conversation. I've had a lot of people asking me what I'll be doing in the future—here is a taste of that." Butler continued, "I love art. I love being a musician. I love progress. And I am no stranger to pushing back if I feel it is necessary. This will be an exhibition of all the things I love w/ like minded people for whom I care deeply. To all the tired, frustrated, and brave, come join us." The band released its debut single, "We're Coming In", accompanied by a music video, which premiered on "Alternative Press" on August 25, 2017. On August 29, the band released another track, titled "Hunting Season", which features an uncredited guest appearance from Travis Barker. At the band's first headlining club show on August 31, 2017, and second concert overall, Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker made a surprise appearance performing on the song "Hunting Season" at The Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood. On November 3, 2017, the band released the song "Walking in My Shoes".
On March 23, 2018, Fever 333 released their debut extended play (EP), "Made an America", without any prior announcement, on Roadrunner Records. Nathan Pike, Harrison's stepbrother and manager of 333 Wreckords, assisted with the US marketing efforts of the EP. On May 23, 2018, the band released a stand-alone single, "Trigger", regarding the topic of gun violence in the United States, accompanied by its music video. On September 28, 2018, the band released an official remix to their song "Made an America", featuring Barker and rapper Vic Mensa. A music video for the remix was also released on the band's official YouTube channel. Directed by Brandon Dermer, the black and white video sees vocalist Jason Butler performing in a warehouse, where he is joined by Mensa and Barker. In November 2018, the band was confirmed to serve as main support to Bring Me the Horizon on their United Kingdom and European arena tour later in the year.
On November 9, 2018, the band released the single "Burn It" along with announcing details of their debut album, "Strength in Numb333rs", which was released on January 18, 2019. On December 7, 2018, the band received a Grammy nomination in Best Rock Performance for "Made an America". On May 29, 2019, they were featured on the song "Scary Mask", a single by Poppy. Its accompanying music video was directed by Titanic Sinclair. On November 3, 2019, the band released a new song called "Kingdom" on BBC Radio 1's Rock Show hosted by Daniel P. Carter. The song was released to stream the next day. On December 6, 2019, "Blow me", a single by The Used featuring the vocalist of Fever 333 Jason Aalon Butler is published.
Following the May 25, 2020 murder of George Floyd, the band released "Long Live the Innocent" on June 3, a live political demonstration and musical performance. Proceeds were donated to the Minnesota Freedom Fund and Black Lives Matter. During the performance they debuted the unreleased song "Supremacy", which was officially released on June 8.
Fever 333 released the single "Bite Back" on October 19, 2020. On October 23, 2020, Fever 333 released their second EP titled, "Wrong Generation".
Musical style.
Their music merges elements of punk rock and hip hop, which Butler has described as both being "rooted in subversion", citing musical influences such as Rage Against the Machine, Public Enemy and Black Flag. Their lyrics tackle politically and socially conscious themes such as racism, sexism and homophobia. Their music has been categorised as rap rock, rapcore, rap metal, and hardcore punk. Some of their songs also feature elements of trap music, and subsequently been categorised as trap metal. In article for Afropunk Festival's website, Butler stated that he believes "Punk rock and hip-hop are one-in-the-same. They’re always flying the flag of channeling art from discord", echoing a similar sentiment in an article for Colorado Springs Independent, by saying "[Fever 333's music is] like the evolution of guitar-based music. Because currently, hip-hop is really pushing the envelope sonically, as well as ideologically".
In a 2019 article for Kerrang!, writer Mischa Pearlman described their music as "a thrilling combination of post-hardcore and hip-hop with some of the catchiest melodies you’ll hear on any album from this year". In an article for Altcorner.com, writer Elizabeth Birt described them as "a riotous punk act... [that] have solidified a sturdy brand of protest punk as they take aim at the wrongs in the world but particularly in their homeland of America, not through violence but through angst-filled lyrics".
Political views and activism.
The band espouse radical left-wing political views, in opposition to social inequality, capitalism and authoritarianism in both their lyrics and activism. The "333" in their name represents the three core principles that the members view the band to stand for: community, charity and change. In 2019 interview for Guestlist.net, Butler stated:
They are heavily inspired by the anti-racist, anti-imperialist and anti-fascist views of the Black Panther Party in addition to political activists such as Mahatma Gandhi, Angela Davis, James Baldwin and Ta-Nehisi Coates. In a 2019 interview for Kerrang!, Butler stated that they perceive that "[they are] speaking with the people, not for them".
They have also expressed disdain for the American electoral system, with Butler specifically stating that he doesn't believe the majority of politicians to stand for the betterment of the people in general, with voters generally only considered the effects their vote would have on themselves and disregarding those often less fortunate than them.
The group perceive their status as a band provides them with a platform to support to project their views to a wider audience and combat social injustice, citing that they are "trying to write the soundtrack to the revolution that we know is about to happen". In an article for Kerrang!, Butler said that:
"Long Live the Innocent".
"Long Live the Innocent" was a live streamed demonstration and performance by the band on June 3, 2020. It was a response to the murder of George Floyd by police on May 25 of the same year and represented the band's condemnation of both his specific killers, as well as police brutality and institutional racism in general. All proceeds were donated to the Minnesota Freedom Fund and Black Lives Matter. NME described the event a representation of solidarity with the communities also protesting Floyd's death. In one speech that Butler gave during the event, he stated that:
Butler also criticised a number of high profile record labels and streaming services, including Atlantic Records, Sony Music, Spotify, Def Jam Recordings, Amazon and Apple Music, for not using their money to support the black community during this time, despite profiting off of black culture and music.
Imagery.
The band's logo is a homage to the logo of the Black Panther Party, an American anti-racism and revolutionary socialist organisation that Butler has likened the band's practices to, as "black panthers do not strike unless they are pushed into a corner to where they have no way out". The homage was approved by the designer of the Black Panther's logo and their Minister of Culture Emory Douglas.
While performing live, Butler often wears a bulletproof vest with "333" across its chest. According to an article by Kerrang!, this is intended to present the American police force's increasing militarisation. Butler also often performs in a boilersuit, also featuring the groups iconography, along with a bag over his head, representing the human rights abuses in prisons such as Guantanamo Bay detention camp and Abu Ghraib prison.

Mundic Creek extends from the Murray River channel in the west to the Sturt Highway on higher ground in the east over a floodplain known in one source as the "Pike River Basin" and in another as the "Pike Floodplain" and which it shares with the localities of Paringa in the north and Pike River in the south. Most of the floodplain located in what is now the locality was flooded by the 1956 Murray River flood and those parts existing as permanent water bodies are part of the nationally important wetland known as the "Pike-Mundic Wetland Complex".
Land use within Mundic Creek and adjoining localities consists of ‘primary production’ activities such as agriculture, fishing, irrigation and sand mining, recreation activities concerned with watercraft, fishing and hunting, residential use, and nature conservation as represented by the Pike River Conservation Park. Land in the majority of the locality is either zoned as the ‘River Murray Flood Zone’ or the ‘River Murray Fringe Zone’ which makes it subject to statutory control for the purposes of “conservation and improvement of water quality” as per the "River Murray Act 2003".
The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Mundic Creek had a population of 34 people.
Mundic Creek is located within the federal division of Barker, the state electoral district of Chaffey and the local government area of the Renmark Paringa Council.

Military Band of the National Guard of Georgia

The Military Band of the National Guard of Georgia () is the main military band of the National Guard of Georgia, and the senior state military band of the Defense Forces of Georgia (known as the Georgian Armed Forces until December 2018).
History.
The history of the orchestra dates back to 1917 when musician Valerian Mizandar assembled 65 musicians in the ninth horse riding range of the Georgian Cadet Corps and created a large military brass orchestra, which had never been before. In 1918, after the declaration of independence of Georgia, it was called the People's Guards Band. It was abolished during the Soviet era and was replaced with the massed military bands of the Transcaucasian Military District. The Military Band of the National Guard of Georgia was created in 1991 with the establishment of the Georgian Armed Forces on the basis of the People's Guard Band and the HQ Band of the Transcaucasian Military District, whose personnel were absorbed by the new formation. In the beginning, its repertoire only consisted of national anthems, and military marches. Nowadays, the orchestra performs music that includes classical and contemporary music. It has participated in many international military music festivals, such as the Military Band's Festival in Riga, Latvia, the Festival of Military Bands in Muscat, Oman, the International Music Festival “Autumn Tbilisi”, and the Black Sea Jazz Festival in Batumi.
In February 2016, the Defence Ministry of Georgia announced a competition to submit the best pieces of military music to be performed by the orchestra on Georgia's Independence Day on May 26.
In June 2017, the band performed with The Salamanca Band of the Rifles of the United Kingdom during its tour of the region. On June 20, "Tbiliso", which is the unofficial anthem of the City of Tbilisi, was performed by both bands. They also performed together on June 26, during a concert on a bridge in the neighborhood of Metekhi.

Alfons Rissberger

Alfons Rissberger (born May 25, 1948 in Worms) is a German entrepreneur, business consultant, and author.
Life.
Rissberger was born in Worms, Germany, in 1948. His father was a locksmith.
He studied an apprenticeship in television technology-craftsmanship, followed by further study in Frankfurt and Darmstadt in electrical engineering, computer sciences, and vocational education. He focused on educational psychology and political sciences. He holds a diploma in engineering and completed the first and second state examinations in vocational education.
He financed his studies by working as a night cargo workman at Frankfurt Airport and by setting up informatics-course-systems at community colleges in Frankfurt-Höchst and Worms. The concept of these informatics-courses was the foundation for recommendations by the Gesellschaft für Informatik ("German Informatics Society") and by the Deutsche Volkshochschul-Verband e.V. ("German Community College Union") for vocational education.
He has been married twice and has two children with his first wife.
From 1970 until 1991 he taught and led activities in colleges. He also provided advanced training to executive managers in businesses. As a college professor, his focus was applied informatics, though he also taught informatics, trade, foreign business, taxation, and tourism at the University of Applied Sciences of the state Rhineland-Palatinate, Worms. He lectured for ten years at the BASF-Führungskolleg at the University Seminary of Economy in the water castle Gracht in Liblar near Cologne.
Since 1974 Rissberg has been a political and economical consultant with an emphasis on success and efficiency in the IT-age. He is a surveyor at the Enquete-Komission "Deutschlands Weg in die Informationsgesellschaft" (Enquete-Commission Germany's path to an information society) of the German Bundestag, a member of the science advisory council of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a chairman of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern multimedia advisory council, a leader of e-learning research projects, and an author of textbooks, television, and video productions.
From 1985 to 1993 Rissberger was the head of the department for new information and communication technologies at the Ministry of Education, Science and Advanced Training Rheinland-Pfalz, Mainz. He was responsible for the introduction of IT basic education in secondary education in all public schools within the state. He is also the editor of the first German IT basic education schoolbook published by Klett-Verlag. Rissberger was a leader of a number of German and European first-time BLK-model-experiments in e-learning. He generated ideas for new school formats (such as the technical collage for informatics) and new vocational training areas.
In 1987 he was the first German scientist who was responsible for a model experiment by the Federal State Commission for education management and research support (BLK) which studied e-learning at an elementary school. From 1985 to 1993 Rissberger was responsible for IT basic education (ITG) and e-learning in the Rhineland-Palatinate's education system. 
From 1993 until 2005 he was the managing director of DVZ Datenverarbeitungszentrums Mecklenburg-Vorpommern GmbH (data processing center). Since that time he owns the business Rissberger Strategie Consulting in Hamburg and Schwerin.
In 1994, he founded the Berlin memorandum (lit. "Active Learning: Multimedia for a Better Education).
In 1999, he was a founding board member of Initiative D21 with chancellor Gerhard Schröder as chairman of the advisory council.
Rissberger was the founder and managing director of DVZ Consulting GmbH in Schwerin.
In 2001 Rissberger demanded a focused national project "e-learning in the German-speaking educational system" with a concept for the first virtual University in Germany: "VirtuS- Virtual University Schwerin", but the project was never completed.
He has owned Rissberger Strategie Consulting in Hamburg and Schwerin since 2006.
In 2007, he started and co-edited the Berlin memorandum (lit. "VirtusD Virtual University Germany – e-learning for a Better Education at Universities").

Metallacyclopentanes

In organometallic chemistry, metallacyclopentanes are compounds with the formula LnM(CH2)4 (Ln = ligands, and M = metal). They are a type of metallacycle. Metallacyclopentanes are intermediates in some metal-catalysed reactions in homogeneous catalysis.
Synthesis and structure.
Traditionally, metallacyclopentanes are prepared by dialkylation of metal dihalides with 1,4‐bis(bromomagnesio)butane or the related dilithio reagent. The complex Ni(bipyridine)C4H8 is prepared by oxidative addition of 1,4-dibromobutane to Ni(0) precursors. Metallacyclopentanes also arise via the dimerization of ethylene within the coordination sphere of a low-valence metal center. This reaction is relevant to the catalytic production of butenes and related alkenes.
Occurrence.
Early examples of metallacyclopentanes come from studies of the Ni-catalyzed linear- and cyclo-dimerization of ethylenes. Linear dimerization proceeds via beta-hydride elimination of the nickelacyclopentane (Ph3P)Ni(CH2)4 whereas cyclodimerization to give cyclobutane proceeds by reductive elimination from the related (Ph3P)2Ni(CH2)4. Another example of a metallacyclopentane is the titanocene derivative Cp2Ti(CH2)4.
Metallacyclopentanes are intermediates in the metal-catalysed dimerization, trimerization, and tetramerization of ethylene to give 1-butene, 1-hexene, and 1-octene, respectively. These compounds are of commercial interest as comonomers, used in the production of polyethylene.
In the evolution of heterogeneous alkene metathesis catalysts, metallacyclopentanes are invoked as intermediates in the formation of metal alkylidenes from ethylene. Thus, metallacyclopentane intermediates are proposed to isomerize to metallacyclobutanes, which can eliminate alkene giving the alkylidene.
Structure.
Unsubstituted metallacyclopentanes adopt conformations related to cyclopentane itself: open-envelope conformation and a twisted open-envelope structure.

Kent Karosen

Kent L. Karosen was an American businessman, author and philanthropist who served on the board of several charitable organizations. He was the President and CEO of the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation, a nonprofit health organization.
For many years he had been a managing director and Partner at Cantor Fitzgerald, a Wall Street firm. The company's offices, located on floors 101 to 105 of 1 World Trade Center, were destroyed by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, killing 658 of the company's 960 New York employees.
On October 1, 2001, Karosen organized a memorial service in New York's Central Park for over 4,000 family members and friends of those killed. Until his death, he continued to put together an annual celebration of life event for the families of Cantor Fitzgerald's victims on the anniversary of the attacks.
In the fall of 2016, Karosen wrote, with children's book author Chana Stiefel, "Why Can't Grandma Remember My Name?", which juxtaposes paintings and drawings created by children with those created by Alzheimer's patients. It tackles a child's questions such as "How can I have fun with Grandma?" and "Will Grandma get worse?" and offers advice for families coping with the illness, with royalties benefiting the foundation.
Karosen was on the Board of Trustees of the Intrepid Sea, Air, &amp; Space Museum Foundation and was the chairman of its investment committee. He served on the board of directors of Temple Emanu-El Synagogue in Miami Beach, Florida.
Kent died at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Florida on Thursday, December 6, 2018, at the age of 53. Kent was born in Kansas City, Missouri, to Mary Vivian and Leon Karosen, who lived in Mission Hills, Kansas. His father, Leon, was an owner of the Kansas City Kings, the National Basketball Association team, and Youthcraft Coats and Suits, Inc.
After graduating from Kenyon College with a Bachelor of Arts in History and extensive study in economics, Kent went on to become a commercial real estate developer in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1991, Kent joined Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P., the Manhattan securities firm. He was a partner and managing director and worked closely with the chairman in resolving numerous special situations by utilizing his long-standing expertise in a myriad of business arenas. Before working in the office of the chairman, Kent was instrumental in the development and success of the Securities Lending Desk at Cantor Fitzgerald. In 1992, he founded the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum's "Museum Society" where he created the Salute to Freedom Award and dinner, a tradition that has raised over $20 million for the museum. The award has honored leaders such as presidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton; Prime Ministers Thatcher and Rabin and Secretaries Cohen and Powell.
Kent's skills and efforts proved critical to Cantor Fitzgerald's recovery after the September 11 attacks destroyed the firm's headquarters in the World Trade Center. The day after the tragedy, he organized and managed the Crisis Center to aid the 658 families of the victims of the 9/11 attacks and continued to organize Cantor's annual memorial service in honor of his fallen colleagues. In May 2001, Kent was named an Honorary Commodore in the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary for the 1st Southern Region. Additionally, he was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Michael Stern Parkinson's Foundation and served as the Chairman of its Investment Committee. Not one to miss an opportunity to do the right thing, Kent headed the team to secure temporary headquarters for Cantor Fitzgerald and directed the search for their permanent headquarters. He was instrumental in the lease negations for Cantor Fitzgerald's 190,000 sq. ft. new headquarters as well as Cantor's public incentives to rebuild in New York City. Concurrently, Kent was a principal in securing for Cantor Fitzgerald and other firms directly affected by the 9/11 attacks over $30 million in federal, state and city aid to rebuild.
In 2006, Honorable Scott Stringer appointed Kent as his representative to the Times Square Alliance board. Kent was also a board member for the New York City Fund for Public Advocacy, Midwest Chapter of the Leukemia Society, United States Coast Guard Foundation and the Wilbraham Monson Academy. He later joined the boards of the Intrepid Foundation and the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation where he had served as the foundation's President and CEO since 2009.
In 2008, he married the love of his life, Brian Byrl Hauserman, in Provincetown, Massachusetts and again in a religious ceremony in New York City, NY. Mr. Hauserman was a residential broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman in Manhattan. Together, they managed the business consulting firm, Karosen Strategic Partners, LLC where Kent served as President. They relocated to Miami Beach, Florida where Kent became enthusiastically active in the Jewish community. He served on the board of directors for the Temple Emanu-El Synagogue. Kent was a force to be reckoned with and he lived his life on his own terms to the fullest.
He was very generous and saw the potential in others. He strategically figured out various ways to connect the dots and expand his influence to raise money and awareness for worthy causes. His feisty spirit will be missed by all who knew him. Surviving Kent is his husband Brian Hauserman, sister Valerie K. Gaines, two puppies Mazel and Tova, and scores of dear friends whom he loved like family. Brian Hauserman died on September 16th, 2019.

2007 Jakarta gubernatorial election

A gubernatorial election was held in Jakarta on 8 August 2007 to elect the Governor of Jakarta for the five-year term between 2007 and 2012. It was the first direct election for the capital city. Incumbent Sutiyoso did not participate in the election, with his deputy Fauzi Bowo facing off against former police general Adang Daradjatun.
Fauzi Bowo, which received the political support of a major coalition of political parties, won the election and secured nearly 58% of the 3.6 million votes while his opponent received about 1.5 million despite being backed by just PKS.
Background.
Prior to 2005, regional leaders such as governors and mayors were indirectly elected by the regional legislative body ("Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah"), which members were elected in public elections. It was not until 2005 when this system was replaced by direct elections for local areas.
The previous governor, Sutiyoso, was reelected for his second term through the indirect method with Fauzi Bowo as his deputy on September 2002, in a vote held in the midst of demonstrations against his governance. Observers described the results as "expected".
Candidates.
Sitting vice governor Fauzi Bowo received the support of a major coalition of parties, while his opponent Anang Daradjatun only managed to secure the support of the Prosperous Justice Party - which had previously won the local elections of Jakarta's satellite cities of Bekasi and Depok. Outside the two, several other figures such as Agum Gumelar and Faisal Basri were also potential candidates, but did not manage to secure backing.
Then-academist Anies Baswedan noted the large amount of negotiations and transactions involved with the formation of the coalition.
Issues.
The primary issues contested were chronic poverty and unemployment in addition to the city's traffic jams and annual flooding. Topics such as corruption and Islam's role in public life also became campaigning areas.
Fauzi Bowo's campaign in particular claimed that Daradjatun's governorship will result in limitations for the city's nightlife because of his backing from the islamist PKS. The latter denied this and in turn accused Fauzi of being indebted to his political backers. Daradjatun also accused the previous administration of incompetence.
Results.
Following early vote counts, Anang-Dani conceded their defeat before the official results were released. Fauzi Bowo-Prijanto were officially declared as winners of the election on 16 August, after securing 2,109,511 (57.87%) of the votes while Anang gained 1,535,555 (42.13%) votes. The former pair won in all constituent cities (and the Thousand Islands Regency). The turnout of over 3.6 million voters (~65%) exceeded expectations.
Aftermath.
The election was mentioned in a diplomatic cable brought up by WikiLeaks, which noted that "despite the intense press coverage of the election and its national importance, the Jakarta elites have rigged the game". Fauzi Bowo would later run again for his second term in 2012, in which he lost to Joko Widodo.

Chief Kivoi Mwendwa

Chief Kivoi Mwendwa (born in the 1780s) was a Kamba long distance trader and slaver who lived in the present day Kitui. Kivoi is most famous for guiding missionaries into the interior of the present day Kenya after he guided the German missionaries Johann Ludwig Krapf and Johannes Rebmann of the Anglican Church Missionary Society (CMS). During the trips, both Rebmann and Krapf came within visual distance of Mount Kenya.
Kivoi met the two Europeans in Mombasa and traveled with them to Ukambani where, on December 3rd 1849, they became the first white people to see Mount Kenya.
Back in Europe, their reports of snow on the equatorial mountain were met with disbelief and ridicule for many years. 
Chief Kivoi interacted with Arabs in the coast and Voi town was named for him because that was one of his stop overs towns where caravans settled before entered into the coastal town of Mombasa. According locals of Voi Town, Kivoi settled along Voi River in the mid 1800s.
His actual birth date is unknown as it is not recorded but he is believed to have lived between 1780s to 19 August 1852. His descendants are not known in historical context but he was extensively mentioned by Dr. Ludwig Krapf in his Mission to Africa.
Death.
According to Dr. Ludwig Krapf, Kivoi and his immediate followers were killed after their caravan was attacked by robbers in the second expedition in Tana River 2 miles from Yatta.
According to his diary entry Ludwig Krapf says, "This expedition proved most calamitous, and, as already mentioned, Krapf's 'escape with life was a marvel'."
"When within a mile or two of the Dana, the party was suddenly attacked by robbers. The greater part of the caravan was instantly dispersed, Kivoi's people flying in all directions; Kivoi himself was killed with his immediate followers; Krapf fired his gun twice, but into the air, 'for', said he, 'I could not bring myself to shed the blood of man'; and then he found himself in the bash, separated from both friend and foe, and flying in what he supposed to be the best direction."
After the death of Chief Kivoi, Ludwig Krapf was accused of causing his death and the Akamba condemned him to die. At midnight he managed to escape, and fled in the direction of Yatta. His perils were now greater than before, as he was in an inhabited country, and feared to travel by day lest he should be detected and murdered, while at night he frequently missed his way, and in the dense darkness of the forests his compass was of little use.

Pike River Conservation Park

 
Pike River Conservation Park is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Mundic Creek about north-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about south of the town of Paringa.
The conservation park consists of crown land in section 66 the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Paringa. It came into existence on 1 February 1979 by proclamation under the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972". It is named after Pike River, a stream which flows through its eastern end. On 10 December 2009, crown land in section 84 of the Hundred of Paringa which was formerly the "Mundic Forest Reserve" was added to its extent. It is located at the northern end of the locality of Mundic Creek with a boundary adjoining the Sturt Highway in east. As of 2016, it covered an area of .
In 1980, it was described as follows:Pike River Conservation Park protects part of a permanent wetland area and adjacent land on the River Murray flood plain. This area is a valuable feeding and breeding habitat for water birds. Dominant vegetation is open woodland of "Eucalyptus camaldulensis" and "E. largiflorens" over an understorey of scattered "Muehlenbeckia cunninghamii". Areas of "Atriplex vesicaria", "Bassia" sp. and "Arthrocnemum" spp. Low shrublands are also found while reedbeds of "Typha" sp. and "Phragmites australis" occupy lagoon shores. A small area above the flood plain is occupied by an open woodland of "E oleosa" and "Myoporum platycarpum". The park only occupies a small portion of a large backwater system. Many of the large "E. camaldulensis" are dead and the understorey in some areas is dominated by introduced weed species.
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

Mathurin Rodier

Mathurin Rodier or Mathelin Rodier was a French architect born around 1410 and died around 1484. He was the architect of the Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul of Nantes Cathedral for at least 36 years, starting no later than 1444 and ending no earlier than 1480.
Biography.
The information regarding Mathurin Rodier (also known as Mathelin Rodier) is fragmentary. We know he was coming to Nantes from Tours, where he had a brother, Jean Rodier, and that in 1484, he was married to Édeline Ponset
Il travaille sur le chantier de la cathédrale Saint-Gatien de Tours under the direction of Jean de Dammartin between 1431 and 1434, to a position equivalent to that of Jean Benoist and Huguet of Dammartin, son of Jean. Before 1444 he went to Nantes, where he took charge of several building sites, on the Saint-Nicolas gate, the , the cathedral, the Château des ducs de Bretagne, the .
The presence of Mathurin Rodier at the head of the Nantes cathedral site is attested in 1444, with the charge of maistre masson. Most of the few writings concerning him still preserved relate to his emoluments. While managing the site, he was obliged to perform periods of city guard (according to a 1468 text), an obligation instituted by the municipality. A document from 1477 shows that Rodier was exempted from this charge in return for payment.
In 1480 the canons in charge of supervising the building site decided to add Jean Le Maître to Mathurin Rodier, then approximately 70 years old. His ageing is undoubtedly the cause of this novelty, and in the same year the load of the building site was withdrawn, at the end of a remarkably long period for the time. The last written record of Rodier is of an anniversary he and his wife celebrated at Saint-Laurent Church on August 6 or 9, 1484. So he died after that date, most likely in Nantes.

Funny Story

Funny Story is a 2018 tragicomedy film, directed by Michael J. Gallagher and co-written by Gallagher and Steve Greene. It stars Matthew Glave, Emily Bett Rickards and Jana Winternitz. The film premiered as an official selection at the 2018 Slamdance Film Festival on January 21, 2018.
Plot.
Aging TV star Walter Campbell's (Matthew Glave) attempts to break up with younger girlfriend Lucy (Daisye Tutor) are thwarted by the announcement of her pregnancy. Looking for space, Walter resolves to visit his estranged daughter Nic (Jana Winternitz), currently residing in Big Sur, resentful of her father's neglectful parenting and womanizing ways. He agrees to give a lift to Nic's friend Kim (Emily Bett Rickards), who having recently attended the funeral of her estranged mother, is dealing with her own emotional baggage.
Upon arriving in Big Sur, Walter discovers that Nic is living on a lesbian commune, and is in fact due to get married. Nic is appreciative of Walter's acceptance of her sexuality, which sees the pair's relationship begin to repair, but this newly formed bond is at risk of being destroyed once and for all.
Cast.
Co-writer Steve Greene appears in a cameo during the film, dressed as an alien centaur, during scenes featuring the character of Walter's fictional television series.
Production.
Development.
Gallagher and writing partner Steve Green began developing the project in 2015. Having previously worked heavily on genre-based projects, the pair wanted to develop a fictional story that drew more deeply upon the experiences and feelings of themselves and of people in their lives. Talking about his motivations for developing the film, Gallagher stated "I wanted to make a film about forgiveness. Can we forgive someone who has truly wronged us? Or is their wrong doing just a matter of our myopic perspective? ... I wanted to tell a grown-up story about people who behave in childish ways."
Initially struggling to find a production company willing to finance the film, by 2017 the success of Gallagher and Winterniz's production company Cinemand enabled them to finance the feature independently.
Casting.
The part of Nic was specifically written with Winternitz in mind. On casting Glave, Gallagher noted that it took some time to find the right actor for the part of Walter and that he was looking for "someone who could be charming, oblivious, deeply narcissistic-- but deep down have a good heart". With regard to casting Rickards as Kim, he stated "I knew that by casting Emily, when Kim made tough choices, the audience could see that deep down she is a good person who is just lost at this moment in time."
Filming.
Filming took place in Los Angeles, California, in June 2017 and on location at Topanga Canyon and Big Sur. The film was shot in its entirety over 15 days. Director Gallagher took the decision to shoot the whole film with a wide-angle lens, something he believed benefited the comedic nature of the film and showcased the actors' interactions, as it was "fun to let them breathe and experience the awkwardness of being stuck in this shot together."
Release.
The film premiered as an official selection at the 2018 Slamdance Film Festival, as part of the festival's 'Beyond Program', with director Gallagher and the cast in attendance. The film was the runner-up in the festival's Audience Award for Beyond Feature.
The film was also featured as a special presentation at the San Luis Obispo International Film Festival, and was an official selection at the Omaha Film Festival, the Sonoma International Film Festival, where it was awarded the Stolman Audience Award for Best American Indie, the OUT Shine Festival in Miami and the Vero Beach Wine and Film Festival in Florida, where the film won the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature. It made its European premiere at the Lucca Film Festival in Italy, in April 2018 and was an official selection at the Santorini Film Festival in Greece in June 2018, where it won Best Feature Film. It was also awarded the Grand Jury Prize for Narrative Feature at the Barcelona Film Festival. The film premiered in New York in July 2018 as an official selection at the Stony Brook Film Festival and premiered in New England in the same month as an official selection at the Woods Hole Film Festival where it won the Jury Prize for Best Narrative Feature, Comedy. In August, the film screened as an official selection at the 2018 Rhode Island International Film Festival where it won first prize in the Alternative Spirit Award (Feature) category.
The film made its Canadian premiere at the Cinéfest Sudbury International Film Festival in Ontario in September 2018 and premiered in the UK at the Southampton International Film Festival in October 2018, where it won the award for Best Feature Screenplay and Best Actor for Matthew Glave. In October of the same year, it featured as the opening film at the Evolution Mallorca International Film Festival.
The film went on a limited theatrical release on May 24, 2019, and was made available for digital download from the same date.
Reception.
The film garnered mainly positive reviews following its film festival screenings. Danielle Solzman of "Cultured Vultures" noted the strong ensemble of female characters in the film, and in particular felt Rickards delivered "the performance of a lifetime". Stephen Saito of "The Movable Feast" praised the command of language in Gallagher and Greene's script, as well as the performances of Glave and Rickards, noting how both "impressively toe the line between blustery self-regard and the vulnerability it hides as Walter and Kim". Similarly, Kimberley Pierce of "Geek Girl Authority" noted how much of the film's success hinged on the strong performances of the cast, in particular Glave, who "singlehandedly dictates the comedic tone of the movie" and Rickards, who "seems to in on the inherent conflict within Kimberly". Writing for "Film Threat", Anthony Ray Bench praised the cast's performances, in particular those of Glave and Rickards, citing the film's "dry sense of humor that the actors execute perfectly". However, he was disappointed with the film's ending, and felt that it "set itself up for so much potential drama...and instead it all just sort of peters out". Mark Kelly of "Cinemaslice" praised the character development throughout the movie, and how this made "the plot twists and heavy emotional moments later on in the film feel that much more impactful". Luca Ciccioni of "Anonima Cinefili" praised Gallagher's accomplished filming, photography and editing. Writing for the Great Lakes-based magazine "The Review", Robert E Martin described the film as being "Filled with memorable characters and top-notch performances".
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 6.89/10. Metacritic, using a weighted average, gave the film 57/100 based on five reviews, summarized as a mixed or average rating.

Boo'd Up

"Boo'd Up" is the debut commercial single by English singer Ella Mai from her third extended play, "Ready". Serving as the lead single for the EP, the song peaked at number five on the "Billboard" Hot 100 in the United States. It was a minor hit in her native UK, peaking at 52 whilst peaking within the top 50 in Australia and Canada. A remix featuring Nicki Minaj and Quavo peaked at number 8 in New Zealand. The song was written by Mai, Joelle James, Dijon "Mustard" McFarlane and Larrance Dopson of 1500 or Nothin', and produced by the latter two. It was nominated for Song of the Year and won Best R&amp;B Song at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.
Background and release.
American songwriter Joelle James first wrote "Boo'd Up" in 2014 originally for herself. She later looked for an artist to give the song to, eventually giving it to Ella Mai after feeling that "synergy of it would be perfect for her."
Mai originally released the song in February 2017 as part of the "Ready" EP. "Boo'd Up" rose in popularity on social media as well as in nightclubs over the next few months, notably in the Bay Area and later in Dallas, Texas. After Mai served as the opening act on Kehlani's tour, her music reached a bigger audience and the song grew on radio airplay in the spring of 2018. The song became her first top 10 song in the US in the following month, deeming it her "breakthrough hit". "Rolling Stone" wrote that the single is "one of the biggest singles by a breakout female R&amp;B singer in the past 10 years."
In support of the song and its commercial success, Mai announced a concert tour titled the Boo'd Up Tour in the US during the month of August.
In December 2018, "Billboard" magazine ranked "Boo'd Up" as the third best song of the year.
Music video.
An accompanying music video for the song, directed by Nick Walker, premiered via Mai's Vevo channel on 26 April 2018. It features cameo appearances from singer Khalid, rapper Kamaiyah, and YouTube personality Alissa Ashley. Model Donnell Blaylock Jr. plays Mai's love interest in the video.
As of August 2021, the music video has over 460 million views.
Remixes.
Rappers Nicki Minaj, Fetty Wap, Plies, Fabolous, Dave East, Vado and Young Dro (inayah lamis) released remixes to the song.
Live performances.
On 17 November 2018, Mai performed the song on "Saturday Night Live", with "Jezebel" describing Mai as "Pure '90s R&amp;B Heartthrob". It comes on the heels of Ella Mai’s critically acclaimed performance at the BET Awards 2018.
Nicki Minaj and Quavo remix.
A remix of "Boo'd Up" with rapper Nicki Minaj and Quavo was released 4 July 2018.
The remix version of the song features newly added verses and lyrics by both Quavo and Minaj and marks the second collaboration between the two. Its music was also slightly modified with several parts being reorganized and changed. Some of the lyrics in Minaj's verse of the song are: Still a Playboy bunny on Hef, though/So we gotta get the dollar like Creflo/He said that he want respect/I said, "That's dope"/But that goes both ways like DeJ Loaf, uh.
Composition.
The music of "Boo'd Up" is mostly kept the same as the original, with the sound being slightly altered and several parts reorganized. The remix also contains a reference to Minaj's 2011 hit, "Super Bass". Migos member Quavo drops an ad-libbed verse of his own. The remix comes to a close with a faux recorded phone conversation between Quavo and Minaj. She asks him to be picked up from somewhere but he's actually already outside.

Latin America–United Kingdom relations

Latin America–United Kingdom relations are relations between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the countries of Latin America. 
England and Great Britain had long-standing interests in colonial Latin America, including privateering, the slave trade (and its abolition), and founding their own colonies in the West Indies. Britain supported the independence of the Latin American colonies from Spain around 1820, and developed extensive trade and financial relationships with most of the newly independent countries, opening shipping lines and building railways. After the Spanish–American War of 1898, American financial interests increasingly played a role in the diplomatic relations. Traditional British business interests continued until most of its regional assets were sold in 1914–1918 to pay for the British war effort during the First World War. 
After 1820, British military involvements were minimal in the region. A boundary squabble with Venezuela in the 1890s turned dangerous when the United States intervened; there were no profound issues involved and the dispute was soon permanently resolved. 
The UK operated a programme of covert action in Latin America in the 1960s. There was a short war to expel an Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982.
Colonial era.
In the colonial era of Latin America before 1820, England and Great Britain was allied with Portugal, and maintained friendly diplomatic relations with Portugal's colony in Brazil. Despite this, English privateers launched attacks on Brazilian ports, such as Santos in 1591.
However, there was often serious hostility with Spain. Independent English privateers frequently attacked Spanish interests, and dreamed of somehow attacking and seizing the annual Spanish fleet that brought gold and silver back to Spain. The 16th century, Sir John Hawkins and Sir Francis Drake were leading privateers. In the 17th century the Caribbean was a favourite target, especially 1655 two 1670 on Spanish ships and Spanish towns. In various wars, English privateers seized bases in Spanish Jamaica and other Spanish colonies in the Caribbean, and buccaneers established a foothold on the mainland in Central America. In 1671, Welsh privateer Henry Morgan sacked and burned Panama City, looting its treasures of gold, silver and jewels, but overlooking the golden altar, which had been painted over to disguise its value. Morgan at the time was Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica. From his base in Port Royal, Jamaica, he raided settlements and shipping on the Spanish Main, becoming wealthy as he use the prize money gained to purchase three large sugar plantations.
British merchants handled most of the trade between Europe and Latin America, due to few Spanish or Portuguese merchants being in competition. By 1824 as Spain left the region about 90 British commercial houses were operating in the former Spanish colonies, with a concentration in Buenos Aires. Already in 1810 there were 200 in Brazil. The Atlantic slave trade had significant British participation until the British outlawed it in 1807, and in 1833 abolished slavery in all its colonies. Spain granted exclusive rights to the British South Sea Company to supply slaves to its colonies. The South Sea Company simultaneously engaged in illegal commercial trade as well, and once Spain tried to stop it the result was the Anglo-Spanish War of Jenkins Ear that dragged on for a decade after 1739. The war began after Welsh merchant Robert Jenkins was seized by Spanish sailors who cut off his ears. The British captured Porto Bello in November 1739. Governor James Oglethorpe of Georgia led an attack on St. Augustine, Florida, in 1740; Spain retaliated with an attack in St. Simon's Island, Georgia.
During the Napoleonic Wars of 1801–1815, Spain was allied with Napoleon and its colonies were now a potential target for the Royal Navy. The result was two British invasions of the River Plate. British Admiral Home Riggs Popham launched an invasion of the Spanish colony of La Plata (modern-day Argentina). Popham had an army of 1500 men, who quickly captured the fort at Buenos Aires, capturing the city of 55,000 inhabitants. Argentine creoles (that is, native-born men of Spanish descent) mobilized their local and nearby forces, including 1,000 soldiers from the nearby city of Montevideo. They overpowered the British, who surrendered on August 14, 1806. In response London sent new armies to Buenos Aires and Valparaiso. The second British attack came in 1807, as British General John Whitelocke brought 12,000 soldiers for his invasions of Montevideo and Buenos Aires. The decisive battle came in June 1807; the Argentines were outnumbered 12,000 to 9,000. They nevertheless prevailed and the British again surrendered. Meanwhile, Napoleon invaded Portugal, and the Royal Navy rescued the royal family taking it to Brazil. The great British naval victory at Trafalgar in October 1805 decisively gave control of the oceans to the British, and ended Napoleonic overseas dreams.
Independence era after 1820.
The French invasion of Spain opened two decades (1806–26) of military conflict over control of the Spanish colonies. By 1818, Spain had regained control of all of its colonies. Suddenly starting in 1819, with the return of Simón Bolívar from exile Spain's power collapsed and one after another succeeded in breaking away, except for Cuba. Admiral Thomas Cochrane was the most prominent of some 10,000 British mercenaries hired to organize the ad hoc armies and navies fighting for independence from Spain. Cochrane organised and led the rebel navies of Chile and Brazil and helped Peru as well.
The independence of Latin American countries after 1826, opened lucrative prospects for London financiers. The region was gravely devastated by the wars of independence, and with weak financial systems, weak governments and repeated coups and internal rebellions. However, the region had a well-developed export sector focused on the foods that were in demand in Europe, especially sugar, coffee, wheat and (after the arrival of refrigeration in the 1860s), beef. There also was a well-developed mining sector. With the Spanish out of the picture, the region in the early 1820s was a devastated region suffering in a deep depression. It urgently needed capital, entrepreneurs, financiers, and shippers. Britain rushed in to fill the void by the middle 1820s, as the London government use its diplomatic power to encourage large-scale investment. the Royal Navy provided protection against piracy. The British established communities of merchants in major cities—including 3,000 Britons in Buenos Aires. London financiers purchased £17 million in Latin American government bonds, especially those of Argentina, Chile, Peru and Mexico. They invested another £35 million in 46 stock companies set up to operate primarily in Latin America. The bubble soon burst, but the survivors operated quietly and profitably for many decades. In the 1820s-1850s, over 260 British merchant houses operated in the River Plate or Chile, and hundreds more in the rest of Latin America. The Latin American market was important for the cotton manufacturers of Lancashire. They supported the independence movement, and persuaded the British government to station commercial consuls in all the major trading centers in Latin America. the British were permanently committed, and it took decades – until the 1860s – before the commercial and involvement paid serious dividends. By 1875, Latin America was firmly integrated into transatlantic economy under British leadership. After 1898, the British had to compete commercially with the Americans.
In long-term perspective, Britain's influence in Latin America was enormous after independence came in the 1820s. Britain intentionally sought to replace the Spanish in economic and cultural affairs. Military issues and the establishment of new colonies were minor factors. The influence was exerted through diplomacy, trade, banking, and investment in railways and mines. The English language and British cultural norms were transmitted by energetic young British business agents on temporary assignment in the major commercial centers, where they inviting locals into the British leisure activities, such as organized sports, and into their transplanted cultural institutions such as clubs and schools. The impact on sports was overwhelming, as Latin America enthusiastically took up football (soccer). In Argentina, rugby, polo, tennis and golf became important in middle-class leisure. Cricket was ignored. The British role never disappeared, but it faded rapidly after 1914 as the British cashed in their investments to pay for their Great War, and the United States moved into the region with overwhelming force and similar cultural norms.
Confrontations.
There were no actual wars directly involving Britain, however there were several confrontations. The most serious came in 1845-1850 when British and French navies blockaded Buenos Aires in order to protect the independence of Uruguay from Juan Manuel de Rosas, the dictator of Argentina. Other lesser controversies with Argentina broke out in 1833, with Guatemala in 1859, Mexico in 1861, Nicaragua in 1894, and Venezuela in 1895 and 1902. There also was tension along the Mosquito Coast in Central America in the 1830s and 1840s.
Transoceanic canal.
London's interest in Central America began in the 17th century, focused first in Belize, Roatán, and the Mosquito Coast (which became the east coast of Nicaragua and Honduras). Washington's interest began in 1824 with the diplomatic recognition of the five states of Central America. Britain consolidated its hold on the Caribbean shore and an unforeseen result was a direct clash with the United States. In 1848 the U.S. saw the need a transoceanic canal, a plan reinforced by the flood of gold seekers using a Central-American transit route in 1849. One route under consideration went through Nicaragua but was frustrated by British control of the Mosquito Coast. This conflict was resolved in 1850 when the two powers agreed in the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty to renounce territorial possessions along the route of a possible canal. To prevent the domination of Pacific trade routes by the other, each agreed that any canal would be neutral and they would not acquire formal colonies on the route. In 1901 Britain renounced its claims in the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty, allowing the United States to build the Panama Canal, which opened in 1914.
Informal empire in Latin America.
In a highly influential interpretation, John Andrew Gallagher and Ronald Robinson argue that the perceived pause in British expansion in the mid-19th century is misleading, for Britain's was in fact successful in achieving its main goal of building an informal empire, with strong economic relationships to small independent countries, especially in Latin America. Other historians have found that coercion was seldom necessary in Latin America and the British government played a passive role. The Royal Navy made sure that London's fast overseas network was well protected. London provided finance, insurance, and shipping, handled imports and exports, purchased and refinanced of bonds and government debts, and sent money and engineers to build the railway network. Young British agents on temporary duty in every major port provided close links to the mother country, and provided a model of middle-class business and cultural leadership that many Latin Americans emulated. Latin American business realized the advantage of close ties with the world's leading banker and trader. Gallagher and Robinson argue that using:
Search for cotton.
Cotton textiles were Britain's leading manufacturing product in the mid-19th century, and most of the raw cotton came from the southern United States. The American Civil War cut off most of the supply, although small amounts were available through blockade runners, and through purchases in New York of cotton owned by the Union. It became a high British priority to find new sources, looking especially Egypt, India, and Brazil.
20th century.
Britain operated a programme of covert action in Latin America in the 1960s, including attempts to influence elections and to disrupt trade unions in a number of countries. The aims were to counter communism, develop trade links and win influence with the United States.
Leading nations.
Argentina.
They established diplomatic relations on 15 December 1823. By mid-century, London bankers were sending in capital, to invest in railways, docks, packing houses, and utilities. London sent in 3000 agents to handle shipping, insurance, and banking.
There was still a labor shortage, which was solved when Italian and Spanish immigrants started to migrate to Argentina, often on British passenger liners. Britain was the main purchaser of Argentine beef and grain. During the Second World War, Argentina refused to go along with the American anti-German policies. The United States responded by trying to shut down Argentine exports. President Franklin Roosevelt asked Prime Minister Winston Churchill to stop buying Argentine beef and grain. Churchill refused, saying the food was urgently needed.
They went to war—the Falklands War—over ownership of the Falkland Islands in 1982; Britain drove out Argentine invaders.
Brazil.
In 1807, all members of the royal court of Portugal (probably 4,000 to 7,000 individuals) relocated to Brazil in the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil to avoid being captured by the French. Pedro the Prince Regent ruled because his mother, Queen Carlota, was insane. Brazilian trade had been limited to the mother country, but now the Prince Regent expanded it to encourage commerce with all friendly nations, especially Great Britain. This expansion of trade led to the economic and eventually political independence of Brazil from Portugal in 1822.
Slave trade.
The two nations established diplomatic relations in 1826, after the British imposed a treaty pledging the total abolition of the Atlantic slave trade. By the 1830s, British financiers and merchants effectively controlled the leading sectors of the Brazilian economy. A high priority of the British government was ending the large-scale Brazilian slave trade, but Brazilian elites strongly resisted, saying the treaties had been coerced and were invalid. in 1845, the Royal Navy started to target Brazilian slave ships seizing the ships and freeing the slaves onboard. Tensions escalated and there was a threat of war. Meanwhile, Brazilian plantation owners imported as many slaves as they possibly could, 19,000 in 1846, and 50,000 in 1847. Finally, in 1850, the Brazilian government passed laws that virtually ended Brazilian involvement in the slave trade. That ended the tension with Britain, but the practise of slavery continued in Brazil. By the 1850s, Brazil provided about a third of the raw cotton used in British factories.
They were allies in the Second World War, fighting alongside each other in Italy against Nazi Germany.
Chile.
British naval officers assisted Chile in its fight for independence, and over the following decades a number of Britons settled in Chile such as in Coquimbo. In tandem with British investors, Chile entered world economic trade during the 1810s-1830s. the new country was poor, but investors were optimistic regarding its resources in agriculture and mining. Copper and silver production increased, as did farm output. The population grew, and trade rapidly expanded. most important, Chile developed the institutional mechanisms for sustained economic growth and more complex trade relationships.
Mexico.
After Mexico achieved its independence in 1821, Britain was the first European "great power" to recognize Mexican sovereignty. Soon afterwards, Emperor Agustín de Iturbide sent a diplomatic envoy to London to establish diplomatic communications between the two nations. In 1837, Mexico signed a treaty with Britain to abolish the slave trade. The British established a network of merchant houses in the major cities. However, according to Hilarie J. Heath, the results were bleak: trade was stagnant, imports did not pay, contraband drove prices down, debts private and public went unpaid, merchants suffered all manner of injustices and operated at the mercy of weak and corruptible governments, with commercial houses skirting bankruptcy.
In 1861, Mexican President Benito Juarez suspended Mexico's interest payments to its creditors in France, Spain and the UK. This act angered the three nations and in October 1861 by the Convention of London the three sent a joint naval force to Mexico to demand repayment. In December 1861 the "triple-alliance" took the port of Veracruz and nearby towns. After a few months, both the Spanish and British government became aware that Emperor Napoleon III of France was planning to colonize Mexico in order to expand its empire and take advantage of the fact that the United States was tied down in its civil war and was not able to enforce the Monroe Doctrine. In early 1862, Britain and Spain pulled their forces from Mexico, but France took control and imposed an emperor. He was defeated and executed by Juarez in 1867.
After 1880, the British turned their attention in Mexico primarily to investments in railways and mines, sending both money and engineers and skilled mechanics. The British invested £7.4 million in railways during the decade of the 1880s, jumping to £53.4 million in 1910s. The decade-total of new investment in mining went from £1.3 million in 1880s to £11.6 million in 1910s. Investments in land and other properties rose from near zero in 1880s to £19.7 million in 1910s. The totals reached £135 million, almost as much as the United States. In 1900, there were 2,800 British citizens living in Mexico, a relatively small number in contrast to the 15,000 Americans, 16,000 Spaniards, 4,000 French, and 2,600 Germans. The British were famed for their sophisticated gentlemen clubs, and their elaborate sports program—English football became a highly popular sport across Mexico; while cricket was ignored.
In 1938 the government of Lázaro Cárdenas nationalised land owned by British oil companies in Mexico. After 1945, bilateral relations normalized and trade re-commenced.
Venezuela.
During the Venezuelan crisis of 1895 there was a longstanding dispute between the United Kingdom and Venezuela about the territory of Guayana Esequiba, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela asserting the region as Venezuelan territory. The dispute had become a diplomatic crisis when Venezuelan representatives argued that British behaviour over the issue violated the 1823 Monroe Doctrine and used its influence in the American government to pursue the matter. US President Grover Cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the doctrine that did forbade new European colonies but also declared an American interest in any matter in the hemisphere. After tense diplomatic dialogues, the British government accepted the US demand for arbitration. The status of the territory later became subject to the Geneva Agreement of 1966, which was signed by the United Kingdom, Venezuela and British Guiana on 17 February 1966. This treaty stipulates that the parties will agree to find a practical, peaceful and satisfactory solution to the dispute. Disputes over the territory have continued since, even after Guyana was granted independence the same year.
The United Kingdom was involved in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903, in which Britain was involved in a Italo-German blockade of Venezuela to enforce payment of Venezuelan debts.

Dublin Review of Books

The Dublin Review of Books (drb) is an Irish review of literature, history, the arts, and culture.
The magazine publishes long-form essays exploring themes related to newly published books; shorter, more conventional book reviews; blog entries on a wider variety of topics; and short extracts from books that highlight their broader arguments.
History.
Established in 2006, the drb launched its first full issue as an online quarterly review in Spring 2007. Founded and jointly edited by Enda O'Doherty, an "Irish Times" journalist, and Maurice Earls, the proprietor of Books Upstairs bookshop in Dublin, it is consciously modelled on its near-namesakes, the "New York Review of Books" and the "London Review of Books". The magazine aims to provide writers with a forum to develop their arguments and share knowledge in longer review-essays than those found in conventional newspapers and magazines. Along with "The Dublin Review", "The Honest Ulsterman", "The Stinging Fly", "Poetry Ireland Review" and various other titles, it is one of a number of periodicals to have contributed to a boom in Irish literary journals over the past decade.
Since Autumn 2012, the drb has been published fortnightly online, with additional material published between each issue in the form of shorter blog posts.
Contributors.
Since the magazine's inception, many notable writers, poets, academics, diplomats, and politicians from Ireland and further afield have contributed to it. Previous contributors have included:

Diuris ochroma

Diuris ochroma, commonly known as pale goat orchid, or pale golden moths is a species of orchid that is endemic to south-eastern continental Australia. It has three or four leaves at its base and up to four slightly drooping pale yellow flowers with dark reddish purple streaks. It is an uncommon species found in two disjunct populations, in higher parts of each of New South Wales and Victoria.
Description.
"Diuris ochroma" is a tuberous, perennial herb with between three and four linear leaves long and wide. Up to four slightly drooping pale yellow flowers with dark reddish purple streaks and about wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal projects forward and is egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long, wide, lean downwards and are more or less parallel to each other.

Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris ochroma" was first formally described in 1994 by David Jones from a specimen collected near the Wonnangatta River and the description was published in "Muelleria". Jones stated that the specific epithet "ochroma" was derived from the Greek "ochroma", and means "pale" or "wan", referring to the pale yellow flowers of this species. In ancient Greek, "ochroma" (ὤχρωμα) is a noun meaning "pallor".
Distribution and habitat.
The pale goat orchid occurs in two disjunct areas, one in New South Wales and one in Victoria. The New South Wales population, estimated in 2008 to include about 130 plants, occurs on the Monaro Tableland. Two Victorian populations, estimated to contain a total of about eight thousand plants in 2010, are found in the Alpine National Park and on a roadside near Abbeyard.
Conservation.
"Diuris ochroma" is classed as "vulnerable" under the Australian Government "Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999", as "endangered" in New South Wales under the "Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016" and as "threatened" in Victoria under the "Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988". The main threats to the species are weed invasion, grazing by native, feral and stock animals, habitat loss and disturbance and inappropriate fire regimes.

O'Tacos

O'Tacos is a French fast food chain founded in 2007. Headquartered in Montrouge near Paris, O'Tacos has restaurants all over France and has also expanded internationally: it is found in various cities of Belgium, Germany, Algiers in Algeria, Marrakesh and Agadir in Morocco, and Utrecht in the Netherlands. The chain specializes in "French tacos", a fast food dish that consists of a flour tortilla wrap with French fries, meat and cheese.
History.
In 2007, Patrick Pelonero, Sliman Traoré, Samba Traoré and Sauroutou Diarra opened their first "French tacos" restaurant in Grenoble, in the Rhône-Alpes region where this French twist on a Mexican dish was pioneered. They later opened the first O'Tacos restaurant in Bordeaux in 2010. In 2014, they adopted the franchise system. The first restaurant under franchise opened in Ivry and 24 other restaurants followed during the same year.
International expansion.
Their first international opening was in Marrakech, Morocco. The chain then opened their first restaurant in Belgium in Schaerbeek, a Brussels neighbourhood, and their target customers are students. Since then it expanded further in Brussels as well as other Belgian cities including Ghent, Antwerp, and Charleroi. In January 2017, O'Tacos opened its first location in North America in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The Brooklyn location has since closed.
Products.
O'Tacos restaurants specialize in "French tacos", a fast food dish from the region of Rhône-Alpes in South-East France, which consists of a grilled flour tortilla folded around a filling of French fries, meat and cheese. They deliver made to order sandwiches, with customers getting to choose their own ingredients, such as the type of meat, sauce or additional ingredients, as well as the size (modeled after clothing sizes): M, L, XL, or XXL. Their signature product is the "Gigatacos" which weighs more than 2 kg (roughly 4.4 lbs). The chain uses halal-certified meat in order to accommodate Muslim customers.
Controversies.
Valenciennes restaurant.
On September 12, 2017, the publicized opening of a franchised restaurant in Valenciennes (with the presence of rapper Gradur) ended in clashes between the police and youths who came to the event. The restaurant then had to be closed for a week for administrative reasons. On December 2, 2017, the restaurant almost caught fire because of an electrical issue with one of the refrigerators, and had to be closed for several weeks. After a stand-off between the local authorities and the franchise holders, the restaurant reopened in December, with many customers expressing their enthusiasm on social media. On March 26, 2018, a newly-installed fryer caught fire, causing intervention from the fire department. The restaurant had to close again for a number of days.
Pigalle restaurant strike.
An O’Tacos restaurant located in the Paris neighbourhood of Pigalle was closed on February 9, 2018, as 24 employees went on strike, accusing the manager of not paying them for months, falsifying pay slips and withholding annual leave. Some employees also complained about sexual harassment and assault from their manager. The chain then publicly stated that they "opened an internal investigation" and the manager's license was suspended.
Qwartz restaurant incident.
On July 1, 2018, an expansion joint broke in an O'Tacos restaurant located in the mall in Villeneuve-la-Garenne, causing the floor tiles to pop off the floor one by one. Panic ensued in that part of the mall, as some customers believed they were under a terrorist attack, as reported by social media.

Via Balbi (Genoa)

Via Balbi is a street in the historical centre of Genoa, in Northwestern Italy, named after the aristocratic Genoese Balbi family. It is one of the "Strade Nuove" (Italian for "new streets") built by the Genoese aristocracy during the Renaissance. Since July 2006 it is inscribed in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Site .
History.
Formerly known as "Strada Balbi", the street was built between 1602 and 1620 as a cooperation between the city authorities and the Balbi family to improve the connection between the city center and the area around the harbor.
Between the first half of the 16th century and the first half of the 17th century, the nobility of the Republic of Genoa started a careful town planning to transform the existing medieval city and initiate a sizeable urban expansion to the North. The move to expand the antique palaces and to build new sumptuous ones was driven by the extraordinary wealth that came into the city through prosperous financing activities towards several European powers. In particular, the Genoese aristocracy financed the expensive undertakings of the Spanish Crown, such as the mercenary army that Spain kept in Flanders from 1566 to the peace of Westphalia in 1648. The ruling class of Genoa, mixing nobility of blood with new mercantile wealth, sought to underpin their prestige by the construction of grand city palaces and suburban villas of unusual splendor.
The first stretch of the street includes seven palaces, all formerly owned by the Balbi family, the former Collegium of the Jesuits (now the main seat of the University of Genoa) with the church of San Girolamo e Francesco Saverio and the Carmelite church of San Vittore e Carlo. The final stretch, which used to count eight 17th century monasteries, was modified in the 19th century, when the nearby train station of Genova Principe was built.

List of Parliamentary constituencies in the East Midlands (region)

The region of East Midlands is divided into 46 parliamentary constituencies which is made up of 12 Borough Constituencies and 34 County Constituencies. Since the General Election of December 2019, 38 are represented by Conservative MPs and 8 by Labour MPs.
Proposed boundary changes.
The Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before Parliament they were not brought forward by the Government for approval. Accordingly, they did not come into effect for the 2019 election which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.
Under the terms of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.
On 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Chloe Smith, issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. Subsequently, the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020 was passed into law on 14 December 2020. This formally removed the duty to implement the 2018 review and set out the framework for future boundary reviews. The Act provided that the number of constituencies should remain at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.
The Act specified that the next review should be completed no later than 1 July 2023 and the Boundary Commission formally launched the 2023 Review on 5 January 2021. The Commission have calculated that the number of seats to be allocated to the East Midlands region will increase by 1, from 46 to 47.

St. Mary's Church, Sønderborg

The St. Mary's Church is a church owned by the Church of Denmark in Sønderborg, Denmark and the church of the parish with the same name. Thanks to its location on a hill, the church building is very iconic for the city.
History.
In the Middle Ages there was a leper colony on a hill just outside the city. It was named after Saint George and around 1300 the chapel of this leper colony stood in the place of the present St. Mary's Church. After the old parish church of the city, the St. Nicholas Church, was demolished around 1530, the Saint-George chapel became the new main church. Towards the end of the 16th century, John II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg commissioned the enlargement of the building in order to make it suitable for the function of the parish church of his city.
The current St. Mary's Church.
In 1595 a start was made on the partial demolition of the old church and the construction of the new church. Only parts of the old medieval church remained. From the medieval church, a medieval wooden wall cupboard dating from about 1400 remained. The solemn inauguration of the new parish church took place just before Christmas in 1600. In 1649 the George Church was renamed as the Mary Church. The name of Saint George stayed in the Danish names "Sankt Jørgensgade" and "Jørgensbjerg".

Capcom Pro Tour 2017 regional finals

The regional finals of the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour were a series of closed "Street Fighter V" tournaments held throughout the world. The champions of the four different regions – North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia – automatically qualified to compete at the 2017 Capcom Cup. People qualified to compete in their regional finals by scoring highly on their regional leaderboard or winning ranking events during the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour. The four tournaments all took place between October 1 and November 19, 2017.
Background.
from April to September 2017, Capcom held a Ranking Event season with tournaments all over the world. Players of each of the four regions – Europe, Latin America, North America, and Asia – could compete in these tournaments in order to gain points towards their regional leaderboard standing. The top 7 players of each leaderboard qualified for their respective regional final. The winner of each regional final automatically qualified for the 2017 Capcom Cup and were awarded 400 points on the global leaderboards. Unlike the 2016 Capcom Pro Tour regional competition, the regional events were region-locked so only residents of that region are allowed to compete. While describing the details of the 2017 Capcom pro Tour, Capcom stated that they "felt we could do more to truly highlight the talent from each region. The events ended up effectively being last chance qualifiers for all regions, and that is something we want to avoid this year. With points being awarded to players only from that region and the last chance qualifier being region locked, we will be able to truly see who the best player from each region is."
Each of the four regional finals was a two-day event with a "Last Chance Qualifier" on day 1 and an 8-player tournament on day 2. Each regional final had a purse of $30,000 USD, which was distributed among the top 8. The grand prize of each regional final, besides qualifying for the Capcom Cup, was US$12,000.
Tournaments.
Four regional finals took place throughout the world between October 1 and November 19, 2017. These events were held (chronologically) in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and North America.
Europe.
The European regional finals of the 2016 Capcom Cup were the first of the four events, held during the Milan Games Week in Milan, Italy on October 1. The tournament was won by Benjamin "Problem X" Simon, scoring a 3–2 win over Olivier "Luffy" Hay and defeating Arman "Phenom" Hanjani 3–1 in the grand finals. Problem X' triumph at the European regional finals constituted his fifth victory in the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour, and the top three all qualified for the Capcom Cup.
Asia.
The Asian regional finals were held at the Southeast Asia Major at GameStart 2017 in Suntec City, Singapore, on October 14–15. The tournament was held side by side with the "Tekken" World Tour Asia Pacific Regional Championships and the "Windjammers" Asia Championships. The tournament was won by Tokido, playing using the character Akuma, defeating Li-Wei "Oil King" Lin in the grand finals.
Latin America.
The Latin American regional finals were held on Saturday, November 4 in São Paulo. Brazilian laws prevented Capcom from offering any prize money at the event. The tournament was won by Brazilian Dhalsim player Renato "DidimoKOF" Pereira Martins. While DidimoKOF only finished ninth on the Latin American leaderboards, he was added to top 8 bracket (along with eighth-ranked Moisés "Moise" Berrios) when the region's two top-seed players both withdrew. Saul "MenaRD" Mena and Thomas "Brolynho" Proença had already secured a Capcom Cup placing and had little to gain by competing in a tournament with no prize pot. DidimoKOF won against Dominican player Cristhoper "Caba" Rodriguez in the opening round and went on to defeat Moise and Bruno "DoomSnake507" La Grotta before facing Caba again in the grand finals. Here, DidimoKOF defeated Caba's Guile by a 3-2 margin and won his first major tournament.
North America.
The North American finals were hosted by Red Bull GmbH and held on November 18–19 at The Castle at Park Plaza in Boston, Massachusetts. The event, again titled "Red Bull Battlegrounds", was announced during a Capcom panel on the first day of Evo 2017. The Last Chance qualifier took the form of a 512-player open bracket tournament, featuring champions from regional events as well as the top amateur players from the online Red Bull Proving Grounds tournament. The Last Chance qualifier was won by Marcus "The Cool Kid93" Redmond, playing with the character Abigail. The Cool Kid93 was defeated by Victor "Punk" Woodley in the winner's quarterfinals and knocked out by Gustavo "801 Strider" Romero in the loser's bracket. 
Punk went on to win the tournament, defeating rising star Derek "iDom" Ruffin in the grand finals. Playing with the character Karin, Punk bested iDom's Laura three times, without taking a single loss.
Capcom teased the inclusion of the character Sakura in "Street Fighter V" by releasing cherry blossom-like confetti during the closing ceremony of Red Bull Battlegrounds.

Amalgamated Society of Enginemen, Cranemen and Firemen

The Amalgamated Society of Enginemen, Cranemen and Firemen was a trade union in the United Kingdom. It represented stationary engine drivers and cranemen in a wide variety of industries.
The union was founded in 1889, and within three years it had a membership of nearly 4,000 workers. However, it split in 1893, with nearly 1,000 members leaving to form the Northern United Enginemen's Association, which eventually joined the rival National Amalgamated Union of Enginemen, Firemen, Mechanics, Motormen and Electrical Workers. The remaining members renamed the union as the National Amalgamated Society of Enginemen, Cranemen, Boilermen and Firemen, and slowly rebuilt its membership, which peaked at 4,056 in 1906.
The union was based in North East England, but also had a significant membership in Scotland, particularly in the steel industry, where it appointed representatives to a board of conciliation. In England, it instead reached agreement to link its members' wages to those negotiated by the Amalgamated Society of Engineers.
The union tried to broaden its membership, in 1906 becoming the National Amalgamated Society of Enginemen, Cranemen, Boilermen, Firemen and Electrical Workers, but in 1912 decided to merge into the British Steel Smelters, Mill, Iron, Tinplate and Kindred Trades Association.

Garage (video game)

Garage (full title: GARAGE: Bad Dream Adventure; Japanese: ガラージュ) is a 1999 Japanese horror adventure video game developed by Kinotrope and published by Toshiba-EMI for Windows and Macintosh.
Production.
The game was designed by Japanese surrealist Tomomi Yuki Sakuba. It was also directed by Sakuba, produced by Masahiro Ikuta, co-produced by Akihiko Kawa, and programmed by Akiya Hayashi. 3D graphics were completed by Gengo Ito and Hiroki Watanabe, and music was composed by Tomonori Tanaka.
Sakuba began his interest in games with the title Cosmic Osmo, which he had played around 1990. After learning the game had been written on HyperCard, a software that comes for free with a Mac, he went to the library and began reading up how to program using the language. He made a few experimental projects including Hobbit's Great Adventure and Talking before setting his sights on making a full-fledged game.
When sketching out the design of the hero, Sakuba settled on a creature with an organic head on the body of the machine. He eventually decided to make this the design of all the characters. At least one poster was designed before the final poster was chosen for marketing. The official website for the game was founded in August 1995, and the director maintained a diary to update his progress.
The first release of this game was limited to 3,000 copies. The game's publisher, Toshiba-EMI, withdrew from CD-ROM publishing before further copies could be produced. Even in Japan, where the game was released, "Garage" is considered extremely rare, with only a few thousand copies in existence. When it appeared on the trading site Suruga-ya, it had an asking price of 300,000 yen.
It is currently available on the internet due to members of the 4chan's /vr/ board finding it on auction and putting together the money to purchase and preserve it. The game's creator has resistance to republishing it, firstly because the "game balance" has changed, and secondly he does not own the rights to it. A Garage Private Edition went on sales in mid-2007, and quickly sold out. With permission of Tomomi Yuki Sakuba, the game was a repackaging of the first release.
Plot and gameplay.
"Garage " is surreal and nightmarish point and click adventure set in a world full of biomechanical machines. The player takes control of a small robot who is tasked with finding an entity called the "shadow", and to escape the world in which they live. The game's graphics are pre-rendered and digitized.
Critical reception.
"Hardcore Gaming 101" deemed "Garage" a "profoundly uncomfortable game to look at", due to its unsettling nature.

Unnoticed Art

Unnoticed Art is the name of an organisation and a series of initiatives relating to a form of performance art that is executed in a non-theatrical context.
The term 'Unnoticed Art' was originally mentioned by Dutch artist Frans van Lent as a basic concept for the first Unnoticed Art Festival, which took place in Haarlem (The Netherlands) in 2014. The first Unnoticed Art Festival took place over two days, during which time thirty volunteers executed the performance scores created by thirty five artists. An iteration of the first Unnoticed Art Festival was commissioned by Zeppelin University in Friedrichshafen in Germany to form part of their 2014 "Sommerfest", the university's principal annual public engagement event. This used a selection of works devised for the Haarlem event. The second Unnoticed Art Festival took place in Nijmegen, 2016. The book Unnoticed Art was published in January, 2015. It contains an artistic statement by Frans van Lent and a catalogue of the Unnoticed Art Festival performances.
The 'Unnoticed Art' concept was further developed into a blog titled UnnoticedArt.com. The purpose of this blog is to present a wide variety of art works that relate to the artistic attitude of the field of Unnoticed Art.
In addition, TheConceptBank.org was initiated as a follow up from the first Unnoticed Art Festival, as an online free approachable database for performative concepts. Like the festival, TheConceptBank.org is based on the separation of concept creation (the artist) and execution (by visitors of the website). This website was launched in May 2014.
Another derivation of the 'Unnoticed Art' concept, The ParallelShow, is recognised as a series of impromptu performances of occasional collaborations from performance art practitioners. It started on 7 July 2015 as a singular occasion at the Kunsthal in Rotterdam, NL. This first ParallelShow was a cooperation of three Dutch artists: Ieke Trinks, Ienke Kastelein and Frans van Lent.
The concept of The ParallelShow took place unexpectedly at and around public exhibitions in art venues. It was never announced, no invitations are ever sent. Since the first show, The ParallelShow has also been initiated in nine other locations: 23 October 2015: at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands; 4 December 2015: at the M-Museumin Leuven, Belgium; 17 January 2016: at the Tate Britain, London, UK; 11 February 2016: at the Art Rotterdam art-fair, Rotterdam, Netherlands; 28 May 2016: at the Archeological Sites, Delphi, Greece; 5 June 2016: at the Huis van Gijn, Dordrecht, Netherlands; 18 September 2016: at the Institut Valencià d’Art Modern (IVAM), Valencia, Spain; 6 November 2016: at the Stasi Museum, Berlin, Germany; 8 January 2017: at the Met Cloisters, in New York City, New York, USA.
The ParallelShow never leaves any physical traces of its occurrence.
The ParallelShow book was published from Jap Sam Books, in The Netherlands, in March 2018.

Amalgamated Society of Leather Workers

The Amalgamated Society of Leather Workers was a trade union representing tanners and workers involved in making leather goods in the United Kingdom.
The union was founded in 1872 as the Leeds and District United Tanners' Society. Before the end of the century, it merged with the Leather Finishers' Society, Pickermakers' Society and United Grounders' Society, and in 1892 it changed its name to the Amalgamated Society of Tanners. In 1897, in an attempt to broaden its remit, it renamed itself as the Amalgamated Society of Tanners, Lacecutters and Beltmakers, and then in the 1900s adopted its final name.
The union long remained small, having 780 members in 1910. However, from 1912 it was led by a full-time general secretary, and it began to grow, reaching 12,099 members by 1954.
In 1971, the union merged with the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives, National Union of Glovers and Leather Workers and National Union of Leather Workers and Allied Trades, forming the National Union of Footwear, Leather and Allied Trades.

Cache coherent interconnect for accelerators

The cache coherent interconnect for accelerators (CCIX) protocol is the result of an effort of a joint group of computer, hardware and software component vendors: AMD, ARM, Huawei, Mellanox Technologies, Qualcomm and Xilinx.
Quotes from the homepage:
Current Status.
As of 2021, the future of CCIX as widely used interface to attach accelerators to servers in a cache-coherent fashion is doubtful. Many of the original members of the CCIX Consortium have instead opted to support the competing CXL standard, originally developed by Intel but then opened up, for the same purpose. This has led to processors originally announced with CCIX support, such as the AMD Epyc 7002, never actually shipping with that feature enabled. On the side of servers with ARM processors that also list CCIX in their specifications, such as the TaiShan 200 series from Huawei, many do not support the use of CCIX in practice, as it has not been fully validated.

Death of Kevin Hjalmarsson

Four-year-old Kevin Hjalmarsson was found dead in Arvika on 16 August 1998. Two brothers, then five and seven years old, were accused of murdering him and were claimed to have confessed. They were never convicted of a crime and from a judicial point of view are innocent.
Almost twenty years later, on 27 March 2018, all suspicions against both brothers were dismissed by Swedish police after a lengthy second investigation of the case.
Case.
The theory that police were working from in 1998, was that Kevin Hjalmarsson had been murdered with a stick which had been pressed against his throat ending in his suffocation, and that his body had then been left on the shore of Kyrkviken, part of Glafsfjorden lake in Arvika, from the presumed murder site. How his body was transported there has not been ascertained. There were no drag marks on the ground or on Kevin's body. First responders were called about a drowning at Glafsfjorden; an ambulance was dispatched at 21:22 and took the boy to hospital, where the police first inspected the body. It was initially speculated that a pedophile was the perpetrator. Police at Länskriminalen in Värmland made an analysis of the victim and his life up to his death. Two brothers, five and seven years old, were accused of the murder and allegedly confessed. During further investigations, psychologist Sven Å. Christianson, professor at the psychological institute in Stockholm, was called in. He was later criticized for his handling of the Thomas Quick case which he had also been involved in.
Treatment of the children.
In May 2017, the children came forward and stated that the police threatened and misled them into "confessing" the crime. “They almost threw it at me and would say ‘yes this has happened’. It was a lot of pressure that was the thing that made it so scary.” and “I remember that I was afraid of the police [but] if I did what they wanted, they would be happy and satisfied”, said Robin, who wants an apology.
The police had no recording of any confession, despite producing video and audio recordings of several other interrogations, which display serious pressure put on the boys to confess.
The boys were never convicted of the murder, so they were legally only regarded as suspects. Both boys were taken by social services for treatment and psychological help at a children's institution. The state imprisoned the children away from their parents and their friends and community for years, and tried several times to make the separation permanent. Years later, because all the state efforts failed, and no foster parents could be found, the children were returned to their parents.
Criticism of the investigation and media reports.
In Linda Kidane's documentary "Mordet på Kevin", broadcast on Sveriges Radio on 2 October 2015, the investigation was presented as a complete success and Kidane confirmed that the two brothers had murdered Kevin Hjalmarsson. After Janne Josefsson and other journalists started to look into the case, the documentary was removed from Sveriges Radio's official website.
In April 2017, "Dagens Nyheter" published an article that analysed the investigation of Kevin Hjalmarsson's death. The article highlighted several faults in the initial investigation, such as how interrogations of the two boys were conducted and how the boys were led through the crime scene. The two boys were subjected to extensive interrogations; this was deemed counterproductive by experts on children since it could lead to false confessions. Among those with a critical view were psychology professor Ann-Christin Cederborg, who said that the interrogations of the two boys were conducted against all rules concerning how an interrogation should be conducted. According to Cederborg, the methods used on the boys produced false confessions. The two children were subjected to threats and rewards depending on what they answered during interrogations. Neither the boys nor their parents had any legal representation during the entire investigation and interrogations. The alleged confessions that led to the closing of the investigation were never recorded on audio or video.
At the same time that "Dagens Nyheter" was investigating the case, a documentary by Dan Josefsson, "Fallet Kevin", was in production. The documentary showed parts of the video interrogations with the boys. The first episode of the three-part documentary was broadcast on Sveriges Television on the "Dokument inifrån" show in 2017, a few weeks after "Dagens Nyheter" published their first article about the case.
On 8 May, 2017, the district attorney decided to re-open the investigation into the case.
On 27 March, 2018, all suspicions against the two brothers were completely dismissed. Police also indicated that they now believed Kevin died of an accident.

Chery Tiggo 3

The Chery Tiggo 3, or originally the Chery Tiggo (), is a compact crossover produced by the Chinese manufacturer Chery Automobile since 2005 (debuted at the Shanghai Motor Show). It is the first product of the Chery Tiggo series. The original vehicle was facelifted in September 2010, and received the name change to Tiggo 3 and another facelift in 2014.
Overview.
Launched in 2005, the original Tiggo crossover has many styling cues which resemble other compact crossovers, mainly the Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CR-V.
2010 facelift.
In September 2010, Chery released the new 2011 Tiggo in China, essentially a facelift, built on the same platform. To the previous three engine options (1.6/1.8/2.0/L) is added the "1.6 s," a 1.6-liter with mechanical supercharger putting out at 5500 rpm and between 3,500 and 4,500 rpm. The 2010 facelift features a revised front end design and tail lamps.
2014 model rename to Chery Tiggo 3.
During the Beijing Auto Show in 2014, another facelift was launched for the model and renaming the Chery Tiggo to the Chery Tiggo 3, slotting the crossover as the entry model of the following Chery Tiggo crossover series. The market debut was May 2014, and the power train is a 1.6 liter engine producing 126hp and 160N·m. The transmission is a 5-speed manual transmission or a CVT.
2020 facelift.
The Chery Tiggo 3 received another facelift in 2019 for the 2020 model year. The model was dubbed the "millionth edition" and features golden trim on the interior. The powertrains are a 1.5 liter engine producing 116hp and 143N·m, and the transmission is a 5-speed manual transmission or a 2.0 liter engine producing 139PS and a maximum torque of 183N.m with a 5-speed automatic transmission unlike the previous version which had a 7-speed CVT transmission.
International Marketing.
Outside of China, the Tiggo 3 has also been assembled in Uruguay from as of late 2007, as a result of a partnership between Chery and Argentine company SOCMA. The goal was to export the car to Argentina and Brazil – 30% to 50% share of local components are needed to receive zero-tariff status inside the Mercosur. As of May 2015, the plant was permanently closed.
The Tiggo 3 has also been assembled from knocked down kits in Italy by the DR Motor Company as the dr5.
The 2.0 L version is also being assembled in Egypt as of late 2008 under the Speranza brand name. It is the latest addition to the assembly line of Egyptian assembled Chery cars (Eastar, A5 and A1) by Aboul-Fotouh (a former BMW dealer in Egypt).
Italy.
In Italy, it is assembled by the DR Motor Company and marketed as the DR5. It was introduced at the 2006 Bologna Motor Show and started the production in 2007, at the factory in Macchia d'Isernia.
It is available with three petrol engine options: a 1.6-litre, a 1.8-litre and a 2.0-litre, introduced in 2009.
The 1.6-litre petrol engine version (1,597 cc) has a maximum power output of at 6,100 rpm, a maximum torque of at 4,250 rpm and a top speed of . The 1.8-litre version (1,845 cc) has a maximum power output of at 5,750 rpm, a maximum torque of at 4,500 rpm and a top speed of . The 2.0-litre version (1,971 cc) has a maximum power output of at 6,000 rpm, a maximum torque of at 4,250 rpm and a top speed of .
Safety.
A 2011 Tiggo 3 was put to an offset crash-test by the ANCAP in October 2011 and scored a poor result of only two stars out of five. The rating comes as the side impact was not conducted, after Chery issued a recall to rectify some issues with side impact protection, and it was awarded the maximum score that it could achieve in the side impact test. However, even the maximum score in the side impact test would not have been enough to improve the car's safety rating beyond two stars.

Wiriyamu Massacre

The Wiriyamu Massacre or Operation Marosca was a massacre of civilian population of the village of Wiriyamu in Mozambique by Portuguese soldiers in December 1972. 
On 16 December 1972, the Portuguese 6th company of Mozambique Commandos killed the inhabitants of the village of Wiriyamu, in the district of Tete. Referred to as the 'Wiriyamu Massacre', the soldiers killed between 150 (according to the Red Cross) and 300 (according to a much later investigation by the Portuguese newspaper "Expresso" based in testimonies from soldiers) villagers accused of sheltering FRELIMO guerrillas. 
The action, named "Operation Marosca", was planned at the instigation of PIDE/DGS agents and guided by agent Chico Kachavi, who was later assassinated while an inquiry into the events was being carried out. The soldiers were told by this agent that "the orders were to kill them all", never mind that only civilians, women and children included, were found. All of the victims were civilians. 
Aftermath.
The massacre was recounted in July 1973 by the British Catholic priest, Father Adrian Hastings, and two other Spanish missionary priests. Later counter-claims have been made in a report of Archbishop of Dar es Salaam Laurean Rugambwa that alleged that the killings were carried out by FRELIMO combatants, not Portuguese forces. In addition, others claimed that the alleged massacres by Portuguese military forces were fabricated to tar the reputation of the Portuguese state abroad. Portuguese journalist Felícia Cabrita reconstructed the Wiriyamu massacre in detail by interviewing both survivors and former members of the Portuguese Army Commandos, the unit that carried out the massacre. Cabrita's report was published in the Portuguese weekly newspaper "Expresso" and later in a book containing several of the journalist's articles.

Lancashire Box, Packing Case and General Woodworkers' Society

The Lancashire Box, Packing Case and General Woodworkers' Society (LBPCGW) was a long-lived trade union in England, principally representing workers involved in making wooden boxes in the Manchester area.
History.
The union was founded in 1825 as the Manchester and Salford Trunk and Packing Case Makers' Friendly, Relief and Burial Society. Initially, all members had to have completed an apprenticeship in the trade, and to agree not to undertake piecework. Because most of the boxes made were for textile products, the union worked closely with those in the cotton trade, rather than other unions of woodworkers.
Membership of the union remained very small for many years: only 161 in 1849, and 360 in 1899. It tried to broaden its membership base, becoming the Manchester, Salford and Bolton Wood Packing Case Makers' Society in 1892, and unsuccessfully trying to recruit workers in the trade on lower wages in both 1900 and 1905. These workers instead formed a rival Manchester and Salford Wood Packing Case Makers (No 2 Society), which finally merged into the original union in 1910.
After World War I, the society again broadened its remit, accepting box makers from 1917, child workers from 1918, and workers undertaking piecework from 1919. This took membership over 1,000, and from 1918 the union was able to employ a full-time general secretary.
The cotton industry declined in Lancashire throughout the 20th-century, and the union began recruiting more workers involved in making packaging for heavy engineering products, such workers making up 90% of the total by the 1970s. It also recruited palette makers and some people involved in other areas of woodwork, and in recognition of this adopted its final name in 1945.
The union was still active in the mid-1980s, with around 500 members. In 1993, it merged into the Transport and General Workers' Union.

<doc id="56955328" url="?curid=56955328" title="Holocentric chromosome">
Holocentric chromosome

Holocentric chromosomes are chromosomes that possess multiple kinetochores along their length rather than the single centromere typical of other chromosomes. They have been described for the first time in cytogenetic experiments dating from 1935 and, since this first observation, the term holocentric chromosome has referred to chromosomes that: i) they lack the primary constriction corresponding to centromere observed in monocentric chromosomes; and ii) they possess multiple kinetochores dispersed along the chromosomal axis so that microtubules bind to chromosomes along their entire length and move broadside to the pole from the metaphase plate. These chromosomes are also termed holokinetic, because, during cell division, chromatids move apart in parallel and do not form the classical V-shaped figures typical of monocentric chromosomes. Holocentric chromosomes evolved several times during both animal and plant evolution and are currently reported in about eight hundred diverse species, including plants, insects, arachnids and nematodes As a consequence of their diffuse kinetochores, holocentric chromosomes may stabilize chromosomal fragments favouring karyotype rearrangements. However, holocentric chromosome may also present limitations to crossing over causing a restriction of the number of chiasma in bivalents and may cause a restructuring of meiotic divisions resulting in an inverted meiosis.
Evolution.
Holocentric chromosomes were described for the first time in 1935 to identify chromosomes with a diffuse kinetochore (or with a diffuse kinetochore activity) making these chromosomes able to bind to microtubules along their entire length. In the last decades, several studies assessed that the same behaviour during mitosis can be observed not only for holocentric/holokinetic chromosomes, but also for polykinetic chromosomes that contain numerous (but discrete) microtubule-binding sites, but the term “holocentric/holokinetic” is still used for both.
Before molecular methods became available, the presence of holocentric chromosomes was evaluated mostly using cytology and, considering that many species are difficult to study cytologically, it can be surmised that the true presence of holocentrism may be underestimated. In addition, there are several taxa, whose chromosomes are still uncharacterized, but their phylogenetic position suggests that they should have holocentric chromosomes. The presence of holocentric chromosomes has been up till now assessed in about 800 species, including insects, plants, arachnids, and nematodes suggesting that generally holocentric chromosomes originated by convergent evolution from ancestors possessing monocentric chromosomes. Interesting exceptions are represented by insects belonging to Oligoneoptera and Neoptera, whose monocentric chromosomes probably evolved from holocentric ancestor in two different and independent events. Evidence of convergent evolution suggests that holocentrism is adaptive, but the specific conditions under which holocentrism provided a selective advantage seem to be diverse for different taxa. Indeed, in phytophagous insects (such as aphids and lepidopterans) holocentrism could be related to the production by plants of compounds able to induce chromosomal breakages (clastogens), whereas in other cases, holocentrism allows facingDNA damage resulting from desiccation and/or other chromosome-breaking factors. Despite these differences, holocentric chromosomes present intrinsic benefits since chromosomal mutations, such as fissions and fusions, are potentially neutral in holocentric chromosomes in respect to monocentric ones. However, the hypothesis of holocentrism as an anticlastogenic adaptation have to be more systematically tested, including both controlled laboratory experiments and field studies across clastogenic gradients and large-scale phylogenetic analyses. At the same time, Nagaki et al. proposed that holocentrism can be easily acquired during plant and animal evolution by a slight difference in the kinetochore origin. In particular, they hypothesized that if the direction of kinetochore origin turns by 90° and occurs along the chromosome axes up to the telomeric regions, it is possible to “generate” holocentric chromosomes without any further step.
Structure.
A detailed molecular analysis of the structure of holocentric chromosomes is currently available for the nematode "Caenorhabditis elegans" only, whereas the presence of true holokinetic nature has been also confirmed in other taxa by the evidence that experimentally induced chromosome fragments continue to attach to the spindle and segregate correctly. For most of the species, data about holocentrism are related to the analysis of the behaviour of chromosomes during anaphase migration since holocentric sister chromatids migrate in parallel to the spindle poles, in contrast to monocentric ones in which pulling forces are exerted on a single chromosomal point and chromosome arms trail behind. As a consequence, chromatids of holocentric chromosomes move apart in parallel and do not form the classical V-shaped figures typical of monocentric ones. Moreover, if a holocentric chromosome is fragmented (for instance by X-ray irradiation), each fragment retains centromere activity and can segregate properly to the poles.
In different organisms.
Arthropods.
Among arthropods, the presence of holocentric chromosome has been reported in different species belonging to insects (Odonata, Zoraptera, Dermaptera, Psocoptera, Phthiraptera, Thysanoptera, Hemiptera, Trichoptera and Lepidoptera), scorpions (Buthoidea), mites and ticks of the superorder Acariformes and genus "Rhipicephalus" (Ixodidae), spiders (Dysderidae and Segestridae), millipedes and centipedes. Despite this widespread occurrence, most of the currently available data on holocentrism is related to aphid and lepidopteran species. In aphids, holocentric chromosomes have been deeply studied and their ability to stabilize chromosomal fragments has been associated to their phytophagous life style. Indeed, several plants produce chemicals able to induce DNA damage to pest insects. Nicotine, for instance, is a naturally occurring alkaloid found primarily in members of the solanaceous plant family (including "Nicotiana tabacum") that can cause replication fork stress resulting in various forms of DNA damage, including chromosomal fragmentations. Similar effects have been also reported by other plant-produced molecules, such as caffeine and ethanol. In view of their ability to favour the inheritance of chromosomal fragments, holocentrism has been associated to recurrent changes in the karyotypes of some aphid species and in particular in the peach potato aphid "Myzus persicae", where both inter- and intra-individual rearranged karyotypes have been also observed. Aphids also possess a constitutive expression of the telomerase coding gene so that they can initiate a "de novo" synthesis of telomere sequences at internal breakpoints, resulting in the stabilization of chromosomal fragments. Among non-polyploid animals, Lepidoptera exhibit the highest variance in chromosome number between species within a genus and notable levels of interspecific and intraspecific karyotype variability. Lepidoptera indeed tolerate chromosomal variations in view of their holokinetic chromosomes, which facilitate the successful inheritance of novel fission or fusion fragments. As a consequence, Lepidoptera can avoid the deleterious consequences of large-scale chromosomal fission and fusion. Nevertheless, they can sometimes tolerate heterozygosity for multiple rearrangements in hybrids between population with differences in their karyotype, raising questions about additional mechanisms that rescue fertility in chromosomal hybrids. In Lepidoptera, therefore, chromosome evolution is believed to play a role in reinforcing speciation. Comparing the genomes of lepidopteran species it has been also possible to analyse the effect of holocentrism in terms of rate of fixed chromosomal rearrangements. This approach evidenced in Lepidoptera two chromosome breaks per megabase of DNA per Million of years: a rate that is much higher than what observed in "Drosophila" and it is a direct consequence of the holocentric nature of the lepidopteran genomes. At a structural level, insect holocentric chromosomes have not been studied in details, but it is interesting to underline the absence of homologues of CENP-C and CENP-A, previously considered essential for kinetochore functioning in eukaryotes.
Nematodes.
The best known group of holocentric species can be found in the Secernentea class of the nematodes, which includes "C. elegans". other nematodes are usually described as holocentric because of their phylogenetic relationship to "C. elegans", but real karyotypic evidences are scarce or controversial. Nematode development is typically characterized by fixed lineages and a single inappropriate cell death, therefore, it has been suggested that holocentrism could avoid the disastrous consequences of unrepaired chromosome breakage events. The availability of several molecular and genomic resources allowed a detailed characterization of "C. elegans" holocentric chromosomes and in particular the structure of the kinetochore has been molecularly dissected. Current data suggest that "C. elegans" kinetochores form paired lines or plates on opposite faces of condensed mitotic chromosomes, where each line represents the diffuse kinetochore of a single chromatid. transmission electron microscopy of "C. elegans" chromosomes revealed that the kinetochore has a trilaminar structure very similar to that observed in monocentric chromosomes More than 30 different proteins have been identified as components of the "C. elegans" kinetochore and half of them was already known as functioning in the kinetochores of monocentric chromosomes. Among these, highly studied proteins include homologues of CENP-C and CENP-A, which are highly conserved structural component of the kinetochore in eukaryotes. Contrarily to what generally observed in monocentric chromosomes, in holocentric ones the preferential localization of centromeres within heterochromatic areas is missing together with the presence of specific DNA sequences that in "C. elegans" are not required for the assembly of a functional kinetochore. In this regard, it has been observed that holocentric chromosomes of nematodes are unique because they have a large number of satellites scattered throughout their genome, whereas no scattered satellites are found in the monocentric chromosomes of the nematode "trichinella spiralis." Interestingly, these satellite DNAs are not conserved in their sequences among species suggesting that highly repetitive DNAs may facilitate the formation of kinetochores in view of their repetitiveness rather than for their specific sequence. The absence of a localized centromere prompted several studies to identify proteins that are involved in the sister chromatid cohesion assessing that it is accomplished by a separate complex of conserved proteins, termed cohesin, that is composed of the core subunits Scc3, Smc1, Smc3 and Scc1. Interestingly, they play the same function in organisms with monocentric chromosomes with an exception related to the subunit Scc1, whose gene in addition to the Scc1 orthologue present three additional paralogous genes.
Plants.
In plants, holocentric chromosomes have been found in zygnematophycean algae, in the genera "Myristica" (Myristicaceae), "Chionographis" (Melanthiaceae), "Cuscuta" (Convolvulaceae) and "Droseraceae," in the species "trithuria submersa" (hydatellaceae), "prionium serratum" (thurniaceae) and, among higher-plants, in many genera belonging to families cyperaceae and juncaceae, including the snowy woodrush "luzula nivea" (juncaceae), the most well-studied holocentric plant. In "Luzula" spp, the centromeric activity is localized simultaneously at several evenly spaced sites along each chromosome and chromosomes can be fragmented naturally or by irradiation into smaller (but viable) chromosomes. The presence of rearranged karyotype does not affect fitness, as assessed by studies reporting that "Luzula" hybrids with parents possessing smaller and larger chromosomes showed the smaller chromosomes aligned and paired with the larger ones. Similarly, in plants belonging to the genus "Carex", differentiation of the karyotype has been demonstrated to correlate with genetic divergence within species, among populations within species and within populations suggesting that, as previously reported in Lepidoptera, holocentric chromosome rearrangements contribute to genetic differentiation at different evolutionary scales in "Carex" evolution and speciation. In plants it has also been suggested that the diffuse kinetochore of holocentric chromosomes may suppress the meiotic drive of centromeric repeats and its negative consequences. In particular, the expansions (or contractions) of centromeric repeats may lead to a larger (or smaller) kinetochore, which attracts more (or fewer) microtubules during meiosis. This hypothesis, which correlates the presence of holocentric chromosomes with centromere drive suppression, is very intriguing but it only explains the evolution of chromosomal holocentrism in meiosis and not in mitosis and this is not trivial considering that some species with holocentric chromosomes may present a restriction of kinetochore activity during meiosis. Similarly to what previously reported for "C. elegans", in "L. elegans" centromeres are not made by centromere-associated retrotransposons nor centromere-associated satellite DNAs, but cenH3 proteins seem to be associated with a centromere-specific chromatin folding rather than with specific centromeric DNA sequences. Conservation of elements between mono- and holocentric chromosomes is not limited to centromeric proteins, but it is also extended to epigenetic marks. Indeed, the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of serine 10 or serine 28 of H3 (that is typically enriched in peri-centromeric regions of monocentric plant chromosomes) occurs uniformly along the "Luzula" chromosomes. As previously described in aphids, "L. elegans" possesses a rapid and efficient "de novo" telomere formation based on a telomerase-mediated healing process that is active immediately after chromosomal damage by irradiation of chromosomes. Newly formed telomere repeats were cytologically detectable 21 days after irradiation in about 50% of cases with a complete healing of telomere after 3 months favouring the fragment stabilization and karyotype fixation.
Meiosis.
In the late 19th century, van Beneden (1883) and Boveri (1890) described meiosis for the first time through a careful observation of germ cell formation in the nematode "Ascaris". These observations, together with several further analyses, evidenced that canonical meiosis consists of a first division (called reductional division) that involves the segregation of chromosomal homologs resulting in the reduction of chromosome number and a second division (defined equational division) consisting in the separation of sister chromatids. A general rule for meiosis is therefore: first homologues, then sisters.
However, the understanding of the reductional division in meiosis of "Ascaris" sp. has been obtained studying the holocentric chromosomes which, in many other taxa, follow a reverse order of meiotic division. Indeed, as reported in several nematodes, in insects belonging to Hemiptera and Lepidoptera, in mites and in some flowering plants species with holocentric chromosomes generally present an inverted meiotic sequence, in which segregation of homologs is postponed until the second meiotic division. Furthermore, in most cases of inverted meiosis the absence of a canonical kinetochore structure has been observed, together with a restriction of the kinetic activity to the chromosomal ends. These changes are related to the peculiar cohesion occurring in tetrads of the holocentric homologous chromosomes during meiosis that impose obstacles to the releases of chromosomes involved in multiple crossing over events. In the holocentric chromosomes of "C. elegans" female meiosis, this problem is circumvented restricting crossing over to form only a single chiasma per bivalent and triggering the redistribution of kinetochore proteins along the bivalent axis forming meiosis-specific cup-like structures that uniformly coat each half bivalent but are excluded from the midbivalent region. During anaphase I, "C. elegans" homologous chromosomes are segregated to the poles by microtubule pushing from the midbivalent regions towards the poles. Differently to what reported in "C. elegans", other organisms with holocentric chromosomes, including both plants and insects, circumvent this problem segregating sister chromatids during meiosis I leading to the term inverted meiosis in which the order of reductional and equational division is inverted in respect to canonical meiosis. In this case therefore the separation of homologous chromosomes follows the segregation of sister chromatids. However, in order to have a successful inverted meiosis, it is necessary that a bipolar orientation of sister kinetochores occurs, together with their attachment to microtubules from opposite spindle poles in meiosis I. This allows the segregation of sister chromatids to opposite poles in anaphase I (equational division), but it requests a mechanism to align and pair homologous chromosomes during the second meiotic division. Interestingly, the presence of inverted meiosis can also facilitate the proper chromosome segregation in hybrids from parental species with differences in their karyotypes or derived by populations with rearranged karyotype allowing rescue of the fertility and viability of hybrids and promoting a fast karyotype evolution and possibly chromosomal speciation, as reported in Lepidoptera.

Fannie Eller Lorber (1881 – June 9, 1958) was a Russian-born philanthropist and community activist. She founded the Denver Sheltering Home for Jewish Children, later known as the National Home for Jewish Children.
She was born in Geishen, a shtetl near Odessa, and came with her family to the United States in the early 1890s, settling in the West Colfax neighborhood of Denver, Colorado in 1896.
In 1902, she married Jacob Lorber, who owned a show business and later served in the state legislature. They had two sons.
In 1907, with her friend Bessie Willens, she founded the Denver Sheltering Home to look after the children of tuberculosis victims, many of whom came to Denver because of its sunshine and clean air. She served as its president for the rest of her life. In 1920, she set up a national fundraising office in New York City and established a chain of auxiliaries across the country to help support the Home. When a vaccine was developed in the late 1940s which virtually eliminated tuberculosis, the home began treating children with chronic asthma.
Lorber died in Denver at the age of 76.
She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2006.
The Home eventually merged with the National Jewish Hospital and Research Center to become National Jewish Health.

Calders &amp; Grandidge

Calders &amp; Grandidge is a specialist timber manufacturing and treatment company in Boston, Lincolnshire that is the UK's largest (and main) manufacturer of wooden telegraph and (electricity) transmission posts. The company holds a Royal Warrant for the supply of Pressure Treated Timber products to HM the Queen.
History.
Calders Ltd was incorporated by Sir James Charles Calder CBE (28 December 1869- 22 August 1962) of Milnathort, who was knighted in the 1921 Birthday Honours; he died in 1962 aged 92; he was Timber Controller at the Timber Supply Department of the Board of Trade from 1919–20; he was a friend of the American ambassador, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., and his son; from 1940-41 he was Director of Home Timber Production.
A site in Boston was established in 1896 alongside Boston Dock, and moved to the 46-acre London Road site in the 1930s. Calders Ltd was incorporated on 3 February 1919 at Dunkeld in Scotland; the company was formed to acquire the business of Sir James Calder's grandfather, which was formed in 1820, and another company George Wood &amp; Sons of Brandon, Suffolk.
It made railway sleepers for the Railway Executive (British Rail) and pit props for the Coal Mining business, by 1919 the company had also opened depots at Middlesbrough, Rotherhithe, Newcastle and Port Talbot, allowing expansion into what were the new markets, such as railway sleepers, pit props and fencing.
John MacKenzie Calder was a director in Calders Ltd but resigned in 1957 when it was taken over by Great Universal Stores. So the Calder family connection with the timber trade ended after some 140 years.
A booklet published circa 1947 lists an impressive range of products obtainable from the Calders Group: turnery, barrel staves, scaffold boards, factory paving blocks, sleepers and crossings, pit props and mining timber, constructional and building timbers: telegraph poles and telegraph arms, beer and mineral water cases and crates, imported and home grown softwoods and hardwoods, boxes for export, horticulture and agriculture, floorings – parquet, strip and block, wagon bottoms and sheeting’s, railway keys and ferrules, fencing and gates.
In 1945 the company took over James Grandidge Ltd, forming Calders &amp; Grandidge on 24 March 1959. In this same year Calders and all its subsidiaries were acquired by Montague L Meyer Ltd. In 1986, the company was awarded a Royal Warrant for Preserved Timber Fencing.
In the 1980s it was a main supplier of wooden joists and rafters for house builders, known as the Calders system.
Ownership.
On 3 May 1948, Calders Ltd was floated on the London Stock Exchange. In 1957 Calders Ltd was purchased by Great Universal Stores and then by Montague L Meyer Ltd in 1959. In 2000 it became part of the multi-national French construction products company Saint-Gobain as part of its purchase of Meyer International PLC

Gunilla Lagerbielke

Edit Gunilla Margareta Lagerbielke (1926–2013) was a Swedish textile artist who exerted considerable influence on arts and crafts in Sweden as a result of her heading Konstfack and chairing the Swedish Arts Grants Committee. She is also remembered for the textile works she created with her husband Lars Johanson which were exhibited in Gothenburg in 1970.
Biography.
Born on 24 July 1926 in Stockholm, Edit Gunilla Margareta Lagerbielke was the daughter of Ernst Gustaf Lagerbjelke (1897–1932) and Signe Margaretha Hamilton (1902–1989). After her well-to-do father died when she was only five, she was brought up by her mother in the centre of Stockholm. On matriculating from the girls high school, she studied textile art at the college which soon became known as Konstfackskolan.
From 1951 to 1956, Lagerbielke taught textile art at the Arts and Crafts School in Copenhagen. Thanks to a grant from the Swedish-America Foundation, she then went on a nine-month study trip to the United States with her newly-wedded husband, Lars Johanson, whom she had met while studying at Konstfack. On returning to Sweden, they worked together as Lars and Gunilla Johanson, presenting a large exhibition of their work in 1970 at the Röhsska Museum in Gothenburg titled "Textila bilder och figurer" (Textile Pictures and Figures). Her marriage did not survive as Johanson became increasingly dominant, preventing her from creating her own works. After their divorce in 1975, Lagerbielke found a position with the Stockholm Lekmiljörådet (Play Environment Council) where she developed support for pre-school children, later heading the department (1972–78).
In 1978, she was appointed rector of Konstfack, where she remained for the next twelve years. Thereafter she received many government assignments, including the modernization of art colleges and the development of art in public places. In the 1990s, she became deputy head of the Swedish Art Grants Committee and head of the Swedish Visual Arts Foundation. In particular, she was effective in developing a more international approach to the work of these bodies, improving Sweden's worldwide image.
In later life, Lagerbielke returned to textile art, this time creating embroidery designs. She exhibited at the Galleri Inger Molin in 2004, 2006 and 2012.
Gunilla Lagerbielke died in Stockholm on 15 August 2013. She is survived by her daughter Erika Lagerbielke (born 1960), a designer who works mainly with glass.

Sabucia gens

The gens Sabucia was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned in imperial times. The most illustrious of the family was Gaius Sabucius Major Caecilianus, who obtained the consulship in AD 186. Other Sabucii are known from inscriptions.
Origin.
The historian Anthony Birley indicates that the Sabucii were of Etruscan origin.
Branches and cognomina.
The Sabucii used a variety of personal cognomina. The only family surname known from inscriptions is "Major", typically given to the elder of two or more siblings; the cognomen "Magnus", great, borne by one of the other Sabucii, might suggest a connection to this family. "Sabinus" usually designated someone of Sabine ancestry, but might also refer to one who resembled a Sabine in his manner or habits. "Aper", found in one inscription of the consul Gaius Sabucius Major, refers to a wild boar.

Ange Muracciole

Ange-Marie Muracciole (12 March 1835 – 2 July 1904) was a French public works contractor and politician. He was Senator for Corsica from 1892 to 1894, and again from 1903 to 1904.
Early years (1835–92).
Ange-Marie Muracciole was born on 12 March 1835 in Muracciole, Corsica.
His parents were Bartolomeo Muracciole (1808–58) and Maria Costa.
On 19 January 1858 he married Madeleine Pantalacci (born 1838) in Muracciole.
Muracciole became a public works contractor.
He had gained a solid reputation when work began on the Panama Canal in 1881, and was invited to participate.
He returned to Corsica when the work was suspended.
He was mayor of Belgodère and general councilor of Vezzani.
On 29 July 1886 his second marriage was to Rose Marie Casanelli d'Istria (1864–1931) in Muracciole.
Senator (1892–94).
On 21 August 1892 Muracciole ran for election to the Senate in a by-election following the death of François Morelli.
He was elected in the first round by 382 votes against 372 for Vincent Farinole.
He joined the democratic left group.
Due to illness he was forced to seek leave in 1892 before speaking in the senate.
In the general elections of 7 January 1894 he was defeated by Farinole, who won 409 votes to 272 for Muracciole.
Later career (1894–1904).
Muracciole returned to private life, running his business and acting in his local political posts.
The journal "Le Républicain" (Bastia), founded as a daily in 1895, reappeared on 12 April 1898 to support the Republican candidates Emmanuel Arène, Muracciole, Marius Giacobbi, Colonel Astima and Toussain Malaspina in the 8 May 1898 legislative elections.
In 1901 Muracciole became general councilor for the canton of Vico, replacing Dominique Cristinacce.
He was also a censor at the Ajjacio branch of the Bank of France.
Muracciole ran once more for election to the senate on 4 January 1903, and decisively defeated Farinole by 581 votes to 113.
His health again prevented him from spending much time in the Senate.
He died in office on 2 July 1904 in Ajaccio at the age of 69.
The village of Muracciole is distinguished by a Gothic Revival château built in the late 19th century by Ange Muracciole.
It is a rare example of this type of architecture on Corsica.
The house was built by Muracciole after he returned from the Panama Canal.

Presidency of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski

The presidency of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in Peru began with his inauguration on Peru independence day (28 July 2016) and ended with the president's resignation following a corruption scandal on 23 March 2018.
In June 2016, Kuczynski won over Keiko Fujimori of Popular Force with 8,596,937 votes, 50.12 percent of the votes. However, in those same elections, she achieved a majority in the Congress while that the ruling group of Peruanos Por el Kambio drew a few congressmen.
From the beginning, the relations between the Legislative and the Executive were strained, and on 15 September 2017 the Congress denied the vote of confidence to the then president of the Council of Ministers Fernando Zavala, with which Kuczynski had to appoint a new cabinet. This included five new ministers, and was chaired by the second vice president and also congresswoman Mercedes Aráoz Fernández. His government has also been marked by the Odebrecht case. Kuczynski himself was the subject of two impeachments in Congress for its conflicts of interest with that company, which in a first attempt did not prosper. Soon after, it pardoned former President Alberto Fujimori, who was serving a 25-year sentence for crimes against humanity. The decision triggered protests in Lima and eight other cities as well as the resignation of three of its ministers and the criticism of a broad spectrum of personalities. In a national political crisis, which finally led to a second process of presidential vacancy, promoted by the left and supported by the Fujimoristas of Popular Force. But a few days before the Congress debated the vacancy request, the Fujimoristas revealed videos and audios that showed that government operators, including a minister of state, were negotiating with a Popular Force congressman to buy their vote against the government vacancy, in exchange for works for your region. The next day, the president sent his letter of resignation to Congress, which was accepted on 23 March 2018. That same day the engineer Martín Vizcarra was sworn in as new president, for being in the line of succession as he was the first vice president of the Republic.
Transition period.
The second round of voting took place on 5 June 2016, which Kuczynski won by a narrow margin. A few days after the ballot, he confirmed that Alfredo Thorne Vetter would assume the position of Minister of Economy and Finance. On 28 June, the National Elections Board presented the credentials of Kuczynski as president and Martín Vizcarra and Mercedes Aráoz as vice-presidents, in a ceremony held at the Municipal Theater of Lima. On Sunday, 10 July, he announced that Fernando Zavala Lombardi would be the president of the Council of Ministers and days later, both announced the members of the first ministerial cabinet.
Tenure of power.
The inauguration ceremony was held on 28 July 2016, at the Legislative Palace. It counted with the presence of King Juan Carlos I of Spain, the Latin American presidents: Mauricio Macri, Horacio Cartes, Michelle Bachelet, Enrique Peña Nieto, Juan Manuel Santos and Rafael Correa; Vice presidents Alvaro Garcia Linera, Raúl Fernando Sendic, Óscar Ortiz Ascencio and Jafeth Cabrera Franco; the Brazilian Foreign Minister, José Serra. Among the international delegations was the US Trade Representative, Michael Froman, along with the Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America, Mari Carmen Aponte, and the Assistant Secretary of State for Security Affairs, William Brownfield; also the former Japanese economy minister, Toshihiro Nikai.
In his first speech given to the nation from the headquarters of the National Congress, Kuczynski presented six topics, which, in his view, were of an urgent nature: water and drainage for all Peruvians, quality Public Education, service of public health sensitive to the patient, formalize the country, build infrastructure and development, and complete intolerance for corruption, discrimination, and crime.
Political climate.
First ministerial cabinet.
On 28 July 2016, the Ministers of State were sworn in as part of the inauguration ceremony. The swearing-in, unlike previous occasions in which it had been held in the Golden Hall of the Government Palace, was held this time in the courtyard of honor, outdoors and in full view of the public.
The ministerial cabinet consisted of: Fernando Zavala (Prime minister); Víctor Ricardo Luna Mendoza (Foreign Affairs); Mariano González Fernández (Defense); Alfredo Thorne (Economy and Finance); Carlos Basombrío Iglesias (Interior); Marisol Pérez Tello (Justice and Human Rights); Jaime Saavedra (Education); Patricia García Funegra (Health); José Manuel Hernández Calderón (Agriculture and Irrigation); Alfonso Grados Carraro (Labour); Bruno Giuffra (Production); Eduardo Ferreyros Küppers (Foreign Trade and Tourism); Gonzalo Tamayo (Energy and Mines); Martín Vizcarra (Transport and Communications); Edmer Trujillo Mori (Housing, Construction and Sanitation); Ana María Romero-Lozada (Woman and Vulnerable Populations); Elsa Galarza (Environment); Jorge Nieto Montesinos (Culture); and Cayetana Aljovín (Development and Social Inclusion).
Of the members of the cabinet, six were economists (Zavala, Thorne, Saavedra, Tamayo, Giuffra and Galarza). Some of them had previously held a ministerial position: Zavala had been head of the economy in 2005–2006 during the mandate of Alejandro Toledo; Romero-Lozada was Minister of Women twice, also during the mandate of Alejandro Toledo; Ferreyros was in Foreign Trade in 2010 (during Alan García's second tenure); and Saavedra was Minister of Education since 2013 (during Ollanta Humala's mandate. On the other hand, the lack of equity in terms of gender was questioned, since it was made up of 14 men and 5 women.
Vote of confidence.
On 18 August 2016, Prime Minister Fernando Zavala appeared before the plenary of the Congress of the Republic of Peru to request a vote of confidence from his cabinet, in accordance with the constitutional norm. In a speech that lasted two hours, he presented in four blocks the main issues to consider: opportunities, social investment, water and infrastructure; citizen security and fight against corruption; employment, formalization and reactivation of the economy; and bringing the state closer to the citizen. He highlighted the progress made by each of the last five governments, including that of Alberto Fujimori. Although there were doubts that a Congress, which had an absolute majority opposed to the government (represented by the 73 members of Popular Force of a total of 130) could easily grant the vote of confidence, after a long debate that lasted 21 hours, it was approved, with 121 votes in favor, 2 against and one abstention.
Granting of legislative powers.
Another moment of tension between the Executive and the Congress came when the former asked the latter to grant powers to legislate on economic matters, citizen security, anti-corruption, water and sanitation, and the reorganization of Petroperú. On 30 September 2016, after a six-hour debate, Congress granted the Executive Branch legislative powers for a term of 90 days. Voting was done by topic and not by block. On 7 January 2017, at the expiration of the 90-day period, Prime Minister Zavala announced the publication of 112 legislative decrees.
Bribery scandal.
Carlos Moreno served as Presidential Adviser on health issues since the beginning of the government. He was, apparently, a very trustworthy person of Kuczynski. So, when he resigned on 4 October 2016, he caught the attention of the media. Kuczynski said at first that the resignation of his advisor was due to personal reasons and his heavy workload. However, Moreno himself explained that the reason was because they had recorded their conversations in the Government Palace and that they were involved in a corruption case.
On 9 October, the television program Cuarto Poder broadcast an audio in which Moreno commented on negotiation for a clinic to sign an agreement with the Archbishopric of Lima and, thus, be able to access an agreement to serve patients insured in the System Integral de Salud (SIS). "It's the negotiation, I have the people who do it, I have the patients," Moreno said, as heard in the audio record. "That is our mine. You do not know how much money we are going to win," he added. Although Moreno was separated from the government as soon as the "negotiation" was exposed, the scandal shook an administration that was barely three months since initiation.
Resignation of Minister Mariano Gonzalez.
On 27 November 2016, a report from a news program revealed that Defense Minister Cosme Mariano González Fernández maintained a sentimental relationship with an advisor from his office, which he presumably had favored with a promotion. The minister denied having favored his partner and said in his defense: "What I have committed is a fact of love. I have fallen in love."
The next day, González submitted his resignation to the position, which was accepted by Prime Minister Zavala. A week later, he was appointed as Jorge Nieto Montesinos, until then head of the Ministry of Culture headed by the actor and film director Salvador del Solar.
Censorship of Minister Jaime Saavedra.
Education minister Jaime Saavedra, who held that position since the Humala administration in 2013, was censored by Congress and forced to resign.
The opposition to the government, represented in the Congress by an overwhelming Fujimorist majority allied with the APRA party, began to question the work of the Minister of Education, Jaime Saavedra.
First, it was related to the organization of the 2019 Panamerican Games in Lima, despite having been announced in 2013 (shortly before taking office as minister), not enough had been done in terms of infrastructure construction.
Then, a Sunday television program launched a report in which he denounced that the minister's trusted staff had made a deviation from a budget of 150 million soles destined for the purchase of computers. The opposition in Congress announced that it would interpellate the minister to demand that he give an account of his administration, particularly in relation to the alleged corruption. President Kuczynski publicly supported his minister and argued that the campaign against him originated with a group of legislators associated with private universities who wanted to make changes in the University Law to favor their interests.
On 7 December 2016, Saavedra was questioned at the Congress, whose campus he voluntarily attended to answer a list of 11 questions. After eleven hours of exhibitions and debate, in which the minister accepted that there were irregularities in the purchases made by his sector by people who had "betrayed his trust", the Fujimorist block announced that it would submit a motion of censure against the minister, because, to his see, he was politically responsible and had not responded satisfactorily to the interpellatory statement. Saavedra told the press that he would not resign before the censorship request.
On 15 December, the minister's censorship debate was held, obtaining as a final result 78 votes in favor, none against and no abstention (due to the fact that the benches of Peruvians for Change and Open Front, against the censorship, they retired of the hemicycle before the voting). Saavedra was given a period of 72 hours to present his resignation letter.
On 17 December, Saavedra resigned and the following day she was sworn in by educator Marilú Martens.
Secret bilateral meetings between Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and Keiko Fujimori.
In December 2016, following an initiative by Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani, the leader of Popular Force, Keiko Fujimori, and President Kuczynski met to talk at the archbishop's residence. A similar meeting took place in July 2017, after Fujimori invited the president to talk. This time, the meeting took place at the Government Palace. In view of the subsequent events, the second vice-president Mercedes Aráoz considered that it was an error to believe in Fujimori's demands for dialogue, since, apparently, since the first moment his intention had been to undermine the government and seek the vacancy of the president.
Interpellation of Minister Martin Vizcarra.
After months of study, the government decided to carry out the project of the construction of the International Airport of Chinchero, signing on 3 February 2017 an addendum to contract modifications with Kuntur Wasi, the consortium had won the award the project in 2014. This was a work that had decades of waiting and was longed for by the people of Cusco, who threatened to get up if it were paralyzed; it seems that the political and social solution prevailed more on the part of the government than on technical issues.
President Kuczynski and the Minister of Transport and Communications Martín Vizcarra defended the addendum, stating that it was the best option for the State and citizens. It was argued that the State saved $590 million (which was the amount of debt that was held with the company).
However, since the Congress, specifically on behalf of Congressman Víctor Andrés García Belaunde, a vehement opposition arose, considering the addendum as harmful to the interests of the State. A photo published in the Correo newspaper, dating from June 2016, showed Vizcarra in a thankful meeting of the Peruanos Por el Kambio party for the contributors to his campaign, where Carlos Vargas Loret de Mola, president of the Kuntur Wasi consortium, appears.
For Garcia Belaunde, that would be the link that would explain the alleged government favoritism toward consortium, so it Vizcarra branded as a "traitor" and demanded his resignation. Harassed by critics, Vizcarra said that the state would no outlay of money to Kuntuhuasi to wait for the final report. On 1 March 2017, Popular Action presented a statement against Vizcarra, seconded by representatives of Popular Force, Frente Amplio and the APRA.
However, following the onslaught of El Nino, in which some parliamentarians moved to the affected areas to care for the victims, Congress decided to suspend "until further notice" the interpellation to Vizcarra, which was scheduled for 23 March and consisted of 83 questions. Amended the El Niño phenomenon, on 5 May, a group of 35 congressmen presented a new motion to question the minister.
On 11 May, the motion was approved with 71 votes and the interpellation was scheduled for 18 May 48 in which the minister answered a list of 83 questions for more than three hours. In the Congress, it was agreed to wait for the report of the Comptroller's Office, indicated for Monday, before proceeding to the vote of censorship.
But before that happened, Vizcarra submitted his resignation as minister, after announcing in a television interview that he was going to cancel the contract and the addendum for the construction of the Chinchero airport, in view of not having had acceptance in the Congress or the Comptroller's Office. Indeed, moments later, the comptroller general Edgar Alarcon presented his report on the contract Chinchero where recommended legal action against ten officials (six of MTC, two of the MEF and two Ositran) for alleged irregularities in the addendum for the company Kuntur Wasi.
With Vizcarra, there were already two ministers who left office by Congress in less than a year, after being questioned (the other was Saavedra in Education); What's more, it was the most prestigious government ministers. For this reason, Zavala criticized the majority caucus in the Congress (of Fujimorism), arguing that "one thing is political control, another is the abuse of power. It is one thing to control, another is to obstruct. "
Succeeding as the First Vice President of Peru and following after Kuczynski's resignation, Vizcarra assumed the Presidency of Peru. Vizcarra has mentioned that he will get his revenge soon.
Ministerial changes (May 2017).
On 25 May 2017, Bruno Giuffra, who until then was the Minister of Production, left that position and swore as Minister of Transport and Communications, replacing Martín Vizcarra. While the official congressman Pedro Olaechea happened to occupy the Ministry of the Production. The swearing-in ceremony of both was held in the Golden Hall of the Government Palace.
Audio Thorne-Alarcón.
On 28 May 2017 the television program Panorama revealed some transcripts of an audio in which the Minister of Economy Alfredo Thorne was holding a conversation with the Comptroller General of the Republic Edgar Alarcón, dated 17 May, days before the delivery of the report of the Comptroller on the addendum to the Chinchero Airport contract. On 4 June, some excerpts of the audio were published, and later, on the claim that it was being published in a biased manner, it was published in full, on 11 June.
In this conversation, the interlocutors talk about additional funds for the Comptroller's Office that should be approved by the Ministry of Economy, and about the report that the Comptroller was about to draw on the Chinchero Contract. In a part of it we hear that Thorne tells Alarcón: "Now everything depends on you: if Chinchero passes, we are doing well; if Chinchero is taken down, it is going but badly ". After the audio was broadcast, Thorne was accused of exerting political pressure on the comptroller on behalf of the Executive, conditioning the increase in the budget of the Comptroller's Office in exchange for a positive report in what refers to Chinchero.
The plenary session of the Congress, held on 15 June (that is, several days after the announcement of the audio), summoned Thorne to appear urgently in the floor to give his explanations about his conversations with the comptroller. But the minister excused himself from attending his busy work schedule, announcing that he would attend the Congress's oversight committee on 16 June, as scheduled.
Given this, the chairman of the audit committee, Hector Becerril, announced that the summons to the said working group was without effect and that only his immediate presence was expected before the plenary session of the Congress, and that in case of not attending, it could be cause for censorship. Thorne then confirmed his attendance at the Congress on the 16th, where he made an exhibition that lasted ten minutes. He denied the accusation of conditioning the budget increase of the Comptroller's Office in exchange for a positive report on the Chinchero contract, and unless President Kuczynski had instructed him to condition the comptroller. After a debate among the congressmen, the opposition caucuses they raised the minister to renounce his position; otherwise, they would promote a motion of censure against him.
On 19 June, Thorne formalized before Congress a question of confidence to continue in office, something he had requested in his speech on the 16th. The issue of trust was debated on 21 June by the full Congress, where the caucuses of Popular Force, APRA, Acción Popular, Frente Amplio and Alliance for Progress voted against, adding 88 votes in total. There were only 11 votes in favor of giving him the confidence (of the members of the ruling party) and 2 abstentions. Before this, Thorne resigned from the Ministry of Economy, being replaced by Prime Minister Fernando Zavala, who was sworn in the following day, although his role as president of the Council of Ministers.
Interpellation of Minister Basombrío.
On 21 June 2017, Interior Minister Carlos Basombrío Iglesias appeared before the full Congress to answer the interpellatory list of 39 questions. This occurred immediately after Congress denied confidence to Minister Thorne. The exhibition of Basombrío lasted three hours and not only answered the questions, but made announcements about his management. Once the presentation was over, the parliamentary debate began and continued until the following day. Although the opposition groups to the government questioned some of their responses, none raised their censure nor asked for their resignation.
Ministerial changes (July 2017).
On 27 July 2017, three changes were made official in the ministerial cabinet: the government congresswoman Ana María Choquehuanca assumed the Ministry of Women; Until then Minister of Development and Social Inclusion Cayetana Aljovín became the owner of Energy and Mines; while Fiorella Molinelli was appointed Minister of Development and Social Inclusion. The appointment of the latter generated some criticism from the opposition in Congress, because as an official of the Ministry of Transport and Communications had signed the contract addendum for the construction of the Chinchero airport.
Second "Address to the Nation".
On 28 July 2017, after one year of the government, it began celebrating the traditional Mass and Te Deum in the Cathedral of Lima; After that, the president arrived at the headquarters of the Congress, where he gave his second message to the nation, for national holidays, which lasted an hour and 15 minutes. According to the Political Constitution, the president on this date must give a message to the nation in which to account for what has been done and present their future plans. Kuczynski began by mentioning the most serious problems he faced during his first year in office, such as the El Niño Costero disaster and the Lava Jato scandal, which cost 2% of GDP. He emphasized that National Reconstruction will boost the national economy. It also presented five bills, which address the obtaining of buildings required for the execution of infrastructure works; the creation of an urban transport authority for Lima and Callao; the reform of the conformation and requirements to be a member of the National Council of the Magistracy; the promotion of projects for wastewater treatment through public-private partnerships; and the strengthening of the labor inspection system through Sunafil. Contrary to the message given at the beginning of his mandate, his second message to the nation was received with little expectation and disbelief among several of the leading political and economic analysts. After the message, Kuczynski walked to the Government Palace, where he was held a tribute to the people who helped during the disaster caused by the coastal El Nino.
Interpellation of Minister Martens and the cabinet crisis.
On 17 August 2017 the congresspeople of Popular Force filed a motion of interpretation against the Minister of Education Marilú Martens who was in negotiations with the representatives of the teachers, in search of the solution to a prolonged teacher strike. On 25 August 2017 the plenary session of the Congress of the Republic approved, with 79 votes in favor, 12 against and 6 abstentions, to make said interpellation . The votes in favor were from the bench of Popular Force, APRA, Frente Amplio and Acción Popular. It was set as the date of the interpellation on 8 September. The minister responded to a list of 40 questions, mainly about the teachers 'strike that still persisted. Martens acknowledged deficiencies in facing the teachers' strike, but assured that his management would not reverse the recognition of meritocracy within the teaching profession.
On 13 September, the Popular Force bench announced that it would submit a motion of censure against the minister, as it considered that it had not responded satisfactorily to the questions of interpellation. Faced with this threat of censorship (which would be the second against an Education minister in less than a year), Prime Minister Fernando Zavala asked Congress for a question of confidence for the full ministerial cabinet; in other words, a renewal of the vote of confidence that had been given to him at the beginning of his administration.
From the Congress this request was criticized, pointing out the fact that Zavala showed solidarity with a minister who was questioned, endangering her entire cabinet, and even more so, when the motion of censure had not yet been made official. It was also said that the "renewal of trust" was something that the Constitution did not contemplate.
But anyway, the Board of Spokespersons of the Congress summoned Zavala at four o'clock on the afternoon of 14 September to support her request for confidence. Zavala presented himself to the plenary session of the Congress with the ministers and presented his request in 12 minutes; his argument focused on the government's intention to defend the educational policy that was intended, according to him, to undermine the education minister's censure. Then came the parliamentary debate. The question of trust was debated for 7 hours and voted on at dawn on the 15th.
There were 77 parliamentarians who voted against Zavala's request, while 22 supported it and 16 abstained. Kenji Fujimori was the only one of the 71 representatives of Popular Force who adhered to the request for trust. All the others opposed. The representatives of the Broad Front also voted against the confidence. Thus the crisis of the cabinet occurred.
Members of Popular Force considered that all the members of the cabinet had to resign, but finally the opinion prevailed that only the prime minister was obliged to resign, and that the rest of the ministers could remain, except those who were questioned, as was the case of Minister Martens.
Second cabinet minister (Aráoz).
On 17 September 2017, the second vice president and congresswoman Mercedes Aráoz Fernández was sworn in as President of the Council of Ministers of Peru and with it joined five new ministers: Claudia Cooper Fort (Economy), Idel Vexler (Education), Enrique Mendoza Ramírez (Justice and Human Rights), Fernando D'Alessio (Health) and Carlos Bruce (Housing). The new head of the cabinet was sworn in with the 18 ministers in a ceremony held in the Court of Honor of the Government Palace.
On 12 October, Mercedes Aráoz appeared before the plenary session of the Congress to request a vote of confidence from her ministerial cabinet. His exhibition lasted two hours. After a parliamentary debate that lasted until one o'clock in the morning of the following day, 83 congressmen (from the opposing blocs of Popular Force, Alianza para el Progreso, Partido Aprista Peruano and Acción Popular, voted in favor of the motion of confidence). as of the official Peruanos Por el Kambio) and against 17 (of Frente Amplio and the nascent New Peru bench). The next step for the Executive will be to request legislative powers from the Congress, set for 7 December 2017.
First process to impeach the president.
On 13 December 2017, Lava Jato Commission President Rosa Bartra released information from the Odebrecht company in which it claimed that Westfield Capital, an investment banking advisory firm, founded and directed by Kuczynski had carried out seven consultancies for Odebrecht between November 2004 and December 2007 for 782,207 million dollars, that is, coinciding with the time when Kuczynski had been Minister of Economy (2004–2005) and President of the Council of Ministers (2005–2006).
The information also revealed that another company, First Capital, constituted by the Chilean Gerardo Sepúlveda (partner of Kuczynski), He had done advisory services for Odebrecht between 2005 and 2013, receiving US$4,043,941 as payment for his services. It was also known that both advisory firms shared the same tax address.
The information was seriously compromising for the president, who had always denied having had relations with the Odebrecht company, and because the payments to his personal consulting company had been made when he was Minister of State (something prohibited by constitutional norm for typifying conflict of interest), and even worse when they came from a company like Odebrecht, which had paid bribes to win the concession of works precisely under the government of Toledo, when Kuczynski had been minister. The president then announced that he would receive the Lava Jato Commission on 22 December, but this gesture was considered delayed, after repeatedly insisting on responding only in writing.
Opposition to the government, led by Popular Force, demanded the resignation of Kuczynski. and threatened to kick him out of the presidency if he did not. Frente Amplio, on the other hand, stated that the vacancy should proceed directly. At midnight on 14 December, he denied the accusations and said he would not resign his position. "I am here to tell you: I am not going to abdicate to my honor or my values or my responsibilities as president of all Peruvians," he said in a message to the nation.
In his defense, he assured that he had no relationship with the company. First Capital, which was the exclusive property of Sepúlveda, and that only one of the payments mentioned had to do with him, the one dated in 2012, when he was no longer Minister of State; and that regarding Westfield Capital, although he recognized that it was his sole proprietorship, he affirmed that he was never under his direction and administration while he was Minister of State, and that the contracts dated at that time had been signed by Sepúlveda, his partner. He also pointed out that all payments to his company were legal, duly registered, billed and banked.
Kuczynski's explanations did not convince the opposition, and he was accused of continuing to lie, especially in relation to the fact that he had left Westfield. Capital when he was minister, when, according to public records, he always figured as the director of that company. In this regard, Kuczynski argued in its defense the concept of the "Chinese wall", expression used in business to refer to when the partner or owner has no contact or receive information about the management of the company. But this argument did not convince its opponents either, since being a sole proprietorship, there was no way that it would have remained alien to the management of it. Faced with the refusal of the president to resign, several of the opposition caucuses of the Congress then proposed to submit their position to the vacancy. The Frente Amplio filed a motion to request the vacancy to be debated in the plenary session of the Congress. The congresspersons of Popular Force, Apra and Alianza para el Progreso joined the request and thus exceeded the 26 signatures needed to proceed with the process. Once the motion was approved, the debate began at 4 and 38 in the afternoon of 15 December and lasted until the night.
The opposition legislators who introduced the motion cited a moral inability to denounce that the president lied in the statements he gave on his ties with the Brazilian company. On the other hand, the congressmen demanded that due process be followed, reproaching the fact that the opposition proceeded with unusual speed and that several of its members had already decided to vote the president without having heard his defense. They also questioned the fact that a single report from Odebrecht was considered sufficient evidence, which would openly disregard the investigation that demanded such a delicate and far-reaching case.
According to the regulations, the vacancy request was required to be accepted for acceptance. vote of 40% of able congressmen. As 118 congressmen were present, only 48 votes were needed, which was widely exceeded, as they voted 93 in favor and 17 against; the latter were, for the most part, those of the ruling party caucus.
Once the vacancy request was approved, Congress agreed that on Thursday, 21 December, at 9 o'clock in the morning, Kuczynski should present itself, with or without its lawyer, the plenary session of the Congress to make his discharges, giving him all the necessary time; then it would proceed to debate and finally vote to decide the presidential vacancy, needed for this 87 votes of the total of 130 congressmen.
On the day, Kuczynski went to Congress to exercise their defense, accompanied by his lawyer Alberto Borea Odría. The defense began with the speech of the president himself, who reiterated in denying that he had committed any act of corruption. Then came the defense of Borea, described as brilliant, which was at the core of his argument that the request for vacancy was an exaggeration because you could not accuse a president of the Republic without demonstrating evidence of his "permanent moral incapacity." It considered that the imputed crimes had to ventilate first in the investigating commission, before drawing hasty conclusions. He also rejected that Kuczynski has repeatedly lied about his relationship with Odebrecht, since the events in question had occurred 12 years ago and he did not have to keep them in mind.
Once Borea's address was over, the congressional debate began, which lasted fourteen hours. Voting for the vacancy took place after eleven o'clock at night, with the following result: 78 votes in favor, 19 against and 21 abstentions. One of the benches, the one of New Peru, retired before the voting, adducing that they would not be lent to the game raised by the fujimoristas. Since 87 votes were needed to proceed with the vacancy, it was dismissed. The entire People's Power caucus voted in favor of the vacancy, with the exception of 10 of its members, headed by Kenji Fujimori, who abstained, and who thus decided the result. The rumor spread that this dissident group had negotiated its votes with the government in exchange for the presidential pardon in favor of Alberto Fujimori, its historical leader imprisoned for ten years.
The Fujimorist majority opposition.
The governance crisis was originated by the existence of a majority opposition caucus in Congress, which continuously confronts a weakened Executive Power, which it accuses of ineffectiveness to solve the country's problems. Until September 2017, that is to say, in one year and two months of government, Fujimorism had led to the fall of five ministers. Several analysts considered that what Fujimorism was looking for was to bring down the country's institutions and control the Public Prosecutor's Office. Constitutional Court and the Presidency of the Republic. All this would point to shield its leader Keiko Fujimori, seriously involved in the Odebrecht case.
Pardon of Former President Alberto Fujimori.
On 24 December 2017, the president granted a humanitarian pardon to Alberto Fujimori, who had been imprisoned for 12 years, with a sentence of 25 years for crimes of human rights violations (La Cantuta and Barrios Altos cases). Kuczynski called on young people not to be carried away by hatred and turn the page, to lead the country towards "a fraternal Bicentennial of peace and prosperity." The government assured that the pardon had been decided for purely humanitarian reasons, in view of the various physical ills afflicting the former president of the Republic, confirmed by reports of a medical board.
However, a strong suspicion arose that the pardon would have been the result of a furtive pact of the Kuczynski government with the sector of the Fujimorist bloc that had abstained during the vote for the presidential vacancy and that in that way had prevented it from concrete this. The pardon also motivated the resignation of the official congressmen Alberto de Belaunde, Vicente Zeballos and Gino Costa; of the Minister of Culture Salvador del Solar and of the Minister of Defense Jorge Nieto Montesinos; as well as the accomplishment of diverse marches in Lima and the interior of the country in protest against the pardon.
Since the beginning of the crisis, Minister Carlos Basombrío had also presented his resignation, which was accepted by Kuczynski on 27 December 2017, being replaced by retired Police General Vicente Romero Fernández.
The writer Mario Vargas Llosa considered the pardon as a "betrayal" of Kuczynski to the democratic electorate that had elected him in rejection of autocratic Fujimori. Fujimori, who days before the pardon had been admitted to a clinic for complications in his health, was discharged on 4 January 2018 and thus could, for the first time, move freely.
Kuczynski also announced its desire to form a new ministerial cabinet, which he called "the Cabinet of Reconciliation", which according to him, should mark a new stage in the relationship between the Executive and the Legislative.
The Cabinet of Reconciliation (Aráoz, second phase).

On 9 January 2018, the president swore to his cabinet that he called the "Cabinet of Reconciliation." Mercedes Aráoz was presided over and eight ministerial changes were made, the most important renewal so far in the government. Cayetana Aljovín, who held the portfolio of Energy and Mines, went on to Foreign Affairs. The new ministers who were sworn in were: Jorge Kisic (Defense), José Arista Arbildo (Agriculture), Lieneke Schol (Production), Jorge Meléndez Celis (Development and Social Inclusion), Ángela Grossheim (Energy and Mines), Abel Salinas Rivas ( Health), Javier Barreda (Work) and Alejandro Neyra (Culture). The ceremony was held in the Great Hall of Government Palace.
Two of the new ministers (Barreda and Salinas) were apristas militants, being expelled from their party when knowing that they would integrate the cabinet, to demarcate like this any collaboration with the government. Meléndez is an official congressman, representing Loreto. Kisic is a retired general of the FAP. Neyra is a diplomat, writer and former director of the National Library. The other ministers are linked to the business sector. Kuczynski has also highlighted that it is a cabinet that represents the diversity of Peru and that it will seek reconciliation with dialogue.
Internal faction disputes in Popular Force.
On 30 January 2018, the disciplinary committee of Popular Force advised to expel Congressmen Kenji Fujimori, Bienvenido Ramírez and Maritza García from their parliamentary caucus, the same ones who, along with six other congressmen, had abstained from voting in favor of the Presidential vacancy. The next day Kenji Fujimori and the 9 parliamentarians in question agreed to present their irrevocable resignation to their caucus, thus giving themselves the most important schism within Fujimorism since their appearance on the political scene. Kenji Fujimori justified this decision by citing the repeated abuses that he had been receiving from the People's Power leadership only because he had opted for the country's governability and reconciliation; when asked if he would form a new caucus, he said he would wait for the Court's ruling on the unconstitutionality suit filed against the law that prohibits the formation of new parliamentary groups in Congress.
On 1 March 2018, Kenji Fujimori announced his departure from Popular Force, following the revelation that the Odebrecht company had contributed one million two hundred thousand dollars to the party for the 2011 electoral campaign.
Second process to impeach the president.
In January 2018, the Frente Amplio caucus put forward a new request for a presidential vacancy, with the cause of the pardon to Alberto Fujimori, which allegedly had been negotiated and granted illegally. This did not prosper, given the lack of support from Popular Force, whose votes were necessary to carry out such an initiative. Under that experience, the leftist groups of Frente Amplio and Nuevo Peru promoted another vacancy motion, concentrating exclusively on the Odebrecht case, arguing that new indications of corruption and conflict of interest had been discovered by Kuczynski when he was Minister of State in the Government of Toledo. This time they won the support of Popular Force, as well as other groups like the Alliance for Progress, thus gathering the 27 minimum votes needed to present a multiparty motion before the Congress of the Republic, which was held on 8 March 2018.
On 15 March, the admission of this motion was debated in the plenary session of the Congress, with the result being 87 votes in favor, 15 votes against and 15 abstentions. The motion received the backing of all the parties, except for Peruvians for the Kambio and non-grouped congressmen, among them, the three ex-oficialistas and the Kenji Fujimori bloc. The Board of Spokespersons scheduled the debate on the presidential vacancy request for Thursday, 22 March.
A confidential report from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) sent to the Public Ministry and the Lava Jato Commission of Congress was leaked to public knowledge. This 33-page document revealed that from the companies and consortiums linked to the Odebrecht Group, transfers had been made to Westfield Capital, the sole proprietorship of Kuczynski, for $1,893,841, that is, one million more than what was known up to the moment. The leak of this report, which is presumed to have been made by the Lava Jato Commission chaired by Rosa Bartra, would have been intended to further dent the credibility of the President of the Republic, although it added little to what was already known. But the deadly blow to Kuczynski came a few days later.
"Kenjivideos" scandal.
On 20 March 2018, the Popular Force bench showed evidence that the government was buying the support of congressmen to vote against the presidential vacancy, a rumor that had already circulated during the first process. It was a set of videos showing the conversations that legislators Bienvenido Ramírez and Guillermo Bocángel (from the bench of Kenji Fujimori) had made to try to convince congressman Moisés Mamani (from Puno) not to join in supporting the presidential vacancy. In one of the videos, Kenji Fujimori is seen in a meeting with Mamani, which also includes Bienvenido Ramírez. The latter makes a series of offers to the parliamentarian from Pune to enable him to streamline projects and projects for his region, in exchange for joining his group and supporting Kuczynski. In another video you see Bocángel talking about the administrative control of the Congress, once they access the Board. And in a third video, you see Alberto Borea Odría, Kuczynski's lawyer on the subject of vacancy, explaining to Mamani about aspects of that process and giving him the telephone number of a minister of state.
A few hours later, the Fujimoristas gave the final thrust, by broadcasting a set of audios, in which the Minister of Transport and Communications, Bruno Giuffra is heard offering works to Mamani in exchange for his vote to avoid the vacancy. The press highlighted a phrase from Giuffra in which he says: "Compadre, you know what the nut is and what you are going to get out", presumably referring to the benefits Mamani would get if he voted against the vacancy.
Resignation of President Kuczynski.
Main article: Resignation of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski
The revelation of those videos and audios caused much commotion in the political environment. Until then, it was expected that the vote to achieve the vacancy would be very tight and that even Kuczynski could again succeed as had happened in the first process. But the kenjivideos determined that several congressmen who until then had manifested their abstention (among them the three ex- oficialistas) they folded in favor of the vacancy, and thus they made it known openly. Faced with the foreseeable scenario that awaited him in the debate scheduled for the Congress on the 22nd, Kuczynski opted to renounce the Presidency of the Republic, sending the respective letter to Congress, and giving a message to the Nation transmitted at two forty in the morning. afternoon of 21 March 2018."I believe that the best thing for the country is for me to resign from the Presidency of the Republic. I wish not to be an obstacle for our nation's efforts to find the path of unity and harmony that is so critically needed and has been denied to me. I do not want the country or my family to continue suffering with the uncertainty of recent times (...) There will be a constitutionally ordered transition."- Kuczynski, in his message of resignation to the Presidency of the Republic. Lima, March 21, 2018.The Board of Spokespersons of the Congress, although rejected the terms of the letter of resignation of Kuczynski, which considered nothing self-critical, accepted the same and scheduled for 22 March, from four in the afternoon, a debate in Congress to evaluate the resignation, the same one that continued the next day. Although a section of congressmen on the left argued that Kuczynski's resignation should not be accepted and that Congress should proceed to vacancy due to moral incapacity, the majority of congressmen considered that they should accept to close the page at once. When the preliminary text of the resolution of the Congress in which Kuczynski was pointed out to him as a "traitor to the fatherland" became public, he announced that he would withdraw his letter of resignation if that qualification was maintained. The Board of Spokesmen decided then to omit that expression. The resignation was accepted with 105 votes in favor, 12 against and 3 abstentions. Moments later, Martín Vizcarra, newly arrived from Canada, was sworn in as the new constitutional president of the Republic.
The Odebrecht case.
On 21 December 2016, a document was published by the US Department of Justice that revealed that Brazilian construction company Odebrecht had paid bribes to public officials in 12 countries (including Peru) to win public works tenders. It would be the biggest corruption scandal in Latin America.
In the case of Peru, according to judicial investigators, Odebrecht would have paid approximately 29 million dollars in bribes to officials, which generated more than 143 million dollars in benefits, although it is likely that the amount of bribes and bribes been much older. This would have occurred between 2005 and 2014, corresponding to the governments of Alejandro Toledo (2001–2006), Alan García (2006–2011) and Ollanta Humala (2011–2016). Since November 2016, the Prosecutor's Office in Peru had been investigating the case known from Brazil as Operation Lava Jato.
Upon hearing the news, President Kuczynski said he would support everything necessary for the investigation. He denied being involved in the corruption scandal when he was prime minister of the Toledo government.
Statements by Jorge Barata and Marcelo Odebrecht.
Marcelo Odebrecht (former president of the construction company) and Jorge Barata (executive director of the company in Peru), welcomed the award-winning or effective collaboration to reduce their sentences and are collaborating with the justice of Brazil and Peru. The declarations of these characters have compromised Peruvian presidents and officials, about the receipt of bribes to favor the Brazilian company in the bidding for public works, as well as "ghost" contributions to finance the electoral campaigns of various candidates (the latter would come to configure the criminal figure of money laundering).
Marcelo Odebrecht answered the questions of the Peruvian prosecutors in May and November 2017, about the contribution of three million dollars that he made for the election campaign of Ollanta Humala in 2011, as well as about his annotations in his agenda, where he mentioned some politicians like Keiko Fujimori.
Barata, in his first declarations, revealed the delivery of 20 million dollars as a bribe to President Alejandro Toledo for the South Interoceanic Highway. Then, before a team of Peruvian prosecutors, on 27 and 28 February 2018, he answered several questions, revealing the contributions made by the Odebrecht company to the presidential candidacies of 2011 (Humala, Keiko, Kuczynski), detailing the amounts and intermediaries.
Main stakeholders.
The most resounding case is that of former President Alejandro Toledo, who would have received 20 million dollars, delivered by Barata, in exchange for the concession of sections II and III of the South Interoceanic Highway. The capture of Toledo was ordered, who is currently fugitive in the United States. He was opened an extradition booklet, sustained by influence peddling, collusion and money laundering to the detriment of the State. On 15 March 2018, the Supreme Court declared the request for extradition admissible, which was approved by the Executive Power, through the Council of Ministers.
Another accusation was the payment of bribes in the tender for Line 1 of the Lima Metro, which occurred under García's second government, when Enrique Cornejo was Minister of Transport and Communications. They were accused Jorge Cuba, former deputy communications minister; Miguel Navarro, former official of the Vice Ministry of Communications; and Mariella Huerta, former director of the bidding committee of the Lima Metro; Edwin Luyo, member of the same committee. Cuba, Navarro and Luyo were captured and imprisoned, while Huerta is fugitive. The former volleyball player Jéssica Tejada, a couple from Cuba, was also arrested for having lent her name to one of the offshore accounts where the bribe money was deposited.
The revelations of other former Odebrecht officials also involved two regional governors: Félix Moreno Caballero (Callao) and Jorge Acurio Tito (Cuzco). Moreno has been related to receiving a bribe of 4.2 million dollars for the concession to the Brazilian company of a section of the Costa Verde, for which he was given preventive detention. Acurio is accused of having agreed to a 3 million dollar bribe to favor the Brazilian company with the work Via de Evitamiento in Cuzco. The Office of the Prosecutor issued 18 months of preventive detention. In relation to this case, the lawyer José Zaragozá, syndicated as an intermediary in the payments, has also been arrested, who accepted the award. Both Acurio and Moreno appealed the mandate of preventive detention. The Appeals Chamber confirmed the preventive detention of Acurio, but revoked the one of Moreno, who happened to face the process in restricted appearance (7 June 2017).
Among those involved in the scandal is the former president Ollanta Humala and his wife Nadine Heredia, because Barata said he had given the latter three million dollars, at the request of the Brazilian Workers Party, political affinity to the Nationalist Party of Humala. That amount would have been destined for the electoral campaign of 2011, in which Humala was elected president. On 13 July 2017, the First Preparatory Investigation Court, headed by Judge Richard Concepción Carhuancho, approved the request for 18 months of preventive detention against Humala and his wife, presented by the money laundering office, which alleged risk of escape or asylum claim. The next day, Humala was interned in the Diroes prison (Ate), and Nadine Heredia went to the Virgen de Fátima prison, attached to the women's prison of Chorrillos.
In investigations is the ex-president Alan García, whose initials of his name appear on the agenda of Marcelo Odebrecht, as revealed by a journalistic publication. In its statements to Peruvian prosecutors in November 2017, Odebrecht confirmed that these acronyms of AG correspond to Alan García, although without linking it to any bribe payment.
In November 2017, the former mayor of Lima Susana Villarán, who was already in the process of investigation, was directly related to the case by the Brazilian consultant Valdemir Garreta, an aspiring collaborator, who told the Peruvian prosecutor's office that the Odebrecht companies and OAS financed the campaign for the No to the revocation in 2013 for an amount of three million dollars, and that in that transaction served as an intermediary municipal official José Miguel Castro, right arm of the then mayor of Lima. All that revelation has been confirmed by Jorge Barata himself. Although, in the opinion of some, Villarán would be given preventive detention, he was only prevented from leaving the country for eight months.
The Kuczynski investigation.
President Kuczynski was also included in the investigation of the Lava Jato case, for having been prime minister under the Toledo government (when the interoceanic highway was awarded to the Odebrecht company) and for the alleged financing he received from the government. The same company in its campaign for the 2011 and 2016 presidencies. In this regard, Kuczynski sent in October 2017 an official letter to the Lava Jato commission of the Congress in which it explained the matters on which it could be consulted, and that it would respond in writing.
Kuczynski's refusal to receive the Commission in person (up to six times), was due to the fact that, according to his version, when in February 2017 he received the Supervisory Commission (chaired by Héctor Becerril), he had received a series of abuse. However, the Fujimorista bloc demanded that the explanations be given in person and even pushed for a bill so that a president of the Republic is obliged to appear before congressional commissions, which, according to constitutional experts, has no support in the Constitution.
In November 2017, it transpired that Marcelo Odebrecht would have revealed some advice that Kuczynski provided to his company. Although Kuczynski flatly denied having had a working relationship with the Odebrecht company, Congress was once again required to receive the Lava Jato Commission in person.
In December 2017, the president of the Lava Jato Commission, Rosa Bartra, insisted that Kuczynski respond in person before the commission, giving it as a sort of ultimatum. Given the repeated response of Kuczynski that only respond in writing, Bartra made the disclosure of payments that the Odebrecht company had made between 2005 and 2006 to the consulting companies Westfield Capital and First Capital, linked to President Kuczynski, then Minister of State. It should be noted, however, that none of these payments were bribes, but that they were all legal; What was questioned was the fact that Kuczynski received them through his sole proprietorship (Westfield Capital) as a Minister of State, something constitutionally forbidden. Pushed by the revelations, Kuczynski agreed to have received a consulting payment for the H2 Olmos project, from the same Brazilian company. This only increased political tension due to its supposed contradictions.
Crisis came about because of the presidential vacancy that Kuczynski was able to overcome, at first, in December 2017. Then, when a second vacancy request was submitted, in March 2018, he had to resign from the presidency shortly before the vote in Congress, due to the scandal of the kenjivideo (see more details in the Political section).
Days before his resignation from the presidency, Kuczynski finally received the Lava Jato Commission on 16 March 2018, where he responded to a seven-hour interrogation. In addition to the matter of contractual relations between his consulting firms and the companies of the Odebrecht group, he was questioned about the financing of his 2011 election campaign, when he applied for the group Alianza por el Gran Cambio.
No sooner did Kuczynski resign as president, when he was prevented from leaving the country and the raid of his two homes was ordered (one in San Isidro, and the other in Cieneguilla).
The Keiko Fujimori case and Popular Force.
Already before the outbreak of the Odebrecht scandal, Keiko Fujimori and his Popular Force party were in the investigation because of the financing of their electoral campaign. A judicial process was opened to Keiko Fujimori, for alleged money laundering. The matter was further complicated for the former presidential candidate when it was revealed that in the agenda of Marcelo Odebrecht's cell phone, there was a very compromising phrase: "Increase Keiko for 500 e eu fazer visita". It was said that the figure referred to five hundred thousand dollars and that it was a contribution for his electoral campaign of 2011.
In November 2017, a team of Peruvian prosecutors questioned Marcelo Odebrecht in the city of Curitiba, about the case of Keiko Fujimori. The businessman confirmed that he had contributed to Keiko's presidential campaigns, although he explained that it was Barata who knew the exact amounts.
In February 2018, Barata revealed that she had contributed one million two hundred thousand dollars in favor of Keiko's electoral campaign in 2011, and that the intermediaries of that delivery had been Jaime Yoshiyama, Augusto Bedoya and Ricardo Briceño, the latter's representative of the CONFIEP.
El Niño Coastal Storm.
In early 2017, the north coast of Peru began to suffer the ravages of the so-called El Niño, which became accentuated in February. This is an atypical phenomenon, which occurs almost unannounced. Unlike the typical El Niño phenomenon, which impacts the entire Pacific basin, affecting even climate on a planetary scale (and whose last devastating exponents have been those of 1983 and 1997–98), El Niño is focalized, since it only affects the coast of Peru and Ecuador. A similar event occurred in 1925, which was the prelude to the Niño of 1926, which is considered the third mega -child in importance of the twentieth century, only below those of 1983 and 1997–98.
Characteristic of this phenomenon are the intense rains. These are caused by the warming of the sea off the north coast of Peru, up to 29 °C, when the normal is 22º or a little more; this causes the water to evaporate, forming clouds that then precipitate as rain on the coast. The rains cause both landslides or mudslides, and river overflows or floods, severely affecting the populations settled in its path.
Areas affected.
The most serious damages were verified in the departments of northern Peru: Tumbes, Piura and Lambayeque, which have endured intense rains, sometimes accompanied by thunderstorms, causing floods, damage to homes and destruction of crops. Several kilometers of roads were also damaged and a lot of unused bridges. Other affected departments have been La Libertad and Áncash. In Trujillo, several streets were flooded by water and mud; the mother channel of Chavimochic, from where the drinking water that is distributed to the city comes, suffered a rupture, reason why this service was suspended. Huarmey was completely flooded by the overflow of the river of the same name. In the province of Lima, the overflows of the rivers Chillón, Rímac, Huaycoloro and Lurín, affected several riverside localities, the most affected being: Cajamarquilla, Carapongo, Huachipa and Chosica.
The potable water supply of the Peruvian capital was also affected, since the waters of the rivers were loaded with garbage and mud, the task of capturing the water resource became more complicated, so the Drinking Water and Sewage Service of Lima (Sedapal), restricted the service for several days. Other provinces of Lima also suffered havoc: Huarochirí, where the most affected town were Santa Eulalia, and Cañete, whose capital, San Vicente de Cañete, suffered flood of the Río Pócoto.
Further south, the departments of Ica and Arequipa also suffered the ravages of the rains and the overflows of the rivers. In January, the activation of the streams caused the flooding of the town of La Tinguiña (Ica) . The city of Arequipa suffered restrictions in the potable water service, due to the high turbidity recorded in the Chili River, which made treatment system.
Government assistance.
To respond to the emergency situation, the National Emergency Operations Center (COEN) was installed, headed by Defense Minister Jorge Nieto Montesinos (6 February 2017). President Kuczynski announced on 17 March that a priority of 2,500 million soles would be allocated to deal with disasters; also that facilities would be granted to municipalities and regional governments to execute and expedite the works for the improvement of disaster areas; as well as flexibility to a series of ministries so that they can reallocate the budget items, being the sectors that would have the largest budget those of Defense, Sanitation and Housing, Agriculture, Transport, Production, Health and Interior.
Nine ministers were also designated to organize aid to the different affected regions: Alfonso Grados (Tumbes); Marilú Martens (Piura); Eduardo Ferreyros (Lambayeque); Cayetana Aljovín (La Libertad); Marisol Pérez Tello (Áncash); Ana María Romero-Lozada (districts of Rímac, Cercado and San Juan de Lurigancho); Salvador del Solar (Huachipa and Carapongo); Gonzalo Tamayo (Chosica and Santa Eulalia); and Elsa Galarza (south boy to Mala).
As a sign of solidarity towards the victims, the government created the slogan "One force", which began to be used by institutions and people to call for help from citizens. The portal unasolafuerza.pe (#UnaSolaFuerza) was launched to provide up-to-date information on the emergence of the hurricanes and rains that affected the country.
Reconstruction with changes.
In mid-April 2017 the ravages of the coastal Niño began to diminish. By then, the number of those killed in the entire territory of Peru was 113, the victims 178 701 and the people affected 1,049,083. The affected homes totaled 237,906. According to Minister Gonzalo Tamayo, the impact of the phenomenon was worse that of an earthquake, since 1,500 kilometers of simultaneous emergency were activated.
On 5 May 2017 it was announced that the authority in charge of the reconstruction would be Pablo de la Flor. The title of his position is: Executive Director of the Authority for Reconstruction with Changes. According to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, about 20 billion soles (about 6 billion dollars) is expected to be spent on reconstruction.
When questioned by the regional governors about the delays in the Reconstruction projects, Pablo de la Flor resigned his post at the end of October 2017. He was replaced by the economist Édgar Quispe.
Social Issues.
Social protests.
Protest against the national school curriculum.
At the beginning of 2017, the implementation of the National School Curriculum 2017, triggered the formation of a self-proclaimed collective with my children do not get involved (CMHNTM) to change it based on the argument that it promotes homosexuality.
In response, the Minister of Education Marilú Martens said that in the new contents the Curriculum seeks respect for diversity in society, promoting gender equality, in the sense of equal opportunities, rights and responsibilities for men and women without distinction.
Other advocates of the Curriculum noted the fact that the CMHNTM's criticisms stem from a confusion of concepts, about biological sex (male and female), gender identity and sexual orientation. These responses and other similar ones given by government spokesmen were considered arrogant by the leaders of the CMHNTM collective, since, according to them, they take advantage of values as precious as equality and respect for men and women, to smuggle and overlapping the "gender ideology" in the Curriculum.
As a protest, the CMHNTM organized a march on 4 March 2017, which was held nationwide, bringing together a total of 68,340 people throughout the country, of whom 25,000 were in Lima. Soon after, Minister Martens announced the realization of some changes in the School Curriculum, to specify concepts that could be confusing to parents, but making it clear that the gender equality approach remained unchanged.
Magisterial strike.
One of the promises of Kuczynski's election campaign was the increase of teachers' salaries at all levels. In March 2017, by Supreme Decree No. 070-2017-EF, the increase for the appointed teachers was made official, passing the minimum wage from 1,554 soles to 1,780 soles, with the added promise that by March 2018 it would rise to 2000 With regard to those hired, it was decided that the increases would begin in November 2017.
However, protest voices rose in the teachers' union, which argued that Kuczynski's promise had been that the increase of 2,000 soles would be from 2017 and not from 2018, and that by 2021 it should reach 1 UIT, that is, 4,050 soles. Other requirements of the union were the payment of the social debt, the repeal of the Law of Public Magisterial Career, the leveling of the teachers hired with the appointed ones and that 10% of the GDP was dedicated to the Education sector.
On 15 June 2017, the teacher strike in Cuzco broke out, encouraged by the Sute-R, that is, the regional section of the SUTEP. Education Minister Marilú Martens responded that what the teachers demanded was not feasible, if the budget was realistically considered. The dialogue tables between the technical team of the Ministry of Education and the representatives of the teachers' union, sponsored by the Regional Government, failed successively, accusing each other of intransigence.
The government attributed the strike to the political motivations of the unions, where there were infiltrations by extremist elements, including Movadef, the political facade of the Shining Path. The teachers' strike extended to 13 regions, five of which were radicalized: Puno, Madre de Dios, Moquegua, Apurímac, as well as Cusco, which was the nerve center. In response, the Minister notified the Comptroller's Office to take the necessary measures to safeguard the educational service, and demanded that the Regional Governments proceed to dismiss the teachers and hire others, if necessary.
In search of a solution to the strike that had been going on for more than a month and a half, Minister Martens, Prime Minister Zavala, the 25 regional governors and the Regional Office of Lima met. They reached an agreement that was announced on 3 August, which consisted in the increase of S/.2000 will be held from December 2017 and no longer from March 2018. With this, the matter was considered solved and it was announced that the classes would restart on 7 August.
However, the teachers indicated that they were not represented in the agreements with the government, so they continued with the strike. On 8 August, the government signed another agreement, this time with the group of regional secretaries of SUTEP (Sute-R), agreeing to lift the strike in Cuzco, Lambayeque, Pasco and Lima Provincias. But in several regions the measure of strength was maintained (18 in total), because the Bases of the teachers' union did not consider themselves duly represented by the National Executive Committee (CEN) of the SUTEP, nor by the Sute-R. It was these Bases, gathered in the National Committee of Struggle of the Bases of the SUTEP and under the leadership of Pedro Castillo Terrones, which in reality ended up managing the mobilizations of the teachers in all the regions. The same Kuczynski president offered himself as mediator, inviting the delegates of the teachers to meet him in the Palace to reach a solution, but the strike got even worse, with the arrival in the capital of the striking teachers of the regions, those who carried out marches in the city and concentrations in the Plaza San Martín.
On 16 August, Martens presented himself to the education commission of the Congress, where he promised to receive the representatives of the regional bases. They accepted the invitation. On the evening of the same day, President Kuczynski, in a television message to the Nation, exhorted the teachers to strike down and return to the schools. While, on 18 August, dialogue began between the specialists of the Ministry of Education and the leaders of the teachers, who were joined by five congressmen representing the various parties (except for the Popular Force), who were in the capacity of overseers, but ended up becoming intermediaries.
After four days of meetings, a preliminary agreement was foreseen in which it appeared that the increase of S / 2000 would begin in November 2017, that would be leveled to teachers hired with those named in both salaries and social benefits, would be scheduled the payment of the social debt, would allow the voluntary retirement of teachers from 55 years of age, among other benefits for the teaching sector. However, when the signing of the agreement was only expected, the teachers announced that they would not do so, questioning the fact that the minister had not received them personally and had used the congressmen as intermediaries. But according to the report of the congressmen, it was because the teachers insisted that the evaluation of the teachers be suspended indefinitely and that was the point at which the Ministry of Education did not want to give the arm to twist, considering that the meritocracy in the teaching career it was something non-negotiable. It was then clarified that the teachers do not really oppose the evaluations, but rather the procedure that they intend to apply, which they described as having a subjective character. Interior Minister Carlos Basombrío Iglesias was also pointed out as having been a disturbing element in the negotiations, for organizing the leader of the bases, Pedro Castillo, as close to the Movadef senderista, and for saying that the government would not negotiate with that class of elements. .
Although a large section of the faculty held the strike, on 24 August the government issued a supreme decree formalizing the benefits mentioned in the pre-agreement, and the teachers were warned that if they did not return to the classroom after 28 August, new teachers would be hired. In the following week, the teacher marches in the capital followed, which included violent confrontations with the police. Until 2 September, the leader Pedro Castillo announced the temporary suspension of the strike, according to an agreement reached at the Extraordinary National Congress of the regional SUTEs.
Strikes in the health sector.
On 4 July 2017, doctors from the Ministry of Health began an indefinite national strike to demand a series of improvements in their sector. The measure paralyzed care in various services, with the exception of the intensive care and emergency units. Among the claims of the Peruvian Medical Federation is the increase in the budget for the Health sector and for the Comprehensive Health Insurance (SIS). They also demanded the resignation of the Minister of Health Patricia Garcia Funegra, who is responsible for the very poor situation of the sector, for not having requested a larger budget for the year 2017, which has generated the shortage of medicines, reagents and equipment. On 9 August, after a meeting of the representatives of the FMP with Prime Minister Fernando Zavala and Minister Patricia García, the strike was lifted, after agreeing an increase in the budget for the health sector that implies salary increases and greater supply of medicines and implements in health centers, among other agreements.
Likewise, the Federation of Nurses of the Ministry of Health of Peru (Fedeminsap), which brings together nurses working in establishments belonging to the Ministry of Health network (MINSA), began on 8 August 2017 an indefinite strike in all the regions, in demand for an increase in the budget of the Health and SIS sector, the approval of a new salary scale, the implementation of nursing head positions, and the increase in the number of nurses hired. Finally, on 19 August, after several sessions of dialogue between the Ministry of Health and the Federation, an agreement was reached, and the strike was lifted at a national level.
A national obstetric strike was also unleashed, which lasted 13 days, from 3 to 16 August 2017.
Agricultural stop of 2018.
On 9 January 2018, an "agrarian strike" was initiated in large part of the Peruvian territory by medium and small independent farmers who demanded that the government declare the agricultural sector in a state of emergency, due to serious deficiencies in production and trade, especially in the potato sector, whose price had collapsed severely affecting producers. According to experts, this was due to the fact that, as a consequence of the El Niño phenomenon, the plantings and harvests of potatoes had coincided in the various regions, causing overproduction.
On 30 January 2018, the demonstrations turned violent and expanded to other departments, causing road blocks and serious material damage. Clashes took place between the national police of Peru and the demonstrators who left two people dead, one in Huancavelica and the other in Pasco. On 2 February, the government reached an agreement with the National Commission of Potato Producers, promising to buy the surplus of white potatoes. Although other leaderships in Huánuco, Ayacucho and Apurímac did not accept that agreement and the protests continued.
National Census of 2017.
On 22 October 2017 the XII Population Census, VII Housing and III Indigenous Communities began, which culminated on 5 November. The entity in charge of its realization was the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI). The census questionnaire had 47 questions regarding housing and basic services; to home; the migration of the home and the formation of families; on gender, disability and ethnicity. For the urban census the immobility of citizenship was declared on 22 October, but serious deficiencies occurred in its development, mainly due to the lack of training of census takers, mostly young volunteers. The cost of this census was calculated in S/170 million (US$52 million).
International relations.
APEC 2016.
From 19 to 20 November 2016, the capital of Peru hosted the 28th annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC), and the 24th of its leaders. For the second time, Lima assumed this responsibility, since it had already done so in 2008. It is a summit of the presidents and governors of the twenty-one member countries of the economic forum, including Barack Obama (United States), Vladimir Putin ( Russia) and Xi Jinping (China); and three presidents of Latin American countries: Michelle Bachelet (Chile), Enrique Peña Nieto (Mexico), as well as the president of the host country, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. As guests attended the president of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos; Mark Zuckerberg (founder of Facebook); and Christine Lagarde (managing director of the IMF); among others.
The agreements taken by the members of APEC, contained in the Declaration of Lima, revolved around 4 pillars: foreign trade; workers and small business; the connectivity; and climate change and food security. The most important initiatives were oriented to counteract the tendencies against foreign trade that emerged in some important countries, such as the case of the electoral threat of Donald Trump in the United States.
Official visits of Kuczynski abroad.
The first official visit of Kuczynski abroad went to China, in September 2016, where he met with President Xi Jinping, as well as with authorities of the political, business and commercial sector of that country. Kuczynski called this visit a success. Then he went to New York, where he participated in the 71 Period of Sessions of the General Assembly of the United Nations.
In November 2016 Kuczynski traveled to Chile, where he met with the president of that country, Michelle Bachelet. The bilateral agreements that were taken were the improvement of the infrastructure, the railroad from Tacna to Arica and the electrical interconnection for both cities. The start of the Binational Cabinets was also agreed.
On 24 February 2017, Kuczynski became the first Latin American president to visit United States President Donald Trump in the White House. The meeting lasted about 40 minutes. In a subsequent dialogue with journalists, Kuczynski said he had spoken about "issues of common interest, such as trade, migration, problems in Latin America and the possibility of a very good relationship with the United States." It also transpired that the situation in Venezuela was discussed.
From 6 to 14 June 2017, Kuczynski made an official visit to France and Spain, together with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Ricardo Luna; and of Economy and Finance, Alfredo Thorne. In France he held a meeting with President Emmanuel Macron, at the Elysee Palace, becoming the first Latin American president to be received by the French president, who had recently assumed office. In Spain he met with the head of the Government of that country, Mariano Rajoy.
On 15 September 2017, due to the ministerial cabinet crisis, Kuczynski suspended a scheduled trip to New York, where he was to attend the General Assembly of the United Nations. On 22 September, he traveled to Vatican City to meet with Pope Francisco and thank him for the official visit he would make to Peru in January 2018.
On 3 November 2017, Kuczynski made a trip to Argentina, to meet with President Mauricio Macri and sign several bilateral agreements. And on 9 November, he arrived in the city of Da Nang, in Vietnam, to attend the 25th Leaders Summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC). The trip included the signing of a free trade agreement between Peru and Australia.
On 10 March 2018, Kuczynski traveled to Chile to attend the inauguration of President Sebastián Piñera. He also met with presidents of other countries and the outgoing president of Chile, Michelle Bachelet.
Bi-national cabinets.
In October 2016, the X Peru-Ecuador Binational Cabinet was held in Macas, a meeting of the Ministers of States and the presidents of both nations, where important agreements were agreed.
In November 2016, the Second Binational Cabinet Peru-Bolivia was held in Sucre, where presidents Kuczynski and Evo Morales met to sign the Sucre Declaration, in which they highlighted the importance of ministerial cabinets to contribute to the strengthening and deepening the relations of both countries.
In July 2017 the First Binational Cabinet Peru-Chile was held in Lima, which has been considered a historic event, as it inaugurated a different stage in the bilateral relations of the two countries. Several agreements were signed between the ministries and institutions of the two nations, and as a culmination, Presidents Kuczynski and Michelle Bachelet signed the Declaration of Lima.
In September 2017, the III Peru-Bolivia Binational Cabinet was held in the city of Lima, culminating in the Declaration of Lima signed by the presidents Kuczynski and Evo Morales.
In October 2017, the XI Peru-Ecuador Binational Cabinet was held in the city of Trujillo, attended by Ecuadorian President Lenín Moreno, who signed the Declaration of Trujillo with Kuczynski.
At the end of February 2018, the IV Binational Cabinet Peru-Colombia was held in Cartagena de Indias, which was attended by President Kuczynski, who met with his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos.
Relations with Venezuela.
Peru was one of the countries with the most Venezuelan refugees. In the photo, a Peruvian citizen with a Venezuelan refugee who fled her country because of the current crisis.
The Peruvian government assumed a very active role with respect to the Venezuelan crisis. In March 2017 some diplomatic friction with Venezuela took place, as a result of some comments that Kuczynski made about the situation of that country, during his visit to the United States. Before the verbal attacks of the Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his chancellor Delcy Rodríguez against Kuczynski, the Peruvian government called in consultation with his ambassador in Caracas, Mario López Chávarry.
In the message to the Nation of 28 July 2017, Kuczynski mentioned the situation in Venezuela, referring to the "decomposition of democratic institutions" and the "humanitarian crisis" that the country is experiencing, to conclude by saying that its objective was "to contribute to strengthen democracy throughout the region".
On 30 July 2017, the Peruvian government announced that it would not recognize the results of the "illegitimate election of the National Constituent Assembly" in Venezuela, and then summoned a meeting of foreign ministers from Latin American countries to evaluate the situation in that country. It was held on 8 August 2017, at the Torre Tagle Palace in Lima, and counted with the participation of 17 countries. A 16-point manifesto was signed, called the Lima Declaration, which condemns the breakdown of the democratic order in Venezuela and ignores the National Constituent Assembly.
The Venezuelan government sent a protest note to Peru, but it was declared by the Foreign Ministry of Peru as not received, because it contained "unacceptable terms." Then, the Government of Peru decided to expel the ambassador of Venezuela, Diego Molero Bellavia. In response, the Venezuelan government ordered the expulsion of the Chargé d'Affaires of Peru (since Peru had already withdrawn its ambassador since March).
On 16 February 2018, the Peruvian Foreign Ministry informed that it was withdrawing the invitation to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to the VIII Summit of the Americas, scheduled to take place in Lima on 13 and 14 April. It was based on the provisions of the Declaration of Quebec of 2001, which literally says: "Any alteration or unconstitutional rupture of a democratic order in a State of the Hemisphere constitutes an insurmountable obstacle for the participation of the Government of that State in the Summit process. of the Americas."
Visit of Pope Francis.
Between 18 and 21 January 2018, Pope Francis made a pastoral visit to Peru, which included the cities of Lima, Puerto Maldonado and Trujillo. He (the Pope) chose Puerto Maldonado (Madre de Dios), in the Peruvian jungle, as the center of a region affected by deforestation and human trafficking; and Trujillo for being the city most affected by the onslaught of El Niño. In all those places he received the fervor and affection of the people.
In Puerto Maldonado he had a meeting with the representatives of the Amazonian peoples and in his speeches he addressed issues such as illegal mining, human trafficking and violence against women. In Trujillo he held a mass in the Huanchaco resort and toured the streets in the neighborhood of Buenos Aires affected by the El Niño. As a final act, the Pope offered a Mass at the Las Palmas Air Base (Lima), which according to the calculations of the Archdiocese of Lima brought together one and a half million people.
Post-presidency.
Transition to the Vizcarra Administration.
Vice President, former Minister of Transport, and then Ambassador to Canada Martin Vizcarra succeeded Kuczynski and assumed the presidency, marking the end of Kuczynski presidency. Then second-vice president and Prime Minister Mercedes Araoz assumed the role of first vice president, leaving the seat for second-vice president vacant. Shortly after on 2 April, Araoz resigned from the Prime Ministership, who believed that Vizcarra would completely replace Kuczynski's cabinet.
Vizcarra did in fact replace most of Kuczynski's cabinet, and the Vizcarra's new cabinet was inaugurated on 2 April 2018.
Investigations, Operation Car Wash, and Odebrecht.
After Kuczynski successfully resigned from the impending congressional impeachment vote, Kuczynski's passport was immediately confiscated and the former head of state was restricted from leaving Peru. His multiple bank accounts were also frozen and were under investigation.
The former president remained out of the public eye for nearly a year, with rare public appearances and no interviews until a year after his resignation, unlike most of his predecessors. He gave an interview to El Comercio on the first anniversary of his resignation in March 2019, where he claimed that the suspicious payments he made immediately following his resignation were in fact his tax payments in 2018.
Soon, on 10 April of that year, a judge ordered for Kuczynski's arrest and authorized a detail search of his several properties and was ordered preventative detention for 10 days. He was later convicted and sentenced to 36 months of preventative prison. He appealed for house arrest due to his minor health issues and was granted house arrest until further investigations conclude.
Relations with Vizcarra.
Kuczynski has mentioned that he has spoken multiple times with Vizcarra and has denied to comment whether he still believes that Vizcarra "betrayed" him.
During his hospitalization, Vizcarra has reportedly visited him once "as a friend" rather than a political move. Additionally, Vizcarra defended Kuczynski from being transferred from house arrest to prison.
Public persona.
Peruvians see Pedro Pablo Kuczynski joining the line of disgraced and corrupt presidents that Peru has had for the past decades. Kuczynski's accomplishments during his brief, less than two-year presidency are seen as minimal and mediocre, having failed to address pressing issues of economic slumps, natural disasters, corruption, and more. Additionally, many Peruvians do note Kuczynski's broken campaign promise to not pardon former president Alberto Fujimori.
Kuczynski's presidency is also marked as a time of economic stability and a cheerleader of Peru to the rest of the world.
Health issues.
Kuczynski claims to have heart issues.

National Union of Packing Case Makers (Wood and Tin), Box Makers, Sawyers and Mill Workers

The National Union of Packing Case Makers (Wood and Tin), Box Makers, Sawyers and Mill Workers was a trade union principally representing workers involved in making packaging in the United Kingdom.
The union was founded in 1872 as the London Wood and Tin Packing Case Makers' Society. It initially focused on providing benefits for members who were out of work, and attempting to negotiate minimum wage rates for the industry. Its membership remained small for many years, peaking at 521 in 1890, but dropping to only 192 in 1910. That decade, it broadened its remit, adopting its final name, and membership began increasing, reaching 5,038 in 1948.
By the 1960s, membership of the union was again falling, dropping to 3,408 in 1964. The following year, it decided to merge into the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers.

Iron Mountain Railway (California)

The Iron Mountain Railway was a narrow gauge common carrier railroad located northwest of Redding, California. Its line ran from Keswick, California on the Southern Pacific Railroad to Iron Mountain, California, at the base of Iron Mountain. 
Opening.
The company was incorporated July 17, 1895 and the line was completed February 1, 1896. The primary cargo was ore and ore concentrate from the Iron Mountain Mine, though it increasingly serviced other mines as well. The railroad was owned by Mountain Copper Company which also owned the Iron Mountain Mine and the Hornet Mine, the railroad's primary ore supplier later in its operation.
Closure.
The Iron Mountain mine shut down 1921 and an aerial tramway was built from the Hornet Mine directly to the Southern Pacific Railroad. With the closing of the last independent mine, common carrier status was abandoned on 5 February 1927 though limited service may have continued as late as 1929. The remaining line was salvaged by the early 1930s. Today much of the upper sections of the railroad bed is used by Iron Mountain Road.

Vector-H

Vector-H (Vector Heavy) was a planned two-stage or three-stage orbital expendable launch vehicle in development by the American aerospace company Vector Launch to cover the commercial small satellite launch segment (CubeSats). It was planned to be an expanded version of the Vector-R rocket, more than doubling the payload capacity. After Vector Launch ceased operations in December 2019, the future development of the rocket is unofficially canceled.
Design.
Vector-H would have used two stages, both 1.2 m in diameter, filled with Propylene/LOX propellant. The main body of the rocket was planned to be constructed using a lightweight carbon composite material.
The launch vehicle's first stage would have been powered by six LP-1 LOX/propylene engines, delivering 81,000 newtons of force. The second stage would have been powered by one LP-3 LOX/propylene engine, delivering 4,400 newtons of force. The engines used a 3D-printed engine injector, designed with help from NASA's Science, Technology and Mission Directorate (STMD) Flight Opportunities program. This allows the injector to be produced as a single piece of hardware, instead of as individual components. The vehicle was also planned to include an optional third stage powered by a solid rocket motor. This would have allowed the upper stage to boost micro satellites into a higher orbit.
Vector-HE1.
The Vector-HE1 planned variant was to have the same body as the standard Vector-H but include an electric powered third stage.
Intended usage.
Vector-H was designed to launch a payload to a Sun-synchronous orbit, suitable for CubeSats and other small payloads. The cost would have been less than , a price point that the company hoped will allow it to attract one hundred launches per year. Customers could have choose to encapsulate their spacecraft in payload fairings provided by the company, which could be easily attached to the rocket shortly before launch, in several different configurations, such as fitting CubeSats dispensers or multiple satellites in a single fairing.
Vector would have used on-site payload integration for the early launches. However it expected to be able to integrate payloads at their Arizona and California Payload Facilities and ship them to their launch sites.
Launch sites.
Vector Space planned to use the LC-46 launch site in Florida, Spaceport Camden, and Pacific Spaceport Complex. Additionally Vector Space investigated adding more minimal infrastructure launch pads either located on land in the US, or to launch the rocket from barges on the ocean.

Chery Tiggo 5x

The Chery Tiggo 5x is a subcompact crossover SUV produced by the Chinese manufacturer Chery under the Tiggo crossover product series. The model also spawned an electric variant called the Chery Tiggo e, and shared the platform with the later introduced Cowin Showjet in 2019.
Overview.
The Chery Tiggo 5x is the production version of the 2014 Chery Concept Beta concept car. 
The production Chery Tiggo 5x was launched on the Chinese car market in the second half of 2017, positioned between the subcompact Chery Tiggo 3x and the compact Chery Tiggo 3. Much like the marketing position of the Tiggo 3x, the Tiggo 5x is the sportier version of the Tiggo 5 despite being a completely different model. 
In China, the Tiggo 5x was sold with a lone engine option, a 1.5 liter inline-4 engine. An electric variant called the Tiggo e was also offered in China equipped with a 53.6 kWh battery and delivering a range of 401 km / 251 miles (NEDC), with the Tiggo e drivetrain producing 95 kW ( 127 hp ) of power, and 250 N.m / 184 lb.ft of torque.
The top speed of the 2019 Chery Tiggo e is 160 km/h / 100 mph, with 0 to 50km/h acceleration in 3.9 seconds.
Chinese version facelift.
A facelift was launched in 2019 featuring revised front and rear end designs with the front end sharing the same family front fascia with the Chery Tiggo 8. Another facelift was launched in 2020 featuring a further updated front fascia inline with the second generation Tiggo 7.
Markets.

Jean de Dammartin

Jean de Dammartin or Jehan de Dammartin sometimes spelled Dampmartin (14th-century in Jargeau (former province of the Orléanais – 1454 in Tours) was a 15th-century French architect.

Biography.
Jean de Dammartin was the architect of the transept of the Saint-Julien du Mans Cathedral, between 1420 and 1431.
Forced to leave Le Mans after the English took the city during the hundred years war, he succeeded Olivier Freredoux as architect of the cathédrale Saint-Gatien de Tours from 1431 and worked there until 1453 on the facade, when he was replaced by Jean Papin. He is referred to in the texts as "maistre and governor of the church of Tours".
Jean married Jeannette Moreau and had a son, Huguet de Dammartin, sculptor, who worked under his direction, as early as 1431, on the facade of the Tours Cathedral.
Jean de Dammartin died in Tours in 1454.

Ghachar Ghochar

Ghachar Ghochar is a 2015 psychological drama novella written by Kannada author Vivek Shanbhag and was translated into English by Srinath Perur. Set in Bangalore, the book is about an unnamed narrator who reminisces about his dysfunctional family's rags to riches story which results in troubling behavioural changes in each of them. The title is a made-up phrase, invented by the narrator's wife and her brother, which means "tangled up beyond repair".
"Ghachar Ghochar" was included by "The New York Times" in their listing of the best books of 2017 and it was a finalist for the "Los Angeles Times" Book Prize and the International Dublin Literary Award. 
Plot.
The novel is the first-person account of an unnamed, sensitive young man. He regularly visits an old-world coffee shop in Bangalore where he is drawn towards a laconic waiter named Vincent, who the man believes possess prophetic abilities. The man reminisces about his bond with a young feminist named Chitra, whom he unceremoniously cast aside, but his mind mostly wanders towards his dysfunctional family, consisting of his parents, uncle, and a divorced, elder sister. He recollects the rags to riches story of his family, and worries about the deteriorating relationship between him and his wife, Anita, who is troubled by his lack of motivation and apathy towards his family's misdeeds.
Reception.
Writing for "The New York Times", Parul Sehgal considered "Ghachar Ghochar" to be "a great Indian novel" and wrote, "Folded into the compressed, densely psychological portrait of [the narrator's] family is a whole universe: a parable of rising India, an indictment of domestic violence, a taxonomy of ants and a sly commentary on translation itself." Deborah Smith of "The Guardian" reviewed that the book was "both fascinatingly different from much Indian writing in English, and provides a masterclass in crafting, particularly on the power of leaving things unsaid."
Eileen Battersby of "The Irish Times" labelled "Ghachar Ghochar" as "one of the finest literary works you will ever encounter"; she drew comparisons to the works of R. K. Narayan, Anton Chekhov and Machado de Assis and found the unnamed narrator to be reminiscent of the protagonist in Ivan Goncharov’s Russian novel "Oblomov". Lucy Scholes of "The Independent" too took note of the comparisons to Chekhov and wrote that "brevity serves Shanbhag’s storytelling to great effect, not least because much of what makes the narrative so gripping lies in what he leaves unsaid." Reviewing the book for "The Globe and Mail", Jade Colbert found the unnamed narrator to be "a superfluous man of the type Chekhov might recognize" and commended Shanbhag for subtlety conveying the troubled "gender dynamic" in India.
Preti Taneja of the "New Statesman" took note of the book's feminist themes and wrote, "Perur’s translation captures the heartbreaking achievement of Shanbhag’s writing: to present, in a line or two, a body and mind coming of age in a society that casts violence as tenderness, ownership as love." Writing for "Hindustan Times", Prajwal Parajuly praised Shanbhag for finding emotional depth in his sparse prose.
"The New York Times" included "Ghachar Ghochar" in their literary critics' listing of the best books of 2017. The book was longlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award in 2017 and was a finalist for the "Los Angeles Times" Book Prize in 2018.

Eldon Insurance

Eldon Insurance Services Limited or simply Eldon Insurance is a British insurance broking and claims management company controlled by Arron Banks. It is based in Bristol but also has offices in Newcastle, Southampton, and South Africa. Founded in 2007 the company is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). It specialises in motor vehicle insurance and currently operates under the trade names GoSkippy, Footprint, "Plato Insurance Services", and "Vavista". Also previously "Solid Insurance" (2013), "Business Choice Direct" (2014–16) and others.
It is closely related to Gibraltar-based Southern Rock Insurance which is the main underwriter for Eldon and also controlled by Banks.
History.
The company was incorporated in August 2007 with John Gannon and Paul Chase-Gardener as founding directors. Michael Lee became a director shortly after and was the managing director in 2009, when said that the company had a staff of 160 and customer base of 250,000. Eldon's parent company was then the Gibraltar-based Southern Rock Holdings, which also owns Southern Rock Insurance. In 2010 the company website identified it as a Newcastle-based provider of motor claims management services on behalf of Southern Rock Insurance. Lee, who co-founded Southern Rock Holdings and had also served as managing director of Southern Rock Insurance, resigned his directorship in April 2011 to move to Hastings Direct.
At the time, the trio of Banks, Chase-Gardener and Gannon were also the three executive directors of Bristol-based Brightside Group and owned 72% of Southern Rock Insurance, growing the group out of Commercial Vehicle Direct which they co-founded in 2001. The launch of the "GoSkippy" brand six months after Banks' departure as chief executive at Brightside in 2012 preceded a bitter dispute including legal action between Brightside, Southern Rock and Eldon.
Gannon left at the end of August 2012, and by the end of the year the company began leasing office space on the Cribbs Causeway development in Bristol to house the "GoSkippy" operation and Banks subsequently hired a number of Brightside's staff. Banks became a director upon the departure of Gannon, and Chase-Gardener also departed in February 2013. As Banks and Gannon sold Brightside shares, Chase-Gardener swapped all his shares in Rock Holdings to increase his Brightside interest, also resigning from the group's other companies. On 26 February 2013 ownership of Eldon transferred to another group 70% owned by Banks, and received authorisation as a UK insurance broker at the start of April. According to Eldon's publicly-filed accounts, the transfer of ownership was achieved by first issuing almost £2.2m of new shares to the company's ultimate parent, Rock Holdings in a debt for equity deal in February. Those shares and the original 100 were then purchased by the newly-created, Isle of Man-based, ICS Risk Solutions in July for £7.5m. This did not affect control of Eldon as Arron Banks was then majority shareholder in both parent companies.
Banks was forced to resign from Eldon in September 2013 and Southern Rock Insurance the following year, as part of an agreement with Gibraltarian regulators also accepting a "period of ban or self-exclusion from other insurance directorships" after they found Southern Rock to be trading while technically insolvent. Banks was replaced as a director by his Hong Kong-based brother Johnathan. 
Just before Christmas 2013, the company's auditors, Baker Tilly LLP resigned, reporting that the relationship had broken-down because "by failing to supply accurate information, management is imposing a limitation of scope on our work." Banks has pointed to a conflict of interest. By early 2014 Eldon had launched the "Footprint" brand to sell van and motorbike policies and "Business Choice Direct" for commercial insurance. At the end of the year it began a partnership to sell insurance under the Debenhams brand.
Eldon's new holding company ICS Risk Solutions, in 2015 also paid Southern Rock Insurance (which continues to be the main underwriter for Eldon) approximately £77m for rights to some of its future income, enabling it meet its obligation under solvency regulations. Brightside and Southern Rock reached an undisclosed out of court settlement in May 2015 bringing to a close their disputes relating to intellectual property, breaches of trading agreements and breaches of terms of business agreements. The following month Eldon sent call centre workers home while it trailed moving their work to South Africa, stating that it was "entering into a period of consultation with up to 200 members of staff across the business". Subsequently, 174 employees were made redundant at the Newcastle and Bristol offices.
Eldon is also 50% owner of a joint venture called "Vavista", which began trading in 2015 and provides "health and wellbeing programmes" with its insurance policies. It also has a 49% shareholding in Legal Protection Group, launched in 2016, which sells legal protection insurance, legal services and emergency assistance products. In October 2016 another new company, Somerset Bridge was created to act as managing general agent in order to diversify the panel of insurers Eldon has access to. In November the "Business Choice Direct" brand was moved to a newly created subsidiary company of which Eldon owns 51%. According to the company website they also moved into new offices in Eastleigh.
During 2017 Eldon moved its offices in Newcastle into larger premises. Late in the year, it was reported that Banks intends to float the company on the public stock market in 2018. However the professor of finance at Manchester Business School called Banks' reported £250m valuation "highly ambitious".
Leave.EU.
Elizabeth (Liz) Bilney who became a director shortly before Paul Chase-Gardener resigned, was reported to be the CEO in 2017 and was also in charge at Leave.EU during the Brexit campaign. Andy Wigmore was also a director at the time (December 2015 until April 2018). The company's Bristol headquarters was also the HQ for Leave.EU. Brittany Kaiser, a former director of Cambridge Analytica has said that when she visited Leave.EU HQ in late 2015 she saw Eldon employees staffing a call centre for the campaign. Adding that she thought the staff, most who had never participated in politics before, were calling leads or current customers of Eldon.
In August 2016 the Leave.EU campaign announced a sponsorship deal with the "Goskippy" brand and offering a 10% discount on insurance. From June 2017 the "Goskippy" brand began appearing alongside that of Leave.EU on the campaign's Facebook and Twitter posts, including one featuring a photo of the burning Grenfell Tower stating "An amnesty for Grenfell illegal immigrants? Absolutely not! The law is the law."
"The Guardian" reported in April 2018 that the UK Information Commissioner's Office was investigating whether Eldon shared data with the Leave.EU campaign. Although Banks had previously admitted advertising insurance products to campaign supporters, he stated "Eldon has never given or used any data to Leave.EU. They are separate entities with strong data control rules. And vice versa."
In November 2018 the Information Commissioner took enforcement action against Eldon Insurance and Leave.EU for breaches of the Data Protection Act, fining them a total of £135,000.
Mark Boleat became Chairman of Eldon in June 2019.
Finances.
During 2013 Eldon sold 113,000 policies and recorded a £239,000 pre-tax profit on a revenue of £12.8m including income of £9m from services sold to Southern Rock Insurance, but paying £11.4m to Rock Services, another UK company that Banks holds a directorship with. By 2015 Eldon achieved a £284,000 profit on a revenue of £33.7m with income of £27.7m from Southern Rock and paying £27.5m to Rock Services. Rock Holdings Ltd, another holding company based on the Isle of Man, is the parent of both Rock Services and Southern Rock Holdings. Rock Services' main activity seems to be "recharge of goods and services" with Southern Rock Insurance. In 2016 operating profit was £253,000 but restructuring costs led to a loss of approximately £22,000 despite an increase in revenue to £47.3m from improved sales of 299,000 new policies and 90,000 renewals. That year saw a reduced income from Southern Rock of £22.1m but an increased £39.5m paid to Rock Services. The company's underlying profitability is difficult to assess because of a practice of recording administration expenses that closely track turnover. At the same time Southern Rock posted a loss of £32m in 2016, the fifth of seven years since 2010 it has made multimillion-pound losses on its core underwriting business and its solvency ratio dropped from 135% (2015) to 103% in 2016. According to Banks Eldons's profits leapt to £16.7m for the first half of 2017, saying that the company's business had been transformed by the same AI technology used in the Brexit campaign.

Friedberg–Friedrichsdorf railway

The Friedrichsdorf–Friedberg railway is a single-track, non-electrified branch line in the German state of Hesse. It is listed as timetable route 636 and integrated in the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund as line 16.
History.
The planning of a connection to Friedberg as a continuation of the Homburg Railway began as early as 1868. However, it was not clear whether the connection to the Main-Weser Railway or a line to the Taunus would be built first. It was decided to build the Usingen Railway ("Usinger Bahn"), now called the "Taunusbahn" (Taunus Railway). Construction of the Friedrichsdorf–Friedberg link began in 1898 and the line was put into operation on 15 July 1901. The trains started at the terminus of "Homburg vor der Höhe" (also called "Homburg Neu" (new) station) on the lower Louisenstraße, which had been the starting point of the Usingen Railway since 1895. At the request of the emperor, Wilhelm II and to increase the capacity of the line from Frankfurt to Bad Homburg and from Friedrichsdorf to Friedberg, the line was upgraded to two tracks between 1907 and 1912 and a through station was built in Bad Homburg.
After the upgrade of the line, it was used by the trains of the Bad Nauheim–Wiesbaden railway ("Bäderbahn"), consisting of "Eilzüge" (fast-stopping trains) from Wiesbaden via Höchst and Bad Homburg to Bad Nauheim and a daily pair of "Durchgangszüge" (through trains) on the Berlin–Wiesbaden route.
Due to decreasing profitability, the second track was dismantled after the end of the First World War. With the takeover by the Nazis, it was restored for the planned Friedberg–Hungen–Alsfeld–Hersfeld line. During the Second World War, a bridge at the entrance to Friedberg station that carried the second track to the Main-Weser Railway was destroyed. Subsequently, the second track was dismantled, starting with the Friedberg–Rosbach section, which was completed by 1950, and later with the Rosbach–Friedrichsdorf section, which was completed by 1968. This also made the block post at Straßheim at the original ladder junction at the entrance to the station superfluous. Based on the width of the embankment and the bridges, the location of the former second track is still largely recognisable and a piece of it was maintained as a catch point at the junction to the industrial siding in Rosbach. The bridge over the line to Hanau still exists and it now carries a freight connection from the Main-Weser Railway to the goods yard above the station.
While the Frankfurt–Friedrichsdorf section was electrified and signalling control was transferred to the new centralised relay interlocking in Bad Homburg, the mechanical interlocking on this line was initially preserved and Rosbach was rebuilt in 1985 as a halt ("Haltepunkt", that is without points). Also the sections of track became more operationally distinct at the end of the 20th century: the tight timing and the introduction of S-Bahn electric multiple units to Friedrichsdorf contrasted with the operations over the Friedrichsdorf–Friedberg line, which were mainly consisted of push-pull trains composed of Silberling (n-coaches) hauled by V 100 locomotives and Uerdingen railbuses; these were replaced by class 628 diesel multiple units, but services ran ever less frequently. The class 628 sets when not operating were usually stored outside Friedrichsdorf station towards Seulberg on a track to a no longer connected marshalling yard hump. With the commencement of S-Bahn operations to Friedrichsdorf and also to Friedberg, the normal Friedberg–Bad Homburg–Frankfurt through services were finally discontinued, although some long-distance trains still used the line. A 30 or 60-minute interval service was only re-introduced with the establishment of the "Rhine-Main-Verkehrsverbund".
After previous considerations of closing the line, the Butzbach-Licher Eisenbahn (BLE), a subsidiary of the Hessische Landesbahn, took over operations on 24 May 1998. New Stadler GTW railcars were procured for this operation.
Due to its success and rising passenger numbers, there were also plans to restore the second track or even to electrify it. Only a few bridges would have had to be widened. A footbridge in Friedrichsdorf parallel to Färberstraße was increased in the meantime as part of its renewal to allow for a possible overhead line. However, more economical modernisation of the line was chosen. At the beginning of 2002, the tracks were completely renewed with Y-shaped sleepers. The stations were also renovated and a new station, Friedberg Süd, was added. The Rosbach vor der Höhe station, which is about halfway along it, was upgraded to become the crossing station, where trains could pass. The crossing in Rodheim was abandoned and the station was rebuilt as a halt with a single track. Finally, the signalling technology was modernised. Thus, the railway was downgraded from a main line to a branch line. For part of the construction work, traffic had to be blockaded for several weeks. On 21 April 2002, the re-commissioning was celebrated with two commuter trains shuttling over the line (a steam train and a GTW set). Next day, regular services commenced under a new timetable. This included not only an extended period when half-hourly services ran on weekdays but also a full service on the weekend. In addition, some connection times at the end stations were changed.
The replacement of the bridge over the former Federal Highway 3 at the halt of Friedberg Süd was carried out in July 2017 during a three-week full closure of the line.
Route.
The line now begins in the Friedrichsdorf station, where the Taunus Railway branches off. The railway runs on a wide turn to the right to the east. After crossing autobahn 5 the line reaches the halt of Friedrichsdorf-Burgholzhausen. The halt and former train station of Rosbach-Rodheim is located in the Wetterau after a level crossing; until 1992 it was often used for the loading of sugar beet as is typical in the Wetterau. This is followed by Rosbach vor der Höhe, now classified as a full station. Since 1987, there has been an industrial siding to the REWE Group warehouse, which has not been operated since 2000 and is now overgrown. The connecting points were upgraded in 2015. The is a second level crossing within the station area. Located on the edge of Friedberg is the newest halt on the line, "Friedberg Süd". Here, until 2010, there was an industrial siding with an alternative access point on the right (to the south), which was still connected, but was no longer used. Since the embankment is relatively high, the actual track was reached by a zig zag. Like the REWE warehouse, the siding was integrated into the new interlocking technology by axle counter. After the former US barracks (Ray Barracks) the railway reaches Friedberg station, where it connects with the Main-Weser Railway. Before that, until the station was resignalled with an electronic interlocking, an industrial siding ran to the left (the town side/west) to Raiffeisen and the Ray Barracks.
The trains from Friedrichsdorf stop in Friedberg mostly at the bay platform 1a, rarely at the adjacent through platform 1. In Friedrichsdorf, trains mainly stop at track 4, rarely at the neighbouring track 5. Apart from the terminal stations, all platforms have a height of 55 centimetres and are barrier-free. Upgrading of Friedrichsdorf is being considered, but this is difficult because of the S-Bahn services that stop there.
The signals at Rosbach station and two level crossings in Rosbach and Rodheim are controlled via an electronic interlocking of the Sig L 90 class from a workstation at the signal box in Bad Homburg (on the Homburg Railway) and more precisely under direct traffic control mode with train control messages transmitted over analogue train radio. The entrance signal for Friedrichsdorf, like the whole station, is controlled by a relay interlocking directed from the Bad Homburg signal box. On the approach to Friedberg, a semaphore signal was formerly controlled by the local electro-mechanical signal box; on 25 October 2015, it was replaced by "Ks" signals (the most modern German standard for colour light signals) as part of its integration into the Friedberg electronic interlocking.
Operations.
The line is maintained by DB Netze and operated by HLB Hessenbahn GmbH until 2019. GTW 2/6 sets are used as rolling stock. The vehicles have an entry height of 55 centimetres, which is appropriate for the platforms at the various stations between the termini and are partially equipped with toilets. The densest service frequency is in the peak hour with a 30-minute interval with crossings in Rosbach.
Prospects.
As part of the possible electrification of the Taunus Railway, the RB 16 service is to be extended to provide capacity at Bad Homburg. This would require Rodheim station to be restored as a crossing point to optimise connections.

Petrolex Oil &amp; Gas Limited is a Nigerian company and part of Petrolex Group, an African integrated energy conglomerate. The company was founded in February 2007 by Segun Adebutu, a Nigerian entrepreneur. It provides services to the oil and gas industry. It is mainly involved in the refining, storage, distribution and retail of petroleum products in Nigeria and Africa. In December 2017, the firm started the construction of a 3.6 billion dollar capacity refinery and Sub-Saharan Africa’s largest tank farm as part of its Mega Oil City project in Ogun State, Nigeria. 
Background.
Petrolex CEO, Adebutu started an oil and fuel trading business around 2005 but showed interest in “mid-stream infrastructure” for $330 million. Adebutu's experience in different sectors led to the founding of Petrolex Oil &amp; Gas Ltd.
In December 2017, Petrolex announced its plan to build a $3.6 billion refinery plant with an output capacity of 250,000 barrels a day. The company is currently working on the “front-end engineering design” and will complete construction in 2021. This initiative is part of a larger Government program to end petroleum products imports in two years.
The firm has reportedly invested over $330 million in the Ibefun tank farm with a 600,000 million litres monthly capacity. The farm was commissioned by the Vice President of Nigeria Yemi Osinbajo, as part of phase one of a 10-year expansion program. At the time, the firm claimed that the development will ease road traffic in the region.
Petrolex Mega Oil City project.
Petrolex provides services in refining, storage, distribution and retailing of petroleum products. The company launched the planning, design and development of the Petrolex Mega Oil City in Ibefun, Ogun State in 2012. The complex spreads over 101 square kilometres, about 10 percent the size of Lagos State. It houses a residential estate for staff, an army barracks, 30 loading gantries for product disbursement, and a 4,000 truck capacity trailer park with accommodation for drivers. The goal is to create the largest petrochemical industrial estate in Sub-Saharan Africa. Upon completion, this estate will include a large capacity refinery, a tank farm, a liquefied petroleum gas processing plant, a lubricant facility and raw material industries (ex. fertiliser plants). The company has also negotiated the addition of 12,000 acres to expand the Oil City.
Operations overview.
Downstream operations.
Petrolex downstream operations include the processing of petroleum products, the supply and distribution of gas oil, kerosene; and the retail marketing of specific oil products. Petrolex has built a storage-tank farm and other “mid-stream infrastructure” for $330 million. The company is connecting its infrastructure to the Nigeria System 2B pipeline at Mosimi to support supply and distribution of petroleum products around the country. This infrastructure includes a procurement of barges, tug boats and a daughter vessel.

Museum of the Scottish Shale Oil Industry

The Museum of the Scottish Shale Oil Industry was created in 1990, to preserve the history of the shale industry in West Lothian and beyond. It is sited on a former mill at Millfield, near Livingston, Scotland. It is attached to the Almond Valley Heritage Centre, a large farm and play area. 
Buildings.
The Museum is housed in the reception area of Almond Valley Heritage Centre.
Collections.
The Museum has three primary collections. The Scottish Shale Oil Collection dates from the opening of the museum in 1990 and includes a vast array of objects, photographs and maps related to the shale industry. The Reference Collection sits in tandem with the Museum Collection, but includes mainly copied photographs and documents that have unknown provenance. The British Petroleum Archive was presented to the Museum in 2013 by the University of Warwick in an effort to make it publicly accessible. It is primarily made up of documents and a number of photographs relating mainly to the six shale oil companies which were still in existence in the 1910s, and the company that took them over. The Museum is currently undertaking a mass digitisation project with the aim being to have 95% of the collection available to view online. Much of this work is undertaken by volunteers.
Exhibitions.
The Museum has in place a permanent exhibition detailing the industrial history of the shale industry, and the social history surrounding it. There is also a temporary exhibition that stays in place for several months at a time. In the past this has focused on subjects such as Quoiting, the Burngrange Disaster and Pit Ponies. The current (April 2018) temporary exhibition was put together by museum volunteers, and highlights objects from the collection that have some meaning to them.
Recognition.
The Museum Collection is a Nationally Significant Collection. 
The Museum is Accredited.

March for Our Lives Portland

March for Our Lives Portland (officially March for Our Lives Portland, OR) was a protest held in Portland, Oregon, as part of March for Our Lives, a series of rallies and marches in Washington, D.C., and more than 800 cities across the world on March 24, 2018. Students organized the event, which included a march from the North Park Blocks to Pioneer Courthouse Square where a rally featured speakers, a performance by rock band Portugal. The Man, and a surprise appearance by rapper Black Thought of hip-hop band The Roots. The protest was the city's largest since the January 2017 Women's March on Portland; the Portland Police Bureau estimated a crowd size of 12,000.
Background.
March for Our Lives was a student-led demonstration in support of a tightening of U.S. gun control laws on March 24, 2018, in Washington, D.C., with more than 800 sibling events throughout the United States and around the world. Student organizers from Never Again MSD planned the march in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which many media outlets described as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation.
Protesters urged the introduction of universal background checks on gun sales, the raising of the federal minimum age for gun ownership and possession to 21, the closure of the gun show loophole, the restoration of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, and a ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines in the U.S. Turnout across the country was estimated at between 1.2 to 2 million people, making it one of the largest protests in American history.
Local organizers and planning.
Local student organizers included: Eliana Andrews; Alyssa Diaz; Zoe Dumm; Alexandria Goddard; Finn Jacobson; Calum Nguyen; Sophie Rupp; Ryan Tran; Kien Truong; Tyler White; and Ellie Younger.
According to the Portland Police Bureau, organizers obtained proper permits for the demonstration. The rally was scheduled to start at 10am and end by 2pm. The Portland-based rock band Portugal. The Man contacted organizers and offered to help, and practiced with a local choir prior to the concert. On the event's Facebook page in the lead-up to the event, around 9,000 people indicated plans to attend, and approximately 20,000 people had expressed interest in participating.
The Portland Bureau of Transportation planned to close all lanes of West Burnside Street from Broadway to 9th Avenue, as well as Southwest Broadway from Burnside to Yamhill Street, from approximately 10:30am to noon. The agency and event organizers also encouraged attendees and other downtown visitors to use public transit and to expect delays in the vicinity of the march route. The MAX Light Rail stations Pioneer Square South and Pioneer Square North were temporarily closed, and several bus lines had detours for a few hours. Online taxi firm Lyft offered march participants free rides in Portland and 49 other U.S. cities.
The route of the march was decided upon by event organizers and police, and plans to have safety monitors present were made.
Demonstration.
Participants gathered at the North Park Blocks and marched to Pioneer Courthouse Square via Burnside and Broadway. The rally began on time; protestors started marching at 10:30am. The march route was less than long and lasted approximately 90 minutes.
At Pioneer Courthouse Square, organizers held a moment of silence and rang a bell 17 times to commemorate victims of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Starting around 11:30am, eight local students ranging in age from grades 8 to 12 delivered speeches and performed songs and poems advocating gun control and school safety. They encouraged attendees to vote, remain politically active, and hold their politicians accountable. KOIN described the students' speeches as "articulate, informed, engaging and captivating".
Portugal. The Man performed "So American", "Feel It Still", and Oasis "Don't Look Back in Anger", and gave a "rousing" performance of Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are a-Changin'" with a choir of students from Vernon Elementary School. Lead singer and guitarist John Gourley said March for Our Lives' mission is nonpartisan. Rapper Black Thought of The Roots made an onstage surprise appearance with the band.
The protest was Portland's largest since the Women's March on Portland in January 2017, with more than 10,000 participants. The Portland Police Bureau's Traffic Division estimated 12,000 people attended. Event organizers said there were between 20,000 and 25,000 demonstrators. "The Oregonian" reported a crowd estimate of 12,000, and noted the presence of all age groups. "Willamette Week" said "tens of thousands" of people were in attendance and described the crowd as "massive and diverse", consisting of "families, teachers, grandparents and groups of students of all ages".
Counter-protestors, including members of Patriot Prayer, were present but the event was peaceful. Suzanne Bonamici and Earl Blumenauer, U.S. representatives for Oregon's 1st and 3rd congressional districts, respectively, participated in the march.

Johann Heinrich Graf

Johann Heinrich Graf (16 August 1852 – 17 June 1918) was a Swiss mathematician who was rector of the University of Bern and promoter of the Swiss National Library.
Life and work.
Graf, son of a policeman, studied at Polytechnicum of Zurich where he graduated in science in 1874. Once graduated, he became a secondary school teacher in Bern, while He did the doctorate studies supervised by Ludwig Schläfli. He received his doctorate in 1877 and the following year he was named assistant professor at the Berne University in which he remained until his death. In 1892, when Schläfli retired, he held his chair.
Aside from his research and teaching duties at the university, Graf exercised numerous administrative responsibilities: he was dean and rector of the university, he was councilor of the city of Bern, he was editor of the magazine of the society of natural sciences ("Naturforschende Gesellschaft"), secretary of the Central Commission of National Geography and, from 1895 to 1918, he chaired the Swiss Library Commission, a post from which he promoted the creation of the National Library of Switzerland ("Schweizerische Landesbibliothek").
Graf's mathematical work focuses on the Bessel functions, a topic about he published a book with Salomon Eduard Gubler, published in two volumes appeared in 1898 and 1900. He also wrote other works about geometry or geodesy.

Multi-homogeneous Bézout theorem

In algebra and algebraic geometry, the multi-homogeneous Bézout theorem is a generalization to multi-homogeneous polynomials of Bézout's theorem, which counts the number of isolated common zeros of a set of homogeneous polynomials. This generalization is due to Igor Shafarevich.
Motivation.
Given a polynomial equation or a system of polynomial equations it is often useful to compute or to bound the number of solutions without computing explicitly the solutions.
In the case of a single equation, this problem is solved by the fundamental theorem of algebra, which asserts that the number of complex solutions is bounded by the degree of the polynomial, with equality, if the solutions are counted with their multiplicities.
In the case of a system of polynomial equations in unknowns, the problem is solved by Bézout's theorem, which asserts that, if the number of complex solutions is finite, their number is bounded by the product of the degrees of the solutions. Moreover, if the number of solutions at infinity is also finite, then the product of the degrees equals the number of solutions counted with multiplicities and including the solutions at infinity.
However, it is rather common that the number of solutions at infinity is infinite. In this case, the product of the degrees of the polynomials may be much larger than the number of roots, and better bounds are useful. 
Multi-homogeneous Bézout theorem provides such a better root when the unknowns may be split into several subsets such that the degree of each polynomial in each subset is lower than the total degree of the polynomial. For example, let formula_1 be polynomials of degree two which are of degree one in indeterminate formula_2 and also of degree one in formula_3 (that is the polynomials are "bilinear". In this case, Bézout's theorem bounds the number of solutions by 
while the multi-homogeneous Bézout theorem gives the bound (using Stirling's approximation)
Statement.
A multi-homogeneous polynomial is a polynomial that is homogeneous with respect to several sets of variables. 
More precisely, consider positive integers formula_6, and, for , the formula_7 indeterminates formula_8 A polynomial in all these indeterminates is multi-homogeneous of multi-degree formula_9 if it is homogeneous of degree formula_10 in formula_11
A multi-projective variety is a projective subvariety of the product of projective spaces
where formula_13 denote the projective space of dimension . A multi-projective variety may be defined as the set of the common nontrivial zeros of an ideal of multi-homogeneous polynomials, where "nontrivial" means that formula_14 are not simultaneously 0, for each .
Bézout's theorem asserts that homogeneous polynomials of degree formula_15 in indeterminates define either an algebraic set of positive dimension, or a zero-dimensional algebraic set consisting of formula_16 points counted with their multiplicities.
For stating the generalization of Bézout's theorem, it is convenient to introduce new indeterminates formula_17 and to represent the multi-degree formula_18 by the linear form formula_19 In the following, "multi-degree" will refer to this linear form rather than to the sequence of degrees.
Setting formula_20 the multi-homogeneous Bézout theorem is the following.
"With above notation," "multi-homogeneous polynomials of multi-degrees" formula_21 "define either a multi-projective algebraic set of positive dimension, or a zero-dimensional algebraic set consisting of" "points, counted with multiplicities, where" "is the coefficient of" 
"in the product of linear forms"
Non-homogeneous case.
The multi-homogeneous Bézout bound on the number of solutions may be used for non-homogeneous systems of equations, when the polynomials may be (multi)-homogenized without increasing the total degree. However, in this case, the bound may be not sharp, if there are solutions "at infinity".
Without insight on the problem that is studied, it may be difficult to group the variables for a "good" multi-homogenization. Fortunately, there are many problems where such a grouping results directly from the problem that is modeled. For example, in mechanics, equations are generally homogeneous or almost homogeneous in the lengths and in the masses.

Pontiac Commercial Historic District

The Pontiac Commercial Historic District is a primarily commercial historic district located roughly along East Huron and South Saginaw Streets, within loop of Wide Track Drive, in Pontiac, Michigan. The core of the district, within the block bounded by Saginaw, Lawrence, Pike, and Wayne Streets, was originally listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. A boundary increase creating the present boundaries was listed in 1989. The district includes the Eagle Theater and the Grinnell Brothers Music House, also listed on the National Register.
History.
Pontiac was founded in 1818-19 by a group of investors. In 1819, Oakland County was established, with a county seat at Pontiac. By 1820, Pontiac had a dam, a sawmill, a flour mill, and a blacksmith shop. A courthouse was constructed in 1824, and by 1830 the city of Pontiac was clearly the center of commerce for the county. In 1840, the business district was completely leveled by fire. Buildings were rebuilt in the district, including a series of buildings in the heart of the district, facing North Saginaw between West Pike and West Lawrence Streets, which are still extant.
The industrial growth of the city only really began in 1886 when a carriage factory was established by local businessman Charles V. Taylor. By 1900, three quarters of the male workers in the city were employed in the carriage and buggy trade. By 1907 these factories were being converted to serves the automobile industry, and in 1909 General Motors absorbed many of the independent manufacturers, leading to an explosive growth in population. This growth led to a rebuilding of the central business district in the first three decades of the twentieth century, and much of the district contains buildings constructed during this time.
Description.
The Pontiac Commercial Historic District contains parts of sixteen blocks in downtown Pontiac including the single block within the original 1984 district. This block contains sixteen buildings, of which fourteen contribute to the historic nature of the district. The remainder of the district contains an additional 84 buildings, of which 53 contribute to the historic nature of the district.
Original 1984 district.
The original portion of the district designated in 1984 is located within a single block bounded by Saginaw, Lawrence, Pike, and Wayne Streets. The buildings are all commercial brick structures of two or three stories in height, fronting on the sidewalk. The eastern half of the block, fronting on Saginaw, was completely rebuilt some time after time 1840 fire and prior to 1865. Nearly all of these buildings, the oldest in the district, remain, running from 1 to 21 North Saginaw and interrupted only by a single non-contributing structure at 17 N. Saginaw. Many of the buildings were remodeled in the 1910s and 1920s, resulting in a breadth of architectural styles represented in the facades. Other buildings on the block, fronting on Lawrence and Pike, were originally constructed in the 1910s and 1920s.
Boundary increase.
The buildings in the 1989 boundary increase were primarily constructed during Pontiac's boom years of 1900-1930, although the district does include some structures from the late 19th century. The buildings span a series of architectural styles, from a Second Empire and Late Victorian brick commercial buildings from the 19th century to Neo-Classical Revival, Renaissance Revival, Adamesque, Romanesque, Gothic Revival, and Art Deco buildings from the 20th. Significant structures in the district include:

<doc id="56956144" url="?curid=56956144" title="Pago Pago Lounge">
Pago Pago Lounge

Pago Pago Lounge was a mid-twentieth century Tiki Bar named for and inspired by the capital city of Pago Pago on South Pacific Ocean island of American Samoa. Opened in 1947, it was the first Tiki themed restaurant and bar in Tucson, Arizona located in the Miracle Mile Historic District.
History.
In 1947 the architectural firm of Blanton and Cole were commissioned to design the exotic Pago-Pago Restaurant and Cocktail Lounge, a nightclub at 2201 N. Oracle Road (along the Miracle Mile Strip) for business partners Bob McAffee and Homer Moore. The project included design consultation from restaurant designers Clif and Lou Sawyer (who was involved in numerous other tiki themes bars including Link Paola's Outrigger in Honolulu, Trade Winds in Wagon Wheel Junction - Oxnard, California, Moongate in Los Angeles, the South Seas in Anchorage Alaska, and the Bikini in Phoenix, and The Lanai in San Mateo, California) and was built by general contractor F.B. Pacheco.
The Pago Pago was a one-story boxy, rectangular building that featured an entrance porch designed to evoke a Polynesian palapa. The circular entrance walls were adorned with faux Polynesian deco murals. Signs made of large individual letters outlined in neon spelled out “Pago Pago”; on both the east and north walls. The lounge featured a long, curving bar with a painted night sky and irregularly arranged booths. The building was a featured location in the 1956 MGM movie "A Kiss Before Dying."
The restaurant tagline was "It's Topical! It's Tropical, It's the Pago Pago.""
In the late 20th century the building was heavily modified but the original palm trees and building form survived. The building awaits restoration.
Pago Pago cocktail.
It is unknown if the Pago Pago created a drink named after itself when it first opened. One recipe from circa 1963 for the Lounge's eponymous tiki drink calls for:
1 dash Angostura bitters
Blended without ice, poured into pilsner glass filled with crushed ice.
Other themed cocktails.
In addition to the Pago Pago cocktail, the lounge developed a series of exotic tiki drinks which included:

Punta Sardegna Lighthouse

Punta Sardegna Lighthouse () is an active lighthouse located on the northern end of the granite promontory of Punta Sardegna, in front of the Maddalena archipelago, in the municipality of Palau on the Strait of Bonifacio.
History.
The lighthouse was built in 1913 and consists of a granite quadrangular tower, high, with balcony and lantern atop a 2-storey keeper's house. The building and the tower are painted white, the lantern dome in grey metallic. The lighthouse was electrified in 1935 and automated in 1975 when the last keeper left; in the years 1946 and 1947 the work was carried out by a woman, Genoveffa Balzano. 
For twenty years the lighthouse remained in complete abandonment until 1995, when the structure was given, by the Marina Militare in free perpetual concession, to the Universities of Trieste and Cagliari as seat of the Coastal and Marine Geomorphology Group (OCEANS).
In 1998 an agreement was signed between the two Universities and the City of Palau and extended in 2008 to the Province of Olbia-Tempio. Renovation work was carried out by the municipality and the centre, which can accommodate up to 16 researchers, was opened on June 3, 2005.
Description.
The light is positioned at above sea level and emits one white flash in a 5 seconds period visible up to a distance of . The light is completely automated, powered by a solar unit and managed by the Marina Militare with the identification code number 1030 E.F.; the building is managed by the Coastal and Marine Geomorphology Group.

Trivières

Trivières () is a village of Wallonia and a district of the municipality of La Louvière, located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium. 
It is located between Mons and Charleroi, about south of Brussels. It was a fully fledged municipality before the fusion of the Belgian municipalities. It is in size.
Etymology.
The origin of the name Trivières probably derives from the Latin word trivium, meaning three paths. Three roads intersect at the centre of Trivières, one leading east to , one north to Strépy, and one southwest to Estinnes. Three rivers, the Haine, the Princess of Rieu, and the Estinnes, also cross the village. Another, probably legendary, suggested origin of the name is that it derives from the Belgic tribe Treveri, said to have been massacred in the area by the Roman legions of Tiberius and Nero Claudius Drusus.
History.
Trivières dates to at least the Roman era, and has a rich archaeological history. Excavations have uncovered an artificial harbour that was dug out by the Romans to facilitate the trade of lime, as well as a lime kiln. The village is also the site of the most important known Merovingian necropolis in Belgium, dating from 480 to 610 AD. A hectare in size, the cemetery contains 385 graves split between two sections, one reserved for women and one reserved for men. The former section has yielded skeletons buried with gold jewelry. The latter, containing larger tombs than those for the women, has been found to contain axes, fibulae, arrows, and spears. A Frankish iron helmet was also found there, similar in design to the Anglo-Saxon Shorwell helmet found on the Isle of Wight in England. The helmet is particularly rare in that it is made of iron, rather than bronze.
From 1400 to 1754 the main seigneury of Trivières was held by several prominent families, including some who traced their descent to the kings of Ireland. In the 18th century the ground began to be exploited for coal; the village also contained several breweries and a small construction store.
Today, Trivières is in size, and is part of the municipality of La Louvière. Trivières was itself a municipality until the fusion of the Belgian municipalities. Before it was restructured in the 1970s, it had a population of 3,635 people. Afterwards, in 1996, it had a population of 3,704 people.
In the centre of the town is the church of Saint Martin. It replaced a 12th century church demolished around 1870 to 1875.

Led by second-year head coach Brad Underwood, the Illini played their home games at State Farm Center in Champaign, Illinois as members of the Big Ten Conference. The Illini finished the season 12–21, 7–13 in Big Ten play, to finish in a three-way tie for 10th place. Due to tie-breaking rules, they received the No. 11 seed in the Big Ten Tournament where they defeated Northwestern in the first round before losing to Iowa in the second round.
Previous season.
The Illini finished the 2017–18 season 14–18, 4–14 in Big Ten play to finish in a three-way tie for 11th place. As the No. 13 seed in the Big Ten Tournament, they lost in the first round to Iowa.
Offseason.
Player departures.
On March 5, 2018 Mark Smith announced his decision to transfer to a new school, indicating he did not fit into Illinois' system moving forward. On March 15, Leron Black announced his decision to forgoing final year of eligibility to declare for the NBA draft after already graduating with his bachelor's degree. He intended to sign with an agent, ending his collegiate career. On March 26, Te'Jon Lucas and Michael Finke both announced they would transfer to other programs. Lucas announced he would transfer to Milwaukee to complete his two years of remaining eligibility after sitting out for a season. Finke announced he will transfer to Grand Canyon and have one year of immediate eligibility as a graduate transfer. In late April, Matic Vessel left the program and returned to his home country of Slovenia to explore his options to continue basketball. On June 7, 2018 Greg Eboigbodin announced his intent to transfer out of Illinois, which left Illinois with four returning scholarship players from the prior season. Eboigbodin announced on July 30, 2018 that he would transfer to Northeastern University. 
2018 recruiting class.
In October 2017, five-star point guard Ayo Dosunmu verbally committed to Illinois over Wake Forest at the flagship Jordan Brand Store on State Street in the Chicago Loop. Dosunmu signed his National Letter of Intent in November 2017 to attend Illinois. In March 2018, Dosunmu was named one of 26 high school seniors who will participate in the Jordan Brand Classic on April 8, 2018, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Dosunmu is the third Illini to be selected to play in the Jordan Classic, joining Dee Brown who played for the Red team in 2002 and Jalen Coleman-Lands who played in 2015. Dosunmu was also selected to play in the second annual Iverson Roundball Classic All-American Game that will take place in April 2018 at Souderton Area High School outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Schedule and results.
The season will mark the first time in Big Ten history that the teams will play a 20-game conference schedule, setting a precedent for all Division I basketball. The new schedule will also include a regional component to increase the frequency of gamesamong teams in similar areas. Over the course of a six-year cycle (12 playing opportunities), in-state rivals will play each other 12 times, regional opponents will play 10 times, and all other teams will play nine times. Three in-state series that will be guaranteed home-and-homes: Illinois and Northwestern, Indiana and Purdue, and Michigan and Michigan State will always play twice.

Both the P20 and P20 Pro feature 1080p, 18.7:9 aspect ratio "FullView" displays with a "notch" tab at the top-centre, with the P20 having a 5.8-inch LCD panel and the P20 Pro a 6.1-inch AMOLED panel. Both models include a Kirin 970 system-on-chip and 128 GB of non-expandable internal storage, with 4 GB of RAM for the base model and 6 for the Pro. The models feature 3320 and 4000 mAh batteries respectively; the P20 line does not support wireless charging. Both models have a USB-C port and do not include a headphone jack.
Both models feature rear-facing Leica cameras. The P20 features a 12-megapixel colour sensor, while the P20 Pro features two cameras—a 40-megapixel wide-angle IMX600 sensor, and an 8-megapixel sensor with 3x optical zoom. By default, output from "quad pixels" on the P20 Pro's 40-megapixel sensor is pixel binned into 10-megapixel photos ("Light Fusion", similar to Nokia PureView's "pixel oversampling"), which is used to improve image quality and the brightness of low-light images, or for intentional monochrome photography. The camera configurations of both models additionally feature a 20-megapixel monochrome sensor, whose output can be used to help improve image quality. The camera software leverages artificial intelligence technologies such as object recognition for stabilization and performing automated enhancements to images (recognizing common scenes and photo subjects), while information from the various sensors and infrared is used for autofocus. The 24-megapixel front-facing camera also uses Light Fusion.
Software.
The P20 ships with Android 8.1 "Oreo" with Huawei's EMUI interface and software suite. In December 2018, Huawei began to roll out an upgrade to Android 9.0 "Pie" with EMUI 9.0, adding features such as screen gesture-based navigation, Digital Balance (a dashboard for tracking and limiting device usage), HiVision (an augmented reality object recognition experience for the camera), and Password Vault among other features.
In mid-2019, the P20 received a system update with EMUI 9.1 (introduced on its successor, the P30), which features performance improvements, including use of Huawei's Extendable Read-Only File System (EROFS) for system partitions), updates to the GPU Turbo mode, and other refinements. An update to Android 10 and EMUI 10 was later released; it is not planned to be updated to EMUI 10.1.
Reception.
"CNET" praised the design of the P20 Pro, noting that its "Twilight" color finish was reminiscent of when phones "dared to look different" in the early 2000s, but that its glass backing was likely to attract fingerprints. The P20 Pro's cameras were deemed to be competitive with other high-end devices, with low-light images being "consistently detailed", and having quality that exceeded those of the Samsung Galaxy S9+. However, it was argued that the automatic enhancement mode often resulted in oversaturated and unnatural-looking photos. NDTV noted that the P20 range lacked wireless charging or a 1440p display like its competition, and that the P20 Pro's Kirin 970 system-on-chip was comparable to the Snapdragon 835, but slightly behind the Exynos 9810 of the Samsung Galaxy S9 on CPU benchmarks. On graphics benchmarks, the P20 Pro was shown to have a frame rate advantage over its competitors due to its lower resolution. In conclusion, the S9 was deemed to be a better "all-round" phone, but the P20 Pro was best for users who wanted the "most versatile" cameras of a current smartphone.
"The Verge" similarly praised its design for having many subtle details and a "satisfying sense of density that only Apple's iPhone X can match". Its display was considered to be competitive with those of the iPhone X and Galaxy S9, also noting its inclusion of display temperature adjustment based on lighting conditions, similarly to Apple's "True Tone" feature. Huawei's software was considered to be less "irritating" than Samsung Experience, and maturing beyond being a clone of iOS, although bugs were noted in its handling of the display notch on the stock software. The P20 Pro's cameras were deemed the company's best to-date, to have "shockingly impressive low-light performance" (outperforming the Pixel 2), and a long-exposure "Night" mode that "somehow manages to produce handheld photos that remain sharp, accurate, and practically noise-free", but noting Huawei's aggressive post-processing, and that the "Master AI" mode was inconsistent. In conclusion, it was argued that "Instead of gimmicks and gaudiness, the Huawei P20 Pro delivers refinement and efficiency. That's a major change for Huawei, which could previously be relied upon to be the fastest iPhone copycat in the East."
DxOMark found that the P20 Pro's cameras were "the biggest innovation we have seen in mobile imaging for quite some time" and "particularly good in low light, when zooming, and for bokeh simulation". Rating it on its camera benchmarks with a score of 109, it was, at the time, the highest score the site had ever awarded.

SOILED

SOILED is an architecture magazine released periodically that centers on architecture, design, and the interactions between humans and space. It incorporates the visual elements of design magazines and publishes original writing in the style of a literary magazine. It aims to break down boundaries between architects and non-architects through this combination. Its open submission format allows the publication "to extend the architectural dialogue beyond the community of the discipline to engage the larger public."
"SOILED" is produced out of the archizine tradition. This movement aims to "celebrate(s) and promote(s) the recent resurgence of alternative and independent architectural publishing from around the world." Archinect, a network of architecture professionals, said of the magazine, "SOILED gets its hands dirty unknitting the systems-fabric of the built environment's varied networks, through whatever collaborative means necessary."
The magazine, started in 2011, is based in Chicago, Illinois and published by the design practice Could Be Architecture. In 2013, the magazine pursued a Kickstarter campaign in order to fund production. There the team cited its mission as: "SOILED aims to push the potential of the printed page and reconnect with the materials and landscape from which its content originates." The magazine remains supported by donations at present. 
To date, the magazine has published seven issues — Groundscrapers, Skinscrapers, Platescrapers, Windowscrapers, Cloudscrapers, Deathscrapers, and Animatescrapers. The publication is run by an all-volunteer team and releases issues annually. 
It has been featured in exhibitions like Archzines and the Chicago Architecture Biennial. Issues and their releases have been featured in publications like Architizer and Coverjunkie.

Home Sweet Home (2017 video game)

Home Sweet Home is a single-player, first-person survival/horror/puzzle video game. It was developed by Thai developer Yggdrazil Group. The game features horror elements drawn from Thai folklore. It is available on Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and on VR devices. 
The game focuses on the main protagonist Tim through two episodes. His life has drastically changed since his wife mysteriously disappeared. One night, he wakes up in a room in an unknown apartment building. While trying to find an exit, he is chased by a young female ghost. Players have to discover the mystery within Tim's house and find his missing wife Jane.
Gameplay.
The game is about stealth and hiding. If the ghosts or demons find the player in their hiding spot, the player can do a quick time event to escape, or will otherwise be killed and the game will respawn to the last save point. Exploration is also important, which is complemented by the fact that many areas have no dangers. Instead, the goal is to find diary pages, informative articles, or puzzle items.
Plot.
The protagonist, a man named Tim, wakes up in an unfamiliar building unsure where his wife Jane is. Searching for her, he encounters a hostile female entity wielding a boxcutter that can teleport between pools of blood on the walls and floor. Escaping, he emerges from a stair cupboard in his own house. The whole thing had seemingly been a nightmare; Jane had gone missing some time before. Finding her diary, Tim goes back to the cupboard and he finds himself in a mysterious and dark wooden house mentioned in its pages. Trying to chase Jane, they are attacked and separated by a colossal hostile spirit called a Preta; a tortured soul being punished for its sins. Calming it with a food offering, Tim escapes to his home again finding it dark, ransacked, and Jane still missing. Finding a blood portal, Tim ends up in a haunted school chased by the female entity again, further hindered by numerous, normal-sized Pretas who alert her if they spot Tim.
Through notes, Tim learns that the entity, Belle, was an unstable and isolated student who fell in love with another student named Shane and put a lechery jinx on him to make him fall for her. However, the jinx backfired: she died leading Shane to commit suicide while Belle became a hostile ghost doomed to forever look for him. Using a hacksaw to cut through a blocked door and holy water to slow her down, Tim gets Belle to confront her deeds, allowing him to escape the school.
For the final segment of the first episode, the game switches to Jane's perspective, having been given a magical Penta-Metal knife by a novice monk to protect herself from the paranormal experiences haunting her, which Tim had not believed, forcing her to take matters into her own hands. Finding herself back in the wooden house, she is caught and dragged away by a hostile female entity in traditional Thai garb. 
The second episode starts with Tim waking up in his house, now normal again, with a solar eclipse set to occur. Still struggling to cope with Jane's disappearance with heavy drinking and ignoring calls from his best friend Dew, he blacks out and wakes up in a dark forest strewn with eviscerated animal carcasses left by Krasue, predatory floating heads with dangling entrails. Hostile, zombie-like entities also roam the forest, chasing Tim across a bridge that collapses. Waking up in an old music school, Tim is forced to confront Ratri, the woman ghost in traditional garb. A beautiful but vain girl in life, she had made a deal with a spirit to get the main role in a big performance, but when her honest and hardworking sister Tida got the role instead, she framed Tida for stealing, leading to her death. This betrayal caused her to be possessed and killed by the spirit, leaving her to haunt the school as a spiteful ghost. Ratri is dangerous, able to teleport by possessing the many dress mannequins around the school, but Tida's spirit aids Tim in defeating her with Jane's knife, although Tim is badly wounded and passes out.
Having been rescued and healed by the novice monk, Tim wakes up in a temple. The novice explains that Tim and Jane are in a limbo-like realm called Hindrance for souls who cannot yet move on to the afterlife, but he urges Tim to return home and leave Jane citing that her fate cannot be changed. While chasing Jane again, Tim encounters Chai, an occultist who uses the Hindrance to trap and collect the souls of sinners for use in a ritual in conjunction with the eclipse to open the gates of Hell itself and obtain incredible power. Jane's knife proves ineffective and Chai's blind but powerful minion, the Executioner, attacks, cutting off two of Tim's fingers and shattering the knife. The Monk reforges it into a more powerful Nona-metal knife with Tim's help finding components, and Tim goes to confront Chai again but is captured and taken to an underground temple. Escaping, Tim barely manages to evade the Executioner, deafening him with gongs and shooting him with an old cannon, long enough to find Chai and stab him in the neck, embuing the knife and Tim's arm with additional power.
In a central chamber, Chai has collected the bodies of many grave sinners for use as blood sacrifices to open the portal, including Belle and Ratri. Here, Tim briefly reunites with Jane but Chai, fused into the Executioner's body, attacks and mortally wounds her. Tim defeats him once again and shares one last goodbye with Jane before being forced to flee as the Temple begins to collapse. Chai's disembodied head pursues Tim, but he escapes the Hindrance at last with the assistance of the Novice. Finding himself at his house, Tim finally answers Dew's call and accepts his offer to come over. Just before the credits roll, however, Tim shows his arm still retains whatever powers he obtained.
Development.
"Home Sweet Home" is developed by Yggdrazil Group, a visual effects company primarily working on film post-production. 
This is the company's first venture into game development; the project was led by Sarut Tubloy. Development took about 2 years, and went through multiple major revisions.
The team originally planned to make a mobile game, but changed to PC and restarted work after 7–8 months. They made another revision at 15 months, after receiving feedback from Steam Greenlight. They made another revision after releasing a demo on 16 November, 2016, spending an extra three months on revising the story.
"Home Sweet Home" has been planned as a series, and the story was written with possible sequels in mind.

The level ends when a shelf blocks the exit, followed by the aforementioned ghost girl providing a jump scare.
Full game release.
The full game was released on Steam on 27 September 2017. It offers 4 hours of gameplay.
Reception.

List of Drexel Dragons in the NBA draft

The Drexel Dragons men's basketball team, representing Drexel University, has had 7 players drafted into the National Basketball Association (NBA) since the league began holding drafts in 1947.
Each NBA franchise seeks to add new players through an annual draft. The NBA uses a draft lottery to determine the first three picks of the NBA draft; the 14 teams that did not make the playoffs the previous year are eligible to participate. After the first three picks are decided, the rest of the teams pick in reverse order of their win–loss record. To be eligible for the NBA Draft, a player in the United States must be at least 19 years old during the calendar year of the draft and must be at least one year removed from the graduation of his high school class. From 1967 until the ABA–NBA merger in 1976, the American Basketball Association (ABA) held its own draft.

<doc id="56956514" url="?curid=56956514" title="Nankai Institute of Economics">
Nankai Institute of Economics

Nankai Institute of Economics (, abbreviated NKIE), founded in 1927 by He Lian and Zhang Boling, was originally named Nankai Committee of Sociology and Economics. It changed its name into Nankai Institute of Economics in 1931, and then established the tenet of the institute, which is to "know China and serve China". The systematic social research that the institute has conducted was ahead of its time in China. The Nankai Price Index, compiled in 1927, was the very first price index in China and the most important reference to the study of Chinese economy during that time, indicating that it was rather influential and of high academic value. The institute was then regarded as the authority of Chinese economic studies during the period of Republic of China (1912–1949).
Nankai Institute of Economics is now affiliated to the School of Economics, and located at the Balitai campus of Nankai University, Nankai District, Tianjin.
History.
Early stage.
In 1926, He Lian returned to China after receiving his doctor's degree from Yale University, and was offered a position by Zhang Boling, the principal of Nankai University, and Tao Menghe, the head of the social research's department of China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture. Tao Menghe invited He Lian to be the research adviser for the department. Although he declined the offer, He Lian was still interested in the idea and proposed to Zhang Boling that an independent research organization should be established, which was approved by Zhang Boling.
On September 10, 1927, Nankai Committee of Sociology and Economics was founded under the support of Zhang Boling and He Lian, and it was the previous form of Nankai Institute of Economics. Its office was set in Xiushan Hall, Balitai. He Lian took the position of chief adviser of the committee. Because it was considered a specialized research institution, the committee focused its early studies on two aspects, the collection of books, journals and other materials about Chinese economy, written in Chinese and other languages, as well as the compilation of an anthology of Chinese economics which included editing and analyzing the statistics of Chinese economy. In 1928, Fang Xianting, a fellow student of He Lian's, returned to China to support Nankai University after receiving his doctorate of economics from Yale. He was officially employed as the chief researcher of the committee. Influence by Fang Xianting, the committee shifted its focus to the study of "the degree and the impact of China's industrialization" in the Tianjin region, which is China's first systematic research on social economics and earliest empirical research of economics.
Development.
In 1931, Nankai Committee of Sociology and Economics, together with Economic Studies under the School of Arts, formed the School of Economics, and the committee started to take on the role of an educational facility as well. From 1931 onwards, Nankai Institute of Economics made progress with impressive research results and its research conditions improved because of it. In the spring of 1934, the department of education of the nationalist government refused to register the School of Economics as an official institution and demanded its reorganization because the name of the school violated the regulations about "organizing university". Nankai University, therefore, had to withdraw the use of the name "School of Economics" in its official documents, and reuse the "Business School". The Economic Studies, which was previously subordinate to the School of Arts, was affiliated to the Business School. Meanwhile, because of other regulations on the establishment of institutes, the university set up "the Economic Department of Business School Institute", i.e., "Nankai Institute of Economics" (abbreviated NKIE). Later, Nankai did not follow up on the regulations of the government's department of education. Although it kept the accepted names in its official reports to the government, the university remained using the "School of Economics" and "Nankai Institute of Economics" in other occasions. The journal "Nankai Index" was created in the same year, and it received much attention from the academia in China and in other countries, because the journal was a reflection of Chinese economy at that period. In July 1935, NKIE started to accept postgraduate students, which were the first ones educated in China to receive master's degree of economics that were officially admitted by the department of education. In 1935, six institutions, including NKIE, Peking Union Medical College, Yenching University, Tsinghua University, University of Nanking, and China's Association for Mass Education, jointly established the "Association of Northern China's Countrysides Establishment", which was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. He Lian was appointed as the chairman of the association and Fang Xianting the secretary. NKIE was then responsible for the training of people who could manage local governments, their financial problems and other cooperation organizations.
During the second Sino-Japanese war.
In 1936, before the war started, Zhang Boling took precautionary measures in case that Nankai University was assaulted by the Japanese army. Before the army took over Tianjin, Nankai Institute of Economics was relocated to the underground floor of Zhongshu Library in Chongqing Nankai Secondary School, and 21,000 books and research materials, which had been collected for the last dozen years, were put into 127 boxes and shipped towards south before the university was bombed. After years of transportation through Hong Kong, Haiphong and several other places, the boxes eventually arrived in Chongqing in 1940.On July 29, 1937, Nankai University was bombed by the Japanese army. The office of NKIE at Xiushan Hall was destroyed, but none of the faculty members were injured or dead. Since Nankai University and other universities coalesced and formed National Southwestern Associated University, NKIE then changed its name into Economic Studies under the Business School Institute of National Southwestern Associated University. By 1939, the institute had been reestablished at the library of Chongqing Nankai Secondary School, and it had also set up an agency in Kunming (where the Associated University was located).
During the Chinese civil war.
In April 1946, Chiang Kai-shek signed the proposal to transform Nankai University from a private school into a national public university. On May 4, National Southwestern Associated University held its annual graduation ceremony. It then announced the disintegration of the university on July 31, and Nankai University moved back to Tianjin and resumed its operation. In December, NKIE returned to Tianjin, but many funds that it previously received from abroad such as Rockefeller Foundation and Institute of the Pacific Relations had stopped because of its status as a public university. The researches were therefore influenced due to the lack of financial support.
In September 1947, after leaving the Kuomintang government, He Lian and Fang Xianting established an independent "Chinese Economic Research Institute" in Shanghai on the support of Zhou Zuomin and Dai Zimu, the chairman and the associate manager of Kincheng Banking Corporation, in order to retain the personnel of NKIE. This institute acted as a branch of NKIE, with Fang Xianting as its director, while the members were mostly previous employees at NKIE and other graduate students of NKIE.
From 1949 onwards.
After 1949, since Marxian economics gained traction in mainland China, He Lian, Fang Xianting and other founders moved abroad one after another. Because it used to receive funds from foreign organizations like Rockefeller Foundation, Nankai Institute of Economics became a target of political oppression. It was demanded to be reformed, while many faculty members received unfair treatment. In 1952, after the reformation of higher education institutions, NKIE once stopped operating. In 1958, Hebei's Institute of Economics of Chinese Academy of Sciences was established on the basis of the old NKIE, but it was still located inside the campus of Nankai University. The independent Hebei's Institute of Economics kept its academic communication with the School of Economics of Nankai University, and many academic conferences were held among these institutions.
In May 1959, the prime minister Zhou Enlai visited Nankai University, and he was in support of the operation of NKIE. He asked, "why won't He Lian return to China? He has every right to come back." Besides this, Zhou Enlai also asked people to send his regards to He Lian and invite him to return when he met with guests from abroad. In 1962, Hebei's Institute of Economics was to be shut down, and Zhou Enlai instructed Nankai University to take over it and change its name back to Nankai Institute of Economics, with the director of the School of Economics Ji Taoda as its director, and both the dean of the School of Economics Teng Weizao and the associate director Tao Jikan as its associate directors. The institute then set up four research branches, i.e. Socialist Economy, U.S. Economy, Oceania Economy and History of Modern China's Economy.
During the Cultural Revolution, the research at NKIE was often put into halts, and the research branches did not resume their works until 1973. In December 1979, "Political Economics: Socialist Part", edited by the director of NKIE Gu Shutang, was officially published and became the widely-used textbook of economics among the universities in the northern China, so it was called the "northern edition". This book broke the frame of a typical Soviet Union's textbook, absorbed the newest research results and went through several revisions. It was then considered an influential volume by the educational sphere of economics in China. In 1984, NKIE started to work on the major state research project "the formation of planned price" and was authorized to grant doctorates to students.
In 1987, the subdivision of Global Economy of NKIE became a separate Nankai Institute of International Economy. In 1988, proposed by the geographer Bao Juemin, the director of the Cultural Geography Studies of the Geographical Society of China, NKIE opened a new research branch of Economic Geography, which was the first research facility of economic geography set under an institute of economics. From 1994 to 1998, Chen Zongsheng took the position of the director of NKIE and focused the research on the problems of individual incomes and the transformation of economic system in developing countries. In 2002, the research branch of Urban and Regional Economy became the independent Institute of Urban and Regional Economy.
On September 10, 2012, Nankai Institute of Economics celebrated its 85 years of operation. In October 2017, the previous director Chen Zongsheng won the eighth China's Economic Theory Innovation Award for his theory of "income distribution in China's economic transformation and development".
Academic researches.
He Lian, the founder of NKIE, believes that price is the center of all economic activities according to the theory of economics, while statistics and price index are "the barometer of economy" to observe the changing price and "examine the purchasing power of the currency", which should be "referred to when doing business". When Nankai Committee of Sociology and Economics was first established in September 1927, they decided to start their research with the compilation of a wholesale price index in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. As the institute grew larger and the research area expanded, the index began to include quantity of import and export commodities and wholesale price in China; rate of foreign currencies in Tianjin and Shanghai; price of domestic currency, price of silver, customer price, price of essential commodities and living cost in Shanghai; wholesale price and living cost of workers in Tianjin; salary in large cities and counties; price of commodities in Chongqing during wartime, income of teachers, living costs of landlords, businessmen and workers in Chongqing; and industrial productivity in Northern China during wartime. Many of these indexes were important guides to study the economy in China during that period. For instance, the English economic historian Richard H. Tawney wrote "Land and Labor in China" during his visit to China from 1929 to 1930, making use of the materials and research results of NKIE.

Sally Fox (inventor)

Sally Fox (born 1959) is a cotton breeder who breeds naturally colored varieties of cotton. She is the inventor of FoxFibre and founder of the company Natural Cotton Colours Inc. Fox invented the first species of environmentally friendly colored cotton that could be spun into thread on a machine.
Fox has been called a "cotton pioneer" for her efforts regarding organic, colored cotton and heirloom wheat.
Early life and education.
Fox was the sixth of seven children, born in 1959 in Woodside, California to two real estate agents. At the age of seven, her family moved to Menlo Park.
Fox first became interested in cotton fibers at the age of 12. After purchasing her first spindle with babysitting money, she created various threads of cotton from household objects such as linen.
In high school, an entomology teacher and then Stanford Ph.D. student, Elizabeth Wangari, inspired Fox to take an interest in insects. Wangari helped Fox secure an internship at Zoecon Corporation in Palo-Alto. Fox went on to major in biology and entomology at California State Polytechnic University at San Luis Obispo.
After graduation, Fox joined the Peace Corps and travelled to The Gambia, West Africa in order to learn about the environmental factors harming local rice and peanut crops. It was here that Fox was first exposed, both socially and physically, to the dangers of pesticides such as DDT. Fox taught safety classes regarding the usage of pesticides but was forced to return home after becoming very sick (due to exposure). After her stint in the Peace Corps, Fox furthered her education by earning a master's degree in integrated pest management from the University of California at Riverside.
Inspiration to grow colored cotton.
In the early 1980s, Fox began looking for a job. However, the economic downfall of the farming industry during this time period created a sparse job market. Fox first found work as a pollinator for a cotton breeder in California. During this job, Fox discovered a bag of seeds that produced brown, pest-resistant cotton. After a suggestion from her employer, Fox spun out the cotton and left her job so as to plant her first fields of naturally colored cotton.
Natural Cotton Colors Inc..
Fox is the founder and owner of the company Natural Cotton Colors Inc. Fox's breakthrough occurred in 1988 at Texas Tech University when she successfully produced her first species of naturally colored cotton that could be spun on a machine. After a sale with a Japanese textile mill, Fox quit her job at Sandoz Crop Protection and founded Natural Cotton Colors Inc., setting up base in Wasco, California.
Fox's second major sale occurred in 1989, when she sold 122 bushels of cotton to a different Japanese mill for $279,000. Following these sales, Fox obtained Plant Variety Protection Certificates (the equivalent of patents for plants) and trademarked her cotton brand: FoxFibre. Not long after, L.L. Bean and Land's End put in significant orders for FoxFibre. Fox's business, Natural Cotton Colours, soon became a company/business worth $10 million.
However, Sally Fox and FoxFibre faced many obstacles in order to produce their cotton. Southern California cotton growers, who feared the crop would contaminate their own produce, pushed for re-enforcement of early 20th-century legislation that placed strict laws on Fox's growing process and her fields. In 1993, she relocated to Arizona. But in 1999, Arizona cotton growers pushed for similar laws on Fox's fields, causing Fox to relocate once again, this time to Northern California. The company faced further barriers when, between 1990 and 1995, a majority of the spinning mills in Europe, Japan and the United States closed down, possibly in efforts to promote globalization and industrialization.
FoxFibre.
FoxFibre is the patented name of Fox's various breeds of naturally colored, organically grown cotton. Different colors available for textile industries, including Redwood, Coyote, New Green, and Buffalo.
Fox herself weeded, maintained, and grew cotton, each year harvesting and breeding only the best in color and in fiber. Fox even crossbred her brown cotton with traditional white cotton so as to produce crops with longer, stronger fibers for threading. Each color of cotton takes approximately ten years of cross-breeding before it can be sold on the market. Her work mirrors, and pushed for more innovation in, the scientific field of genetic engineering.
Legacy.
While Fox was not the first person to invent nor harvest naturally colored cotton, she was the first to invent a species of naturally colored cotton that could be spun into thread via machine. Naturally colored cotton has short, weak fibers that traditionally required hours upon hours of expensive hand threading. White cotton has stronger, longer fibers that are able to be threaded by a machine. However, the bleaching process of the white cotton is not environmentally friendly, creating large amounts of pollution as a byproduct. Fox's cotton was a gateway for the textile industry to see how good quality clothes could be made while prioritizing the health of the environment. Furthermore, Fox grows all her cotton without pesticides or chemical pesticides, further promoting and encouraging farmers and textile industries to grow environmentally friendly products.
Fox and her work has been featured in "Civil Eats", "Core77", the "Sacramento Bee", and "Popular Mechanics".

Malabar Cements Limited

Malabar Cements Limited is an Indian cement company. It is among the largest public sector cement production undertakings. It is fully owned by the Government of Kerala and is the only major integrated cement plant in the State. The total installed capacity of MCL is 6.2 lakh tons. This ISO 9001:2000 company is responsible for about 10% of total cement production in Kerala.
History.
In 1961-62, the Geological Survey of India located a limestone deposit in the Pandarethu valley of the Walayar region on the northern side of the Palakkad gap. Located in a dense forest, the hilly terrain required heavy investment. The state government was interested in building a cement factory. In 1975 a feasibility study was completed. In 1976 an industrial license for the manufacture of cement was obtained.
The Company was incorporated on 11 April 1978 and commenced cement production at its Walayar plant in April 1984.
An expansion program added a 2.0 lakh ton clinker-grinding unit at Cherthala in Alappuzha district in August 2003.
A 2.5MW multi-fuel power plant for Walayar was commissioned in June 1998.
Development of the Cherthala plant began in August 2003 as part of an expansion plan by the company that included commissioning a 600 tpd Grinding Unit.
Plant.
The total installed capacity of MCL is 8.6 lakh tons.
Walayar plant.
With a production capacity of 6.6 lakh tonnes of cement per annum, this unit is its largest one.

This plant includes a 600 tpd Grinding Unit. A two lakhs tonnes clinker grinding unit is there.
Corruption case.
ARK Woods and Metals Ltd., entered into a contract with MCL, for fly ash for a period of nine years. MCL chose to cancel the contract. As a result, MCL incurred a loss of 52.5 lakh. Company managing director K. Padmakumar and marketing manager G. Venugopal were arrested by the VACB on charges of corruption and malpractice.
In 2007, the Comptroller and Auditor General unearthed a scam of Rs 400 crore. Saseendran was the prime witness. Two years later, he wrote to the Chief Minister and Vigilance department head informing them about the corruption. Following intimidation he resigned and two days after a charge sheet was filed in the case, Saseendran was found dead. The accused in his death were then Industries Minister Elamaram Kareem and then Managing Director Sundara Moorthy and his secretary Sooryanarayanan, VM Radhakrishnan, a private contractor with MCL.

Plant genetic resources

Plant genetic resources are plant genetic materials of actual or potential value. They describe the variability within plants that comes from human and natural selection over millennia. Their intrinsic value mainly concerns agricultural crops.
According to the 1983 revised International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), plant genetic resources are defined as "the entire generative and vegetative reproductive material of species with economical and/or social value, especially for the agriculture of the present and the future, with special emphasis on nutritional plants".
In the State of the World’s Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (1998) the FAO defined Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA) as "the diversity of genetic material contained in traditional varieties and modern cultivars as well as crop wild relatives and other wild plant species that can be used now or in the future for food and agriculture".
History.
The first use of plant genetic resources dates to more than 10,000 years ago, when farmers selected from the genetic variation they found in wild plants to develop their crops. As human populations moved to different climates and ecosystems, taking the crops with them, the crops adapted to the new environments, developing, for example, genetic traits providing tolerance to conditions such as drought, water logging, frost and extreme heat. These traits - and the plasticity inherent in having wide genetic variability - are important properties of plant genetic resources.
In recent centuries, although humans had been prolific in collecting exotic flora from all corners of the globe to fill their gardens, it wasn’t until the early 20th century that the widespread and organized collection of plant genetic resources for agricultural use began in earnest. Russian geneticist Nikolai Vavilov, considered by some as the father of plant genetic resources, realized the value of genetic variability for breeding and collected thousands of seeds during his extensive travels to establish one of the first gene banks. Vavilov inspired the American Jack Harlan to collect seeds from across the globe for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). David Fairchild, another botanist at USDA, successfully introduced many important crops (e.g. cherries, soybeans, pistachios) into the United States.
It wasn’t until 1967 that the term "genetic resources" was coined by Otto Frankel and Erna Bennett at the historic International Conference on Crop Plant Exploration and Conservation, organized by the FAO and the International Biological Program (IBP) “The effective utilization of genetic resources requires that they are adequately classified and evaluated” was a key message from the conference.
Conservation.
Plant genetic resource conservation has become increasingly important as more plants have become threatened or rare. At the same time, an exploding world population and rapid climate change have led humans to seek new resilient and nutritious crops. Plant conservation strategies generally combine elements of conservation on farm (as part of the crop production cycle, where it continues to evolve and support farmer needs), "ex situ" (for example in gene banks or field collections as seed or tissue samples) or "in situ" (where they grow in the wild or protected areas). Most "in situ" conservation concerns crop wild relatives, an important source of genetic variation to crop breeding programs. 
Plant genetic resources that are conserved by any of these methods are often referred to as germplasm, which is a shorthand term meaning "any genetic materials". The term originates from germ plasm, August Weismann's theory that heritable information is transmitted only by germ cells, and which has been superseded by modern insights on inheritance, including epigenetics and non-nuclear DNA.
After the Second World War, efforts to conserve plant genetic resources came mainly from breeders’ organizations in the USA and Europe, which led to crop-specific collections primarily located in developed countries (e.g. IRRI, CIMMYT). In the 1960s and 1970s, more focus was put on the collection and conservation of plant genetic resources in face of genetic erosion by organizations such as the Rockefeller Foundation and the European Society of Breeding Research (EUCARPIA).
A key event in the conservation of plant genetic resources was the establishment of the International Board for Plant Genetic Resources (IBPGR) (now Bioversity International) in 1974, whose mandate was "to promote and assist in the worldwide effort to collect and conserve the plant germplasm needed for future research and production". IBPGR mobilized scientists to create a global network of gene banks, thus marking the international recognition of the importance of plant genetic resources.
In 2002, the Global Crop Diversity Trust was established by Bioversity International on behalf of the CGIAR and the FAO through a Crop Diversity Endowment Fund. The goal of the Trust is to provide a secure and sustainable source of funding for the world's most important "ex situ" crop collections.
Further conservation efforts for plant genetic resources is needed. A 2016 global study of over 1000 crop wild relative species assessed 70% as high priority for further collecting to improve their representation in seedbanks, noting that 29% were completely missing from "ex situ" conservation. A 2020 study found that 93.3% of crop wild relatives native to the United States were poorly represented in "ex situ" conservation repositories, while 93.1% were inadequately conserved in their natural habitats.
Policy.
In response to the growing awareness of the global value of and threat to biological diversity, the United Nations drafted the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the first global multilateral treaty focused on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Article 15 of the CBD specified that countries have national sovereignty over their genetic resources, but that there should be facilitated access and benefit sharing (ABS) under mutually agreed terms and with prior informed consent.
Going further to protect national sovereignty of plant genetic resources, an instrumental piece of legislation, The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA), was adopted by the FAO in November 2001 and came into force in 2004.
The ITPGRFA established several mechanisms under the Multilateral System, which grants free access and equitable use of 64 of the world’s most important crops (Annex 1 crops) for some uses (research, breeding and training for food and agriculture). The treaty prevents the recipients of genetic resources from claiming intellectual property rights over those resources in the form in which they received them, and ensures that access to genetic resources is consistent with international and national laws. This is facilitated by the Standard Material Transfer Agreement, a mandatory contract between providers and recipients for the exchange of germplasm under the Multilateral System. The Governing Body of the treaty, through FAO as the Third Party Beneficiary, has an interest in the agreements.
The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization is a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity that was adopted in 2010 and enforced in 2014. It provides greater legal transparency to policies governing fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources.
Issues and controversies.
Due to the high value and complexity of plant genetic resources and the number of parties involved globally, some issues have arisen over their conservation and use.
Much of the material for breeding programs was collected from the Southern hemisphere and sent to gene banks in the Northern hemisphere, a concern that led to more emphasis on the national sovereignty of plant genetic resources and instigated policies that addressed the imbalance.
The increased use of plant genetic information for research, for example to find genes of interest for drought tolerance, has led to controversy on whether and to what extent the genetic data (separate from the organism) are subject to the international ABS regulations described above.
Forest genetic resources represent a specific case of plant genetic resources.

Old Lyme Historic District

The Old Lyme Historic District encompasses the historic village center of Old Lyme, Connecticut. Located mainly on Lyme Street south of Interstate 95, the village, settled in the mid-17th century, has an architectural history dating to the early 18th century, flourishing as a shipbuilding center and home to many ship captains. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.
Description and history.
Old Lyme was one of the early settlement areas of the Puritan Saybrook Colony in the 17th century, and was the early town center of Lyme. It separated from that community as South Lyme in 1855, and eventually renamed itself Old Lyme. The village center has since the early days been arrayed along what is now called Lyme Street, which runs parallel to the Lieutenant River shortly before its mouth at the Connecticut River. The village flourished in the 18th and 19th centuries as a shipbuilding center, and was home to the Old Lyme Art Colony in the late 19th century. The artistic legacy is continued by the presence of the Lyme Art Association and the Lyme Academy College of Fine Arts in the village.
The historic district extends along Lyme Street, roughly from the junction with I-95 southward to McCurdy Street, and then a short way along that roadway. It also includes a few buildings north of I-95, including the Old Lyme Inn and the Florence Griswold House and Museum, the historic center of the art colony. The town's civic buildings are located in the village, including the town hall and library. Houses in the district range across the architectural spectrum from the early 18th century to the late 19th century, and including the Peck Tavern on Sill Lane, an 18th-century tavern that is now a private residence.

Chibok ambush

The Chibok ambush was an attack of Boko Haram insurgents against a Nigerian Army convoy in the night from 13 to 14 May 2014, as the latter was searching for schoolgirls who had been kidnapped by the Islamist rebels. Even though the Nigerian Army forces managed to extricate themselves from the ambush, the attack seriously affected the morale of the involved soldiers who felt that their leadership was carelessly sacrificing them in the war against the insurgents. As result, elements of the Nigerian Army's 7th Division subsequently mutinied at Maiduguri and almost killed their own commander, "humiliat[ing] the Nigerian military".
Background.
The Salafi jihadist Boko Haram movement launched an insurgency against the Nigerian government following an unsuccessful uprising in 2009. Supported by several other Jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda, the group uses raids, assaults, and ambushes to terrorize its civilian opponents and destabilize the government with the ultimate goal of establishing an Islamic state in northern Nigeria. Boko Haram considers all "Western or secular ideas [...] heretical and worthy of attack", and thus often targets Western-influenced schools. Its most infamous attack in this regard was the abduction of 276 female students in Chibok on 14 April 2014.
Due to numerous problems affecting the Nigerian Armed Forces, including rampant corruption among its leadership, the Nigerian Army has found it extremely difficult to adapt to Boko Haram's guerilla warfare and defeat the insurgency. In response to the Chibok kidnapping, the Nigerian military intensified its counter-insurgency campaign in Borno State, but enjoyed little success. Often lacking even basic necessities, such as weapons, ammunition, pay, and food, the soldiers involved in these operations became increasingly dissatisfied and demoralized over time. Believing that they were being "killed like rats by the insurgents", they felt left alone or even betrayed by their commanders.
Ambush.
On early 13 May 2014, pro-government militias from three villages in the Kala/Balge area repelled a major Boko Haram raid, allegedly killing up to 200 insurgents, as well as capturing some fighters and military equipment. Upon learning of this, the Nigerian Army's 7th Division sent some of its forces from Maiduguri to Kala/Balge on a "special operation". The soldiers gathered some of the captured Boko Haram materiel from the locals, who relayed to them "misleading", "faulty and unverified information" about the possible location of the kidnapped schoolgirls from Chibok. Upon learning of this, the general officer commanding the 7th Division, Major General Ahmadu Mohammed, promptly ordered the soldiers in the field to either to return to their base at Maiduguri or to conduct a patrol to search for the abductees.
By then, the 7th Division troops in question were in Chibok and protested against this order, as this would force them to move through the wilderness at night, exposing them to possible Boko Haram attacks. They pleaded with their officers to spend the night at one of the villages. The commanders in the field consequently called Major General Ahmadu Mohammed for permission to do so, but were overruled. Told that "the top ranks at the headquarters of the 7 Division would not be pleased if they don't go back to Maiduguri that night", the 7th Division forces then started to advance along the road to Maiduguri. Boko Haram had received intel about the Nigerian Army convoy, however, and prepared an ambush near Chibok.
Several Boko Haram fighters hid on either side of the road, while others formed support and security units; the former were supposed to aid the attack on the Nigerian Army convoy, while the latter ensured that the ambushing fighters were not surprised by possible government reinforcements. The insurgents waited until the military convoy had entered the kill zone, whereupon they launched their assault. Several soldiers were killed or wounded until the Nigerian Army troops managed to break through. The insurgents then retreated via planned routes, while the convoy continued to travel to Maiduguri. The Nigerian military initially claimed that only four soldiers had been killed, but independent sources confirmed that 12 had been killed and numerous others wounded. One of the dead was a commanding officer, Major Olalekan Akintola. According to the government, several attackers had also been killed during the fighting.
Aftermath.
Though the Nigerian soldiers had managed to overcome the ambush, the Boko Haram assault had serious repercussions for the 7th Division's morale, which had already been low. Since this insurgent attack had happened just as they had feared, the surviving troops blamed Major General Ahmadu Mohammed for carelessly ordering them to move at night and for having needlessly sacrificed their comrades. When the convoy arrived at Maiduguri, word about the events quickly spread and anger mounted among the entire 7th Division.
When Ahmadu Mohammed came to Maiduguri to pay respect to the fallen soldiers and address his forces, the situation escalated. Outraged, several soldiers started to fire into the air or threw stones at the major general's car. Eventually, some of those who had survived the ambush even shot at the commander, barely missing him. Some of Ahmadu Mohammed's bodyguards were hit and wounded. The situation was later brought back under control, and 18 soldiers were arrested and court-martialed. Charged for "mutiny, criminal conspiracy, attempted murder, disobeying orders, insubordination and false accusation", all pleaded not guilty. Five were discharged from the army, one was sentenced to hard labor, and 12 were sentenced to death for trying to murder Ahmadu Mohammed and inciting mutiny.
The ambush near Chibok and subsequent mutiny at Maiduguri received international attention and "humiliated the Nigerian military". The incident was judged to be "a big blow at a time when the nation is rallying behind the military to rescue the abducted schoolgirls". Major General Ahmadu Mohammed was subsequently replaced by General M. Y. Ibrahim as GOC of the 7th Division. Nevertheless, the situation for the soldiers in the campaign against Boko Haram did not markedly improve. As result, 7th Division soldiers in Maiduguri again mutinied just three months after the Chibok ambush.

IPad (6th generation)

The iPad 9.7-inch (officially iPad (6th generation)) is a tablet computer designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It was announced on March 27, 2018, during an education-focused event at Lane Tech High School in Chicago and is the successor to the 5th generation, upgraded with the Apple A10 Fusion SoC and support for styluses such as Apple Pencil. The iPad is also marketed towards educators and schools.
Since its introduction, this model iPad has been used by Apple Retail employees at the Genius Bar and by other employees to assist with customer queries. Since September 2019, the seventh-generation iPad has replaced the 2018 iPad.
Specifications.
The iPad shipped with iOS 11.3, and had the iWork suite of apps preinstalled and included Apple Pencil stylus support.
The iPad's hardware is nearly identical to the previous generation, except for a few upgrades, such as Apple Pencil and stylus support and an upgraded processor, the Apple A10 Fusion. It is available in three colors: Silver, Space Gray, and a new Gold color to match the updated color introduced with the iPhone 8. The iPad has 2 gigabytes of RAM. It is 7.5mm thick. The iPad is available in 32 and 128 GB storage options. Unlike the iPad Pro, the iPad does not feature a laminated display.
Reception.
The 2018 iPad received positive reviews. Gareth Beavis of "TechRadar" praised the addition of the Apple Pencil and the powerful A10 chip, but noted that it was as costly as the previous generation iPad. Scott Stein of "CNET" also praised the addition of support for Apple Pencil and the upgrade to the A10 chip, but criticized it for lacking the Smart Connector as well as not having the same display technology as the iPad Pro, writing "the 2018 entry-level iPad doesn't add much, but it makes an already excellent tablet a better buy than ever."

Development.
Initially, it was planned to commence filming in February. However, it was delayed to July due to reservation issues from the resort for the initial schedule. After finalizing the cast and locations, filming commenced on 13 June 2017. The majority of the scenes were shot in L. Reveries. In February 2017, it was confirmed that Mariyam Azza and Ibrahim Jihad will star in the film. After announcing the project, Nahula stated that, with "Bos" she will launch a "fresh face" to the industry and is "hunting for a director". On 8 March 2017, during the premier event of the film "Vishka", Nahula offered actress Aishath Rishmy to direct the film, which she accepted on 10 April 2017. Except for the lead actor, the rest of cast including Fathimath Azifa and Ali Azim were confirmed by the director on 2 June 2017. On 8 July 2017, it was revealed that actor Mohamed Yunaan will make his debut in this film.
Release and reception.
The poster of the film was unveiled on 8 July 2017. The soundtrack album and trailer of the film was released on 8 September 2020. Initially, it was planned to release the film on 24 September 2017, but the premier date was pushed further a week as it clashes with the second term examination period. The release date of the film was later finalized for 31 September 2017.
Upon release, the film received mixed reviews from critics. Aishath Fareeha from "Sun" applauded the work by director Aishath Rishmy for presenting a "predictable storyline from a stereotyped genre in an engaging manner" with commendable performances by Fathimath Azifa, Ibrahim Jihad and debutant Mohamed Yunaan. In a special mention Fareeha noted the comical role played by Ali Azim for saturating the film from being over-emotional. "Avas" in its film review criticized the film for its depressive nature and wrote: "Luckily, actors like Azifa, Jihad and Azim, with their brilliant performances, were able to save this titanic from sinking in an ocean of tears". Despite the mixed reviews, the film emerged as the highest grossing Maldivian film of 2017.

<doc id="56956816" url="?curid=56956816" title="Two-tree broadcast">
Two-tree broadcast

The two-tree broadcast (abbreviated 2tree-broadcast or 23-broadcast) is an algorithm that implements a broadcast communication pattern on a distributed system using message passing.
A broadcast is a commonly used collective operation that sends data from one processor to all other processors.
The two-tree broadcast communicates concurrently over two binary trees that span all processors. This achieves full usage of the bandwidth in the full-duplex communication model while having a startup latency logarithmic in the number of partaking processors.
The algorithm can also be adapted to perform a reduction or prefix sum.
Algorithm.
A broadcast sends a message from a specified root processor to all other processors.
"Binary tree broadcasting" uses a binary tree to model the communication between the processors.
Each processor corresponds to one node in the tree, and the root processor is the root of the tree.
To broadcast a message , the root sends to its two children (child nodes). Each processor waits until it receives and then sends to its children. Because leaves have no children, they don't have to send any messages.
The broadcasting process can be pipelined by splitting the message into blocks, which are then broadcast consecutively.
In such a binary tree, the leaves of the tree only receive data, but never send any data themselves. If the communication is bidirectional (full-duplex), meaning each processor can send a message and receive a message at the same time, the leaves only use one half of the available bandwidth.
The idea of the two-tree broadcast is to use two binary trees and and communicate on both concurrently.
The trees are constructed so that the interior nodes of one tree correspond to leaf nodes of the other tree.
The data that has to be broadcast is split into blocks of equal size.
In each step of the algorithm, each processor receives one block and sends the previous block to one of its children in the tree in which it is an interior node.
A schedule is needed so that no processor has to send or receive two messages in the same step.
To create such a schedule, the edges of both trees are colored with 0 and 1 such that
Edges with color 0 are used in even steps, edges with color 1 are used in odd steps.
This schedule allows each processor to send one message and receive one message in each step, fully utilizing the available bandwidth.&lt;br&gt;
Assume that processor wants to broadcast a message. The two trees are constructed for the remaining processors. Processor sends blocks alternating to the roots of the two trees, so each tree broadcasts one half of the message.
Analysis.
Let be the number of processing elements (PE), numbered from to .
Construction of the trees.
Let .
 and can be constructed as trees of height , such that both trees form an in-order numbering of the processors, with the following method:&lt;br&gt;
With "shifting", is first constructed like , except that it contains an additional processor. Then is shifted by one position to the left and the leftmost leaf is removed.
With "mirroring", is the mirror image of (with the mirror axis between processors and ). Mirroring only works for even .
It can be proven that a coloring with the desired properties exists for all .
When mirroring is used to construct , each processor can independently compute the color of its incident edges in time.
Communication Time.
For this analysis, the following communication model is used: A message of size has a communication time of , independent on which processors communicate. represents the startup overhead to send the message, represents the transmission time per data element.
Suppose the message of size is split into blocks. Each communication step takes time .
Let be the height of the communication structure with the root at processor and the two trees below it. 
After steps, the first data block has reached every node in both trees. Afterwards, each processor receives one block in every step until it received all blocks.
The total number of steps is resulting in a total communication time of .
Using an optimal , the total communication time is .
Comparison to similar algorithms.
In a linear pipeline broadcast, the message is split into blocks. In each step, each processor receives one block from the processor and sends one block to the processor .
Linear pipeline has optimal throughput, but has a startup time in .
For large , the startup latency of the two-tree broadcast is faster.
Because both algorithms have optimal throughput, the two-tree algorithm is faster for a large numbers of processors.
A binomial tree broadcast communicates along a binomial tree. Each process receives the message that is broadcast (the root already has the message) and then sends the message to its children.
A binomial tree broadcast has only half the startup time of the two-tree broadcast, but a factor of more communication.
The binomial tree broadcast is faster than the two-tree broadcast for small messages, but slower for large messages.
A pipelined binary tree broadcast splits the message into blocks and broadcasts the blocks consecutively over a binary tree.
By using a "Fibonacci tree" instead of a simple balanced binary tree, the startup latency can be reduced to .
A Fibonacci tree of height consists of a root that has a Fibonacci tree of height as its left child and a Fibonacci tree of as its right child.
The pipelined Fibonacci tree broadcast has half the startup latency of the two-tree broadcast, but also only half of the throughput.
It is faster for small messages, while the two-tree broadcast is faster for large messages.
Usage for other communication primitives.
Reduction.
A reduction (codice_1 in the MPI standard) computes formula_1 where is a vector of length originally
available at processor and formula_2 is a binary operation that is associative, but not necessarily commutative.
The result is stored at a specified root processor .
Assume that or . 
In this case the communication is identical to the broadcast, except that the communication direction is reversed.
Each process receives two blocks from its children, reduces them with its own block, and sends the result to its parent.
The root takes turns receiving blocks from the roots of and and reduces them with its own data.
The communication time is the same as for the Broadcast and the amount of data reduced per processor is .&lt;br&gt;
If the reduce operation is commutative, the result can be achieved for any root by renumbering the processors.&lt;br&gt;
If the operation is not commutative and the root is not or , then is a lower bound for the communication time.
In this case, the remaining processors are split into two subgroups. The processors perform a reduction to the root and the processors perform a reduction to the root . Processor receives blocks alternating from the two roots of the subgroups.
Prefix sum.
A prefix sum (codice_2) computes formula_3 for each
processor where is a vector of length originally
available at processor and formula_2 is a binary associative operation.
Using an inorder binary tree, a prefix sum can be computed by first performing an up-phase in which each interior node computes a partial sum
formula_5 for left- and rightmost leaves and , 
followed by a down-phase in which prefixes of the form formula_6 are sent down the tree and allow each processor to
finish computing its prefix sum.
The communication in the up-phase is equivalent to a reduction to processor and the communication in the down-phase is equivalent to a broadcast from the processor .
The total communication time is about twice the communication time of the two-tree broadcast.
ESBT broadcast.
If is a power of two, there is an optimal broadcasting algorithm based on edge disjoint spanning binomial trees (ESBT) in a hypercube.
The hypercube, excluding the root , is split into ESBTs.
The algorithm uses pipelining by splitting the broadcast data into blocks.
Processor cyclically distributes blocks to the roots of the ESBTs and each ESBT performs a pipelined binary tree broadcast.
In step , each processor sends and receives one message along dimension .
The communication time of the algorithm is , so the startup latency is only one half of the startup latency of the two-tree broadcast.
&lt;br&gt;
The drawback of the ESBT broadcast is that it does not work for other values of and it cannot be adapted for (non-commutative) reduction or prefix sum.

Al-Adil ibn al-Sallar

Abu'l-Hasan Ali al-Adil ibn al-Sallar or al-Salar (; died 3 April 1154), usually known simply as Ibn al-Sal[l]ar, was a Fatimid commander and official, who served as the vizier of Caliph al-Zafir from 1149 to 1154. A capable and brave soldier, Ibn al-Sallar assumed senior gubernatorial positions, culminating in the governorship of Alexandria. From this position in 1149 he launched a revolt, along with his stepson Abbas ibn Abi al-Futuh. Defeating the army of the then vizier, Ibn Masal, he occupied Cairo and forced the young Caliph al-Zafir to appoint him vizier instead. A mutual disdain and hatred bound the two men thereafter, and the Caliph even conspired to have Ibn al-Sallar assassinated. During this tenure, Ibn al-Sallar restored order in the army and strove to halt Crusader attacks on Egypt, but with limited success. He was assassinated at the behest of his ambitious stepson Abbas, who succeeded him as vizier.
Early life.
Of Kurdish origin, Ibn al-Sallar grew up in Jerusalem, where his father was in the service of the local Artuqid governors. Al-Adil became a follower of the Shafi'i school of Sunni Islam.
Following the brief Fatimid recovery of Jerusalem in 1098, Ibn al-Sallar's father was kept in his position, and Ibn al-Sallar himself received his first official post, as commander of the elite mounted battalion ("ṣubyān al-ḥajar") belonging to the Fatimid army. Ibn al-Sallar distinguished himself in battle against the Crusaders, beginning a career that led him to the governorships of Upper Egypt, al-Buhayra, and Alexandria. In the latter post, he met Bullara, the widow of a Zirid prince who had died in exile in the city. To further his political ambitions, he soon married Bullara, and raised her son Abbas ibn Abi al-Futuh as his own.
Vizierate.
At the time of the death of Caliph al-Hafiz in October 1149, Ibn al-Sallar was governor of Alexandria, and his stepson Abbas was governor of the neighbouring district of al-Gharbiyya. Ibn al-Sallar had hoped to be named vizier by the new ruler al-Zafir, but the latter chose Ibn Masal instead. Infuriated, Ibn al-Sallar refused to accept the appointment, and together with Abbas conspired against Ibn Masal. When al-Zafir learned of this plot, he called upon assistance from the grandees of the realm in support of Ibn Masal, but they proved unwilling to. In the end, the Caliph provided Ibn Masal with his own funds to hire mercenaries for action against Ibn al-Sallar. Ibn al-Sallar entered Cairo on 10 December, and installed himself in the vizier's palace. For the moment al-Zafir was forced to submit to the new strongman, appointing him vizier and conferring him the honorific titles "al-Malik al-ʿĀdil" ("righteous ruler"), "al-Sayyid al-ʿAjal" ("most noble master"), "Amīr al-Juyūsh" ("commander of the armies"), "Sharaf al-Islām" ("glory of Islam"), "Kafī Quḍāt al-Muslimīn" ("protector of the Muslims' "qāḍīs""), and "Hādī Duʿāt al-Muʾminīn" ("guide of the believers' missionaries").
His position was not yet secure, as Ibn Masal was among the tribes of Upper Egypt, trying to raise additional troops. Furthermore, the Caliph was unreconciled to the new situation, and conspired to have Ibn al-Sallar killed. In retaliation, in January 1150 Ibn al-Sallar gathered the caliphal guard ("ṣibyān al-khāṣṣ"), an elite corps of cadets comprising the sons of high dignitaries and officials, and executed most of them, sending the rest to serve on the empire's frontiers. He then sent an army under his stepson Abbas, along with Tala'i ibn Ruzzik, to confront Ibn Masal and his ally, Badr ibn Rafi. The two armies met in battle at Dalas in the province of Bahnasa on 19 February 1150, in which Ibn Masal was defeated and killed. Abbas brought his severed head back to Cairo as a token of victory.
Unsurprisingly, the relationship between caliph and vizier remained extremely hostile: according to Usama ibn Munqidh, the two despised each other, with the Caliph conspiring to kill Ibn al-Sallar, and the latter seeking to depose the Caliph. The mutual hatred of both men was only kept in check by the grave external threats faced by the empire from the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. Ibn al-Sallar entertained the notion of an alliance and joint action with the Zengid ruler of Aleppo, Nur al-Din, but this did not come to pass, as the latter was focused on capturing Damascus at the time. Nevertheless, following the sack of Farama by the Crusaders, in 1151/2 Ibn al-Sallar mobilized the Fatimid navy to raid Christian shipping along the coasts of the Levant from Jaffa to Tripoli, Lebanon. The fleet inflicted significant casualties and returned victorious. This success strengthened Ibn al-Sallar's position domestically, but was hollow, as neither the Fatimids nor Nur al-Din followed it up; in contrast, in early 1153 the Crusaders launched an attack on the Fatimid outpost of Ascalon.
The garrison of Ascalon comprised men of the local tribe of Kinaniyya, and a 400–600 strong cavalry force sent from Cairo every six months. In March 1153, Ibn al-Sallar prepared to send reinforcements to the city, both naval and military. While the fleet was being prepared under the personal supervision of Ibn al-Sallar, the army left Cairo for Bilbays. The force was led by his stepson Abbas and Usama ibn Mandiqh. According to the historian al-Maqrizi, this mission displeased Abbas, who would much rather have continued to spend his time savouring the pleasures of Cairo. His ambition inflamed by Usama, who suggested that he could become sultan of Egypt if only he so desired, Abbas decided to kill his stepfather. The plot was hatched with the agreement of the Caliph. Abbas sent his son Nasr, a favourite of the Caliph, back to in Cairo to stay with his grandmother in the palace of Ibn al-Sallar, ostensibly to spare him from the dangers of war. During the night Nasr entered the chamber of Ibn al-Sallar and murdered him in his sleep. He then sent a message by carrier pigeon to his father, who quickly returned to Cairo to claim the vizierate for himself, showing Ibn al-Sallar's severed head to the populace assembled before the Bab al-Dhahab gate. Abandoned to its fate, Ascalon fell to the Crusaders in August 1153.
Neither Abbas nor al-Zafir survived for long. Al-Zafir was killed by Nasr in April 1154 and replaced by his five-year old son, al-Fa'iz bi-Nasr Allah. When Abbas executed two of al-Zafir's brothers, the remaining Fatimid princes appealed to Tala'i ibn Ruzzik for aid. Abbas and Nasr were forced to flee to Syria, where Abbas was killed, while Nasr was captured by the Crusaders and handed back to the Fatimids for execution.
Legacy.
Historian Thierry Bianquis assesses Ibn al-Sallar as "a man of no discernible qualities whatsoever", whose greed led to "brutal and vindictive crimes", described in some detail by the chroniclers Ibn Zafir and Ibn Muyassar. These had made him widely unpopular, so that his murder was welcomed at the time.
As vizier, Ibn al-Sallar raised the pay of the army, restoring its order and discipline, and reactivated the Fatimid fleet, for the first time since 1125; unlike the army, the fleet showed itself to be an effective force during this period. Ibn al-Sallar was also active in promoting Sunni Islam in Egypt, against the Isma'ili doctrine espoused by the Fatimids: he ordered the construction of a Shafi'i madrasa in Alexandria, known as al-Adiliyya and completed in 1151/2, and may have been responsible for the appointment of the Shafi'i Abu'l-Ma'ali ibn Jumay al-Arsufi as chief "qāḍī" of Egypt. He was also responsible for commissioning a number of other buildings, including several mosques and madrasas.
His rise to power and downfall mark the beginning of the end for the Fatimid state: from al-Zafir on the caliphs were underage youths, sidelined and mere puppets at the hands of the strongmen who vied for the vizierate. This power struggle between generals and viziers dominated the last decades of the Fatimid state, until its takeover by Saladin in 1171.

Elizabeth (1786 ship)

Elizabeth was launched at Bermuda in 1786 or 1790. She first appeared in "Lloyd's Register" ("LR") in 1802. She then made four voyages as a slave ship, during the second of which a French privateer captured her. Next, she spent a little over a year as a hired armed tender under contract to the British Royal Navy. She returned to mercantile service trading with Madeira or Africa, until another French privateer captured her in early 1810.
Career.
"Elizabeth" entered "LR" in 1802 with C. Breer, master, Ingram &amp; Co., owner, and trade Liverpool–Africa.
Slave ship.
Slave voyage #1 (1802-1803): Captain Christopher Brew sailed from Liverpool on 10 June 1802, for Africa. "Elizabeth" arrived at Trinidad on 28 February 1803. She had embarked 250 slaves and she landed 225, for a loss rate of 10%. She left Trinidad on 5 April and arrived back at Liverpool on 30 May. She had left Liverpool with 24 crew members and she suffered 2 crew deaths on the voyage.
Slave voyage #2 (1803-1804): War with France had resumed while "Elizabeth" was on her first slave trading voyage. Before he set out on his second voyage, Brew acquired a letter of marque on 6 January 1804. He sailed from Liverpool for the Bight of Benin on 26 January. "Elizabeth" gathered her slaves at Lagos/Onim.
"Lloyd's List" reported on 14 September 1804 that the French privateer "Grande Decide" had captured "Elizabeth". By one report the French took "Elizabeth" into Guadeloupe. It is unknown how many slaves "Elizabeth" had embarked and how many she landed at Basse-Terre. She had left Liverpool with 31 crew members and had one crew death on her voyage. 
In July recaptured "Elizabeth", of Liverpool, that "Decidé" had captured while "Elizabeth" was sailing from the coast of Africa with a cargo of slaves.
Slave voyage #3 (1805-1806): "Elizabeth" returned to Liverpool and new ownership. On 2 August 1805 Captain James Brown acquired a letter of marque. "Elizabeth" sailed from Liverpool on 15 September 1805, bound for Africa. She arrived at Dominica on 10 March 1806. It is unknown how many slaves "Elizabeth" had embarked and how many she landed. She had left Liverpool with 32 crew members and suffered 12 crew deaths on her voyage. She also underwent some small repairs after she returned.
Slave voyage #4 (1806-1807): Captain Brown sailed from Liverpool on 17 July 1806, bound for the Bight of Biafra and the Gulf of Guinea islands. "Elizabeth" gathered slaves at New Calabar and arrived at Kingston, Jamaica, on 31 January 1807. She arrived with 313 slaves, but it is not clear how many she embarked, and how many she finally landed. She left Jamaica on 13 April and arrived back at Liverpool on 5 June. She had left Liverpool with 34 crew members and she suffered seven crew deaths on her voyage.
On 10 February 1807 the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed An Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, which prohibited the slave trade in the British Empire.
Hired armed tender.
"Elizabeth" needed a new trade. She next served under the Royal Navy under contract from 22 January 1808 to 27 April 1809 as a hired armed tender. 
Merchantman.
Entries in "Lloyd's Register" and the "Register of Shipping" are indicative, not definitive. They were only as accurate as owners choose to keep them. Some discrepancies between the two sources are also due to differences in publication dates.
Fate.
On 13 February 1810 "Lloyd's List" reported that the French privateer had captured "Elizabeth", Briant, master, as "Elizabeth" was sailing from Liverpool to Africa. "Lloyd's Register" for 1811 carried the notation "captured" under "Elizabeth"s name.

Tube (passenger information system)

Tube (stylized TUBE), formerly called the Passenger Assist Railway Display System (PARDS), is a passenger information system currently deployed on certain lines of the Manila Light Rail Transit (LRT) and Metro Rail Transit (MRT) systems. Developed by Filipino technology companies TrackMate Business Solutions and PHAR Philippines, the system was initially unveiled on May 5, 2017.
History.
PARDS was created amid complaints from train passengers that they are unaware of what's going on while riding the system, with a lack of information displays among one of their major complaints.
The system was unveiled on May 5, 2017, with the system being installed on one Line 2 train. By June 2017, all ten active train units were fitted with the system, with some 400 LCD monitors installed system-wide. Installed at no cost to the national government, PARDS is funded through advertising.
Although initially deployed on the Line 2, TrackMate also presented the system to the Light Rail Manila Corporation, the operator of Line 1, and to the Metro Rail Transit Corporation, operator of Line 3, eliciting a positive reaction. TrackMate also claimed that there is interest in deploying PARDS internationally, as well as that there is potential in deploying it as a suitable low-cost alternative to traditional railway signalling systems.
On March 28, 2019, an event was held announcing the system's rebranding to TUBE. In contrast to PARDS, TUBE features a redesigned interface and advertisements, and during the event, Filipino Youtube personalities presented how the companies aimed to deploy the system to all three lines. PHAR and TrackMate have announced that Line 3 trains will be equipped with the system by April 2019, with the goal of having the system deployed on all three lines by July.
Technology.
TUBE uses GPS technology to determine a train's speed, location and other important information, which helps determine a train's arrival and departure time. Information from the train is uploaded to the cloud, which is then transmitted back to the train.
Each TUBE-equipped train has been fitted with at least 40 LCD monitors which not only shows the train's location, but also news, public service announcements, passenger traffic and entertainment. The system is also capable of transmitting real-time information when circumstances require, such as in an emergency. 
TUBE also has a mobile component, where real-time train information can be accessed through a mobile application to be developed as part of the project's second phase, as well as a backend which allows the Light Rail Transit Authority to monitor train performance and passenger loads in real time.

Bárbara Virgínia

Bárbara Virgínia, born Maria do Carmo Miranda da Cunha (15 November 1923 – 7 March 2015), was a Portuguese actress, radio personality and film director. She changed her name in her teenage years. Bárbara studied dance, singing, piano and theater at the National Conservatory in Lisbon between 1940 and 1943. Theater was studied under Alves da Cunha, and piano was taught by Pedro de Freitas Branco. She later in 1946, became the first female Portuguese movie director, with the film "Três Dias Sem Deus".
Career.
Bárbara Virgínia was the first woman in Portugal to ever direct a feature film (there were some women before her who directed and produced films, but mainly documentaries or silent pictures). Her debut film was "Três Dias sem Deus" (Three Days without God, 1946) which she both directed and acted in. She was, at the time, only 22 years old – the youngest female director of that period. The film premiered in Lisbon on 30 August 1946 at the Teatro do Ginásio. The same year it was presented at the first Cannes Film Festival; Bárbara being the only solo female director whose work was presented. Today only 22 minutes remains of the original 102 minutes long film, these 22 minutes are fragmented and without sound.
She also directed the documentary Aldeia dos rapazes: Orfanto St. Isabel de Albarraque (Village of the Boys: Sta. Isabel de Albarraque Orphanage).
She directed these two pieces within a strongly male dominant sector and during the dictatorship of Salazar’s New State (Estado Novo) where women were expected to stay within reproductive work and not perform productive work. And it would take until after the regime fell before another woman, Margarida Cordeiro, would direct another featured film in Portugal. Still today the representation of female directors is low in Portugal, around 14% since the 80’s.
In 1952, she moved to Brazil, since she’s been rejected financial support for other film projects and a more oppressive control over the cinematic productions in Portugal. Bárbara has later stated that she has always been independent and that was the reason for the censorship to dismiss her. In Brazil she continued working within the culture sector as an actress in television, writing books and perform poetry recitations in the radio, but she never again directed or starred in another film.
Her name and accomplishment was for long lost in the Portuguese film history. But in the 2010s her contributions to the Portuguese cinematic heritage has been, somewhat, redeemed. Today there is a reward in her name.
In 2015, a reward was established in Portugal in her name, Prémio Bárbara Virgínia, to recognise female artists who stands out within arts. Also, in 2017, Luisa Sequeira’s documentary, "Quem é Bárbara Virgínia?" (Who is Bárbara Virgínia? 2017) had premier, which paints a portrait of Bárbara Virgínia and her cinematic history.
Personal life.
When Bárbara decided to move to São Paulo, Brazil in 1952, her mother accompanied her. She settled her and started a family – with husband and a daughter. She also opened a restaurant – Aqui, Portugal – where a vibrant social and artistic network used to hang around. Some of her famous guests were Edith Piaf, Tony de Matos and Amália Rodrigues. The last interview with Bárbara was in 2012 by Ana Catarina Pereira and William Pianco.

She then meets Peter Landell, who overhears Sophie talking to Serge about her worries for her son, claiming to be a university scientist, claims about files containing the answers to her questions. Sophie leaves Garret with Eddie, a man she met at Garret's school and sneaks into the university with Peter to find the files, using her mother's keys. After discovering that the files are missing, security guards find them and reveal that Peter is really a janitor.
Serge, who has been researching biotech chickens and GMO reactions on rats with fellow scientist Jacob, discovers the chickens to be dead and looks through Jacob's computer for any information. He finds information, exposing the dangers of the project, prints it, puts it into a box, and into the trunk of his car. He calls Sophie to tell her, but she is stressed after finding out that Eddie works as a cop for the GMO corporation, Clonestra, that owns half of Iowa. She refuses to speak with him and hangs up on him. Serge gets into his car and begins to drive to Sophie‘s house to show her the information. Serge is then pursued by two of Eddie’s friends who run him off an interstate, he crashes and is killed upon impact.
After hearing of the accident on the news, Sophie goes to see Serge's widow, who tells her that Serge's grandfather was a farmer in India who was growing GMO corn, with seeds given by Clonestra, which eventually led to the death of their crops which led his grandfather and other farmers to commit suicide in protest. Sophie then goes to a scrap-metal yard, where Serge's car was taken to once it was destroyed, and retrieves the information and takes it to Clonestra with Eddie's help, leading the CEO, Dan Conoway, to resign, after Kristin posts a YouTube video of Sophie explaining to Dan Conoway about the reasons to label genetically modified food. Some time later, Sophie, Garret, Kritsin, Eddie, and Eddie's son, Tommy, go to a football game. Sophie then sees numerous people eating food like hot dogs and popcorn and she begins to experience anxiety with her heart pounding rapidly.

Trikala railway station

Trikala railway station () is a railway station in Trikala, Thessaly, Greece. The station is served by regional trains between Palaiofarsalos and Kalambaka.
History.
The station open 16 June 1886 as an intermittent station of Thessaly Railways. The original station building (and the line) was designed by the Italian Evaristo de Chirico, (father of Giorgio de Chirico). The line was authorise by the Greek government under the law AMH’/22.6.1882. soon after the liberation of Central Greece from the Ottomans. Trikala was one of the mainline stations (as shown by the impressive original station building) along with Farsala and Kalambaka. In 1955 Thessaly Railways was absorbed into Hellenic State Railways (SEK).
Freight traffic declined sharply when the state-imposed monopoly of OSE for the transport of agricultural products and fertilisers ended in the early 1990s. Many small stations of the network with little passenger traffic were closed down, especially on the mainline section and between Karditsa and Kalampaka. In 2001 the section between Kalampaka and Palaiofarsalos was converted from 600 mm gauge to standard gauge and physically connected at Palaiofarsalos with the mainline from Athens to Thessaloniki. Since to upgrade, however, travel times improved and the unification of rail gauge allowed direct services, even InterCity services, to link Volos and Kalambaka with Athens and Thessaloniki.
Today the small Trikala Museum Showroom, located in a square opposite the Station showcases a small steam engine and two auxiliary wagons of the old Thessaly Network.
Facilities.
The station has a footbridge from platform 1 to platform 2, via stairs or lift.
Services.
Today, the station is served by direct lines to the rest of Greece, via Palaiofarsalos, served both by intercity trains to Athens, Larissa and Thessaloniki and Proastiakos to Athens. Previously Thessaly Railways operated a narrow gauge service to Volos.
In August 2009 TrainOSE S.A. proceeded to a drastic cutback of passenger services on Thessaly lines. As of Spring 2020 There are ten (five in each direction) Regional services on Palaiofarsalos-Kalambaka Line. In addition, there is one Regional train to Athens from Kalambaka and back (884/885).

Nissan Maru

Nissan Maru () was a Japanese cargo ship completed in 1939 owned by Nissan Kisen K.K. that was requestioned for service as an auxiliary collier and oiler by the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. She served with the 5th Fleet and was sunk by United States Army Air Forces bombers during the Japanese occupation of Kiska in the Aleutian Islands Campaign. 
Building and civilian service.
The vessel was laid down on 30 June 1938 by the Osaka Iron Works at its shipyard for Nissan Kisen K.K.. Launched on 6 November of that year and named "Nissan Maru", she was completed and registered at Tokyo on 15 January 1939. "Nissan Maru" was a 6,534 GRT cargo ship with a net tonnage of 3,887. She was equipped with a direction finder, and had two decks with a cruiser stern. She had a length of 424.1 feet, a beam of 57.4 feet, and a depth of 34.4 feet. The ship was powered by two oil-burning Hitachi steam turbines double reduction geared to one screw shaft rated at 500 NHP.
On 19 July 1939, while steaming down the Whangpoo River at Shanghai, she suffered a twisted bow after colliding with the SS "President Coolidge" while the latter was tied up at a pier. No injuries occurred on either ship.
Military service.
On 9 September 1941, as Japan prepared to enter World War II, "Nissan Maru" was requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy. She became an auxiliary collier and oiler attached to the Maizuru Naval District, homeported at Maizuru on 20 September. On the same day the auxiliary was assigned to the 5th Fleet, and Captain Sakuma Takao was appointed its supervisor. The vessel began conversion to military service on 24 September at the Osaka Iron Works shipyard; the conversion was finished on 15 October. On 25 November Sakuma was relieved by Captain Naotsuka Hachiro, and on the next day she departed Yokosuka. "Nissan Maru" spent the next months on duty around Hokkaido and the Kuriles, before arriving at Chichijima on 23 January 1942. On 28 January she returned to Yokosuka, before being assigned to supply the Aleutian Islands Campaign invasion force on 1 February.
On 7 March she was assigned to transport ammunition by the 5th Fleet, with an additional personnel transport mission being added on 17 March. In April she was fitted with fourteen Daihatsu-class landing craft, as well as a rangefinder and related equipment in May. On 5 May "Nissan Maru" was assigned to the operation for the seizure of Attu and Kiska; Naotsuka was relieved by Captain Ishii Saburo on 15 May. She arrived at Mutsu Bay in preparation for the invasion on 22 May, but was transferred to Kawauchi Bay on 26 May. She was briefly diverted to the Kuriles, and unloaded 200 tons of coal at Attu on 10 June. "Nissan Maru" arrived at Kiska on 12 June and unloaded her cargo.
At 08:30 on 15 June, still at Kiska, she was heavily damaged by several bomb hits during an airstrike of United States Army Air Forces Eleventh Air Force Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers, killing one crewman. She sank in Kiska Harbor at 07:00 on 19 June 1942 after being hit in a 05:00 air strike composed of three B-17s, four B-24s, and one Consolidated LB-30 from the Eleventh Air Force. The mission that sank her was the first combat mission of the 36th Bombardment Squadron, led by Major Russell A. Cone. The wreck of the "Nissan Maru" was identified and filmed by the National Park Service's Submerged Cultural Resources Unit after the program began in 1989.

Laurence Salzmann

Laurence Salzmann (born January 4, 1944) is an American photographer and filmmaker based in Philadelphia. His work, mostly documentary photography, focuses primarily on the lives of little known groups in America and abroad.
Life and work.
Salzmann was born January 4, 1944, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He describes himself as being "of that generation which thought that photography could bring about socially beneficial change." Educated in Philadelphia schools, he acquired photographic skills along the way, often from older photographers. Much of his career has involved using photography to preserve the history of groups of people in danger of being ignored and forgotten and encouraging his subjects to retrieve memories and tell their stories. Edward Sozanski, the late Philadelphia Inquirer art critic, wrote of Salzmann's work, "Cross a visual anthropologist with a talented photographer and you get Laurence Salzmann" and goes on to say that Salzmann's deep immersions in local cultures are "what give his photographs exceptional resonance and poignancy." (Phila. Inquirer, 2008)
Salzmann's first documentary project, "Family of Luis" (1965), came out of his assignment as a Peace Corps trainee in a "barrio humilde" of Ciudad Juarez. It attracted the notice of the Photography Curator at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Kneeland McNaulty, who bought several prints for their Museum Collection. The "Family of Luis" essay led to Salzmann's being hired as a participant observer and photographer by St. Luke's Hospital Department of Community Psychiatry for a joint project with Columbia University. Again, he lived among his subjects, this time in a Single Room Occupancy hotel, on New York's upper West Side. documenting the lives of its residents. His work, Neighbors on the Block, was published by the New York State Council on the Arts. A grant from the American Film Institute for documentary film making enabled him and filmmaker Peter Barton to complete two films about residents of the hotels. Salzmann took courses in Sociology at the New School of Social Research and earned a Master of Arts in Visual Anthropology from Temple University (1971). This training, in addition to his photographic experience, led to work with Tim Asch as editor for several of the films (Children's Magical Death, New Tribes Mission, Tug of War, Weeding the Garden) in Asch's "Yamomoto" film series (1971) and as an editor on Alan Lomax's Choreometrics project. A Fulbright grant enabled Salzmann to spend 1974 – 1976 in the small Romanian town of Radauti, documenting the lives of the remaining members of its Jewish community who had survived the Holocaust. Again, Salzmann learned the language of his subjects and lived among them. His pictures were published in the book: "The Last Jews of Radauti" with text by Ayşe Gürsan-Salzmann, (Doubleday, 1983). His film, "Song of Radauti" was broadcast nationwide by PBS. At the invitation of Cornell Capa, Director of the International Center of Photography, a large selection of the Radauti pictures was shown at the International Center of Photography.
A grant from International Research &amp; Exchanges Board allowed Salzmann to live for a year documenting the lives of Transhumant (migratory) shepherds in the Transylvania region of Romania. That work was published in book form under the title of "Miortiza" and shown in the Bucuresti Peasant Museum. At the invitation of the 500 Years Foundation Salzmann was invited to Turkey to produce a photographic essay on the Jews of that country. That project with a film took 5 years to complete and culminated in an exhibit, Anyos Munchos I Buenos that was shown in museums in Israel, the Netherlands, Germany, France, and the United States, plus two books, and a documentary film.
Most recently, Salzmann has worked in Cuba, Mexico, and Peru, documenting the lives and work of artists and athletes in Cuba, the way of life left behind by Mexican migrants to Philadelphia. A second Fulbright Grant to Peru has provided funding for Salzmann to document ways in which pre-Hispanic culture continue on the lives and culture of Quechua speaking communities of Cusco's Sacred Valley Writing of Salzmann's "La Lucha/The Struggle", a study of young athletes training in Castro's Cuba, Miles Orvell wrote “ Salzmann's photographs constitute an aesthetic and social document of great power...and are a tribute to his generous vision of cross-cultural understanding.” (The Photo Review, Vol. 28, No.3, pp 22–23, 2009) Summing up Salzmann's work, Jason Francisco, Associate Professor of Film and Media Studies at Emory College, has written “”The core intelligence of Salzmann's [work] is his non-didacticism, his unwillingness to forsake the suggestive for the merely explanatory ...”

Côte de Trieu

The Côte de Trieu "(in French)" or Knokteberg "(in Dutch)" is a hill in the municipality of Mont-de-l'Enclus, in the Belgian province of Hainaut. The road of the Côte de Trieu is on the south side of the Kluisberg, one of the hill formations in the Flemish Ardennes. The top of the hill, at 141 m above sea level, marks the border between Mont-de-l'Enclus and Kluisbergen, also the border between Wallonia and Flanders. 
The climb takes its French name after the hamlet of Trieu, at the southern foot of the hill. Trieu is part of the village of Russeignies, which, in turn, is part of the municipality of Mont-de-l'Enclus, in the north of the province of Hainaut. The climb starts with a gentle slope before gradually steepening to a maximum gradient of 13 % towards the top. With a length of 1,100 metres, it is one of the longer climbs of the region. The top of the hill is near the Flemish hamlet of "Knokt", from which the climb takes its Dutch name.
Cycling.
The Côte de Trieu is best known from cycling, as it is a regular climb in the Flemish races in spring and is sometimes included in the Tour of Flanders. Since 2018 it features three times in Dwars door Vlaanderen, where it acts as a strategic launchpad at 33 km from the finish. The top of the Côte de Trieu is also the top of Oude Kwaremont, which is on the northern side of the same hill.

EDNS Client Subnet

EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) is an option in the Extension Mechanisms for DNS that allows a recursive DNS resolver to specify the subnetwork for the host or client on whose behalf it is making a DNS query. This is generally intended to help speed up the delivery of data from content delivery networks, by allowing better use of DNS-based load balancing to select a service address near the client when the client computer is not necessarily near the recursive resolver. 
When an authoritative name server receives a DNS query, it takes advantage of ECS DNS extension to resolve the hostname to a CDN which is geolocationally near to the client IP's subnet, hence the client makes further requests to a nearby CDN, thereby reducing latency.

Maya Surduts

Maya Surduts (17 March 1937 – 13 April 2016) was a Latvian-born, French activist and women's rights supporter. She considered herself to be a permanent revolutionary and lived in various countries including South Africa, Switzerland, the United States and Cuba protesting regimes which discriminated against or exploited people.
Early life.
Merija Surduts was born on 17 March 1937 in Riga, Latvia into a Jewish communist family. Her father was a physicist and had left for Paris in 1936 after being arrested for his political activities, before her birth. Her mother was a psychologist, originally from Ponevezh, Lithuania, and immigrated in 1938 when Surduts was an infant with her mother and child. During the German occupation of Paris, the family fled to Nice and then lived in a town, Valdeblore on the border with Italy. When the Gestapo came to the border towns, they fled again to Montseveroux, but patrols in the area forced Surduts' parents to send her to live with a Catholic family. Between 1945 and 1946, Surduts was placed in a children's home run by the "Entraide française" (French Mutual Aid) in Bourgoin. She was later transferred to another "Entraide" home in Saint-Étienne and was finally reunited with her family in Paris. During this period, she only occasionally was able to attend school, but in addition to the Russian spoken in her home, she learned French and German.
In 1948, Surduts and her mother traveled on Nansen passports to South Africa to visit her maternal grandfather. They had planned to visit for six months, but stayed two years. Surduts enrolled in high school in Cape Town and she and her mother lived in a Jewish commune in Seapoint, where her mother became very active in the movement against Apartheid. Returning to France in 1950, the family lived in Arcueil and Surduts enrolled in the Lycée de Montgeron, but finished her high schooling at the Lycée Marie Curie, because her parents had moved to Bourg-la-Reine. During her high school years, the family's French citizenship was finally approved. She enrolled in the National Institute of Oriental Languages and Civilizations and became involved in the National Liberation Front to free Algeria from the colonial system. When she, and then her parents, were questioned about her political activities by the Direction Régionale de Police Judiciaire de Paris, Surduts fled to Geneva in 1960. Finishing school in Switzerland as an interpreter of English and Russian, in 1962, she received a scholarship to study in the United States and settled in Chicago. Participating in many events of the American civil rights movement, she attended the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963 and then left for Cuba by way of Mexico.
Career.
Arriving in Cuba, Surduts was referred to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and was employed as a French translator, while she studied Spanish. At the time, there was a thriving cultural and literary community of foreign nationals in Cuba, and Surduts became prominent in that circle. For eight years, she worked translating and teaching French for the Trade Ministry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, simultaneously engaging in various activist enterprises to reduce the reliance of Cuba on foreign aid from the USSR. She performed voluntary work in the cane fields, and planted citrus trees and coffee, joining the militia units. When it became evident that the economic policies of the government were not working, those who had criticized the regime were arrested. Surduts was held for three months and then deported in 1971, returning to France.
Surduts tried working as a freelance translator, but having been out of the country for so long, she had no network. She joined the radical left party, Revolution!, which would later become the Revolutionary Communist League. Activists working with factory workers referred her to the MLAC, where she got involved in reproductive rights. Participating in demonstrations and circulating petitions, she fought for the passage of the Veil Law in 1975. After the right to abortion was assured with the law becoming permanent in 1979, she turned her sights to reform on the laws concerning rape and incest and then in the 1980s, began pressing for changes in employment laws, to address pay inequality, job insecurity and women being forced into part-time work.
In 1990, Surduts founded and became president of the Coordination of Associations for the Right to Abortion and Contraception () in response to repeated attacks on abortion clinics and attempts to prevent women from obtaining the legal procedures in hospitals. CADAC pressed for and obtained passage of legislation in January 1993, of a law which made impeding the right to abortion a crime. In 1995, fearing that conservatives might gain in the presidential election and protections might be rolled back, CADAC organized a demonstration to rally support for women's right to equal pay, reproductive control and equality. Forty thousand protesters gathered and sparked a movement to stop roll backs in health and retirement benefits. After the rally, the National Collective for the Rights of Women, was formed and Surduts, one of the founders, became spokeswoman for the umbrella organization.
From the turn of the decade, Surduts continued to work to maintain women's right to reproductive decisions, but pressed for approval of laws to guarantee minors the right to contraception and abortion, which passed in 2001; legislation to protect women from domestic violence, which passed in 2010; protested proposed closings of public hospitals in 2013; and worked on reforms of the laws on prostitution, which were being considered by the legislature at the time of her death.
Death and legacy.
Surduts died on 13 April 2016 in Paris after a brief illness. Though mainly remembered for her fight to secure reproductive rights for women, she saw herself as a permanent revolutionary fighting for the human rights of those who were exploited or discriminated against because of systemic biases.

House at Breñas Point

The House at Breñas Point (; "House at the Point"), designed by Segundo Cardona FAIA, was built in 1978 with the original purpose of serving as a week-end home for a family of six: a couple and their four children, on a site shaped like a peninsula on Breñas Beach. This small house, built with modest materials, has endured the wrath of three major hurricanes and several tropical storms and has merged with the landscape while maintaining a distinctive presence within it. Since its construction it has become a landmark and point of reference for locals. It is also considered an architectural landmark for its modern interpretation of a minimal tropical dwelling in modest traditional Puerto Rican construction materials and methods: reinforced concrete and wood.
The house has been preserved by its owners in its original state. In 2006 it received the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Test of Time Award (Puerto Rico Chapter) for withstanding the test of time for more than twenty-five years since its construction. In 2014 it was included in the architectural guidebook: La Vereda Tropical: Down Where the Trade Winds Blow, published by Benjamin Vargas FAIA, as a record of all of the buildings that have been considered for the Test of Time Award by the AIA Puerto Rico Chapter from 1990 to 2009.
Concept and Structure.
The residence was accommodated along a visual axis that stars at the lot's entrance, stretches to its tip, and connects with one of the ends of a small bay shaped by the beach. Two volumes in concrete, laid out symmetrically in relation to a diagonal axis, contain the bedrooms and the kitchen. The central space, including a living room and a family room covered with a wooden sloping roof aligned with the main view, follows the direction underlined by the organizing axis. The design included built-in furniture that maximizes the enjoyment of views towards the ocean.
The whole structure was raised on columns to avoid disturbing the natural rocky topography. Some of the columns were elevated to form several porticos that frame different views of the sea and the beach. The total design effect is the creation with simple materials of a structure that does not pretend to blend with the landscape. Instead, it should be perceived as a constructed object posed on the landscape, with subtle references, in its architectural expression, to a ship.

Albatross (Nepali band)

Albatross (Nepali: आल्बाट्रोस) is a Nepali rock band from Kathmandu, Nepal. Formed in 1998 as a three-piece school band, Albatross has made a landmark in the Nepali music scene. It all began when a couple of guys joined hands together with their rusted guitars and other old instruments to transcend the sound of Nepali Alternative music, each of which has significantly influenced the music which the band creates. The band's fast tempos, signature chord progression and contemporary compositions has made them one of the pioneers of rock music in Nepal.
History.
In 1998 three young musicians, still in school, got together and picked up old rusty instruments and started playing. The trio experimented with Nepali rock sounds and western alternative music which led to the development of a sound of their own. Currently, Albatross is a four-part band and the quartet have made their presence in Nepal and internationally and continue to influence aspiring Nepali rock musicians.
Legacy and influence.
'Albatross also has the unique distinction of being the only band from Nepal to play at the South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin. Their successful tours in the US and other countries are a testament to their reception by the worldwide rock community'.
'Albatross in not only a legendary rock band from Nepal but has achieved worldwide success and notoriety'.
The band is largely influenced by Corrosion of Conformity, Alice in Chains, Radiohead, Pantera, Incubus, Megadeth, Tool, Stone Temple Pilots, Soundgarden, RATM, Porcupine Tree.
Live concerts.
Albatross has toured extensively in Nepal and have performed in packed venues around the world.

<doc id="56957582" url="?curid=56957582" title="Post-traumatic arthritis">
Post-traumatic arthritis

Post-traumatic arthritis (PTA) is a form of osteoarthritis following an injury to a joint.
Classification.
Post-traumatic arthritis is a form of osteoarthritis and the former can occur after the latter. However, post-traumatic arthritis can also occur after the development of chronic inflammatory arthritis.
Generally, post-traumatic arthritis is classified in two groups: post-traumatic osteoarthritis and post-traumatic inflammatory arthritis.
Post-traumatic osteoarthritis.
Post-traumatic osteoarthritis is the most common variation of post-traumatic arthritis. Between 20 and 50% of all osteoarthritis cases are preceded by post-traumatic arthritis. Patients having post-traumatic osteoarthritis are usually younger than osteoarthritis patients without any previous physical injuries.
Post-traumatic inflammatory arthritis.
Less common is post-traumatic inflammatory arthritis, accounting for between 2 and 25% of all post-traumatic arthritis cases.
There are reports about a connection between previous physical injury and inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis.
Signs and symptoms.
The symptoms of post-traumatic arthritis are similar to the ones occurring with osteoarthritis. General symptoms are stiffness, swelling, synovial effusion, pain, redness, tenderness, grinding, instability and intra-articular bleeding of the injured joint.
As a result of these symptoms, post-traumatic arthritis often comes along with the loss of ability.
Risk factors.
Since post-traumatic arthritis usually occurs after injuring a joint, the risk of having post-traumatic arthritis after such an injury is significant higher.
Risk factors which increase the danger of getting post-traumatic arthritis are being overweight and physical activity. The prevalence of post-traumatic arthritis is much higher when doing heavy work and overusing the injured joints. 
Examinations also revealed that a body mass index (BMI) increase of five units results in a 35% higher risk of post-traumatic arthritis.
It is reported that genetics do have an influence on the prevalence of post-traumatic arthritis. According to newer examinations, the sex of the patients may also have an influence on post-traumatic arthritis, since females are affected by post-traumatic arthritis more frequently than males.
Pathogenesis.
The process of post-traumatic arthritis can be divided into three phases: immediate, acute, and chronic.
Immediate phase.
This phase usually begins a few seconds after the injury; it is characterized by cell necrosis, collagen rupture, swelling of the cartilage, hemarthrosis, and the loss of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).
Acute phase.
In this phase, acute post-traumatic arthrosis emerges. Matrix degradation, leukocyte infiltration, inflammatory mediators, deficient lubricants, and apoptosis can occur. Typically, the acute phase comes hours after the injury.
Chronic phase.
The chronic phase occurs months or years after the trauma. Typical symptoms are joint pain and dysfunction.
Diagnosis.
Post-traumatic arthritis is diagnosed with the help of a patient's medical history. Additionally, radiographic imaging can assist in diagnosing post-traumatic arthritis.
Management.
It is not possible to cure the acute post-traumatic arthritis in order to prevent a chronic post-traumatic arthritis. There are many different options to manage chronic post-traumatic arthritis.
Lifestyle.
Since being overweight is a risk factor for post-traumatic arthritis, lifestyle changes that help manage body weight are important in the treatment and prevention of the condition. Lifestyle changes and weight loss often involve educating the affected person about how to practice a healthy lifestyle.
Therapeutic measures.
Physical therapy may help reduce pain and other symptoms of post-traumatic arthritis. The efficacy of massage therapy and manual therapy are not yet proven.
Medication.
Post-traumatic arthritis is treated symptomatically with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). For more moderate symptoms, paracetamol is also used.
Another medical treatment approach is the injection of cortisone or corticosteroid into the affected joint.
Surgery.
If medications, lifestyle changes, and physical therapy are not enough to reduce the symptoms, especially the pain, surgery and other such interventions for managing post-traumatic arthritis are available. In many cases, joint replacement or cartilage resurfacing are recommended. As clinical studies have demonstrated, such surgical methods can be effective at reducing symptomatic pain and the costs associated with management of the condition.
Epidemiology.
About 12% of all osteoarthritis cases in the United States are classified as post-traumatic osteoarthritis. This means that over 5.6 million people are affected by post-traumatic osteoarthritis only in the United States.
Females are more often affected than males.
Post-traumatic arthritis costs the US health care system approximately 3.06 billion (0.15%) of total health care costs each year.

Esther A. Hopkins

Esther Arvilla Harrison Hopkins (September 18, 1926 – May 19, 2021) was an American chemist and environmental attorney. Hopkins was best known for her career as a biophysicist and research chemist at American Cyanamid along with research in the Polaroid Corp Emulsion Coating and Analysis Laboratory. She also pursued a career working as an attorney with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) following her time as a chemist.
Early life and family.
Esther Arvilla Harrison was born on September 18, 1926, in Stamford, Connecticut, to Esther Small and George Burgess Harrison. Her mother migrated from Society Hill, South Carolina, to New Rochelle, New York, at the age of 12 (1901) to move north and work as a maid for a New Rochelle family. Small was the first member of her family fully freed from slavery. She was also the first member of her family to graduate from high school and to own a home. While working as a chauffeur in Stamford, Connecticut, she married George Burgess Harrison, who was also employed as a chauffeur. George was raised in East Orange, New Jersey where he attended high school, but dropped out to work as a janitor and chauffeur. Esther Harrison was born in 1926 and along with two brothers, one older and one younger. The Harrison family battled poverty, but Esther spent most of her time at the public library and the Stamford theater. Her parents also provided her with piano lessons even when facing financial adversity. Throughout middle and high school, Esther played the piano at her church and was president of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA).
Education.
Esther began kindergarten at the age of 3, passing an early enrollment test to enter school. She succeeded in the classroom, especially in the subjects of math and chemistry. She attended Hart Elementary School and Burdick Junior High School, both in her hometown of Stamford. Upon graduating 21st in her class from Stamford High School in 1943, Esther Harrison had her sights set on attending medical school and becoming a doctor. Despite being told to consider a career as a hairdresser, by a neighbor at the local YWCA, Esther had her mind set on medicine. After graduating from high school, Harrison had sights set on attending Yale University, although the school was not coed in 1943. She graduated from Boston University in 1947 with a B.A. in chemistry. She was rejected from Boston University's medical school due to the limited availability of two seats for African American students. Alternatively, she attended Howard University where she received her master's degree in organic chemistry in 1949. She later earned a second master's degree (1962) and Ph.D. (1967) in chemistry at Yale University, while carrying out chemical research for American Cyanamid. Her dissertation research focused on the effects of the release of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in fireflies.
Career.
After graduating from Howard University, Esther Hopkins began teaching chemistry at Virginia State College from 1949 to 1952 before deciding to pursue research. She was offered a position to work with the New England Institute for Medical Research in 1955, where she was an assistant researcher in biophysics until 1959. After this research stint, she worked as a chemist at the American Cyanamid's research lab back at home in Stamford. She earned both her second M.S. and Ph.D. in chemistry from Yale while working at American Cyanamid as a research chemist. Upon completion of her Ph.D. program, Hopkins was hired as a supervisory research chemist with the Polaroid Corporation in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1967. There she led the Emulsion Coating and Analysis Laboratory, checking the chemical composition of film coating uniformity.
Hopkins attended the National Science Foundation's Double Blind Symposium in 1975, which was a conference that focused on the challenges that minorities, the disabled, and women face and illuminate the underrepresentation in STEM fields. This combined with personal experiences as an African-American female, sparked her interest in law and patent work. While working for Polaroid, she attended Suffolk University Law School where she received her J.D. degree with a concentration in patent law in 1976. Hopkins left her Polaroid lab in 1989 and began working as the deputy general counsel at the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. She retired in 1999 from the Massachusetts DEP, but continued to work in her community, becoming the first African-American elected to the local Framingham Board of Selectmen.
Personal life.
Esther married John Mitchell in 1955, who was pursuing a doctorate at Boston University when they met. They had a daughter named Susan who died in early adulthood due to diabetes complications. The marriage ended a few years later. Esther moved back to Stamford in 1959, where she met and married Ewell Hopkins in 1959, a local minister and social worker.

Carla Dove

Carla J. Dove (born October 17, 1962) is an American researcher who specializes in identifying birds that have gotten trapped in airplane engines, known as "bird strikes". She is currently the Program Manager for Feather Identification Lab in the Division of Birds at the National Museum of Natural History. Her work helps promote wildlife safety, as well as pave the way for the development of preventative measures that will decrease the chance of wildlife impacting airplanes. She has published over 40 articles on her research so far.
Early life.
Carla J. Dove was born on October 17, 1962 in Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States. From an early age, she was involved in outdoor activities, in part because she grew up near George Washington National Forest. Her early hobbies lead her to become interested in wildlife, and later helped fuel her passion for birds.
Education and early career.
Dove graduated from Broadway High School in 1981. She was a first-generation college student, who went on to pursue multiple degrees within her field. In 1983, she earned an associate degree from the National Resources Program at Lord Fairfax Community College. Dove transferred to the University of Montana where she found her passion for birds. She earned a work-study grant in the zoological museum as a curatorial assistant where she learned to work in research collections and skin birds. In 1986, she earned a BS degree in wildlife biology. After earning her degree, she worked in a cancer research lab for a few years in Maryland before finding a job at the Natural History Museum.
Dove accepted a temporary position in the Division of Birds at the National Museum of Natural History as a museum technician in 1989. There she became an apprentice to Roxie Laybourne, assisting with her work on the identification of bird species from the microscopic characteristics of downy feathers. In addition to her position as a technician and her work with Roxie Laybourne, Dove enrolled in George Mason University in 1989 to pursue a master's program. In 1994 she earned her MS degree in biology. Her thesis was on the microscopic structure of feathers in North American plovers. Later that year, the U.S. Air Force accepted a research and training proposal that allowed Dove to focus on her research with a salaried position.
Dove later re-enrolled at George Mason University to continue her education, completing her PhD in environmental science and public policy for her dissertation on the microscopic characters of Charadriiformes (a type of shorebird) in 1998.
Research and publications.
Dove began working with birds during her temporary position at the National Museum of Natural History in the Division of Birds. From there she transitioned to her current position as program manager for the Feather Identification Lab. Using forensic methodologies, she is able to identify bird species from leftover fragments in the field of ornithology. These fragments range from the macroscopic level (feathers, beaks, color, size, pattern, feet) to microscopic fragments (blood, tissue samples). The lab is funded through agreements between the Federal Aviation Administration, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and the Smithsonian Institution.
Reporting and identifying wildlife strikes is of critical importance to promoting the safety of wildlife and the prevention of impacts with aeroplanes. This research has led to the creation of an Air Force database which forecasts bird movements as well as creating bird hazard warnings which are given to pilots. Engineers are able to design windshields and engines that are safer. Additionally, the data is used to manage habitats on airfields. This information is used in military and civil aviation to promote a safer environment for human and wildlife alike.
In addition to identifying the remains of birds that have impacted with aeroplanes, her skills have been used in a variety of other cases as well. Around 2013, her help was requested to identify what bird species were being eaten by giant Burmese pythons living in the Florida Everglades.
Her knowledge has led her to become an expert in her field internationally, and thus often collaborates with many scientists and organizations over the course of her career. She often works with researchers of ecology, anthropology and evolutionary biology. She has been a consultant to the US Air Force, US Navy, FBI, US Fish and Wildlife Service Law Enforcement Division, US Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Transportation Safety Board, FAA, in addition to various airplane engine manufacturers.

Anne Hiltner

Anne Hiltner (18 March 1941- 6 September 2010) was an American polymer scientist who founded the Center for Applied Polymer Research (CAPRI) and was later instrumental in the founding of the Center for Layer Polymeric Systems (CLiPS), a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center at Case Western Reserve University. She served as Director of the Center for Layered Polymeric Systems from its founding in 2006 until her death in 2010.
Education.
Hiltner received a Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry from Reed College in 1963 and went on to receive a Physical Doctorate in Physical Chemistry from Oregon State University in 1967.
Personal life.
In 1999, she married Eric Baer, who was the Chairman of the Department of Macromolecular Science at Case Western Reserve University at that time. She died on September 6, 2010 at age 69 after battling illness.
Career.
Case Western Reserve University.
After receiving her PhD in 1967, Hiltner began working as a research associate at Case Western Reserve University. During her first year as a research associate, she worked with chemistry professor Irvin M. Krieger. After her first year as a research associate, she worked in Eric Baer's laboratory. In 1971, Hiltner became a senior research associate in the Department of Macromolecular Science.
Hiltner made history in 1974 when she became an assistant professor of macromolecular engineering and the first female engineering faculty at Case Western Reserve. Later, in 1979, Hiltner was appointed an associate professor in the Macromolecular Science Department, a position she held until 1983.
In 1981, Hiltner founded the Center for Applied Polymer Research (CAPRI), which was an organization that encouraged collaboration in research across disciplines, particularly in applied polymer science, and was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).
Hiltner became a full professor of the Macromolecular Science Department in 1983.
In 1984, Hiltner was one of the authors of a proposal by the University of Akron and Case Western Reserve University to create an Advanced Technology Application Center in Polymers. This proposal was accepted and the Ohio Controlling Board approved a $4.1 million grant for the two universities. The universities decided to name their program the Edison Polymer Innovation Corporation (EPIC) after Hiltner suggested including the word "innovation," eventually leading to the acronym EPIC. The universities stated that the primary goal of EPIC was to "develop new materials and research technology that shows promise in rejuvenating the state's economy." Case Western Reserve coordinated its share of the work through CAPRI (which Hiltner was director of at the time) and researched polymer blends, polymer alloys, membranes, coatings, and lightweight composites. In its first few years, EPIC worked with corporations such as B.F. Goodrich, Firestone, and Goodyear. EPIC also patented a bandage to promote faster healing and helped form the Polymer Container Corporation in Akron, Ohio and NanoFilm in Valley View, Ohio.
Currently, EPIC is one of the world's largest associations for polymer research and provides a wide range of services to companies, including business assistance, research and development, and design and process improvement.
In 1997, CAPRI and the Biodegradable Polymer Research Center (BPRC) worked together on research on biodegradable micro layered polymer composite systems. Anne Hiltner was the principal investigator for this project and Eric Baer was the co-principal investigator. Hiltner and Baer generated micro- and nano- layered composite structures to study and characterize for degradation, while BPRC studied the degradation of kinetics from soil tests. The results from the research at BRPC helped guide the development of the composite structures being produced by CAPRI.
In 1998, CAPRI collaborated with the Center for Research of Macromolecules at the former Joseph Fourier University (now a part of the Université Grenoble Alpes). This U.S.-France collaboration focused on developing new composite materials with novel interactive electrical and mechanical properties, with Eric Baer as the principal investigator and Anne Hiltner as the co-principal investigator. Baer and Hiltner contributed their expertise in microlayering multiplying technology and materials processing and the French investigators contributed their experience with nano-scale technology to this project.
Hiltner was named the Herbert Henry Dow Professor of Science and Engineering at Case Western Reserve University in 2004.
In 2006, Hiltner secured funding from the NSF to found the multimillion-dollar Center for Layered Polymeric Systems (CLiPS) at Case Western Reserve University, which she would be the director of until her death. According to the NSF award, CLiPS aims to "create a broadly integrated program of research and education through the vehicle of a unique microlayering and nanolayering processing technology developed at Case Western Reserve University." Current partners of CLiPS include the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Southern Mississippi, Northwestern University, Kent State University, and the Naval Research Laboratory, all of whom are under the leadership of the current director, Eric Baer. There are also several other affiliate universities and high schools involved with CLiPS.
In addition to her polymer science work at Case Western Reserve, Hiltner also was a member of the Women's Center Executive Committee in 2001. This committee helped build the foundation for the Flora Stone Mather Center for Women by creating a position description for the full-time director of the Center and making a business plan for the Center's activities and identifying sources of supporting revenue.
Memberships and professional activities.
Hiltner was involved in several societies, including the American Chemical Society (ACS), the American Physical Society, the Society of Biomaterials, the Society of Plastic Engineers, and the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering. Hiltner was quite involved in the American Chemical Society, serving as an Alternate Councilor in 1978, being a member of the Executive Committee in the Division of Polymer Chemistry from 1979 until 1981, and being a PMSE Fellow in 2006. Hiltner was also highly involved in the American Physical Society, having been a fellow, part of the Publication Committee from 1977 until 1980 (she was Chairman in 1980), part of the Membership Committee from 1979 until 1981, and part of the Program Committee for the Division of High Polymer Physics in the early '80s. She was also on the Editorial Board for the Journal of Biomedical Materials Research.

Mabelle Kelso

Mabelle Kelso (October 10, 1883 – July 9, 1975), was an American who in 1912 became one of the earliest female maritime radiotelegraph (wireless) operators. She was also the first woman to be issued a radio operator's certificate by the United States government under the provisions of the Wireless Ship Act of 1910. Under her married name of Mabelle Kelso Shaw, she became a Doctor of Chiropractic beginning in 1924.
Early life.
Mabelle (also spelled "Mabel") Kelso was born on October 10, 1883, in Pennsylvania. She got her start as a stenographer for a Washington lumber company. In 1908, she began studying Morse code at Pittsburgh Technical College, and after graduation was hired by Western Union and the Postal Telegraph Company as a landline telegrapher. 
Career as wireless operator.
In early 1912, it was announced that R. H. Armstrong, manager of the Seattle office of the United Wireless Telegraph Company, had arranged for training two women, including Kelso, to became maritime radio operators. Studies included learning Continental telegraphic code, used for international shipping, and how to make minor repairs to the equipment. On June 6, 1912, Kelso was the first woman issued a "Certificate of Skill in Radiocommunication" under the provisions of the Wireless Ship Act of 1910, qualifying her to work as a maritime operator. Navy Lieutenant A. C. Call, who administered her examination at Bremerton Navy Yard in Seattle, was quoted as saying that she had passed with the highest mark of any applicant for a certificate who had ever appeared before him.
Kelso was hired by United Wireless, and effective July 1st assigned to the S.S. Mariposa, a steamship which traveled between ports at Seattle and in Alaska. Her appointment generated some opposition from members of Congress who wished to bar women from holding such positions on seagoing ships; however, she received support from the Pacific Coast Wireless Inspector of United Wireless, who stated that "he knew of no law which would bar Miss Kelso from her position".
In 1912 United Wireless went bankrupt, and its assets were taken over by the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America. R. H. Sawler, the new head of the Seattle office, soon discharged Kelso from shipboard duties, stating that "it was against the policy of the company to employ women operators". Other accounts of the dismissal claimed that this action was due to an objection by the federal government's Department of Commerce and Labor. However, the department quickly denied any involvement, stating that there was no prohibition or women serving as marine operators, with government regulations explicitly stating that "Women are eligible as applicants for licenses of any class or grade upon the same conditions as men."
Kelso was transferred to a shore station where she performed menial clerical duties, including keeping the books and transmitting from the shore station to the downtown office over a "buzzer" telegraph line. The passage of the Radio Act of 1912 meant that all previously issued operators certificates were voided, and operators now had to pass a standardized exam and qualify for a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd grade operating license. Kelso returned to the Bremerton Navy Yard and was issued a 1st grade license in February 1913.
Later career and life.
Kelso quit to pursue a higher paid stenographers job, and on March 28, 1917 married Lt. James E. Shaw. In May 1924 she was valedictorian of the seven graduates in the first class of the Golden State College of Chiropractic, and later received a naturopathic doctorate. As Dr. Mabelle Kelso Shaw she became a faculty member of the College of Chiropractic Physicians and Surgeons of Los Angeles.

Ghar Titli Ka Par

Ghar Titli Ka Par () is a 2017 Pakistani television series aired on Geo Entertainment on 18 December 2017. It is produced by Abdullah Kadwani and Asad Qureshi under 7th Sky Entertainment. The serial stars Sanam Chaudhry, Aiman Khan and Shahzad Shaikh in lead roles. 
The serial is about the betrayal disguised in friendship. It was popular throughout its run and gained high ratings.
Plot.
The story revolves around two college friends Shafaq (Aiman khan), who belongs to a noble and rich family, and Anji. Shafaq's family includes her father Atta, her mother Naheed and her brother Kamran. Kamran is engaged to his cousin Iram. Shafaq's family also has a close relationship with Naheed's sister (Shafaq and Kamran's aunt) and her son Hassan. Hassan likes Shafaq but is never able to tell anyone. 
Shafaq is kind-hearted and loved by everyone and quite rich, whereas, Anji is poor and greedy. Also, she takes pleasure by troubling others. She considers herself to be the prettiest woman on earth. She flirts with a waiter and constantly eats free food from his restaurant and takes a lot of money from him along with his jewelry. She flirts with a nearby grocery store owner and buys all the ration and luxury items for free. She constantly demands gifts and pizzas from a married neighbor. She befriends Shafaq just because of her money, because innocent Shafaq gifts her expensive things and also pays for her at the canteen always.
Anji soon understands that she can get easily rich if she marries Shafaq's brother, Kamran so she cleverly starts luring him and his family and flirting with him. Kamran is already engaged to his childhood fiancée, and cousin, Iram, who is very kind and loving and is very close to Shafaq also. But still, Kamran falls into Anji's trap but Shafaq's father gets to know of it and quickly calls Iram to their house and tells her the whole situation and asks her to be alert and handle the situation. Anji is also very smart and she makes Shafaq start to hate Iram and trouble her and throw her out of the house. Soon, due to Iram's efforts and wisdom, Kamran soon understands Anji's true colours but still they're not able to make Shafaq know about Anji's truth. Iram and Kamran marry.
Anji repeatedly provokes Shafaq to take her revenge on Iram, and then marries an orphan boy of a well-to-do family in Lahore. 
Two years later.
Aftab tries to be a good husband to Anji but Anji is always rude to him. She doesn't look after her two children, Bunto and Munni. Her Bua (maid) is taking care of the entire house. 
Shafaq also marries Azir and they shift to Lahore. The friends reunite in Lahore and seeing Azir richer and more handsome than her own husband, she gets so jealous of Shafaq that she tries to break her marriage. She tries hard to lure her husband and she is successful in doing so. Azir kicks Shafaq out of his own house in front of Anji. At the same time, Irum shows up and she takes Shafaq with her to Karachi.
After coming to Karachi Shafaq becomes pregnant with Azir's child. Irum tries to tell Azar the truth about Anji and also tells him about his upcoming baby. But he heard nothing and said he would only come to take his baby. Azar tells this to the good news, but Angie tells him that Shafaq is lying because if this were true then Shafaq would tell you herself.
One day when Anki and Azir go for dinner they happen to bump into the same waiter whom Anji used to flirt by telling her name as Shafaq. Waiter recognizes Anji and starts telling her cheating stories to Azir. Azir realises his wife is innocent and Anji is evil. He leaves Anji and Anji goes back to her mother's place. Azir pleads with Shafaq but she refuses to forgive him for cheating her and throwing her out of the house.

Fair Isle (horse)

Fair Isle (1927 – 1943) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. She was the top-rated juvenile filly in England in 1929 when she won three of her five races, namely the Champion Breeders' Foal Plate, Buckenham Post Produce Stakes and Bretby Stakes. In the following year she won the 1000 Guineas and Midsummer Stakes as well as finishing fourth in the Epsom Oaks and third in the Champion Stakes. All but one of Fair Isle's wins came at Newmarket Racecourse. As a broodmare, the best of her foals was the Queen Anne Stakes winner St Magnus.
Background.
Fair Isle was a small, "frail-looking" bay mare bred in England by her owner Lord Derby and trained during her racing career by Frank Butters at the Stanley House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk.
Both of Fair Isle's parents were also bred by Lord Derby. Her sire Phalaris was an outstanding sprinter who went on to become the most influential stallion of the 20th Century. His dam, Scapa Flow, also produced Fair Isle's full-brothers Fairway and Pharos.
Racing career.
1929: two-year-old season.
Before she raced in public Fair Isle attracted some attention and was reported to be highly regarded by her owner and trainer. On her racecourse debut at Royal Ascot in June the filly contested the Queen Mary Stakes and showed some promise in running fourth behind Qurrat-al-Ain. At Goodwood Racecourse a month later she appeared somewhat unlucky when beaten a short head by Ann Gudman in the Ham Produce Stakes. She recorded her first success in the £1,000 Champion Breeders' Foal Plate at Derby Racecourse, coming home five lengths clear of her rivals at odds of 2/5. At Newmarket in October Fair Isle took the Buckenham Post Produce Stakes and then won the Bretby Stakes from the favourite Fair Diana, leading her to be described as "the best filly" of the year in England.
In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the year's leading two-year-olds, Fair Isle was rated the best filly, four pounds behind the top colt Diolite.
1930: three-year-old season.
On 9 May, ridden by Tommy Weston, Fair Isle started the 7/4 favourite ahead of Qurrat-Al-Ain and seventeen other opponents for the 117th funning of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. Despite the unusually unpleasantly cold and windy conditions, the race attracted a large crowd which included the King. The favourite caused some concern by sweating profusely before the race, but started well and settled behind the leaders as Silver Mount set the early pace. Weston sent the filly into the lead a furlong out and a "tremendous struggle" ensued as first Qurrat-Al-Ain, then Sister Clover and finally Torchere launched strong challenges. Fair Isle displayed "doggedness" and "superb battling qualities" to prevail by a short head and a neck from Torchere and Sister Clover.
Following her win at Newmarket, Fair Isle was made favourite for the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. On her arrival at the course on the day before the race she became highly agitated and refused to eat her usual oats, having to be fed instead on a mixture of stout and eggs. She led the field approaching the final turn but failed to stay the distance and finished fourth behind Rose of England. In July she won the Midsummer Stakes over one mile at Newmarket, carrying 130 pounds to victory in what was described as the most impressive performance of the meeting. The filly was then dropped back to sprint distances and started favourite for the King George Stakes over five furlongs at Goodwood but ran unplaced behind the colt Stingo. On her final appearance, Fair Island finished third behind Rustom Pasha and Grace Dalrymple in a strongly contested edition of the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket in October.
Fair Isle earned a total of £9,423 in 1930, taking her career winnings to £13,219.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Fair Isle an "inferior" winner of the 1000 Guineas.
At the end of her racing career, she was described as "a fine miler at her home course of Newmarket, but a nervous filly,unable to be travelled".
Breeding record.
Fair Isle was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Lord Derby's stud. She produced at least three foals between 1933 and until her death in 1943:

5α-Dihydronorethandrolone

5α-Dihydronorethandrolone (5α-DHNED), also known as 17α-ethyl-4,5α-dihydro-19-nortestosterone or as 17α-ethyl-5α-estran-17β-ol-3-one, is an androgen/anabolic steroid and a metabolite of norethandrolone (as well as of the prodrug ethylestrenol) formed by 5α-reductase. Analogously to nandrolone and its 5α-reduced metabolite 5α-dihydronandrolone, 5α-DHNED shows reduced affinity for the androgen receptor relative to norethandrolone. Its affinity for the androgen receptor is specifically about 64% of that of norethandrolone.

Ahmed Abba

Ahmed Abba is a Cameroonian journalist, correspondent for the Hausa broadcast service operated by Radio France Internationale. He was questioned and detained for his reportage on Boko Haram and was incarcerated in Cameroon for 876 days. He was released in Yaoundé on December 22, 2017.
Career.
According to Radio France Internationale, the media outlet he worked for, Abba's reportage comprised issues surrounding refugee movement, political asylum and amnesty, assimilation, and society. His repertoire also included writing about Boko Haram's movement in West Africa, as well as their territory, strategies and beliefs, and most importantly, terrorist attacks.
Arrest and Trial.
Abba was arrested en route from a press briefing in the Cameroonian city of Maroua, after having met with a local governor there on July 30, 2015. He was taken to the nation's capital, detained, and refused an attorney until October 19, nearly three months after the arrest. One news report also notes that Abba's legal statement was not recorded until November 13. This is illegal, as per both the English Common Law and the French Civil Law, legal systems followed in regions of Cameroon.
Abba's trial began on February 29 of the following year, where the Court charged him of "non-denunciation of terrorism," "laundering of the proceeds of terrorist acts," and "apologizing for acts of terrorism." The military tribunal acquitted Abba from this last one. 
Due to an anti-terrorism law reintroduced in 2014, some organizations feared that Abba could face the death penalty. On April 6, the Militar Prosecutor requested the death penalty. However, he changed his request days later to life imprisonment. 
Nearly two months later, on April 24, he was sentenced to 10 years of incarceration and fined 55 million Central African francs, as per his lawyer, Clément Nakong. Abba appealed this sentence, according to his lawyer. After spending months in jail, Abba was summoned on August 17 to give his defense before the appeals court, which did not overturn his previous sentence.
Release.
On December 22, 2017, Abba was released from the Yaoundé prison in which he had been held for almost 29 months. His release was met with relief and pride by the journalists and press freedom advocates worldwide.
Awards and recognition.
On December 16, 2017, Abba was honored as an International Press Freedom Awardee by the Committee to Protect Journalists, at their annual convention in New York. His story and case were also spotlighted on the Committee to Protect Journalists' special report on violence against journalists in Cameroon.

Jeanette Grasselli Brown

Jeanette Grasselli Brown (born Jeanette Gecsy; August 4, 1928) is an American analytical chemist and spectroscopist who is known for her work with Standard Oil of Ohio (now BP America) as an industrial researcher in the field of spectroscopy.
Spectroscopy is a technique used to measure the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter. Her areas of expertise encompass fields such as vibrational spectroscopy, combined instrumental techniques, computerized spectroscopy, and environmental spectroscopy. She developed new techniques to solve problems like identifying contaminants in gasoline, analyzing the makeup of new plastics, and analyzing environmental problems such as pollution.
During her career, Grasselli Brown has striven to bridge the gap between research and practical applications between industry and academia. She is considered one of the foremost contributors to infrared and Raman spectrometry of the 20th century.
Early life.
Grasselli Brown was born in 1928 to Hungarian immigrant parents Nicholas and Vera Gecsy. She grew up in a Hungarian neighborhood in the Buckeye Road area in Cleveland, Ohio during the Great Depression. 
Her parents valued education and encouraged her to receive a college education in spite of economic and family difficulties. 
Around 1946, her father opened a business in Elyria, Ohio making sand cast aluminum parts. The foundry eventually failed and the family went bankrupt. Her brother Robert died from Hodgkin's lymphoma. While she was in college, her parents divorced.
Education.
Grasselli Brown attended Harvey Rice Elementary School, Alexander Hamilton Junior High and John Adams High School in Cleveland, Ohio. At John Adams, she was in a college track program and planned to major in English in college. However, when she took her first chemistry class, she fell in love with the subject. Her high school chemistry teacher told her if she majored in chemistry, he would be able to get her a scholarship to his alma mater, Ohio University, which he did.
Grasselli Brown graduated from John Adams High School in 1946, and attended Ohio University from 1946 to 1950. She worked in the chemistry department as an assistant and in the library. She was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. She was the only female chemist in her class and received her Bachelor of Science summa cum laude in 1950. In 1958, she received her Master of Science in Chemistry from Case Western Reserve University.
Grasselli Brown has received thirteen honorary degrees from various institutions including Ohio University (1978), Clarkson University (1986), Michigan Technology University (1989), Wilson College (1994), Case Western Reserve University (1995), Notre Dame College (1995), Kenyon College (1995), Mount Union College (1996), Cleveland State University (2000), Kent State University (2000), Ursuline College (2001), Youngstown State University (2003), and University Pecs, Hungary (2002).
Career.
Standard Oil (BP America).
After graduating from Ohio University in 1950, Grasselli Brown was offered a job position at Standard Oil (now BP America) in Cleveland as a project leader. From 1950-1978, she worked closely with an instrument called an infrared spectrometer. This device is used to measure the absorbance, emission, and reflection of infrared light interacting with a molecule and also measures the vibrations of atoms to identify functional groups.
During her time at Standard Oil, Grasselli Brown used the infrared spectrometer to examine the concentration of materials, and sought to find industrial applications for it. 
As a project leader, she analyzed the formulations of World War II German airplane fuels to understand how the German planes were able to extend their flight ranges. She also consulted with the coroner's office in Cleveland to analyze unknown samples at crime scenes.
In 1978, she became the manager of the analytical science laboratory, working there until 1983. In 1983, she became the director of the technological support department, working there until 1985 when she became the first female director of corporate research from 1985-1988. Grasselli Brown retired in January 1989 as the company's highest ranking female employee.
Post-retirement.
From 1989-1995, Grasselli Brown worked as a Distinguished Visiting Professor and Director of Research Enhancement at her alma mater, Ohio University. She has also served as a chair of the Board of Trustees, chair of the Ohio Board of Regents, a Foundation Board Trustee for nine years, and a member of the Cutler Scholars Board of Governors.
She has served on numerous committees and boards such as the National Science Foundation Advisory Committee for Analytic Chemistry (1982-1984), the Energy Research Advisory Board of the U.S. Department of Energy (1987-1989), the visiting committee of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (1988-1991), and the Smithsonian Institution's exhibition advisory board (1990-1994). She chaired the U.S. National Committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry from 1992-1995.
Grasselli Brown edited the international journal, "Vibrational Spectroscopy". She is a member of the American Chemical Society, Coblentz Society, Federation of Analytical Chemistry and Spectroscopy Societies, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She was the president of the Society for Applied Spectroscopy in 1970. She is active in promoting women's careers as a member of the International Women's Forum and National Research Council's Committee on Women in Science and Engineering. She is an avid supporter of women in the workplace and defends part-time work for women, equal salaries, and corporate child-care facilities.
Grasselli Brown has given over a hundred talks at scientific conferences, one hundred seminars for graduate students, and over five hundred lectures to the general public. She continues to be widely requested as a speaker and consultant on industrial and environmental problems. She travels to Eastern Europe to teach the use of spectroscopy for soil, air, and water pollution issues.
Civic involvement.
Grasselli Brown serves on the boards of numerous non-profit organizations such as the Cleveland Hungarian Development Panel, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Great Lakes Science Center, the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Breakthru, the Holden Arboretum, Martha Holden Jennings Foundation, Musical Arts Association of the Cleveland Orchestra, One Community, IdeaStream, the Cleveland Scholarship Programs, Inc., and the Northeastern Ohio Science and Engineering Fair.
Personal life.
Grasselli Brown has been married twice, to coworker Robert Grasselli (1957-1985) and to coworker Glenn Brown (1987-). Brown had two children from his previous marriage, Robyn and Eric; they now have three grandchildren. Jeanette continues to use the name Grasselli since it is the name she is known by professionally.
Legacy and honors.
Grasselli Brown has over ninety publications, nine books, and a patent in the field of infrared and Raman spectroscopy.
In 1985, she was selected as one of the Foremost Women of the 20th Century. She is the first woman to be inducted into the Hungarian and Austrian Chemical Societies. 
In 2002, Grasselli Brown received the National Ellis Medal of Honor and was selected as an International Scientist of the Year. 
In 1991, Grasselli Brown was the first woman to be inducted into the Ohio Science and Technology Hall of Fame. She was inducted into the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame in 1989 and is also a member of the Cleveland International Hall of Fame. 
In 2004, Grasselli Brown was chosen to be a part of the book "Ohio 200 years, 200 Women: Ohio's First and Finest."
As of 2013, Jeanette Grasselli Brown donated her papers to the Mahn Center for Archives and Special Collections at her alma mater, Ohio University.

1896 United States presidential election in North Carolina

The 1896 United States presidential election in North Carolina took place on November 3, 1896. All contemporary 45 states were part of the 1896 United States presidential election. North Carolina voters chose 11 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
North Carolina was won by the Democratic nominees, former U.S. Representative William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska and his running mate Arthur Sewall of Maine. 5 electors cast their Vice Presidential ballots for Thomas E. Watson, who was nominated as Bryan's running mate under the Populist Party banner in a form of fusion, at the same time as the Populists were engaging in fusion with the North Carolina Republicans at the state level (both fusion efforts being orchestrated by Marion Butler.)
As of the 2020 presidential election, this is the last occasion Northampton County has voted for a Republican presidential candidate, which stands as the second-longest Democratic streak in the nation. While Northampton County had been majority Black and a Republican bastion since the Civil War, the 1899 disenfranchisement of Black voters by North Carolina Democrats following their White Supremacy campaign of 1898 prevented Republicans from winning the county until long after political realignment had occurred.

Council of Ruisi-Urbnisi

Council of Ruisi-Urbnisi () was a synod convened at Ruisi and Urbnisi by the Georgian monarch David IV in 1103, that limited the church’s authority, expelled rebellious clergy, and expanded the royal administration into the clerical sphere.
Overview.
Throughout the 10th-11th centuries the Georgian Orthodox Church came into possession of vast land holdings, turning it into “state within a state” and clashing with the royal authority. In 1089, David IV became the King of Georgia and began to actively reform the country. In 1103 he convened the "Ruis-Urbnisi Church Council" at which he purged the clerical hierarchy of his opponents. The aim was the subjection of the church to state power, which was necessary for David given his plans of centralization and the reordering of church affairs.
He gave unprecedented power to his friend and advisor George of Chqondidi. The office of the powerful Archbishop of Chqondidi was merged with that of "Mtsignobartukhutsesi", chief adviser to the king on all state issues, and the new office of "Chqondidel-Mtsignobartukhutsesi" introduced direct royal authority into the church. The new chancellor also was given judicial powers and influence in both domestic and foreign affairs. For the following centuries, the Church would remain a crucial feudal institution, whose economical and political power would always be at least equal to that of the main noble families.
"Ruis-Urbnisi Council" adopted a special Code ("Dzeglistsera" lit. "pillar-writing"). It's believed that the author of the "Code" is Arsen Iqaltoeli, the translator of the "Great Nomocanon". It condemned Armenian Miaphysitism in stronger terms than ever before.

1896 United States presidential election in Michigan

The 1896 United States presidential election in Michigan took place on November 3, 1896. All contemporary 45 states were part of the 1896 United States presidential election. Voters chose 14 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
Background.
Ever since the formation of the Republican party, Michigan had been a Republican-leaning state due to the Lower Peninsula’s strong history of settlement by anti-slavery Yankees, who after the end of Reconstruction continued to see the need for solid Republican voting to oppose the solidly Democratic Confederate and Border States. During the Third Party System, heavily Catholic and immigrant-settled Southeast Michigan would lean towards the Democratic Party, which was opposed to the moralistic pietism of Yankee Republicans.
In the 1892 election, aided by favorable demographic changes and a legislative change allocating electors by congressional district, the Democratic Party managed to carry five of Michigan’s fourteen electoral votes, and also elect a Governor and a majority to the state legislature. However, the Panic of 1893 turned expectations or hopes of Michigan becoming a swing state rudely on its head, especially when incumbent President Cleveland stood firm, sending in troops to break the Pullman Strike. In the 1894 elections, only one Democrat maintained a seat in the state legislature, a loss of seventy seats compared to the 1890 elections.
In the wake of this decline, Cleveland decided not to run for a third term, and endorsed the National Democratic Party ticket of John M. Palmer. The Populist Party seized control of the Democratic Party and nominated former Nebraska Representative William Jennings Bryan.
Vote.
During his campaign, Bryan travelled through Michigan in the latter stages of his October Midwestern tour. Polls late in that month, covering all but three of Michigan’s counties, showed Republican candidate William McKinley ahead of Bryan by almost three-to-one, which was an increase upon his margin in earlier polls. Another poll a little later was also certain Michigan would vote for McKinley.
Michigan ultimately voted for McKinley by a margin of 10.29 points, a much smaller margin that earlier polls, although a reduction was expected as some unpolled rural areas of the state had been believed to favour Bryan’s free silver policy. His margin was an increase of five points upon what Benjamin Harrison had achieved over the state as a whole in 1892, though there were large variations. In the traditionally Democratic German Catholic areas, there was a large shift to McKinley due to Archbishop Ireland’s opposition to free silver, In the heavily Methodist cabinet counties of Michiana, by contrast, Bryan gained subtantially and was the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry Branch County, Calhoun County, Eaton County and Isabella County since Franklin Pierce in 1852.

2018 NA LCS season

The 2018 NA LCS season was the first year under partnership and sixth overall of the North American "League of Legends" Championship Series (NA LCS), a professional esports league for the MOBA PC game "League of Legends". It was divided into spring and summer splits, each consisting of a regular season and playoff stage. The top six teams from the regular season advanced to the playoff stage, with the top two teams receiving a bye to the semifinals.
Format.
Starting in 2018, the North American LCS began franchising. There are various reasons for this. First, it changed the overall structure of the league, encouraging long-term investments from owners. This allowed the league to implement revenue sharing, leading to a better foundation for both the teams and professional players. Lastly, the professional players were given a larger voice and more protection within the league.
The buy-in price for the league was $10 million for existing League of Legends teams, who had previously participated in the League Championship Series or Challenger Series. New teams would be subject to an additional $3 million (a total $13 million), which was distributed to the teams that were replaced in the league. Interested parties were given applications in June, due on July 28, 2017. Over 100 existing esports organizations, traditional sports teams, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs reportedly applied. Those applications were then narrowed down to a shortlist, nicknamed "phase two", which saw participants travel to Riot Games' Los Angeles office to interview and review their applications. Riot Games and the North American League Championship Series players' association also decided that league would not expand and instead remain at 10 teams.
Buyers for the league were decided in mid-October. Several existing teams from the league — including Cloud9, Counter Logic Gaming, Echo Fox, FlyQuest, Team Liquid and Team SoloMid — were reportedly accepted back into the league. Other existing teams, such as Immortals, Phoenix1, Team Dignitas and Team EnvyUs, were declined from entry into the restructured league. The team welcomed four new teams — one endemic esports team and three NBA franchises or affiliates. Longtime esports organization OpTic Gaming was reportedly awarded a spot in the league after receiving investment from Texas Rangers co-owner Neil Leibman. The other three new spots went to Golden State Warriors co-owner Joe Lacob and his son Kirk as the Golden Guardians, the Cleveland Cavaliers and affiliated venture capital firms as 100 Thieves, and the Houston Rockets as Clutch Gaming.

Area 1 Security, Inc. is an American cybersecurity company headquartered in Redwood City, California.
History.
The company was incorporated in 2013 by founders Oren Falkowitz, Blake Darché, and Phil Syme, all of whom were formerly employed by the U.S. National Security Agency. The company announced venture capital financing led by Kleiner Perkins and including Icon ventures, Allegis Capital, Cowboy Ventures, Data Collective, First Round Capital, RedSeal Networks CEO Ray Rothrock, and Shape Security CEO Derek Smith.
Area 1 was named a Cool Vendor by Gartner in 2016 and listed among "20 Rising Stars" of the Cloud 100 by "Forbes" magazine in 2017. Area 1 was recognized by the "San Francisco Business Times" as a "Best Place to Work" in 2017. In 2018, Area 1 was a Cybersecurity Excellence Awards finalist. In 2019, Area 1 was named Google Cloud Global Technology Partner of the Year Award for Security.
In December of 2018, Area 1 revealed a Chinese government cyber campaign targeting intergovernmental organizations, ministries of foreign affairs, ministries of finance, trade unions, and think tanks. Over 100 hundred organizations were identified in this campaign by Area 1 Security as targets of the Chinese government’s Strategic Support Force (SSF), which ultimately led to the breach of a diplomatic communications network of the European Union.
In 2019, to deter foreign interference in the 2020 United States elections, the Federal Election Commission ruled in AO 2019-12 that Area 1 "may offer its services to federal candidates and political committees at the same “low or no cost” tier that it offers to all qualified customers without making an impermissible in-kind contribution".
In January of 2020, Area 1 revealed a Russian government phishing campaign targeting Burisma Holdings and its subsidiaries.

Area 1 Horizon provides a cloud-based service to prevent phishing campaigns, whether by nation-state or commercial actors, and stop cyberattacks, including BEC scam, ransomware, malware, watering holes, malvertising, and other socially engineered threats.
Area 1 Horizon seeks and detects phishing attacks missed by spam filters and legacy devices. The company "maintains a network of sensors on web servers around the globe — many known to be used by state-sponsored hackers — which gives the firm a front-row seat to phishing attacks," the "New York Times" wrote in 2020. This approach contrasts with the strategy of training, educating, and relying on end users to recognize and report all such attacks.

Ordinaire (wine bar)

Ordinaire is a wine bar, wine shop, and bistro-style restaurant in Oakland, California. Located on Grand Avenue in the Grand Lake District, Ordinaire had its grand opening in September 2013. Ordinaire only sells natural wine, produced from organic grapes with minimal chemical and technological intervention. Owner Bradford Taylor opened Ordinaire while pursuing a Ph.D at the University of California, Berkeley with a dissertation on the sense of taste in early 20th century modernist literature. Taylor is also an organizer of an annual natural wine festival in Oakland called Brumaire, which has held events at Ordinaire.
In addition to selling and serving wine, Ordinaire serves small plates and periodically partners with chefs to open as a pop-up restaurant called Bistro Ordinaire. Food and wine critics have praised Ordinaire for its selection of wines and hip yet unpretentious atmosphere. Amid a wave of interest in natural wine in the United States, Ordinaire has helped to establish Oakland as a natural wine hub. The shop has been described as an important site for natural wine culture within the East Bay, the San Francisco Bay Area, the West Coast, and the United States as a whole.
Ordinaire and natural wine.
Ordinaire exclusively stocks and sells natural wine. Owner Bradford Taylor modeled Ordinaire after the "caves à manger"—small natural wine shops that serve food—he encountered while living in Paris, particularly Le Verre Volé, Le Chateaubriand, and Le Baratin. "Natural wine" does not have a precise formal or legal definition; however, the term is generally accepted to mean wine produced from organically farmed or biodynamic grapes, without the use (or at least, minimal use) of filtration or additives (except for preservative sulfites, which are still often avoided). Taylor has said "there's something productive about how nebulous the term 'natural' is, how it opens itself up to debate every time it comes up," and:
Ordinaire has helped to promote natural wine in the Bay Area and the United States generally, and has become an Oakland destination for tourists. Chaney Kwak of "The Guardian" cited Ordinaire in an article arguing that Oakland was becoming a "New Brooklyn" and a "creative capital to rival" San Francisco. According to Jordan Michelman at "Sprudge", there is "no one true home for natural wine in America ... But there are certain addresses that help define the culture here, and among them there's none more important on the west coast than that of Oakland's Ordinaire. ... [Taylor's] vision and influence at the helm of Ordinaire has helped define natural wine in America." Taylor has called the Bay Area natural wine scene "really nascent, in its early stages especially compared to New York or Paris," but has also said that Ordinaire's proximity to other natural wine bars has "made Oakland an organic- and natural-wine destination for people around the United States and overseas." Luke Tsai of the "East Bay Express" said Taylor was "doing God's work in helping dispense with the notion that wine shops are all stuffy, intimidating places frequented only by the rich."
History.
Taylor opened Ordinaire while he was a doctoral candidate at UC Berkeley, writing his dissertation on the sense of taste in modernist literature, or specifically, on "the concept of taste in early 20th century literature, as it toggles between an aesthetic sensibility and a more gustatory, more physical sense of eating." Taylor and his wife Nicole Betenia rented the building, a 3,000-sq ft former gym, and began renovations in October 2012. The shop was originally going to be named The Red Whale, but was renamed shortly before opening when Taylor received a cease-and-desist letter from a coffee business with the same name. The name Ordinaire was chosen after the French term "vin ordinaire", which refers to everyday, "ordinary" wines that skip bottling to be served by winemakers among their friends, typically in a bistro setting.
Ordinaire had a soft opening in August 2013 and its grand opening in September. The shop is located on Grand Avenue in the Grand Lake District, a neighborhood of Oakland located at the northwest corner of Lake Merritt. Taylor chose the location because it was less expensive than many of the city's other, better-established commercial districts; he also said he "thought it was ridiculous that this part of Oakland didn't have a shop that was an alternative to Trader Joe's and Whole Foods."
At the time Ordinaire opened, Taylor said that he and the staff "didn't know what the fuck we were doing" and that there was "a sum total of zero days of service experience between the entire staff." At the time of opening, Taylor said, most patrons were unfamiliar with natural wine, and so the store sold "a bunch of conventional stuff just to subsidize the kinds of wines we wanted to drink." By 2017, Ordinaire carried about 400 bottles in its cellar and, according to Taylor, had become "a producer-centered shop, so we try to buy as many cuvées as we can from each winemaker we support"—something wine writer Pamela S. Busch said shows "a certain level of support and loyalty on the buyer's part," but "also requires the consumer to actively participate and think about what they are drinking." As of 2017, Taylor was living in Chicago and working to open a new shop with tastings but no bar component, which "won't be called Ordinaire. There's only one of those." Taylor later announced that the Chicago shop will be called Diversey Wine. Since Taylor's departure to Chicago, Ordinaire has been managed by Quentin Jeanroy, with help from Alex Leopold, Kara Fowler, and Diego Perez.
Brumaire Natural Wine Festival.
Along with Josh Eubank (Percy Selections), Quinn Kimsey-White (Psychic Wines), and Matt Coelho (Woods Beer), Taylor helps organize the Brumaire Natural Wine Festival, an annual Oakland-based natural wine festival that began in 2016. Brumaire was inspired by wine-tasting salons and festivals in Europe and has featured wines from California, France, Italy, and Spain. Events at Brumaire have been hosted at Ordinaire itself, with other events hosted at nearby bars and restaurants. By its third year in 2018, Brumaire hosted 51 wineries and 500 attendants, with 400 people on a wait list.
Food and Bistro Ordinaire.
Ordinaire serves small sides for wine and food matching like cheese, charcuterie, and sardines. Ordinaire periodically opens as a pop-up restaurant called Bistro Ordinaire. The first Bistro Ordinaire pop-up opened in 2014 under the direction of Chris Kronner, who was in the process of moving his burger restaurant KronnerBurger from San Francisco to Oakland. Rather than his signature burger, Kronner served French cuisine and other fare. Kronner's Bistro Ordinaire won acclaim from Zagat, the "East Bay Express", and "Oakland" magazine, whose Ethan Fletcher said that Kronner "caused a minor riot among Oakland foodies." Bistro Ordinaire returned in 2017 with Kosuke Tada, a chef Taylor met in Paris, serving three-course, "prix fixe" French-style meals. Ordinaire partnered with the Oakland restaurant Camino for an annual lunch event called Piqnique Ordinaire.
For several years, Ordinaire partnered with the nearby pizzeria Boot &amp; Shoe Service to serve pizza at the bar. In January 2018, Ordinaire discontinued the partnership after Boot &amp; Shoe's owner, Charlie Hallowell, was accused of sexual harassment by 17 former employees. In an announcement on Facebook, Taylor wrote "[c]hange will only come if corporate officers and investors are economically threatened and the current modes of production are broken. ... Remember that the food and wine community that we cherish and enjoy is not built out of abstract ideas. It is built out of humans." Janelle Bitker of the "East Bay Express" noted the moral quandary facing restaurant patrons, who may fear that boycotting a business reported for sexual harassment could harm employees more than abusive owners; according to Bitker, Ordinaire had taken "a significant stand that boycotting — as customers, suppliers, and business partners — is the answer."
Reception.
Within a year of its grand opening, Ordinaire received positive reviews in "Eater San Francisco", "San Jose Mercury News", "SF Weekly", "Oakland Local", "Wine &amp; Spirits", "The San Francisco Examiner", and "Saveur". In December 2013, "Eater" named Ordinaire one of the 19 "hottest" wine bars to open in the United States (plus one in Montreal) in the preceding year. Ordinaire has been listed as one of the best wine bars in the United States by "Thrillist" (in 2014), "Bon Appétit" (in 2015), and "Food &amp; Wine" (in 2017). In 2018, "Esquire" named Ordinaire one of the 21 best bars in the United States.
Jordan Michelman wrote in the wine blog "Sprudge":
Local news site "Berkeleyside" recommended Ordinaire as a natural wine merchant, noting "[y]es, it has a young and hipster-y vibe, but there's zero snobbery," and called it "one of our country's greatest wine bars." Pamela S. Busch wrote for "The San Francisco Examiner" that Ordinaire was worth visiting from San Francisco: "I'd come back here even if it was a hole-in-the-wall — but it is not. Ordinaire is sophisticated without being pretentious, and this carries over to the ambiance. I wish it was closer to, if not in, San Francisco, but I get that Oakland needs to have wine bars of this caliber as well. No matter where you live in the Bay Area, Ordinaire is worth the trip." "Saveur" editor Chris Cohen praised the selection, atmosphere, and affordability, writing "I usually dislike drinking wine out—something about seeing a wine listed for triple what I would pay in a store rubs me the wrong way. Ordinaire does things much more civilly: they're also a retail operation, and for $10 corkage they'll open anything in the shop for on-premises consumption." Esther Mobley at the "San Francisco Chronicle" wrote that domestic and foreign natural wines were well-represented in Ordinaire's selection, but "[i]f it all sounds too crunchy-granola for you, there's also excellent normal-tasting wine here: Cabernet from Corison; Champagne from Bérèche et Fils and Laherte Freres champagne." Adding that Ordinaire had "great" wines at a variety of price points, Mobley continued: "In the spirit of La Verre Volé, Ordinaire is spare, unpolished, even a little disheveled: Open boxes lie along the walls; magazines are piled on the bench of a wooden piano. It's relaxing, like you're in someone's living room. Pours are not stingy, and unsolicited top-offs are not uncommon."
Marissa A. Ross, the wine columnist for "Bon Appétit", is an avowed fan of Ordinaire. In her 2017 book "Wine. All the Time.: The Casual Guide to Confident Drinking", Ross wrote "I trust my favorite wine shops so much you would assume I was of blood relation to their owners. Places like Domaine LA, Lou, or Ordinaire know me better than I know myself." In an article on natural wine for "Bon Appétit" co-written by Ross and Belle Cushing, the two opined: "A natural wine bar—whether it's Ordinaire in Oakland or Sub Rosato in Richmond, VA—is a modern version of "Cheers", with hand-harvested pinots instead of pints. And even if no one knows your name (yet), you might recognize some labels on the wall—a sign that you're among friends."

Farm Structure Survey

The Farm Structure Surveys (), also known as the Survey on the Structure of Agricultural Holdings, are the methodological basis for censuses of agricultural operations throughout the European Union. The survey itself is used as the basis of an decennial European Union-wide census of agriculture as well as for sample surveys conducted between these years.
Overview.
At present, the Farm Structure Surveys are legislated through Regulation 1166/2008 of the European Parliament. Regulation 1166/2008 legislates both the decennial census of agriculture as well as follow-up surveys in 2013 and 2016.
The focus on these standards is to provide “comparable data on agricultural activities, at the appropriate geographical level, and covering the whole Community” for the purposes of informing the Common Agricultural Policy within the European Union and agricultural policy within individual states.
The census of agriculture is not operated concurrently to censuses of population throughout the European Union.
Methodology.
While the individual methodology of the Farm Structure Survey varies country to country, the focus is on observing each individual “agricultural holding” and their characteristics, including land, livestock, and labour force characteristics as well as rural development measures.
This agricultural holding, “a technical-economic unit, under single management, engaged in agricultural production” is the base unit of observation in the Farm Structure Surveys. Before 2007 this was defined as one hectare of “utilized agricultural area,” but since has become flexible, allowing individual countries to exclude only the smallest agricultural holdings which contribute 2% or less to total Utilized agricultural area or farm livestock units. Beyond this, specific physical thresholds are also given for inclusion:
As the thresholds have changed varyingly from country to country, this complicates the direct comparability of findings between years and between countries, alongside to the varying agricultural identities and cultures which exist within the European Union.
Like other censuses of agriculture, the information observed through the Farm Structure Surveys are protected by confidentiality in both limiting local parameters and aggregation of the reported data.
Standard gross margin.
Standard gross margins or SGMs enable the classification of farms according to the type of enterprises on the farm and their relative contribution to overall profitability. The SGM provides a measure of a holding's business size, irrespective of its area and intensity of production. SGMs are calculated per unit area of crops and head of livestock, using standardized SGM coefficients for each type of crop and livestock. Different SGM coefficients are calculated for different geographical regions to allow for differences in profit. SGMs are representative of the level of profit that could be expected on the average farm under "normal" conditions (i.e. no disease outbreaks or adverse weather).
Eurostat uses SGMs for collating European Union farm statistics. In the UK, the UK government's June census for agriculture also applies this classification. As the system of classifying business size was developed for use within the EU statistical network, SGMs are measured in euros and presented in size ranges, which relate to European size units (ESU). The resulting figures per hectare of crop and per head of livestock are then totaled for the whole farm. Sizes of holdings are defined, for example, in the UK, as:
Publication.
Like other agricultural surveys, the results of the Farm Structure Surveys are published for public use. As they are the aggregate of data collection by individual nations statistics agencies, the timeline for data to be shared with the European Commission is twelve to eighteen months after the survey year. This means that the data is shared later than other censuses of agriculture.
The most recent European Union Census of Agriculture data can be found in the 2013 Agriculture, forestry and fishery statistics produced by Eurostat.

Karoo Ashevak

Karoo Ashevak (Inuktitut: ᑲᕈ ᐊᓴᕙ) (1940 – October 19, 1974) was an Inuk sculptor who lived a nomadic hunting life in the Kitikmeot Region of the central Arctic before moving into Spence Bay, Northwest Territories (now Taloyoak, Nunavut) in 1960. His career as an artist started in 1968 by participating in a government-funded carving program. Working with the primary medium of fossilized whale bone, Ashevak created approximately 250 sculptures in his lifetime, and explored themes of shamanism and Inuit spirituality through playful depictions of human figures, "angakuit" (shamans), spirits, and Arctic wildlife.
In 1970, the Canadian Eskimo Art Council held the Centennial competition in Yellowknife. Ashevak's sculptures won third prize in that competition, and he became a recognizable artist after his solo exhibition at the American Indian Art Centre in New York in 1973. Unlike other Inuit primitivist carvings, Ashevak's work abandoned cultural references and adopted a modern expressionistic style, which visually appealed to a broader audience than collectors of Inuit art.
An extensive collection of Ashevak's sculptures went on solo or group exhibitions at commercial galleries around the world, including Franz Bader Gallery at Washington, D.C., Lippel Gallery in Montreal, the Upstairs Gallery in Winnipeg and the Inuit Gallery in Toronto. Ashevak's works were also widely traded on the auction market. Despite his short and tragic passing — he died in October 1974 from a house fire, Ashevak was crucial to the development of Inuit sculpture by visualizing an imaginative world with supernatural beings and shamanistic practices.
Early life.
Ashevak was born in 1940 in the Kitikmeot Region, of the central Arctic of Nunavut. Like many Netsilik youths, he lived a traditional Inuit life by acquiring hunting skills that were necessary to support himself in later life. However, Ashevak grew up at a time when the establishment of wage-earning settlements rapidly replaced the Eskimo lifestyle and economy. In the past, Netsilik people lived in small communities and worked as nomadic hunters. Since they moved off the land to Spence Bay (Taloyoak), they were forced to adopt a southern-style economy such as living in a house and having a stable job. Ashevak and his wife Doris moved into the settlement in 1968. During that time, Abjon Bromfield, the Arts and Crafts officer at Fort Smith, Northwest Territories received a shipment of two carvings from Spence Bay. These Inuit carvings were highly appreciated in Ottawa and inspired people's interest in purchasing more sculptures from the region. Therefore, a carving program was funded by the government in Spence Bay, and sculptor Algie Malauskas was hired to teach Inuit people some fundamental sculpture techniques. Ashevak soon joined the program because he could no longer support his family by hunting, and carving was one of the well-paid alternatives to earn a livelihood. Ashevak's official entrance into the art world was in 1970, where he participated in the Centennial competition in Yellowknife, held by the Canadian Eskimo Art Council. Ashevak's sculptures, "Bird" and "Drum Dancer" won third prize and an honourable mention respectively. In 1972, Avrom Isaacs collected Ashevak's works to organize a solo exhibition at the Inuit Gallery in Toronto. The show was financially successful in which about 30 pieces of Ashevak's sculptures became trendy among the public and sold well. However, this exhibition did not make Ashevak famous. His reputation was firmly established after the exhibition at the American Indian Art Centre in New York in 1973.
Career.
In 1968, Karoo Ashevak settled in Taloyoak where his career began through an arts and crafts program sponsored by the government. His style evolved into the well-known "expressionistic style" in the Kitikmeot area in the early 1970s. His works are inspired by stories told to him in his childhood by his father. Many of his sculptures have wide noses, gaping mouths, and uneven eyes. His art is admired for this originality and abnormal appearance. While some people praised his work, others considered it too grotesque. The majority of his artistic production occurred from 1971 to 1974. During this time, he was unknown in the art market, nonetheless, he held several exhibitions where his work appealed to the majority and sold in mass amounts. He was first noticed in Yellowknife when he entered the Centennial competition in 1970 organized by the Canadian Eskimo Art Council. It was not until his late artistic career that he gained recognition. He is now acknowledged as an important artist in Canadian Inuit art. He was not exclusively recognized until spring of 1972 when Avrom Isaacs used Karoo's sculptures in a one-man exhibition at the Inuit Gallery in Toronto. Despite its success, it did not make him famous he was mainly known to those associated with Eskimo art. Finally, in January 1973, his exhibition at the American Indian Art Centre in New York established his local fame and overall reputation in the eastern U.S. and Canada. This marked the height of his career, just a year prior to his death.
Media.
In the 1970s, Ashevak favoured and used predominantly aged whale bones as his medium. During his artistic years, whale bones would be imported to the community through charter planes from Somerset Island because this material was sparse while demands were higher than the inventory. They were not readily available in Spence Bay and many other carvers were seeking it for their artistic production. Historically, bones were used in Taloyoak to make tools and weapons. It was not until the settlement began its carving production that bone was used as the main medium, with whale bone being the material used for the first carving produced.
Both the prehistoric Thule people and the later colonialist European whalers left mass amounts of whale bone. These aged bones experienced inconsistent and prolonged exposure from Arctic conditions. This altered their qualities and features, such as their density and colour. Whale bones needed to be aged for approximately 50 to 100 years before it is qualified for carving. If the material is partially aged or dried, it may smell or shrink while working with the material.
Whale bone is an inconsistent medium that varies in colour from a white to a cream, to brown, and to nearly black. Moreover, they have a range from very dense to extremely fragile bone consistency. Bones may also transform from one density to another, which makes the material difficult to work with. For example, sometimes bone can become extremely hard to the point that it is nearly impossible to carve. Additionally, they may crack or split before, during, and after carving. Cracks that occur during the production process can be integrated into the final piece, however, splits that appear after carving often destroy the piece.
His medium choice could be a result of the insufficient amount of materials for sculpting in the community or a liking for light materials rather than media such as stones or ivory. Even though Ashevak used fossilized whale bone as his primary medium, he would incorporate local materials, such as stone, caribou antler and baleen, and walrus ivory, as additional supplements.
Ashevak first chooses his idea for his sculpture before he selects the medium or media that he would use. He took advantage of the preexisting shapes of the material and manipulates the bone in order to illustrate his ideas and the work's theme. Also, he tended to reassembled and fashioned different pieces taken from different parts of the whale to conform to his design concept, rather than carving from a solid piece of bone. For example, he inserts whale baleen as the eyes and mouths.
Ashevak and the art market.
According to Leon Lippel, Ashevak's sculptures evoked an overwhelmingly affirmative response at his own time. Between 1972 and 1974, the artist had several successful exhibitions, and his works sold very well on the art market. Ashevak's sculptures were universal in message and appeal, which was strikingly different from most Inuit art. Max Wheitzenhoffer from the Gimpel-Wheitzenhoffer gallery stated that he "never looked at Ashevak’s pieces as Eskimo art."
Inuit sculptures followed a narrative tradition by depicting legends, events or social activities that were well known among Inuit communities. In contrast, Ashevak's sculptures abandoned this illustrative tradition. Each of his pieces portrays an individual being with no cultural references to particular myths, stories or events. Therefore, Ashevak's work could speak to the audience who did not have any knowledge of the Inuit culture and attract the audience based on its purely aesthetic values. There were two distinctive characteristics of Ashevak's early exhibitions. First, his sculptures were strongly appealing to non-Inuit art collectors, including those who did not regularly collect. Second, people were astonished by Ashevak's work and reacted immediately with tremendous enthusiasm. Ashevak became a recognizable figure in Canada and the United States shortly after his exhibitions at the Inuit Gallery of Toronto (1972) and the American Indian Arts Centre in New York (1973). It normally took a while for the audience to embrace a new artistic style, but they fell in love with Ashevak's work at once.
Works and shamanism.
Ashevak's sculptures present a fantasy of spirits and supernatural beings bursting with powerful emotions. His figures embody wide eyes, gaping mouths, distorted body features and incised lines, which are directly related to Inuit religion (shamanism). "Angakuit" (shamans) are people with special powers that enable them to act as a mediator between the temporal world and the spiritual world. Shamanism is based on the animistic belief that a spirit could exist in every being and take different forms. Some spirits are friendly to human beings, and they function as helping spirits to assist angakuit performing supernatural tasks. In contrast to the helping spirits, evil spirits attack or eat humans, and they would bring misfortune and disasters to the community. Angakuit could protect people from evil spirits by acquiring helping spirits that are frequently seen in polar bears, birds and walrus. Ashevak portrayed various helping spirits in animal forms such as "Bear" (1973), "Flying Walrus" (1972), and a mystical four-legged creature with wings.
Another favourite subject of Ashevak's sculptures are birds. Some of them have prey in their mouths, while others embody unusual features such as human arms (1972), or experience a human-bird transformation. Birds are associated with the "angakkuq" magical flights. In the Netsilik tradition, "angakuit" could be transformed into birds, and travel to all regions in the cosmos. During their magical journeys, "angakuit" fly into the sky, the land of the dead, and even to the homes of ancient Inuit deities. Ashevak depicted these shamanistic flights through his sculptures of "Flying Figure" (1971) and "Shaman" (1973), where the "angakuit"s’ bodies are represented in a flying position.
Ashevak untitled most of his works, but one of the very few sculptures which had a title was directly related to shamanism. In the Inuit culture, one needs to take an apprenticeship to become a "angakkuq". The "angakkuq" candidate needs to receive formal training from an elder, which helps him gain skills and powers that are necessary to fulfil his future position. By the end of the practice, an elder "angakkuq" would transmit his power to the young "angakkuq" by placing his hands on the young shaman's head. Ashevak's work, "Coming and Going of the Shaman" (1973) represents the transformation of powers between two "angakuit". This sculpture has two heads of different sizes that share one body. The "angakkuq" with the larger head is disappearing as he passes his powers to the "angakkuq" with the smaller head.
Ashevak's choices of subjects also came from dreams, childhood stories and hunting scenes. Dream was a crucial element of Inuit culture, especially in the Netsilik community. Ashevak's sculpture, "Drum Dancer" was inspired by his dream of a man with three arms. Other visual elements in Ashevak's creations included varying sizes and shapes of eyes. According to the shamanistic belief, certain spirits acted as the "angakkuq" eyes, and they could fly over long distance and report to the "angakkuq" what they had seen. Moreover, Ashevak's use of incised lines was related to the Thule culture. In his sculptures, Bird of 1970 and 1971, incised lines are used to depict the skeleton of the birds, which is a typical characteristic of shamanism.
Personal life.
Ashevak was known for having a distinctive personality among the Inuit artists by being openly expressive about his emotions. It was uncommon for Inuit adults to display their feelings because they highly valued the idea of "Ihuma", which was the ability of emotional restraint. "Ihuma" was a significant indigenous personality, and the grown-ups exercised "Ihuma" by hiding their joy or anger in front of the public. However, Ashevak freely vented his emotions, and sometimes he even displayed aggressive and antagonistic behaviours.
Ashevak enjoyed the creative process of carvings, and he took enormous pride in his work. Although the artist was aware of the market value of his sculptures, he priced them accurately by himself. Carving was the primary resource of Ashevak's income, but money was not the only factor to inspire his continuous creations. Ashevak's favourite part of sculpture was to apply finishing touches, which gave the final piece distinctive details. Ashevak respected the originality of carvings, and he became irritated when other sculptors copied his works since he did not know how to deal with the imitators.
In August 1974, Ashevak's life started to come to a tragic end. His adopted son, Lary, was killed by dogs. On October 19 of the same year, Ashevak and his wife Doris both died in a fire that destroyed their house.
Achievements.
Ashevak established a well-known reputation in his community and the nearby area of Uqsuqtuc, otherwise recognized as Gjoa Haven, during his artistic career. His work inspired a whole generation of Kitikmeot carvers. Although he only created about 250 sculptures during his short artistic career, his works have been included in multiple exhibitions and continue to be widely collected as well as traded on the art market and during auctions. They are also included in many corporate and museum collections. He executed solo exhibitions in Toronto, Montreal, and New York. When he was first officially noticed in 1970 during the Centennial competition in Yellowknife, he won third prize and honourable mention for his entries of Bird and Drum Dancer, respectively. This was the beginning of his successful career. Ashevak's early exhibitions between 1972 and 1974 had very successful outcomes as many works were sought after and sold even though he was not well-known yet. Two features that make these exhibitions stand out is the type of purchaser and the audience reaction. The sculptures were popular amongst Eskimo and non-Eskimo art collectors as well as people who normally do not collect Eskimo art. The audience were also immediately captivated by his work, especially in exhibitions at the Inuit Gallery in Toronto and the American Indian Arts Centre in New York.
Theatrical producer, Max Weitzenhoffer, ranked Ashevak as one of the top contemporary Canadian sculptors because he viewed Askevak's work apart and unique from the other Inuit artists’ production. He believes that they are universally accepted and appeal to a mass majority. Scholar, George Swinton, compared him to Henry Moore who is a well-known English artist famous for his sculptures.
