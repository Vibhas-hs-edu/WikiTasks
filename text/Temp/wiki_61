Spivy

Bertha Levine (September 30, 1906 – January 7, 1971), who used the stage name Spivy ( ), was an American entertainer, nightclub owner, and actress.
Biography.
Early life.
Bertha Levine was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1906, the eldest of the four daughters of Louis and Helen Levine, Jewish immigrants from Russia. She played organ in churches and theaters before establishing a career as a singer-pianist in speakeasies and nightclubs under the name Spivy Le Voe, which she later shortened to Spivy. Her stage name was reportedly based on a younger sister's mispronunciation of the word "sister."
Performing career.
In 1936 she became a regular act at Tony's, a New York nightclub on West 52nd Street, where she performed satirical songs, some of which were written by John Latouche and Jill Rainsford. In 1939, the "New York Times" wrote that "Spivy's material, witty, acid, and tragicomic, is better than most of the essays one hears about town, and her delivery is that of a sophisticated artist on her own grounds. She knows the value of surprise in punching a line, she uses understatement unerringly, and her piano accompaniment is superb."
From 1940–1951 she ran her own nightclub, Spivy's Roof, on New York's East 57th Street. The club was noted for its tolerance of gay performers and patrons; Spivy herself was a lesbian in private life. Among the artists who performed there were Frances Faye, Mabel Mercer, Moms Mabley, Thelma Carpenter, Paul Lynde, Martha Raye, Bea Arthur, Liberace, and actor-magician Fred Keating.
Although it was reported that Spivy and Keating intended to marry on Christmas Eve 1942, this appears to have been a publicity stunt or lavender marriage.
She released two 78 rpm albums of songs, which have never been reissued on CD. Her recordings indicate that her performing style was to "recite" (rather than sing) the lyrics over piano accompaniment.
Later acting career.
In the 1950s, Spivy spent several years touring Paris, London, and Rome before returning to the U.S. in 1957, where she embarked on a new career as a character actor, usually billed as Madame Spivy. She had supporting roles in the films "The Fugitive Kind, Studs Lonigan, All Fall Down, Requiem for a Heavyweight", and "The Manchurian Candidate", where her stout physique led to her being cast as matronly or villainous characters. She also appeared on stage in a Broadway production of "Auntie Mame". Her best-remembered television appearance is a darkly humorous installment of "Alfred Hitchcock Presents", the 1959 episode "Specialty of the House" in which she played the manager of a restaurant whose unsuspecting guests implicitly end up on the menu.
Death.
By 1969, Spivy had been diagnosed with cancer. Her friend Patsy Kelly arranged for her to move into the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, where she died on January 7, 1971, aged 64.

Nocoleche Nature Reserve

The Nocoleche Nature Reserve is an important conservation area in New South Wales located 20 kilometers south of the town of Wanaaring, New South Wales on the Paroo River.
History.
The traditional owners of the Paroo are the Budjair, Kunja, and Mardgany in the north and the Paruntiji, meaning people belonging to the Paroo, in the south. Aboriginal people are known to have lived along the Paroo for at least 14,000 years (Robins, 1999).
Graziers came as squatters to the Paroo in the 1840s. They met resistance from the Aboriginal land owners, and tensions in the area continued well into the 1860s. From the 1850s however a shortage of white labour caused by the exodus to the gold fields saw many in the Aboriginal communities join the pastoral workforce. Aboriginal people continued to be a significant part of this work force for many decades whilst still maintaining their cultural traditions and attending local and regional ceremonies until the 1910s. From the 1920s however, Aboriginal people began to be forcibly removed from their land by government policy.
In the 1880s through to the early twentieth century however, drought, severe overstocking and rabbit infestation led to massive damage to land, soil and native plants and animals.
Nocoleche station was established some time before 1887 by F.W. Armytage. By the early twentieth century the property was one of four substantial runs leased by Sir Samuel McCaughey on the Darling River. His total holdings were 3.2 million acres where he experimented with a number of farming implements and technologies, including using heavy machinery for ploughing and soil excavation, mechanised sheep shearing and widespread irrigation. The station changed hands eight times between Armytage and when the National Parks and Wildlife Service took ownership in 1978.
Description.
The covers the Paroo River, Cuttaburra Creek, Sandy Creek, Aarons Creek and Kulkyne Creek, and represent the largest wetland in the state by area. A large proportion, close to , representing 16%, of Nocoleche Nature Reserve is floodplain wetland.
Ecosystem.
Nocoleche Nature Reserve is dominated by mulga and white wood vegetation as well as Poplar box and black box. The Paroo River forms the eastern boundary of the reserve and it is here there is the largest stand of the very rare yapunya is found.
Large areas of yapunyah ("Eucalyptus ochrophloia") woodland can be found on the Paroo and Warrego Rivers and Cuttaburra Creek. Other plant species of conservation significance include the algae "Chara braunii", spikegrass ("Elytrophorus spicatus"), downy mother of misery ("Cuphonotus andreanus"), chariot wheels ("Maireana cheelii"), silver turkey bush ("Eremophila bowmannii ssp latifolia") and corkbark ("Hakea ivoryi").
Noclesche is an important stop over for migratory birds. Large mammals include Red kangaroos ("Macropus rufus"), eastern grey kangaroos ("Macropus gigantus"), western grey kangaroos ("Macropus fuliginosus") and common wallaroos ("Macropus robustus"), which are common throughout the nature reserve.
Fish including yellowbelly ("Macquaria ambigua"), Murray cod ("Maccullochella peelii"), silver perch ("Bidyanus bidyanus") and catfish ("Tandanus tandanus") are found in the Paroo river and are much sought after by professional and recreational fishers.
Cats, rabbits, goats, and foxes are all pests within the park.
Significance.
The Paroo River is not yet affected by river regulation and diversions, making it the last major free-flowing river in the Murray-Darling Basin. Both the Paroo and Warrego Rivers have extremely high conservation value.
Different types of wetlands with distinctive vegetation communities are found within the nature reserve. Plants, waterbirds, frogs, reptiles, fish and many invertebrates rely on these wetlands up and down the Paroo River.
Of the seven different types of wetland identified in the Paroo and Warrego River catchments, Nocoleche Nature Reserve has claypans, river channels and waterholes, Eleocharis swamps, lignum swamps and black box swamps. It does not have large freshwater lakes or salt lakes.
Nocoleche Nature Reserve is the only known location in New South Wales of "Aponogeton sp. aff. Queenslandicus" and the endangered "Dentella minutissima".
Heritage.
To date only seven Aboriginal sites have been formally recorded from Nocoleche Nature Reserve. European buildings that remain include the shearers’ quarters, cooks’ quarters, shearing overseer's cottage, store room, shower room/block, and toilet block.

Josiah Partridge

Josiah Partridge (March 1805 – 27 November 1897) was a lawyer in the early days of the British Colony of South Australia.
History.
Partridge emigrated to South Australia aboard "Rajasthan", an unaccompanied widower, arriving in November 1838 and settled on what became Partridge Street, Glenelg.
Partridge was one of the first seven lawyers to be registered in South Australia. He practised in Adelaide as a solicitor in partnership with James George Nash, and had a reputation for honest dealing. He was mostly involved in conveyancing until the Torrens Act reduced the amount of litigation involved in such transactions. He suffered a back injury from falling off his horse while commuting between Glenelg and Adelaide, and for many years he could not sit up, and around 1856 sold his business to Herford &amp; Boucaut, the latter at the onset of an illustrious career that would see him Judge of the Supreme Court and Premier of the Colony. A few years later he retired to "Malvern", a country property near Clarendon, where he remained. He recovered his health to some extent, and took daily horseback rides until his final illness. He became deaf, but his eyesight was perfect and he retained his mental faculties to the end.
Partridge married the eldest daughter of William Giles, of the South Australian Company. They both died at "Malvern", she a few years before him; they were survived by five sons and four daughters.
Family.
Josiah Partridge (March 1805 – 27 November 1897) was a son of Birmingham merchant John Partridge (1773–1840) and his wife Mary née Stroud (died 1853). He married Fanny Huckvale who died sometime before he embarked on "Rajasthan" for South Australia in July 1838.
He married Mary Giles (c. 1818 – 19 September 1893) in Adelaide on 25 June 1840. She was a daughter of William Giles, who arrived in SA in 1837. Their children included:
Several members of the family were interred at the Happy Valley cemetery

2018 English cricket season

The 2018 English cricket season ran between 1 April and 27 September 2018 and was the 119th in which the County Championship has been an official competition. It featured first-class, one-day and Twenty20 cricket competitions throughout England and Wales.
The season saw men's international tours by Pakistan, Australia and India, with Pakistan and India playing Test matches against England. The South African and New Zealand women's teams also toured England, each playing three One Day International matches against the England women's cricket team. The three teams also competed in the 2018 England women's Tri-Nation Series Twenty20 competition.
The 18 first-class counties competed in the 2018 County Championship, One-Day Cup and T20 Blast competitions, whilst women's teams played in the 2018 Women's Cricket Super League, 2018 Women's County Championship and the Women's T20 Blast competition. The 2018 Minor Counties Championship, MCCA Knockout Trophy and a new Twenty20 competition were competed for by the Minor Counties of England and Wales and club cricket was played throughout both countries.
International tours.
Three men's international sides toured England and Wales during the season: Pakistan, Australia and India. Pakistan also visited Ireland midway through the tour and played the Irish team's first Test match at Malahide near Dublin. In preparation for this match the Irish team played a first-class match against Somerset at Taunton in April. At the end of their tour Pakistan played two T20 matches in Scotland on 12 and 13 June. The England team played a One Day International (ODI) against Scotland in Edinburgh in June, losing to Scotland for the first time in an ODI.
The South African women's team also toured England to play three One Day International matches against the England women's cricket team in June and to compete in the 2018 England women's Tri-Nation Series Twenty20 competition against England and New Zealand. New Zealand then played three One Day Internationals against England in July.
In addition the West Indies men's side played a single Twenty20 International against a Rest of the World XI team at Lord's in May 2018 to raise funds for stadiums damaged by Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria in September 2017.
Pakistan tour.
Pakistan played two Test matches against England at Lord's and Headingley at the end of May and beginning of June. The series was drawn, each side winning one match.
Ahead of the Tests, two first-class matches were played against Kent and Northants. Their match against Ireland took place after the two first-class county matches, and a two-day match was played against Leicestershire between this and the first Test against England.
Pakistan won the first Test match by nine wickets on the fourth morning, playing "superbly but unspectacularly" to beat England comprehensively. The match was the first time England had lost the opening Test match of an English summer in 23 seasons. The BBC's cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew called England's performance "truly dreadful" and was shocked that England could be "outplayed so comprehensively by a touring team at home in May" whist praising Pakistan as looking "sharper, better drilled and more prepared". Pakistan's "focus on basics", coaching and management were praised by "The Express Tribune", whilst former Pakistan bowler Waqar Younis claimed that the win was his country's best at Lord's. Writing on CricInfo, George Dobell's view was that England's defeat was the "culmination of several years' of ECB policies that have disrespected Test cricket".
England won the second Test within three days, defeating Pakistan by an innings and 55 runs in an "emphatic victory".
South Africa women tour.
South Africa women played three ODIs against England during June with England winning the series 2–1, their ninth consecutive series win against South Africa. The matches formed part of the qualification process for the 2021 Women's Cricket World Cup and will be followed by a series of Twenty20 matches between England, South Africa and New Zealand.
South Africa won the first match at Worcester by seven wickets before England levelled the series at Hove after scoring 331 runs. The final match saw another strong England batting performance at Canterbury with Tammy Beaumont scoring her second century of the series as England won by seven wickets. Beaumont was named as player of the series.
England in Scotland.
England played a single ODI against Scotland at The Grange Club in Edinburgh on 10 June. The Scotland side scored 371/5 and bowled England out for 365 to win by six runs, the first time they had beaten England in an ODI. The Scottish score was the highest made by an Associate team against a Full Member side and included a score of 140 not out from Calum MacLeod. Despite a century from Jonny Bairstow, England fell short of what would have been their highest ODI run chase. The match is the England team's only away fixture during the 2018 English season.
Australia tour.
Australia played a series of five One Day International matches and a single T20 International against England in June. England won the ODI series 5–0, the first time they had achieved a 5–0 victory against Australia in an ODI series, and also won the T20I match. The series featured a world record score of 481/6 made by England in the third match of the series, a game they won by 242 runs, with Alex Hales and Jonny Bairstow both scoring centuries.
Australia played two warm-up one-day matches against Sussex and Middlesex at the start of June, winning both. After England achieved an "ugly win" in the first match of the series at The Oval strong batting performances saw them win the next three matches, including chasing a target of 311 runs in the fourth match, their highest run chase against Australia. The final match was closer, England eventually chasing Australia's score of 205 to win by one wicket, having been 114/8 in 29.4 overs at one point.
Tri-Nation series.
The England, South Africa and New Zealand women's teams competed in a three-way T20I competition between 20 June and 1 July. England won the final of the series, which was played at Chelmsford, defeating New Zealand.

The series followed the ODIs played by South Africa women against England and will be followed by an ODI series played between England New Zealand.
India tour.
India toured England between July and September, playing five Test matches, three ODIs and three T20Is against England. The T20I series was won 2–1 by India with the ODI series being won by England by the same margin.
Ahead of the Test matches, which were played in August and September, one first-class match was played against Essex. Before arriving in England, India played two T20Is against Ireland at Malahide, winning both.
England won the Test series 4—1, winning the first two Test matches of the series before India won the third.

A separate Twenty20 competition followed the County Championship between 10 June and 1 July with teams organised into a different set of divisions. Each Division One team played eight matches, one against each of the other teams in the Division, with Middlesex winning the title.
Women's Super League.
During August 2018 the ECB announced that the Women's Super League would be expanded for the 2018 season with more group games played. In 2018 each franchise played each other both home and away with 10 group matches per side compared to the five group matches played in 2016 and 2017. The group stage of the competition began on 22 July and ran until 18 August with finals day taking place at Hove on 27 August. Surrey Stars won the competition, defeating Loughborough Lightning in the final.
Minor Counties Competitions.
The Minor Counties Championship began in June and ran until September with teams organised in two divisions based on their geographical location. Each team played six three-day matches against six of the nine other teams in their division. The divisional winners Berkshire and Lincolnshire qualified for the four-day Championship Final which was played between 16 and 19 September at the Banbury Cricket Club Ground in Oxfordshire, with Berkshire winning the Championship.
The Minor Counties Knockout Trophy was played on a straight knock-out basis over five rounds, a change from previous seasons. Cheshire won the final with Devon the beaten finalists.
A new Twenty20 competition was introduced in 2018 with group matches played at the beginning of the season, replacing some of the matches previously played in the Knockout Trophy group stage. Counties were placed in four geographical divisions of five teams for the competition, each playing eight matches over four match days, with both matches against an opposition team being played on the same day as a double-header. A Minor Counties T20 competition was trialled in 2015 but has not been played since. The T20 competition was won by Berkshire who defeated Cheshire in the final.
The first stages of both one-day competitions were played at the start of the season with Championship matches moving towards the later half the cricket season. The Finals Days for both one-day competitions was played at the end of August at Wormsley Park in Buckinghamshire.

List of Parliamentary constituencies in the South East (region)

The region of South East is divided into 84 parliamentary constituencies which is made up of 23 Borough Constituencies and 61 County Constituencies. Since the general election of December 2019, 73 are represented by Conservative MPs, 8 by Labour MPs, 2 by Liberal Democrat MPs, and 1 by a Green MP.
Proposed boundary changes.
The Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before Parliament they were not brought forward by the Government for approval. Accordingly, they did not come into effect for the 2019 election which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.
Under the terms of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.
On 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Chloe Smith, issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. Subsequently, the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020 was passed into law on 14 December 2020. This formally removed the duty to implement the 2018 review and set out the framework for future boundary reviews. The Act provided that the number of constituencies should remain at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.
The Act specified that the next review should be completed no later than 1 July 2023 and the Boundary Commission formally launched the 2023 Review on 5 January 2021. The Commission have calculated that the number of seats to be allocated to the South East region will increase by 7 from 84 to 91. This includes the Isle of Wight which will have two protected seats, compared to one at present.
See 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies for further details.

Both are connected by Fueang Nakhon, the road is only 0.5 km (about 0.3 mi) long, and the road was built along Charoen Krung with Bamrung Mueang since the reign of King Mongkut (Rama IV). All three roads are the first formal roads in Thailand.
The term "Si Kak" () is a Teochew dialect meaning "four-way intersection" and "Sao Chingcha" (เสาชิงช้า) is a Thai word that refers to Giant Swing, a Hindu religious structure in front of Wat Suthat. In the past, there was also a Triyampawai ceremony during Songkran festival at the Giant Swing. The ceremony procession will begin at this intersection.

Georgina Castle Smith

Georgina Castle Smith (née Georgina Meyrick, pseudonym Brenda, 9 May 1845 – 27 December 1933) was a popular, productive English writer of didactic children's books. Some of her books highlighted the social needs of "street arabs" (homeless children) and encouraged people to donate clothing and food to them.
Background.
Georgina was the fourth child of a solicitor, William Meyrick (1809 or 1810–1898), in Bayswater, London, and his wife Eliza ("née" James, born 1817 or 1818). She suffered as a child from hay fever and asthma, which encouraged her to be bookish. Having appeared as the tenant of various premises in Bayswater, her father can no longer be traced after 1872. He may be the person of that name declared bankrupt in 1874. He appears to have deserted his family and died abroad.
Work.
All Georgina's books appeared under the pseudonym Brenda. The first, "Nothing to Nobody" (1873) predates the collapse to the family's finances. It tells of poverty and advocates practical philanthropy through the story of a Sunday school teacher reforming an orphan known as Daddy Long Legs. This was also published in the United States in an undated edition, probably from 1874.
The success of "Nothing to Nobody" encouraged "Brenda" to write a second, similarly didactic story, about two orphan boys in East London, of whom the younger dies: "Froggy's Little Brother" (c. 1875). This sold steadily for fifty years and was a frequent choice as a prize book awarded to children. A film appeared in 1921.
The illustrations for the second book were the work of a solicitor, Castle Smith (1849–1936). He and Georgina married shortly afterwards and settled in St John's Wood. They had five children.
"Brenda" had another 13 children's books published over the next 15 years. A further eight appeared between 1890 and 1932, including a sequel to "Froggy's Little Brother" in 1914. "Five Little Partridges, or, The Pilot's House" deals with the seaside stay of a middle-class family and may refer to her own children. "The Secret Terror" (1909) is set in high society, partly in India, and was one of the two works of hers aimed at adult readers.
Retirement.
The family retired to Lyme Regis in Dorset, where she died at her home, Corner Cottage, on 27 December 1933 and was buried in the cemetery there. The town community appears in "The Earl's Granddaughter" (1895), which describes how an upper-class girl is converted to good works.

Lazy Ways is the second album of the British Indie pop group, Marine Girls. The album was released by Cherry Red Records in 1983. The song "Lazy Ways" appears on the Cherry Red showcase compilation "Pillows &amp; Prayers", while "A Place in the Sun" appears on "Pillows and Prayers 2". The albums "Lazy Ways" and "Beach Party" were reissued together on one CD with bonus tracks by Cherry Red Records in 1988.
Reception.
The album reached #4 in the UK Indie Charts in April 1983. A single from the album "Don't Come Back" had reached #21 in February. AllMusic awarded the album with 4 stars and its review by Stewart Mason states: "The Marine Girls' second and final album - the group had already split by the time of its release, with Tracey Thorn pursuing a solo career before forming Everything But the Girl and the Fox sisters forming the even more minimalist Grab Grab the Haddock - is far more polished than their 1981 debut, at times almost approaching professionalism".
It was ranked at 42/50 among the "Albums of the Year" in 1983 by "NME".

360 video projection

A 360 video projection is any of many ways to map a spherical field of view to a flat image. It is used to encode and deliver the effect of a spherical, 360-degree image to viewers such as needed for 360-degree videos and for virtual reality. A 360 video projection is a specialized form of a map projection, with characteristics tuned for the efficient representation, transmission, and display of 360° fields of view.
Different projections.
Equirectangular.
An equirectangular projection simply maps the yaw and pitch (longitude and latitiude) of a sphere linearly to a rectangular image. It produces a signature curved look. In addition, the distribution of pixel density (which can be visualized with Tissot's indicatrix) is suboptimal, with the usually more important "equator" getting the lowest density.
Cube Map.
Cube mapping records the environment as the six faces of a cube. The image distortion is markedly reduced, especially when looking at the faces head-on. Still, the edges and corners of faces receive more pixels than the center.
Equi-Angular Cubemap (EAC).
The Equi-Angular Cubemap (EAC) projection is a variant of the cubemap that distributes the pixels evenly by angle. This keeps the density of information is consistent, regardless of which direction the viewer is looking. It was detailed by Google on March 14, 2017. In January 2018 the company started using the spherical projection to stream 360 degree videos on YouTube.
Pyramid format.
The Pyramid projection is a variation of the cubemap using a pyramid geometry. The video is rendered in multiple viewports (in Facebook's case 30) where the base of the pyramid contains the full resolution and is right in front of the viewer, while the sides are rendered with a gradually decreasing resolution. It was detailed by Facebook on January 21, 2016, mainly aimed at VR video. The company claims an 80% reduction in bandwidth with this projection, with the disadvantage that many more viewports need to be rendered and stored.

John Moynihan Tettemer

John Moynihan Tettemer (1876–1949) was the author of "I Was a Monk: The Autobiography of John Tettemer", a 1951 account of his life as a Passionist monk and member of the Roman Catholic priesthood.
Formative years.
Born in St. Louis, Missouri on May 16, 1876, John M. Tettemer was a son of Hanora Moynihan, a native of County Kerry, Ireland who had emigrated to America with her parents as a child, and Harvey J. Tettemer, a New Jersey native and manufacturer who became "the first man to bring shoe machinery west of the Mississippi river," according to historian Walter Barlow Stevens. Per Tettemer:
My parents made a fine combination. My father, Harvey Tettemer, was Pennsylvania Dutch and Presbyterian. My mother, Nora Moynihan, was County Kerry Irish Catholic, from Cloughnareeny, a place not important or even large enough for sophisticated maps of the world to show...
Mother had come to America with her father and many brothers when she was fourteen years old... She was a born story-teller. Her mother was a Connor of County Cork; telling us tales of Roderick, last high King of Ireland, she made us feel that it was exciting, but no cause for thinking ourselves better than anyone else...
The atmosphere of our home was strongly religious... My first record of a game is playing priest and hearing my playmates' confessions through the cane bottom of an overturned chair. The oldest brother, Harvey, would play at saying Mass and rigged up an altar in the back parlor, with candles and flowers and such linens as he could beg or remove surreptitiously from Mother's linen cupboard... I was his altar boy. My duty was to swing the censer, made of a tin can containing hot water, which I replenished whenever the steam ("smoke") died down.
His family experienced a brief period of financial difficulty when competitors to his father's business began operating in St. Louis. As a result, his mother took a job "as forewoman of the sewing girls" in a factory nearby. In addition, his father was able to obtain an unsecured loan from Morris Levi, a Jewish businessman in St. Louis. Tettemer would later recall that "Father used the incident to instill in us some understanding of a people that had experienced harsh tribulations throughout its history, and to lay on us the precept of judging men as individuals and children of God, not accepting ready-made, often prejudiced estimates."
During his early childhood years, John Tettemer's older sister, Mary, passed away. Sometime around this time, he also developed a speech defect which made it challenging for him "to pronounce certain combination of consonants." He later observed that this caused him to be "shy and silent," becoming even more so when teased by his siblings and other children. "I would listen like a small ghost to a story being told, or would lose myself in some book." His discomforts made him "sensitive to emotional appeals, in music, in tales of heroism and pathos, and to beauty in color," and "equipped [him] with a spontaneous sympathy for the feelings of others, whether human beings or animals, and with a sense of the utter wrongness of doing anything that may hurt." Although the defect lessened as he entered school, the condition had left its mark. The "fear of it ran deep and I became adept at substituting easier words for those which were difficult for me."
Educated in the parochial schools of St. Louis (St. Bridget's), John Tettemer excelled at grammar and mathematics, and was deemed ready for his First Communion by 1885. During summer breaks, he resided on the Montgomery County, Missouri farm of an aunt and uncle "about ninety miles from St. Louis," where he "rode horseback full-tilt over the countryside," and helped with grain threshing. After completing his schooling at St. Bridget's at the age of 14, he engaged in "a supplementary year of English, Latin, algebra, and geometry." His father then helped him obtain a job with the John L. Boland Book &amp; Stationery Company, "the largest wholesale bookstore west of Chicago," for which he was paid $15 per month to assist with office work and run errands. After several years in that role, he "was promoted to wholesale billing," where he assisted with the company's nationwide invoicing, a job he later noted had honed his powers of concentration. Ultimately, he left that job due to burdensome overtime hours. He then found similar work with the William A. Orr Shoe Company, a firm managed and partly owned by his father.
While recuperating at home from a cold at the age of 16, his mother gave him several religious books to read, including Alban Butler's "The Lives of Saints" which, he later said, "aroused in [him] a burning desire to do something with [his] own life that would have worth." At this juncture, he began reading only books which were religious in nature, "especially longer biographies of the saints," and became increasingly enthralled by the life stories of monks, whom he had come to believe were "the only ones who comprehended the true meaning of existence." This, is turn, inspired him to increase his attendance at church services. Sometime around this time, his 19-year-old sister, Nora, with whom he had shared an interest in entering the religious life, fell ill with a severe cold; she died from pneumonia just a few weeks later.
Religious life.
John Moynihan Tettemer subsequently "entered the Passionist Order of Monks in 1894," according to the "Sydney Morning Herald", "and made his theological studies in Rome, where he was ordained by Cardinal Respighi in 1901." Given the religious name of "Father Ildefonso, C.P.," (also reported in newspapers as "Father Alphonso"), he was assigned to the Passionist Monastery in Normandy, Missouri (known officially as "Our Lady of Good Counsel," but sometimes also referred to as "the Little Rome of the West"). The first Passionist monastery to be established west of the Mississippi River, it had been dedicated on June 7, 1891. John Tettemer later explained his decision:
I chose [the Passionist Order] for two particular reasons. I learned that it was the strictest and most contemplative of any of the modern orders which sprang up so numerously in the Church after the Counter-Reformation, and that it retained to a remarkable degree the monastic spirit and customs of the more ancient orders. Moreover, it maintained the original fervor of spirit of its founding, and strict observance of the rule.
In 1907, he was appointed as director of the International College in Rome and, in 1914, was appointed Consulator General of the Passionist Order. Per Tettemer:
In the spring of 1914, while still rector of the monastery in Kansas, I received a cablegram from Rome announcing my election, at the General Chapter then in session, to the office of Consulator General of the Order. This is the second highest office in the order, the general being the head.
I was only thirty-eight years of age, and this was big and unexpected news. The consulator, or assistant general, is usually chosen among the older, more experienced members of the order, after long years of service in successive offices... My duties [in Rome] would be more of an advisory nature, as the general and his four consultors ... formed the executive body that ruled the order. I would be consulted and would render my vote in all important matters pertaining to governing the order, but would have none of that detail work involving harassing decisions and the giving of orders, which I never found easy...
I stayed a day or two with my mother [in St. Louis], and then said a last good-by to her. My term of office was to be six years; she was already in her seventies and she really knew this time that she could hardly expect to see me again...
My father had died a year or two before, at the age of about seventy-six. He had been knocked down by an automobile as he was crossing the street, and his hip-bone fractured. The bone would not knit at his age, and he was an invalid in a wheelchair for six months... I was permitted once or twice in that time to visit him, but when pneumonia supervened as a delayed result of the shock of the accident, I was not present.
...As my father had been a leading Catholic layman of St. Louis, a great concourse of priests and laymen attended the funeral in the parish church. My brother and I said our Masses for Father at the two side-altars while the solemn requiem was being celebrated at the high altar, with the sanctuary crowded with priests.
After decades of religious training and service in one of the most austere branches of his church, he began to suffer health problems, and was ordered by his physician to take time away from his job to rest. During his recuperation, as he reflected on his life's direction, he developed an appreciation for contemplative practice, and when writing his autobiography later in life, described what had happened to him during this time:
My own native mind had had little opportunity to assert itself in the preceding years, as it had been too occupied with studying and teaching the ideas of others... During my 'quiet time,' realizing this, I allowed my mind total freedom to open to the riddle of the mystery of existence, which had marked the birth of my philosophic mind at the age of twenty or thereabouts and always had held a fascination for me in the years between... A new faculty of knowing seemed to be born in me, in the quiet stillness yet intense activity of consciousness within me. I seemed to touch the heart of reality, the very essence of existence, with a directness, an immediacy, rendering all my former knowledge false and illusory.
As a result, he requested release from his church obligations in 1916, a release which was subsequently granted by Rome. After leaving the priesthood, he then embarked on a more traditional journey.
Family and spiritual community.
On Friday, July 1, 1921, Hanora Tettemer, the 79-year-old widowed mother of Rev. John M. Tettemer, died in St. Louis. The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" reported in its July 3 edition that the she had suffered a stroke the previous Tuesday, and that "[s]olemn high mass [would] be sung at St. Paul's Church in Pine Lawn by her son, the Rev. Joseph H. Tettemer, the pastor," on Monday, July 4. This same funeral notice also mentioned that the Rev. John M. Tettemer was "stationed in Rome, where he is a member of one of the Roman Catholic congregations."
 Still active religiously during the 1920s, the Right Reverend John M. Tettemer, Auxiliary Bishop of the Liberal Catholic Church, was one of several celebrants at the opening ceremonies of the Theosophical Society in America's convention in Chicago, Illinois in August 1926. Among those in attendance were theosophist and women's rights activist Annie Besant.
John M. Tettemer then also officiated at the 1927 wedding of Susan L. Warfield, of Hollywood, to the Right Reverend Irving S. Cooper, Regionary Bishop of the Liberal Catholic Church in the United States and a lecturer for the Theosophical Society in America. The ceremony was held in the open-air amphitheater at Krotona. (One of the three most important centers of learning for Theosophical Society members during the 20th century, Krotona was located in Ojai, California.) Among those in attendance were Annie Besant and her protege, the philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti.
Before the decade was out, John M. Tettemer also became a family man. In 1928, he wed Ruth Elizabeth Roberts (1905-1982), a native of Great Britain and, in 1934, began to make a new life with her in California in "the mountains behind Beverly Hills," according to the foreword to his book, "I Was a Monk". Their three children were born between 1931 and 1935.
That same year (1928), The Right Reverend John Tettemer was based at St. Alban's cathedral in Los Angeles, but also officiated at church functions throughout California, including administering the rite of confirmation at St. Raphael's Liberal Catholic Church in Oakland.
Business and creative work.
When filing an application for a U.S. Passport in 1921, Tettemer stated that he was planning a trip both for his health and “to import American manufactured goods &amp; raw materials to Europe.”
From 1937 to 1943, he was cast in three uncredited film roles in Hollywood. In 1937, he performed the role of the priest, Montaigne, in the Academy Award-winning film, "Lost Horizon". In 1942 and 1943, respectively, he played a "Salvation Army Worker" and "Minister" in "Syncopation" and "The Leopard Man." According to the Internet Movie database, IMDB, his last name was spelled as "Tettener" on the cast rosters of those films. A 1940 edition of "The Pittsburgh Press" revealed more about how he became involved in the motion picture industry:
A handsome, white-haired man, dressed like a clergyman, stood on a crowded platform and delivered an opening invocation for a national political convention. The delegates and gallery guests were extras hired for Frank Capra's "Meet John Doe" ... part of the script written by Robert Rlskin. But there seemed to be something especially real about it. When a sequence of shots had been made, a bystander went over to the benign-looking speaker and said, "Were you ever a preacher or a priest? With that face, and the way you talked, you certainly" An actress interrupted: "I don't know who you are, but I wanted to say that that was a marvelous job. You had me praying, too." "Thanks," said the elderly man. "Character parts like that seem to be rather easy for me, I was a Tibetan monk in "Lost Horizon." My name's John Tettemer." The actor usually doesn't go into much detail about himself because there's so much to tell. For example, he recently completed an autobiography... His publishers wired they'd hold the manuscript until he could write a second volume bringing his life up to date. It happens that John Tettemer has been a monk, a priest, a teacher of priests, a specialist in canon law and theology for two colleges of cardinals, and assistant general (or vice chancellor) of the Papal College in Rome. It was in 1918 that he asked to be released from his vows. Plunged suddenly into the practical world, Tettemer taught Latin, French and mathematics. He found a few pupils in chess; then he learned bridge and taught that. In muddled Europe after the war, he tried the import-export business, did well, bought a couple of inventions which he brought to America and couldn't sell. He spent a year reading proof for an encyclopedia, tried mining and oil reclamation, and launched an advertising agency in Denver. The latter did all right until his partner absconded with all the assets. Tettemer came to California, ran a filling station, managed apartment houses, began tutoring college students, bought a small corner of the old Raymond Hitchcock estate near Hollywood and now lives there with his wife. Acting was about the only thing he hadn't tried, and he wasn't considering it when he had lunch with friend, John Burton, who was playing in "Lost Horizon," in 1937. Frank Capra spotted him and suggested a test for the Grand Lama role. But Tettemer appeared much too robust to be that saintly ancient; he became the monk who had been a pupil of Chopin. Much of his part had to be cut out, but Capra sought him again for "Meet John Doe," and there's little doubt that Hollywood's greatest scholar will have plenty of character roles after this if he wants 'em. Ever since leaving Rome, Tettemer has continued to explore all philosophies. It doesn't seem to have been the panicky groping of a disillusioned, bewildered man. He says he has the utmost sympathy with all religions “because each is effort to give form to faith." Occasionally Tettemer visits his old friends in the Passionist monastery at Sierra Madre, where he spent 25 years...
A U.S. Census worker described Tettemer's 1940 occupation as "writer and tutor." According to the "Los Angeles Times", "When John Moynihan Tettemer died in 1949 at the age of 73, he left the manuscript of an unfinished autobiography. Most of it he had written in a tiny adobe house on the desert near Victorville." This manuscript was then "edited by an old friend, Janet Mabie, after his death," and published by Knopf in 1951. The book went on to become a selection for spirituality-based book clubs, as well as the subject of sermons by religious leaders of various denominations.
Nicknamed "John the Divine" by his friends, Tettemer was an "expert athlete [and] equally skillful chess-player [who] was as much at home with people as with solitude," according to Jean Burden, the woman who wrote the foreword to his book. "Expert mountain-climber, skater, skier, and tennis-player, chess enthusiast, voracious reader of everything new in non-fiction and anything exciting in murder mysteries, a stickler for accuracy and for the correct use of words, vigorous individualist and champion of justice and American democracy ... [who loved God through his fellow men" was how Tettemer was described by John Burton in the introduction to Tettemer's autobiography.
Death and burial.
John Moynihan Tettemer died in Los Angeles County, California on May 14, 1949. He was then buried at that county's Westwood Memorial Park. Slightly more than three decades later, his widow, Ruth Elizabeth (Roberts) Tettemer, followed him in death, and was also laid to rest at the Westwood Memorial Park. Their daughter-in-law, Susan (Cronyn) Tettemer (1934-2004), the daughter of actress Jessica Tandy and stepdaughter of actor Hume Cronyn, was then also laid to rest at the same cemetery following her passing in 2004.

Drohobych salt plant

The Drohobych salt plant (), in existence since 1250, is the oldest working salt plant in Drohobych, Lviv region, Ukraine.
History.
The Drohobych salt plant has been in operation since at least the 13th century on territory close to sources of raw materials called "salt brine". The foundation of the salt plant was in 1250, and it is believed that this plant is the oldest working industrial company in Ukraine. During this time, Drohobych was one of the richest cities in the Carpathian region making this important in the history of the last decades in the existence of the Galicia-Volhynia principality.
Drohobych's growth was caused by the salt manufactory, which provided not only the Galician and Transcarpathia regions but also the Volhynia, Holm, and Kyiv regions with salt. In 1339 Drohobych was occupied by Polish seigniors and the Drohobych salt manufactory became the part of the royal property. At that time salt was the most famous good produced in Drohobych. Chumaks from the entire Ukraine area (Podillya, , and Volhynia regions) came to Drohobych to purchase salt.
Volhynia piers (found on the river Sluch and Horyn) were used to load Drohobych salt on the ships (called "komyaha"), then the salt was transported to Prypyat, and after that it was shipped along Dnipro straight to Kyiv. The towers in Drohobych, Yasenytsya, and other surrounding villages belonged to the king, where peasants were forced to work. The king never visited the area.
Rich Italian merchants rented salterns (salt water pools), because they had caravans traveling from Italy through Lviv and Bukovyna to Crimean city Kapha. During the 14th and 15th centuries these merchants were the intendants and the main workers of the saltern in Drohobych. This benefited King and merchants alike. Italians marchants produced high-quality salt, thus greatly expanding trade relations between Drohobych and Europe; however, this brought many conflicts in Drohobych. These conflicts were caused by the citizens' opinion that only some people were seeing profits. Conflict in 1491 between Italians merchants and Drohobych citizens was resolved with the help of the king's decree.
The king declared that people have to produce a cart (containing 6000 salt barrels). In the years after this, each citizen entering Drohobych was charged 3 dinnars per cart of either salt or other goods. Money was used to keep the Drohobych city streets in good condition. According to documents dating back to 1768, it is known that the upper layer of the road situated in Zhupna street (which exists today) was made of wood. The territory between the saltern and Zhupna Street was joined by the bridge constructed above the river Pobuk. At that time two wells could be found on the territory of Drohobych saltern: the King's saltern and baron Hartenberg's private saltern.
Proceeds from both of these two salters were used to fund a Cathedral hospital known as "the hospital for the poor". According to documents from 1565, 26,000 barrels of salt were produced in Drohobych; half of this was produced in King's saltern and other half by private salterns. Nowadays, Drohobych salt is producing two types of high-quality salt.

Das ist der Tag, den Gott gemacht

"Das ist der Tag, den Gott gemacht" (This is the day that God made) is a German Christian hymn for Easter. In the Catholic hymnal "Gotteslob" it appears as Gl 329.
History.
The text was written by Heinrich Bone (1813–1893), a pedagogue who is known for his hymnal "Cantate!" of 1847. When his song was included in the "Gotteslob of 1975", Friedrich Dörr (1908–1993) added two stanzas from 1972 to the original three stanzas.
The melody is attributed to Johannes Leisentritt (1527–1586) who is known for his 1567 hymnal "Geistliche Lieder und Psalmen der Alten Apostolischer recht und warglaubiger Christlicher Kirchen", one of the hymnals of the counter reformation.
Musical settings of the hymn include an organ version by Herbert Voß (1922–2006), a four-part setting by Volker Wangenheim (1928–2014), a four-pat setting with organ by (born 1935), and both a four-part setting (2012) and an organ setting (2016) by Ludger Stühlmeyer.

Conduit and Sink OFCs

Conduit OFC and sink OFC is an empirical quantitative method of classifying corporate tax havens, offshore financial centres (OFCs) and tax havens.
Traditional methods for identifying tax havens analyse tax and legal structures for base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) tools. However, this approach follows a purely quantitative approach, ignoring any taxation or legal concepts, to instead follow a big data analysis of the ownership chains of 98 million global companies. The technique gives both a method of classification and a method of understanding the relative scale – but not absolute scale – of havens/OFCs.
The results were published by the University of Amsterdam's CORPNET Group in 2017, and identified two classifications:
In 2017, the European Parliament adopted the CORPNET approach into their frameworks for addressing tax havens. In 2018, research by Gabriel Zucman showed that using Orbis database connections specifically underestimates the scale of Ireland, which the Zucman–Tørsløv–Wier 2018 list showed is the largest Conduit OFC in the world. This aside, CORPNET's Conduits and Sinks reconcile closely with the most noted academic top ten tax haven lists.
Background.
The lack of an accepted definition for identifying tax havens (and even offshore financial centres), results in different lists, including:
There are "traditional" tax havens common on all these lists (e.g. some Caribbean and Channel Islands locations), which some global regulators have either blacklisted, or have issued formal warnings/threat of sanctions against, unless transparency is increased.
However, a key difference between the lists regards the major OECD and EU tax havens (or offshore financial centres), such as Switzerland, Ireland the Netherlands and Luxembourg (amongst others). Major regulators like the EU and the OECD don't regard OECD or EU countries as tax havens, and point to their transparency and compliance with international regulations.
Academic leaders in tax haven research, and other non–governmental organizations, point to the role of OECD and EU tax havens in tax avoidance from base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) schemes, like the Double Irish, the Single Malt and the Dutch Sandwich. They regard them as major tax havens in their definitions of tax havens.
CORPNET Report.
A report published in Nature in 2017 on the analysis of offshore financial centres called: "Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers: Conduits and Sinks in the Global Corporate Ownership Network", provided a quantitative and scientific approach to the classification of tax havens.
The report was the result of a multi-year investigation by political economists and computer scientists in the CORPNET research group at the University of Amsterdam. CORPNET is a European Research Council funded group at the University of Amsterdam investigating networks of corporate control.
The report used the Moody's Orbis corporate database, to examine 98 million global companies and their 71 million ownership connections (using big data computer modelling) to identify 5 global Conduit OFCs (Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore and Switzerland). These are countries of high financial reputation (i.e. not formally labelled "tax havens" by OECD/EU), but who have "advanced" legal and tax structuring vehicles (and SPVs) that help legally route funds to the 24 tax havens (called Sink OFCs), without incurring tax in the Conduit OFC (or even tax in the source of funds location, where royalty payment schemes can be used).
The work built on methods established in the "Offshore–Intensity Ratio", and in particular the understanding "activity" relative to the "scale" of the domestic economy in a country. At its crudest level, the Offshore-Intensity Ratio explains why the countries at the top of global GDP per capita lists are mostly tax havens.
The EU Parliament's Policy Department on Economic and Scientific Policies included the research in its findings for the EU Committee on Money laundering, tax avoidance and tax evasion (PANA), and by tabulating against existing EU–IMF–FSI list of tax havens, showed material gaps in EU understanding of conduits.
CORPNET's top 5 Conduits and top 5 Sinks are 9 of the 10 largest tax havens identified in 2010 by one of the academic founders of tax haven research, James R. Hines Jr.. Hines' 2010 list of 10 major tax havens only differs in its omission of the U.K., which in 2010, had only just reformed its corporate tax system. CORPNET's top 5 Conduits and top 5 Sinks closely reconcile with the top 10 major corporate tax havens of other major academic and non–governmental organisation tax haven lists. Other tax academics have incorporated the research into their understanding of tax havens.
Conduit OFC.
Conduit OFCs are described as having advanced legal and tax systems designed to enable corporations to route funds from high tax locations (e.g. Germany) to the Sink OFCs (e.g. Bermuda). They tend to have attractive "holding company" regimes (e.g. no withholding taxes, foreign dividends exempt from taxes, capital gains reliefs, full double–tax relief), advanced tax treatment of intellectual property regimes, and large global networks of bilateral tax treaties.
For example, CORPNET's five major Conduit OFCs, all have a top–ten ranking in the 2018 Global Innovation Property Centre (GIPC) IP Index. IP has been described as the "raw materials of corporate tax avoidance", and "the leading corporate tax avoidance vehicle".
Conduit OFCs are shown to be dominated by major law firms and global accounting firms, who create the lawfully constructed special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and BEPS tools that make the connections with the Sink OFCs, by exploiting legislative loopholes such as the Double Irish and Dutch Sandwich. They advise clients on anticipating future changes (e.g. from OECD BEPS processes), that may need new loopholes (e.g. the Single malt arrangement).
Other researchers into tax havens have written that professional service firms in the major OECD and EU tax havens write most of their State's relevant taxation and SPV-related legislation, so that they can create and protect loopholes, and refer to such jurisdictions as being a "captured" by their financial services industry. The legal and tax structuring undertaken by Conduit OFCs is considered beyond the trust–structuring type work of the traditional tax haven "offshore magic circle" law firms. Conduit OFCs need structures that can integrate with bilateral tax treaties involving G20 countries, as well as meeting U.S. GAAP / SEC Regulations that U.S. multinationals, one of the largest users of Conduit OFCs, need to adhere to.
CORPNET's top 5 global Conduit OFCs channel 47% of corporate offshore connections and include the following:
Sink OFC.
Sink OFCs cover a broad range of locations from very small countries (e.g. the Marshall Islands), to major global financial centres (e.g. Hong Kong).
Just because funds reach a Sink OFC, does not mean that they remain dormant. Quite the contrary, the funds can be invested in assets all over the world, but their legal ownership and future gains remain in the Sink OFC. For example, the circa US$1 trillion of US company offshore cash is held in Sink OFCs (esp. the Caribbean).
The report highlighted some interesting aspects of the 24 Sink OFCs:
OECD failings.
CORPNET highlighted the lack of progress the OECD's Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project was making, and that the OECD's support of transparent intellectual property–based tax structuring (or "patent boxes" and "knowledge boxes"), is incompatible with the emerging position of intellectual property as the leading BEPS tool in conduit OFCs. The reasons for this failure are discussed in failure of OECD BEPS Project.
An example of an IP–based BEPS tool is Ireland's Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets (CAIA) tool, also known as the "Green Jersey", which has an effective tax rate of 0–2.5%. Apple used the CAIA (or Green Jersey) BEPS tool in Q1 2015, resulting in the "leprechaun economics" restatement of Irish GDP by 34.4 percent. Ireland has other IP–based BEPS tools (Ireland as the first OECD nexus-compliant KDB), and is a supporter of the OECD BEPS project (see box).
Isle of Man omitted.
The Isle of Man (the "IOM") was absent from the list of top Sink OFCs. The IOM appears on tax–haven lists and ranks 42 on the 2018 Financial Secrecy Index.
The Chief Minister of the IOM, Howard Quayle, announced that the CORPNET report proved that the IOM is not a tax haven. However, CORPNET researchers from the University of Amsterdam directly replied to Howard Quayle's article clarifying that while the IOM does not appear as a leading Sink OFC for corporate tax avoidance, it does not mean that individuals (personal bank accounts and trusts) do not use the IOM to avoid taxes, and particularly United Kingdom VAT.
Other commentators have added that the IOM is "failing as a tax haven", and is now too small to appear in major studies like the CORPNET research.
Ireland underestimated.
The CORPNET report used legal corporate connections on the Orbis database, rather than the actual "quantum" of money, as its primary metric of analysis. In theory, the authors felt that this does not impede the goal of classification, and of making relative rankings. However, it does mean the "monetary amount" of potential tax avoidance was not calculated.
The tax haven academic and author of "The Hidden Wealth of Nations", Gabriel Zucman, used a different quantitative approach. Zucman focused on macro–data of national statistical accounts. In theory, the total assets in a system should equal the total liabilities. By aggregating national account data, Zucman identified an excess of liabilities over assets, implying that the missing assets (to balance the equation), are hidden in tax–havens. On this basis, in 2015, he estimated that 8% of the world's wealth (or US$7.6 trillion) was "missing" in offshore tax–havens.
Zucman's analysis highlighted the special case of Ireland and why the Orbis database underestimates Ireland's scale as one of the world's largest corporate tax avoidance, or BEPS, hubs. In 2018, Zucman ("et alia") showed that many of Ireland's U.S. multinationals don't appear on Orbis (e.g. Facebook), or only have a small fraction of their data on Orbis (e.g. Google and Apple). Analysed using "quantum of funds" (not "Orbis connections"), Zucman showed Ireland is one of the largest corporate tax shelters in the world, and a route for Zucman's estimated loss of 20% in EU corporate tax revenues annually.

Wombats Rest, South Australia

Wombats Rest is a locality in the Australian state of South Australia located in the state’s east on the western side of the Murray River about north-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about north-east of the municipal seat of Mannum.
Its boundaries were created on 27 March 2003, for the “long established name.”
Land use within Wombats Rest is entirely residential accommodation whose historical use is for “‘holiday’ occupancy” and which is known as a shack site in Australia. Development within the locality has limits due to its location within the Murray River’s floodplain to “minimise damage to buildings” caused by regular flooding.
The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016, reports that Wombats Rest had a population of zero.
Wombats Rest is located within the federal division of Barker, the state electoral district of Chaffey and the local government area of the Mid Murray Council.

IDA Indoor Climate and Energy

IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (IDA ICE) is a Building performance simulation (BPS) software. IDA ICE is a simulation application for the multi-zonal and dynamic study of indoor climate phenomenas as well as energy use. The implemented models are state of the art, many studies show that simulation results and measured data compare well.
User interface.
The user interface of IDA ICE makes it easy to create simple cases but also offers the flexibility to go into detail of advanced studies. Many inputs are adaptable to local requirements such as climate data, material data, system components or result reports. IDA ICE provides a 3D environment for geometry modeling, the table-based input of boundary conditions provide good visual feedback and enables efficient quality check. A simple procedure for calculating and reporting cooling, heating, air demand, and energy, together with a built-in version handling system, makes it efficient to compare different systems and results. 
Advanced daylight calculation are achieved by interfacing the Radiance lighting simulation tool with result visualization in the 3D environment. A module for Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2010 is available, this is used for example in LEED and BREEAM. The integrated radiosity method with single reflexion and one measuring point can be used for whole-year daylight analysis and allows modeling daylight-based control strategies (e.g. shading devices, artificial lightening).
There is also the "Early Stage Building Optimization" (ESBO) user interface which makes it possible for users to experiment with variations in both buildings and systems at an early stage with a minimum of user input. A full range of component models for renewable energy studies is available, with boreholes, stratified tanks, heat pumps, solar collectors, CHP, PV, wind turbines, etc.
An interface with OpenFOAM for detailed CFD studies is in development.
Strengths.
IDA ICE can be used for complete energy and design studies, involving the envelope, systems, plant and control strategies. The equation-based approach enables solving more complex mathematical problems than software using imperative programming languages. The IDA ICE model library is open source, the model equations can be viewed and adapted, every variable in the whole system can be logged. The flexible architecture of the software makes it easy to develop the software continuously to adapt it to local requirements and languages, and to expand it with new capabilities. Additional features like parametric simulation runs and visual scripting support decision making in a parametric design process. The coupling with optimization engines like GenOpt is available directly in the program.
The big advantage compared to other BPS software is the coupled simulation of building envelope, systems and controls. IDA ICE library components are either written in the Neutral Model Format (NMF) or Modelica. The software is fully scriptable with Common LISP. The IDA general purpose solver comes with a variable timestep, which guarantees that no event in the system will be missed.
Input.
IDA ICE supports IFC BIM models generated by tools such as ArchiCAD, Revit, MagiCAD, and others. Geometry an shading on site can also be imported from SketchUp, Rhino or other geometry tools. Solar influx is evaluated through windows (also internal) with full 3D accounting for the local shading situation. Additionally it has an integrated geometry editor where building and zone geometry can be modeled with 2D architectural drawings or pictures serving as template.
Climate files like EnergyPlus weather files (EPW) or ASHRAE climate files, can be downloaded and installed. The table-based input structure allows full interoperability with MS Excel and comparable software. Modern features like copy and paste and Drag&amp;drop combined with visual input data check make input data management easier.
Output.
IDA ICE output include tables, charts, reports and plots. 3D visualizations (both stills and animations) show geometry, solar shadings, color coded input data as well as results. Arrow animations in 3D visualize ventilation air flows, window energy balance, and wind driven flows. There are special reports for LEED submittal forms included. The diagram plots deliver vector graphics which allows detailed result analysis in custom reports. Results can be exported to Microsoft Word or Excel. A single zone IDA ICE model with default systems comprises a total of approximately 2 000 time dependent variables, any of which may be plotted.

Ron Theodore Robin (רון רובין; born April 23, 1951) is an Israeli scholar whose research focuses on the interface between culture and foreign policy in the United States. He is a senior faculty member at the University of Haifa, as well as a Professor Emeritus at New York University (NYU). Currently Robin serves as the 11th President of the University of Haifa.
Career.
Robin was born in 1951 in Tel Aviv to Shani (Rozin), a Jerusalem-born scion of the Shaltiel family, and to Eli, a South African citizen who served as a volunteer in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Robin grew up in South Africa and returned with his family to Israel when he was 13 years old. He joined the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) in 1969. He served in the intelligence community, and was discharged with the rank of major.
In 1978, he was awarded a BA in romance languages and general history from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1986 he was granted a PhD in modern US history from the University of California, Berkeley. His thesis was entitled: "Signs of Change: urban iconographies in San Francisco, 1880-1915". In 1986, Robin returned to Israel and was admitted as a faculty member at the University of Haifa. Robin served as professor in the Department of Communications and the Department of General History and in 2000 was appointed Dean of Students, a position he held for five years.
In 2006, Robin moved to New York University, where he was appointed a professor in the Department of Media, Culture and Communications, and in 2007 was appointed Associate Dean at the NYU Steinhardt School.
In 2008, Robin was appointed Senior Vice Provost, New York University, and was responsible for the establishment of the two NYU international campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai. Robin's main role was to recruit faculty members for the new campuses.
In 2016 Robin was elected as the 11th president of the University of Haifa, and in October 2016 he assumed this role. Upon taking office, Robin conceived the program of transforming the University of Haifa into a Multiversity - a university with multiple campuses and research portals. In accordance with the program, the central campus on Mount Carmel will be complemented by other portals, specializing in strategic research and multidisciplinary cooperation. In order to implement the program, Robin initiated the integration of Braude Engineering College in Carmiel. The ultimate goal is to transform Braude into the university's Faculty of Engineering. He initiated a similar process with the WIZO Academic Center in Haifa, the objective being to create a new Faculty of Architecture and Design. In addition, an agreement was signed with the Rambam Health Care Campus for the joint establishment of "the Helmsley Medical Discovery Tower", a 20-story building with a cost of 400 million Israeli shekels (ILS), to be built at the Rambam campus. The center will integrate the research and medical activities of Rambam physicians and University faculty members in the fields of natural sciences, welfare and health, psychology, and more.
During 2017, Robin accompanied Benjamin Netanyahu on a mission to China, where he signed an agreement, on behalf of the University, with the CASIA institution of Automation, for the establishment of a research center in the field of artificial intelligence.
Academic expertise.
In contrast to the mainstream of modern American historians, who separate cultural history from diplomatic history, Robin's work combines the two currents, claiming that it is impossible to understand the foreign relations of the United States without understanding domestic cultural shifts. In his research, Robin describes US foreign policy in the 21st century as being "captive of the past", prisoners of an illusory perception, that the United States is under the same threats that cofounded the twentieth century. He describes the second Gulf War in 2003 as stemming from the perception of senior US officials that "another Pearl Harbor has to be avoided" - even though the cases of Iraq and Pearl Harbor are not at all similar.
In his latest book, "The Cold World They Made", published by Harvard University Press, Robin claims that US foreign policy in the 21st century is a reproduction of the foreign policy of the 1950s and 1960s, when the nation labored under the threat of the Soviet atomic bomb. This policy, he argues, continued without distinction between presidents, parties, or political leanings and is still valid today.
Personal life.
Robin is married to Levia (Livi) Wolf, and the couple has four children.

E. C. L. During Caspers

Elisabeth Christina Louisa During Caspers (1 September 1934 – 31 January 1996), known familiarly as Inez During Caspers, was a Dutch archaeologist.
Education and career.
During Caspers was born in Amsterdam in 1934. She studied both Mesopotamian and South Asian archaeology at the University of Amsterdam, graduating with an MA in Sumerian and prehistoric archaeology in 1962. She then went on to the Institute of Archaeology in London, where she completed her PhD in 1969. Her thesis, supervised by Seton Lloyd, was on maritime trade between Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley in prehistory.
In 1973, after spending several years working in the manuscript room of the University of Amsterdam library, During Caspers was appointed a lecturer at the Kern Institute of Indology at Leiden University. She remained at Leiden for the remainder of her career, taking a position at its newly-founded department of archaeology in 1986. She was the editor of the "Annual Bibliography of Indian Archaeology" (ABIA) for the years 1967–1969 and 1970–1972.
Suffering from cancer in her later years, During Caspers took early retirement in 1995. She began working on deciphering the Indus script, but the project she assembled was cut short by her death from heart failure in 1996.
Fieldwork.
During Caspers actively participated in fieldwork throughout her career. In 1966, she met Beatrice de Cardi, who was planning an expedition to Bampur in southwestern Iran. de Cardi invited During Caspers to join her small team as they attempted to relocate and re-excavate sites discovered by Aurel Stein in the 1930s. According to de Cardi's account, During Caspers' six-week stay was eventful. The team encountered outbreaks of both cholera and typhoid fever, and were stranded by car failures or fear of wolves on multiple occasions. During Caspers also received news of her father's death part way through the expedition, but stayed to help finish the work anyway. Just before she left the country, an Armenian workman who had become enamoured of During Caspers proposed to her, and had to be restrained from breaking down her hotel room door when she declined. Despite this "somewhat inconsiderate introduction to expedition life", During Caspers returned to Iran in 1970, joining C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky's excavations at Tepe Yahya.
Her introduction to Arabian archaeology came in 1975, when she joined Michael Roaf's expedition to al-Markh in Bahrain. In 1976, she organised her own expedition to Pakistan, where she and J. C. M. H. Moloney conducted an extensive photographic survey of major sites and museum collections. In the late 1970s she also planned excavations at Saar in Bahrain, but was unable to raise the funds. She returned the Gulf a final time in 1994, joining Jocelyn and Jeffrey Orchard's Hajar Project. At the time of her death, she was planning to follow this up with her own excavations at Wadi Bahla.

Parish of Nocoleche

The Parish of Nocoleche is a cadastral parish of Ularara County in north western New South Wales.
Climate.
The climate is semi-arid, featuring low rainfall, very hot summer temperatures and cool nights in winter. The parish has a Köppen climate classification of BWh (Hot desert). 
 However, the Paroo River at this point has a number of wetlands, which makes the parish somewhat of an oasis in the otherwise arid landscape.
History.
The traditional owners of the Paroo River area are the Budjair, Kunja and Mardgany in the north and the Paruntiji, meaning people belonging to the Paroo, in the south. Aboriginal people are known to have lived along the Paroo for at least 14,000 years (Robins, 1999).
The Burke and Wills expedition were the first Europeans to the area, passing a few miles to the west.
Graziers came as squatters to the Paroo in the 1840s. They met resistance from the Aboriginal land owners, and tensions in the area continued well into the 1860s. From the 1850s however a shortage of white labour caused by the exodus to the gold fields saw many in the Aboriginal communities join the pastoral workforce. Aboriginal people continued to be a significant part of this work force for many decades whilst still maintaining their cultural traditions and attending local and regional ceremonies until the 1910s. From the 1920s however, Aboriginal people began to be forcibly removed from
their land by government policy.
From the 1880s to the 1910 drought, overstocking and rabbit infestation led to massive damage to land, soil and native plants and animals.
In 1978 the parish was incorporated into the Nocoleche Nature Reserve.
These Paroo River Wetlands are today an important site under the Ramsar Convention.

Glossary of Broken Dreams

Glossary of Broken Dreams is a 2018 Austrian/American documentary film directed by Johannes Grenzfurthner. The essayistic feature film tries to present an overview of political concepts such as freedom, privacy, identity, resistance, etc.
Grenzfurthner calls his project an "ideotaining cinematic revue" about political ideas he considers important. Grenzfurthner cites frustration about the current level of political debate as a primary influence for making the film. He couldn't "tolerate ignorant and topically abusive comments on the 'Internet' anymore." So he teamed up with writer and activist Ishan Raval to: "explain, re-evaluate, and sometimes sacrifice political golden calves of discourse."
The film features performances by Amber Benson, Max Grodenchik, Jason Scott Sadofsky, and others.
The film was produced by art group monochrom.
Concept.
Johannes Grenzfurthner, who defines himself as a 'lumpennerd' in the film's intro, functions as a storyteller and host who guides the viewer through the narrative. "Glossary of Broken Dreams" is not making use of classic documentary-style interviews and aesthetics. Instead, the film presents different political and philosophical concepts in form of short films and essayistic chapters featuring fictional characters. These bizarre and exaggerated characters are performed by actors, voice performers and musicians (for example FM4's Hannes Duscher and Roland Gratzer). The film can be seen in the tradition of reflexive documentary films and performative documentary films.
In an interview with Film Threat Grenzfurthner describes his project as follows:
It's a peculiar film for nerds of a peculiar set of interests, but at the same time it's talking about topics that are so goddamn important that more people should know about it. I guess that's why I made it. No idea if there is even a target audience for it, but one can try. There is a lot to process. And cat meme drunk masses will probably not even scratch the surface. But my idea was: better to challenge the audience than to dumb it down.
The film incorporates art and illustrations by Bonni Rambatan, Matt J. Frith, James Brothwell, Clemens Kindermann, Stevyn Prothero, Steve Reeder in a variety of different cinematic styles. The film thus works as a fast-paced collage, utilizing a singer-songwriter duo, puppet shows, LucasArts-style pixel animation, Japanese anime, live action sequences and stock footage.
"Glossary of Broken Dreams" can be considered a loose follow-up of Grenzfurthner's first documentary feature "Traceroute", but expanding his critique of capitalist (nerd) culture.
Austrian and German media personalities (like Stefanie Sargnagel, Gerald Votava, Peter Hörmanseder, Katharina Stemberger and Jolyne Schlien Schürmann) make cameo appearances in the film.

"With Achmed Abdel-Salam (as Modern Subject) and Jim Libby (as Information Gaze)"&lt;br&gt;
This section delves into the co-evolution of privacy as a social value and the bourgeois economy, and critiques the current emphasis on privacy as failing to address underlying dominations in society. It introduces the idea, explored later in the film ("The Left"), of how computation and information could be liberatory under different property relations.
Nature Vs Nurture&lt;br&gt;
"With David Fine (as Pansexual German Paratrooper)"&lt;br&gt;
This story of a chimpanzee debates social conditioning.
Politics/Identity&lt;br&gt;
"With Andrea Nitsche (as Dr. Bulletpoint von Sganarelle) and Michael Smulik (as Politics)"&lt;br&gt;
A critique of the preponderance of politics today, predicated on identity, in contrast to a universalist approach to politics.
Democracy/Social Democracy&lt;br&gt;
"With Jeff Ricketts (as President Ödem von Horvath), Max Grodénchik (as Biological Male) and Kudra Owens (as Biological Female"&lt;br&gt;
The section questions the viability of social democracy in a globalized and financialized post-Fordist economy.
The Left&lt;br&gt;
"With Martin Auer (as Professor Alain Xavior Schnürlsamt), Johannes Grenzfurthner (as Harnulf Rohrkrepierer), David Dempsey (as Sven Shitpornson), Anna Behne (as Lady Unsquaredance), Jason Scott Sadofsky (as Billy Bob Turingengine) and Franz Ablinger (as Sailor Dieselfink)"&lt;br&gt;
Looking at the Left's inability to think or move past twentieth-century tactics, affects and campaigns, this section questions, ultimately, whether the correct course of action today might just be to give up on the Left, and try something better, more attuned to the possibilities and needs of the times.
Production.
Process.
The basic script was written by Johannes Grenzfurthner and Ishan Raval, supported by language consultant Chris S. Sims.
Due to the fast production process, the different chapters were written while other parts were already being shot and edited. Final decisions about length and content were made in the editing room.
On the basis of [the theoretical texts], I went on to develop the characters and the plot of the movie and started filming with the actors. At the same time, I was cutting scenes that were finished and started to put the movie timeline together. Everything was happening simultaneously. Compiling, writing, filming, cutting. And sometimes not even in this order. It felt like creating a jigsaw puzzle and trying to solve it at the same time. But in a short time – the production took about 5 months – it was doable without losing track completely.
Principal photography commenced August 4, 2017 and ended November 14, 2017. The film was completed on January 2, 2018.
With a budget of US$15,000, the film can be considered microfilmmaking and guerrilla filmmaking. In an interview with "futurezone", Grenzfurthner called the making of the film an ongoing process of "radical DIY". He worked with different teams of people on different chapters, for example LA-based filmmakers Sophia Cacciola and Michael J. Epstein, who were visiting Vienna for an art residency with monochrom at Museumsquartier.
The film's main language is English, but features various musical interludes by Duscher&amp;Gratzer and other music groups, performed in German.
Sound design.
Daniel Hasibar created the sound design and audioscape underlying Grenzfurthner's narration.
Music.
The film features music by Michael Donaldson, Inti-Illimani, wobblersound, Kasson Crooker, Duscher&amp;Gratzer, Bottervogel, Christoph Burstup Weiss, among others.
Distribution.
The film's world premiere took place at Diagonale Film Festival in Graz, Austria on March 16, 2018. The festival called it a "popcultural wholesale assault". The North American premiere took place at Vermont International Film Festival on April 11, 2018.
Grenzfurthner has a proactive approach to peer-to-peer file sharing. In his interview with Boing Boing he mentions that he put donation info into the film, anticipating its appearance on torrent sites.
The film was released on January 31, 2019 on Vimeo on Demand and can be bought or rented.
Reception.
Critical response.
Boing Boing says about the film: "Produced with a micro-budget, this monumental mosaic is taking the audience on a ride through an encyclopedia of overused, misconceived, and corrupted concepts and ideas. The fact that it concerns the favorite vocabulary of current discourses, the golden calves of contemporary controversy, makes for a considerably explosive force." Austrian pop culture magazine "Skug" calls the film "a swan song to the society of ignorance.". 
The Independent Critic's Richard Propes states that "Glossary of Broken Dreams is a nerdgasm of creative consciousness meets good intentions and abundant doses of intellectually informed human compassion. It'll fuck with your mind. Then laugh." Film Threat's Bradley Gibson says that it's "aggressive, doesn't pull punches, and burns through ideas at machine-gun rate ... 97 head-spinning minutes of core dump rage and frustration that is also entertaining and witty." 
Austrian magazine Profil calls it "a brilliant feat". Gaming and film website "Press Play" says that "sometimes it feels as if the entire content of Wikipedia would be rammed into your brain with a USB stick." ScreenCritix (UK) writes: "Grenzfurthner is our guide through a political minefield, giving us his notes like an angry chorus from the ancient Greek and Shakespearean plays ... an unmethodical survey of a gargantuan topic." 
"CelebBeat" writes: "The movie delivered on many more levels than I expected possible. It has the potential to break into echo chambers and filter bubbles; it can empower people by providing them with a deeper understanding of the human condition." "It's really hard to deny the expert way this movie was pieced together. It's a mix and match party of epic proportions. Old school video game graphics. Puppets. Musicians, anime, the kitchen sink. There's no shortage of style but more importantly, somehow these things all co-exist in seemingly perfect harmony." RDTB says: "If Slavoj Zizek would create Kinder Surprise Eggs, this film would be in them." UK Film Review's Annie Vincent says about the film: "A highly intelligent and topical film, Glossary of Broken Dreams is an engaging epistemological documentary that will have you chuckling about, choking on, and considering the validity of, your political ideology." "MicroFilmmaker Magazine" likes the "uncompromising attitude" and "unique taste", but questions the experimental nature of the film and its accessibility: "No real-world interviews were conducted on camera, which surprised me since these are the bread and butter of many documentaries. ... Is it a narrative film? Is it a documentary? Is it both?" 
"Film Inquiry" gave a negative review and called the film an "exhausting, maddening experience" while The 405's Ana Leorne states: "Glossary of Broken Dreams would be a proper commedia if it weren't so tragic — and yet it cleverly plays with both classifications, either juxtaposing or simply interchanging them, thus contributing to the ultimate proof of the non-existence of binaries." 
In the September 2018 issue of "Ray Kinomagazin", Oliver Stangl gives the film a positive review and calls it "a crazy survey of the present situation".
Awards.
The film won the Award of Merit for Feature Film at the 2018 Accolade Global Film Competition and for Documentary Feature at the 2018 IndieFest. It won Best Experimental Film at the 2018 Subversive Cinema Awards, won Best Feature Documentary Foreign at the 2018 Indie Gathering Awards, won Best Hacker Film at the 2018 HOPE Conference, won the Award of Merit for Feature Documentary at the 2018 Impact Doc Awards, and won the main award (Best Feature Length Film) at the Austrian Film Festival Awards 2018.

Niiro

Niiro (煮色 "cooked color"), also known as "niiro-eki" (煮色液), "niiro-chakushoku" (煮色着色), "nikomi-chakushoku" (煮込み着色) or "niage" (煮上げ) is an historically Japanese patination process, responsible for the colouration of copper and certain of its alloys, resulting in the "irogane" class of craft metals, including "shakudo", "shibuichi" and "kuromido". It is now practiced in a number of countries, primarily for the making of jewellery and decorative sword fittings, but also for material for hollowware and sculpture. Importantly, the same process operates differently on different metals so that a piece with multiple components can be treated in one patination session, developing a range of colours.
Etymology.
All forms of the name refer to the nature of the patination process in Japanese, as this was an exclusively Japanese technique. "Ni-iro" refers to boiling or broiling, and colour ("iro"), as the patination is performed by heating the metal to be treated in a special liquid or solution ("eki"). "Ni-age" also refers to boiling. "Chaku-shoku" refers to colouring. 
Process.
Formulation.
The colouring and finishing of "irogane" surfaces generally involves polishing and cleaning, followed by the active chemical patination, and often further includes some waxing or other final treatment. A small range of chemical components are used in the process, with various of recipes for their combination; all traditional formulae include the compound called rokusho (緑青) but at least one modern formula omits rokusho as a distinct ingredient.
Sample formulae include:
Notably, O Dubhghaill concluded after a study that common salt aided the effectiveness of the formula, while plum vinegar, often mentioned as an additive, he found to be unhelpful.
Preparation.
Cleaning is vital for both quality and predictability of the process. At the end of the preparatory phase, a piece to be coloured will also often be scrubbed with, or dipped in material from, a daikon radish. The precise contribution of the radish to the whole process is still under study.
Boiling.
The actual boiling in solution is usually done in a copper container, with the piece to be coloured suspended in some way, for example in a bamboo basket. The final colour can depend on the duration of the boiling period - suaka, for example, may advance from a light brown after 2-4 hours, to orange-brown after 6 hours, to red towards 10 hours. 
Finishing.
After the core patination process, a piece may, optionally, be washed in cold water, dried, and then coated with a light wax, or in modern times, a sprayed resin.
Colour range.
Colours developed through the niiro process include:
The material known as yamagane ("mountain metal"), naturally occurring copper with impurities, produces a wide range of colours, depending on its precise composition.
Study.
Some analysis of treated surfaces done in an attempt to understand the topic further, with considerable but still partial success. Researchers, some of whom also have a craft background, have also explored ways to make the process more predictable, and / or simpler, and at least one patent has been filed in this area. Murakami, Giumlia-Mair, O Dubhghaill and Jones, and Kawasaki are some of the scholars in this area, with O Dubhghaill (also a metalworker) and Jones, and Kawasaki, also working on "new" methods. 
Practitioners.
In Japan, certain workshops and a range of craft workers actively use niiro techniques. Techniques are passed down in craft circles, represented by trade bodies, and within at least one major university, the Tokyo University of the Arts, often known as "Geidai," the metalwork department of which preserves formulae and techniques. In the West, craftspeople actively using niiro include Cóilín Ó Dubhghaill.
Effects.
The traditional patination methods have little or no effect on silver and gold elements, allowing for interesting effects. Other effects are created by cutting through layers of patination to let underlying surfaces show through partly.
History.
The method has existed for at least 600 years but if some of the alleged origin timings for shakudo are valid, then, since niiro is intrinsically linked to the production of that patinated alloy, its history may extend over 1200 years.
The details of the processes and especially the compositions of the materials used to bathe the metals, are passed on within Japanese craft circles, and not widely documented, though some information was written down from the middle of the Edo period, and published more generally, in Japanese, in the early 20th century.
Attention to niiro and the irogane metals it produces came to the West in the late 19th century, in a period when the metalcrafts of Japan were in decline due to changes in tastes.

Mollie Lentaigne

Mary Evelyn Lentaigne (born 6 May 1920) is a British former medical artist and Red Cross Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse who worked at the Queen Victoria Hospital, England, during the Second World War. She is known for the drawings she made there of the surgical procedures of New Zealand plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe who was working on injured servicemen. Around 300 of her drawings are held by the East Grinstead Museum where they form the Mollie Lentaigne Collection.
Early life and family.
Lentaigne was born on 6 May 1920 to Lt. Col. Edward Charles Lentaigne DSO and Cecilia Mary Lentaigne in Simla, British India. Her brother, second lieutenant John Wilfred O'Neill Lentaigne MC of the Rifle Brigade, died in 1942 at El Alamein. In 1955, she married Timothy Ingram Lock. They had four sons and two daughters.
Lentaigne came from a family with several distinguished medical ancestors. These include her grandfather, Sir John Vincent Lentaigne (1855–1915), who was an Irish surgeon and president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland between 1908 and 1910. Sir John was himself the grandson of the surgeon Benjamin Lentaigne who was born in France in 1773, but, as a Royalist and firm supporter of King Louis XVI, was forced to escape to England at the age of nineteen. He went on to earn a medical qualification in England and join the British Army. He was posted to the Dublin barracks in 1775, and was involved in the treatment of Wolfe Tone, the leader of the 1798 Irish Rebellion, during his imprisonment and the final days of his life.
Second World War.
During the Second World War, Lentaigne worked as a Red Cross Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse at the Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, West Sussex, where her duties included drawing the experimental operations of Archibald McIndoe and his fellow surgeons. She needed to work quickly in the operating theatre and so used pencil but subsequently added ink and colour to some of her work.
Her drawings have uncovered material on the Guinea Pig Club, a club formed of Archibald McIndoe's surgical patients, many of whom were severely burned Royal Air Force pilots and aircrew.
Legacy.
Around 300 of Lentaigne's drawings have been preserved at the East Grinstead Museum, as the Mollie Lentaigne Collection. After the surviving Guinea Pig Club members used social media to search for Lentaigne and found her living in Zimbabwe, she returned to East Grinstead in 2013 to be reunited with her work.
In 2015, the Queen Victoria Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and the West Sussex Record Office were awarded a £72,952 Wellcome Trust grant for the digitisation of over 600 Guinea Pig patient files and the accompanying drawings by Mollie Lentaigne.
In 2018, Alexander Baldwin of the University of Birmingham won the Norah Schuster Prize of the Royal Society of Medicine's History of Medicine Society for an essay on the medical drawings of Mollie Lentaigne.

Archaeological excavations.
In 1981, Fatunsin began excavating Igbo'laja and Ijebu-Owo site in Owo town to discover what was known as Owo terracotta. Babasehinde Ademuleya from Obafemi Awolowo University noted that her examination was the second time that the town was being excavated after the 1976 visit of Ekpo Eyo. However, Fatunsin is observed to be the first to give a comprehensive description to the characteristics of the sculptures.
Museological career.
Fatunshin has written about the role of archaeology in Nigerian museums and the impact of it on cultural heritage in the country. She has been recognised as a pioneer of postcolonial archaeological thought and interpretation in Africa.

Frazer Clarke (born 7 August 1991) is a British amateur boxer. He won bronze in Tokyo at the 2020 Summer Olympics.
In December 2015, he won the super heavyweight division at the Rio 2016 test event.
In 2016, he was ultimately overlooked for Olympic qualification in favour of fellow super heavyweight boxer Joe Joyce (who went on to claim the silver medal in Rio 2016); however, he did make the British Lionhearts squad for their maiden WSB final against the Cuba Domadores and won his match against Lenier Pero, thereby denying the Domadores what would have otherwise been a 10–0 whitewash.
In 2017, he contested the European Championships and finished with a silver medal despite tearing his hamstring en route to the final. The subsequent operation required to mend it forced him to miss that year's World Championships.
In 2018, he beat Satish Kumar in the Commonwealth Games super heavyweight final, taking a unanimous judges' decision to claim gold.
In 2019, Clarke was selected to compete at the European Games in Minsk, Belarus, where he suffered a surprise defeat to Nelvie Tiafack in the round of 16. On his World Championships debut, he was originally deemed to have beaten Maksim Babanin by split decision (3:2) in the quarterfinals; this result was later overturned by a bout review jury on appeal.

Aprilia RSW-2 500

The Aprilia RSW-2 500 (also known as the RSW 500) was a racing motorcycle made by Aprilia, which raced in the 500cc class of the Grand Prix motorcycle racing, starting from 1994 until 2000 (with an absence in 1998).
History.
The chief designer of the Aprilia racing division, Jan Witteveen , made some comparative calculations between the cornering performance obtained in the MotoGP from the 500 and 250cc bikes and he found that the latter managed to get less travel time than the bikes of the premier class thanks to the greater speed allowed by their chassis. Therefore he thought that if a 250 had a more powerful engine available to recover the disadvantage in acceleration and top speed along the straights, he would also have had the opportunity to compete against the bikes of the upper class. With the weight advantage guaranteed by the regulation (105 kg minimum weight for the two-cylinder and 130 kg for the four cylinders), here the Dutch engineer went to work to prove on the field the goodness of his theory.
Initially the RSW-2 500 was a larger version of the motorcycle used by the Noale team in the 250 class (the Aprilia RSV 250), whose capacity was initially brought to 410 cm³; towards the end of the 1996 season it was raised to 430 cm³, then in the middle of the 1997 season it was again raised to 460 cm³. The bike was ridden by Doriano Romboni.
In 1998, the bike was not deployed because of the study of a custom engine, which allowed Aprilia to return in 1999 with a 500 cm³ engine ridden by Tetsuya Harada, with the RAVE valve to control the electronically controlled exhaust.
In 2000 the Aprilia brought two bikes on the grid, led by Harada (nº 31) and Jeremy McWilliams (nº 99). This last evolution had an inclined aluminum double beam frame, a 42 mm upside-down Öhlins fork and APS progressive system with an Öhlins shock absorber on a carbon swingarm, in which both suspensions were fully adjustable. The braking system was equipped with a double carbon disc at the front and a single 190 mm steel disc at the rear and the wheel rims were made of magnesium alloy.
The RSW-2 500 was not very successful in the premier class; although it was a very agile motorcycle (with a total weight of 110 kg, similar to the Honda NSR500, against the 130 kg of the 4 cylinders), it never managed to compete seriously with the 4 cylinders. The bike had a power of about 140 horsepower at 11,500 rpm, compared to the 200 hp of the 4 cylinders; the last models produced were equipped with an injector for indirect injection.
In 2000, Aprilia decided to pull out of the 500cc class. In the 7 years of the RSW-2 500 project, the bike managed to gain 5 podiums and 2 fastest laps, the last of which came in the 2000 British motorcycle Grand Prix.
After the closure of the RSW-2 500 project, Aprilia re-appeared in the premier class in 2002 with the introduction of the MotoGP class (which had replaced the 500cc class), with the new Aprilia RS Cube.

Trachyrincus scabrus

Trachyrincus scabrus, the roughsnout grenadier or Mediterranean longsnout grenadier, is a species of bathydemersal marine fish from the subfamily Trachyrincinae, part of the family Macrouridae. It is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean.
Description.
"Trachyrincus scabrus" has a large head which measures a quarter to a thirds of the length of the body and which has along, pointed snout with a ridge on side which extends posteriorly to the operculum, The mouth lies beneath the snout and the large eye has a diameter of 24-29% of the head length. The anterior dorsal fin has 11-12 fin rays, the posterior begins just behind the anterior and is much longer than the anal fin. The pectoral fin has 20-22 fin rays and the pelvic fin has 7 fin rays, although it may infrequently it has 6. It has spiny scales which are enlarged along dorsal and ventral profiles, 23-42 such scales sit dorsally behind a vertical line from the anus, but there are none ventrally before the anus. They are greyish-brown in colour. It grows to over 50 cm in total length.
Distribution.
The roughsnout grenadier occurs in the eastern Atlantic from the continental slope off western Ireland south to Namibia, including the waters off the Azores and the Cape Verde Islands. In the Mediterranean Sea it is known from the waters around Spain and Morocco, the Ligurian Sea and the seas around Greece.
Habitat and biology.
"Trachyrincus scabrus" is a bathydemersal, non-migratory fish which occurs at depths which range from 400m to 1,700m over soft substrates. Its main food is pelagic copepods but also takes mysids, shrimps, cephalopods, fish, polychaetes and gastropods. This species spawns in winter, during February and March in the Mediterranean. The maximum recorded age of species is 10 year, the specimen being collected in the Ionian Sea.
Fisheries.
"T. scabrus" is taken as bycatch throughout its range but it is usually utilised to make fishmeal and oil. International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has advised that for the years 2016–2020 there should be no directed fisheries effort for this species and that any bycatch should be counted against the total allowable catch so that any potential misreporting through misidentification is minimised. In most years landings were negligible and in the only year ICES had statistics, 2012, 57 tonnes were landed in the whole of the north-east Atlantic.

Gulf of Riga campaign

The Gulf of Riga campaign was fought by the Soviet Navy against the Kriegsmarine during Operation Barbarossa in 1941.
Background.
During World War I, the Gulf of Riga in the Baltic Sea played a strategical role in naval warfare and was target of the German offensive during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga and Operation Albion. During World War II, after the first weeks of quick German advance alongside the Baltic coast, the Soviet Navy begun operations to clear enemy mines, lay own defensive minefields and dispatching warships (including destroyers) into the Irben Straits to harass German naval shipping to supply their forces by sea. The Soviet Navy in the Baltic Sea at the time was under command of Admiral Vladimir F. Tributs.
German commander of the Baltic operations was Hubert Schmundt; who, differently from the Soviets, could only commit lighter naval units including S-boats.
June Operations.
Both sides laid extensive fields of mines in the Irben Straits: German operations begun on 21 June 1941 (mines laid by S-boats) and others were laid on the next days; such mines caused early damage to the light cruiser and the destroyer two days later in the Irben Straits, while her sister ship was sunk. On 24 June it was Soviets turn to lay mines in the Irben Straits and this was accomplished by the destroyers , and , supported by the light cruiser and the destroyers , , and : over 500 mines were laid in the next two nights. Soviet mines caused the loss of German S-boats S-43 and S-106 on 26 June, the following day other losses were suffered with the sinking of minesweeper R-205 and damage to M-201, R-202, R-203, R-53 and R-63.
The first direct clash between the opposing forces occurred on 27 June, when German S-boats S-31 and S-59 torpedoed and damaged, with heavy casualties, "Storozhevoy". The ship did not sink despite losing her entire bow up to the (nautical) and returned to service after extensive repairs only on 19 September 1943, while the destroyer was torpedoed by S-54 and later scuttled by the Soviet motor torpedo boat n°73.
July Operations.
Soviet destroyers "Serdity" and "Silny" had a surface engagement, on 6 July near Kolka during a minelaying mission, with the German minesweeper M-31 and the larger support-ship MRS-11/Osnabruck: despite enjoying absolute superiority. Soviet ships failed to hit the enemy and "Silny" received a direct hit from the minesweeper (suffering four dead).
Soviet naval units attempted a first attack on a German convoy (Riga was in German hands since 3 July) on 9 July but the attack, carried out by four MO-4 class patrol boats against a group of 6 motorboats with 4 logging ships, was unsuccessful. In July Soviet mines kept on causing damages to minor German units in the Irben Straits: the minesweeper "M-201" sunk and "M-23" was beached, but both were later salvaged while "M-3131" was lost. New Soviet mines were laid by destroyers "Serdity" and "Silny", covered by "Stoiky", "Grozyashchy" and "Smetlivy". However "Strashny" suffered heavy damage by mine on 9 July. On 13 July a coordinated attack of Soviet aircraft and motor torpedo boats managed to sink a German transport and damage 2 barges and 23 minor barges off Riga. Another mixed attack was carried out on 26 July when a plane sank the German minesweeper "R-169".
Soviet destroyers suffered their third loss when "Serdity" was hit on 18 July by Ju-88 bombers of Kampfgruppe 806: the ship was scuttled on 22 July after failed attempts to move her.
August Operations.
At the beginning of August, Germans were still laying mines in the Irben Straits. On 1 August, Soviet motor torpedo boats attempted an attack, covered by two destroyers, against S-boats off Cape Domesnas but they only lost the motor torpedo boat "TK-122" in the process. Between 6 and 8 August, the destroyers and shelled German coastal artillery batteries in the Moon Sound. On 17 August however, four Soviet motor torpedo boats attacked off Cape Domesnas again; and during the engagement the German minesweeper "M-1707 Lunenburg" was first shelled by Soviet ground artillery and then strayed into mines and sank.
Three days laters Germans retaliated when "S-58" torpedoed and sank the Soviet minesweeper "T-51" Pirmunas in the Moon Sound. The final Soviet destroyer action occurred on 21 August when the destroyers and "Surovy" made an unsuccessful attack against a convoy: they managed to force the only escort unit, the auxiliary gunboat "SAT-1 Ost", to run aground (later recovered) but this prevented damages to the convoy.
Aftermath.
The campaign reached its peak with the fall of Riga on 3 July 1941: Soviet destroyers attacked German convoys of barges and small merchants, but failed to stop this traffic and lost three destroyers in the process. While the Soviet units retreated to Tallinn, the Germans completed swept the Soviet defensive minefields.

Treaty of Nicolls' Outpost

The Treaty of Nicolls' Outpost is a little-known (because never ratified) treaty between Great Britain and the Red Stick Creek and other refugee Native Americans. Under it, Britain was to recognize the Native Americans as subjects of the Crown, and defend them and their territory from the United States.
The treaty was the product of a March 10, 1815 meeting at Nicolls' Outpost, a small fortification built by Colonel Edward Nicolls just south of the U.S. (Georgia) border (in modern Chattahoochee, Florida). Attending, besides Nicolls, were four other British officers, Capt. George Woodbine, Capt. Joseph Ross, Henry Ross, and William Hambly, about to depart after the conclusion of the War of 1812 in early 1815. Representing the Native Americans were Neamathla, Francis the Prophet, Peter McQueen, Thomas Perryman, his son William Perryman, and more than thirty others, the whole of what was about to become a new ethnicity, the Seminoles.
In the Treaty the Native Americans promised allegiance to Great Britain, which in turn accepted them as subjects of the British empire. (This is why the Union Jack was raised over the Negro Fort.) The hope was that Britain would provide them with protection against the United States and help them recover their land taken since 1811, which the Treaty of Ghent, ending the War of 1812, said they were to receive. Specifically they meant the huge territory lost under the Treaty of Fort Jackson, which the Red Sticks had not signed and claimed did not apply to them. Nicolls, a champion of Native American rights, created this treaty on his own initiative, without authorization.
The outcome was the famous trip of Francis and his son Earle, escorted and hosted by Nicolls, to London, though Nicolls had unsuccessfully recommended to Francis that he not make this trip. Francis, as well as the informal leader of the Red Sticks, was the most articulate Native American at the meeting. He was the representative of the Native Americans, hoping Britain would sign the treaty.
Great Britain, having just ended the unpopular War of 1812, was not interested in further armed conflict with the United States. The Regent refused to see Francis, sent him home (not without his meeting a number of prominent Englishmen), and chastised Nicolls.
The draft treaty is among the papers in the British War Office. Note that it is not called the Treaty of Nicolls' Outpost (or anything else). The name "Nicolls' Outpost" for the fortification was not used until the 1950s.

1920–21 Southampton F.C. season

The 1920–21 season was the 26th season of competitive football by Southampton, and the club's first in the Football League. At the end of the previous season, Southampton were one of a host of Southern League clubs elected to make up the new Third Division, finishing second in the inaugural season behind champions Crystal Palace. The Saints began the season strongly, winning seven of their first ten games to begin a lengthy run at the top of the league table until the end of the year. The club began to lose against several teams lower in the table in December, dropping a position as Palace continued to win the majority of their games. Southampton finished the season in second place with 19 wins, 16 draws and seven losses, four points behind the champions and one point ahead of third-placed Queens Park Rangers.
In the 1920–21 FA Cup, Southampton beat fellow Third Division sides Northampton Town (after a replay) and Grimsby Town to reach the third round, before being knocked out by eventual semi-finalists Cardiff City. The club ended the season at Fratton Park with the annual Hampshire Benevolent Cup charity match against local rivals Portsmouth, which the hosts won 1–0 through a goal from Harold Buddery. The game was notable for featuring right-back Tom Parker in goal, who was forced to fill in for the injured Tommy Allen. Southampton also played three friendly matches during the campaign, beating newly formed Welsh club Bridgend Town 3–1 in October, losing 1–0 to former Southern League rivals Aberdare Athletic in March, and drawing 1–1 with Third Division opponents Reading in the Berkshire Charity Cup in May.
Southampton used 21 different players during the 1920–21 season and had ten different goalscorers. Their top scorer was centre-forward Bill Rawlings, who scored 18 goals in the Third Division and four in the FA Cup. Inside-forwards Arthur Dominy and James Moore each scored 12 goals in the league, with the former also netting three in the FA Cup. Seven new players were signed by the club during the campaign, with four released and sold to other clubs. The average attendance at The Dell during the 1920–21 season was 12,599. The highest attendance was 21,363 for the FA Cup third round match against Cardiff City; the lowest was around 7,000 for matches against Reading on 1 January, Northampton Town on 9 March and Newport County on 2 May 1921 (the latter of which was the final home fixture of the season).
Background and transfers.
At the end of the 1919–20 season, manager Jimmy McIntyre made several changes to the Southampton squad in preparation for their first season in the Football League. Scottish goalkeeper George Wilcock, who had joined the club just a year earlier, was sold to struggling First Division side Preston North End in May 1920, where he made seven appearances in the top flight before dropping out of league football at the end of the season. He was replaced by former Sunderland goalkeeper Tommy Allen, who was brought to The Dell for free after his former club "had forgotten to include [him] on their end-of-season retained list". Centre-forward George Jones, another recent signing who had scored five goals in seven appearances in the club's last Southern League campaign, joined Yorkshire non-league side Goole Town. Arthur Andrews, who had established his place at right-half the previous year, was forced to retire from professional football following a broken leg in January, with Southampton releasing him at the end of the season.
Later in the summer, former Saints left-half Len Butt returned to the club from Thornycrofts, while Northern Irish centre-half George Moorhead joined from Sunnyside as cover for Alec Campbell. In September, centre-forward George Reader joined from Exeter City for a fee of £50. However, due to the form of Bill Rawlings, Reader's opportunities in the side were limited – after only three league appearances, he left at the end of the season to focus on a teaching career, playing part-time for Harland and Wolff. The following month, the club signed outside-right Frank Wright from Hamstead Colliery, who made just one appearance (described by club historians as "a poor showing") before being released at the end of the season. In November, forward-turned-half-back Percy Prince was also released by Southampton, returning to his former club Boscombe. Towards the end of the campaign, Southampton signed centre-forward John Cooper and inside-right Henry Johnson from Birmingham &amp; District League side Darlaston.

Third Division.
Southampton's first Football League campaign began on 28 August 1920 with an away fixture against Gillingham, who had finished bottom of the Southern League Premier Division the previous year. The match ended in a 1–1 draw, with Arthur Dominy scoring the club's first goal of the season (and in the division) with a shot "from an oblique angle". Dominy scored another two goals two days later in a 4–0 home win over Swindon Town, with the other two goals coming from Joe Barratt and Bill Rawlings. In their first ten games of the campaign, Southampton dropped only three points from a possible 20 (one in the opening day draw, and two in a 3–2 return loss at Swindon Town), securing the top spot in the Third Division table in early October following consecutive pairs of victories over Portsmouth (last season's Southern League Premier Division champions) and Norwich City. Rawlings took over from Dominy as the season's top scorer on 18 September, when he scored the only goal in the away fixture against Portsmouth, his fourth of the season.
The club continued their unbeaten run until their 17th game of the season on 4 December, when they were beaten at home for the first time in almost a year at the hands of Grimsby Town, who picked up an unlikely 1–0 win after the Saints saw Tom Parker miss a penalty and James Moore sent off. The Mariners also won the return fixture at Blundell Park a week later 3–0, as the only side to win both matches against Southampton during the season. Despite holding on to the top spot in the league into the new year, a winless run of four games saw the club drop below Crystal Palace, who had continued to pick up wins over the Christmas period. Losses at Northampton Town and Southend United helped Palace to extend their lead at the top of the table, with Southampton dropping down to third for a few weeks in February.
On 19 March 1921, Southampton picked up their biggest win of the season when they beat Merthyr Town 5–0 at home, with Bill Rawlings becoming only the club's third player to score four goals in a league match (after John Fraser and Fred Harrison, the latter of whom scored five in two games, both in the 1902–03 season). Two 1–1 draws in two days against the league leaders at the end of the month left Southampton with too much ground to make up in the final period of the season. In the first game, at The Dell, the visitors equalised in "the very last seconds" which "caused such excitement that several barriers at the Milton Road end [of the ground] collapsed, injuring several spectators". In their last nine games of the season the Saints picked up just ten points, from two wins and six draws, which left them trailing five points behind Crystal Palace, who secured the only Second Division promotion place in the division. They finished just one point ahead of third-placed Queens Park Rangers and two ahead of Swindon Town in fourth place.
FA Cup.
Southampton entered the 1920–21 FA Cup in the first round against fellow Third Division side Northampton Town. The Cobblers held the Saints to a goalless draw in a "gruelling first round match" at the County Ground on 7 January 1921, although by the end of the game Southampton were "well on top". This form carried over into the replay four days later at The Dell, which the hosts won comfortably 4–1 thanks to two goals each from on-form forwards Arthur Dominy and Bill Rawlings. Receipts for the fixtures were £1,017 and £1,118, respectively, which set a new record for each ground. Grimsby Town, another Third Division club, were Southampton's opponents in the second round on 28 January, having beaten Norwich City in the previous round. Despite losing both fixtures against the side the previous month, Jimmy McIntyre's side picked up a 3–1 away win over the Mariners thanks to two goals from Rawlings and another from Dominy, who described his team as "faster [and] more together as a side" following the result.
In the third round of the tournament, Southampton faced their first higher-league opponents of the season in Cardiff City, who were then placed third in the Second Division. The fixture was described by club historians as "a game of missed chances", which the Welsh side won with the only goal of the game after approximately 20 minutes following a "rare defensive mistake" by the Saints. The match against Cardiff City marked the highest attendance at The Dell during the season, exceeding 21,000 for the only time that year, as well as the second time the ground's receipts record had been broken as the club brought in £1,708 from attendees. The club played the same lineup in all four matches in the tournament. Cardiff City ultimately made it to the semi-finals of the tournament for the first time in their history later that year, beating First Division side Chelsea 1–0 in the fourth round after eliminating Southampton, before being knocked out by fellow second-tier club Wolverhampton Wanderers 3–1 in a replay on 23 March.
Other matches.
Outside of the league and the FA Cup, Southampton played four additional first-team matches. The first was a friendly match against newly formed Welsh side Bridgend Town on 18 October 1920, which the Saints won 3–1 thanks to goals from Arthur Dominy, Fred Foxall and James Moore. The next took place the following March and saw the club facing another Welsh side, Aberdare Athletic, which they lost by a single goal. On 11 May 1921, they travelled to face local rivals Portsmouth at Fratton Park for the annual Hampshire Benevolent Cup charity match. The game – which drew a record crowd for the competition of 6,740 – saw the visitors forced to play right-back Tom Parker in goal in place of Tommy Allen, who had been injured, in the absence of a suitable replacement. Portsmouth won the game 1–0 thanks to a headed goal from Harold Buddery around 15 minutes into the second half, marking their eighth win of the competition (to date, the Saints had only won three times, with one match ending in a draw). On 14 May, a week after the last game of the league campaign, Southampton ended their season at fellow Third Division side Reading in the Berkshire Charity Cup, drawing 1–1 with a goal from Dominy.
Player details.
Southampton manager Jimmy McIntyre used 21 different players during the 1920–21 season, ten of whom scored during the campaign. The team played in a 2–3–5 formation throughout the campaign, with two full-backs, three half-backs, two outside forwards, two inside forwards and a centre-forward. Three players appeared in all 46 league and FA Cup matches: outside-left Fred Foxall, inside-left James Moore and left-half Bill Turner. Left-back Fred Titmuss played all but one league match during the season, and goalkeeper Tommy Allen appeared in all except two. Bill Rawlings finished as the club's top scorer for the season, with 18 goals in the league and four in the cup. Arthur Dominy scored 15 times across both competitions, while James Moore matched his league tally of 12 goals. Centre-half Alec Campbell and right-half Bert Shelley were the club's highest-scoring half-backs of the season with three league goals a piece, and right-back Tom Parker was the highest-scoring defender with two goals.

Johan Hendrik Christiaan Basting

Johan Hendrik Christiaan Basting (20 September 1817 – 24 September 1870) was a Dutch army surgeon and friend of Red Cross founder Henri Dunant. He played an important role during the establishment in 1863 of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and from that year on he was an advocate for the establishment of a national voluntary aid organization in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Red Cross established in 1867.
Biography.
Youth, early career, and marriage.
Basting was born in Enkhuizen on 20 September 1817, the son of hospital master Dingeman Cornelis Basting and Frederika Sophia Wilhelmina Schneider. He was 17 years old when he was admitted as a student at the National Institute for Military Medicine in Utrecht. In 1839 he became army physician Calss 3. In 1844 Basting was placed in Breda , where he became Officer of Health Class 2. After a short interim period in Maastricht, he was transferred to Gorinchem. In 1853 he was promoted to Officer of Health Class 1 and transferred to Leiden. The following year he married in Gorinchem with Amalie Fréderique Kattenbusch, born in Eschweiler. He received his PhD in Leiden on 12 March 1855. In the same year he was transferred from Leiden to the Regiment Grenadiers and Jagers in The Hague where he would stay until 1870, with a short break due to an interim transfer to Bergen op Zoom
First contact with Henri Dunant.
A certain Pauline Micheli-Revilliod advised Henri Dunant in 1862 to send Johan Basting a copy of his book "Un Souvenir de Solferino". Dunant had written it after having witnessed the suffering at the Battle of Solferino. He then asked Basting to translate the book from French to Dutch. Basting did so, and became fascinated by the Dunant's plea in his book to set up voluntary organizations in all countries that could become lifesaving in the case of armed conflict. The Dutch translation of Dunant's book appeared in Dutch in 1863
Establishment of the Red Cross Movement.
On September 8, 1863, Basting participated on behalf of the Netherlands in the 5th International Statistical Congress that took place in Berlin. Dunant was also present at his invitation because it gave both the opportunity to inform the participating countries about Dunant's idea to set up national aid associations in all countries. Dunant and Basting were helped by Bastings wife, Amalie Kattenburg-Basting, who had met Basting in Gorinchem. Amalie helped with translations and the layout of pamphlets that were distributed there and with the haste and adaptation of the invitation for an international conference that they hoped to organize in October that year in Geneva with interested countries. The lobby in Berlin was a success and already in October of that year the first International Conference of the Red Cross took place in Geneva. On 22 August 1864 this led to the Geneva Convention, ratified by 16 countries. This laid the foundation for International Humanitarian Law . The committee in Geneva, then consisting of five Swiss including Dunant and later called the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), became the custodian of International Humanitarian Law.
Establishment of a national Red Cross Society in the Nederlands and his death.
Earlier that year, in April 1864, Basting published a leaflet called "Eene roepstem tot mijn vaderland: De hulpmaatschappijen tot verzorging van zieken en gekwetsten" in which he pleaded for the establishment of a national Red Cross Society in the Netherlands. In 1866, Basting moved from The Hague to Bergen op Zoom. Despite Bastings' call and the support he received from people like Henry CN Baron van Tuyll of Serooskerken and General Knoop, after a four-year long period of delays, on 19 July 1867, by a Koninklijk besluit, the "Nederlandsche Vereeniging finally granted aid. to sick and wounded warriors in time of war . Because of the protection sign to be used in wartime - a red cross on a white surface - the association was soon called the Nederlandse Rode Kruis, but officially the association did not name it until after 1895. In 1868 Basting contributed to the establishment and organization of local Red Cross aid committees in the Netherlands with his book "De Nederlandsche Hulpkomités onder het Roode Kruis. Hun werkkring in tijden van oorlog en vrede". Their office in times of war and peace . He also put this into practice himself by setting up a Red Cross auxiliary committee in Bergen op Zoom on 24 March 1868. 
Basting became ill in the spring of 1870 and died on 24 September that year as a result of liver disease in The Hague. He was buried on the 27th of September at Oud Eik en Duinen in The Hague.
Importance to the Red Cross.
In the early years, Basting was the main international promoter of Dunant's plea to establish national Red Cross associations. Although Dunant had previously been present as an observer at the conference in Berlin, he had been given a specific mandate from the "Committee of Five" in Geneva. But at the urging of Basting, Dunant in Berlin, without any consultation with his Geneva colleague committee members, added three points to the plea that Basting presented, including the principle of Neutrality. Once in the invitation and in the agenda, co-founders could not simply ignore this. Johan Basting subsequently proved also to be crucial during the subsequent International Conference in 1863, in particular with regard to the introduction of the principle of Neutrality for Red Cross volunteers and medical objects such as ambulances, clinics and hospitals in times of war. Henri Dunant wrote to his Dutch friend and journalist Haje that it was "avec sa tenacité hollandaise" (his Dutch tenacity) that had been the decisive factor in the endorsement of the fundamental principle of Neutrality by the States present. "In the Netherlands, Johan Basting was important because of his advocacy for the establishment of a national volunteer aid association, the Netherlands Red Cross Society.
Basting's Réveil background.
Basting, his Swiss friend Dunant, and the first Red Cross volunteer who - together with another Swiss (Dr. Louis Appia, with Dunant and three other Swiss co-founder of the ICRC) - was sent to a war front, the Dutchman (and painter / writer) Charles William Meredith van de Velde, were all born in a Calvinistic Réveil environment. The Réveil movement originated in Geneva at the beginning of the 19th century in response to The Enlightenment. All three had from childhood learned to take care of others, for example Dunant visited with his parents prisoners, and they helped poor in their community. Basting and his wife Amalie have translated a number of writings from the Geneva Réveil theologian and philosopher Jules-Ernest Naville from French into Dutch. And Dunant organized meetings for fellow believers in Geneva. Van de Velde has visited one or more such meetings in Geneva, Basting has likely never been in Geneva. It was this international network of Dunant that brought him in contact with Johan Basting in 1862. Dunant was a critic of institutionalized church and was an agnost. 
Tomb Oud Eijk en Duinen, The Hague.
Basting was buried in The Hague. In 1871 the Dutch Red Cross placed this gravestone on its final resting place.

Rachel Scott (women's education reformer)

Rachel Scott, born Rachel Cook (8 March 1848 – 27 November 1905), was a British women's education reformer, based in Manchester, who organised and promoted equality for women.
Early life and personal education.
Rachel Susan Cook came from an academic family in St Andrews, one of five sisters. Her paternal line included three generations of divinity professors, including a Moderator of the Church of Scotland. Her education was at St Andrew's senior school, Madras College; by a private tutor; and then as one of the first 6 female students enrolled at the College for Women at Benslow House in Hitchin, which later became the University of Cambridge's Girton College, with another Scottish woman, Louisa Innes Lumsden. At this time, such women graduates were "rather special people ... exceptionally able, determined, ambitious". In 1873, Cook "graduated" as one of the first women at the University of Cambridge with honours in the classic Tripos, at second class.
This achievement was significant given the challenges women faced in higher education. Sarah Woodhead, Cook and Lumsden were considered "the Girton pioneers", with Cook also described as "a tall, dark, willowy beauty with the melancholy air of one of Rossetti's nymphs, classical features and graceful movements. George Eliot described her as "sylphlike", and the most beautiful woman she had ever seen; and there still remains in the minds of those who knew her then a memorable picture of her uncommonness, her dramatic instinct and critical quickness, and her eagerness and radiance of mind.
Campaign for women's education.
In 1874 she married Charles Scott, known as C. P. Scott, editor of the Manchester Guardian, and moved to Manchester, where she soon joined the governing body of the city's Girls' High School. She continued to champion women's higher education by creating a home-based university level teaching facility, supported by sympathetic professors from Owens College. Through her unstinting efforts this became incorporated into Owens College in 1883.
Scott also served on the Withington Girls School governing body and was interested in the co-educational school Lady Barn House School and took a lead role in education in the City; her eloquent elocution at public events to raise support for education for women and girls, was remarked upon on in her obituary.
Her final speech in 1900 was in the Free Trade Hall to the assembled Manchester High School for Girls community.
Publishing anonymously, Scott translated classical Latin and French texts, including Balzac’s "Human Comedy" with Clara Bell and others, as well as a guide to pictures in the Manchester Jubilee Exhibition of 1887. With her husband who was the editor, she contributed critical items to the Manchester Guardian supporting women's right to vote as a suffragist.
Scott's influence and contribution to the city of Manchester was recognised in her husband's obituary.

The Renegades (band)

The Renegades were a British rock band which started out in Birmingham in 1960. The band never had much success in their home country, but they became popular in Finland in the 1960s and in Italy from 1966 until their breakup 1971.
In the mid 70s Kim Brown and Mick Webley, with other musicians, went on to form the band Kim &amp; The Cadillacs.
History.
The Renegades formed in the early 1960s in Perry Barr, Birmingham. The original lineup included Kim Brown on vocals, lead guitar and keyboard, Denys "Denny" Gibson on guitar, Ian Mallet on bass, and Graham Johnson on drums. Their track “Hungarian Mod”, a reworking of Franz Liszt’s “Hungarian Rhapsody” in a Mod style, was featured on 1964’s “Brum Beat”, a compilation album put together by David Gooch to promote local Birmingham bands.
Not finding much of a foothold in England, the band found greater success in Finland after a tour in Helsinki in October of 1964. Causing a kind of fanaticism in Finland nearly comparable to Beatlemania in the UK, the Renegades became known for their energetic stage performances, as well as the outfits they wore, styled after American Civil War era Cavalry uniforms. In addition to their own songs, they often covered rock and R&amp;B standards, such as Ray Charles’ “What'd I Say”. While their single “Cadillac” reached number two on the Finnish charts in 1964, the band never had a number one hit. The band also appeared in the Finnish 1966 film "Topralli", by director Yrjö Tähtelä. 
The Renegades also toured and released music in Germany, France, Switzerland, Sweden, and Italy. The band also proved to be popular in Italy, and the group was invited to play at the Italian Sanremo Music Festival in 1966.
Denys Gibson left the band at the end of 1966 and was replaced by Joe Dunnett. Dunnett was subsequently replaced in September of 1967 by Mick Webley.
Between 1966 and 1970, The Renegades recorded several singles for Italian release, most sung in Italian, including “L’amore é Blu”, which reached the Italian Top Twenty. The group eventually disbanded in 1971, with Brown and Webley going on to form the band Kim &amp; The Cadillacs, with Johnson as their manager.
In 2019, drummer Graham Johnson, the last living member of the Renegades, played three concerts in Helsinki with the Finnish group Pekka Tiilikainen &amp; Beatmakers called "The Renegades Revisited". They played several more concerts in the summer of 2021.

Benjamin Whittaker

Benjamin Whittaker (born 6 June 1997) is an English amateur boxer who is affiliated with Firewalker ABC.
In 2018, he was picked to represent England in the 2018 Commonwealth Games, which took place in Australia's Gold Coast.
In 2019, he was selected to compete at the World Championships in Yekaterinburg, Russia, where he won the bronze medal after losing by unanimous decision to Dilshodbek Ruzmetov in the semi-finals.
In 2021, at the men's light-heavyweight category at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Whittaker won the silver medal against Arlen Lopez, who won gold.
Whittaker tweeted, "You don't win silver, you lose gold. I'm very disappointed - I feel like a failure."
Distraught from falling short of gold, he refused to wear the medal at the ceremony; however, he vowed he would return to win gold, saying: "I'll come back, trust me."
Whittaker's passionate reaction drew mixed reactions, but most people were empathetic of Whittaker's reaction. English media personality Piers Morgan tweeted: "Love this - finally, an athlete at these Olympics prepared to tell the truth about competing in elite sport. Good for you @BenGWhittaker".

Get Your Gun

"Get Your Gun" is a song written by Lynsey de Paul and Terry Cox. It was released as a single by Zakatek (aka Lenny Zakatek) on Bell Records on 12 October 1973. The b-side was another de Paul and Cox penned song "Gotta Runaway". Both sides were produced by de Paul and the strings were arranged by Christopher Gunning and de Paul. It has been described as "Freaky, bizarre and ultimately interesting and a definite one-off".
A German language version with the title "Roter Mann" with German lyrics written by Gunter Gabriel was released in 1974, also on Bell Records and sung by Zakatek. This version was released on the German compilation album, "1000 Nadelstiche - Amerikaner Und Briten Singen Deutsch" ("1000 pin pricks - Americans and Brits sing in German") on Bear Family Records in 2002.

Made from Plate

Made From Plate is an album released by tax-scam label Tiger Lily Records as the debut album of a band called Onion. In reality, like Hotgun, released by Guinness Records the album was a composite, created from unpublished demo recordings made by several different unsigned performers. One of the rarer albums released by Tiger Lily Records, only two copies are known to exist.
Album release.
As the release of a tax scam label, the album came with minimal documentation beyond songwriting credits and claims that the songs had been published by a company owned by Charles Koppelman and Martin Bandier. However, this may be a false claim, in the same way that the documentation on Hotgun claimed that the original songs on that album had been published by R. Stevie Moore's father.
Record collector Scott Blackerby discovered the album in 2011 and diagnosed it as a composite created from unpublished demo tracks, based on the multiplicity of songwriters, the fact that some of the tracks sounded unfinished, and the differing musical styles involved. This was confirmed in 2013, when Dan Chapman, friend of one of the credited writers, Dennis Wilkerson contacted Blackerby. He revealed that at some point around 1970 he and Wilkerson after having some success with a high school rock band, had been contacted by a producer named John McCauley who offered to professionally produce their music. In the end the project did not result in a recording contract and the pair went their separate ways. Many years later Wilkerson had been contacted by a record collector in Europe who had obtained a copy of Made From Plate and was trying to track down the songwriters.
It is likely, as with the tracks that made up Hotgun, that the recording studios who supplied the tracks for Made From Plate sold them to Tiger Lily Records as a means of recouping the recording costs.

Morden Depot

Morden Depot is a British rolling stock depot on the London Underground Northern line, and is located to the south of Morden Underground station. It was opened in 1926, when the City and South London Railway (C&amp;SLR) was extended from Clapham Common to Morden.
History.
In 1913, the City and South London Railway (C&amp;SLR) and the London Electric Railway (LER) were granted authorisation by separate Acts of Parliament to carry out works on their underground routes. The City and South London Railway needed to enlarge its tunnels to accommodate larger rolling stock and the London Electric Railway obtained permission to construct tunnels to connect the C&amp;SLR at Euston to its Hampstead Tube station at Camden Town. The work was delayed by the onset of the First World War and both companies obtained further Acts of Parliament to extend the time limits allowed for the works. Increases in the costs of materials and labour following the war meant that building and maintaining underground railways was no longer economic, and by 1921 the country was in recession, with nearly two million workers unemployed. In order to ease the situation, the government passed the Trade Facilities Act 1921, which enabled companies involved in projects that would create employment to borrow money, with the treasury guaranteeing both the capital amounts and the interest payments. Lord Ashfield, the chairman of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London, which owned both the City and South London Railway and the London Electric Railway, applied for and was granted powers to borrow £5 million under the scheme, which allowed the two projects to proceed.
The Trade Facilities Act 1921 had allowed the treasury to guarantee a total of £25 million, and the scheme was extended by the passing of the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act 1922, which increased the amounts of funding to £50 million, while extending the time limits by a year. With the prospect of being able to borrow more money, the London Electric Railway obtained an act that authorised an extension of the Hampstead Tube from Charing Cross (now Embankment) to Kennington in 1923, while the City and South London Railway obtained an act for an extension southwards from Clapham Common to Morden, where a new depot would be constructed. The extension was funded by issuing 4.5 percent debenture stock, backed by a government guarantee. Work on the extension started on 31 December 1923 at Clapham, and the line and the depot were opened on 13 September 1926.
In order to run the extended service, the first trains of what became known as Standard Stock were ordered. 191 cars were ordered in 1923 from three manufacturers, with a further 127 in 1924 and 120 in 1925. All of the cars were delivered by road, the 1923 Stock going to Golders Green Depot, the 1924 batch going to both Golders Green and the newly constructed Morden Depot, while all of the 1925 build was delivered to Morden. Stock delivered to Morden was stored until the line to Clapham was opened. The cars were towed to Morden by traction engines, mounted on road bogies. Two tall gantries were erected, which enabled the cars to be lifted, for the road bogies to be removed. A railway steam crane was then used to place the railway bogies onto the tracks, and once mounted on them, the City and South London's diminutive steam locomotive was used to move the cars to the stabling sidings.
The line southwards from Clapham runs almost entirely in tunnel, emerging into the open air just to the north of Morden station. Tracks continue southwards beyond the station, passing under the A24 road to reach the depot, which is only accessible from the northern end. At its southern end, the depot is hemmed in by Morden South station and the tracks of the Sutton Loop Line. Within the depot there is a large car shed, with open-air sidings to either side of it. A long footbridge crosses the depot tracks, providing good views of the facility.
Morden Depot is thought to be the first such facility on the London Underground where the term "depot" was applied to a site for stabling and maintenance of trains. It was probably borrowed from army stores served by railways after the end of the First World War, which were also known as depots. Prior to this, the various underground lines all had "works" where trains were stabled and maintained. Whereas Golders Green is designated as a main depot, Morden is a subsidiary depot, despite the fact that 38 trains are stabled there, as opposed to 16 at Golders Green. The designation is based on the range of maintenance functions performed at the depot, not the number of trains, and heavy maintenance for the Northern line is only performed at Golders Green.
Rolling stock.
When first constructed, the depot was used to stable trains of 1924 and 1925 stock until the line northwards to Clapham was competed. With the 1923 stock, trains were formed into five-car units, but as the number of control trailer cars increased, they were formed into six-car units, with motor cars at the outside ends, two control trailers in the middle, and two trailer cars. The delivery of additional standard stock, 112 cars in 1926 and 306 cars in 1927, enabled all trains on the Northern line to be formed of the new air-door stock. The extra stock meant that the frequency of trains could be improved, and the trains lengthened to seven cars. A seven-car train was formed of a four-car motor-trailer-trailer-motor unit, and a three-car motor-trailer-control trailer unit, with the control trailer in the middle of the train. During off-peak hours, trains were shortened to four cars, by uncoupling the three-car unit. Approximately half of the trains had the three-car unit at the Morden end, and thus could be shortened at Morden, with the three-car unit being shunted into the depot, to be re-attached for the next peak service. Trains with the alternative formation were shortened at Edgware or Golders Green. It is unclear whether any trains of gate stock were ever stabled at the depot, as although both types of train ran on the Northern line, the earlier gate stock was only used on short workings from Golders Green and Highgate to Charing Cross, and from Euston to Tooting, but was never used in passenger service as far south as Morden.
The 1935-40 New Works Programme which London Underground initiated included the provision of new trains, and delivery of 1938 Stock began in May 1938. By November, there were 24 trains of the new stock in passenger-carrying service, and further trains were being commissioned at a rate of two per week. At the depot, 1938 Stock gradually replaced Standard Stock, which was transferred to Acton Works and overhauled to see further service on the Central line. Delivery of 1938 Stock continued into the early years of the Second World War, and by mid-1941, there were 96 seven-car trains operational on the Northern line, with 96 spare cars, so the changeover was complete. As a result of the wartime conditions, a considerable number of new cars were stored around the system, some of which had been commissioned, but some of which could not be, because they were missing parts or motors. Five unused trailer cars were listed in the depot returns for Morden, of which some if not all were non-standard cars, which were designed to run in nine-car block trains. The use of nine-car trains was abandoned at the start of the war, and they were not reintroduced. There were also ten non-driving motor cars stored somewhere on the Northern line, but their locations were not specified. In order to improve the situation on the Bakerloo line, there was a concerted attempt to assemble the spare cars into complete trains in 1943, and the five trailer cars left Morden for Acton Works to be modified to run in standard length trains. There was a serious collision of 1938 Stock at the depot on 27 July 1971, when motor car 10278 hit motor car 11159, which was stabled in the car shed on road 6. Both cars were damaged beyond repair, and formed part of the first batch of 1938 Stock to be scrapped in 1972.
From 1972, Morden Depot ceased to be the preserve of just 1938 Stock, and by 1978, there were five types of stock in use on the Northern line and stabled at the depot. As part of a major programme of updating the rolling stock on the system, the Piccadilly line was equipped with 1973 Stock. This allowed the 1956 Stock and 1959 Stock on that line to be transferred to the Northern line, and some of the 1938 Stock to be scrapped. To make up the number of trains required, 30 trains of 1972 Mark I Stock were ordered, and subsequently, a second batch of 33 trains, known as 1972 Mark II Stock, was ordered, for eventual equipping of the Jubilee line, then under construction. They operated on the Northern line from November 1973, to enable additional 1938 Stock to be scrapped, and were gradually transferred to the Bakerloo line, as more trains of 1959 Stock were displaced from the Piccadilly line. The first train of 1959 Stock arrived in November 1975, and by 1 January 1978, 56 and a half trains had been transferred. The allocation at the beginning of 1978 comprised 10.5 trains of 1938 Stock, three of 1956 Stock, 56.5 of 1958 Stock, 30 of 1972 Mark I Stock and 15 of 1972 Mark II Stock, making 115 in total, although only 95 were required from day to day. Morden Depot was used to stable 39 trains to run the passenger service at that time, with Golders Green supplying 17, and the remaining 39 being stabled at Highgate and Edgware Depots, and on sidings at High Barnet, Highgate Woods, and Golders Green.
Although all of the 1972 Mark II Stock had left the Northern line in time for the opening of the Jubilee line in May 1979, four trains returned in 1983, following service reductions on the Jubilee line. They were modified to be compatible with the Mark I Stock, and a further 14 trains arrived in 1984–1985, as they were displaced from the Jubilee line by newly built 1983 Stock. The extra trains allowed 1959 Stock to be transferred to the Bakerloo line, to replace the remaining trains of 1938 Stock. By mid-1993, there were 2.5 trains of 1956 Stock, 74.5 trains of 1959 Stock, 2.5 trains of 1962 Stock and 24.5 trains of 1972 Stock on the Northern line, making 104 trains in total. The passenger service required 82 trains, of which 38 were supplied by Morden Depot.
The return to the depot stabling a single type of stock began in mid-1998, when the first trains of 1995 Stock entered service on the Northern line, after some 18 months of commissioning problems. As they entered service, the 1956, 1959 and 1962 Stock trains were sent for scrap, and the 1972 Stock was converted to one person operation and transferred to the Bakerloo line. The last train of 1959 Stock worked on 27 January 2000, and this was also the last train to be crewed by a driver and a guard on London Underground, as all subsequent trains were one person operated. By that date, 97 of the new trains had been commissioned, sufficient to run the peak-time service which required 84 trains. The final nine trains had been delivered by 10 April 2001. Trains consist of six cars, and are composed of two three-car units, each made up of a motor car, a trailer car, and an uncoupling non-driving motor car. From the introduction of the July 2002 timetable, 91 trains were required for the peak service, of which Morden Depot supplied 38.

Yves Guiard

Yves Guiard is a French cognitive neuroscientist and researcher best known for his work in human laterality and stimulus-response compatibility in the field of human-computer interaction. He is the director of research at French National Center for Scientific Research and a member of CHI Academy since 2016. He is also an associate editor of ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (ACM TOCHI) and member of the advisory council of the International Association for the Study of Attention and Performance.
Education.
Guiard received his PhD in cognitive neuroscience from the University of Marseilles. He was elected a French Government Fellow of Churchill College from 1996 till 1997, in Cambridge, UK.
Work.
Yves Guiard's research interests span stimulus-response compatibility and the speed/accuracy of trade-off aimed movement. He has designed and tested his novel models of interaction for mobile devices. He proposed a kinematic-chain model in 1987, but the model was only found useful by HCI researchers a decade later when two-handed interaction with the devices was started being researched.
Guiard's HCI Research team at Télécom ParisTech is group is devoted to fundamental and applied research on Human Computer Interaction (HCI). They focus on representing and manipulating big data, and allowing this not only on standard computers but also on small devices – like mobile phones and tablets.
Guiard has published multiple papers regarding the usage of two-handed input while using touch screen based interfaces. His main research topics were around the ability of producing such technology and how usable it is for a given moment in time. As the time passed by, the papers focus on improving currently used designs – like gesture based input on tablets or interaction with different modules of GUI of a modern computer through touch pads.
Guiard has developed a simple model of wrist-wear (Watchit) which implemented basic gesture-based interaction with the wearable. The research surrounding that model has helped the designs and development of the modern smart wearables.
Guiard's publication about the speed/accuracy trade-off of aimed movement goes in depth of how average users interact with common devices – standard computers or mobile phones, and the possibility of developing better designs in order to increase accuracy while not affecting the speed of the input. It explains the mathematics behind common input types and how different designs affect the speed and accuracy.
Guiard is currently working on a book titled "Human Input to Computer Systems: Theories, Techniques and Technology" with William Buxton, where they explain the methods of bringing traditional design skills to interaction design, or the design of user experience.

Leslie Urquhart

John Leslie Urquhart (11 April 1874 – 13 March 1933) was a Scottish mining entrepreneur and millionaire.
Early life.
He was born on 11 April 1874 to Scottish parents, Andrew and Jean Urquhart, in Aydın, from Smyrna in the Ottoman Empire. His father was engaged in the export trade of licorice root and paste, the extract from which was widely used in the pharmaceutical and tobacco industries, as well as confectionery production.
Urquhart went to an English school in Smyrna from age 7. In 1887 the family moved to Scotland, settling at Portobello, Edinburgh. Urquhart went to school there, then in Edinburgh, and in 1890 took up an engineering apprenticeship with Crow, Harvey &amp; Co. of Glasgow, also attending evening classes at the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College. His father was at Oudjari (Ujar), now in Azerbaijan, with a business venture. He also studied chemistry under Stevenson Macadam at Edinburgh University, and in 1896 was set for a career in the oil industry. He was diverted, however, to Ujar and his father's licorice interests there, as the manager of the Oriental Trading Corporation factory there. Thomas Urquhart, his uncle and an engineer who had supervised the Gryazi–Tsaritsyn railway line in Russia, may have influenced his decision. The oil at Baku was possibly another factor: he made a trip there in 1897, and by 1898 had made good progress in the local languages.
Oilman in Baku.
In 1902 Urquhart was offered work by the Schibaieff Petroleum Company, at a time when licorice was in glut, and became a manager for them at Baku. The factory was sold and the Oriental Trading Corporation wound up in 1903, as the American Liquorice Trust sought to create a cartel. British capital was at this point prominent in the Baku oilfields, with at least five companies buying in from 1896. There was some notable sharp practice in deals.
The dealings of George Tweedy, in particular, for Baku-Russian Petroleum, brought Charles Leslie, a director of the company, to Baku in 1904. He struck up a friendship with Urquhart. When he was forced to leave the oil business, two years later, Urquhart was able to set up the Anglo-Siberian Company in London, for mining, by combining his contacts with Leslie's.
The change was precipitated by political events, starting with a wave of strikes in Baku, and the fall of Sergei Witte, in 1903. It was followed by the Russo-Japanese War, and communal violence between Armenians and Tatars in Baku during February 1905. In private, Urquhart, who employed Tatars and spoke their language, entirely took their side. The disturbances of the 1905 Russian Revolution that took place in Baku in September of that year were particularly bloody. Urquhart was awarded an Albert Medal for Lifesaving, the citation noting his position as British Vice-Consul in Baku, and his actions to save four British workmen in September 1905, with Tatar and Cossack support.
After a complex series of events and negotiations, Urquhart left revolutionary Baku on instructions from the British Foreign office and companies, reaching Moscow on 25 September. His life was said to be in danger, but he was also much criticised.
Kyshtym.
Urquhart's setting up of the Anglo-Siberian Corporation then led to other vehicles for capital. The Perm Corporation was likewise intended to exploit minerals in the Urals, and Anglo-Siberian took it over in 1908, once it had acquired the Kyshtym Mining Works of 1900, a Russian company. The Kyshtym Corporation Ltd. then bought the shares from the Perm Corporation. Exploratory surveys at Kyshtym for Anglo-Siberian had confirmed the presence of deposits of copper, iron and sulphur; and gold in the Soymonovsk Valley. The result was that the mineral resources of the Kyshtym estate were controlled by a board chaired by Charles Leslie, on which Urquhart sat. In autumn 1908 Urquhart and Semmy Joseph Blumlein, managing director, went to Kyshtym and supervised investment, including rail track and a smelter.
The complex corporate situation proved unstable, because of tensions between British interests related by cross-holdings. American interests became involved. In 1911 Alfred Chester Beatty visited Kyshtym, on behalf of the American interests. By 1912 the future direction was set for investment in the Urals, with Beatty and Urquhart allied, and the British group around Leslie excluded.
At this period, Urquhart also acquired interests in what is now Kazakhstan. They were in lead and zinc at Ridder, and coal at Ekibastuz. He chaired the Irtysh Corporation, which held the Kirgiz Coal Mining Company, the owner of the mines. The Irtysh Corporation, in turn, was financed by the Russo-Asiatic Corporation, a British company of which Urquhart was a director. It had been set up in 1912, when it was partly owned by Anglo-Siberian, with two banks; but Anglo-Siberian was wound up shortly after that. Other holdings were at Tanalyk in Orenburg Oblast. They produced copper, and Baron Meller-Zakomelsky, whose family estate was at Kyshtym, invited Urquhart to become a partner in the venture, around 1911.
Aftermath of the Russian Revolution.
A consequence of the 1917 Russian Revolution was the nationalisation of mining interests in the former Russian Empire. Urquhart in 1921 became President of the Association of British Creditors of Russia (ABC of Russia), a broad-based pressure group. His personal objective was to secure for Russo-Asiatic a concession to run again the corporation's mining sites, under the new regime. The Hands Off Russia campaign by the British Left had little purchase, but the Lloyd George administration was keen to trade with the Soviet Union.
Urquhart was a strong opponent of the Bolsheviks, and as a backer of Alexander Kolchak an advocate of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. Under Sir Charles Eliot, British Commissioner in Siberia, he ran through staff the Siberian Supply Company that operated in 1918–9 behind the White Russian lines, but no further west than Harbin.
A 1921 agreement made by Urquhart with Leonid Krasin fell through, undermined by a public attack by Urquhart on the Cheka, and Lenin's wish to make an anti-British gesture. By the time of the Genoa Conference (1922), however, Urquhart had come to favour a more co-operative attitude to the Soviet Union. His dealings, however, were caught up with the international tensions caused by the events around the Armistice of Mudanya in October 1922. The Soviets were snubbed by a virtual exclusion from the subsequent Conference of Lausanne. Arthur Ransome argued that their assumption that treating Urquhart harshly would affect the British government was based on faulty reasoning.
During the New Economic Policy period, Urquhart persisted in efforts to secure concessions in the territory of the USSR. Lenin's view of 1922 was the Ekibastuz site should not be wholly granted as a concession to Urquhart. By 1925 there was local resistance, for example in the Kazakh Republic by Nikolai Yezhov. Urquhart's approach to dealing with the Soviet concessions, and Georgy Pyatakov who controlled them, on behalf of the Russo-Asiatic Consolidated group, contrasted with the subtler and more accommodating tactics employed by Herbert Guedalla and Grigori Benenson for the Imperial and Foreign Corporation, also based in London. They gained control of Lena Goldfields, by business manipulations, and had a much freer hand in the USSR. Urquhart shunned chances to ally with them.
Urquhart attempted, through Midian Ltd., to exploit sites formerly in the Ottoman Empire, to the south of the Dead Sea; but the British government favoured the interests of the Turkish Petroleum Company.
Later life.
In the later 1920s Urquhart was heavily involved in the Mount Isa Mines (MIM) of Queensland in Australia. He repeated there a pattern of local development of towns that he had carried out in pre-war Russia. The Urquhart Shale ore body is named for him. The Australian mining consultant William Henry Corbould, who had worked at Mount Isa, went on in 1928 to survey Edie Creek in the Territory of New Guinea, for Urquhart and the Ellyou Goldfields Development Corporation. There resulted the New Guinea Goldfields Ltd. subsidiary of MIM.
Urquhart died in London on 13 March 1933.
Awards and honours.
Urquhart received the Russian imperial Order of Saint Stanislaus, 2nd class with star, in 1916.
Family.
Urquhart married American-born Beryl da Silva-Bald in 1909; her father was English, her mother from Illinois. The wedding was in London, but the couple went then to Kyshtym, where their first son Kenneth was born the following year.

Steinernematidae

The 
Steinernematidae are a family of nematodes in the order Rhabditida.
Nematodes of the genus "Sterinernema" are obligate insect parasites that inhabit soil. "Xenorhabdus" bacteria occupy nematode insecticide and synergistically kill, digest, and consume insect hosts.
Together with "Heterorhabditis", "Caenorhabditis", "Rhabditis", "Pelodera", "Strongyloides", "Bursilla", "Cruznema", and "Panagrellus", "Sterinernema" belongs to the order Rhabditida.

Automobile graveyard

An automobile graveyard or car cemetery is a place in which road vehicles reside while waiting to be destroyed or recycled or are left abandoned and decaying.
Locations and purposes.
There are numerous automobile graveyards that can be found around the world. The purpose of each location varies. Just outside Victorville, California there are hundreds of thousands of cars that were bought back by Volkswagen after the 2015 emissions scandal and they are awaiting recycling or destruction. Some cemeteries operate in a manner similar to scrapyards where rare spare parts can be found. The Historischer Autofriedhof Gürbetal in Kaufdorf comprised hundreds of cars, mostly from the 1930s to 1960s. The cars went untouched for more than 30 years. They were collected with the hope of salvaging useful and rare parts. However, time and nature led to the vehicles' decay. Overgrown with rare flora and fauna, the site had to be cleared when environmental concerns were raised in 2009.
Sites containing such cemeteries can become public attractions. In the U.S. state of Georgia, Wade Alonso's Auto Parts &amp; Wrecker Service is colloquially known as "The School Bus Graveyard". Looking for a way to reduce theft from his property, Alonso built a large wall using school buses and RVs. Many of the state's artists came to paint the sides of the buses, creating a colourful and unusual art gallery around which people are freely welcome to wander. Also in Georgia is Old Car City USA, world's largest car junkyard, a site which began in 1931 as a car dealership but now serves as a 6-mile trail for visitors to discover over 4,000 cars. While many automobile graveyards are easily accessible, others are much less welcoming. In 2016 urban explorers found a "mountain of vehicles" in an abandoned Welsh mine. The cars were piled up at the bottom of the slate mine and are believed to have been there since the 1970s. Such sites can also be popular amongst photographers.
Some automobile cemeteries do not contain civilian vehicles such as cars and motorbikes, but specialized vehicles instead. French authorities set up a warehouse to help preserve firefighting history, storing fire engines that date back to the early 20th century. The vehicles, though covered in dust, were protected from the elements, but after an urban explorer published photographs of the site they were all moved to a new, secret location. There are also sites with numerous armoured vehicles, sometimes referred to as a tank graveyard. Another notable specialized vehicles graveyard is the race car graveyard located in North Carolina owned by NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr., which became the final resting place for cars such as Juan Pablo Montoya's 2012 Daytona 500 car that collided with a jet dryer during the race.

Jean Delespine

Jean Delespine or Jean de l'Espine (1505–1576), was a French angevin architect of the Renaissance.
Biography.
Jean Delespine was a renowned architect. The Renaissance in Anjou owes much to the artistic and architectural production of this master builder. Today he is attributed about forty works, almost all located in the former province of Anjou.
Jean Delespine was, at his beginnings, the student of Jean Mariau, an architect in Angers, to whom he succeeded, in 1535, as "Commissaire des œuvres et réparations de la ville" of Angers. 
Delespine was in charge of important urban developments. He worked under the direction of a succession of mayors, including , and .
His official functions were at the origin of contacts with the Controller General of the Bâtiments de France, Philibert Delorme, a great Renaissance architect, (Palais des Tuileries, Château d'Anet) attached to Anjou as commendatory abbot of the .
In 1571, Delespine ceased his duties as curator of the city's works.
In 1576, he died in his home of the rue Beaurepaire in Angers. His body lies in the church next to the Carmelite convent. His tomb bore an epitaph to the glory of his architectural talents: "... mais qui n’admireroit ta hardie entreprise" / "de ta brave lanterne au pignon de l’église" / "posée en l’air si hault entre deux piramides" / "dont les poincts eslevez touchent aux nues liquides" / ...
 also reports some extracts of this epitaph: "On cognoist l'arbre au fruit, l'ouvrier à l'ouvrage" / "les tiens portent assez, L'Espine, tesmoignage" / "De l'excellent esprit dont Dieu t'avoit pourveu" / "quand parmi les plus grands en crédit on téa veu".

Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity.
Iris Angola, the country's only gay rights lobby group established in 2013, was given legal status in June. Due to the lack of recognition by the state governments, members of this group had faced discrimination accessing health and education services. This "historic moment" allowed homosexuality rights to be defended in Angola.
Treatment of Migrants.
Over 400,000 Congolese migrants were expelled from Angola in October. President Lourenço claimed this was to reduce diamond smuggling, but was backed up with nonexistent evidence.

The bay is part of the larger, enclosed water of Port Foster. It was named "Bahia 1 de Mayo" or "Bahia Primero de Mayo" by the Argentine Antarctic Expedition of 1942–43, after the "1 de Mayo", an expedition ship which visited Deception Island in 1942 and 1943; she sank off the coast of Argentina on 5 February 1944.
The Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey carried out a full survey in 1953-54. Aerial photography was carried out by the Falkland Islands and Dependencies Aerial Survey Expedition of 1956-57. After this, the bay was named 'Fumarole Bay' because the most active fumarole on the island is situated here.
Fumaroles at the bay are in the temperature range of 100-107°C.

Bewsey Old Hall

Bewsey Old Hall is a brick built, three storey, mainly Jacobean building, incorporating or reusing elements of a former medieval hall situated on the edge of Sankey Valley Park in Warrington, Cheshire. Bewsey Old Hall and estate was home to the Lords of Warrington from the thirteenth to the seventeenth century.
The name 'Bewsey' is believed to have been derived from the French 'Beau Se', or 'is beautiful' and likely refers to the hall's position on the edge of Burton Wood, next to Sankey Brook
History.
Sir William Fitz Almeric Le Boteler, Lord of Warrington built Bewsey Old Hall following the destruction by fire of his original house, which was located nearer the current town centre on the Mote Hill (near to the site of the current parish church, St Elphins). The date of the fire is not recorded exactly, but is believed to be between the years 1256 and 1259. In order to build the house, Boteler obtained lands in Burton Wood from his feudal Lord, Earl Ferrar in 1260 and from Prince Edmund in 1270. A monastic grange, owned by the monks of Titley Abbey, in Essex, previously occupied the site. The first hall, a single storey wooden medieval hall, of which nothing now remains was replaced by a brick building in the 16th century.
Thomas Boteler, the founder of Sir Thomas Boteler Church of England High School was born at Bewsey Old Hall in 1461. In 1463, his father Sir John FitzJohn le Boteler was murdered and Thomas's elder brother, William, inherited the estates. William died at the age of 22, fighting in the Lancastrian ranks at the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471 and Thomas inherited the estates and was knighted in 1504. He died at Bewsey Old Hall on 27 April 1522 and was buried in the Boteler chapel of the St. Elphin's Church.
Bewsey Old Hall passed to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester in 1586 in settlement of gambling debts when Edward Boteler died without an heir. Dudley sold the estate to lawyer Thomas Ireland, of Childwall, and the house remained in the possession of the Ireland family for six generations until 1675. Sir Thomas was knighted at Bewsey by King James I in 1617, the king later stayed the night at Bewsey. Sir Thomas Ireland was father in law of Gilbert Ireland.
Bewsey was inherited by Richard Atherton, although it was not his main home, with relatively nearby Atherton Hall, Leigh being his primary residence. In the mid eighteenth century the Atherton’s added a new wing to the building. Legend states that the Stuart prince Bonnie Prince Charlie stayed the night there, on his retreat from Derby during the Jacobite rising of 1745.
The house passed by marriage to the Lilford family in 1797, when the Atherton estate was inherited by Thomas Powys, Lord Lilford, who preferred to live at the family seat, Lilford Hall in Northamptonshire. The Lilfords also inherited Atherton Hall, however, they considered one property in Lancashire adequate for their needs and lavished considerable expense on Bewsey Hall. After failing to sell Atherton Hall which was less than a century old, it was demolished in 1824, with some of the furniture and carpets being sent to Bewsey. They later demolished the eighteenth century wing and in 1860-61 a new half-timbered house (Bewsey New Hall) was built on a different site west of Camp Road for Thomas Powys, 4th Baron Lilford as a replacement for the Old Hall, with the original hall being converted into two farmhouses and let to tenants. The new building was almost certainly designed by W.G. Habershon, but Lady Lilford disliked the house so much that she refused to live in it and it was largely demolished in the 1940s, apart from a fragment of the west wing.
Building and grounds.
The original fourteenth century moat only partly holds water today. The building has distinctive chimneystacks and stone mullion windows which are most likely the work of Sir Thomas Ireland and date back to around 1600. Bewsey's remaining medieval structures were demolished during the eighteenth century, when the hall was extended, and landscaping works filled in parts of the moat and enlarged others as water features. In 1863, a 'New Hall' was built, and Bewsey Old Hall was left in the hands of tenants, until, in considerable disrepair, it was acquired by Warrington Development Corporation in 1974.
Notable events.
Sir John Boteler, Lord of Warrington, was murdered in his bed in 1521 at Bewsey Hall, the murderers allegedly acting on the orders of his brother-in-law, Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby, with whom he had been on bad terms for some time. Sir Piers Legh and Sir William Savage, whom Stanley had employed to carry out the deed, bribed the porter at Bewsey to place a lighted taper in a certain window when the house had settled down for the evening. They then crossed the moat in a coracle like boat and stole into Sir John's bed chamber, a struggle with the chamberlain ensued who was also murdered. They later hung the treacherous servant from a tree in the Bewsey estate, so that he could not give evidence against them.
Legend has it that the Bonnie Prince Charlie stayed the night there, on his retreat from Derby during the 1745 campaign.
Recent history.
Warrington New Town Development Corporation purchased the house from Lord Lilford in 1974. In September, 2011, the hall was subject to an arson attack, and lost part of its roof. Despite local campaigns against it, a public inquiry, held in May and September 2011 granted permission for seven flats to be built in the Grade II* listed hall. Development Company 'Next Big Thing' have now redeveloped the property into a number of apartments

Hemel Hempstead Hospital

Hemel Hempstead Hospital is an acute District General Hospital in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire operated by the West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust.
History.
The original hospital in Hemel Hempstead was established when Sir Astley Cooper converted a row of cottages at 130–136 Piccotts End to create an infirmary in 1827. The medical team moved to larger premises, acquired with funding from Sir John Sebright, 7th Baronet, at Cheere House at the bottom of Hillfield Road in 1832. The main block of the current hospital, then known as the West Hertfordshire Infirmary, was built further up Hillfield Road and was opened by Princess Mary of Teck in 1877. The hospital expanded to take military patients during the First World War.
The Marnham Maternity Wing, which was started in 1926 when a foundation stone was laid by the Prince of Wales just north of the main block, opened in 1929. A children's ward was added in 1939 and another new block was opened by the Queen Mother in 1959.
The Verulam Wing, at the south-east end of the site, was added in 1992, the Jubilee Wing, just south of the main block, followed in 2002 and major enhancements consisting of an urgent care centre and a GP-led health centre were introduced within the Jubilee Wing in October 2008 and spring 2009 respectively.
Services.
Most departments are located in the Verulam Wing; however the urgent care centre and the health centre form part of the Jubilee Wing.
Controversy.
Large parts of the hospital site are currently mothballed and not actively used for healthcare provision, following the removal of the Accident &amp; Emergency department in 2006. The West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, which operates the site and two others in Watford and St Albans, has announced plans to redevelop its properties and relocate key services to Watford General Hospital, in effect further downgrading the status of the Hemel Hempstead Hospital. However, these plans have attracted criticism from local residents groups, such as the Dacorum Hospital Action Group, who favour a newly built hospital equidistant from the three major population centres and who have launched a judicial review of the Trust's plan.

NGC 3199

NGC 3199 is an emission nebula in the constellation Carina. It is commonly known as the Banana Nebula. The object was discovered in 1826 by the Scottish astronomer James Dunlop. It is a bow shock around the central star, WR 18, an especially hot and especially luminous Wolf–Rayet star.
the bright edge was thought to indicate a bow shock produced as the star plowed through a uniform medium, like a boat through water. But measurements have shown the star is not really moving directly toward the bright edge. So a more likely explanation is that the material surrounding the star is not uniform, but clumped and denser near the bright edge of NGC 3199.[FROM ASTRONOMY PIC OF THE DAY 2021 May 6]

Britney Hamada

, known professionally as is a Japanese manga artist and "tarento". Affiliated with Ever Green Entertainment, she founded Piece Eight Co. Ltd. She appeared as a judge at the World Cosplay Summit 2009
Early life and career.
Britney Hamada was born in Chiba, Chiba as Hamada Sugako. She took her professional from Sugawara no Michizane. Her father is from Kyushu and she has an elder brother and a mother and is married.
After graduating from high school she went to a vocational school with the aim of becoming a trimmer, but as the commute took more than four hours from her parents' house, she got tired of it (she said that she is a "petit runaway"). After graduating from the vocational school, she read the manga "Manga Michi" depicting the half-life of Fujiko Fujio A, and was impressed. She entered the professional training course at the Nihon Manga Juku Daytime Department in April 2005.
Half a year after entering Japanese Manga Juku, Hamada's work was selected for the school's Best Work Award. Hamada brought in the editorial department of Big Comic Spirits. While listening to her story, an interested editor suggested that she try to draw about herself, and she decided to draw a "gyaru" manga.
Manga artist activities.
Her pen name was inspired by Britney Spears. In addition, Harada also considered "Hilton Hamada," "Beyonce Hamada," and the like as candidates for her pen name.
In 2006, she debuted at Big Comic Spirits Casual in "Hyper Tantei Rinka". The style of her work was evaluated, and she hired as an assistant to Hanayo Hanatsu.
In July 2007, Big Comic Spirits began serialising "Pagyaru!," depicting the ecology of gyaru in Shibuya using gyaru words. After that, "Britney's life counselings," was added, which answers reader's questions in dialogue form with her editor-in-charge.
In March 2008, Harada held talks with Fujiko Fujio A and Tetsuya Chiba at Big Comic Spirits No. 18 and participated in the gravure page of the model Tsubasa Masuwaka.
Personal life.
&lt;includeonly&gt;Please don't delete this article because this section, which looks like it is from a fan page and has unnecessary information, is actually from the person's Japanese article.&lt;/includeonly&gt;
As a "homeless "gyaru" manga artist", she lived a life to live in manga cafes or karaoke boxes without a permanent place to say. She said that she had paid a pension. She ended her "homeless life" at the end of 2009 and lived in a Tokyo condominium with a six-tatami room and a Loft store. Hamada and her editor meet exclusively at a karaoke box in Shibuya.
Her father was very tough and hit Hamada if she dyed her hair, and threw out her hair dye. Her parents found out that she became a manga artist for the first time only when seeing her works sold. Although she stayed unhappy with her father after she ran away from home, he saved clippings of the magazines she was in. Her relationship with her parents improved, and she gave them a car and her mother a smartphone.
On 25 October 2010, on her former official website, she quit Ever Green Entertainment, to which she belonged since December 2008, and announced that she was devoting herself to manga. She later launched Piece Eight Co., Ltd., a private company. On 2 November 2010, she closed her former official website and blog, opening a new official website and blog the next day. On 1 October 2011, Harada announced that she would continue her entertainment activities on her own blog.
She announced her engagement in December 2013, but broke it off in June 2014. In February 2018 she announced that her actual age was 38, and that she was pregnant with her first child, making a decision to give birth as a single mother.
She's also knowledgeable about video games, and her 2018 game specialty book has a review of the "kusoge" genre. That book cites "" as her personal PlayStation "kusoge" ranking first place.
Reception.
Mimi Usagino of Techinsight Japan's editorial department says that Hamada's bold style of drawing the ecology of contemporary young women resembles Yutsuko Chusonji's work. There are flashy clothes and makeup from Ado Mizumori, so it is said that Hamada's characters will not feel new. In addition, Usagino says that Hamada is expressing her body with messages such as, "there is no house in such a dark era, there are young people who are enjoying living happily." Her entertainment profile as a celebrity is cheerful, flashy and slightly "obaka" but bright. characters who are called "Manga+"Tarento"", on the other hand, have many rivals.

In 2011 he produced "Ain't Misbehavin"' musical directed by Richard Maltby and within 2 years toured Turkey, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, Spain, Israel, and Hungary.
In 2013, Klein started to work with the Spanish contemporary flamenco dance company "Los Vivancos" taking its "Aeternum" show with the Hungarian all-female band "Maszka Band" to London and Budapest. He also arranged "Los Vivancos" performance at the Beijing 2014 BTV Global Spring Festival TV show.

In 2017 Klein brought the winners of Hungarian "Virtuosi" show to New York's Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall.
Porgy and Bess.
Peter Klein started to consider staging his own production of "Porgy and Bess" in 1991 when his Argentinian colleague asked him to bring the opera to Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires. In 1992 he brought the existing production of the Virginia Opera company to an 18-performance tour of Latin America in April and May, with 9 performances at Teatro Colon. Klein’s own production started touring US and Canada in January 1993. In the 90s it was also known as the "Charleston production" as it debuted in Charleston and performed with the Charleston Symphony Orchestra (David Stahl, conductor).
The concept of the touring production was approved by George Gershwin’s heirs. Leopold Godowsky III, the nephew of George Gershwin, helped Klein to develop the concept of the touring version with shorter performance time and reduced number of musicians. The original cast had three pairs of lead actors: Brian Gibson and Elizabeth Graham, Andre Solomon-Glover and Vanessa Stewart, William Marshall and Claudette McCargo.
Peter Klein’s Living Arts production of "Porgy and Bess" was presented in 23 countries including the UK (1997, 1999), Australia and New Zealand (1997, 2006), Egypt (2000), China (2001), Portugal (2003) and Estonia (2008). It has toured the US multiple times.

Pillion was a bay mare bred and owned by Anthony Gustav de Rothschild. She was set into training with John Watson at the Palace House stable in Newmarket in Suffolk.
Her sire Chaucer won the Gimcrack Stakes as a juvenile in 1902, and later proved himself a high-class performer in handicap races. As a breeding stallion he sired the 1000 Guineas winner Canyon and was the damsire of Fairway, Hyperion, Pharos and Sickle. Pillion's dam Double Back also produced the Coventry Stakes winner Reflector and was a descendant of the influential broodmare Sunray.
Racing career.
1925: two-year-old season.
In 1925 Pillion recorded her only win from five starts at Nottingham Racecourse in summer when she won the £1,000 Nottinghamshire Breeders' Foal Plate. In the Rous Memorial Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in July she ran well but was no match for the colt Coronach. In October, Pillion finished second to Karra in the Cheveley Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. In her two other races that year the filly finished second in the Houghton Stakes and ran fourth in the Champion Breeders' Foal Stakes at Derby.
In the Free Handicap, ranking of the year's best two-year-olds, Pillion was placed in joint 24th place, fourteen pounds behind the top-rated Colorado.
1926: three-year-old season.
On 30 April Pillion, ridden by Dick Perryman, started a 25/1 outsider in a twenty-nine runner field for the 113th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse. Karra started favourite but made no impact as Pillion went to the front a quarter of a mile from the finish and won "nicely" by a length from Trilogy with half a length back to Short Story in third.
In the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse a month later Pillion started 11/2 second favourite but after disputing the lead until the final turn she tired in the last quarter mile and finished fifth of the sixteen runners behind Short Story. Later that year, the filly reportedly won the Stewards Handicap at Nottingham.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Pillion an "inferior" winner of the 1000 Guineas.
Breeding record.
At the end of her racing career, Pillion was retired to become a broodmare. She produced at least two foals between 1932 and 1938:

In the Dark (American TV series)

In the Dark is an American crime drama television series, created by Corinne Kingsbury for The CW, which debuted as a mid-season entry during the 2018–19 television season. On January 30, 2018, The CW ordered the show to pilot, with Michael Showalter set to direct. In May 2018, the show received a series order. The series premiered on April 4, 2019. In April 2019, the series was renewed for a second season that premiered on April 16, 2020. In January 2020, The CW renewed the series for a third season which premiered on June 23, 2021. In February 2021, the series was renewed for a fourth season.
Premise.
An irreverent blind woman in her twenties, Murphy, drifts through life in a drunken haze. She has only two friends—Jess, her understanding roommate, and Tyson, a teenage drug-dealer who saved her from a violent mugging. Out for a walk with her guide dog, Pretzel, she stumbles upon a corpse that must be Tyson's, but it disappears before the police arrive. When they do not seem inclined to investigate, Murphy clings onto the only thing that can keep her together: figuring out what happened to her friend. She resolves to solve the murder herself, while also managing her colorful dating life and the job she hates at "Guiding Hope", a school run by her parents for training guide dogs.
Production.
Development.
The series was created by Corinne Kingsbury for The CW, to debut during the 2018–19 television season. On January 30, 2018, The CW officially ordered the pilot. The series was greenlit on May 11, 2018.
"In the Dark" is the first CW primetime series to carry Descriptive Video Service audio, though The CW, as a minor network, is not required to have any DVS provisions under the regulations for audio description for their affiliates, so the base of stations carrying that track is smaller than other networks where carriage of descriptive video is required. On January 10, 2019, The CW announced the premiere of the series on April 4 at 9 p.m. On April 24, 2019, The CW renewed the series for a second season, that was originally scheduled to premiere on May 28, 2020, however it was moved to premiere date on April 16, 2020. On January 7, 2020, the series was renewed for a third season which premiered on June 23, 2021. On February 3, 2021, The CW renewed the series for a fourth season.
Casting.
On March 2, 2018, it was announced that Perry Mattfeld had been cast in the protagonist role of Murphy in the series' pilot, along with Brooke Markham as Jess, Murphy's roommate and best friend, and Keston John as Darnell, a local drug dealer; followed on March 9 with Kathleen York as Joy, Murphy's mother, and Derek Webster as Hank, Joy's husband. Austin Nichols was cast as Dean, a cop with a blind daughter, on March 12. On May 16, 2018, The CW announced that the role of Dean had been recast; with Nichols thereafter replaced by Rich Sommer on July 13, 2018. On September 10, 2019, Matt Murray was cast in a recurring role for the second season.
The show received some criticism for casting a sighted actor to play a blind character. British actor James Moore, who plays a disabled character in the soap opera "Emmerdale" and has a disability himself, argued that disabled actors will always be better placed to play disabled roles due to their life experience. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, critics worried that the "questionable treatment of physical handicaps may leave some viewers with a dim impression." During a panel discussion at the Television Critics Association press tour, executive producer Nicky Weinstock defended the choices, claiming that they initially auditioned blind actors, but ultimately cast Perry because she was the best actor for the role.
Filming.
Filming on the pilot began on March 12, 2018, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; and wrapped on March 28. Principal photography on season 1 began on August 8, 2018, and ended on December 21, 2018. Principal photography for the second season began on August 19, 2019 and ended on January 24, 2020 in Toronto and Cambridge, Ontario, Canada. Filming for the series' third season began on November 2, 2020 and concluded on April 21, 2021.
Broadcast.
"In the Dark" premiered on The CW at 9:00 p.m. on April 4, 2019.
In Canada, the series premiered on April 4, 2019 on Bravo!. The series continues to be broadcast on the channel, which is now branded as CTV Drama Channel. In fall 2020, the second season was re-run on CTV 2 starting September 15.
In the Philippines, aired on GTV this 2022.
Reception.
Critical response.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an approval rating of 73% based on 15 reviews, with an average rating of 7.16/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Perry Mattfield is compelling as an amateur sleuth "In the Dark", although the series' recycling of mystery tropes and questionable treatment of physical handicaps may leave some viewers with a dim impression." On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".

HMS Shoreham (L32)

HMS "Shoreham" was the lead ship of the of sloops built for the British Royal Navy. Completed in 1931, "Shoreham" served pre-war in the Persian Gulf. In the Second World War she served in the Gulf and Red Sea, the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. She survived the war and was sold for commercial use in 1946 and was scrapped in 1950.
Construction and design.
The British Admiralty ordered four sloops of the new as part of the 1929 construction programme, with two each ordered from Devonport and Chatham dockyards. They were an improved version of the of the 1928 programme, which were themselves a modification of the . They were intended for a dual role of patrol service in overseas stations in peacetime and minesweeping during war.
"Shoreham" was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was standard. Two Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers fed two geared steam turbines which drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of .
The ship's main gun armament consisted of two 4-inch (102 mm) QF Mk V guns mounted fore-and-aft on the ship's centreline, with the forward gun on a High-Angle (HA) anti-aircraft mounting and the aft gun on a Low-Angle (LA) mounting, suitable only for use against surface targets. Four 3-pounder saluting guns completed the ship's gun armament. The initial anti-submarine armament consisted of four depth charges.
"Shoreham" was ordered on 23 September 1929 and was laid down at Chatham on 19 December 1929. She was launched on 22 November 1930 and completed on 2 November 1931.
Modifications.
One of "Shoreham"s 4-inch guns was removed in 1933, but was reinstated in 1934. In 1938, "Shoreham"s anti-aircraft armament was improved by replacing the aft 4-inch gun by a similar gun on a HA mounting, while a quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun mount was fitted for close-in anti-aircraft duties. During the Second World War, the ship's 3-pounder saluting guns were removed to accommodate more useful armament. The ship's anti aircraft armament was gradually increased, first by fitted a second quadruple machine gun mount, and then by the addition of Oerlikon 20 mm cannons and finally a 2-pounder "pom-pom" anti-aircraft gun, giving an ultimate anti-aircraft outfit of three Oerlikons and one 2-pounder. One 3-pounder saluting gun was re-instated after the war, when "Shoreham" returned to the Gulf.
The ship's anti-submarine armament was also gradually increased during the war, with the number of depth charges carried increasing from 15 to as many as 60–90. Other wartime changes included the fitting of radar and HF/DF radio direction-finding gear.
Service.
On commissioning, "Shoreham" was deployed to the Persian Gulf, where she served continuously, except for refits, until the outbreak of the Second World War. She was refitted at Colombo in Ceylon in October 1932, and at Bombay in 1933, 1934 and 1938. In January 1939, "Shoreham" was refitted and rearmed at Malta, before returning to the Gulf.
The outbreak of war saw "Shoreham" continue to be based in the Gulf, patrolling and checking shipping for contraband. In May 1940 the ship transferred to the Red Sea. Italy's declaration of war on 10 June 1940 brought Royal Navy forces in the Red Sea into conflict with the Italian Red Sea Flotilla. On 18 June 1940 the Italian submarine was spotted off Aden by a patrolling aircraft and attacked unsuccessfully by two RAF bombers. "Shoreham" and the destroyer were sent out to intercept, but a depth charge attack by "Khandahar" was unsuccessful and the submarine escaped. On 23 June 1940, "Shoreham", together with the destroyers "Khandahar", and encountered the Italian submarine off Perim Island. A gun duel between the British ships and "Torricelli" took place in which both "Shoreham" and "Khartoum" were hit by shells from the Italian submarine and "Toricelli" was sunk. Several hours later, "Khartoum" was sunk when a fire resulting from the action caused one of her magazines to explode. On 3 August 1940, Italy invaded British Somaliland. The British position soon became untenable, and it was decided to evacuate the British troops from the port of Berbera. The evacuation began on 14 August, with "Shoreham" taking part in the evacuation. In total, 7140 people were evacuated to Aden by the time the evacuation ended on 19 August.
On 23 May 1941, "Shoreham" intercepted the German merchant ship "Oder", which had left Massawa earlier that day, near Perim. "Oder" scuttled herself. "Shoreham" was refitted in Bombay in April–May 1941, after which she moved back to the Persian Gulf. On 25 August 1941 Britain and the Soviet Union invaded Iran. "Shoreham" was assigned to the attack on Abadan, covering the landing of the 24th Indian Infantry Brigade which was tasked with taking the oil refineries in the city. The landings took the Iranians by surprise, and "Shoreham" sank the which was berthed in the port. After the invasion was completed "Shoreham" returned to the Red Sea, serving as anti-aircraft guard ship at Suez, and in January 1942 transferred to the Eastern Fleet, based at Colombo. "Shoreham" was refitted at Bombay from October 1942 to February 1943 and then moved to the Mediterranean, joining the Levant Command.
On 10 July 1943 "Shoreham" was part of the naval force supporting Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. In September 1943 "Shoreham" returned to the Eastern fleet, escorting convoys off the West coast of India. From March to June 1944 "Shoreham" was refitted at Cape Town and then returned to the Eastern Fleet, where she was employed on convoy escort of the East coast of India. On 2 January 1945, "Shoreham" took part in Operation Lightning, landing of British and Indian troops on the Akyab peninsular, with "Shoreham" helping to land troops of the 3rd Commando Brigade. She was refitted at Durban in April 1945, then returned to her escort duties, which continued until the end of the war.
After the end of the war, "Shoreham" was transferred to the Persian Gulf, where she served until July 1946. She then returned to Britain for the first time since her commissioning, and was laid up for disposal. "Shoreham" was sold on 4 November 1946 for commercial service, and was renamed "Jorge F El Joven". She was scrapped at Zeebrugge from November 1950.

Tracey Rogers

Tracey Rogers is a marine ecologist at the University of New South Wales who studies how mammals survive changing environments.
Early life and education.
As a child, Rogers was interested in deadly sea creatures. Rogers became interested in leopard seals whilst working as a seal trainer at Taronga Zoo. The call of Astrid, a giant female leopard seal, inspired Rogers to pursue a career in research. Rogers completed her PhD, "Acoustic behaviour of the leopard seal, Hydrurga leptonyx : physical characteristics and functional significance", in 1997 at the University of Sydney.
Research.
Rogers has served as Director of the Australian Marine Mammal Research Centre. She joined the University of New South Wales in 2008. Her lab at the University of New South Wales study mammals, in particular the leopard seal (an Antarctic apex predator), and their response to changing environments. To do this, she studies changes in the seals' diet and habits over time. She identified that if mother seals stay with their pups, father seals only use simple, crude calls, whereas if mothers are more adventurous, the language becomes more complex. She also found that female leopard seals can also sing during breeding season, which is rare in the animal world. She believes that leopard seals might use the high-frequency (165 kHz) to echolocate food during dark winters. She identified that more juvenile seals stayed together, where as older, more dominant seals have more established territories.
She studies seals at the Commonwealth Bay and Prydz Bay. The seals are tricky to study as they live in dangerous pack ice off coastal Antarctica, making observations difficult. To identify how the seals respond to a changing ecosystem, Rogers studies them using acoustic technology (hydrophones and retired military sonar buoys). During expeditions, the team take biopsies and collect fur from seals in the wild, which can be used as biomarkers to "capture the changes in an individual's diet, environment, climate, health, and stress levels". These can be compared to seals in museum collections, collected by Douglas Mawson and Ernest Shackleton, to work out how changes in the ecosystem impact the food chain. By understanding how climate change impacts species in the Antarctic, they can predict how they will cope with changes in the future. She is now considered the word-expert in leopard seals. She has also studied the composition of Whale mucus with the Sydney Institute of Marine Science.
She was awarded the Australian Institute of Policy and Science Young Tall Poppy Science Researcher prize in 2005, and became the Tall Poppy ambassador in 2009. The children at Castle Cove Primary School were so inspired by her seal research they wanted to contribute, and raised money for a satellite tracker off the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Rogers named one of the seals they observed Milo, after a school mascot, and the class tracked it in the ocean for 12 months.
Rogers contributes to The Conversation, National Geographic and Nature. She appeared on The Life Scientific in September 2017.

Kingdom of Greece

The Kingdom of Greece ( ) was established in 1832 and was the successor state to the First Hellenic Republic. It was internationally recognised by the Treaty of Constantinople, where Greece also secured its full independence from the Ottoman Empire after nearly four centuries.
The Kingdom of Greece was dissolved in 1924 and the Second Hellenic Republic was established following Greece's defeat by Turkey in the Asia Minor Campaign. A military "coup d'état" restored the monarchy in 1935 and Greece became a Kingdom again until 1973. The Kingdom was finally dissolved in the aftermath of a seven-year military dictatorship (1967–1974) and the Third Hellenic Republic was established following a referendum held in 1974.
Background.
The Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire, also known as Byzantine Empire, which ruled most of the Eastern Mediterranean region for over 1100 years, had been fatally weakened since the sacking of Constantinople by the Latin Crusaders in 1204.
The Ottomans captured Constantinople with ease in 1453 and advanced southwards into the Balkan peninsula capturing Athens in 1458. The Greeks held out in the Peloponnese until 1460, and the Venetians and Genoese clung to some of the islands, but by 1500 most of the plains and islands of Greece were in Ottoman hands. The mountains of Greece were largely untouched, and were a refuge for Greeks to flee foreign rule and engage in guerrilla warfare.
Preparation of the Greek War of Independence.
In the context of ardent desire for independence from Turkish occupation, and with the explicit influence of similar secret societies elsewhere in Europe, three Greeks came together in 1814 in Odessa to decide the constitution for a secret organization in freemasonic fashion. Its purpose was to unite all Greeks in an armed organization to overthrow Turkish rule. The three founders were Nikolaos Skoufas from the Arta province, Emmanuil Xanthos from Patmos and Athanasios Tsakalov from Ioannina. Soon after they initiated a fourth member, Panagiotis Anagnostopoulos from Andritsaina.
Many revolts were planned across the Greek region and the first of them was launched on 6 March 1821, in the Danubian principalities. It was put down by the Ottomans, but the torch had been lit and by the end of the same month the Peloponnese was in open revolt.
Greek War of Independence.
In 1821, the Greek-speaking populations of Peloponnesus revolted against the Ottoman Empire. Following a region-wide struggle that lasted several months, the Greek War of Independence led to the establishment of the first autonomous Greek State since the mid-15th century.
In January 1822, the First National Assembly of Epidaurus passed the (part of the country's First Constitution), which affirmed the sovereignty of Greece. However, the new Greek State was politically unstable and lacked the resources to preserve its territoriality in the long-term. Most importantly, the country lacked international recognition and had no robust alliances in the Western world.
Following the recapture of the Greek territories by the Ottoman Empire, the Great Powers of that time (the British Empire, the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of France) saw the Greek counter-offensive as an opportunity to weaken the Ottoman Empire further and in essence increase their influence in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Great Powers supported Greece to regain its independence and following a decisive battle in the Navarino Bay a cease fire was agreed in London (see Treaty of London (1827)). The autonomy of Greece was ultimately recognised by the London Protocol of 1828 and its full independence from the Ottoman Empire by the Protocol of London of 1830.
In 1831, the assassination of the first Governor of Greece, Count Ioannis Kapodistrias, created political and social instability that endangered the country's relationship with its allies. To avoid escalation and in order to strengthen Greece's ties with the Great Powers, Greece agreed to become a Kingdom in 1832 (see Treaty of London (1832)). Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was initially the first candidate for the Greek throne; however, he turned down the offer. Otto of Wittelsbach, Prince of Bavaria was chosen as its first King. Otto arrived at the provisional capital, Nafplion, in 1833 aboard a British warship.
History.
Reign of King Otto (1832–1862).
Otto's reign would prove troubled, but managed to last for 30 years before he and his wife, Queen Amalia, left the way they came, aboard a British warship. During the early years of his reign, a group of Bavarian Regents ruled in his name and made themselves very unpopular by trying to impose German ideas of rigid hierarchical government on the Greeks, while keeping most significant state offices away from them. Nevertheless, they laid the foundations of a Greek administration, army, justice system and education system. Otto was sincere in his desire to give Greece good government, but he suffered from two great handicaps, his Roman Catholic faith, and the fact that his marriage to Queen Amalia remained childless. Furthermore, the new Kingdom tried to eliminate the traditional banditry, something that in many cases meant conflict with some old revolutionary fighters (klephtes) who continued to exercise this practice.
The Bavarian Regents ruled until 1837, when at the insistence of Britain and France, they were recalled, and Otto after that appointed Greek ministers, although Bavarian officials still ran most of the administration and the army. But Greece still had no legislature and no constitution. Greek discontent grew until a revolt broke out in Athens in September 1843. Otto agreed to grant a constitution, and convened a National Assembly which met in November. The new constitution created a bicameral parliament, consisting of an Assembly ("Vouli") and a Senate ("Gerousia"). Power then passed into the hands of a group of politicians, most of whom had been commanders in the War of Independence against the Ottomans.
Greek politics in the 19th century was dominated by the national question. Greeks dreamed of liberating all the Greek lands and reconstituting a state embracing them all, with Constantinople as its capital. This was called the Great Idea ("Megali Idea"), and it was sustained by almost continuous rebellions against Ottoman rule in Greek-speaking territories, notably Crete, Thessaly and Macedonia. During the Crimean War the British occupied Piraeus to prevent Greece declaring war on the Ottomans as a Russian ally.
A new generation of Greek politicians was growing increasingly intolerant of King Otto's continuing interference in government. In 1862, the King dismissed his Prime Minister, the former admiral Konstantinos Kanaris, the most prominent politician of the period. This dismissal provoked a military rebellion, forcing Otto to accept the inevitable and leave the country. The Greeks then asked Britain to send Queen Victoria's son Prince Alfred as their new king, but this was vetoed by the other Powers. Instead, a young Danish prince became King George I. George was a very popular choice as a constitutional monarch, and he agreed that his sons would be raised in the Greek Orthodox faith. As a reward to the Greeks for adopting a pro-British King, Britain ceded the United States of the Ionian Islands to Greece.
Religious life.
Under Ottoman rule, the Greek Church was a part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Muslims had no control over the church. With the establishment of the Greek Kingdom, however, the government decided to take control of the church, breaking away from the patriarch in Constantinople. The government declared the church to be autocephalous (Independent) in 1833 in a political decision of the Bavarian Regents acting for King Otto, who was a minor. The decision roiled Greek politics for decades as royal authorities took increasing control. The new status was finally recognised as such by the Patriarchate in 1850, under compromise conditions with the issue of a special "Tomos" decree which brought it back to a normal status. As a result, it retains certain special links with the "Mother Church". There were only four bishops, and they had political roles.
In 1833 Parliament dissolved 400 small monasteries having fewer than five monks or nuns. Priests were not salaried; in rural areas he was a peasant farmer himself, dependent for his livelihood on his farm work and from fees and offerings by his parishioners. His ecclesiastical duties were limited to administering the sacraments, supervising funerals, the blessings of crops, and exorcism. Few attended seminaries. By the 1840s, there was a nationwide revival, run by travelling preachers. The government arrested several and tried to shut down the revival, but it proved too powerful when the revivalists denounced three bishops for purchasing their office. By the 1880s the "Anaplasis" ("Regeneration") Movement led to renewed spiritual energy and enlightenment. It fought against the rationalistic and materialistic ideas that had seeped in from secular Western Europe. It promoted catechism schools, and circles for the study the Bible.
Reign of King George I (1863–1913).
At the urging of Britain and King George, Greece adopted a much more democratic constitution in 1864. The powers of the King were reduced and the Senate was abolished, and the franchise was extended to all adult males. Nevertheless, Greek politics remained heavily dynastic, as it had always been. Family names such as Zaimis, Rallis and Trikoupis repeatedly occurred as Prime Ministers. Although parties were centered around the individual leaders, often bearing their names, two broad political tendencies existed: the liberals, led first by Charilaos Trikoupis and later by Eleftherios Venizelos, and the conservatives, led initially by Theodoros Deligiannis and later by Thrasivoulos Zaimis.
Trikoupis and Deligiannis dominated Greek politics in the later 19th century, alternating in office. Trikoupis favoured cooperation with Great Britain in foreign affairs, the creation of infrastructure and an indigenous industry, raising protective tariffs and progressive social legislation, while the more populist Deligiannis depended on the promotion of Greek nationalism and the Megali idea.
Greece remained a quite impoverished country throughout the 19th century. The country lacked raw materials, infrastructure and capital. Agriculture was mostly at the subsistence level, and the only important export commodities were currants, raisins and tobacco. Some Greeks grew rich as merchants and shipowners, and Piraeus became a major port, but little of this wealth found its way to the Greek peasantry. Greece remained hopelessly in debt to London finance houses.
By the 1890s Greece was virtually bankrupt, and public insolvency was declared in 1893. Poverty was rife in the rural areas and the islands and was eased only by large-scale emigration to the United States. There was little education in the countryside. Nevertheless, there was progress in building communications and infrastructure, and elegant public buildings were erected in Athens. Despite the bad financial situation, Athens staged the revival of the Olympic Games in 1896, which proved a great success.
The parliamentary process developed greatly in Greece during the reign of George I. Initially, the royal prerogative in choosing his prime minister remained and contributed to governmental instability, until the introduction of the "dedilomeni" principle of parliamentary confidence in 1875 by the reformist Charilaos Trikoupis. Clientelism and frequent electoral upheavals, however, remained the norm in Greek politics and frustrated the country's development. Corruption and Trikoupis' increased spending to create necessary infrastructure like the Corinth Canal overtaxed the weak Greek economy, forcing the declaration of public insolvency in 1893 and to accept the imposition of an International Financial Control authority to pay off the country's debtors.
Another political issue in 19th-century Greece was uniquely Greek: the language question. The Greek people spoke a form of Greek called Demotic. Many of the educated elite saw this as a peasant dialect and were determined to restore the glories of Ancient Greek. Government documents and newspapers were consequently published in "Katharevousa" (purified) Greek, a form which few ordinary Greeks could read. Liberals favoured recognising Demotic as the national language, but conservatives and the Orthodox Church resisted all such efforts, to the extent that, when the New Testament was translated into Demotic in 1901, riots erupted in Athens and the government fell (the "Evangeliaka"). This issue would continue to plague Greek politics until the 1970s.
All Greeks were united, however, in their determination to liberate the Greek-speaking provinces of the Ottoman Empire. Especially in Crete, a prolonged revolt in 1866–1869 had raised nationalist fervour. When war broke out between Russia and the Ottomans in 1877, popular Greek sentiment rallied to Russia's side, but Greece was too poor and too concerned about British intervention, to officially enter the war. Nevertheless, in 1881, Thessaly and small parts of Epirus were ceded to Greece in the context of the Treaty of Berlin, while frustrating Greek hopes of receiving Crete.
Greeks in Crete continued to stage regular revolts, and in 1897, the Greek government under Theodoros Deligiannis, bowing to popular pressure, declared war on the Ottomans. In the ensuing Greco-Turkish War of 1897 the badly trained and equipped Greek army was defeated by the Ottomans. Through the intervention of the Great Powers, however, Greece lost only a little territory along the border to Turkey, while Crete was established as an autonomous state with the High Commissioner being Prince George of Greece.
Nationalist sentiment among Greeks in the Ottoman Empire continued to grow, and by the 1890s there were constant disturbances in Macedonia. Here the Greeks were in competition not only with the Ottomans but also with the Bulgarians, engaged in an armed propaganda struggle for the hearts and minds of the ethnically mixed local population, the so-called "Macedonian Struggle". In July 1908, the Young Turk Revolution broke out in the Ottoman Empire.
Taking advantage of the Ottoman internal turmoil, Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Bulgaria declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire. On Crete, the local population, led by a young politician named Eleftherios Venizelos, declared "Enosis", Union with Greece, provoking another crisis. The fact that the Greek government, led by Dimitrios Rallis, proved unable likewise to take advantage of the situation and bring Crete into the fold, rankled with many Greeks, especially with young officers. These formed a secret society, the "Military League", with the purpose of emulating their Ottoman colleagues and seek reforms.
The resulting Goudi coup on 15 August 1909 marked a watershed in modern Greek history: as the military conspirators were inexperienced in politics, they asked Venizelos, who had impeccable liberal credentials, to come to Greece as their political adviser. Venizelos quickly established himself as an influential political figure, and his allies won the August 1910 elections. Venizelos became Prime Minister in October 1910, ushering a period of 25 years where his personality would dominate Greek politics.
Venizelos initiated a major reform program, including a new and more liberal constitution and reforms in the spheres of public administration, education and economy. French and British military missions were invited for the army and navy respectively, and arms purchases were made. In the meantime, the Ottoman Empire's weaknesses were revealed by the ongoing Italo-Turkish War in Libya.
Through spring 1912, a series of bilateral agreements among the Balkan states (Greece, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Serbia) formed the Balkan League, which in October 1912 declared war on the Ottoman Empire.
Balkan Wars.
Macedonian front.
Ottoman intelligence had disastrously misread Greek military intentions. In retrospect, it would appear that the Ottoman staffs believed that the Greek attack would be shared equally between the two primary avenues of approach, Macedonia and Epirus. The 2nd Army staff had therefore evenly balanced the combat strength of the seven Ottoman divisions between the Yanya Corps and VIII Corps, in Epirus and Macedonia respectively. The Greek Army also fielded seven divisions, but, having the initiative, concentrated all seven against VIII Corps, leaving only a number of independent battalions of scarcely divisional strength in the Epirus front. This had fatal consequences for the Western Group of Armies, since it led to the early loss of the strategic centre of all three Macedonian fronts, the city of Thessaloniki, a fact that sealed their fate. In an unexpectedly brilliant and rapid campaign, the Army of Thessaly seized the city. In the absence of secure sea lines of communications, the retention of the Thessaloniki-Constantinople corridor was essential to the overall strategic posture of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans. Once this was gone, the defeat of the Ottoman Army became inevitable. To be sure, the Bulgarians and the Serbs played a significant role in the defeat of the main Ottoman armies. Their great victories at Kirkkilise, Lüleburgaz, Kumanovo, and Monastir shattered the Eastern and Vardar armies. However, these victories were not decisive in the sense that they ended the war. The Ottoman field armies survived, and in Thrace, they actually grew stronger day by day. In the strategic point of view these victories were enabled partially by the weakened condition of the Ottoman armies brought about by the active presence of the Greek army and fleet.
With the declaration of war, the Greek Army of Thessaly under Crown Prince Constantine advanced to the north, successfully overcoming Ottoman opposition in the fortified Straits of Sarantaporo. After another victory at Giannitsa on , the Ottoman commander Hasan Tahsin Pasha surrendered Thessaloniki and its garrison of 26,000 men to the Greeks on . Two Corps HQs (Ustruma and VIII), two Nizamiye divisions (14th and 22nd) and four Redif divisions (Salonika, Drama, Naslic and Serez) were thus lost to the Ottoman order of battle. Additionally, the Ottoman forces lost 70 artillery pieces, 30 machine guns and 70,000 rifles (Thessaloniki was the central arms depot for the Western Armies). The Ottoman forces estimated that 15,000 officers and men had been killed during the campaign in Macedonia, bringing total losses up to 41,000 soldiers. Another direct consequence was that the destruction of the Macedonian Army sealed the fate of the Ottoman Vardar Army, which was fighting the Serbs to the north. The fall of Thessaloniki left it strategically isolated, without logistical supply and depth to manoeuvre, ensuring its destruction.
Upon learning of the outcome of the battle of Yenidje, the Bulgarian high command urgently dispatched their 7th "Rila" Division from the north in the direction of the city. The division arrived there a week later, the day after its surrender to the Greeks. Until 10 November, the Greek-occupied zone had been expanded to the line from Lake Dojran to the Pangaion hills west to Kavalla. In southern Yugoslavia however, the lack of coordination between the Greek and Serbian HQs cost the Greeks a setback in the Battle of Vevi on , when the Greek 5th Infantry Division crossed its way with the VI Ottoman Corps (a part of the Vardar Army consisting of the 16th, 17th and 18th Nizamiye divisions), retreating to Albania following the battle of Prilep against the Serbs. The Greek division, surprised by the presence of the Ottoman Corps, isolated from the rest of Greek army and outnumbered by the now counterattacking Ottomans centred on Bitola, was forced to retreat. As a result, the Serbs beat the Greeks to Bitola.
Epirus front.
In the Epirus front the Greek army was initially heavily outnumbered, but due to the passive attitude of the Ottomans succeeded in conquering Preveza (21 October 1912) and pushing north to the direction of Ioannina. On 5 November, Major Spyros Spyromilios led a revolt in the coastal area of Himarë and expelled the Ottoman garrison without facing significant resistance, while on 20 November Greek troops from western Macedonia entered Korçë. However, Greek forces in the Epirote front had not the numbers to initiate an offensive against the German-designed defensive positions of Bizani that protected the city of Ioannina, and therefore had to wait for reinforcements from the Macedonian front.
After the campaign in Macedonia was over, a large part of the Army was redeployed to Epirus, where Crown Prince Constantine himself assumed command. In the Battle of Bizani the Ottoman positions were breached and Ioannina taken on . During the siege, on 8 February 1913, the Russian pilot N. de Sackoff, flying for the Greeks, became the first pilot ever shot down in combat, when his biplane was hit by ground fire following a bomb run on the walls of Fort Bizani. He came down near small town of Preveza, on the coast north of the Ionian island of Lefkas, secured local Greek assistance, repaired his plane and resumed flight back to base. The fall of Ioannina allowed the Greek army to continue its advance into northern Epirus, the southern part of modern Albania, which it occupied. There its advance stopped, although the Serbian line of control was very close to the north.
Naval operations in the Aegean and Ionian seas.
On the outbreak of hostilities on 18 October, the Greek fleet, placed under the newly promoted Rear Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, sailed for the island of Lemnos, occupying it three days later (although fighting continued on the island until 27 October) and establishing an anchorage at Moudros Bay. This move was of major strategic importance, as it provided the Greeks with a forward base in close distance to the Dardanelles, the Ottoman fleet's main anchorage and refuge. In view of the Ottoman fleet's superiority in speed and broadside weight, the Greek planners expected it to sortie from the straits early in the war. Given the Greek fleet's unpreparedness resulting from the premature outbreak of the war, such an early Ottoman attack might well have been able to achieve a crucial victory. Instead, the Ottoman Navy spent the first two months of the war in operations against the Bulgarians in the Black Sea, giving the Greeks valuable time to complete their preparations and allowing them to consolidate their control of the Aegean.
By mid-November Greek naval detachments had seized the islands of Imbros, Thasos, Agios Efstratios, Samothrace, Psara and Ikaria, while landings were undertaken on the larger islands of Lesbos and Chios only on 21 and 27 November respectively. Substantial Ottoman garrisons were present on the latter, and their resistance was fierce. They withdrew into the mountainous interior and were not subdued until 22 December and 3 January respectively. Samos, officially an autonomous principality, was not attacked until 13 March 1913, out of a desire not to upset the Italians in the nearby Dodecanese. The clashes there were short-lived as the Ottoman forces withdrew to the Anatolian mainland so that the island was securely in Greek hands by 16 March.
At the same time, with the aid of numerous merchant ships converted to auxiliary cruisers, a loose naval blockade on the Ottoman coasts from the Dardanelles to Suez was instituted, which disrupted the Ottomans' flow of supplies (only the Black Sea routes to Romania remained open) and left some 250,000 Ottoman troops immobilized in Asia. In the Ionian Sea, the Greek fleet operated without opposition, ferrying supplies for the army units in the Epirus front. Furthermore, the Greeks bombarded and then blockaded the port of Vlorë in Albania on 3 December, and Durrës on 27 February. A naval blockade extending from the pre-war Greek border to Vlorë was also instituted on 3 December, isolating the newly established Provisional Government of Albania based there from any outside support.
Lieutenant Nikolaos Votsis scored a major success for Greek morale on 31 October: he sailed his torpedo boat No. 11, under the cover of night, into the harbor of Thessaloniki, sank the old Ottoman ironclad battleship "Feth-i Bülend" and escaped unharmed. On the same day, Greek troops of the Epirus Army seized the Ottoman naval base of Preveza. The Ottomans scuttled the four ships present there, but the Greeks were able to salvage the Italian-built torpedo-boats "Antalya" and "Tokat", which were commissioned into the Greek Navy as "Nikopolis" and "Tatoi" respectively. On 9 November, the wooden Ottoman armed steamer "Trabzon" was intercepted and sunk by the Greek torpedo boat No. 14 under Lt. Periklis Argyropoulos off Ayvalık.
Confrontations off the Dardanelles.
The main Ottoman fleet remained inside the Dardanelles for the early part of the war, while the Greek destroyers continuously patrolled the Straits' exit to report on a possible sortie. Kountouriotis suggested mining the straits, but was not taken up for fear of international reactions. On 7 December, the head of the Ottoman fleet Tahir Bey was replaced by Ramiz Naman Bey, the leader of the hawkish faction among the officer corps. A new strategy was agreed, whereby the Ottomans were to take advantage of any absence of the Greek flagship "Averof" to attack the other Greek ships. The Ottoman staff formulated a plan to lure a number of the Greek destroyers on patrol into a trap. A first such effort on 12 December failed due to boiler trouble, but the second try two days later resulted in an indecisive engagement between the Greek destroyers and the cruiser "Mecidiye".
The war's first major fleet action, the Naval Battle of Elli, was fought two days later, on . The Ottoman fleet, with four battleships, nine destroyers and six torpedo boats, sailed to the entrance of the straits. The lighter Ottoman vessels remained behind, but the battleship squadron moved on north under cover of the forts at Kumkale and engaged the Greek fleet, coming from Imbros, at 9:40. Leaving the older battleships behind, Kountouriotis led the "Averof" into independent action: utilizing its superior speed, it cut across the Ottoman fleet's bow. Under fire from two sides, the Ottomans were quickly forced to withdraw to the Dardanelles. The whole engagement lasted less than an hour, in which the Ottoman suffered heavy damage to the "Barbaros Hayreddin" and 18 dead and 41 wounded (most during their disorderly retreat) and the Greeks one dead and seven wounded.
In the aftermath of Elli, on 20 December the energetic Lt. Commander Rauf Bey was placed in effective command of the Ottoman fleet. Two days later he led his forces out, hoping again to trap the patrolling Greek destroyers between two divisions of the Ottoman fleet, one heading for Imbros and the other waiting at the entrance of the straits. The plan failed as the Greek ships quickly broke contact, while at the same time the "Mecidiye" came under attack by the Greek submarine "Delfin", which launched a torpedo against it but missed; the first such attack in history. During this time, the Ottoman Army continued to press upon a reluctant Navy a plan for the re-occupation of Tenedos, which the Greek destroyers used as a base, by an amphibious operation. The operation was scheduled for 4 January. On that day, weather conditions were ideal, and the fleet was ready, but the "Yenihan" regiment earmarked for the operation failed to arrive on time. The naval staff nevertheless ordered the fleet to sortie, and an engagement developed with the Greek fleet, without any significant results on either side. Similar sorties followed on 10 and 11 January, but the results of these "cat and mouse" operations were always the same: "the Greek destroyers always managed to remain outside the Ottoman warships' range, and each time the cruisers fired a few rounds before breaking off the chase."
In preparation for the next attempt to break the Greek blockade, the Ottoman Admiralty decided to create a diversion by sending the light cruiser "Hamidiye", captained by Rauf Bey, to raid Greek merchant shipping in the Aegean. It was hoped that the "Averof", the only major Greek unit fast enough to catch the "Hamidiye", would be drawn in pursuit and leave the remainder of the Greek fleet weakened. In the event, "Hamidiye" slipped through the Greek patrols on the night of 14–15 January and bombarded the harbor of the Greek island of Syros, sinking the Greek auxiliary cruiser "Makedonia" which lay in anchor there (it was later raised and repaired). The "Hamidiye" then left the Aegean for the Eastern Mediterranean, making stops at Beirut and Port Said before entering the Red Sea. Although providing a major morale boost for the Ottomans, the operation failed to achieve its primary objective, as Kountouriotis refused to leave his post and pursue the "Hamidiye".
Four days later, on , when the Ottoman fleet again sallied from the straits towards Lemnos, it was defeated for a second time in the Naval Battle of Lemnos. This time, the Ottoman warships concentrated their fire on the "Averof", which again made use of its superior speed and tried to "cross the T" of the Ottoman fleet. "Barbaros Hayreddin" was again heavily damaged, and the Ottoman fleet was forced to return to the shelter of the Dardanelles and their forts. The Ottomans suffered 41 killed and 101 wounded. It was the last attempt of the Ottoman Navy to leave the Dardanelles, thereby leaving the Greeks dominant in the Aegean. On , a Greek Farman MF.7, piloted by Lt. Moutousis and with Ensign Moraitinis as an observer, carried out an aerial reconnaissance of the Ottoman fleet in its anchorage at Nagara, and launched four bombs on the anchored ships. Although it scored no hits, this operation is regarded as the first naval-air operation in military history.
General Ivanov, commander of the 2nd Bulgarian Army, acknowledged the role of the Greek fleet in the overall Balkan League victory by stating that "the activity of the entire Greek fleet and above all the "Averof" was the chief factor in the general success of the allies".
End of the War.
The Treaty of London ended the war, but no one was left satisfied, and soon, the four allies fell out over the partition of Macedonia. In June 1913, Bulgaria attacked Greece and Serbia, beginning the Second Balkan War, but was beaten back. The Treaty of Bucharest, which concluded the war, left Greece with southern Epirus, the southern-half of Macedonia, Crete and the Aegean islands, except for the Dodecanese, which had been occupied by Italy in 1911. These gains nearly doubled Greece's area and population.
1914–1924: World War I, crises, and the first abolition of the monarchy.
In March 1913, an anarchist, Alexandros Schinas, assassinated King George in Thessaloniki, and his son came to the throne as Constantine I. Constantine was the first Greek king born in Greece and the first to be Greek Orthodox. His very name had been chosen in the spirit of romantic Greek nationalism (the "Megali Idea"), evoking the Byzantine emperors of that name. Besides, as the Commander-in-chief of the Greek Army during the Balkan Wars, his popularity was enormous, rivalled only by that of Venizelos, his Prime Minister.
When World War I broke out in 1914, despite Greece's treaty of alliance with Serbia, both leaders preferred to maintain a neutral stance. However, when, in early 1915, the Allied Powers asked for Greek help in the Dardanelles campaign, offering Cyprus in exchange, their diverging views became apparent: Constantine had been educated in Germany, was married to Sophia of Prussia, sister of Kaiser Wilhelm, and was convinced of the Central Powers' victory. Venizelos, on the other hand, was an ardent anglophile, and believed in an Allied victory.
Since Greece, a maritime country, could not oppose the mighty British navy, and citing the need for a respite after two wars, King Constantine favoured continued neutrality, while Venizelos actively sought Greek entry in the war on the Allied side. Venizelos resigned, but won the next elections, and again formed the government. When Bulgaria entered the war as a German ally in October 1915, Venizelos invited Entente forces into Greece (the Salonika Front), for which he was again dismissed by Constantine.
In August 1916, after several incidents where both combatants encroached upon the still theoretically neutral Greek territory, Venizelist officers rose up in Allied-controlled Thessaloniki, and Venizelos established a separate government there. Constantine was now ruling only in what was Greece before the Balkan Wars ("Old Greece"), and his government was subject to repeated humiliations from the Allies. In November 1916 the French occupied Piraeus, bombarded Athens and forced the Greek fleet to surrender. The royalist troops fired at them, leading to a battle between French and Greek royalist forces. There were also riots against supporters of Venizelos in Athens (the "Noemvriana").
Following the February Revolution in Russia, however, the Tsar's support for his cousin was removed, and Constantine was forced to leave the country, without actually abdicating in June 1917. His second son Alexander became King, while the remaining royal family and the most prominent royalists followed into exile. Venizelos now led a superficially united Greece into the war on the Allied side, but underneath the surface, the division of Greek society into Venizelists and anti-Venizelists, the so-called National Schism, became more entrenched.
With the end of the war in November 1918, the moribund Ottoman Empire was ready to be carved up amongst the victors, and Greece now expected the Allied Powers to deliver on their promises. In no small measure through the diplomatic efforts of Venizelos, Greece secured Western Thrace in the Treaty of Neuilly in November 1919 and Eastern Thrace and a zone around Smyrna in western Anatolia (already under Greek administration since May 1919) in the Treaty of Sèvres of August 1920. The future of Constantinople was left to be determined. But at the same time, a nationalist movement had arisen in Turkey, led by Mustafa Kemal (later Kemal Atatürk), who set up a rival government in Ankara and was engaged in fighting the Greek army.
At this point, nevertheless, the fulfillment of the "Megali Idea" seemed near. Yet so deep was the rift in Greek society, that on his return to Greece, an assassination attempt was made on Venizelos by two former royalist officers. Even more surprisingly, Venizelos' Liberal Party lost the elections called in November 1920, and in a referendum shortly after, the Greek people voted for the return of King Constantine from exile, following the sudden death of Alexander. The United Opposition, which had campaigned on the slogan of an end to the war in Anatolia, instead intensified it. However, the royalist restoration had dire consequences: many veteran Venizelist officers were dismissed or left the army, while Italy and France found the return of the hated Constantine a useful pretext for switching their support to Kemal. Finally, in August 1922, the Turkish army shattered the Greek front, and took Smyrna.
The Greek army evacuated not only Anatolia but also Eastern Thrace and the islands of Imbros and Tenedos (Treaty of Lausanne). A compulsory population exchange was agreed between the two countries, with over 1.5 million Christians and almost half a million Muslims being uprooted. This catastrophe marked the end of the "Megali Idea", and left Greece financially exhausted, demoralised, and having to house and feed a proportionately huge number of refugees.
The catastrophe deepened the political crisis, with the returning army rising under Venizelist officers and forcing King Constantine to abdicate again, in September 1922, in favour of his firstborn son, George II. The "Revolutionary Committee", headed by Colonels Stylianos Gonatas (soon to become Prime Minister) and Nikolaos Plastiras engaged in a witch-hunt against the royalists, culminating in the "Trial of the Six". In October 1923, elections were called for December, which would form a National Assembly with powers to draft a new constitution. Following a failed royalist coup, the monarchist parties abstained, leading to a landslide for the Liberals and their allies. King George II was asked to leave the country, and on 25 March 1924, Alexandros Papanastasiou proclaimed the Second Hellenic Republic, ratified by plebiscite a month later.
Restoration of Monarchy and the 4th of August Regime.
On 10 October 1935, a few months after he suppressed a Venizelist Coup in March 1935, Georgios Kondylis, the former Venizelist stalwart, abolished the Republic in another coup and declared the monarchy restored. A rigged plebiscite confirmed the regime change (with an unsurprising 97.88% of votes), and King George II returned.
King George II immediately dismissed Kondylis and appointed Professor Konstantinos Demertzis as interim Prime Minister. Venizelos meanwhile, in exile, urged an end to the conflict over the monarchy given the threat to Greece from the rise of Fascist Italy. His successors as Liberal leader, Themistoklis Sophoulis and Georgios Papandreou, agreed, and the restoration of the monarchy was accepted. The 1936 elections resulted in a hung parliament, with the Communists holding the balance. As no government could be formed, Demertzis continued. At the same time, a series of deaths left the Greek political scene in disarray: Kondylis died in February, Venizelos in March, Demertzis in April and Tsaldaris in May. The road was now clear for Ioannis Metaxas, who had succeeded Demertzis as interim Prime Minister.
Metaxas, a retired royalist general, believed that an authoritarian government was necessary to prevent social conflict and, especially, quell the rising power of the Communists. On 4 August 1936, with the King's support, he suspended parliament and established the 4th of August Regime. The Communists were suppressed and the Liberal leaders went into internal exile. Metaxas' regime promoted various concepts such as the "Third Hellenic Civilization", the Roman salute, a national youth organization, and introduced measures to gain popular support, such as the Greek Social Insurance Institute (IKA), still the biggest social security institution in Greece.
Despite these efforts, the regime lacked a broad popular base or a mass movement supporting it. The Greek people were generally apathetic, without actively opposing Metaxas. Metaxas also improved the country's defences in preparation for the forthcoming European war, constructing, among other defensive measures, the "Metaxas Line". Despite his aping of Fascism and the strong economic ties with resurgent Nazi Germany, Metaxas followed a policy of neutrality, given Greece's traditionally strong ties to Britain, reinforced by King George II's personal Anglophilia. In April 1939, the Italian threat suddenly loomed closer, as Italy annexed Albania, whereupon Britain publicly guaranteed Greece's borders. Thus, when World War II broke out in September 1939, Greece remained neutral.
World War II.
Despite this declared neutrality, Greece became a target for Mussolini's expansionist policies. Provocations against Greece included the sinking of the light cruiser "Elli" on 15 August 1940. Italian troops crossed the border on 28 October 1940, beginning the Greco-Italian War, but were stopped by a determined Greek defence, and ultimately driven back into Albania. Metaxas died suddenly in January 1941. His death raised hopes of a liberalisation of his regime and the restoration of parliamentary rule, but King George quashed these hopes when he retained the regime's machinery in place.
In the meantime, Adolf Hitler was reluctantly forced to divert German troops to rescue Mussolini from defeat, and attacked Greece through Yugoslavia and Bulgaria on 6 April 1941. Despite British assistance, by the end of May, the Germans had overrun most of the country. The King and the government escaped to Crete, where they stayed until the end of the Battle of Crete. They then transferred to Egypt, where a government in exile was established.
The occupied country was divided into three zones (German, Italian and Bulgarian) and in Athens, a puppet regime was established. The members were either conservatives or nationalists with fascist leanings. The three quisling prime ministers were Georgios Tsolakoglou, the general who had signed the armistice with the Wehrmacht, Konstantinos Logothetopoulos, and Ioannis Rallis, who took office when the German defeat was inevitable, and aimed primarily at combating the left-wing Resistance movement. To this end, he created the collaborationist Security Battalions.
Greece suffered terrible privations during World War II, as the Germans appropriated most of the country's agricultural production and prevented its fishing fleets from operating. As a result, and because a British blockade initially hindered foreign relief efforts, a wide-scale famine resulted, when hundreds of thousands perished, especially in the winter of 1941–1942. In the mountains of the Greek mainland, in the meantime, several resistance movements sprang up, and by mid-1943, the Axis forces controlled only the main towns and the connecting roads, while a "Free Greece" was set up in the mountains.
The largest resistance group, the National Liberation Front (EAM), was controlled by the Communists, as was (ELAS) led by Aris Velouchiotis and a civil war soon broke out between it and non-Communist groups such as the National Republican Greek League (EDES) in those areas liberated from the Germans. The exiled government in Cairo was only intermittently in touch with the resistance movement, and exercised virtually no influence in the occupied country.
Part of this was due to the unpopularity of the King George II in Greece itself, but despite efforts by Greek politicians, British support ensured his retention at the head of the Cairo government. As the German defeat drew nearer, the various Greek political factions convened in Lebanon in May 1944, under British auspices, and formed a government of national unity, under George Papandreou, in which EAM was represented by six ministers.
Greek Civil War (1946–49).
German forces withdrew on 12 October 1944, and the government in exile returned to Athens. After the German withdrawal, the EAM-ELAS guerrilla army effectively controlled most of Greece, but its leaders were reluctant to take control of the country, as they knew that Stalin had agreed that Greece would be in the British sphere of influence after the war. Tensions between the British-backed Papandreou and EAM, especially over the issue of disarmament of the various armed groups, leading to the resignation of the latter's ministers from the government.
A few days later, on 3 December 1944, a large-scale pro-EAM demonstration in Athens ended in violence and ushered an intense, house-to-house struggle with British and monarchist forces (the "Dekemvriana"). After three weeks, the Communists were defeated: the Varkiza agreement ended the conflict and disarmed ELAS, and an unstable coalition government was formed. The anti-EAM backlash grew into a full-scale "White Terror", which exacerbated tensions.
The Communists boycotted the March 1946 elections, and on the same day, fighting broke out again. By the end of 1946, the Communist Democratic Army of Greece had been formed, pitted against the governmental National Army, which was backed first by Britain and after 1947 by the United States.
Communist successes in 1947–1948 enabled them to move freely over much of mainland Greece, but with the extensive reorganisation, the deportation of rural populations and American material support, the National Army was slowly able to regain control over most of the countryside. In 1949, the insurgents suffered a major blow, as Yugoslavia closed its borders following the split between Marshal Josip Broz Tito with the Soviet Union.
In August 1949, the National Army under Marshal Alexander Papagos launched an offensive that forced the remaining insurgents to surrender or flee across the northern border into the territory of Greece's northern Communist neighbours. The civil war resulted in 100,000 killed and caused catastrophic economic disruption. Moreover, at least 25,000 Greeks were either voluntarily or forcibly evacuated to Eastern bloc countries, while 700,000 became displaced persons inside the country. Many more emigrated to Australia and other countries.
The postwar settlement saw Greece's territorial expansion, which had begun in 1832, come to an end. The 1947 Treaty of Paris required Italy to hand over the Dodecanese islands to Greece. These were the last majority-Greek-speaking areas to be united with the Greek state, apart from Cyprus which was a British possession until it became independent in 1960. Greece's ethnic homogeneity was increased by the postwar expulsion of 25,000 Albanians from Epirus (see Cham Albanians).
The only significant remaining minorities are the Muslims in Western Thrace (about 100,000) and a small Slavic-speaking minority in the north. Greek nationalists continued to claim southern Albania (which they called Northern Epirus), home of a significant Greek population (about 3%–12% in the whole of Albania), and the Turkish-held islands of Imvros and Tenedos, where there were smaller Greek minorities.
Postwar Greece and the fall of the monarchy (1950–1973).
During the Civil war (1946–49) but even more after that, the parties in the parliament were divided into three political concentrations. The political formation Right-Centre-Left, given the exacerbation of political animosity that had preceded dividing the country in the 1940s, tended to turn the concurrence of parties into ideological positions.
At the beginning of the 1950s, the forces of the Centre (EPEK) succeeded in gaining the power and under the leadership of the aged general Nikolaos Plastiras they governed for about half a four-year term. These were a series of governments having limited manoeuvre ability and inadequate influence in the political arena. This government, as well as those that followed, was constantly under the American auspices. The defeat of EPEK in the elections of 1952, apart from increasing the repressive measures that concerned the defeated of the Civil war, also marked the end of the general political position that it represented, namely political consensus and social reconciliation.
The Left, which had been ostracised from the political life of the country, found a way of expression through the constitution of EDA (United Democratic Left) in 1951, which turned out to be a significant pole, yet steadily excluded from the decision making centres. After the disbandment of the Centre as an autonomous political institution, EDA practically expanded its electoral influence to a significant part of the EAM-based Centre-Left.
The 1960s are part of the period 1953–72, during which Greek economy developed rapidly and was structured within the scope of European and worldwide economic developments. One of the key features of that period was the major political event of the country's accession to the EEC, in an attempt to create a common market. The relevant treaty was contracted in 1962.
The developmental strategy adopted by the country was embodied in centrally organised five-year plans; yet their orientation was indistinct. The average annual emigration, which absorbed the excess workforce and contributed to extremely high growth rates, exceeded the annual natural increase in population. The influx of large amounts of foreign private capital was being facilitated, and consumption was expanded. These, associated with the rise of tourism, the expansion of shipping activity and with the migrant remittances, had a positive effect on the balance of payments.
The peak of development was registered principally in manufacture, mainly in the textile and chemical industry and in the sector of metallurgy, the growth rate of which tended to reach 11% during 1965–70. The other large branch where distinct economic and social consequences were brought about, was that of construction. Consideration, a Greek invention, favoured the creation of a class of small-medium contractors on the one hand and settled the housing system and property status on the other.
During that decade, youth came forth in society as a distinct social power with the autonomous presence (creation of a new culture in music, fashion, etc.) and displaying dynamism in the assertion of their social rights. The independence granted to Cyprus, which was mined from the very beginning, constituted the primary focus of young activist mobilisations, along with struggles aiming at reforms in education, which were provisionally realised to a certain extent through the educational reform of 1964. The country reckoned on and was influenced by Europe – usually behind time – and by the current trends like never before. Thus, in a sense, the imposition of the military junta conflicted with the social and cultural occurrences.
The country descended into a prolonged political crisis, and elections were scheduled for late April 1967. On 21 April 1967 however, a group of right-wing colonels led by Colonel Georgios Papadopoulos seized power in a coup d'état establishing the Regime of the Colonels. Civil liberties were suppressed, special military courts were established, and political parties were dissolved. Several thousand suspected communists and political opponents were imprisoned or exiled to remote Greek islands. Alleged US support for the junta is claimed to be the cause of rising anti-Americanism in Greece during and following the junta's harsh rule.
However, the junta's early years also saw a marked upturn in the economy, with increased foreign investment and large-scale infrastructure works. The junta was widely condemned abroad, but inside the country, discontent began to increase only after 1970, when the economy slowed down. Even the armed forces, the regime's foundation, were not immune. In May 1973, a planned coup by the Hellenic Navy was narrowly suppressed but led to the mutiny of the , whose officers sought political asylum in Italy. In response, junta leader Papadopoulos attempted to steer the regime towards a controlled democratization, abolishing the monarchy and declaring himself President of the Republic.
Politics.
Greek Monarchical Constitutions.
The first constitution of the Kingdom of Greece was the Greek Constitution of 1844. On 3 September 1843, the military garrison of Athens, with the help of citizens, rebelled and demanded from King Otto the concession of a Constitution.
The Constitution that was proclaimed in March 1844 came from the workings of the "Third of September National Assembly of the Hellenes in Athens" and was a Constitutional Pact, in other words, a contract between the monarch and the Nation. This Constitution re-established the Constitutional Monarchy and was based on the French Constitution of 1830 and the Belgian Constitution of 1831.
Its main provisions were the following: It established the principle of monarchical sovereignty, as the monarch was the decisive power of the State; the legislative power was to be exercised by the King – who also had the right to ratify the laws – by the Parliament, and by the Senate. The members of the Parliament could be no less than 80, and they were elected for a three-year term by universal suffrage. The senators were appointed for life by the King, and their number was set at 27, although that figure could increase should the need arise and per the monarch's will, but it could not exceed half the number of the members of Parliament.
The ministers' responsibility for the King's actions is established, who also appoints and removes them. Justice stems from the King and is dispensed in his name by the judges he himself appoints.
Lastly, this Assembly voted the electoral law of 18 March 1844, which was the first European law to provide, in essence, for universal male suffrage.
The Second National Assembly of the Hellenes took place in Athens (1863–1864) and dealt both with the election of a new sovereign as well as with the drafting of a new Constitution, thereby implementing the transition from constitutional monarchy to a Crowned republic.
Following the refusal of Prince Alfred of Great Britain (who was elected by an overwhelming majority in the first referendum of the country in November 1862) to accept the crown of the Greek kingdom, the government offered the crown to the Danish prince George Christian Willem of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gluecksburg, who was crowned constitutional King of Greece under the name "George I, King of the Hellenes".
The Constitution of 1864 was drafted following the models of the Constitutions of Belgium of 1831 and of Denmark of 1849, and established in clear terms the principle of popular sovereignty, since the only legislative body with reversionary powers was now the Parliament. Furthermore, article 31 reiterated that all the powers stemmed from the Nation and were to be exercised as provided by the Constitution, while article 44 established the principle of accountability, taking into consideration that the King only possessed the powers that were bestowed on him by the Constitution and by the laws applying the same.
The Assembly chose the system of a single chamber Parliament (Vouli) with a four-year term, and hence abolished the Senate, which many accused of being a tool in the hands of the monarchy. Direct, secret and universal elections were adopted as the manner to elect the MPs, while elections were to be held simultaneously throughout the entire nation.
Additionally, article 71 introduced a conflict between being an MP and a salaried public employee or mayor at the same time, but not with serving as an army officer.
The Constitution reiterated various clauses found in the Constitution of 1844, such as that the King appoints and dismisses the ministers and that the latter are responsible for the person of the monarch, but it also allowed for the Parliament to establish "examination committees". Moreover, the King preserved the right to convoke the Parliament in ordinary as well as in extraordinary sessions, and to dissolve it at his discretion, provided, however, that the dissolution decree was also countersigned by the Cabinet.
The Constitution repeated verbatim the clause of article 24 of the Constitution of 1844, according to which "The King appoints and removes his Ministers". This phrase insinuated that the ministers were practically subordinate to the monarch, and thereby answered not only to the Parliament but to him as well. Moreover, nowhere was it stated in the Constitution that the King was obliged to appoint the Cabinet in conformity with the will of the majority in Parliament. This was, however, the interpretation that the modernizing political forces of the land upheld, invoking the principle of popular sovereignty and the spirit of the Parliamentary regime.
They finally succeeded in imposing it through the principle of "manifest confidence" of the Parliament, which was expressed in 1875 by Charilaos Trikoupis and which, that same year, in his Crown Speech, King George I expressly pledged to uphold: "I demand as a prerequisite, of all that I call beside me to assist me in governing the country, to possess the manifest confidence and trust of the majority of the Nation's representatives. Furthermore, I accept this approval to stem from the Parliament, as without it the harmonious functioning of the polity would be impossible".
The establishment of the principle of "manifest confidence" towards the end of the first decade of the crowned democracy, contributed towards the disappearance of a constitutional practice which, in many ways, reiterated the negative experiences of the period of the reign of King Otto. Indeed, from 1864 through 1875 numerous elections of dubious validity had taken place, while, additionally and most importantly, there was an active involvement of the Throne in political affairs through the appointment of governments enjoying a minority in Parliament, or through the forced resignation of majority governments, when their political views clashed with those of the crown.
The Greek Constitution of 1911 was a major step forward in the constitutional history of Greece. Following the rise to power of Eleftherios Venizelos after the Goudi revolt in 1909, Venizelos set about attempting to reform the state. The main outcome of this was a major revision to the Greek Constitution of 1864.
The most noteworthy amendments to the Constitution of 1864 concerning the protection of human rights, were the more effective protection of personal security, equality in tax burdens, of the right to assemble and of the inviolability of the domicile. Furthermore, the Constitution facilitated expropriation to allocate property to landless farmers, while simultaneously judicially protecting property rights.
Other important changes included the institution of an Electoral Court for the settlement of election disputes stemming from the parliamentary elections, the addition of new conflicts for MPs, the re-establishment of the State Council as the highest administrative court (which, however, was constituted and operated only under the Constitution of 1927), the improvement of the protection of judicial independence and the establishment of the non-removability of public employees. Finally, for the first time, the Constitution provided for mandatory and free education for all, and declared Katharevousa (i.e. archaising "purified" Greek) as the "official language of the Nation".
Economy.
19th century.
Greece entered its period of new-won independence in a somewhat different state than Serbia, which shared many of the post-independence economic problems such as land reform. In 1833, the Greeks took control of a countryside devastated by war, depopulated in places and hampered by primitive agriculture and marginal soils. Just as in Serbia, communications were bad, presenting obstacles for any wider foreign commerce. Even by the late 19th-century Agricultural development had not advanced as significantly as had been intended as William Moffet, the US Consul in Athens explained:
"agriculture is here in the most undeveloped condition. Even in the immediate neighbourhood of Athens, it is common to find the wooden plough and the rude mattock which were in use 2,000 years ago. Fields are ploughed up or scratched over, and crops replanted season after season until the exhausted soil will bear no more. Fertilizers are not used to any appreciable extent, and the farm implements are of the very rudest description. Irrigation is in use in some districts, and, as far as I can ascertain, the methods in use can be readily learned by a study of the practices of the ancient Egyptians. Greece has olives and grapes in abundance, and of quality not excelled, but Greek olive oil and Greek wine will not bear transportation."
Greece had a strong wealthy commercial class of rural notables and island shipowners, and access to of land expropriated from Muslim owners who had been driven off during the War of Independence.
Land reform.
Land reform represented the first real test for the new Greek kingdom. The new Greek government deliberately adopted land reforms intended to create a class of free peasants. The "Law for the Dotation of Greek Families" of 1835 extended 2,000 drachmas credit to every family, to be used to buy a farm at auction under a low-cost loan plan. The country was full of displaced refugees and empty Ottoman estates.
By a series of land reforms over several decades, the government distributed this confiscated land among veterans and the poor, so that by 1870 most Greek peasant families owned about . These farms were too small for prosperity, but the land reform signalled the goal of a society in which Greeks were equals and could support themselves, instead of working for hire on the estates of the rich. The class basis of rivalry between Greek factions was thereby reduced.
20th century.
Industry.
The series of wars between 1912 and 1922 provided a catalyst for Greek industry, with a number of industries such as textiles; ammunition and boot-making springing up to supply the military. After the wars most of these industries were converted to civilian uses. Greek refugees from Asia Minor, the most famous of which was Aristotle Onassis who hails from Smyrna (modern Izmir) also had a tremendous impact on the evolution of Greek industry and banking. Greeks held 45% of the capital in the Ottoman Empire before 1914, and many of the refugees expelled from Turkey had funds and skills which they quickly put to use in Greece.
These refugees from Asia Minor also led to rapid growth of urban areas in Greece, as the vast majority of them settled in urban centres such as Athens and Thessaloniki. The 1920 census reported that 36.3% of Greeks lived in urban or semi-urban areas, while the 1928 census reported that 45.6% of Greeks lived in urban or semi-urban areas. It has been argued by many Greek economists that these refugees kept Greek industry competitive during the 1920s, as the surplus of labour kept real wages very low. Although this thesis makes economic sense, it is sheer speculation as there is no reliable data on wages and prices in Greece during this period.
Greek industry went into decline slightly before the country joined the EC, and this trend continued. Although worker productivity rose significantly in Greece, labour costs increased too fast for the Greek manufacturing industry to remain competitive in Europe. There was also very little modernization in Greek industries due to a lack of financing.
Dichotomization of the drachma.
Budgetary problems caused the Greek government to begin an interesting economic experiment, the dichotomization of the drachma. Unable to secure any more loans from abroad to finance the war with Turkey, in 1922 Finance Minister Protopapadakis declared that each drachma was essentially to be cut in half. Half of the value of the drachma would be kept by the owner, and the other half would be surrendered by the government in exchange for a 20-year 6.5% loan. World War II led to these loans not being repaid, but even if the war had not occurred, it is doubtful that the Greek government would have been able to repay such enormous debts to its own populace. This strategy led to large revenues for the Greek state, and inflation effects were minimal.
This strategy was repeated again in 1926 due to the government's inability to pay back loans incurred from the decade of war and the resettlement of the refugees. Deflation occurred after this dichotomization of the drachma, as well as a rise in interest rates. These policies had the effect of causing much of the populace to lose faith in their government, and investment decreased as people began to stop holding their assets in cash which had become unstable, and began holding real goods.
Great Depression.
As the reverberations of the Great Depression hit Greece in 1932. The Bank of Greece tried to adopt deflationary policies to stave off the crises that were going on in other countries, but these largely failed. For a brief period, the drachma was pegged to the US dollar, but this was unsustainable given the country's large trade deficit, and the only long-term effects of this were Greece's foreign exchange reserves being almost totally wiped out in 1932. Remittances from abroad declined sharply and the value of the drachma began to plummet from 77 drachmas to the dollar in March 1931 to 111 drachmas to the dollar in April, 1931.
This has been particularly harmful to Greece as the country relied on imports from the UK, France and the Middle East for many necessities. Greece went off the gold standard in April 1932 and declared a moratorium on all interest payments. The country also adopted protectionist policies such as import quotas, which some European countries did during the time period. Protectionist policies coupled with a weak drachma, stifling imports, allowed Greek industry to expand during the Great Depression. In 1939 Greek Industrial output was 179% that of 1928.
These industries were for the most part "built on sand" as one report of the Bank of Greece put it, as without massive protection they would not have been able to survive. Despite the global depression, Greece managed to suffer comparatively little, averaging an average growth rate of 3.5% from 1932 to 1939. The fascist regime of Yannis Metaxas took over the Greek government in 1936, and economic growth was strong in the years leading up to the Second World War.
Shipping.
One industry in which Greece had major success was the shipping industry. Greece's geography has made the country a major player in maritime affairs from antiquity, and Greece has a strong modern tradition dating from the treaty of Kuchuk-Kajnardji in 1774, which allowed Greek ships to escape Ottoman domination by registering under the Russian flag. The treaty prompted a number of Greek commercial houses to be set up across the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, and after independence, Greece's shipping industry was one of the few bright spots in the modern Greek economy during the 19th century.
After both world wars the Greek shipping industry was hit hard by the decline in global trade, but both times it revived quickly. The Greek government aided the revival of the Greek shipping industry with insurance promises following the Second World War. Tycoons such as Aristotle Onassis also aided in strengthening the Greek merchant fleet, and shipping has remained one of the few sectors in which Greece still excels.
Tourism.
It was during the 60s and 70s that tourism, which now accounts for 30% of Greece's GDP, began to become a major earner of foreign exchange. This was initially opposed by many in the Greek government, as it was seen as a volatile source of income in the event of any political shocks. It was also opposed by many conservatives and by the Church as bad for the country's morals. Despite concerns, tourism grew significantly in Greece and was encouraged by successive governments as it was a straightforward source of badly needed foreign exchange revenues.
Agriculture.
The resolution of the Greco-Turkish War and the Treaty of Lausanne led to a population exchange between Greece and Turkey, which also had massive ramifications on the agricultural sector in Greece. The tsifliks were abolished, and Greek refugees from Asia Minor settled on these abandoned and partitioned estates. In 1920 only 4% of land holdings were of sizes more than , and only .3% of these were in large estates of more than . This pattern of small scale farm ownership has continued to the present day, with the small number of larger farms declining slightly.
Post-World War II.
Greece suffered comparatively much more than most Western European countries during the Second World War due to a number of factors. Heavy resistance led to immense German reprisals against civilians. Greece was also dependent on food imports, and a British naval blockade coupled with transfers of agricultural produce to Germany resulted in famine. It is estimated that the Greek population declined by 7% during the Second World War. Greece experienced hyperinflation during the war. In 1943, prices were 34,864% higher compared to those of 1940; in 1944, prices were 163,910,000,000% higher compared to the 1940 prices. The Greek hyperinflation is the fifth worst in economic history, after Hungary's following World War II, Zimbabwe's in the late 2000s, Yugoslavia's in the middle 1990s, and Germany's following World War I. This was compounded by the country's disastrous civil war from 1944 to 1950.
Greek economy was in a deplorable state in 1950 (after the end of the Civil War), with its relative position dramatically affected. In that year Greece had a per capita GDP of $1,951, which was well below that of countries like Portugal ($2,132), Poland ($2,480), and even Mexico ($2,085). Greece's per capita GDP was comparable to that of countries like Bulgaria ($1,651), Japan ($1,873), or Morocco ($1,611).
Over the past 50 years, Greece has grown much faster than most of the countries that had comparable per capita GDP's in 1950, reaching a per capita GDP of $30,603 today. This can be compared to the previously stated countries, $17,900 in Portugal, $12,000 in Poland, $9,600 in Mexico, $8,200 in Bulgaria and $4,200 in Morocco. Greece's growth averaged 7% between 1950 and 1973, a rate second only to Japan's during the same period. In 1950 Greece was ranked 28th in the world for per capita GDP, while in 1970 it was ranked 20th.
Culture.
Visual arts.
Modern Greek art began to be developed around the time of Romanticism. Greek artists absorbed many elements from their European colleagues, resulting in the culmination of the distinctive style of Greek Romantic art, inspired by revolutionary ideals as well as the country's geography and history. The most important artistic movement of Greek painting in the 19th century was academic realism (Greek academic art of the 19th century), often called in Greece "the Munich School" because of the strong influence from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Munich (), where many Greek artists trained. The Munich School painted the same sort of scenes in the same sort of style as Western European academic painters in several countries and did not attempt to incorporate Byzantine stylistic elements into their work. The creation of romantic art in Greece can be explained mainly due to the particular relationships that were created between recently liberated Greece (1830) and Bavaria during King Otto's years.
Notable sculptors of the new Greek Kingdom were Leonidas Drosis whose major work was the extensive neo-classical architectural ornament at the Academy of Athens, Lazaros Sochos, Georgios Vitalis, Dimitrios Filippotis, Ioannis Kossos, Yannoulis Chalepas, Georgios Bonanos and Lazaros Fytalis.
Theatre.
The modern Greek theatre was born after the Greek independence, in the early 19th century, and initially was influenced by the Heptanesean theatre and melodrama, such as the Italian opera. The Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù was the first theatre and opera house of modern Greece and the place where the first Greek opera, Spyridon Xyndas' "The Parliamentary Candidate" (based on an exclusively Greek libretto) was performed. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the Athenian theatre scene was dominated by revues, musical comedies, operettas and nocturnes and notable playwrights included Spyridon Samaras, Dionysios Lavrangas, Theophrastos Sakellaridis and others.
The National Theatre of Greece was founded in 1880. Notable playwrights of the modern Greek theatre include Gregorios Xenopoulos, Nikos Kazantzakis, Pantelis Horn, Alekos Sakellarios and Iakovos Kambanelis, while notable actors include Cybele Andrianou, Marika Kotopouli, Aimilios Veakis, Orestis Makris, Katina Paxinou, Manos Katrakis and Dimitris Horn. Significant directors include Dimitris Rontiris, Alexis Minotis and Karolos Koun.
Cinema.
Cinema first appeared in Greece in 1896 at the Summer Olympics, but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in 1907. In 1914 the "Asty Films Company" was founded and the production of long films begun. "Golfo" (Γκόλφω), a well known traditional love story, is the first Greek long movie, although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this. In 1931 Orestis Laskos directed "Daphnis and Chloe" ("Δάφνις και Χλόη"), contained the first nude scene in the history of European cinema; it was also the first Greek movie which was played abroad. In 1944 Katina Paxinou was honoured with the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for "For Whom the Bell Tolls".
The 1950s and early 1960s are considered by many as the Greek Golden age of Cinema. Directors and actors of this era were recognized as important historical figures in Greece and some gained international acclaim: Mihalis Kakogiannis, Alekos Sakellarios, Melina Mercouri, Nikos Tsiforos, Iakovos Kambanelis, Katina Paxinou, Nikos Koundouros, Ellie Lambeti, Irene Papas etc. More than sixty films per year were made, with the majority having film noir elements.
Notable films were "Η κάλπικη λίρα" (1955 directed by Giorgos Tzavellas), "Πικρό Ψωμί" (1951, directed by Grigoris Grigoriou), "O Drakos" (1956 directed by Nikos Koundouros), "Stella" (1955 directed by Cacoyannis and written by Kampanellis). Cacoyannis also directed "Zorba the Greek" with Anthony Quinn which received Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film nominations. Finos Film also contributed to this period with movies such as "Λατέρνα, Φτώχεια και Φιλότιμο", "Η Θεία από το Σικάγο", "Το ξύλο βγήκε από τον Παράδεισο" and many more.
The royal family.
Most members of the former royal family are living abroad; Constantine II and his wife, Anne-Marie and unmarried children resided in London until 2013 when they returned to Greece to reside permanently. As male-line descendants of King Christian IX of Denmark the members of the dynasty bear the title of "Prince or Princess of Denmark"; this is why they are traditionally referred to as Princes or Princesses of "Greece and Denmark".

Christian M. Nebehay

Christian M. Nebehay (May 11, 1909 – November 25, 2003) was an Austrian art dealer, art collector and author. He became internationally known – particularly in the art world – for his works on Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele.
Life and career.
Christian Nebehay was born in Leipzig, Germany, son of the art dealer Gustav Nebehay and his wife Marie (née Sonntag). In his early childhood he had made the acquaintance of the artist Gustav Klimt, a friend of his father's, who dedicated three of his drawings to the Nebehay family.
Nebehay, who established himself as the most important Klimt biographer, wrote numerous internationally acclaimed books discussing the lives and works of Klimt and his fellow artist, Schiele. In 1989, the "New York Times" described Nebehay's book "Egon Schiele: Sketchbooks" as "indispensable to any student of Schiele". The connection to Schiele and his artistic work had been drawn up by Nebehay's father Gustav as well: He had advised Schiele in commercial matters and in the run-up to exhibitions. As an Austrian Art Nouveau ("Jugendstil") expert, Nebehay was appreciated worldwide.
In 1980, he participated in the production of the movie "Schiele in Prison", produced by Emmy Award winner Mick Gold. He wrote screenplays for various Austrian TV documentaries, amongst others for "Gustav Klimt und seine Zeit" (1975) and for "Egon Schiele" (1976). Nebehay also advised Umberto II of Italy regarding the buildup of a collection of family portraits.
Artworks from Nebehay's gallery are exhibited at the world's most important museums today, e.g. at the National Gallery of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Museum of Modern Art.
Personal life.
Nebehay was first married to a niece of Katharina Schratt, Johanna Nebehay (née von Müller-Schratt), and later to the author Reneé Nebehay-King. Nebehay's son is married to Paula Molden, granddaughter of Paula von Preradović, the composer of Austria's national anthem, and niece of publisher Fritz Molden, whose wife had been former CIA director Allen W. Dulles' daughter Joan Dulles Molden.
Art gallery and foundations.
In 1947, Nebehay founded the Christian M. Nebehay Company (gallery, art shop and antiquarian bookstore) located in Vienna's first district. For decades he took over a leading role in the art and antique trade far beyond Austria. The shop continued even after his death. A former chairman of the Austrian League of Antiquarian Booksellers [Verband der Antiquare Österreichs] once referred to it as "the most important still active antiquarian bookstore of the 'Old Continent Europe. Nebehay, who served as president of the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers, also founded the Austrian League of Antiquarian Booksellers, which he headed for over two decades, and the Society of Friends of the Albertina. Nebehay was able to make numerous acquisitions in the interest of Austrian art, e.g. he initiated the purchase of the manuscript of Anton Bruckner's Third Symphony on behalf of the Austrian National Library. He also founded the Egon-Schiele-Museum in Tulln, Lower Austria.
Schiele auction record.
In 2007, selected works from Christian Nebehay's art collection were auctioned at Sotheby's in New York. The five drawings by Egon Schiele resulted in sales of US$17.9 million. The "Self-Portrait With Checkered Shirt" ("Selbstbildnis mit kariertem Hemd"), Schiele's last self-portrait on paper, came under the hammer for US$11.4 million. An auction record for a paper work by Egon Schiele was achieved.
Honors.
Nebehay received the Austrian Cross of Honor for Science and Art, First Class in 1994; he was named honorary member of the Association of Austrian Book Trade in 1984 and was appointed professor in 1978. He is also an honorary member of the Gustav Klimt Memorial Society.

Big Gold Dream

Big Gold Dream is a 2015 film documenting the story of Scotland’s post-punk scene, focusing on record labels Fast Product and Postcard Records. Directed by filmmaker Grant McPhee, the film’s name is taken from the 1981 Fire Engines single of the same name, the final release on the Pop Aural label.
The film won the 2015 Edinburgh International Film Festival Audience Award and was followed by another music documentary in 2017 called "Teenage Superstars", which was about acts associated with Creation Records and the 53rd &amp; 3rd label.
Overview.
Using a combination of interviews, archive material and specially-shot footage, the film traces the development of a post-punk scene in Scotland, tracing its roots in the punk explosion of 1977 and its effect on the Edinburgh music scene, with the emergence of bands such as Scars and The Dirty Reds and the appearance of record label Fast Product, which went on to release records by The Human League, The Mekons, Joy Division and Gang of Four. The film goes on to chart (and contrast) the rise and fall of Glasgow's poppier Postcard Records, home to Orange Juice and east-coast defectors, Josef K.
While primarily regarded as a music documentary, McPhee has stated that he sees Big Gold Dream as a study of creative autonomy and DIY culture:
“Despite its billing, this film is not a history of Scottish punk or independent music. It’s not really even that much about Scotland. It’s about young people taking control and expressing themselves creatively, without seeking permission from anyone in authority first – it just happens that those young people in our films chose post-punk music.”
Production.
Big Gold Dream took nine years to produce, with the first interviews filmed in 2006. McPhee attributes this to a dearth of available resources, stating that "in the early days things moved very slowly, equipment and time were expensive so we had to save up for a while to do each interview – and that was frustrating. Even a dozen interviews could take a couple of years." So much footage was captured over this period that a second documentary, Teenage Superstars, followed, following the story of the Scottish music scene from the mid-eighties to early nineties, including interviews with Teenage Fanclub's Norman Blake and Eugene Kelly of The Vaselines.
Release.
Big Gold Dream premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival on 19 June 2015, going on to show at Raindance, Belfast Film Festival, Leeds International Film Festival, Doc'n Roll Film Festival and Cambridge Film Festival. It was also included in the schedules of music festivals including The Great Escape, Indiepop NYC and Electric Fields.
Big Gold Dream received a television premiere on BBC Two on 15 April 2016.
Reception.
The film was roundly well-received, including 8/10 in Uncut, 4* in Mojo, 4* in Record Collector Magazine and 5* in Musikexpress, as well as positive reviews in the Scotsman and Louder than War.
Dazed and Confused named it one of the best music documentaries of 2015 and it was included in Sight &amp; Sound's best of 2015 list.
Big Gold Dream received its premiere at the 2015 Edinburgh International Film Festival on 19 June. Its screening saw it win the Audience Award. In Sight and Sounds Best Films of 2015 Poll it was voted 131 on the list. The film was self distributed on DVD via through Rough Trade and Love Music in 2017. After the film was screened on BBC 2 it led to a large amount of positive press in newspapers and online articles including Vice, Dazed and Pitchfork.
In May 2016 Big Gold Dream screened at a special event at New York University, Rough Trade NYC and The NYC Pop-Fest. For the occasion a commemorative cassette and limited edition screen-printed poster were created by Texte Und Tone. The cassette notes were an extended conversation between Michael Train and Michael Vazquez, who had programmed a continuous 96-hour broadcast of Scottish underground music during 1994, in Massachusetts.
Cherry Red Records released a five-CD box set, entitled Big Gold Dreams that acted as a tie-in with the film.
In October 2018 it was part of the National Museum of Scotland's 2018 Rip it Up exhibition where it screened at Edinburgh's Filmhouse.
Awards.
Big Gold Dream won the Edinburgh International Film Festival Audience Award in 2015.

Gu Cheng (Three Kingdoms)

Gu Cheng ( third century), courtesy name Zizhi, was a military general of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period of China.
Family background.
Gu Cheng's ancestral home was in Wu County, Wu Commandery, which is present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu. The Gu clan, which he was from, was one of the four most influential clans in Wu Commandery and also in the Jiangdong region at the time.
Gu Cheng's father, Gu Shao, served as the Administrator (太守) of Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi) under the warlord Sun Quan in the late Eastern Han dynasty. Gu Cheng's grandfather, Gu Yong, was the second Imperial Chancellor of the state of Eastern Wu, founded by Sun Quan in the Three Kingdoms period after the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty. Gu Cheng's mother was a sister of Lu Mao and Lu Xun, the third Imperial Chancellor of Eastern Wu.
Life.
Gu Cheng started his career in the Jiahe era (232–238) of Sun Quan's reign when he, along with his maternal uncle Lu Mao, were offered positions in the Eastern Wu government. Sun Quan wrote to Gu Cheng's grandfather Gu Yong: "Your grandson Zizhi is well known for his talent. After I met him, I realised that he is more talented than what I heard about him. You should be proud of him."
Sun Quan thus commissioned Gu Cheng as a Cavalry Commandant (騎都尉) and appointed him as a commander of the Yulin (羽林; "feathered forest") imperial guards. Gu Cheng was later reassigned to the position of Commandant of the West Section of Wu Commandery (吳郡西部都尉). During this time, he joined the Wu general Zhuge Ke in pacifying the rebellious Shanyue tribes and succeeded in recruiting 8,000 elite troops from among the Shanyue. After he returned to a garrison at Zhangkeng (章阬), he was promoted to the rank of General of the Household under the title "General of the Household of Righteous Illustriousness" (昭義中郎將). He was also concurrently appointed as a Palace Attendant (侍中).
In the summer of 241, the Wu general Quan Cong led Wu forces into battle at Quebei (芍陂; south of present-day Shou County, Anhui) against Wei forces led by Wang Ling. The battle did not go well for the Wu side initially, and they lost five units to the Wei forces. Gu Cheng and his friend Zhang Xiu, who were serving in the Wu army at the time, led their units to resist the Wei forces and managed to halt their advance. Quan Cong's eldest son Quan Xu (全緒) and relative Quan Duan (全端), who were also serving in the Wu army, led their troops to attack the Wei forces after they stopped advancing, and succeeded in driving them back.
After the battle, when Sun Quan was giving rewards to his officers, he deemed Gu Cheng and Zhang Xiu's contributions greater than those of Quan Xu and Quan Duan because he believed that it was more difficult to halt the enemy advance than to drive back the enemy. As a result, he promoted Gu Cheng and Zhang Xiu to the rank of General, while Quan Xu and Quan Duan were respectively promoted to Lieutenant-General and Major-General only. Due to this incident, the Quans bore a grudge against Gu Cheng and Zhang Xiu and, by extension, against Gu Cheng's brother Gu Tan as well. Gu Cheng held the rank of General under the title "General of Vehement Might" (奮威將軍) along with the appointment of Capital Superintendent (京下督).
The Quans later found an opportunity to report Gu Cheng, Zhang Xiu and Gu Cheng's brother Gu Tan for committing serious offences. They claimed that Gu Cheng and Zhang Xiu had secretly collaborated with Chen Xun (陳恂), a staff officer in the Wu army during the Battle of Quebei, to make false submissions about their contributions during the battle. As a result, Gu Cheng and Zhang Xiu were arrested and thrown into prison, while Gu Cheng's brother Gu Tan was implicated in the case because of his relationship with them. Sun Quan was reluctant to find them guilty so he thought of a plan to appease the Quans without convicting the Gu brothers and Zhang Xiu.
During an imperial court session, Sun Quan ordered Gu Tan to publicly apologise for the mistake. He expected Gu Tan to do so, after which he could then pardon and release the three of them. However, Gu Tan refused to apologise and he told Sun Quan: "Your Majesty, how can you let baseless accusations have their way?" Later on, an official accused Gu Tan of showing great disrespect towards the emperor when he protested his innocence, and argued that Gu Tan should be punished by execution. Sun Quan took into consideration that Gu Tan's grandfather Gu Yong had rendered meritorious service in the past, and decided to reduce Gu Tan's punishment from execution to exile.
Gu Cheng, along with his brother Gu Tan and Zhang Xiu, were exiled to the remote Jiao Province in the south. He died in exile in Jiaozhi (around present-day Hanoi, Vietnam) at the age of 36.

Mason Morgan

Mason Morgan is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera "Home and Away", played by Orpheus Pledger. The actor relocated to Sydney from Melbourne upon being offered the role. He began filming his first scenes in early December 2015. Pledger made his first appearance as Mason during the episode broadcast on 7 June 2016. 
Mason was introduced to the show along with his three older siblings; Tori Morgan (Penny McNamee), Justin Morgan (James Stewart) and Brody Morgan (Jackson Heywood). Mason is portrayed as being a positive, family orientated "free spirit". He is studying to be a doctor like his sister, who he shares a close bond with. For the first few weeks after their arrival, Mason and his siblings concealed the fact that they were in witness protection. Mason was the first member of the family to reveal the secret, which resulted in them being held hostage. 
Subsequent storylines for Mason have revolved around his romantic relationships with Evelyn MacGuire (Phillipa Northeast), Olivia Fraser Richards (Raechelle Banno), and Beth Ellis (Anneliese Apps), with the latter helping to bring awareness to organ donation in Australia. The character has also been used to show the effects of temporary paralysis, after he is injured in a car crash with his brother Brody. During the 2019 season finale, Mason is shot dead in a hospital siege.
Casting.
On 5 December 2015, Jonathon Moran from "The Daily Telegraph" reported actors Orpheus Pledger, Jackson Heywood and James Stewart had joined the cast of "Home and Away" as brothers Mason, Brody and Justin Morgan respectively. The family drew immediate comparisons to the show's Braxton brothers, who were introduced to the show in 2011. All three actors began filming their first scenes during the following week, ahead of their on-screen debut in 2016. Pledger was living with his mother and brother in Melbourne when he was offered the role of Mason, which required him to move to Sydney, where the show's studios are located. Pledger said his 2011 role as Noah Parkin on fellow Australian soap opera "Neighbours" helped him prepare for the workload and the pace of filming. Pledger made his first appearance on 7 June 2016, alongside Heywood and Stewart.
Development.
Characterisation and introduction.
Ahead of his screen debut, Pledger described Mason as having a "positive outlook on life", being family orientated, and "a hopeless romantic". He also said Mason "leads with his gut and stands up for what he believes in and will always stick up for the little guy." Pledger later called his character "a free spirit" and a positive person to be around. The actor explained that following the death of their parents, Mason's siblings helped him to grow up and unlike them, Mason has not had to take on many responsibilities. Of the comparisons to the Braxton brothers, Heywood said the Morgans had a different dynamic, while Pledger added that family comes first for the Morgans. Mason is a medical student, who struggles to fit in a social life in between studying and working out in the gym. Pledger called Tori a good role model for Mason and as a result, they share a very close relationship. 
Pledger shares some similarities with Mason, particularly his dedication to attaining his dream job. The actor explained, "I've done that in my life with acting. Maybe it's not the same formality as studying to be a doctor and having to do a seven-year introduction to it before you even start but, definitely, if I was passionate about it, I would definitely do it." The character's appearance changed in 2017 when Pledger shaved his "trademark" curly hair in favour of a shorter haircut. Pledger later said that he thought a shorter haircut was best for his character at that point, but that he was beginning to grow it longer for Mason again.
Mason, Justin and Brody, along with their dog Buddy, are almost involved in a car crash with Martin "Ash" Ashford (George Mason) while they are driving to Summer Bay to join their sister, Tori. Ash swerves across the road in front of them while texting. After coming to a stop, Justin immediately gets out of the car to confront Ash, and Brody and Mason desperately try to keep them from getting into a physical fight. The Morgans continue their journey to the Bay, where they find Ash talking with Tori and Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) on the beach and another fight almost breaks out, until Tori reveals that Justin, Brody and Mason are her brothers. Ash accepts that he was in the wrong, while Justin is glad his family have made it to the Bay safely. The siblings also wonder if they will be able to stay in their new home, leading to the start of their first major storyline.
Witness protection.
An "Inside Soap" columnist observed that the Morgans had been hiding something about their past from the Bay's residents. They initially keep to themselves and Justin warns Tori against befriending local doctor Nate Cooper (Kyle Pryor). Stewart explained that there were a set of rules that the Morgans had to live by, which related to their secret. While studying at home one day, Mason is visited by his former girlfriend Lara Adams (Elle Harris). Lara tells Mason off for not staying in contact with her. Justin arrives home shortly after and finds Lara and Mason together. He orders Lara to leave, while warning Mason that he has compromised the family. Stewart confirmed that Justin's reaction had something to do with the family's secret. Lara comes to the hospital to see Mason, who asks her to leave in case she is seen. Later, while he is looking for Lara, Mason comes across an upset Evelyn MacGuire (Philippa Northeast) and he comforts her. Lara sees them together and assumes Mason is also dating Evie. In an effort to reconnect with Lara, Mason tells her that his family are in witness protection. Later that day, Brody mentions that he is being followed, so Mason admits that he told Lara about their secret. Justin decides that they need to pack up and leave.
After Tori is threatened by Spike Lowe (Jason Montgomery), the family's police liaison officer Atticus Decker (John Adam) has them moved to a safe house. As they wait to find out where they will be moved to next, the family agree that they are tired of running from the people who killed their parents. When his siblings begin arguing, Mason slips outside to meet up with Lara. However, he soon learns that she is working for Spike and Blaine Varden (Ashley Lyons), the man who killed the Morgan's parents. Spike and Blaine trick Mason into telling them where the safe house is and they hold the family hostage. Blaine produces a gun and threatens to kill them all, before revealing that Justin knew the truth about the circumstances that led to their parents' deaths. Mason is one of nine characters involved in a plane crash, after Spike sabotages a plane being used for Tori's birthday trip. Justin attempts to warn the pilot, Duncan Stewart (Benedict Wall), but a broken pipe leaks carbon dioxide into the cabin and everyone passes out. However, Duncan does manage to crash land the plane in the sand first. While most of the passengers escape major injury, Mason is "panic-stricken" when he realises that Brody is missing.
Later developments in the storyline saw the Morgans meet Decker's nieces Hope (Jessica Falkholt) and Raffy Morrison (Olivia Deeble). They soon realise that Raffy could be their half-sister, after Decker admits to having an affair with their mother. A DNA test confirms their suspicions, but before they tell Raffy, Hope steals Mason's car and attempts to leave town with her. The Morgans eventually tell Raffy she is their half-sister and that they had to go into witness protection because their parents were killed by drug dealers. The Morgan's secret is soon revealed to the rest of the Bay in the local newspaper.
Relationships.
Evelyn MacGuire.
Mason shares a drunken kiss with Evie after a night out. The following week, they have dinner together and Mason confronts Evie about her drinking and partying. However, instead of talking to him about her issues, Evie just kisses Mason again and they have sex. They agree to a friends with benefits arrangement. Mason becomes concerned when Evie insists that she survived the plane crash because her deceased brother Oscar MacGuire (Jake Speer) is watching over her. Determined to prove her theory, Evie takes Mason out in her car and begins driving recklessly, as she is convinced that she will not crash. Mason is "petrified" by her stunt and when they stop, he "lets rip at her". Mason eventually develops feelings for Evie, but she reacts angrily to his admission and tells him she is not interested in a relationship with him. A reporter for "The Daily Telegraph" noted the arrangement would not last long, after Northeast was photographed filming a kissing scene with Alec Snow, who plays Matt Page.
Olivia Fraser Richards.
Producers later paired Mason with Olivia Fraser Richards (Raechelle Banno) and formed a love triangle storyline with her ex-boyfriend Hunter King (Scott Lee). Mason shows an interest in dating Olivia and she is "drawn to him". Pledger told Alison Gardner of "What's on TV" that Mason "really likes" Olivia and readily accepts her invitation to accompany her to the formal. The pair soon learn that Hunter is also attending, and Mason realises that Olivia still has feelings for him. Olivia leaves Mason at the bar and begins dancing with Hunter, but she explains that she was just passing the time while she waited for Mason to return. Pledger continued, "As the evening goes on, it's clear Olivia's still into Hunter. Mason's had so much to deal with because of his family's problems that he doesn't need Olivia to bring him even more heartache." The following morning, Olivia visits Mason at the lifeguard station, where he is starting his new job, to tell him that what happened with Hunter meant nothing, but Mason replies that he does not need any more stress in his life. Later that day, Mason gets into a fight with Hunter. Pledger said that Mason "acts completely out of character" when he hits Hunter and is left feeling ashamed after Alf breaks up the fight.
Olivia asks Mason if they can start their relationship over, but Mason rejects the idea. However, when they attend the Summer Grooves music festival, Mason and Olivia kiss. Olivia later admits to Mason that she is worried about Hunter's decision not to return to school and he attempts to talk to Hunter, as he is annoyed that she is worrying about him all the time. They pair have to separated by Alf again, and Lee commented that while Hunter does not have a friendship with Mason, he wants to get better at dealing with things. Mason and Olivia are soon caught having sex at the Summer Bay Auto garage by Brody and Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger). When Mason comes to The Diner to help Olivia out, he notices she is acting strangely. He soon learns from Alf that Hunter helped Olivia at The Diner the night before, leaving Olivia feeling guilty she did not tell Mason herself. Mason then confronts Hunter and asks him if he wants to get back together with Olivia, but Hunter says no. Mason and Olivia's relationship becomes strained as he worries that she still has feelings for Hunter, and when she admits that he is right, but wants to still date him, Mason breaks up with her.
Beth Ellis.
A new love interest for Mason was introduced in the form of guest character Beth Ellis (Anneliese Apps) in August 2017. Beth tells Mason that she is a nurse and they soon bond while he is a patient in the hospital. Beth's friendship helps Mason's recovery from injuries he sustained in a car crash. While looking for Beth, Mason soon learns that she is actually a patient. Mason is "furious" that Beth has lied to him, but she soon reveals that she is dying. Beth explains that she needs a heart transplant, after being diagnosed with a serious heart condition five years prior. Mason urges Beth not to give up hope that she will get the transplant and they share "a heartfelt moment", which led a "New Idea" columnist to speculate that they could be more than just friends. Mason later asks Beth out on a date and she accepts. Of their romance, Pledger told Tamara Cullen of "TV Week", "Beth brings out the best in Mason. He's playful and has no inhibitions with her." When Mason finds Beth's bucket list, she tells him that she accepts that she is not getting any better and is starting to reconsider her treatment. When Mason tries to reassure her that she will be fine, Beth gets angry and Mason is forced to apologise. He then surprises her with a champagne lunch, where they bond further and kiss. Pledger commented, "Mason has never had a connection with anyone else like this."
Mason finds Beth's bucket list and sees that she has fun and "romantically charged" things on it, which Mason wants to help her complete. Mason comes up with the idea of a James Bond style trip to the casino. During the journey, Beth passes out while she driving. Mason is "petrified" and worried about the harm to Beth's health. He is also left feeling helpless as he cannot do anything about her condition. Mason asks to meets Beth's parents, but she is reluctant. However, Mason later meets Beth and her father Alan Ellis (Blair McDonough) at the beach, so he introduces himself. Alan is unaware that his daughter is dating anyone, but he invites Mason to lunch with Beth and her mother Jackie (Rachael Coopes), where Mason tries to make a good impression. Both Apps and Pledger hoped Beth and Mason's storyline would raise more awareness about organ donation in Australia. Pledger also thought the plot could increase the number of people willing to be organ donors. Both actors found the storyline tough to film, with Pledger calling it "a harrowing experience". The storyline concludes with Beth's death. Mason wants to make the most of the time they have left and organises a lunch on the beach. But Beth collapses and Mason rushes her to the hospital, where she tells him she loves him. Beth goes into cardiac arrest and dies.
Paralysis.
Mason becomes a victim of his brother Brody's drug addiction when they are in a car crash together, which leaves him with temporary paralysis. The storyline begins when Mason finds Brody searching through the bin for drugs, as he is suffering a relapse. Mason knows that Brody needs help, so he manages to get Brody into his car to drive him to rehab. During the journey, Brody is convinced that his dealer William Zannis (Caleb Alloway) is following them. He suddenly grabs the wheel, causing the car to leave the road and crash. Brody suffers minor injuries, but Mason's condition deteriorates and he is placed in a coma after he loses the feeling in his hand. Tori is forced to tell Brody, Justin and Raffy that Mason may never walk again, as he has severe spinal damage. The diagnosis prompts Brody to sell his restaurant and leave town for a private rehab. Weeks later, Tori prepares to take Mason off the ventilator and wake him up, so she can assess how much damage there is to his spinal cord. But Mason fails to wake up and a neurosurgeon informs Tori that they will need to wait until the spinal shock has worn off. 
Days later, Mason finally wakes and is able to tell Tori that he cannot feel his legs. As he fears that he may never be able to walk again, Mason undergoes a series of tests and is told that once the swelling goes down, he may regain some feeling back. After Mason is discharged from the hospital, Brody attempts to apologise for causing the accident. Mason "erupts with fury" and attempts to strangle his brother. Justin and Tori try to get the brothers to reconcile, but they struggle to get through to "an increasingly-bitter" Mason. Justin later takes Mason to see their parents' graves to remind him that the family needs to stay together. Mason then accepts Brody's handshake, ending their feud. Pledger later posted a photo of himself walking around the outdoor set on his social media, confirming that Mason would recover from his paralysis.
Departure.
During the serial's season finale, broadcast on 27 November 2019, the character was killed off after being shot by a member of the Ouroboros gang, who had taken several characters hostage in the hospital. In an interview with "TV Week", Pledger confirmed that his departure was a joint decision between himself and the producers, saying "it was a creative decision because it benefits the show the most at this time. And it gave me a bit of time to prepare for a lot of things as well, so there was no stress. I mean it was just so good." Speaking about his final scenes, Pledger called Mason "heroic" and compared his death to an intense song, explaining that there was a lot of momentum and "a bit of a crescendo moment" when he was killed.

Leroy Vail (August 5, 1940 – March 27, 1999) whose birth name was Hazen Leroy Vail was an American specialist in African studies and educator who specialized in the history and linguistics of Central Africa and later extended his interests to Southern Africa. He taught in universities in Malawi, Zambia and the United States and his research in the first two countries inclined him toward the view that Central Africa underwent a period of underdevelopment that began in the mid-19th century and accelerated under colonial rule. After his return to the United States, he cooperated with Landeg White on studies of colonial Mozambique and on the value of African poetry and songs as a source of oral history.
Early life, education and family.
Hazen Leroy Vail, known throughout his adult life as Leroy Vail was born in Boston, Massachusetts on August 5, 1940, to parents of Canadian origin. His father, Hazen Claude Vail, from Belleisle, New Brunswick, moved to Boston as an adult and his mother, born Mary Teresa MacLean in Cape Breton Island, arrived there as a young girl. He had one younger brother, born in 1943.
Leroy grew up in the Allston neighbourhood of Boston, where he attended local public schools. In 1952, he was admitted to the Boston Latin School, graduating in 1958, and then entered Boston College to study Classics, but he changed to studying history after taking a sophomore course on medieval Europe, and graduated magna cum laude in history in 1962.
Vail attended graduate school at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, intending to study British imperial history under Philip Curtin. However, he quickly moved to the comparative tropical history program led by Curtin and Jan Vansina, where he studied African history and historical linguistics. He was awarded an M.A. in History in 1965, after which he was involved in Bantu language research at Madison, in its newly founded Department of African Languages and Literature.
Leroy married Patricia Ann Horochena, who held a master's degree in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin – Madison in 1967. In 1988 she and Vail took a Zambian girl, Sharon Mulenga, into their home as their daughter. Patricia Vail died on 26 February 2007.
In 1996 Vail suffered a massive heart attack but recovered and returned to work. However, he was later diagnosed with lymphoma which, in the autumn of 1998, spread uncontrollably. He died at his home in Concord on 27 March 1999.
Academic career.
In Africa.
Vail was awarded a one-year traveling fellowship by the University of Wisconsin in 1967 and decided to undertake research in Malawi. He became a Lecturer in History in the newly-founded University of Malawi and remained there until 1971. After leaving the country, he became a fierce critic of the regime of its first president, Hastings Banda.
In 1967–68 Vail began linguistic research among the Tumbuka people of northern Malawi, publishing his first article, "The Noun Classes of Tumbuka" in 1971 followed by later ones reinterpreting Tumbuka history and examining the operations of Portuguese companies in the lower Zambezi Valley of Mozambique. He returned to in Madison in 1971 to complete his doctoral thesis "Aspects of the Tumbuka Verb", which was accepted in 1972. He was unable to obtain an African History post in North America, so returned to Africa in 1973 as Senior Lecturer in History and African Languages in the University of Zambia, remaining there until 1978. During his time at this university, he organized an undergraduate course in African Languages and a Masters course in African History, and published several important articles on the history of Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique.
In the US.
Vail returned to the United States in 1978, and was visiting Associate Professor successively at Virginia for the 1978–79 academic year, UCLA, for 1979–80 and Ohio for 1980–81. He then gained a Research Fellowship on the Yale Southern African Research Program in 1981-82, returning to Virginia for the 1982–83 academic year. Meanwhile, his first book, "Capitalism and Colonialism in Mozambique" which he co-authored with Landeg White, was published. Its history was based on archival material and also on African women's songs that recorded the African suffering caused by Portuguese rule in the Lower Zambezi. In 1983, he organized a symposium for historians and anthropologists of southern Africa that investigated the historical nature of African ethnicities in a landmark collection, "The Creation of Tribalism in Southern Africa".
Vail became visiting Associate Professor of History at Harvard the spring term 1984, and received his first regular American academic appointment there later that year as Associate Professor of History, being given tenure in 1990, and becoming Chairman of the Committee on African Studies from then until 1995. His second book with Landeg White, "Power and the Praise Poem", was published in 1992. This argued that oral history was real history and that poets and their poetry for played a significant role in transmitting Southern African history. In 1994, after the Banda regime had ended, Vail returned to Malawi as a United Nations monitor for the elections of 1994.
Research interests.
Underdevelopment hypothesis.
In the 1970s, soon after many former African colonies had become independent, two different approaches were taken to the historical treatment of the period of colonial rule, in Malawi and elsewhere in Africa. One, the Nation-building concept saw the colonial period as an episode in building the post-colonial nation. This view weighed the benefits of the physical infrastructure and economic structures inherited by the new nation against colonial restrictions on African political and social advancement.
Vail questioned the basis of the evolutionary Nation-building scheme of interpretation and was a strong advocate of the concept of Underdevelopment in Central Africa. His attachment to this concept began with his research among what he called the dispossessed and atrociously exploited Tumbuka people. Vail saw underdevelopment as a step-by-step process of impoverishment and stagnation that started in the middle of the 19th century but accelerated under colonial rule. His theme, developed in four significant papers published between 1975 and 1981, was that the in Indian Ocean ivory and slave trades created a demand for imported goods among the people to the west of Lake Malawi in the late 18th and early 19th century and prompted social differentiation within their traditional societies. The mid-19th century incursion of Ngoni peoples into what is now the Northern Region of Malawi and Eastern Province of Zambia caused a further loss of status of among many indigenous groups, whose people become Ngoni serfs or refugees with limited access to land.
In Ngoni occupied areas.
The conversion of migratory Ngoni pastoralism into a mixed agricultural economy placed, in Vail's view, increasing pressure on subject peoples to produce more cereals, which provoked a series of revolts among these subjects in the 1870s. Vail believed that Ngoni practices of shifting or slash-and-burn cultivation and extensive cattle herding and their preference for living in large villages rather than in dispersed farmsteads, as the original inhabitants had done, caused overgrazing and the loss of soil fertility near the villages and the development of uncultivated bush in the areas between villages, into which wild animals carrying Tsetse fly moved and infected nearby cattle. In what became northern Nyasaland, revolts by the oppressed Tumbuka, ecological degradation and the famine it caused undermined the position of the local Ngoni king, Mbelwa.
These events predated any significant European presence in the area, but from the 1870s the African Lakes Company began to import European goods into the area and to transport young African men to work in European enterprises the south. Scottish Presbyterian missionaries also arrived in the area and Mbelwa, who had little power over influential Ngoni military leaders, sought an alliance with the missionaries to strengthen his position against those opponents that saw trying to accommodate the increasing European presence around the shores of Lake Malawi as a betrayal of traditional values. At first, Mbelwa saw Christianity and missionary education as more suitable for Tumbuka serfs than polygamous Ngoni warriors, and their first missions were in Tumbuka or Tonga areas, although he later saw the missionaries’ value for the northern Ngoni state.
Although Mbelwa's Ngoni retained their autonomy until 1904, Vail considers that their social and economic position and those of the Tumbuka were weakened as previous relatively egalitarian class systems became more unequal when they were drawn into the capitalist economy. The Ngoni in North-Eastern Rhodesia lost most of their cattle, representing their wealth, in the rinderpest epidemic of the early 1890s and many of their remaining cattle were seized by British South African Company forces which conquered the Ngoni in that area later in the decade. Restrictions on Africans possessing guns for hunting elephants and other wild animals deprived them, in Vail's view, of sources of income and meat, and the imposition of a hut tax and land expropriation in Northern Rhodesia in the first decade of the 20th century further impoverished this area.
According to Vail, the Ngoni invasions and the advent of colonial rule had created the so-called "Dead North" in Nyasaland and impoverishment around Chipata in North-Eastern Rhodesia. The colonial policies in these areas and in Mozambique resulted in leaving local African men at best little choice but become labor migrants and at worst in their forced recruitment for the mines, farms and other employers of Southern Rhodesia and South Africa. He considered that the absence of many able-bodied men restricted the ability of those women, youths and older men remaining to produce food or cash crops, and European farmers discouraged the growth of cash crops that might compete with them. As a result of these policies, Vail believed that, for the forty years until 1939, the people the British colonies were impoverished and exploited and that post-World War II policies came too late to make good the damage caused
Nyasaland's railways.
Although Pachai strongly believed that the development of Nyasaland's railways was a positive contribution by the British government to the protectorate's development, Vail considered that the policies of the British government and the local colonial administration turned Nyasaland into an "Imperial Slum" and a labor reserve for Southern Rhodesia and South Africa. He argued the country's economy was burdened by heavy debts arising from colonial railway construction, which he considered was designed to benefit British companies and interests at the expense of Nyasaland and which hindered its economic development. Initially, the landlocked protectorate was reached from the Indian Ocean along the Zambezi and Shire rivers, which were free of customs dues to international traffic, but falling Shire river levels in the early 20th century created difficulties in maintaining a continuous service. The first railway project was to link the most developed part of the country, the Shire Highlands, to a suitable river port, although this line had to be extended southward as water levels in the Shire continued to fall, and it eventually reached the Zambezi. A railway from Beira in Mozambique to Salisbury in Southern Rhodesia had been opened in 1899 and, after a possible alternative rail route from Quelimane toward the Nyasaland border stalled after the First World War, the British government was under pressure from British-owned companies to link Nyasaland's railways to this line.
Although, as Vail stated, the primary benefit of the Beira route did not accrue to Nyasaland, the protectorate was expected to pay interest and repay capital on loans for the construction of the railway link and the Dona Ana Bridge over the Zambezi out of the expected increase in government revenues. By 1935, the country was liable to repay debts of £5.1 million. Vail also notes that the colonial administration abandoned development plans in the 1930s, attributing this to its indebtedness rather than the Great Depression in general. He suggested that this debt burden left its government with insufficient funds to promote the growing of exportable crops by African farmers. The high freight charges levied by the railways to Beira were a further disincentive to agricultural development and forced protectorate to rely on exporting migrant labor, so producing widespread slum-like conditions and making it little more than a labor reserve.
Creation of tribalism.
In the 1980s, Vail considered the historical background to the creation of ethnicity and the resurgence of tribalism in Central and Southern Africa. His experience in Malawi suggested to him that, in the late 1960s shortly after the independence of several former colonies, there was a revival of the ethnic and regional consciousness that had been established earlier in the 20th century, but which became less prominent during struggles for independence. This revival reflected the artificial origin of most post-colonial African states and their rapid adoption of one-party rule: the development of regionalism and tribalism was a reaction to the dominant party trying to impose a false unity on the existence of ethnic diversity.
Vail did not accept, as other authors had claimed, that ethnicity resulted from the colonial powers’ divide-and-rule tactics, from the rigid classification of African peoples into fixed tribes by European anthropologists or when previously isolated rural groups came together and into conflict in urban or industrial settings. He also questioned whether the growth of ethnic particularism was related to uneven development in colonial times that gave some groups better access to education and employment, or to the creation of myths regarding ancestral political structures that were disrupted in the colonial era.
Although accepting that all these explanations might have some validity, Vail considered them unhistorical and pointed to the impoverishment of Central and Southern Africa in the late 19th and early 20th century through ecological catastrophes such as the rinderpest epidemic, disease, locusts and famine, colonial land expropriation and taxes and labor migrancy, all of which amounted to African people losing control of their lives. He believed that the decline of traditional power systems and the growth of both European organized and African initiated churches gave rise to new identities that, for European missionaries or anthropologists or educated Africans themselves, were ethnic identities, each with its language, often fixed by missionaries for used in education, and a rediscovered or manufactured history and traditions.
In the decade following independence in 1964, political views in Malawi were frequently expressed in ethnic terms, and groups that had prospered under the colonial regime were stigmatized as being unfaithful to the country's Chewa culture which the ruling party and president promoted. Before the ratification of a British protectorate over what became Nyasaland, there were many ethnic groups in the area. Missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries homogenized the various local dialects into a relatively small number of standardized languages, so that the Tumbuka language became the medium of teaching in the north of the country, the Chewa language in the centre and Nyanja and Yao languages in the south. The Chewa and Nyanja languages are closely related and the official standard was called Chinyanja until 1968, when the president of Malawi Hastings Banda, who came from the predominantly Chewa Central Province insisted on it being called Chichewa.
The education provided by Scottish-run missions at several sites in the Northern Province of Nyasaland was superior to that found in most other parts of the protectorate, although other Scottish missionaries at Blantyre Mission also provided educational advancement for some southerners. Those that these missions trained became an educated African elite, who found employment as teachers, in the civil service or in commerce, and whose political aim was African advancement to higher positions in the administration and to obtain a political voice. In contrast, the Yao in the south, including many Muslims debarred from Christian education, and the Chewa in the centre, where fewer missions were founded, were more resentful of the intervention of the colonial state and protective of their traditional culture than motivated by political aspirations.
Many of the leading figures in the Nyasaland African Congress in the late 1950s and early 1960s were Tumbuka speaking northerners or graduates of Blantyre Mission and, in 1963, in preparation for independence, these took a majority of the ministerial posts in Banda's government. Shortly after independence, in the 1964 Cabinet Crisis, the rejection of their demand for more rapid Africanisation, a key aim of the mission-educated elite, led to their resignation or sacking and, in most cases, their exile. In the aftermath of this, Banda purged their supporters from positions of influence and replaced them with Chewa nominees from the Central Region, at the same time promoting the Chewa culture as the only authentic Malawian culture. In addition to renaming the Chinyanja language Chichewa in 1968, Tumbuka was abolished as an official language and the medium of instruction in the Northern Region in the same year, and examination results and the secondary school entrance system were manipulated to assist candidates from the Central Region and disadvantage those from the Northern Region.
Later interests.
Towards the end of his career, Vail widened his interests, including a return to studying Bantu linguistics and at the time of his death, he had four books in progress, three on Central Africa "Spirits, Women, and Deprivation," in Malawi and Zambia since 1850, a dictionary of Lakeside Tonga, and "Ideophones as stylistic devices in Tumbuka", the fourth was on "ethnogenesis"in modern Togo. It is possible that his dictionary of Lakeside Tonga may be published in the future.
Alternative views.
Vail's research was regarded as innovative when published, but his views in three areas have been reassessed by other scholars or modified by later research: the extent of ecological damage caused by African agricultural practices, the degree of compulsion involved in labor migration and its overall effects, and the cost to Nyasaland of its colonial era railways. Two more recent assessments are that British rule was a mixed blessing for many of the peoples of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, as it brought an end to warfare and slave raiding, yet redirected much of their productive labor toward the capitalism of the south, and that many labor migrants travelled south clandestinely, ignoring governmental restrictions, in search of financial security; although many were exploited, others achieved modest prosperity after their return from their savings out of higher wages earned abroad.
Environmental degradation.
Much of Vail's account of environmental degradation in Northern Nyasaland is based on the views of 19th century missionaries who regarded Ngoni farming practices as environmentally destructive, wasteful and therefore morally wrong, and also the attitudes of colonial officials from the 1930s onward who accepted the missionaries' views without any supporting empirical evidence. Read regarded the Ngoni as having an efficient agricultural system based on the labor of their serfs, and accounts from the 1870s to 1890s mention extensive cultivation and cattle herding, and the apparent health and prosperity of the Ngoni people.
The main objection of missionaries and colonial officials was to the Ngoni shifting or slash-and-burn cultivation, which a few tropical agriculturalists from the 1950s began to recognize them as sympathetic to the environment, and which many modern-day tropical agriculturalists consider may be more efficient than fixed cultivation of many tropical soils. Vail expressly rejected Read's views, claiming she had been misadvised by Ngoni informants, but he did not consider the efficiency or otherwise of slash-and-burn cultivation. Recent research supports Read's views, showing that, in 1998, most soils in Malawi were adequate for growing maize, as fertility had declined much less rapidly than forecast between the 1930s and 1950s.
Labor migration.
Vail's suggestions that the forced recruitment of labor and the forced consumption of foreign goods were imposed on the Tumbuka and Ngoni in northern Nyasaland in the later 19th century, or that other African men in Nyasaland, eastern Northern Rhodesia or Mozambique had little or no option but to become labor migrants seem overstated. The first labor migrancy from the area between the north-western shores of Lake Nyasa and the Luangwa valley predated these areas becoming British dependencies, and was initially directed to the Shire Highlands. However, in the mid to late 1890s, some workers travelled voluntarily to Southern Rhodesia and South Africa where wages were much higher.
Rather than consistently promoting labor migration, the Nyasaland government opposed all migration of workers outside the protectorate before 1903 and from 1913 to 1936 and, when it did allow migrancy, the government insisted on enforcing controls on the numbers recruited by licensed labor organizations and a system of deferring part of the men's pay until they returned to Nyasaland. However, many workers left independently, disregarding government restrictions and licensed recruiters For much of the first half of the 20th century, there was a debate on whether Nyasaland should have as its main economic function agriculture on European owned estates, peasant cash-crop production or the supply of migrant labor. Although labor migration was predominant in the Northern Province of Nyasaland and Eastern Province of Northern Rhodesia, regarding them simply as labor reserves ignores the increasing importance of peasant cash crop production in these areas and government attempts to find suitable cash crops which could replace migrant laboring as the main source of local cash incomes. Peasant cash-crop production in Nyasaland's Central Province and this together with agriculture on European-owned estates in the Southern Province were far more important than labor migration to their local economies and that of Nyasaland as a whole in the colonial period.
Vail and White considered that the colonial administration of Mozambique pressured local Africans into migrant labor by discouraging them from growing cash crops and requiring them to engage in productive labor. However, Penvenne argued that Vail and White did not clearly distinguish between coercive labor conscription for work within Mozambique and migrant labor recruitment, where workers actively sought higher wages outside its territory. This external migrant labor was voluntary and often the subject of disapproval by officials or companies based in Mozambique.
Railway finance.
Vail's argument that the cost of railway links impoverished Nyasaland, preventing the government from promoting efficient peasant agriculture has also been questioned. The Nyasaland government only had to pay interest and repay capital on the loans for constructing the Trans-Zambezia Railway or Zambezi Bridge if its revenues exceeded target figures. During the period 1930 to 1947, it only paid interest in 1936 and repaid no capital, and all the accrued debt liabilities passed to the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953. Rather than draining Nyasaland's admittedly meagre public funds, as Vail suggests, the railway and Zambezi Bridge cost it relatively little and provided a more effective, if underutilized, link to the outside world than the previously used option of river transport.
Although Vail mentions that various development projects were shelved in 1935, he does not provide a direct link between this and the increased public debt. A more detailed review of the Nyasaland government's actual revenue and expenditure in the 1929 to 1939 Great Depression showed that revenue was maintained in the first part of that decade and rose in the second half, and that ordinary government expenditure rose by 50% in the period, with significant increases in Social Services and Natural Resources spending and staff, although the amounts were small.

Dermod MacCarthy

Dermod de la Chevallerie MacCarthy FRCP (15 March 1911 – 12 July 1986) was a British-born paediatrician, notable for establishing a paediatric unit at Stoke Mandeville Hospital and conducting research into common disturbances in childhood and growth in deprived children. He was most notable for his work to encourage mothers to be with their children when in hospitals.
Life.
MacCarthy was the son of Sir Desmond MacCarthy, the foremost literary and dramatic critic of his day, and of Mollie Warre Cornish, the daughter of a vice-provost of Eton College. An author in her own right, Cornish wrote "A Nineteenth-century childhood" in 1924. MacCarthy was educated at Gresham's School and upon finishing his education there began to train as a physician at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, where he qualified in 1934. MacCarthy took up a number of positions in medicine, before becoming a ship's doctor on a vessel travelling to the Far East.
In 1947, he married Marie-France Geoffroy-Dechaume, whom he had known since childhood, but it was only when MacCarthy was in his mid thirties that romance blossomed. During World War II, Geoffroy-Dechaume joined the French Resistance and was awarded the Croix-de-Guerre for heroism in her active service against the enemy.
Career.
Before the Second World War, MacCarthy had already decided to specialise and to become a paediatrician, and by the start of the war was working in Great Ormond Street Hospital. He became a Resident at about the time of the start of the Blitz, and some of his earliest duties included organizing the evacuation of children from the hospital to outlying and countryside hospitals. In 1942, he joined the Royal Naval Reserve and served as a surgeon, with the rank of Lieutenant, continuing to hold a commission until 1946.
At the beginning of the National Health Service in 1948, the idea of Pediatrics, as a profession was still very new. Indeed, the word itself was barely known, and hardly in use, outside the medical community in the United Kingdom. During that period, at the end of 1940s, paediatricians were establishing children's units across the country. MacCarthy was selected to establish a series of children's wards, working initially in Aylesbury and then putting in units across the whole of Buckinghamshire, a task he continued to work on until 1976.
MacCarthy's main contribution to paediatrics was made in the 1950s, when a movement arose to enable parents to visit their children in hospital, when they were convalescing. This movement was launched by a paper written by the paediatrician James Spence called "The Case of Children in Hospital" in which he argued that the parent should nurse and feel responsible for the child patient's recovery. Before this movement, visiting by parents was usually restricted and sometimes forbidden in certain hospitals. MacCarthy helped facilitate the movement by making an influential film with James Robertson, the second in the series, called Going to hospital with mother The film was filmed in the children's ward of Amersham Hospital. MacCarthy later worked as an advisor to the newly established National Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital. The paper written by Spence, and work done by MacCarthy and others, led to the creation of the Platt Report, which ultimately recognized that:
In 1974, MacCarthy became president of the paediatric section of the Royal Society of Medicine, while also a consultant paediatrician to the Institute of Child Psychology in London. During 1975, he was elected president of the Confederation of European Societies of Paediatricians.
Awards.
In 1982, MacCarthy received the prestigious James Spence Medal, named after Professor Sir James Calvert Spence, and is the highest award of the British Paediatric Association.

Fulbourn Manor is a Grade II listed building in the county of Cambridgeshire and the sole surviving manor of the Five Manors of Fulbourn.
History.
It was built in 1788 or maybe earlier. An account from 1495 states that Richard Berkeley and his wife Anne Berkeley settled a debt of 1,000 marks with four manors of Fulbourn, which were stated as Zouches, Manners, Shardelowes and Fulbourn.
It was largely rebuilt around 1910 by Dudley Newman. Reconstruction preserved part of the 18th century building.

Sônia Guajajara

Sônia Bone de Souza Silva Santos (born 6 March 1974), usually known as Sônia Guajajara, is a Brazilian indigenous activist, environmentalist, and politician. A member of the leftist Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL), she was initially a candidate for President of Brazil in the 2018 election, before being chosen as the vice presidential running mate of nominee Guilherme Boulos. This made her the first indigenous person to run for a federal executive position in Brazil. 
Early life.
Sônia Guajajara was born to a Guajajara family on Araribóia Indigenous Land (), located in the Amazonian rainforest in the northeastern state of Maranhão. At the age of 15, she left home at the invitation of FUNAI and moved to Minas Gerais, where she completed her initial education at an agricultural boarding school. 
Guajajara became interested in politics at a very young age, and stated "I was born an activist. I’ve spent my whole life fighting against anonymity, against indigenous peoples’ invisibility. I always wanted to find a path, a way to bring the history and way of life of the indigenous people to light for society as a whole."
Guajajara would later attend the Federal University of Maranhão, located in the state capital of São Luís. Guajajara additionally holds a master’s degree in culture and society from the Institute of Humanities, Arts, and Culture at the Federal University of Bahia. Following graduation, Guajajara worked in a variety of professions, including as a teacher and as a nurse.
Activism and honors.
Guajajara is the leader of the "Articulação dos Povos Indígenas do Brasil" (Articulation of the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil, or "APIB"), an organization that represents around 300 indigenous ethnic groups in Brazil. 
As an activist, she has been at odds with the "ruralistas" in the National Congress, a group of conservative legislators allied with agribusiness interests who favor further development on public lands.
Guajajara strongly opposes efforts to contact uncontacted peoples in the Amazon Rainforest. Guajajara has described President Jair Bolsonaro as "a threat to the planet" due to his deforestation policies. In 2020, she called for urgent environmental action amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
During her time as an activist, she has organized a number of demonstrations in support of indigenous rights in Brazil, and facilitated a meeting of indigenous leaders with then-President Dilma Rousseff in 2013. In 2015, she was named to the Brazilian Ordem do Mérito Cultural. She was also awarded a medal by Maranhão state.
Political career.
Party politics.
Guajajara became a member of the Workers' Party (PT), the left-wing party that ruled Brazil from 2003 to 2016, in 2000. In 2011, Guajajara left the party due to its alliance with Roseana Sarney, a conservative politician who served as Governor of her home state of Maranhão. She later joined the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL), a socialist party initially founded by PT dissidents.
In the run-up to the 2014 presidential election, Guajajara criticized the presidency of Dilma Rousseff in an interview, stating that the "Dilma government was very bad for us". In the same interview, she also cautioned against the election of a right-wing Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) to the presidency. Despite her misgivings, Guajajara denounced the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff that led to the installation of Michel Temer as President, describing it as a "coup".
2018 presidential election.
In 2018, Guajajara announced her intention to run for President of Brazil as a member of PSOL. Her candidacy was backed by the support of the ecosocialist wing of the party. In the end, she was chosen by labor leader Guilherme Boulos to serve as his vice presidential running mate on the PSOL ticket. Guajajara was the first indigenous person to run for a federal executive office in Brazil.

Swiss Research Centre for Rationalization in Building and Civil Engineering CRB

Since its formation in 1959, the Swiss Research Centre for Rationalization in Building and Civil Engineering or CRB (the abbreviation stems from the original French name "Centre Suisse d’études pour la Rationalisation du Bâtiment", now "Centre suisse d'études pour la rationalisation de la construction") has worked to improve communication within the Swiss construction sector. In close collaboration with the professional and trade associations, CRB acts on behalf of the Swiss construction industry in developing standard tools for use across the entire life cycle of buildings – from design and construction to facility management. Adopting a uniform system structure and terminology, these tools facilitate the collaboration between clients, designers, contractors and suppliers, and provide the foundation for digitization in construction.
History and organization.
Organized in the legal form of an "association" (under the Swiss Civil Code), CRB has some 5,000 members throughout Switzerland. It was formed in 1959 by the Federation of Swiss Architects (). Other supporting bodies now include the Swiss Society of Engineers and Architects () and the Swiss Contractors' Association (). Today, all the Swiss construction industry's key associations and organizations are represented on the Board and support CRB's operations. CRB now has around 70 employees, who work at its offices in Zurich, Fribourg and Bellinzona. Moreover, each year, up to 400 construction professionals and practitioners are mandated to carry out work for CRB.
National and international networking.
CRB collaborates closely with numerous construction-sector associations and organizations within Switzerland. To ensure that users can reap the full benefits of standardization and rationalization, now and in the future, subjects such as building information modelling (BIM) and digitization figure prominently in CRB's development work. CRB is a member of the following organizations:
• netzwerk_digital: CRB's remit within this association, which supports and promotes the co-ordinated development of digitization in Switzerland, is standardization. Other members include SIA, the Co-ordination Conference for Federal Construction and Real Estate Authorities () representing public-sector clients, the Private Professional Owners Interest Group (IPB) and "Bauen digital Schweiz" (Swiss Digital Construction).
• buildingSMART International
• International Construction Information Society (ICIS)
Core business.
CRB's best-known tools are the Catalogue of Standard Descriptions (NPK) construction specification system, the Building Cost Classification (BCC) and two further, element-based cost classifications (eBKP-H and eBKP-T), all of which are available in German, French and Italian. CRB also has the exclusive rights in Switzerland for distribution of the Swedish-developed Natural Colour System (NCS). NCS is the only colour system to describe colours in the same way as they are perceived by the human eye. 
The Catalogue of Standard Descriptions specification system now comprises over one million brand- and product-neutral work items from the fields of building construction, civil engineering (incl. tunnelling) and building services. It allows the systematic preparation of consistent, detailed and clearly worded specifications for construction works. It is cross-linked to the cost planning and monitoring tools, and forms the basis for digital data exchange. The prd.crb.ch construction product platform provides construction professionals and practitioners with valuable product and manufacturer information. 
The production- or trade-oriented Building Cost Classification (BCC) is used by designers, contractors, clients and investors as a common basis for the uniform presentation of cost information. CRB has also produced two element-based cost classifications, the eBKP-H (for building construction) and eBKP-T (for civil engineering). These boost efficiency in cost planning by helping to identify those building elements with the highest costs and greatest optimization potential.

VC Radiotechnik

Volleyball Club Radiotechnik () is a former Soviet club and after 1991 Latvian, based in Riga. During the seventies it rose to the European limelight thanks to the victory of 3 continental trophies, under the name Elektrotechnika.
History.
The debut of the club in the Soviet championship dates back to 1947, but the first notable result is the second place in 1960. From that moment on, the team was one of the strongest players in the Soviet volleyball scene. From 1973 to 1983 it never dropped below the 5th place, and during that decade it was able to establish itself in Europe thanks to the victory of 3 CEV Cup Winners' Cups, two of which back to back. In 1984 the club achieved the maximum milestone in its history: It won the championship title, succeeding in the task of interrupting the streak of 14 consecutive titles of CSKA Moscow.
After the Champion title of the Soviet Union Electrotechnika participated in the CEV European Champions Cup in 1985, where it was eliminated in the quarterfinals by future champions of Santal Parma. After placing third in the 1990 and 1991 editions of the Soviet championship, in 1992 dominated the Latvian newborn championship, created because of the collapse of the Soviet Union. The last great achievement of the club was the winning of the CEV Cup final in 1991 (then the third continental trophy). Also this was the time to defeat by another famous Italian club, Sisley Treviso.

Call the Comet

Call the Comet is the third studio album by the English musician Johnny Marr. It was released on 15 June 2018 by New Voodoo and Warner Bros. Records.
Critical reception.
"Call the Comet" received generally positive reviews from music critics upon its release. At "Metacritic", which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album scored an average rating of 78, based on 16 reviews. Writing for the Associated Press, Mark Kennedy opined that it was "easily his best as a solo artist, deep and rich both musically and lyrically" before concluding, "So feel free to stay in bed, Morrissey. Marr is who we need now." Writing for "Hot Press", Edwin McFee rated the album 8 out of 10. "MusicOMH" contributor Neil Dowden awarded the album 4 out of 5 stars, calling it Marr's "most ambitious and interesting work under his own name". Creative Loafing contributor Gabe Echazabal rated it 4.5 out of 5, writing, "Call the Comet is, simply put, Marr's strongest solo effort. It's a magnificent piece of work that serves as a true testament to the idea that Marr has plenty to offer musically at this stage of his career, and it clearly showcases his continued and ever-present vitality." Clash Music contributor Will Rosebury rated the album 7/10 and called it "easily Johnny Marr’s most confident solo album".
Robert Steiner of "The Boston Globe", however, disagreed with those other critics, starting his review by writing that Marr's time with the Smiths cemented his legacy as one of rock's greatest sidemen, "[b]ut that's the key word: "sidemen"." He went on to write that Marr is at his best working with other creative minds and all he does as a solo artist is "produce groggy rehashes of old Brit-rock tropes he helped create three decades ago." He concluded his review by stating "Call the Comet" could be a passable album if it was the work of a young band rather than someone "who inspired guitarists in some of those bands to pick up their instruments in the first place."
Writing for "Pitchfork", contributor Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave a more mixed rating of 6/10, writing that after spending "a quarter-century as a hired gun, roaming from project to project", Marr "is starting to slow down in his middle age".

Towneley Colliery

Towneley Colliery or Towneley Desmesne was a coal mine on the Burnley Coalfield in Burnley, Lancashire, England. Sunk in the late 1860s, it was linked to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Burnley to Todmorden line which became known as the Copy Pit route and, by tramway, to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.
Towneley Colliery was sunk next to Brooks and Pickup's fireclay works less than a half mile from Towneley railway station which served Towneley Hall. Brooks and Pickup began coal production from the main shaft, the Alice Pit in late February 1869. For 75 years coal was extracted from the Arley, Dandy, King and Yard mines. The colliery had sidings on either side of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Burnley to Todmorden line, the Copy Pit route. A half-mile long tramway linking it to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal had four tunnels. Boggart Brig Pit beside the A671 Todmorden Road was linked by a tramroad and was also linked underground. The pit was also linked underground to Bank Hall Colliery a half mile distant.
In 1923 the colliery was owned by Brooks &amp; Brooks Collieries and employed 770 men working the colliery which included the Towneley Drift. In 1933 the Towneley Coal &amp; Fireclay Company employed 672 men, 480 of them underground. The colliery produced fireclay as well as coal used for household and manufacturing use, coking and for producing gas.
The colliery was nationalised in 1947 after which the National Coal Board worked the Yard, Dandy and Lower Mountain mines. Its satellite pits, Dyneley Knoll (), Boggart Brig () and Park Pits () closed in 1947 and were abandoned in 1949. The colliery closed on 6 March 1949. Its shafts were used for pumping until 1971 when Bank Hall Colliery closed. Little remains of the colliery, a residential development occupies a small part of the site and the rest comprises steep, mossy hillocks and woodland. A small replica brick kiln was built on a hillock to commemorate the colliery's brickworks.

Ahmed Samy

Ahmed Samy (, born 31 March 1992) is an Egyptian footballer who plays for Pyramids as a Centre-back.
Club career.
Early career.
Samy started his career at El Khatib Football Academy, after playing well and showing great discipline in the Pepsi Schools League. Before participating in the Pepsi Schools League he had a trial with Egyptian giants Al Ahly youth team, but failed to pass all tests because of an injury.
After staying with El Khatib Football Academy for almost 4 years, he was signed by Al Nasr at the age of 15.
Al Nasr.
Samy played 2 seasons with the reserve team before being promoted to the first team in 2009, which was playing in the Egyptian Second Division at that time. He helped the club in reaching the quarter-final of Egypt Cup during the 2010–11 season for the first time in the club's history, but they were eliminated in that round by defending champions Haras El Hodoud after losing 0–1 at extra time. Because of his great performance with the club, Telephonat Beni Suef announced the signing of the player for an undisclosed fee.
Telephonat Beni Suef.
On 1 July 2012, Samy was transferred to newly-promoted team Telephonat Beni Suef. This was considered as the first season for the club at the Egyptian Premier League, because after the club gained promotion to the 2011–12 Egyptian Premier League by winning the 2010–11 Egyptian Second Division, the season was suspended in February 2012 and all league results were halted due to the incidents that occurred during the Port Said Stadium riot.
The next season, 2011–12 Egyptian Premier League, wasn't much different; as the Egyptian Premier League, alongside all other sport-related activities in Egypt, were cancelled and all results were halted in July 2013 for security reasons due to the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état.
Things became a bit stable 2013–14 Egyptian Premier League, but because the season started on 26 December 2013 the Egyptian Football Association decided to split the teams in two groups to make sure that the season will end in July 2014. Samy had a decent season with club, he scored 1 goal and missed only 3 matches in the season. The club finished 9th in Group B and lost the relegation play-off against El Raja and were relegated to the Egyptian Second Division. A lot of clubs wanted to sign Samy after the season ended, including Al Ahly, Ismaily and Misr Lel Makkasa. After Ehab Galal, who managed Telephonat Beni Suef in the 2013–14 season, was appointed as manager of Misr Lel Makkasa; Samy ended up joining Misr Lel Makkasa too after he was convinced by Galal to join him with his new club.
Misr Lel Makkasa.
On 3 August 2014, Misr Lel Makkasa completed the signing of Samy in a 3-year contract alongside some of his teammates at Telephonat Beni Suef, including future club star Ahmed El Sheikh.
 Samy made his official debut in the first match of the 2014–15 Egyptian Premier League season in a 2–1 win against El Raja, playing the full 90 minutes in that match. Samy became an important player in the team quickly, and played 35 official matches in his first season with the club, including 32 in the league. After a great first season, the club finished fourth in the league and qualified for the 2016 CAF Confederation Cup, their first ever appearance in an African competition.
Samy maintained his first-eleven place for the 2015–16 Egyptian Premier League after gaining his manager's trust after his performance in the previous season. In the 2015–16 season he played 29 league matches and scored 2 goals, against Ittihad El Shorta in a 1–1 draw in the first match of the season and against league champions Al Ahly in a 0–1 away win. Despite his performance, the club didn't do well in local competitions as they finished 10th in the league and got eliminated from the 2015–16 Egypt Cup in the Round of 32 by Egyptian Second Division side FC Masr. The club reached the Play-off round in the 2016 CAF Confederation Cup after beating Defence Force of Ethiopia, CS Don Bosco of DR Congo and CS Constantine of Algeria in the Preliminary round, First round and Second round respectively; but failed to make it to the group stage as they were eliminated by Al Ahli Tripoli of Libya after the Libyan club won on away goals.
Samy played only 24 league matches in the 2016–17 Egyptian Premier League season due to suspension and a foot injury; but he maintained his good performance in both centre-back and defensive midfielder positions and helped his club to finish the league in the 2nd place and to qualify for the 2018 CAF Champions League for the first time in the club history. Al Ahly made a bid for Samy at the end of the season, but the club refused the offer and renewed his contract.
On 3 March 2017, during Misr Lel Makkasa and Zamalek league match, Samy made controversies after he cleared a cross from a free-kick with his hand. All Zamalek players ran to the referee asking for a penalty, but the international referee Gehad Grisha didn't give it because he didn't see it and gave a corner instead. The match ended as a 1–0 win for Misr Lel Makkasa.
Samy was announced as the club's new captain for the 2017–18 Egyptian Premier League season, after spending more that 3 years with the club. Many important players left Misr Lel Makkasa after the club announced the departure of coach Ehab Galal, as left the club by mutual consent; players including top goalscorer Ahmed El Sheikh, playmakers Hussein El Shahat and Emad Fathy and goalkeeper Ahmed Masoud; which led to instability in the team.
On 30 December 2017, Samy alongside other players from the Egyptian Premier League and other Arab leagues played for Al Ahly against Atlético Madrid in a friendly match under the slogan "Peace Against Terrorism" at Borg El Arab Stadium in Alexandria. The match ended 3–2 for Atlético Madrid.
Tala'ea El Gaish (loan).
Samy joined Tala'ea El Gaish on loan for two years.
Pyramids.
In November 2020, Samy signed for Pyramids on a four-year deal.
International career.

Bernhard Heisig

Bernhard Heisig (31 March 1925 – 10 June 2011) was a German painter and graphic artist. Long-time director of the Leipzig Academy (Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst; 1961–64, 1976–87) and a leading figure in East Germany's "Leipzig School," which included Wolfgang Mattheuer and Werner Tübke, he painted in the tradition of Max Beckmann, Otto Dix, and Oskar Kokoschka. His experiences from World War II on both the western and eastern fronts were a recurring subject in his art beginning in the late 1960s, and it is for these works that he is best known in the West. Highly regarded on both sides of the Berlin Wall in the 1980s, he was at the center of controversy after German unification when his painting "Time and Life" was selected to hang in the German parliament. The painting is a panorama of German history and hangs in the cafeteria on the first floor of the Reichstag building. The controversy was part of the larger German-German "Bilderstreit" (image battle) over what role East German art and artists should be allowed to play in the new Germany.

Lexicalist hypothesis

Lexicalist hypothesis is a hypothesis proposed by Noam Chomsky in which he claims that syntactic transformations only can operate on syntactic constituents. The hypothesis states that the system of grammar that assembles words is separate and different from the system of grammar that assembles phrases out of words.
There are two versions of lexicalist hypothesis: the weak version and the strong version. In weak version the transformations could not operate on the derivational words; and in strong version, the transformations could not operate on both derivational and inflectional words.
Lexicalist hypothesis is a response to generative semanticians who use transformations in the derivation of complex words.
There are objections to the hypothesis such as distributed morphology.
The Lexical Integrity Hypothesis is a subset of the Lexicalist Hypothesis.
History.
In the 1950s, Noam Chomsky introduced generative grammar into the world of linguistics and his theory quickly became widely accepted and popular. He mentioned multiple theories of grammar but he favoured the theory to which he gave a name of transformational generative grammar in particular. Transformational generative grammar states that sentences are formed using the standard generative grammar rules to form what is called a deep structure and from there, rules called transformations are used to change this structure by adding, moving, changing or even deleting material from the present structure.
In 1960, Robert B. Lees brought up a theory that derived nominals are all deverbal and not sentential. In other words, the theory states that nominalizations are not derived from verbs or sentences. Lees' theory prevailed until Noam Chomsky released "Remarks on Nomalization" in 1970. It was in "Remarks on Nomalization", that Chomsky proposed the lexicalist hypothesis. Both Lees' and Chomsky's theories are in support of generative grammar.
Theory.
The lexicalist hypothesis can be dissected into the following aspects.
Idiosyncrasy argument.
The relationship between derived nominals and the corresponding verb from which it is derived, is idiosyncratic and highly irregular. This means morphological transformations of the verb into its derived nominals have no regulations.
For example, there is no apparent morphology-to-meaning link between the verb "profess" (meaning 'to claim or declare openly'), and its derived nominals such as "professor" (meaning ‘university teacher’) or "profession" (meaning 'career'). In this example, changing verbs to their derived nominals involves the addition of "'-or' and '-ion"', which do not inherently add a new dimension of meaning to the verb, indicating that these morphological additions are idiosyncratic, and not systematic.
Another example would be the verb "ignore" (refuse to acknowledge), and its derived nominals "ignorance" (lack of knowledge) and "ignoramus" (a stupid person). The morphological transformations made to the verb "ignore" are largely idiosyncratic, and do not inherently contribute to the meaning.
Internal structure argument.
Structures in which derived nominals occur resemble that of usual noun phrases, rather than following the structures of the verb phrase that the original verb sits in.
Using the verb "refuse" and its derived nominal "refusal" for instance:
[An asterisk (*) in linguistics denotes an ungrammatical form.]
The derived nominal does not occur in the structure of the corresponding verb in which it is derived from. Instead, it should occur in the structure of a generic noun phrase, which can contain determiners, adjectives, and prepositional phrases:
Frozen structure argument.
Derived nominals correspond to base structures, that is, to treat derived nominals as deep structure nouns.
According to Chomsky, (a) and (b) are preferable to (c) and (d).
(a) His looking up of the information.
(b) His defining away of the problem.
(c) *His looking of the information up.
(d) *His defining of the problem away.
With this example, Chomsky demonstrates that particle shift, a process in which the phrase is split up and shifted to another part of the sentence, is not applicable for derived nominal phrases.
Other processes that cannot be applied to derived nominals include:
Originally, these processes could not be applied to base nouns, and therefore, according to the frozen structure argument, they cannot be applied to derived nominals as well.
Criticisms.
Many theorists have come up with examples that seem to undermine the strength of lexicalist hypothesis.
Advocates of the lexicalist hypothesis posit certain properties of syntactic words as evidence for a pre-syntactic word-formation module. Michael Barrie (2012) of Sogang University discusses these properties and argues that none of them presents a solid case for positing a word-building module distinct from syntax.
For example, a syntactic analysis of word formation predicts that the components of a syntactically formed word should have the same syntactic properties as when it appears as an independent word, which can be counted as the property of inheritance. In this regard, Ackema &amp; Neeleman (2004) address the derivation of the word "driver". If the verb "driver" is syntactically constructed from the verb "drive" and the nominalizer "-er", the verb should maintain its verbal properties and be able to take an object, resulting in the ungrammatical "*driver a truck". Then Ackema &amp; Neeleman (2004) come up with various structures that defend this property. Barrie (2012) examines these structures and concludes that their argument in terms of inheritance does not present a valid argument in support of an independent, pre-syntactic word-forming module.
Bruening (2018) argues that lexicalist hypothesis, mainly the part that concerns lexical integrity hypothesis, which assumes that words are separate units that are inserted into syntactic structures, is fundamentally incorrect. He points out three ways in which he believes that the lexicalist hypothesis is mistaken in its view of grammar.
Error 1: Phrasal Syntax Can Feed Word Formation.
According to the lexicalist hypothesis, interaction between the word and phrase systems is unidirectional: the output of the word-formation system provides the input to the phrasal syntax, and not vice versa.
a. She had that "don’t-you-dare!" look.
b. She had that "I’m-so-proud-of-myself" look.
(1) shows that the phrases that constitute the first member of these compounds MUST be put together by the syntax, because they have the form that the syntax requires. As in 1a, they can have the form of a declarative. However, if the first member of the compound violates rules and constraints of the phrasal syntax, the result is ill-formed, as in (2).
a. *She had that "you-don’t-dare!" look.     (obligatory inversion with negative imperative)
b. *She had that "myself-is-so-proud-of-me" look.    (reflexive bad as subject)
If these phrases were not put together by the phrasal syntax but by some other mechanism, that mechanism would have to precisely duplicate the constraints of the phrasal syntax.
Error 2: Phrasal Syntax Has Access To Subword Units.
Bruening (2018) also argues that the lexicalist hypothesis is incorrect in its assertion that the phrasal syntax has no access to subword units.
a. You can pre- or re-mix it.
b. *They produce cranber- and dai-ry products.
a. bi- and a-sexual
b. birth- and adopted sons
c. *bi- and ma-son paraphernalia (bison paraphernalia and mason paraphernalia)
Bruening analyzes that in (4), for example, that the strings "bi-" and "a-", as well as the string "son", can stand alone. However, (4c) does not function because the morphemes "bi-", "ma-" (which sounds identical to "a-"), and son are not distinct in these terms. This means that ellipsis can't only work with phonological or prosodic strings; it also requires access to morphological structure.
Error 3: Morphology And Syntax Obey The Same Principles.
According to the lexicalist hypothesis, as distinct components of grammar, the word-formation system and the phrasal system can be assumed to follow different principles. Bruening looks at some of the claimed distinctions between word formation and phrasal syntax, and concludes that none of those distinctions are real, and therefore morphology and syntax follow the same rules.

Philharmonie station

Philharmonie ("Philharmonic Hall") is an underground station of the Essen Stadtbahn in the Südviertel district, Essen near the Saalbau Essen, which is referenced by the name of the station. Today, Stadtbahn line U11 as well as tram lines 107 and 108 and night services NE8 and NE13 call the station. It is the oldest Stadtbahn station in Essen.
Building.
The station is located below the street of Huyssenallee near the Philharmonie of Saalbau Essen. The station has four entrances and two tracks with side platforms. Mixed-gauge tracks with three rails are used to allow Stadtbahn trains as well as trams to use the station.
History.
The station opened on 5 October 1967 along with the first, 522 meters long tunnel under the Friedrichstraße/Hohenzollernstraße, the former B1 road. Tram lines to Rüttenscheid, to Bredeney, Rellinghausen and Gruga used it.
Initially, the station was called "Saalbau", since 2004 "Philharmonie/Saalbau". Later, the addition "Saalbau" was deleted.

Joe Wallace

Joe Wallace (born Joseph Sylvester Wallace, 29 October 1890 – 1 December 1975) was a Canadian poet, journalist, and communist activist. As a poet, he was briefly affiliated with The Song Fishermen, an informal group of poets from Atlantic Canada. Wallace enjoyed a limited reputation in Canadian literature, but he had a direct influence on better known poets with strong political views, such as Dorothy Livesay and Milton Acorn. From the 1950s until after his death, Wallace was almost certainly the best known Canadian poet in Eastern Europe and China.
Biography.
On 29 October 1890, Joe Wallace was born in Toronto to Thomas Wallace and Mary (Polly) Redmond. He was the fourth of seven children. His mother died in 1897, due to complications related to childbirth. After remarrying, his father moved the family to Nova Scotia, where they lived in Truro, North Sydney, and Halifax. At the age of eleven, Wallace ran away from home. His father, in response, sent his son to St. Patrick's Catholic Home for Boys. He then attended high school in North Sydney before going around 1910 to St. Francis Xavier University, from which he was expelled two years later. He remained a practising Catholic for the rest of his life.
His brother got him a job working for the International Correspondence School in Newfoundland. After Wallace transferred to Halifax, he became the district manager. In 1916 he went to work for his brother in the Wallace Advertising Service and continued to work in this field successfully until 1933.
In 1915, he married Therese Dorothy (Dot) Granville. They had four children. In 1925, his five-year-old daughter died; in 1927, his wife died. In 1928, he married Grace Beardsley, but they soon separated.
Wallace was active in Halifax in the Young Men's Liberal Club, but by 1920 he had resigned to join the local Independent Labour Party. In the provincial election that year, he received 3,409 votes and finished in tenth place as one of the four Labour candidates in the four-member Halifax constituency. In the 1933 provincial election, he ran in Halifax Centre on the United Front ticket but received only 146 votes.
In 1922, Wallace joined the Communist Party of Canada (CPC). He wrote articles, essays, and poems for Canadian Communist newspapers, including the "Worker" (1922–1936), the "Daily Clarion" (1936–1939), and the "Canadian Tribune" (1940–1975). He also worked in Ottawa and Montréal as an organizer for the Canadian Labour Defence League.
In 1940, when Mackenzie King invoked the War Measures act, making Communist activities effectively illegal, Wallace and more than 100 other leftists were arrested and placed in internment camps. Wallace was imprisoned between 8 March 1941 and October 1942.
After his time in prison, Wallace released his first volume of poetry, "Night Is Ended" (1942), which included personal and political poems, some of them written during his internment in Hull. The book included an endorsement by Canadian poet E.J. Pratt. Wallace then trained to support the war effort by working as a lathe operator at Ferranti Electric in Toronto, where he helped organize a union. After the war, he found work as a hospital caretaker.
In 1952, he help establish the literary magazine "New Frontiers" and served as one of the first members of the editorial committee. The magazine survived for five years. During this time he also published a small collection, "All My Brothers" (1953), which the critic Northrop Frye said was "sometimes laboured" and "sometimes also clear and precise" and "demonstrated the sheer intensity of the Marxist view of the capitalist world." Another small collection, "Hi Sister, Hi Brother!" (1956) followed.
In early 1957, Wallace traveled to the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China and spent ten months there. He found his poetry known and appreciated. An anthology of his work was published in Moscow in 1958. He returned in 1960, staying until 1963, and another book was published there in 1964. His books circulated in thousands of copies in both English and Russian.
In 1968, Wallace moved to Vancouver. On 1 December 1975, he died of a heart attack.
Legacy.
In 1981, Progress Books prepared a selected edition of his works, titled "Joe Wallace Poems".
In 2010, two of his poems ('The Five Point Star' and 'All My Brothers Are Beautiful') were anthologized in Brian Trehearne's 'Canadian Poetry: 1920–1960.
Some of his poems have been set to music, including "O Lovely Land" and "Making Hay." One early poem, "The Voice of the Worker", is set to music and performed by folklorist Richard MacKinnon on the CD "Songs of Steel, Coal and Protest."

Jeanne Gaillard (1909 – 19 September 1983) was a French historian and a member of the French Resistance during the Second World War.
Biography.
She was born at La Rochelle. Her father, a career officer, having been killed during the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915, she grew up at Béziers and received a scholarship to enable her to study history at Montpellier. After graduating in 1930, she became a teacher, holding positions at Guéret and Toulouse and, in 1936, at the Lycée Jules-Ferry in Paris, where she continued until 1950. In 1937, she met her husband Pol, and they were married in 1941. They had five children: Anne, Manuelle, Pierre, Luc and Roland.
Gaillard became a militant Communist. In 1940, she offered refuge to the Jewish physicist Jacques Solomon, a fellow teacher and editor of an underground magazine, "L'Université libre", at her Paris home. Solomon was later arrested and executed by the occupying forces. Jeanne and her husband continued to participate in the production and distribution of the magazine.
After the war, she was a regular contributor to the multidisciplinary publication "". In 1950, she took up a teaching post at the , but she was forced to leave in 1955, her health weakened by an earlier bout of tuberculosis. From 1964 to 1976, she worked as a "Maître-assistante" at the Paris Nanterre University, where she published many articles and obtained her doctorate in history; her thesis, "Paris, la ville", accepted in 1975, is extensively quoted in historical research. Adrian Rifkin calls it "a long and complex chef d'oeuvre of urban demography", but criticises Gaillard's use of history to support the Marxist economic theories of Guy Debord. Parallels have been drawn between Gaillard's work and Walter Benjamin's Arcades Project.
Jeanne died in 1983 from an allergic reaction to a wasp bite.

2018 Atlanta Dream season

The 2018 WNBA season was the 11th season for the Atlanta Dream of the Women's National Basketball Association. The team began its season on May 20, 2018 against the Dallas Wings.
The Dream started the season slowly, going 2–2 in May with both losses coming to Dallas. The team continued to not be able to build momentum in June, posting a 5–6 record. The team started well in the month, going on a three game win streak, but couldn't continue that run, winning just 2 of the final 7 games in the month. However, the Dream found another gear in July. The Dream went on an 8 game winning streak and head coach Nicki Collen was awarded the Coach of the Month. The team finished the month 9–2 and in prime playoff position. The team continued its run in August, going 6–1 with their only loss on the road against Phoenix. Collen was again voted coach of the month. However, on August 9th, the team lost their star Angel McCoughtry for the season with torn ligaments in her left knee. The team finished a franchise–best 23–11 which entered them into the 2018 WNBA Playoffs as the second seed.
As the second seed, Atlanta earned a double bye into the semifinal round. There, Atlanta faced off against the Washington Mystics. The Mystics were the third seed, finishing one game behind Atlanta in the regular season. The series was a close one, with the Mystics star Elena Delle Donne getting injured in game 3. However, the Dream were not able to capitalize and eventually lost the series 2 games to 3.

Calgary Trail &amp; Gateway Boulevard

Calgary Trail and Gateway Boulevard are a pair of major arterial roadways in Edmonton, Alberta. Gateway Boulevard carries northbound traffic while Calgary Trail carries southbound traffic. From south of 31 Avenue, they form a two-way freeway separated by a median; for this portion, the roadway maintains the separate names for northbound and southbound traffic. Near 31 Avenue, Calgary Trail and Gateway Boulevard separate and become parallel one-way arterial roadways to Saskatchewan Drive, at the edge of the North Saskatchewan River valley. Designated as part of Highway 2 south of Whitemud Drive, it is Edmonton's main southern entrance and is both a major commuter route, connecting to the Edmonton International Airport and Leduc, as well as a regional connection to Central Alberta, and Calgary.
Route description.
Calgary Trail and Gateway Boulevard enter Edmonton from the south along Highway 2, the city's busiest entrance, is "core route" of Canada's National Highway System, and part of the North-South Trade Corridor. Despite the freeway being a two-way roadway, the northbound lanes go by the name "Gateway Boulevard" and the southbound lanes go by the name "Calgary Trail". At the city limits, the northern terminus of the Queen Elizabeth II Highway, is the interchange with 41 Avenue SW, which opened in 2015, and is the only numbered exit on Highway 2 within Edmonton. The freeway continues north past Gateway Park, a rest area which is marked by the historic Leduc No. 1 oil derrick; originally opened in 1987, it featured tourist information centre that closed in 2014. Calgary Trail and Gateway Boulevard reach Anthony Henday Drive (Highway 216), Edmonton's ring road, which is the northern extent of both National Highway System and trade corridor designations. It continues past South Edmonton Common and the interchange with 23 Avenue. North of 23 Avenue (around 31 Avenue), the freeway portion of the Calgary Trail and Gateway Boulevard ends and the roadways split into parallel one-way streets.
North of the one-way transition, the Calgary Trail and Gateway Boulevard become arterial roadways with numerous retail and commercial services located between the two roadways. The first set of traffic signals is at 34 Avenue, and it continues north to Whitemud Drive, where Highway 2 continues along Whitemud Drive west. North of Whitemud Drive and 51 Avenue at 54 Avenue is the transition where southbound 104 Street becomes Calgary Trail. Gateway Boulevard and 104 Street pass through mixed light industrial and commercial areas before entering Old Strathcona and intersects Whyte (82) Avenue. Gateway Boulevard and 104 Street end at Saskatchewan Drive at the edge North Saskatchewan River valley. North of University Avenue, 104 Street is a two-way street with a northbound bus-only lane between University Avenue and 83 Avenue, and being a conventional two-way street between 83 Avenue and Saskatchewan Drive.
Calgary Trail (104 Street) and Gateway Boulevard function as the major connection between downtown Edmonton and the Edmonton International Airport; however, they do not directly connect with downtown or cross the North Saskatchewan River. Inbound traffic via Gateway Boulevard and Saskatchewan Drive can be accessed via Queen Elizabeth Park Road which connects with the Walterdale Bridge, or alternatively continuing along Saskatchewan Drive which connects with the James MacDonald Bridge and Low Level Bridge. The main outbound route via 104 Street (Calgary Trail) can be accessed via 109 Street and the High Level Bridge and then following Saskatchewan Drive to connect with southbound 104 Street.
History.
The roadways are the remnant of the northern terminus of the Calgary and Edmonton Trail, a land transport route between the fur trading posts of Fort Edmonton and Fort Calgary, used as far back as the early 1800s. The roadways were originally part of central Strathcona and conformed to the former city's quadrant numbering system, as such 104 Street (Calgary Trail) was known as "Main Street" and was the division between the west and east quadrants (Whyte Avenue was the division between the north and south quadrants), while Gateway Boulevard was known as "1st Street E". In 1912, Edmonton and Strathcona amalgamated Edmonton adopted its present numbering system; Main Street was renamed as "104 Street" while 1st Street E was renamed as "103 Street". As Alberta's highway system developed, 104 Street became part of Highway 1 (renumbered to Highway 2 in 1941) to the 54 Avenue area before shifting to the southeast and continuing south along the CP rail line Edmonton-Calgary line and aligned with 103 Street, going by the name of "Calgary Trail".
The City of Edmonton commissioned the 1963 Metro Edmonton Transportation Study (METS) to address the need for free-flow traffic corridors and more river crossings in the downtown area. The plan proposed a downtown freeway loop with feeder routes, including three southern approaches via Calgary Trail and 111 Street and 91 Street / Mill Creek Ravine. The transition from 104 Street to Calgary Trail was converted to a split intersection at 51 Avenue, and included partial access 103 Street, which had become a collector road adjacent to the CP rail line. The freeway proposal through the North Saskatchewan River valley and its feeder ravines proved to be very controversial, with public protests suspending construction. In tandem with cost overruns, the majority of project was cancelled in 1974.
In the early 1980s, 103 Street, 104 Street, and Calgary Trail were converted to one-way streets, with 104 Street carrying southbound traffic while 103 Street and Calgary Trail (renamed as "Calgary Trail Northbound") carrying northbound traffic. As part of the project, a parallel, one-way roadway was constructed from the 104 Street / Calgary Trail transition to the 31 Avenue area and designated as "Calgary Trail Southbound". The split intersection at 51 Avenue was partially removed (now the site of a Real Canadian Superstore) while the original transition alignment was designated as "54 Avenue". In 2001, Calgary Trail Northbound/103 Street and Calgary Trail Southbound were renamed as Gateway Boulevard and Calgary Trail respectively, initially the name change met with some controversy.
Highway 2 used to enter Edmonton and abruptly transition from a freeway to an arterial roadway with traffic signals at Ellerslie Road and 23 Avenue; however the intersections were upgraded when interchanges were completed in 2001 and 2011 respectively.
Calgary Trail and Gateway Boulevard have been synonymous Highway 2 in Edmonton. Originally, Highway 2 followed Calgary Trail and 104 Street to Whyte (82) Avenue before turning west to 109 Street, then crossing the High Level Bridge and eventually connecting with St. Albert Trail. In the mid-1980s, in an effort to bypass downtown, the Highway 2 designation was moved to Whitemud Drive; however, "To Highway 2 south" guide signs still frequent Calgary Trail.
Future.
There have been proposals to improve the Gateway Boulevard connection with the Walterdale Bridge and downtown Edmonton by removing a hairpin turn required to access Queen Elizabeth Park Road. Due to the topography of the river valley, proposals have shown that Gateway Boulevard would have to be realigned in pass under Saskatchewan Drive. There is no finalized alignment or timeline for construction.

Paul Weeden

Paul Winston Weeden (born 7 January 1923 in Indianapolis – 2 July 2011 in Oslo) was an American-Norwegian jazz guitarist and bandleader.
Biography.
In his hometown he played Wes Montgomery and J. J. Johnson with his neighbor before moving to New York City and then Philadelphia. He led the Paul Weeden Trio with organist Don Patterson and drummer Billy James, and they released an album with Dexter Gordon and Sonny Stitt (Blue Note Records, 1962). He also played in bands of Coleman Hawkins and Jimi Hendrix in the 1960s.
After touring in Sweden in 1966, he moved to Norway in 1971. With Magni Wentzel, Håkon Nilsen and Svein Christiansen he made the "I Remember Clifford" for EBU's "Eurojazz" (NRK, 1971).
Weeden was sentral to the people surrounding the Club 7 venue, where he led the band Youngbloods as well as his own quartet (including drummer Ole Jacob Hansen, guitarist Bill Mulholland, and bassist Ray Taylor).
After the death of Freddie Green (1911–1987), Weeden replaced him on guitar in the Count Basie Orchestra, recommended by Harry Edison (1911–1999). He was contacted by the leader, Frank Foster (1928–2011) and joined on tour from January 1988.
In the 1990s he performed his own October for recording, including Vidar Johansen, Odd Riisnæs, Roy Nikolaisen, Eivin Sannes, Rune Nicolaysen, Kristen Svendsen, and Ole Jacob Hansen. The documentary "Too Young To Be Old" by Lene Midling-Jenssen (NRK, 2003) shows Weedens collaboration with "Grønnes Bad&amp;Jazzforsyning" from Flekkefjord. This also led to record release (2003). He led up to 2006 his own quintet with Brinck Johnsen, Eivin Sannes, Kristen Svendsen and Tom Olstad.
He lived in Oslo to his death, and was the father of the musician Paul Weeden, Jr., Ronald Weeden, Cynthia Weeden, Genice DeLemos, Dwayne DeLemos, April Weeden, Rickey Weeden, Lasse Weeden, Dennis Michael Weeden, and Thomas Weeden.

Looking back at five years ago, with his best-selling books, fully booked schedule for talks and media interviews, Zhuo JinShu was a rising celebrity psychiatrist and one of the sought-after psychiatrists in the social elites circle. While he was immersing himself in the sweet smell of success, he was unaware that his girlfriend – JieFang had been suffering from a mental illness – “Delusion of Jealousy.” Feeling neglected and insecure, JieFang had been haunted by her uncontrollable suspicion about JinShu cheating on her. This excessive delusion of jealousy eventually pushed her to the verge of insanity and made her attempt to end her life together with JinShu. In the midst of chaotic pushing and pulling, both of them accidentally fell from the high floor. This fatal incident took JieFang's life and caused JinShu to be in a critical condition. Despite the physical recovery later on, JinShu has suffered from “Post Traumatic Stress Disorder – PTSD.” JinShu was deeply traumatized by witnessing his own girlfriend's death. The deep feeling of guilt and remorse made him withdraw into himself completely; he shunned himself from the outside world, and no one had ever heard from him since then.

1896 United States presidential election in Tennessee

The 1896 United States presidential election in Tennessee took place on November 3, 1896. All contemporary 45 states were part of the 1896 United States presidential election. Tennessee voters chose 12 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
Background.
For over a century after the Civil War, Tennessee’s white citizenry was divided according to partisan loyalties established in that war. Unionist regions covering almost all of East Tennessee, Kentucky Pennyroyal-allied Macon County, and the five West Tennessee Highland Rim counties of Carroll, Henderson, McNairy, Hardin and Wayne voted Republican – generally by landslide margins – as they saw the Democratic Party as the “war party” who had forced them into a war they did not wish to fight. Contrariwise, the rest of Middle and West Tennessee who had supported and driven the state’s secession was equally fiercely Democratic as it associated the Republicans with Reconstruction. After the state’s white landowning class re-established its rule in the early 1870s, black and Unionist white combined to forge adequate support for the GOP to produce a competitive political system for two decades, although during this era the Republicans could only capture statewide offices when the Democratic Party was divided on this issue of payment of state debt. 
White Democrats in West Tennessee were always aiming to eliminate black political influence, which they first attempted to do by election fraud in the middle 1880s and did so much more successfully at the end of that decade by instituting in counties with significant black populations a secret ballot that prevented illiterates voting, and a poll tax throughout the state, which cut turnout by at least a third in the 1890s. This poll tax was supposedly relaxed or paid by party officials in Unionist Republican areas, where whites were much poorer than in secessionist areas.
The mid-1890s Populist movement did not affect Tennessee so much as other southern states, with the party never cracking 12 percent in any biennial gubernatorial election.
Vote.
Although the state’s poll tax had already reduced the Republican black and poor white electorate, Democratic managers were unsure about carrying Tennessee in late October, because it was felt that urban businessmen would desert the party in sufficient numbers for McKinley to come close to carrying the state. Polls the day before the election suggested Tennessee would be exceedingly close, but as it turned out Bryan would carry the state relatively easily by around six points, which was still a decline upon recent Democratic performances despite a quantitatively reduced Republican electorate.

C19orf70

Chromosome 19 open reading frame 70, also known as QIL1, MICOS complex subunit MIC13 (MIC13) or Protein P117 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "C19orf70" gene.
Structure.
The "C19orf70" gene is located on the p arm of chromosome 19 at position 13.3 and it spans 2,482 base pairs. The "C19orf70" gene produces a 9.7 kDa protein composed of 88 amino acids.
Function.
The "C19orf70" gene encodes for a subunit of the MICOS (mitochondrial contact site and cristae junction organizing system) complex of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The 700-kD complex plays diverse roles such as the maintenance of crista junctions, formation of contact junctions to the outer membrane, and the dynamic regulation of mitochondrial membrane architecture. C19orf70, a component of the mature MICOS complex, localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane at the cristae junctions and incorporates MINOS1 and MIC10 into the MICOS complex. The protein is necessary for the creation of the cristae junction, integrity of the cristae junction, and maintenance of cristae morphology. It is also essential for normal mitochondrial function.
Clinical Significance.
Mutations in "C19orf70" has been shown to result in mitochondrial deficiencies and related disorders caused by the disassembly of MICOS complex with abnormal cristae morphology and failure of mitochondrial respiration. Major clinical manifestations have included mitochondrial hepato-encephalopathy and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria accompanied by severe psychomotor retardation, intractable seizures, cerebellar atrophy, early death, Lactic acidemia, neutropenia, and elevated liver transaminases.
Interactions.
C19orf70 has been known to interact with MRPL24, APOOL, STOML2, IMMT, MTX1, CHCHD3, and other proteins.

Lycée Français de Sofia

Lycée Français Alphonse de Lamartine de Sofia (LFAL, in Bulgarian: 9-та френска езикова гимназия „Алфонс дьо Ламартин", ФЕГ) is a selective French language school in Sofia, established in 1961 under the name 9th French Language School Georgi Kirkov. Since the early 1990s, it has been named after the French nobleman, poet, diplomat and politician Alphonse de Lamartine, who visited and resided in the Bulgarian lands in 1832.
The Lycée is the only Bulgarian school to offer bilingual French-speaking course to all its students and has been the described as "the most important French-speaking secondary school in Bulgaria" as well as "the heart of the academic Francophonie in Bulgaria" by the Agency for French Education Abroad. It is regarded as one of the most prestigious schools in Sofia and its students have consistently ranked among the top performers in the national matriculation exams.
As of the 2020–2021 academic year, the school had 987 students and 83 staff members, with a student-teacher ratio of 1:14.
History.
Early years.
In 1881, missionaries founded an American girls' school in Lovech, which gained popularity and prestige in the coming decades. In 1927, it became an American College and began to issue high school diplomas. The college was forcibly closed in 1948 as a conductor of "capitalist ideology", but in 1950, the Foreign Language High School, which gained popularity through the film "Vchera", was created in its place. Four of the school's classes studied French, one studied English and one studied German. In 1956, the English class moved to Sofia and started the First English Language School. In 1958, the French section moved to Varna and founded the Lycée Joliot-Curie. In 1960, the German High School in Sofia emerged from the German section, and in the following year the French section was separated from it.
Establishment.
When it was founded in 1961, the Lycée was housed in the Nadezhda district along with the German High School. For the academic year of 1963, it was relocated to its present building at 35 Patriarch Evtimiy Boulevard in downtown Sofia, which at that time housed the 9th Polytechnic High School. The last year group of the Polytechnic School graduated in 1965, and the school became purely linguistic. Classes with Spanish language were also opened in 1977, but in 1991, they were moved to the newly established Spanish Language School Miguel de Cervantes.
In 1976, the Lycée was awarded the Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius, and in 1977, it was accepted as a member of the UNESCO Associated Schools Network. During his historic visit to Bulgaria in 1989, French President François Mitterrand visited the school, where he was greeted by students. Mitterand got carried away conversing with the students and stayed longer than planned, violating the protocol.
Teachers’ strike.
In 2007, many teachers from across the country went on a strike. The Lycée’s teachers gained notoriety across the country for marking all of their 900 students with excellent grades in protest of the low teachers' pay and the government's refusal to grant more money for scholarships.
A number of unannounced inspections followed as a result of the teachers’ actions. The school’s then principle, Penka Malinska, was accused of undermining its prestige and "financial misuse" of the scholarships which the students had received as a result of the higher marks. Malinska was forcibly retired despite not having reached retirement age at the time. Her retirement was accompanied by an acute reaction from both students and teachers. Over a hundred students marched in her support, starting at the Lycée's entrance and ending in front of the building of the Ministry of Education and Science.
Education.
The Lycée has established traditions and high authority in French language training. Intensive language learning is done through a program which includes 20 hours of French weekly in 8th, also called preparatory, grade and from 6 to 8 hours in later years. Some subjects, such as history, geography, biology, physics, chemistry and philosophy, are taught in French. The school's graduates can enroll in French universities without a language exam. In 2015, the school was awarded the , a seal of quality for bilingual education in French and another language.
During the five years of study, French literature and culture are extensively and chronologically studied in all their genres. Eleventh and twelfth grade students can submit and defend a dossier in a school subject of their choice, for which they can receive a bilingual education diploma, known as Attestation bilingue.
The Lycée's students can enroll in Microsoft’s MCP Program for which they can receive a certificate which validates their technical expertise.
Language certificates.
The school is the largest DELF examination center in Bulgaria, given the large number of students and candidates. The certification was introduced in 2007 by a Convention signed between the Ministry of Education and Science of Bulgaria and the French Institut of Sofia and is renewed every three years. All of the school's French language teachers are CIEP accredited examiners.
Approximately 5500 students have been enrolled in the DELF A2, B1 and B2 examinations at the Lycée Lamartine Examination Center from 2007 to 2020.
Teachers.
The Lycée employs more than 70 teachers. Many of them are authors of text- and handbooks, give lectures and teach at Sofia University, New Bulgarian University and other universities. More than half of the high school teachers are former graduates and a part of the French language teachers are French.
Traditions.
The shool's motto is "Ça ira puisque nous sommes ensemble!" ().
Arts.
The Lycée has established traditions in theater. Each year, its theatrical troupe produces and presents a play based on a different piece by a classical French author, for which it has won several awards. The school has a choir.
Photography lessons are offered as a complementary subject, and there are plenty of exhibitions on the walls of the school's hallways.
Sports.
The school's volleyball and basketball teams participate in the prestigious Claris Cup, in which the elite high schools of Sofia compete against each other, and the football team participates in the Bulgarian School Football League. The school also offers other sporting activities such as badminton, tennis, table tennis, skiing, swimming and chess.
International relations.
The school offers educational and cultural exchanges with French-language schools from Europe, including Lycée Jacques Decour and Lycée Gerson in Paris, Collège Claparède in Geneva, Lycée Jean Pierre Vernant in Sèvres and more. The school's projects are supported by the French Institute of Sofia.

François Cosserat

François Cosserat (1852–1914) was a French engineer and mathematician known by his theories about deformable bodies written with his brother Eugène.
Life and work.
François Cosserat was the eldest of the three sons of François-Constant Cosserat, a textile manufacturer in Amiens. The three sons achieved to study in one of the "grandes écoles" of Paris. François studied at the École Polytechnique from 1870 to 1872 and then in the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées until 1875. François Cosserat followed a typical career as civil engineer in the French East Railroad Company constructing and designing bridges, tunnels, etc. In 1895 he became chief engineer. Besides his engineer career he worked with his junior brother, Eugène, in mechanics and elasticity, publishing papers and a book about it.
In 1913 he was elected president of the Société mathématique de France.
His most important work is his book, a joint work with his brother, "Théorie des corps déformables (Theory of deformable bodies)" (1909) in which laid the foundations of the mechanics of the generalized continua. His approach can be particularly useful in modeling nonlinear elastic inhomogeneous deformations and inelastic deformations. Other remarkable joint works are: "Théorie de l'élasticité" (1896), "Note sur la cinématique d'un milieu continu" (1897), "Note sur la dynamique du point et du corps invariable" (1906) and "Note sur la théorie de l'action euclidienne" (1909).

AlternateHistory.com is a web forum dedicated to the discussion of alternate history. The forum was founded in September 2000 by Ian Montgomerie, a Canadian immigrant residing in New York, as a split-off from a Usenet newsgroup. It is currently the largest English-language forum dedicated to the study and discussion of alternate history, with around 10,000 active members and over 400,000 discussion threads.
Description and impact.
AlternateHistory.com is centered around discussion of how history may have unfolded differently with only small changes made to the past, a phenomenon described as the butterfly effect. The forum is divided into Administration, Discussion, and Off-topic sections, and also contains a wiki. Its users, along with those at other alternate history discussion boards, have developed a lexicon unique to the discussion of alternate history. It is also known for hosting a community of map-makers who contribute maps for timelines and for works of fiction, such as the alternate history world of "The Handmaid's Tale". The site has also been used as a resource by newspapers like the "New York Times" to describe the concept of alternate history to their audiences. Posts on AlternateHistory.com made by a Wikipedia editor who had controversially deleted information critical of Canadian politician Adrian Dix also became a minor political issue.
In 2020 Alternatehistory.com received some attention when a doctored image of a "Washington Times" headline declaring Al Gore winner of the 2000 presidential election was taken from the site and retweeted by Trump campaign official Tim Murtaugh to give an example of the media making an incorrect call of a presidential election. Murtaugh received pushback from the "Washington Times", which informed Murtaugh that it had never published a headline like that.

2018 African Union base attack in Bulo Marer

On 1 April 2018, Al-Shabaab fighters attacked an AMISOM base in Bulo Marer in the Lower Shebelle region of Somalia.
Attack.
Two trucks filled with explosives blew up at the AMISOM military camp in Bula Marer, 110 km south of Mogadishu. Then about 100 Al-Shabaab militants attacked the base with gunfire. Another suicide bomber rammed his vehicle packed with explosives into a military convoy carrying Ugandan soldiers from Golweyn. According to the Deputy Governor of Lower Shabelle region Ali Nur Mohamed, AMISOM troops destroyed the vehicle with a rocket propelled grenade. The militants also attacked a third AMISOM base in Barawe with mortars and launched infantry attacks on two Somali government positions in Qoryoley and Mashallay. These attacks were reportedly intended to distract the troops in those camps from supporting the forces in Bulo Marer. Witnesses said Al-Shabaab terrorists attacked civilians and set houses and shops on fire after they raided the military base.
Ali Nur Mohamed told VOA Somali that AMISOM and Somali troops repulsed all attacks.
Casualties.
The death toll was not clear. Uganda People's Defense Force spokesman Richard Karemire said four Ugandan peacekeepers were killed and six AMISOM troops injured. Thirty Al-Shabaab terrorists were killed according to his reports. Al-Shabaab's military operations spokesperson Abdiaziz Abu Mus'ab said that the group lost only 14 fighters and killed at least 59 African Union soldiers. Abdi Nur Hashi, a Somali military colonel stationed near the base, told the Guardian that as many as 46 Ugandan troops died in the attack. One Somali soldier died and several others were injured.

Kent and Medway Medical School

Kent and Medway Medical School (KMMS) is a medical school based in Canterbury, Kent. It was created as a collaboration between the University of Kent and Canterbury Christ Church University, and offers around 100 places per year. Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS) acts as the contingency school. KMMS offers five-year undergraduate programmes, with a focus on specialties currently under-represented in Kent and Medway.
History.
Funding for KMMS was announced in March 2018 following a competition to allocate 1500 new medical training posts across England. Stages 1 and 2 of the General Medical Council (GMC) accreditation process for new schools had been completed in advance of this announcement. The Founding Dean was appointed in September 2018 and stages 3 to 6 of the GMC accreditation were completed before the first 100 students enrolled in September 2020.
Teaching.
As of the 2020/2021 academic year the school has a single, 5-year undergraduate (UG) Bachelor of Medicine Bachelor of Surgery (BM BS) programme which will lead to a Primary Medical Qualification (PMQ) when the programme is accredited by the GMC in summer 2025.
Undergraduate Programme.
Structure.
The UG programme is closely linked to the 5-year programme offered by KMMS' contingency school BSMS. It starts with two years of systems-based modules which cover the major body systems and include the foundational biopsychosocial knowledge required before years 3-5. Each year of years 1 and 2 also includes a Skills for Clinical Practice module and a Professional Development and Person Centred Care (PDPCP) module which each lasts for the full academic year. The PDPCP modules include immersion weeks of placement in General Practice and Community Health. There are 6 weeks of clinical placement in year 1 and 7 weeks in year 2. This amounts to one of the largest amounts of clinical placement time in the early stages of the programme of any UK medical school.
Years 3, 4 and 5 have yet to be delivered but the school plans that they will be based on the principle of Longitudinal Integrated Placements (LIPs). This will involve students spending nearly the entire academic year on placement.
Final exams will happen around Easter time in year 5 and are followed by an Elective module and a Transition to Practice module.
Student selected components (SSCs).
KMMS students have the opportunity to engage in some compulsory, but student selected activities. As in the BSMS programme students complete SSCs in Years 1 and 2. In year 4 there is a year long module called the Individual Research Project and in year 5 there is an Elective module.
Intercalation.
KMMS students will have the opportunity to intercalate. After the 3rd year they have the option to do and intercalated Bachelors degree, after 4th year they can choose to do an intercalated Masters degree. The school is also developing options to do an intercalated MD/PhD. The menu of options is currently in development.
Admissions.
As one of 5 new school which were granted places in 2018, KMMS has a strong mission to widen participation in medicine. This means broadening the demographic of students who get the opportunity to become doctors and ensuring that any unfair biases within their selection system are removed. In 2019 and 2020 they had approximately 1500 applications for 100 places.
KMMS welcomes applications from school leavers, graduate entrants and from people who have completed Access to Medicine programmes. All applicants must apply via the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) and complete the University Clinical Aptitude Test (UCAT) in the year that they apply to the school.
After application and shortlisting all selected applicants are invited to a Multiple Mini Interview (MMI).
The school issues offer letters to selected applicants in time with the usual UCAS timeline for medical and dental programmes.

1896 United States presidential election in Mississippi

The 1896 United States presidential election in Mississippi took place on November 3, 1896. All contemporary 45 states were part of the 1896 United States presidential election. Mississippi voters chose nine electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
Mississippi was won by the Democratic nominees, former U.S. Representative William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska and his running mate Arthur Sewall of Maine. With black disfranchisement virtually complete due to onerous poll taxes and literacy tests, Mississippi would begin seven decades as a one-party Democratic state, as the state completely lacked areas of upland or German refugee whites opposed to secession. No Republican would serve in the state legislature between 1902 and the 1960s, and only once until 1950 – when Herbert Hoover won riding on anti-Catholic and Prohibitionist sentiment the Pine Belt counties of Pearl River, Stone and George in 1928 – would the state Democratic nominee lose a Mississippi county in any Presidential election.

Weh Antiok Khosrow

Wēh Antīōk Khosrow (Middle Persian: wyḥ ʾntywk ḥwslwd; literally, "better than Antioch, Khosrow built this"), also called Beh-az-Andīw-e Khosrow (New Persian: , "Better-than-Antioch of Khosrow"), Antiocheia Chosroou (Greek), Rūmagān (), or al-Rūmīya (), was a city founded by Khosrow I on the east bank of the Tigris in the vicinity of Ctesiphon, Sasanian Empire, that was populated by deported Roman prisoners-of-war. It was reportedly about one day's walk from Ctesiphon.
The Persians used deportation as a tool of policy. Khosrow I captured Antioch in 540 during the Byzantine–Sasanian wars; the city was destroyed and its population was deported to this new city. According to Jacob of Edessa, prisoners-of-war from the cities of Sura, Beroea, Antioch, Apamea, Callinicum, and Batnai in Osrhoene were deported to this new city. It may be identical with "Māhōzē Ḥəḏattā" (literally "the New City") in the Syriac conciliar acts.
Procopius has provided detailed information on the building of the city, though his primary source is pro-Sasanian. According to al-Tabari and al-Tha'alibi, the city was built on the plan of the Syrian metropolis and Khosrow I did everything in his power to make the residents want to stay. He provided Weh Antiok Khosrow with Roman baths and a circus. He also settled charioteers in the city.
The city was governed by Barāz, a Christian from Gundeshapur.
The city was captured by the Arab Muslims under Khalid ibn Urfuta.
Later in the Abbasid period, Caliph Al-Mansur used the city as his seat for a few months.

KUAN-LD

KUAN-LD, virtual channel 48 (UHF digital channel 17), is a Telemundo owned-and-operated television station serving San Diego, California, United States that is licensed to Poway. Owned by the Telemundo Station Group subsidiary of NBCUniversal (itself a subsidiary of Comcast), it is sister to San Diego-licensed NBC owned-and-operated station KNSD (channel 39). The two stations share studios on Granite Ridge Drive in the Serra Mesa section of San Diego and transmitter facilities southeast of Spring Valley. Despite KUAN-LD legally holding a low-power license, it transmits using KNSD's full-power spectrum. This ensures complete reception across the San Diego television market.
KUAN is known on-air as Telemundo 20; as with KNSD's main branding, it is derived from its channel 20 cable position on Spectrum, Cox Communications and AT&amp;T U-verse.
History.
The station signed on in 1980 as K48AL, originally operating as a translator of Los Angeles-based multicultural independent KSCI for the San Diego market, airing on low-power analog channel 48. It flash-cut to digital channel 36 on June 20, 2016.
In January 2017, NBC announced that it was hiring people for KNSD with the intention of launching a new Telemundo O&amp;O station in San Diego, replacing Tijuana, Mexico-based station XHAS-TDT (whose affiliation expired at the end of June 2017). The new Telemundo affiliate, branded as "Telemundo 20", launched on July 1 on KNSD's digital 39.20 subchannel. As with KGTV's former Azteca América affiliation using their 10.15 subchannel (which XHAS would take over), the unusual numbering was to connect to Telemundo's channel 20 cable position on Cox Communications and other pay TV providers in the area, which was transferred from XHAS. Additionally, KNSD launched TeleXitos, a Spanish equivalent to Cozi TV, on channel 39.21 the same day.
On September 12, 2017, NBCUniversal acquired KUAN from NRJ TV, LLC, the owner of KSCI, for $650,000; the sale was completed on December 21, 2017. Concurrently, KUAN entered into a channel-sharing agreement with KNSD. This was done with the separate KUAN-LD transmitter ending service, and 39.20 and 39.21 becoming identified with KUAN-LD instead and re-numbered to KUAN's channel 48.

Erich Erichsen

Erich Erichsen (31 March 1752 - 7 January 1837) was a Danish merchant and ship-owner. He owned the trading house C. S. Blacks Enke &amp; Co. from 1783. The Erichsen Mansion in Copenhagen is named after him.
Early life and education.
Erichsen was born in Odense, the son of war and district commissioner and chamberlain Laurids Erichsen (1716–56) and Charlotte Christiane von Westen (1724–1801). He completed a merchant's apprenticeship in Copenhagen.
Career.
After completing his apprenticeship, Erichsen was employed in the Blach trading house. He became part of the management of the company after C. S. Blach's death in 1781. He married Blach's widow in 1783 and thus became the owner of the company that changed its name to C. S. Blachs Enke &amp; Co. He was also involved in money lending. His ships brought spices and precious textiles home from the Rast Indies and transported grain from the Baltic countries to England. His fleet consisted of 13 ships in 1797.
Erichsen's shipping enterprise encountered adversities from circa 1800. Several of his ships were captured by privaters. Erichsen responded by increasingly engaging in banking. He provided the Danish government with huge loans in 1808–12 and again in 1819 and the 1820s.
Erichsen's brother Peter Erichsen was for many years a partner in the company. His sons joined it in 1816. Their lack of business talent and devastating life style led the company to ruin. It went bankrupt in 1833.
Erichsen was a member of Danish Asiatic Company's board of directors in 1783–92. He was managing director of Speciesbanken in 1791–1813 and a member of the board of representatives of the National Bank in 1818-25.
He was a member of the Council of 32 Men in 1788–1806 and was president of Grosserer-Societet from its foundation in 1817.
He was appointed to royal agent in 1782, "Etatsråd" in 1812 and "Konferensråd" in 1831.
Property.
Erichsen constructed the Erichsen Mansion at Holmens Kanal in 1799-1801. He also constructed the country house Hellerupgaard to design by Joseph-Jacques Ramée.
In 1807, Blach &amp; Co. owned a warehouse at present-day Bådsmandsstræde 6/Overgaden neden Vandet 51s in Christianshavn and another warehouse at Christianshavns Voldgade 1-3/Overgaden oven Vandet 2 og 2 A.

List of foreign-born players in Spanish men's national basketball team

Complete list of all foreign-born players who, despite having been born abroad, have represented Spain men's national basketball team in international competition since 1935. Some of them were born to Spanish parents abroad, some moved to Spain at a young age, and some others were "naturalized" or acquired citizenship after playing professionally in a Spanish club.
Up to 4 players born in Latin America were in the Spanish squad for the first EuroBasket in 1935, where Spain won the silver medal: brothers Emilio and Pedro Alonso, Rafael Martín and Rafael Ruano. Two Americans were a key factor in the modernization of the sport in Spain in the late 60s and the 70s, Wayne Brabender and Clifford Luyk, with the silver medal at the 1973 EuroBasket as their highest success. Two more Latin Americans were included in the 1980s, Argentinian Juan Domingo de la Cruz and Dominican Chicho Sibilio.
Modern FIBA regulations about the Eligibility and National Status of Players limit the number of naturalized players to one per squad:"A national team participating in a Competition of FIBA may have only one player on its team who has acquired the legal nationality of that country by naturalisation or by any other means after having reached the age of sixteen" (Book 3, Chapter 1, Article 21.a)In recent years, this regulation on a team's roster has avoided the inclusion of Serge Ibaka and Nikola Mirotić at the same time

Michael IV of Georgia

Michael IV or Michael Mirianisdze was Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia, from 1178 to 1184, "Mtsignobartukhutses-Chkondideli" (chancellor) since 1184. Michael held his high offices to the end of his life.
Archbishop of Samtvisi Michael was loyal to King George III. After the resignation of Nikoloz I Gulaberisdze he was appointed as Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia. Following the death of George III the question of the legality of Queen Tamar's status was raised by the great feudal lords, but with the vigorous support of the patriarch Michael IV the question was settled in Tamar's favour. Tamar had to reward the Catholicos-Patriarch Michael's support by making him a chancellor, thus placing him at the top of both the clerical and secular hierarchies. The queen fully appreciated the negative effects of this act and endeavoured to remody the situation. But it was extremely difficult to fight Mikel Mirianisdze. His high offices, particularly the office of head of the Georgian Church, made him a dangerous adversary, and the queen prepared for the struggle painstakingly, with caution. Tamar failed in her attempt to use a church synod to dismiss the Catholicos-Patriarch Michael. Michael held his high offices to the end of his life. Subsequently, in order to accentuate his scorn for Michael, the chronicler wrote, reporting Michael's death: "Michael Mirianisdze, Patriarch, "Chkondidel-mtsignobartukhutsesi"", died and nobody mourned his death".

Golaghat Convention

The Golaghat Convention was a historic national convention of the people of Assam, organised in Golaghat for 2 days from 13–14 October 1985.
The 2 days' convention led to the formation of Assam's first major political party under the name and style of Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), and formally launched in Golaghat on 14 October 1985.
After intense negotiations with the then New Delhi government, headed by the prime minister "Rajiv Gandhi", the All Assam Students Union (AASU) agreed to sign–off the Assam Accord with the government on 15 August 1985.
History.
The Indian National Congress mostly dominated the electoral history of Assam from the first election of 1952. For many years, the citizens of Assam were raising the demand for steps against the illegal foreign immigrants who had entered the state of Assam through the porous border, mostly from Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan) and occupied areas of the state, thus threatening the economic, political, social and cultural existence of the indigenous people of the state.
The All Assam Students Union (AASU), under the leadership of "Prafulla Kumar Mahanta" (President) and late "Bhrigu Kumar Phukan" (General Secretary), and the All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad (AAGSP), reached out to the union Government of India demanding removal of several million illegal infiltrators from across the borders. This rapidly turned into a social movement throughout the state, and the Assam Movement was born in 1979.
Continued for six long years until 15 August 1985 when it culminated with signing of "Assam Accord", led to a realization of constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards. for Assam among the participants and Assamese citizens, resulting the "Golaghat Convention".
The convention held for 2 days, highlighted the regional aspirations that emerged out of the "Assam Movement" and formally recorded as part of the "Assam Accord" and emphasized the need to consolidate political power in Assam's politics by instituting a major regional political party. Thus, AASU transformed itself into Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) on 14 October 1985 in Golaghat. AASU's President Prafulla Kumar Mahanta was elected as the President of the AGP. Smaller parties and organisations such as "Asom Jatiyabadi Dal", "Purbanchaliya Loka Parishad" and Asam Sahitya Sabha regrouped with the AGP. The AGP swept the 1985 Assembly elections, thereby forming the government in Assam that year.
Principles.
The base for the electoral realignment, leading to the formation of AGP in this convention, was set up via the principles of Assam Movement of 1979–85. Thus, the core principles of the convention were, but not limited to the following:

He began his career as a high school bilingual social studies and mariachi music teacher, and then as a principal, both in Tucson, Arizona.
Carranza was the Northwest Region superintendent for the Clark County School District in Las Vegas. He served the San Francisco Unified School District, first as deputy superintendent and then as superintendent, where he was accused in 2015 of creating a hostile environment for women.
Houston Independent School District.
He was the superintendent of the Houston Independent School District (HISD) beginning in fall 2016. Carranza, who had signed a contract to serve for three years, served in this capacity until April 2018, when he was hired as New York City Schools Chancellor with a $345,000 salary. He announced his acceptance of the new job in March of that year. Observers in the Houston area were not aware that Carranza was seeking to exit his position with HISD: He publicly stated that he and the board members of HISD did not have problems with one another.
Doris Delaney, a monitor of HISD appointed by the Texas Education Agency (TEA), wrote a report stating that the former superintendent in fact disliked and felt frustration in reaction to actions taken by HISD board members. The report stated that Carranza disliked how the board was unable to deliberate important issues, overstepped its authority, and included members with inappropriate political desires.
New York City.
In 2018, the de Blasio administration initiated a plan to eliminate New York City's specialized high school exam, which is available to all middle school students in the city. In June 2018, defending the plan, Carranza stated that "I just don't buy into the narrative that any one ethnic group owns admission to these schools." Asian-American groups decried this as anti-Asian racism, considering that a disproportionately large number of students admitted to the city's eight specialized schools are of Asian descent. They believe their children are being targeted for their success on the exam. Alumni, activists and Asian American groups argued that Chancellor Carranza failed to appreciate the socio-economic and other diversity among these students and internal to communities of Asian descent. Carranza refused to apologize for the remarks.
In June 2019 nine members of the New York City Council wrote a letter to Mayor Bill de Blasio asking him to dismiss Carranza, accusing him of having divisive actions. In response, twenty-three Council members, including the education committee chair, sent a letter to the mayor in support of Carranza.
In May 2020, it was reported that under Carranza, the Department of Education downplayed the coronavirus threat as it was closing schools. Students presumed sick from the virus were left unrecorded, and teachers and parents were deprived of information by supervisors on students and staff who were presumed sick. The teachers union contends that the DOE was not complying with state protocols. As of May 11, 74 NYC Department of Education employees had died due to COVID-19.
Carranza resigned as Chancellor of New York City Schools, on March 15, 2021. The abrupt move came after disagreements between Mayor Bill de Blasio and Mr. Carranza over school desegregation policy reached a breaking point. He was replaced by Meisha Porter, a longtime city educator, then the Bronx executive superintendent, who is the first Black woman to lead the sprawling system, which has over 1 million students and 1,800 schools.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Carranza argued that parents should opt school children out of standardized testing, saying "We do not want to impose additional trauma on students that have already been traumatized."

Avengers Campus

Avengers Campus is a Marvel Cinematic Universe–themed area located at Disney California Adventure, and being developed for Walt Disney Studios Park at Disneyland Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland. The Marvel-themed areas or "lands" will be developed simultaneously at the three parks and inspired by the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, they will instead take place in the "Marvel Theme Park Universe", an alternate universe parallel to it within the Marvel Multiverse, in which the Blip and related ensuing events introduced in "" did not occur. They are designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, in collaboration with Marvel Studios and Marvel Themed Entertainment.
These three parks all hosted a Marvel-themed seasonal event in the past, which confirmed the demand for the integration of Marvel characters in the parks.
Based on three different continents, the Marvel-themed areas will be defined as the "Super Hero campus" of their specific region, that will form guests to become heroes. Each area will feature mostly different sets of attractions and entertainment, while being strongly interconnected with each other by sharing a common narrative.
Disney California Adventure.
Avengers Campus at Disney California Adventure is centered around an Avengers campus located on the former shared grounds of a Stark Industries plant and Strategic Scientific Reserve complex. The area takes up the space previously occupied by A Bug's Land—with using the same show building that previously housed the It's Tough to Be a Bug! attraction—as well as absorbing the nearby attraction that was previously designated in Hollywood Land. 
A Bug's Land closed on September 5, 2018, to make way for the new area. At the 2017 D23 Expo, Disney announced the Guardians of the Galaxy attraction would be joined by Spider-Man and the Avengers as part of the new immersive superhero-themed area at the park. Disney initially announced on March 11, 2020, that Avengers Campus would open on July 18, 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In late December 2020, Disney announced that Avengers Campus was scheduled to open in 2021. Due to a 1994 contract with Universal Parks &amp; Resorts, Disney cannot use the "Marvel" name in the park's branding or attractions. In April 2021, Disney announced that the area would open on June 4, 2021.
Walt Disney Studios Park.
The version at Walt Disney Studios Park (Disneyland Paris) will be taking over the Backlot area of the park, repurposing it with the Marvel theme. It will include a re-theme of WDS' RNRC to feature Iron Man. On December 10, 2018, it was announced that Walt Disney Studios Park would feature a Marvel area similar to the one coming to Disney California Adventure, receiving the same Spider-Man ride (taking over the Armageddon spot, which closed on April 1, 2019).
Hong Kong Disneyland.
The version at Hong Kong Disneyland was announced in 2016, as part of the park's expansion plan. It will take over part of Tomorrowland and will be themed as the Stark Expo based in Hong Kong, where guests are asked to join the Super Heroes in their battles. This version entered phase 2 in 2019, which includes in the Science and Technology Pavilion of Stark Expo, along with a new retail facility and themed food. This new attraction joined the Iron Man Experience, which opened in 2017 and took up the area where the former Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters attraction used to be. On top of this, there will be new attractions and other forms of entertainment added to the land up until the year 2023, when a brand new Avengers themed ride will open, taking over the area previously occupied by Autopia.

Biofactories

The name biofactory comes from the improvements which different installments of traditional health services (wastewater treatment and water treatment plants) have been through; this has been done by reassessing them into a Circular Economy (CE). The concept was first used by Chilean company Aguas Andinas’ CEO, Narcís Berberana. Yves Lesty, Carlos Castro and Lisette Gajardo were the engineers that took part in its origin.
Overall, biofactories have gone from a lineal processing approach, where resources are extracted and then processed, thus generating waste; to factories that supply with new valuable resources, such as electricity, natural gas, agricultural fertilizer or clean water, which are obtained from what it used to be considered as waste.
The first biofactory complex was created in 2017 by Aguas Andinas, when this new strategy was applied to its different wastewater treatment plants, La Farfana and Mapocho-Trebal; and La Florida water treatment plant, grouping them all together under the name of Biofactoría Gran Santiago.
During its first year, Biofactoría Gran Santiago generated a total of 51.792.240 kWh of electrical energy, 160.337 BTU of biogas, 111.842 tonnes of fertilizer destined to agricultural crops, and 603 millions cubic metre of clean water that was returned to its natural sources.
Principles.
According to the company that coined this new concept, biofactories operate under 6 main principles:
Acknowledgements.
In September 2018, Aguas Andinas’ biofactory project was awarded with the Momentum for Change recognition, given by the United Nations (UN) during its Climate Change conference; acknowledging its contribution to this new strategy that seeks to prevent climate change. 
Furthermore, in October 2018, Chilean foundation Recyclápolis gave its Recyclápolis Environmental National Award to Biofactoría Gran Santiago’s biomethanation plant, implemented by Chilean companies Metrogás and Aguas Andinas.

Cumulative quantities (logistics)

Cumulative quantities are a concept in logistics that involves adding up required materials quantities over a defined time-window that can be drawn as a 'cumulative curve'. This concept is applied in serial production and mainly used in the automotive industry to plan, control and monitor production and delivery. The concept is sometimes called 'Cumulative Production Figures Principle' (CPGP). 
Closed-loop-cycle.
The Concept of Cumulative Quantities (CCQ) uses the feedback mechanism of a closed loop, which can be found in industrial, engineering and electronic systems. The target requirements are summarized for each time-interval and compared with the actual values for closed-loop control. Positive cumulative deviation for a certain time-interval requires no further order, while negative deviations require a new order. To "calm" production and material flow upper and lower tolerance boundaries are defined and only if these boundaries are violated is a renewed order.
To check the entire production and material flow 'reporting limits' can be defined at a chosen counting point and if a limit is exceeded a concerned 'alert' is issued. The logistics staff has to explain the reason for the 'alert'. If the reason is correct and traceable no further action is needed. If mistakes are present in the database, data processing or in data-acquisition appropriate counter-measures are needed. Examples for mistakes or failures wrong primary demand or bad forecasting, mistakes in Bill of Material or master data, old Master Production Schedule, inaccurate or delayed data acquisition, calculation mistakes, mounting of incorrect parts at assembly line.
Counting points.
Target-actual-control-loop uses exactly defined counting points that demarcate the next-following intervals along the supply chain. The cumulative differences of next-following counting points show the quantities of material items which traverse the Interval and therefore offer transparency of the inventory of an item along the entire supply chain.
Supply chain.
Cumulative quantities are a part of official EDI-formats (e.g. EDIFACT - DELFOR) that are widely used by OEMs and their suppliers. Normally the data acquisition at 'goods receipt' are used for communication between consignee and goods dispatcher.

Kerala State Housing Board

Kerala State Housing Board (Abbreviation: KSHB) is a Kerala governmental group that provides direction and planning in housing activities. It was established under Act 19 of 1971.
History.
Before the board, governmental and non-governmental agencies executed house building projects without co-ordination. Housing Minister's Conferences in 1957 and in 1961 recommended the establishment of a Housing Board/Corporation in every state. The Trivandrum City Improvement Trust Act in 1960 provided the framing and execution of housing projects to the city of Trivandrum. The town planning act 1108 (Act IV of 1108) applies only to the city of Travancore-Cochin area while the Madras Town Planning Act, 1920 (Madras Act VII of 1920), applies to the Malabar area. They contain certain provisions for framing and executing housing projects. Those provisions proved inadequate to meet the requirements.
Hence the Government considered it necessary to enact a comprehensive law applicable to the whole State providing organized direction and planning in the preparation and execution of housing and improvement projects and for a State Housing Board to co-ordinate the State's various housing projects. The Kerala State Housing Board Ordinance, 1970 (24 of 1970) was enacted and the Housing Board was constituted in 1971, by merging Trivandrum City Improvement Trust.
Organisation.
The Housing Board is governed by a Director Board headed by a Chair. Official members are appointed by the Government of Kerala and non-official members are nominated by the State Government. The Housing Commissioner is the ex-officer Secretary of the Kerala State Housing Board. Administration is vested in the Board, constituting 17 members, namely the Chair, Housing Commissioner cum ex-officer secretary, 4 official members and 11 non-official members. The KSHB consists of 39 offices with its head office at Thiruvananthapuram. The three Regional offices are at Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikkode and 14 division offices in all 14 districts. Two project divisions are in Trivandrum and Kochi. The Technical wing consists of 175 Engineers led by the Chief Engineer while the ministerial wing consists of 350 officers/ staff up to the Additional Secretary.
Projects.
KSHB implemented various housing construction and lending projects for various income groups. It includes Economically Weaker Section (EWS), Low Income Group (LIG), Middle Income Group (MIG) and High Income Group (HIG). It further organized general improvement projects such as commercial office complexes, Government-directed rental housing, slum improvement, housing complex for EWS, rehabilitation housing, revenue towers etc.
MN One Lakh House.
This project was launched in early 1972. It was the first major attempt in India to provide adequate accommodation to very poor, landless agricultural labour families who had not received homesteads under the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963 as amended in 1969. The entire amount spent for the purchase of land and development of house-sites was received as subsidy from the Government of India.
Innovative Housing.
A housing project was formed in the 11th five-year plan, under 2nd years programme (2008-2009). It was proposed to construct residential flats on government land for the displaced labourers in the EWS of urban area. The sites were Thrikkakara, Ernakulam and Poojappura, Trivandrum.
Rajiv One Million Housing.
Rajiv One Million Housing Project was introduced in 1992-97. Under this project 1% of houses constructed for EWS was reserved for Physically Handicapped Persons.
Tsunami Housing.
A tsunami affected Kerala coastal areas in 2004. KSHB was designated as the lead agency for the provision of coastal housing and re-settlement. The Government entrusted the construction of houses to KSHB. The Board constructed 1204 houses at Thiruvananthapuram (31), Kasaragod (270), Kannur (128), Kozhikode (567), Malappuram (208), temporary shelters at Kollam (200).
Suraksha Housing.
The project is to give financial assistance for homeless EWS in urban and rural areas. Assistance was to be given to persons owning at least 2 cents of land to construct a house by themselves. The project has an option to associate Voluntary Agencies and NGOs to assist the construction.
Many projects were further implemented to waive housing loans in 2009.
Housing for NoRKs.
In 2017 the KSHB planned to launch a special project for Non-Resident Keralites (NoRKs) employed abroad. The government came out with a package to provide accommodations for the five-lakh odd homeless in the State. The project took cues from the one lakh housing project, Laksham Veedu Padhathi.

Time Was (novella)

Time Was is a time travel romance novella by British author Ian McDonald, published on 24 April 2018 by Tor Books.
Plot.
London book dealer Emmett Leigh discovers a love letter, written from Tom to Ben, in a World War II-era book of poetry, "Time Was" by E.L. After selling the book and posting the letter to online war history groups, Emmett is contacted by Thorn Hildreth, who produces a 1941 diary entry from her great-grandfather, Rev Anson Hildreth, which mentions close friends Tom and Ben at the Heliopolis Club in Alexandria, and is accompanied by photos of the men. Emmett's friend Shahrzad Hejazi at the Imperial War Museum in London recalls and finds a photo of Tom and Ben taken in July 1915, as well as an eyewitness account of them, identified by name, disappearing together into an otherworldly portal. Shahrzad also retrieves a photo of them from a documentary shot in Bosnia in 1995, in which they seem only a decade or so older than the one taken in 1915. Emmett and Thorn hypothesize that Tom and Ben are "emortal"—they age slowly, but are not immortal, in that they can die. Emmett and Thorn—now lovers themselves—travel to Paris to retrieve the copy of "Time Was" Emmett sold. They learn that the old bookstores which possess copies of the book have generations-old instructions to never sell them, and to pass them along to other bookshops should theirs close. In addition to the one sold by Emmett, the Paris bookstore has their own copy, in which Emmett and Thorn find a letter from Ben to Tom, written in Nanking in 1937. They realize that the men are time travelers, and use the books to communicate. Emmett determines that all known copies of "Time Was" are held by five bookshops across the world, in Paris, Lisbon, New York, Brussels, and Rome. With further research online and at museums, he discovers multiple traces of Tom and Ben throughout the 19th and 20th century, the earliest of which is in 1856. His obsession with the project has a negative impact on his health. Applying quantum mechanics to the fact that the highest incidence of traces of the men is between 1935 and 1949, Emmett deduces that they are time travelers from the past, not the future. Watching the documentary, Thorn's grandfather, Leland, is able to identify Tom's accent as coming from Woodbridge, Suffolk. This leads Emmett to a purported 1980 UFO sighting at RAF Woodbridge, and a 1940s incident at a hamlet named Shingle Street, which Emmett guesses is Tom and Ben's departure point.
In the early 1940s, Royal Engineer Tom Chappell and Royal Air Force scientist Ben Seligman, a new arrival to RAF Bawdsey, lock eyes at a pub. They are soon romantically involved, in secret. A test of Ben's secret military project, seeking cloaking technology, appears successful, which leads to a larger attempt. This experiment creates a time vortex into which Tom and Ben are drawn.
In the present, Regenbald Howe, the caretaker of the Martello tower at Shingle Street, knows of Chappell and Seligman, who were stationed at RAF Bawdsey during World War II. He produces a diary, left anonymously for the Chappell family in 1980, in which Tom describes a military scientific experiment gone awry. Regenbald has also amassed countless eyewitness accounts, personal notes, and legends about the event. Over the next few years, the Paris and Brussels bookstores close, but Emmett keeps track of their copies of "Time Was", both in Rome. He reads of a strange storm in Cyprus, which he believes to be one of Tom and Ben's portals. Tom arrives at one of the bookshops, and recognizes a stunned Emmett as the E.L. who wrote "Time Was". Sometime in the near future, Emmett will become a time traveler himself, and meet a young Tom before the experiment. Emmett tells Tom that Ben died in a ship sunk by torpedoes.
Themes.
"Time Was" touches on a necessarily secret homosexual romance in the World War II-era, with "Booklist" adding that it "captures the emotional nuances of a decades-long love while exploring issues of military and scientific might and the state of the contemporary book industry."
Publication.
In April 2016, the novella was announced as "Time There Was", to be released in 2017. By October 2017, the title had changed to "Time Was", with an April 2018 publication date. It was released on 24 April 2018.
Reception.
In "Library Journal", Kristi Chadwick called the story "elegant and delightedly romantic", and praised its "exciting, timeless finish." "Booklist" wrote that "This tiny novel packs a huge emotional punch as layers upon layers are revealed." "Publishers Weekly" called the novella compelling and vivid, noting that "The ending's predictability is washed away by beautiful writing that mixes Emmett's excitement with melancholy". Writing for "Locus", Gary K. Wolfe called "Time Was" "one of the most purely beautiful pieces" of McDonald's writing, and praised the device of communicating through bookstores as "both ingenious and romantic in its own way".
In January 2019, "Time Was" was nominated for a Philip K. Dick Award.

C. S. Blachs Enke &amp; Co.

C. S. Blachs (Blacks) Enke &amp; Co. was a trading house and shipping company based in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was founded in 1727 and became one of the largest Danish shipping companies after it was taken on by Erich Erichsen in 1783. It struggled after the turn of the century and went bankrupt in 1833.
History.
The company was founded by Oluf Blach (1694-1767) in 1727. It traded on the Danish colonies, especially the Danish West Indies. Blach served as managing director of the General Trading Company from 1767. 
After Blach's death in 1767, the company was continued by his son, Christen Schaarup Black (1737-1783). He established a partnership with Niels Ryberg in the 1760s, but it ended in 1775. 
He died just 46 years old in 1781. His widow, Johanne Black (1747-1800), married Erich Erichsen in 1783. The company was from then on registered as C. S. Blacks Enke &amp; Co. Erich Erichsen was for a while in partnership with his brother, Peter Erichsen, who was married to Peter Applebye's granddaughter, Anna Agathe Nancy. Trade on the Danish West Indies was still the central part of the company's activities. It completed 32 expeditions to the Danish West Indies in the period from 1747 to 1807. Erichsen was, for a while, a member of the board of directors of the Danish Asiatic Company.
Several of the company's ship were captured by privaters during the English Wars. It went bankrupt in 1833.
Location.
In 1807, Blach &amp; Co. owned a warehouse at present-day Bådsmandsstræde 6/Overgaden neden Vandet 51s in Christianshavn and another warehouse at Christianshavns Voldgade 1-3/Overgaden oven Vandet 2 og 2 A.

The Gambia in World War II

During the Second World War (1939–1945), the Gambia was part of the British Empire as the Gambia Colony and Protectorate. At the outbreak of war between the British Empire and Nazi Germany in September 1939, the Gambia was home to the Gambia Company of the Royal West African Frontier Force (RWAFF).
Risk of invasion.
After the Fall of France in 1940, the Gambia's neighbour Senegal aligned with the pro-German Vichy France regime. In September 1940, the Allies attempted but failed to capture Senegal in the Battle of Dakar. The failure of this increased the risk of an Axis invasion of the Gambia. In 1941, Lord Lloyd, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, asked for General Staff to draw up an Appreciation on Africa. In February 1941, this was completed and sent to Lloyd and Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. It made an assessment on the defence of British possessions in Africa, and stated that "The Gambia is not one of our essential possessions, and its capture by an enemy would not materially harm our prestige." The report noted that its proximity to Dakar made it "particularly vulnerable to attack by Vichy" and called for plans to be drawn up in the event of an attack, including an evacuation scheme.
Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord, partially objected to the assessment of the Gambia's importance. In a letter dated 3 March 1941, he wrote: "While this may be strictly true, Bathurst is of some naval value as a fuelling point for naval vessels of low endurance which cannot reach Freetown, and the Admiralty is erecting oil fuel stores there." The Chiefs of Staff Committee approved a report by the Joint Planning Staff on the evacuation of the Gambia at a meeting on 22 March 1941.
Home front.
Home defence.
The Gambia Local Defence Volunteers were founded in the war. It was later renamed as the Gambia Home Guard.
The Gambia Naval Volunteer Force, part of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR), was raised in 1935. In March 1938, it had six officers - five lieutenants, and Lieutenant Commander Alexander Skinner, the commanding officer.
Domestic politics.
On 13 November 1941, members of the Bathurst Advisor Town Council (BATC) voted for Edward Francis Small to be appointed to the Legislative Council to replace the late W. D. Carrol. Small served from 1 January 1942, becoming the first Gambian member elected to the Legislative Council.
Governance.
At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Thomas Southorn was the Governor of the Gambia, having been appointed to the role in October 1936. In March 1942, Hilary Blood was appointed as Governor and continued to serve until March 1947.
Economy.
In 1940, the British passed the Colonial Development and Welfare Act 1940, which provided funding to research efforts in the colonies. In July 1941, a commission of inquiry was launched to investigate the wages of manual labourers in the Gambia. It was decided that a minimum wage for workers in Bathurst should be set. Also, during the war, a full income tax was established in the Gambia along with other West African British territories. Kenneth Blackburne, then Colonial Secretary, published a report in 1943 that assessed the long-term and immediate economic needs of The Gambia. It examined how best to use post-war funds from the Colonial Development and Welfare Act. Many of its recommendations were ignored, but it served as a blueprint for development from 1945 to 1950.
Domestic military presence.
RAF Bathurst.
RAF Bathurst was formed in March 1941. It initially included three bases of operation, at Half-Die, Jeswang, and Yundum. A detachment from the anti-submarine No. 95 Squadron RAF was based at Bathurst from March 1941 to March 1943, before relocating wholly to Bathurst and remaining there until 30 June 1945. No. 95 Squadron was created to operate Short Sunderland flying boat patrol bombers. The biggest threat that the Squadron faced were Vichy French fighter aircraft based in Senegal, so in July 1941 it formed a Hawker Hurricane fighter wing.
In October 1941, this fighter wing became No. 128 Squadron RAF. A detachment of this Squadron was based in Jeswang from October 1941 to March 1943.
Other units based at RAF Bathurst include No. 228 Squadron RAF, from 28 August to 26 October 1941, and a detachment from No. 270 Squadron RAF from November 1942 to July 1943.
On 11 November 1943, a Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR) Catalina IB with the callsign FP122 crashed in the river while coming in to land at RAF Bathurst. All five crewmembers were killed.
RAF Yundum.
RAF Yundum was primarily home to No. 200 Squadron RAF. It was also home to No. 82 Squadron, No. 128 Squadron, No. 541 Squadron, the HQ of No. 295 Wing, and No. 54 Staging Post. The airfield is now Banjul International Airport.
Medical aid and hospitals.
The Gambia was home to a number of military hospitals during the Second World War. 55 British General Hospital was stationed in Bathurst from April 1941 to May 1942, 40 British General Hospital was stationed there from May 1942 to May 1943, and 55 British General Hospital was again stationed in Bathurst from January 1945 to January 1946. A Red Cross Committee was also founded in the Gambia in order to assist British soldiers detained in French West Africa.
Gambia Regiment.
The Gambia Regiment was formed out of the Gambia Company of the Royal West African Frontier Force (RWAFF) in 1940. Originally at battalion strength, in 1941 a second battalion was also raised. The 1st Battalion served in the Burma Campaign from 1944 to 1945.
1943 visit of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Franklin D. Roosevelt, the President of the United States, visited the Gambia in 1943. He was appalled by the poverty he encountered in Bathurst and the experience contributed to his growing antipathy towards the British Empire.
Connection to HMS "Gambia".
The Colony-class light cruiser HMS Gambia, which saw active service during World War II, took its name from the colony. It maintained a connection with the Gambia throughout its service, and on 28 May 1943, called at Bathurst when it was en route to Cape Town.
Legacy.
The Gambia is also home to Fajara War Cemetery, now maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which contains 203 Commonwealth burials from World War II, four of which are unidentified.

Biography.
Morris was born on November 12, 1928 in Chicago. Morris grew up on the South Side of Chicago and had classical piano lessons in her childhood.

In 1955 she sang with Charlie Spivak and in 1956 with Claude Thornhill in the NBC television show "Moonlight in Vermont". She recorded her first album in 1955 for the RCA sub-label "X" ("Bistro Ballads", with Johnny Pate); the following year for Bethlehem Records ("The Voice of Audrey Morris" with arrangements by Marty Paich).
She was offered the opportunity to record an album of film theme music for Warner Brothers. In the following years, she continued to perform locally. She was the leader of a trio at London House, a jazz piano club. In the late 1960s, she limited her performances to her family. In 1981 she had another engagement at Palmer House.
In 1985, she released the album "Afterthoughts" (with Stu Genovese). In the field of jazz, she was involved between 1955 and 2001 in twelve recording sessions.

Vordenstein park

The Vordenstein domain is a park in the Belgian municipality of Schoten, northeast of Antwerp. It separated from the adjacent Peerdsbos forest by the E19 highway to the North.
History.
The Vordenstein domain was created ib the 14th century out of the "Hof ter Katen" and the "Hof van de Werve". At that time, the domain had a mainly agrarian function, with the feudal lord leasing patches of the land to various farmers. Starting in the 18th century, the domain gradually evolved into a recreational estate with a castle and an extensive pleasure garden, owned by a succession of wealthy families from Antwerp as a countryside retreat. In 1980 the majority of the park was eventually bought by the Belgian state, and subsequently opened to the public. A smaller part in the middle of the domain remains privately owned by the De Pret family that inherited the domain at the beginning of the 20th century. 
Layout.
The majority of the present day layout stems from the 18th and 19th centuries. The oldest part of the park, the so-called "Sterrenbos" in the northeastern corner, was laid out in a baroque and geometrical fashion, inspired by the French gardens of Versailles. At the end of the 18th century, a forest in romantic style was planted in the middle of the park. The southwestern part of the domain was laid out in 1850 as an English landscape garden, with a pond, patches of trees and exotic plants. In the southeast lies the vegetable garden and the orangerie, which was built in the early 19th century, and is now used as a cafe. The forests in the northwest and the east were only planted at the end of the 19th century on what had been land used for farming.

Hawk Larabee

Hawk Larabee is an American old-time radio western. It was broadcast on CBS from July 5, 1946, until February 7, 1948.
Format.
In his book, "On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio", radio historian John Dunning described "Hawk Larabee" as "radio's first half-hearted attempt at an adult western drama, a concept that was not fully realized until the arrival of "Gunsmoke" five years later." Although adults listened to earlier radio westerns, such as "The Lone Ranger" and "Red Ryder", the main audience for those programs was children. Another radio historian, Jim Cox, wrote in his book, "Say Goodnight, Gracie: The Last Years of Network Radio", that "Hawk Larabee" "fell short in providing the stark realism of a grown-up narrative."
A summer replacement for "The Adventures of Maisie", the program began as "Hawk Durango", with the main character having that name. Those episodes focused on the adventures of Durango and his partner, Brazos John. After six weeks, the program ended. On October 3, 1946, "Hawk Larabee debuted", with the title character being the owner of Black Mesa Ranch. Larabee and his partner, Somber Jones, encountered adventures in and around the town of Sundown Wells. Larabee often found himself accused of crimes that he had not committed and thus had to solve the crimes to save himself from misfortune.
Personnel.
The changes in title and format were accompanied by a change in who had the title role. Elliott Lewis played Hawk Durango, with Barton Yarborough as Brazos John. In the "Hawk Larabee" program, Yarborough played the title role, while Barney Phillips portrayed Somber Jones. James Matthews was the announcer. William N. Robson was producer and director, and Richard Sanville was assistant director. Writers were Gomer Cool, E. Jack Neuman, Arthur E. Orlock, Dean Owen, and Kenneth Perkins.
Music was by Wilbur Hatch, and episodes incorporated singing by the Texas Rangers quartet. They sang the theme and provided bridges and background music for the broadcasts. Each episode also included three one-minute arrangements of songs in case some local stations wanted to insert commercials for the otherwise unsponsored program. In later episodes, Andy Parker's Plainsmen replaced the Texas Rangers.

1896 United States presidential election in Arkansas

The 1896 United States presidential election in Arkansas took place on November 3, 1896. All contemporary 45 states were part of the 1896 United States presidential election. Arkansas voters chose eight electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
This election marks the establishment of one-party hegemony in every county in Arkansas except Unionist Ozark Newton and Searcy where Republicans would control local government permanently. The new secret ballot and an onerous poll tax had already severely reduced black and poor white voting at the time of this election, in the process largely eliminating opposition party challenges.
Arkansas was won by the Democratic nominees, former U.S. Representative William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska and his running mate Arthur Sewall of Maine. Three electors cast their Vice Presidential ballots for Thomas E. Watson.

Hello, Universe

Hello, Universe is a 2017 novel written by Erin Entrada Kelly. The novel is told from the perspectives of four middle school students as one of them becomes trapped in a well. "Hello, Universe" won the 2018 Newbery Medal.
Writing.
The novel is told from four points of view: Virgil Salinas, a Filipino-American boy; Kaori Tanaka, a Japanese-American girl; Valencia Somerset, a girl in Virgil's class who is deaf; and Chet Bullens, the neighborhood bully. The narrative mostly takes place over the course of a single summer day. In an interview, Kelly said it was important to celebrate her Filipino culture: "Filipino culture isn't something that's necessarily prevalent in western literature, especially for kids." Kelly also cited Filipino folklore as an inspiration for the book.
Reception.
The book received a largely positive reception, including several starred reviews. Reviewers noted its well-written and diverse characters and relatable plot. A Kirkus starred review wrote of the "supremely well-crafted perspectives" of the four narrators. In a more mixed review, Sarah Hannah Gomez writing for the "Horn Book Magazine" stated, "while the ending may be a bit too tidy, the children’s inner lives are distinctive, and each rings true." The diversity presented by the characters and the low-key way this was handled was also praised in several reviews, including by Angie Bayne writing for the "Jefferson City News Tribune", "diversity is not treated as a plot point but just a point of fact."
Several reviews commented on the appeal of the book to children. Michelle Shaw writing for "School Library Journal," praised its wide appeal, "Readers across the board will flock to this book that has something for nearly everyone" while a starred "Booklist" review stated, "readers will be instantly engrossed."
"Hello, Universe" was announced as the 2018 Newbery Medal winner in February 2018. The selection committee noted that the book was "masterfully told through shifting points of view," adding that "this modern quest tale shimmers with humor and authentic emotion." Kelly called winning the Newbery among her proudest moments.
The German edition of "Hello, Universe" was awarded the 2019 Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis, the country's highest honor for children's literature.
Adaptation.
On 22 May 2019, it was announced that Netflix will adapt this novel into a feature film.

Adolphe Cicéron

Adolphe Marie Dieudonné Cicéron (28 May 1853 – 13 May 1928) was a French notary who was Senator of Guadeloupe from 1900 to 1912.
Early years.
Adolphe Cicéron was born in Blois, Loir-et-Cher, on 28 May 1853.
His parents were Adolphe Cicéron (1805–1872) and Thérèse Alexandrine Adeline Rodrigue.
He had three full sisters, and one half sister by his father's first wife.
His father was a notary.
His father had been appointed on 27 February 1840 to serve Saint-François, Guadeloupe, then on 4 April 1846 to Le Moule, Guadeloupe.
A decree of 20 December 1852 reinstated the elder Adolphe Cicéron as notary in Le Moule.
Ciceron also became a notary, but set up his practice in Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe, in 1878.
He was elected a municipal councillor of Pointe-à-Pitre in 1885, and was made deputy mayor.
In 1886 he was elected to the general council of Guadeloupe, and in 1896 became president of the general council of the department of Guadeloupe.
Senator.
Ciceron was elected to the senate for Guadeloupe in the first round on 7 January 1900 in a by-election. 
He won 186 votes out of 285.
He sat with the Democratic Left group.
Cicéron was in favour of reform of the colonial government and of a specific constitution for the colonies.
He often spoke in debates about the colonies, calling for treatment of the old colonies to be the same as metropolitan departments, and for irremovable colonial magistrates.
He was involved in debates over the tariffs on coffee in 1900, and prepared reports on the bill to extend the privileges of the colonial banks and on the bill to allow Pointe-à-Pitre to borrow money.
Ciceron was reelected in the triennial renewal of the senate on 4 January 1903, again in the first round, by 189 votes against 95 for his opponent.
He participated in debates over the proposed law on army recruitment and on the budgets of the colonies and the navy.
In 1910 he was rapporteur on subsidies granted to local budgets and reorganization of the Martinique communes after the 1902 earthquake.
On 5 July 1910 he protested against the pressure the administration had exerted during the Guadeloupe legislative elections, and opposed sending a cruiser to the island.
He was rapporteur of the colonial budget for 1911, and demanded equality in exchange of products with metropolitan France and improvements in customs arrangements, agricultural credits and port facilities.
Last years.
Ciceron ran for election in the renewal of 7 January 1912, but was defeated by Henry Bérenger.
Ciceron claimed that there had been electoral corruption by an unknown person, and said that Alexandre Saverdat, general councillor and agent of Hégésippe Légitimus, had received 50,000 francs by telegraph on 6 January 1912.
Despite the challenge, on 13 December 1912 the senate finally decided that Bérenger had won.
Ciceron died in Saint-Claude, Guadeloupe, on 13 May 1928 at the age of 75.

Bavarian Rummel

The Bavarian Rummel (; ) was the term used to downplay ("Rummel" means 'hustle and bustle') the warlike events in which Bavarian troops of Elector Maximilian II Emanuel invaded the County of Tyrol in 1703 during the War of the Spanish Succession.
Chronology.
On 19 June 1703, Bavarian troops besieged Kufstein. Fires broke out on the outskirts of the town, which engulfed the town itself, destroyed it and reached the powder store of the supposedly impregnable fortress. The enormous supplies of gunpowder exploded and Kufstein surrendered on 20 June. That same day, the Tyrolese surrendered in Wörgl; two days later Rattenberg was captured und Innsbruck was cleared on 25 June without a fight. But the Bavarians then suffered reverses at the hands of the Tyrolese on 1 July at the Pontlatzer Bridge in the upper Inn Valley, at the Brenner Pass and near Innsbruck. On 26 July, Saint Anne's Day, Tyrol was freed again and Maximilian Emanuel retreated to Bavaria via Seefeld in Tirol.
In 2011, during construction work in Pfons in the Wipptal valley, graves were uncovered, which were presumably those of Bavarian soldiers, who were not buried in the cemetery, but in threes near the river bank. The theory rests on clues that were mentioned in the local chronicle of Matrei am Brenner.
Tradition.
In gratitude for their freedom, in 1704 the "Landstände" pledged to have a St. Anne's Column built and this was erected in Innsbruck in 1706.
The Bavarian Rummel forms - together with the struggle for Tyrolean freedom in 1809, which regularly overshadows it both in expert and public discourse - was an important element of Tyrolean historical consciousness and Tyrolean identity and made a lasting contribution to the creation of the image of the "fighting Tyrolean farmer".

Austramathes squaliolus

Austramathes squaliolus is a species of moth in the family Noctuidae. It is endemic to New Zealand and is found only in the Chatham Islands on the Chatham, Pitt, Little Mangere and Rangatira Islands. The larvae of "A. squaliolus" is similarly patterned to the larvae of "A. fortis" and have lateral yellow markings that contrast with the dark dorsal marbling. However this marbling is darker in "A. squaliolus" in comparison to the lighter coloured "A. fortis. Melicytus chathamicus" is the larval host-plant for this species. The adult moth is again very similar in appearance to "A. fortis" and, as with "A. fortis," the black line curved at the forewing base is the distinguishing feature. However the two species are unlikely to be confused as their ranges do not overlap. The adult moths are on the wing in November and December and have been observed flying at dusk.
Taxonomy.
It was first described by Robert J. B. Hoare in 2017. The male holotype was collected by George William Gibbs as a larva on Rangatira Island and raised to adulthood. The specimen is held in the New Zealand Arthropod Collection.
Description.
The larvae of this species are bright coloured. They are similarly patterned to the larvae of "A. fortis" and have lateral yellow markings that contrast with the dark dorsal marbling. This marbling is darker in this species in comparison to the lighter "A. fortis".
The adult moth has a wingspan of between 25 - 31mm. In appearance the adult moth is again very similar to "A. fortis" and, as with "A. fortis," the black line curved at the forewing base is the distinguishing feature. The genitalia of the male of "A. squaliolus" differs from that of "A. fortis." The two species are unlikely to be confused as their ranges do not overlap.
Distribution.
This species is endemic to the Chatham Islands and is fairly common. It has been found on the following islands: Chatham, Pitt, Little Mangere and Rangatira.
Behaviour.
Adult moths are on the wing in the months of November and December. Adults have been observed flying at dusk in the vicinity of their larval host-plant.
Host-plant.
"Melicytus chathamicus" is the host plant for the larvae of this species.

Tekkal's parents came to Germany in the 1970s as immigrants from southeastern Turkey. In their homeland, they had been persecuted as Kurds and part of the Yazidi religious community. In Germany, her father worked as a tiler and her mother was a housewife. She is one of eleven siblings.
Tekkal was born in Hanover. In 1998 she graduated from high school and in 2002 she began to study political science and German language and literature at the Leibniz University of Hanover, graduating in 2007. In her master's thesis, which she completed with honors, she wrote about Kurdish Yazidis in the diaspora and the sociopolitical conditions of their integration, as well as with integration policy in Europe.
Career.
After her studies, Tekkal worked as an intern at the "German Orient Foundation" in Hamburg and began her career as a television journalist at RTL. She worked there as an editor and reporter for various formats such as Spiegel TV, "stern TV" and "Extra - Das RTL-Magazin". In 2010, she was awarded the Bavarian Film Prize for her reportage "Angst vor den neuen Nachbarn" (Fear of the New Neighbors) together with "Extra" editorial director Jan Rasmus.
Since 2014, she has worked as a freelance journalist, filmmaker, war correspondent and author. She has written two books published by "Berlin Verlag", which reached number 16 and 17 on the Spiegel bestseller paperback list, and has contributed to other publications as a guest author. She mainly deals with the topics of migration, integration and identity.
To make the documentary film "Háwar - Meine Reise in den Genozid" (Háwar, a cry for help), Tekkal traveled to Iraq in 2014. The film focuses on the destruction caused by ISIS and the genocide against the Yazidis living in northern Iraq, especially the violence against women. It premiered at the 49th Hof Film Festival in 2015. The documentary was shown in the German Bundestag, at the European Parliament and in a screening at the United Nations headquarters in New York City in 2017, as part of an event organized by the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretariat General on Sexual Violence in Conflict at the United Nations, the Permanent Mission of Germany to the UN, and the Permanent Mission of Iraq to the UN.
Her second film, "Jiyan - Die vergessenen Opfer des IS" (Jiyan - The Forgotten Victims of ISIS), premiered in January 2020 at Kino International in Berlin and was first broadcast on rbb Fernsehen in December of that year. In the documentary, Tekkal accompanies Najlaa Matto, a Yazidi woman freed from ISIS captivity, who returns to northern Iraq for the purpose of coming to terms with and prosecuting the crimes against her people. One of the central points of the film, in addition to taking stock of the destruction of lives, destinies and culture, is an appeal for human rights and a reminder of the international community's responsibility, as well as a demand that ISIS perpetrators be held accountable and brought before a criminal tribunal.
Tekkal is also active as a host, for example at the publication of the study "Taboo &amp; Tolerance" by the German Federal Ministry of Defense. Furthermore, she hosts several podcasts, such as the series "Vergessen: Die Frauenmorde von Juárez" (Forgotten: Femicides in Ciudad Juárez) with Leyla Yenirce or the DFB Foundations podcast, "Mehr als ein Spiel" (More than a Game), where she speaks to and about people who use soccer as a means of social, societal and cultural engagement.
Tekkal continues to serve as an honorary board member of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation.
Political career.
In 2016, Tekkal was part of Julia Klöckner's shadow cabinet in Rhineland-Palatinate and was expected to become the Federal Government Commissioner for Migration, Refugees and Integration in the Chancellery in the Fourth Merkel cabinet, but did eventually not receive the post. The following year, she was part of Bernd Althusmann's shadow cabinet. In 2019, she was appointed to the Federal Government's Commission on the Causes of Migration.
Since June 2021 she is an expert in the Bundestag at the public hearing of the Committee on Human Rights and Humanitarian Aid on the human rights situation in Turkey.
Her political positions include a pluralistic Germany based on the free democratic basic order, which counteracts extremism, especially Islamism and far-right politics. Furthermore, she is also in favor of a women's quota for companies.
Tekkal has been on delegation trips with various ministers, for example in 2019 with Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer in Iraq, or the year before with Development Minister Gerd Müller.
Social engagement.
HÁWAR.help e.V..
Together with her sister, the former professional soccer player Tuğba Tekkal, she founded the non-profit association for humanitarian aid Háwar.help and is its chairwoman. The association runs several projects centered around women's empowerment and women's rights. The project "Scoring Girls", which was initiated by her sister Tuğba, organizes soccer practice for girls from immigrant and disadvantaged families. The project's patron is journalist and TV presenter Anne Will. In 2021, Annalena Baerbock became a patron of the "Back to Life" project.
GermanDream education initiative.
In 2019, she also founded the "GermanDream" education initiative, which organizes dialogs about values at German schools. The aim is to teach young people the values of freedom and self-determination and to prevent extremism, particularly Islamism and right-wing extremism. In addition, Tekkal launched the hashtag #GermanDream on the social media platform Twitter, under which people with an immigrant background can share their life and success stories as an incentive for other immigrants.

Forest Bathing

Forest Bathing is the seventh studio album by A Hawk and a Hacksaw. It was released April 13, 2018. Prior to its release, the song "A Broken Road Lined With Poplar Trees" premiered on Under the Radar's website.
Album name and concept.
The term forest bathing refers to the Japanese concept of "Shinrin-yoku" (森林浴), a Japanese form of nature therapy. According to L.M. Dupli-cation, "This is not an urban music. It's rural; songs of the woods and roads where there are no sidewalks or street lamps to light your way. "A Broken Road lined with Poplar Trees" describes just this- the dirt from the summer sun, a melody from home on my tongue. The song "Babayaga" by Trost, is a tribute to the archetypal crone Babayaga, who sticks out her cane just as a child runs by... And "The Washing Bear" is a classic brass romp, connecting Serbian brass with Southern brothers in Albania and Turkey..."
The band cites the Valle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico as "their forest bath of choice."

Operation Garlic

Operation Garlic was an attack on the Dortmund-Ems Canal by 617 Squadron carried out on 14-16 September 1943. The operation was unsuccessful. The canal was not significantly damaged by the attack, while 617 squadron lost five of the eight aircraft and crews involved in the operation.
Concept.
The Dortmund-Ems Canal was a significant industrial highway, making it a suitable target. It was believed that if several 12,000lb bombs were dropped on the aqueduct at low level then it could be breached. The large bombs used had a poor aerodynamic design. To deliver them accurately they had to be dropped from a low level. For this reason, 617 Squadron was assigned the job of destroying the canal.
Raid.
The raid was undertaken by eight Avro Lancaster aircraft of 617 Squadron supported by six de Havilland Mosquito aircraft from 418 and 605 squadrons. The raid was scheduled for the night of 14/15 September however aircraft were recalled whilst over the North Sea due to fog and mist over the target. Whilst returning, Squadron Leader (S/Ldr) Maltby's aircraft hit the sea and all the crew were killed. Flight Lieutenant (F/Lt) Shannon and his crew circled the wreckage site for two hours waiting for rescue. Maltby's body was the only one recovered.
The attack was re-launched on the night of the 15/16. The point of attack was nearby to Munster where the canal divided into two branches. The attacking force was split into two groups with three Mosquitos for each four Lancasters plus an additional two reserve Lancasters, the main purpose of the Mosquitos being to defend the Lancasters from flak. The visibility on the raid was reported to be very bad, preventing accurate location of the target. 
All Mosquitos returned safely.
Aftermath.
The canal was eventually breached the following year. On the night of the 23/24 September 1944 aircraft of 617 Squadron attacked the canal using the more effective 12,000 lb tallboy bomb, which had a seismic effect that breached the canal. It remained out of service for the rest of the war.

RSocket is an application protocol initially developed by Netflix, that supports Reactive Streams. The motivation behind its development was to replace hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), which is inefficient for many tasks such as microservices communication, with a protocol that has less overhead.
RSocket is a binary protocol for use on byte stream transports such as TCP, WebSockets, and Aeron. It enables the following symmetric interaction models via async message passing over a single connection:
It supports session resumption, to allow resuming long-lived streams across different transport connections. This is particularly useful for mobile‹–›server communication when network connections drop, switch, and reconnect frequently.

IBM 4765

The IBM 4765 PCIe Cryptographic Coprocessor is a hardware security module (HSM) that includes a secure cryptoprocessor implemented on a high-security, tamper resistant, programmable PCIe board. Specialized cryptographic electronics, microprocessor, memory, and random number generator housed within a tamper-responding environment provide a highly secure subsystem in which data processing and cryptography can be performed.
The IBM 4765 is validated to FIPS PUB 140-2 Level 4, the highest level of certification achievable for commercial cryptographic devices. The IBM 4765 data sheet describes the coprocessor in detail.
IBM supplies two cryptographic-system implementations:
Toolkits for custom application development are also available.
Applications may include financial PIN transactions, bank-to-clearing-house transactions, EMV transactions for integrated circuit (chip) based credit cards, and general-purpose cryptographic applications using symmetric key algorithms, hashing algorithms, and public key algorithms.
The operational keys (symmetric or RSA private) are generated in the coprocessor and are then saved either in a keystore file or in application memory, encrypted under the master key of that coprocessor. Any coprocessor with an identical master key can use those keys.
Supported systems.
IBM supports the 4765 on IBM Z, IBM POWER Systems, and IBM-approved x86 servers (Linux or Microsoft Windows). 
History.
As of May 2011, the IBM 4765 superseded the IBM 4764 that was discontinued.
The IBM 4765 has been discontinued on all platforms. The successor to the 4765, the IBM 4767, was introduced on each of the IBM server platforms:

Sparky D

Doreen C. Broadnax, known professionally as Sparky D, or spelled Sparky Dee (born June 2, 1965) is an American hip–hop musician and rapper. Broadnax is noted as one of the first female battle rappers, first gaining attention through the Roxanne Wars; when she responded to Roxanne Shante's "Roxanne's Revenge" with "Sparky's Turn (Roxanne, You're Through)" in 1985.
Biography.
Early life.
Born in Brooklyn, Broadnax was born to a Caucasian mother and African-American father. Broadnax was raised in the Van Dyke Housing Projects in the Brownsville neighborhood.
Career.
Broadnax began her music career around 1983 when she became a member of a local hip-hop group, The Playgirls. The group, which consisted of Lisa (whose stage name was City Slim) and Mona (whose stage name was Mo Ski) recruited Broadnax to join after listening to her rap at a local hangout. After joining the group, The Playgirls recorded "Our Picture of a Man" for Sutra Records in 1983; later released in 1984. During her time with the group, Broadnax was introduced to rapper and music producer Spyder D. 
In 1984, 14-year-old rapper Roxanne Shante released "Roxanne's Revenge," a response to U.T.F.O.'s record "Roxanne, Roxanne," a song about a woman who would not respond to their advances. After listening to Shante's song on WBLS' Mr. Magic's Rap Attack on New Year's Eve 1985, Spyder-D decided that Broadnax would respond to Shante's record the following day. Taking offense to Shante's attack on a fellow Brooklyn crew, Broadnax responded with "Sparky's Turn (Roxanne You're Through)" under the NIA Records label; It was produced by Spyder-D. The single sold more than 300,000 copies in days of its release, later becoming certified gold.
This, in turn, kicked off the Roxanne Wars, is a well-known series of hip hop rivalries during the mid–1980s, yielding perhaps the most answer records in history. In 1985, capitalizing off the success of both records, Roxanne Shante and Broadnax released "Round One, Roxanne Shanté vs Sparky Dee" on Spin Records which included a battle track, in which the two rappers freestyle and diss each other. In subsequent years, Broadnax released a few tracks including d "He’s My DJ" b/w "She’s So Def" with Kool DJ Red Alert in 1985 and "Throwdown" in 1987. The year 1988 saw the release of her first full-length album on B-Boy Records, "This is Sparky D's World". Broadnax continues to stay active in the hip hop community, working with various old school artists on hip hop gospel records including MC Shy D, Spyder D, Roxanne Shante, Kool DJ Red Alert and K Wiz.
Personal and Legacy.
Broadnax has stated in interviews that she was a victim of domestic abuse, struggled with a crack cocaine addiction and was involved in prostitution sometime after the height of her career. In 2017, Broadnax was portrayed by Cheryse Dyllan in Netflix film "Roxanne, Roxanne", a biopic about the life of Roxanne Shante.

Healthcare in Oxfordshire

Healthcare in Oxfordshire is now the responsibility of Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group
History.
From 1947 to 1965 NHS services in Oxfordshire were managed by Oxford Regional Hospital Board. In 1974 the boards were abolished and replaced by regional health authorities. The county came under the Oxford RHA. Regions were reorganised in 1994 and Oxfordshire came under the Anglia and Oxford Regional Health Authority. Oxfordshire had two area health authorities from 1974 – West Berkshire and Oxfordshire. In 1982 it had only one district health authority. Regional health authorities were reorganised and renamed strategic health authorities in 2002. Oxfordshire was part of Thames Valley SHA. In 2006 regions were again reorganised and Oxfordshire came under NHS South Central until that was abolished in 2013. There was only one primary care trust for the area.
Sustainability and transformation plans.
The county is part of the Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West STP area. There are plans to replace the nine community hospitals in the county with four community hubs and to close 110 acute beds at Horton General Hospital. The Care Quality Commission reported in February 2018 that there were multiple problems with the inpatient discharge process. Over 71% of discharges were unplanned and some took place between 2am and 3am. Social care providers reported that they did not receive discharge summaries for over 50% of the patients referred to them. There was “little collaboration between system partners”.
Louise Patten was appointed the permanent chief executive of both Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire CCGs in January 2019, leading to suggestions that this might be followed by a merger.
Primary care.
There are 70 GP practices in the county.
Acute services.
Acute services are provided by Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. There are two hospitals with accident and emergency facilities: the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford and the Horton General Hospital in Banbury. The former is a major trauma centre.
Mental Health.
Mental health services are provided by Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust.

Norman Bertram Marshall

Norman Bertram Marshall, known as Freddy, (5 February 1915 – 13 February 1996) was a British marine biologist and ichthyologist who was worked at the British Museum (Natural History). His main interests were in the area of deep sea research.
Early life.
Freddy Marshall was born in the Cambridgeshire village of Great Shelford, where his family had lived for generations in a house built by his father; both his father and grandfather were builders. He was the eldest of four children, having two brothers and a sister. His father joined the Cambridgeshire Regiment and went to fight in the First World War in France before Freddy was born. From 1920 he attended the village's church school and in 1926 went to the Cambridge and County High School. During his school years Freddy was more interested in fishing than in his studies and narrowly avoided expulsion. However, he attained a Higher School Certificate with distinctions in zoology and botany.
Cambridge and early career.
In 1933 Marshall entered Downing College, Cambridge as an exhibitor, supported by scholarships from both the Cambridgeshire County Council and the Board of Education. He gained a double first in the Natural Sciences Tripos, having read Zoology Part II. As an undergraduate he was interested in embryology and this led to him being introduced by his professor John Stanley Gardiner to E.S. Russell, whose book "The Interpretation of Development and Heredity" Marshall had admired. Russell at the time was Director of Fisheries Investigations at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and they discussed fish biology but Marshall was set on pursuing his interest in embryology. However, Gardiner advised Freddy to broaden his horizons and introduced him to a Commander Hawkridge who had an office insuring fishing boats in Hull. Hawkridge was able to arrange berths for Marshall on fishing boats during his vacation, which allowed Marshall to visit the waters off Iceland three times and Bear Island and the Faroes once each. It was on these voyages that Marshall was first introduced to the macrourid fish on which he would become an authority. These trips may have had some influence on Marshall's decision to give up embryology and to apply for a post as a marine biologist in Hull.
Marshall was appointed to be part of Alister Hardy's Department of Zoology and Oceanography at University College, Hull in 1937. Here he became involved in research on plankton and spent many hours working on the reels of bolting silk which were used by Hardy's plankton recorders. The plankton was trapped in the silk which was concealed inside artificial herrings dragged behind commercial ships. He was particularly looking for the two indicator species of arrow worms.
He had been lodged in unsatisfactory accommodation in Hull and Jacob Bronowski suggested that Marshall move in to his lodgings. Here Marshall was given the nickname "Freddy" by Bronowski with whom he became friends and also met his landlady's daughter, Olga Stonehouse, whom he married in 1944. During his stay at these lodgings he also made friends with Cyril Lewis, who lived in the next street and, after Lewis moved to Edinburgh, Marshall stayed with him when he was posted to Hull's northern outpost in Leith.
Army service.
Marshall was commissioned in to the Royal Army Ordnance Corps in 1941 and stationed on the Thames for a while before being transferred, like many other biologists, into operation research. In 1944 he was seconded from the Army to the Colonial Office for special duties. David Lack informed him that Operation Tabarin was looking for volunteers suitable for manning Antarctic bases. Operation Tabarin was a British operation to deny the use of Antarctic islands and mainland to Axis forces and to reinforce British claims in the region.
Marshall contacted Brian Roberts who was coordinating the Operation and Roberts sent him to Canada to collect 25 huskies to be used in the Antarctic by the teams involved in Operation Tabarin. He flew to Labrador to collect the dogs on 19 September 1944, only ten days after his wedding to Olga. He returned to Liverpool on board a Free French cargo ship, the "Indochinois" accompanied by Surgeon Commander Edward W. Bingham, who had much more experience with huskies than Marshall. On arrival at Liverpool they and the dogs were transferred to the "RSS John Biscoe" to sail to the Antarctic, where he was based at Hope Bay as the zoologist.
Post-war career.
When Marshall returned to Hull in September 1946 he was able to spend a lot of his time at the British Museum (Natural History) working on his collection of fish from his time in the Antarctic. In the summer of 1947 Marshall was appointed to the Department of Zoology at the Museum. He replaced J.R. Norman, who had died in post, as an Assistant Keeper. For the next 25 years Marshall worked at the BM(NH) becoming a Special Merit Senior Scientific Officer in 1962. He travelled widely during his time at the Museum, spending time in the United States and on oceanographic expeditions on a number of research vessels. Following advice from Albert Eide Parr he specialised in studying the swim bladder, especially that of deep-sea fish. He also conducted a well received series of lectures at Harvard University and worked at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1963. He also worked at the University of Miami and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He was elected to Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1970.
He was awarded the Polar Medal in 1953 and in 1971 the Rosenstiel Gold Medal for services to Marine Biology. In 1972, Marshall left his position at the museum to become the Chair of Zoology at Queen Mary College, London University and remained in that post until he retired in 1977.
Marshall was the author of three major and influential books on marine biology, "Aspects of deep-sea biology" in 1954, "Explorations in the lives of fishes" in 1963 and "Developments in deep sea biology" in 1979. The text of these books written by Marshall was accompanied by illustrations by Olga. He was also the author of many scientific papers.
Personal life.
Marshall married Olga Stonehouse on 9 September 1944 and they had one son, Justin, also a marine biologist, and three daughters. While Marshall was working in London they lived in Saffron Walden where their house was built by his architect brother, Peter, from bricks left from a ruined coach house that had occupied the site. He was keen on music and while staying with Lewis in Edinburgh had developed an interest in the music of Donald Tovey. He also played golf, enjoyed Bach and took an interest in many subjects. He was friends with Arthur Koestler who often came to visit him and discuss literature and philosophy. In 1996 Marshall and Olga moved to Great Chesterford in Essex where he died suddenly on 13 February 1996 while working on a new book about simplicity in biology.
Legacy.
The grenadier "Coryphaenoides marshalli" and the needletooth cusk ("Epetriodus freddyi") are named after him, as is Marshall Peak in Antarctica, which was so named by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in recognition of Marshall's work on Operation Tarabin.

The Flash (season 5)

The fifth season of the American television series "The Flash", which is based on the DC Comics character Barry Allen / Flash, premiered on The CW on October 9, 2018, and concluded on May 14, 2019, with a total of 22 episodes. The season follows Barry, a crime scene investigator with superhuman speed who fights criminals, including others who have also gained superhuman abilities, as he deals with the consequences of his future daughter's time traveling. It is set in the Arrowverse, sharing continuity with the other television series of the universe, and is a spin-off of "Arrow". The season was produced by Berlanti Productions, Warner Bros. Television, and DC Entertainment, with Todd Helbing serving as showrunner.
The season was ordered in April 2018, and production began that July. Grant Gustin stars as Barry, with principal cast members Candice Patton, Danielle Panabaker, Carlos Valdes, Tom Cavanagh, and Jesse L. Martin also returning from previous seasons, while Hartley Sawyer, Danielle Nicolet, and Jessica Parker Kennedy were promoted to series regulars from their recurring status in season four. They are joined by new cast member Chris Klein while former series regular Keiynan Lonsdale makes a guest appearance. The series was renewed for a sixth season on January 31, 2019.

Production.
Development.
At the Television Critics Association winter press tour in January 2018, The CW president Mark Pedowitz said he was "optimistic" and "confident" about "The Flash" and the other Arrowverse shows returning next season, but added that it was too soon to announce anything just yet. On April 2, The CW renewed the series for its fifth season. Todd Helbing, who had previously served as a co-showrunner for the series' first four seasons, emerged as the series' first sole showrunner following Andrew Kreisberg's firing during the previous season.
Writing.
In October 2017, Kevin Smith revealed that then-executive producer Andrew Kreisberg already had plans for the next season of the show and had told him the story for "The Flash"s fifth season, which got Smith very excited and jokingly commenting, "I now have to stay alive one more year."
At San Diego Comic-Con 2018, Todd Helbing revealed that "legacy" would be a theme during the season, adding, "I think everybody's thinking about what it means after they leave." On the arrival of Barry and Iris' future daughter, Nora, Grant Gustin teased the different headspaces the characters would be in. "[Nora]’s kind of attached to [Barry] when she arrives and a little more distant with Iris," Gustin said. "It's a weird thing for Iris to see them bond so easily... obviously something happened in the future, which worries Iris," added Candice Patton. The season also sees Barry, Ralph, and Iris returning to their professional careers as a CSI, detective, and journalist, respectively. Patton noted that, "We live in such precarious times where we don't know what the truth is... I feel like [journalists] are superheroes... I hope that's a concept we bring to the show and give journalists the praise they deserve."
Helbing also revealed that there will be "a lot of deaths this season," and that the main antagonist would not be a speedster for the second season in a row. The new antagonist, Cicada, instead possesses powers that "present a challenge for Team Flash that they’ve never had to deal with before." He is not a cult leader as he is in the comics, but is portrayed as a "grizzled, blue-collar everyman whose family has been torn apart by metahumans" and who views the rise of metas as an epidemic, and seeks to exterminate them one by one.
Casting.
Main cast members Grant Gustin, Candice Patton, Danielle Panabaker, Carlos Valdes, and Jesse L. Martin return from previous seasons as Barry Allen / Flash, Iris West, Caitlin Snow / Killer Frost, Cisco Ramon / Vibe and Joe West, respectively. Tom Cavanagh also returned as a series regular, playing a new version of his character Harrison Wells, known as Sherloque Wells. Cavanagh also portrays Herr Wells of Earth-12 in the episode "The Death of Vibe", Harry Wells of Earth-2 in the episode "What's Past Is Prologue", and recurs as Eobard Thawne. The fifth season is the first not to feature Keiynan Lonsdale, who plays Wally West / Kid Flash, as a series regular since his introduction in the second season, following the character's move to "Legends of Tomorrow" during the previous season and Lonsdale's subsequent departure from that show as well. He appears only in the season premiere. In June 2018, Danielle Nicolet, Hartley Sawyer, and Jessica Parker Kennedy, who recurred during the previous season as Cecile Horton, Ralph Dibny / Elongated Man, and Nora West-Allen, respectively, were promoted to series regulars for the fifth season. Nicolet had additionally guest-starred at the end of the first season and had been recurring in the series since the third season. The season establishes that Nora's alias is XS, making her an amalgamation of Jenni Ognats / XS from DC Comics, and Barry and Iris' daughter in the comics, Dawn Allen. In July, Chris Klein also joined the main cast as Orlin Dwyer / Cicada, the season's main antagonist. Sarah Carter was cast to play an adult Grace Gibbons, who also adopts the Cicada persona.
Design.
The season introduces a new Flash suit, which Todd Helbing described as the series' most "accurate incarnation" of the Flash suit from the comics. The season also introduces Barry's "Flash ring" from the comics. The new suit adopts brighter colors than previous suits – which had maroon overtones – and, unlike prior incarnations, does not have a chin strap.
Filming.
Production for the season began on July 6, 2018, in Vancouver, British Columbia, and concluded on April 10, 2019. Danielle Panabaker made her directorial debut this season. Tom Cavanagh directed the eighth episode of the season, which served as the 100th episode of the series and led into the annual crossover. In October 2018, it was announced that Martin would take a medical leave from the series due to a back injury he sustained over the hiatus. Due to Martin's injury, the majority of his scenes in the first half of the season were shot depicting Joe seated. In January 2019, it was announced that Martin had returned from medical leave and that Joe would return in the fifteenth episode of the season.
Arrowverse tie-ins.
In May 2018, "Arrow" star Stephen Amell announced at The CW upfronts that the next Arrowverse crossover would feature Batwoman and Gotham City. The crossover "Elseworlds" has launched a 2019 solo series for the character.
Marketing.
The main cast of the season as well as executive producer Todd Helbing attended San Diego Comic-Con on July 21, 2018 to promote the season. Starting on September 14, 2018, several billboards advertising Ralph Dibny as a private investigator were seen around Vancouver, the city where the show is filmed.
Release.
Broadcast.
The season premiered on The CW in the United States on October 9, 2018. The annual crossover episode swapped time-slots with "Supergirl" for that week and aired on Sunday, December 9.
Home media.
The season began streaming on Netflix in the United States on May 22, 2019. The season was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 27, 2019.
Reception.
Critical response.
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 94% approval rating for the fifth season with an average rating of 7.73/10, based on 11 reviews. The website's consensus reads, ""The Flash"s fifth season maintains the show's high standard for compelling visuals, chilling villains, and well-scripted moments of humor, but also turns a more focused gaze on the role of family dynamics amongst the increasingly complex characters."
Reviewing for "Den of Geek", Mike Cecchini gave the premiere a rating of 4.5/5. He called it "a genuinely special episode" and "an excellent return to form for the series", naming it the best season premiere in the show's history, while directing specific praise to Gustin, Kennedy, and the show's composer Blake Neely. "IGN"s Jesse Schedeen also praised the addition of Kennedy, but expressed concern over the introduction of yet another speedster character, "especially with certain existing characters continuing to be so poorly served". He gave the episode a rating of 7.4/10, adding, "in a lot of ways, things do seem to be looking up for "The Flash". Unfortunately, there are plenty of other reminders that the series has chronic difficulties in juggling its ensemble cast." Chancellor Agard of "Entertainment Weekly" and Scott Von Doviak of "The A.V. Club" further praised Kennedy's performance, and gave the premiere a "B+" and "B" grade, respectively, with Agard concluding, ""The Flash" is now in its fifth season, which means the show's accumulated history is one of its greatest strengths it has. I'm glad it's finding both humorous fun and poignant ways to use it as we head towards the 100th episode."

Entrance to the Labyrinth

Entrance to the Labyrinth () is a 1989 Soviet five-episode television crime film directed by Valeriy Kremnev based on the Vayner Brothers novel "Medicine against Fear".
Plot.
The film consists of several storylines.
Main one occurs in the USSR in the 1980s - a detective story about scammers who, using a police identification card, break into the apartments of dishonest people and rob them under the guise of a search. When studying this case, investigator Muromtsev discovers a conflict between two inventors of miracle drug metaproptozole, called abroad as "medicine against fear". The professor does not believe in the existence of this drug because he did not succeed in inventing it himself. Therefore, he denies that his opponent Lyzhin, who is considered a kooky eccentric could invent such a drug. However, the criminals manage to poison the district plenipotentiary with this particular drug, after which they abduct the identity card and the government-issue weapons of the district police officer Pozdnyakov.
A parallel story tells about the life and tragic fate of the great physician and philosopher Paracelsus in the 16th century in Europe. In search of a mythical cure for all diseases, he makes discoveries, which form the basis of modern pharmacology. The life of Paracelsus is spent in constant wanderings.

Techno-animism

Techno-animism is a culture of technological practice where technology is imbued with human and spiritual characteristics. It assumes that technology, humanity and religion can be integrated into one entity. As an anthropology theory, techno-animism examines the interactions between the material and the spiritual aspects of technology in relation to humans. Techno-animism has been studied in the context of Japan, since techno-animism traces most of its roots to the Shinto religion, and also in DIY culture where Actor–network theory and non-human agencies have been labeled as techno-animist practices.
Background and history.
The practice of instilling human and spiritual characteristics into physical objects has always been part of the Shinto religion. Deities in the Shinto religion often symbolizes objects of the physical world and their statues often take human forms. With these practices, people form tighter bonds with physical objects. In Japanese culture, the interaction between humans and non-human objects is critical to the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature. A prime example of this type of interaction is that before meals, Japanese people always say "itadakimasu" which expresses gratitude for the ingredients of the meal may it be animals or plants.
Techno-animism builds upon the practices of the Shinto religion by instilling human and spiritual characteristics into technology. As for representation, techno-animism is often embodied in the engineering design of objects and the way that people interact with those objects. In a larger social context, Techno-animism provides a means for technology to be integrated into the human society because new technology can always be instilled with traditional values.
Examples of Techno-animism also exist within the context of the DIY ethic and Maker culture: linking contemporary theories of material agency and Material culture with post-modern ideas of Animism and ethnographies " with recent academic studies suggesting that a form of Techno-animism can be observed in the highly developed practices of material engagement present in certain Do it yourself sub-cultures recorded in contemporary ethnographic studies of technology.
Examples.
The design of certain objects can have human-related traits that illustrate techno-animism. A robot designed by Honda called ASIMO takes the form of an astronaut wearing a spacesuit. The form factor along with the spiritual values associated with space exploration makes ASIMO an embodiment of techno-animism. In addition, ASIMO can also communicate with humans through language and gestures. Communication is a defining factor of determining whether something is an individual being or not. In Japan, the robot industry offers a wide range of functions from talking robots to sex robots. Conversation and sexual relationships used to be concepts that only belonged to humans. However, technological advancements and techno-animism are breaking down that barrier with engineering designs that embodies human and spiritual characteristics.
Beyond the design of objects, the way that people choose to interact with objects could also demonstrate techno-animism. In Shinjuku, Tokyo, there is a restaurant where the waiters are robots instead of humans. Rather than talking to another person, customers only interact with machines throughout the dining process. In this process, customers accept the fact that technology has become part of the human society and has a unique way of interacting with humans.
Social implications.
Japanese culture and legislation are generally supportive of the techno-animism trend. Considering that Japan's modernization took place in a relatively short period of time in comparison to western nations, techno-animism is seen as a major reason why Japan has been one of the world's centers of technological innovations. As a result, acceptance of techno-animism is the current attitude in Japan both culturally and legislatively.

Rodney Legg

Rodney Frank Legg (18 April 1947 – 22 July 2011) was a campaigner, author and publisher, known for being chairman of the Open Spaces Society and for publishing numerous works on the history and landscape of Dorset, England.
Early life.
Legg was born in Bournemouth on 18 April 1947. His parents, Ted and Gladys, were of Dorset ancestry, and had one older son. Legg attended primary school in Charminster, then Winton Boys School until age 16. As an adolescent he joined the League of Empire Loyalists, in which he participated for seven years, including making flag-waving protests at Conservative and Labour party conferences.
Career.
After leaving school with five O-levels, Legg's first job was for the "Basildon Standard" in Essex, as a reporter. After four years he returned to Dorset and founded "Dorset: The County Magazine" in 1968, which later became "Dorset Life".
Legg led a campaign to restore public access to the army-occupied Lulworth Ranges in south Dorset, including the village of Tyneham that had been evacuated by command of the War Office in 1943 and never returned to its former residents. Known as the Tyneham Action Group, this campaign – founded by Legg in 1967 – eventually resulted in weekend access to ten square miles of land that were also secured from being ploughed or developed.
Having joined the Open Spaces Society at age 16, Legg became treasurer in 1981 and chairman in 1989. He believed that all land should be publicly accessible; he opened Steep Holm island in Somerset to public access, after helping to buy it in 1976 in memory of his friend Kenneth Allsop. Legg was the island's warden for 25 years. In 1990 Legg became the Open Spaces Society's appointee on the council of the National Trust. He was critical of the Trust, calling it "an elitist club for art connoisseurs", and sought to change it from within. His complaint, based on years of experience of finding Trust land blocked to public access, caused debate in the national press.
Legg published 125 books, including a collaborative edition – with author John Fowles – of John Aubrey's "Monumenta Britannica" (1980–1982).
Personal life.
Legg's partner was Di Hooley.
Legg died from cancer on 22 July 2011, age 64.

Virado

Virado, also known as virado à Paulista, is a whole-meal dish from the state of São Paulo, Brazil. It dates to the time of the earliest Portuguese settlers to the region. The dish consists of a platter of beans cooked in sautéed onion, garlic, fat, and salt; dried, toasted manioc flour; a pork chop; fried sausage; breaded and fried plantain; eggs, preferably with the soft yolk; kale, cut into strips and braised in fat; rice; and "torresmo", a crisply cooked pork rind. Virado is traditionally served on Mondays. About 500,000 plates of the dish are served per week in the city of São Paulo.
History.
Virado arose spontaneously during the early colonial period of Brazil as a dish of the bandeirantes. The bandeirantes traveled to the interior of Brazil first to capture and enslave native Brazilians, and later to find gold, silver, and diamonds. They carried beans, pork, and corn flour in their backpacks to the interior of the state. Stored in the backpack, the ingredients "turned" (Portuguese: "virar") and mixed, hence the name of the dish, "virado". Virado in the period of the bandeirantes consisted only of beans, usually cooked without salt so as not to harden, maize flour, dried meat, and bacon. Cassava flour was substituted for corn flour after the introduction of the crop to the São Paulo region in the 18th century. The bandeirantes and other early settlers ate virado cold or warmed.
The earliest written reference to virado is in 1602, when Nicolau Barreto made an expedition to present-day Paraguay, Bolivia, and Peru. It is also associated with the "monção", who led expeditions by river into remote areas of the Brazilian interior from the early 18th to the early 19th century.
The dish became a staple of homes and farmsteads in the São Paulo region. Homes in São Paulo in the early colonial period were severe and lacked the elegance of those in Bahia, Pernambuco, or Rio de Janeiro. Virado was served at all times of the day with little variation; in this period it consisted of beans, bacon, flour, a piece of pork, smoked linguiça, and kale.
Rice was introduced to virado in the 19th century after the wide-scale introduction to the crop in Brazil; it was cooked in the remains of cooked pork or sausage, and additionally flavored with lard, garlic, and salt. Dessert served with virado consisted of fresh fruit such as oranges; bananas fried with cinnamon and sugar were also common.
Dom Pedro I ate virado on August 17, 1822 at Fazenda Pau d'Alho, in São José do Barreiro, Vale do Paraíba on the trip from Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo.
Variations.
There are several variations of virado, either around the basic ensemble of pork, fried banana, beans mashed with cassava flour, rice, kale, and fried egg. The virado can be prepared with black beans and corn flour.
An early variation of the dish emerged when the bandeirantes turned their expeditions to Minas Gerais, where the dish became known as "tutu à mineira". "Tutu à mineira" differs from Virado in its use of ground beans; the version in São Paulo uses whole beans. One variation served in the interior of the state of Santa Catarina substitutes cooked cabbage for kale.

Matthew Washington Kennedy

Matthew Washington Kennedy (10 March 1921 – 5 June 2014) was an American classical pianist, professor, choral director, composer, and arranger of Negro Spirituals. He is widely known as the director of the historic Fisk Jubilee Singers of Nashville, Tennessee from 1957 to 1986.
Early life and education.
Kennedy was born in Americus, Georgia, the fourth child of Royal Clement Kennedy and Mary Magdalene Dowdell. His father was a postal worker, and died of a heart attack when Matthew was 15 months old. Royal Clement's parents had been slaves on the Kennedy Plantation near Andersonville, Georgia. Matthew's mother was born to Joseph and Maria Dowdell in Sumter County, Georgia. She was a public school teacher.
A child prodigy, he picked out the melodies on the piano of hymns and Spirituals he heard sung by his mother, and composed his first piano piece called “The Bells” at age six. Kate Land agreed to give him piano lessons in exchange for having her house cleaned by Matthew and his cousin. The star of his own radio show at age 11, Matthew played the organ to accompany silent films at the segregated cinema where he was given the stage name “Sunshine,” and was dressed in a bellhop uniform. In 1932, Matthew and his mother sat in the segregated balcony for a live concert given by famed Russian pianist Sergei Rachmaninoff in Macon, Georgia.
Frustrated with the segregated South, Mary Kennedy decided to move with her son to New York City. Soon after they arrived, Matthew auditioned at the Juilliard School, and was admitted because of his imitation of Rachmaninoff's playing style. Lois Adler gave him a personal scholarship for study in the Preparatory Division. He simultaneously studied and graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School, and earned a diploma in piano from Juilliard in 1940.
His teacher Lois Adler advised Kennedy to return to the South for his college degree, and arranged for him to study at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee on scholarship. In 1940, Mrs. James A. Myers was director of the Fisk Jubilee Singers at the time, and she asked Kennedy to serve as piano accompanist for the group. From Fisk, Kennedy was drafted to serve in World War II, and was sent to North Africa and Southern France. After returning from the war, he graduated from Fisk University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1947 (cum laude). Kennedy went on to earn his Master of Arts degree from Juilliard in 1950, and completed coursework toward his Ph.D. from George Peabody College in Nashville.
Career.
Employed by Fisk University as an instructor in 1947, Kennedy became a member of its music faculty in 1954 as an associate professor. In 1956, he married pianist Anne Gamble. Kennedy was appointed director of the Fisk Jubilee Singers in 1957, and he mentored hundreds of young students for the next twenty-three years. In 1958, Kennedy made his own solo piano debut at Carnegie Recital Hall. Over the years, Kennedy toured the world as a concert pianist and as director of the Fisk Jubilee Singers. He was appointed acting chairman of the Fisk University Music Department in 1975. He retired from Fisk University in 1986.
Kennedy had served on resource panels for the Tennessee Arts Commission, and on boards of the Nashville Symphony Association and the John W. Work, III Memorial Foundation. He received the Achievement Award from the National Black Music Caucus of the Music Educators’ National Conference, distinguished service awards from the National Association of Negro Musicians, the Fisk University Alumni Association, and Omega Psi Phi fraternity. Kennedy held lifetime memberships with the NAACP and the Fisk University General Alumni Association. He was a member of the Nashville Fine Arts Club where he served as president. He was also a member of the Nashville Symphony Guild, Gamma Phi chapter of Omega Psi Phi, First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill, and an inductee into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in Macon, Georgia. At Fisk he was inducted into Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity.
In 2003, Kennedy released his first album, "Familiar Favorites". In 2006, he received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Fisk University.
In September 2006, The Honorable Jim Cooper, representative of Tennessee, entered a statement honoring Dr. Matthew Kennedy into the Congressional Record, which took place during the Proceedings and Debates of the 109th Congress, Second Session in Washington, DC.
Kennedy continued to play the piano for the congregation at First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill in Nashville after he was into his 90s. He died on June 5, 2014, at the age of 93.
Appearances in film.
In 2007, Kennedy's daughter Nina Kennedy, also a concert pianist, directed and produced a documentary film, "Matthew Kennedy: One Man's Journey", which won the award for Best Film by a Black Filmmaker at the 2007 Nashville Film Festival (NaFF).
He also appears in a short video titled "Matthew Kennedy: The Nashville Student Sit-Ins" (2006), produced by The Visionary Project.

MACS J1149 Lensed Star 1

MACS J1149 Lensed Star 1, also known as Icarus, is a blue supergiant star observed through a gravitational lens. It is the most distant individual star to have been detected so far (as of Aug 2021), at approximately 14 billion light-years from Earth (redshift z=1.49; comoving distance of 14.4 billion light-years; lookback time of 9.34 billion years). Light from the star was emitted 4.8 billion years after the Big Bang. According to co-discoverer Patrick Kelly, the star is at least a hundred times more distant than the next-farthest non-supernova star observed, SDSS J1229+1122, and is the first magnified individual star seen.
History.
In April and May 2016, the star was found in the course of studying the supernova SN Refsdal with the Hubble Space Telescope. Astronomer Patrick Kelly of the University of Minnesota is the lead author of the finding, published in the journal "Nature Astronomy".
While astronomers had been collecting images of this supernova from 2004 onward, they recently discovered a point source that had appeared in their 2013 images, and become much brighter by 2016. They determined that the point source was a solitary star being magnified more than 2,000 times by gravitational lensing. The light from LS1 was magnified not only by the huge total mass of the galaxy cluster MACS J1149+2223—located 5 billion light-years away—but also transiently by another compact object of about three solar masses within the galaxy cluster itself that passed through the line of sight, an effect known as gravitational microlensing. The galaxy cluster magnification is probably a factor of 600, while the microlensing event, which peaked in May 2016, brightened the image by an additional factor of ~4. There was a second peak near the brightness curve maximum, which may indicate the star was binary. The microlensing body may have been a star or a black hole in the cluster. Continuous monitoring of the star "Icarus" may one day rule out the possibility that primordial black holes constitute a sizable fraction of dark matter. Normally, the only astronomical objects that can be detected at this range would be either whole galaxies, quasars, or supernovas, but the light from the star was magnified by the lensing effect. They determined the light was from a stable star, and not a supernova as its temperature did not fluctuate; the temperature also allowed them to catalog the star as a blue supergiant. Because the visible light is the redshifted ultraviolet tail, the star does not appear blue to us but reddish or pink.
The light observed from the star was emitted when the universe was about 30% of its current age of 13.8 billion years. Kelly suggested that similar microlensing discoveries could help them identify the earliest stars in the universe.
Name.
The formal name MACS J1149 is a reference to MAssive Cluster Survey and the star's coordinates in the J2000 astronomical epoch.
While Kelly had wanted to name the star "Warhol", alluding to Andy Warhol's notion of having 15 minutes of fame, the team ended up naming the star "Icarus" based on the Greek mythological figure.
Astrophysical implications.
The discovery shows that astronomers can study the oldest stars in background galaxies of the early universe by combining the strong gravitational lensing effect from galaxy clusters with gravitational microlensing events caused by compact objects in these galaxy clusters. By using these events, astronomers can study and test some models about dark matter in galaxy clusters and observe high energy events (supernovae, variable stars) in young galaxies.

Jennifer "Jen" Kehoe, (born 15 November 1983) is and Author and former professional skier, formerly competing with visually impaired athlete Menna Fitzpatrick as her sighted guide on the IPC World Cup circuit and has represented Great Britain winning four medals including gold at the Pyeongchang 2018 Paralympic Games in South Korea becoming Britains most decorated winter Paralympians. She was a British Army Officer.
As well as competing, she worked with wounded veterans and service personnel to support them in their recovery journey as the Performance Manager of the Armed Forces Para-Snowsport Team. It was through Army racing that Jennifer became a para-alpine ski guide. In 2014, she started her guiding career skiing with Paralympian Millie Knight, although a serious injury prevented Kehoe from competing in the Sochi Paralympics. Now skiing with Menna Fitzpatrick, the pair exceeded expectations at the Winter Paralympics in South Korea. They paired up in September 2015, which is proving to be a hugely successful partnership. Along with over 20 Gold and Silver medals to their names, they made history in 2016 by becoming the first ever British athletes to win an overall World Cup crystal globe and be crowned World Cup champions. Kehoe and Fitzpatrick also won the discipline title for giant slalom that season, as well as placing second in the super-G classification and third in the downhill and slalom standings.
Fitzpatrick and Kehoe took a bronze medal in the giant slalom at the 2017 World Para Alpine Skiing Championships in Tarvisio, despite Fitzpatrick suffering a broken hand in a super-G training accident in October 2016 ahead of the 2016-17 season, keeping her off the snow for two months and requiring her to have surgery. The following season the pair took the discipline World Cup title for super-G.
At the 2019 World Para Alpine Skiing Championships Fitzpatrick and Kehoe took five medals, securing bronze in the giant slalom and silver in the slalom before winning gold in the downhill ahead of compatriots Kelly Gallagher and Gary Smith, becoming the first British skiers to win both Paralympic and World Para titles. They then took a second gold in the super-G before rounding off their championships with a second silver in the combined.
On 25 August 2021, she announced the end of her partnership with Fitzpatrick and said her future was within the British army.
Military service.
Kehoe underwent officer training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. On 12 December 2009, she was commissioned into the Royal Engineers, British Army, as a lieutenant with seniority in that rank from 16 June 2008. She was promoted to captain on 12 June 2012. After attending staff college, she was promoted to major on 31 July 2019.

Anne Lucille Gamble was born in Charleston, West Virginia to Dr. Henry Floyd Gamble and the former Nina Hortense Clinton. She was the younger of two children born to that union. She had two older step-siblings, Katherine Lee Gamble and Henry Floyd Gamble, Jr. Anne was eleven years old when her father was killed in a car accident in 1932. Dr. Gamble's mother had been a slave on the Howard's Neck Plantation in Goochland County, Virginia. His father, Henry Harmon Gamble, was a foreman on the same plantation, and of Scotch-Irish and Native-American descent. Anne's mother was a high school music teacher and a member of Frederick J. Loudin's Jubilee Singers, and witnessed and photographed the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902 while on tour with the group in London.
Kennedy and famed contralto Marian Anderson were dear friends and colleagues. The two met when Anderson stayed in Dr. Gamble's home while in Charleston because, as an African American, she was not allowed to stay in hotels.
She received her early education in Charleston public schools, which were segregated at the time. She later studied in the Junior Department at West Virginia State College under David Carroll and Theodore Phillips. Matriculating at Fisk University in 1937 where she studied with William Duncan Allen and graduated cum laude in 1941 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and joined the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. She then won competitive scholarships at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music while studying with the Conservatory Director, Dr. Frank Shaw, and later with John Elvin, receiving a Bachelor of Music degree. Her further education included study at the Juilliard School of Music, George Peabody College, and artist training with pianist Ray Lev in New York.
Career.
Early in her career, Kennedy had been engaged to appear as piano soloist with the West Virginia Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto. A few months before the concert, the conductor died suddenly. Her contract was canceled by the conductor's replacement due to suspected racist sentiment. She also auditioned for Duke Ellington while he was in Charleston, who invited her to perform in New York.
Kennedy was a performing artist and teacher, and launched a concert career after serving on the piano faculties of HBCUs Tuskegee Institute and Talladega College. Her career was interrupted when she accepted an invitation extended by Professor John Wesley Work III in 1950 to teach piano at Fisk University for one semester. The "one semester" resulted in Kennedy's tenure of thirty-two years. For seventeen of her years at Fisk, she served as accompanist and piano soloist with the Fisk Jubilee Singers under directors John Wesley Work and Matthew Kennedy. In 1956 she married Matthew Kennedy in the Fisk Memorial Chapel. Their wedding was a gift from then Fisk President Charles S. Johnson. Their daughter is pianist, filmmaker, and orchestral conductor Nina Kennedy.
During a Caribbean concert tour in 1955, Anne Gamble Kennedy performed for the heads of state in Kingston, Jamaica; the Virgin Islands; and Port-au-Prince, Haiti, giving a command performance for President and Madame Paul Magloire.
Kennedy and her husband traveled and performed as duo pianists, and were known for their rendition of Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos. She received critical acclaim for her performances of Norman Dello Joio's "A Jubilant Song" and Undine Smith Moore's "Lord We Give Thanks to Thee" with the Fisk Jubilee Singers under Matthew Kennedy at New York's Carnegie Hall and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC. Her final faculty recital at Fisk in 1970 included the Liszt Sonata in B minor, Bach-Tausig's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, Chopin's "Barcarolle", Ravel's "Valses Nobles et Sentimentales", and John W. Work's "Appalachia" Suite. She also received critical acclaim for her performance of Beethoven's Choral Fantasy as piano soloist with the Nashville Symphony and the Fisk University Choir.
In 1954, artist Aaron Douglas selected Anne Gamble for a series of portraits of distinguished Fisk faculty, commissioned by Fisk University.
After her retirement from Fisk, Kennedy was known for her performances of her own arrangement of Albert Malotte's "The Lord's Prayer." She participated in community activities, including The Women's Advisory Committee of the Tennessee Performing Arts Foundation; music consultant for the Fine Arts Committee of the Nashville Chamber of Commerce; member of "The Outing" Committee, Nashville Symphony Benefit; Vice President of the John W. Work, III Memorial Foundation; the Nashville Chapter of Links, Inc.; and a Life Member of the NAACP. A music scholarship at Fisk University has been named in honor of Kennedy and her husband, titled "The Matthew and Anne Gamble Kennedy Scholarship Fund."

Moses &amp; Søn G. Melchior

Moses &amp; Søn G. Melchior was a trading house based in Copenhagen, Denmark. It traded on the Danish West Indies with its own ships from circa 1820 and was also involved in passenger transport.
History.
The company was founded by Moses Marcus Melchior (1736-1817) in 1760. The company was originally based at Amagertorv 11. The company initially specialized in import of tobacco from the Netherlands but began to trade on the Danish West Indies from circa 1790.
Melchior's son Gerson Melchior (1771-1845) continued the company together with his two eldest sons after his father's death in 1817. The company acquired its first ships in circa 1820. They sailed on the Danish West Indies, both with freight and passengers.
A third brother, Moritz Melchior (1816-1884). joined the company in 1840. One of his elder brothers had died in 1834 and the other one died in 1843; he therefore continued the company alone when his father died in 1845 but his younger brothers Moses Melchior (1825-1912) and Israel Melchior (1827-1893) joined the company in 1848 and 1853. An elder brother, Sally Melchior (1814-1865), established a company in Hamburg in a partnership with his later brother-in-law Bernhard Dehn (1808-1863)
Moses &amp; Søn G. Melchior relocated to Højbro Plads 21 in 1855. In 1865, it was a co-founder of the company Det Danske Fiskeriselskab. The company owned the whaler "Thomas Roys".
Moses Melchior and Moritz Melchior's son Carl Henriques Melchior (born 1855) headed the company after Moritz Melchior's death in 1884. It sold its last ship, "Clara", a brig, in 1905.
In 1912, the company relocated to Strandgade 34 in Christianshavn.

Polly Hurry

Polly Hurry (2 May, 1883, Kyneton - 5 August 1963, Frankston), was an Australian painter. She was a founding member of the Australian Tonalist movement and part of the Twenty Melbourne Painters Society.
Early life.
Described in a 2009 review by Sasha Grishin as “a South Australian Meldrumite who has been almost totally forgotten,” Mary 'Polly' Hurry in fact was born in Kyneton, Victoria, on 2 May, 1883, daughter of Henry Hurry and Mary Herring and the middle child of two siblings, Maurice and George. She spent her early years there at the family home "South Lodge", 29 Donnithorne Srreet, then was educated at Ruyton Girls' School, Kew.
Training.
Later, at the Kyneton School of Mines, Hurry took lessons in drawing and wood carving, then studied watercolour painting with the Scottish-born artist, John Mather. During a camping holiday she met several artists, who like Mather were associates of the tonalist Max Meldrum, and decided to take up art seriously. She began drawing from life at Melbourne's 1859 Old Temple Court building where studios were occupied by students of Frederick McCubbin; Jessie Traill, Dora Wilson, Janet Cumbrae-Stewart, Nora Gurdon and AME Bale; before approaching Meldrum to join his studio as one of the first of his pupils, alongside Harry McClelland.
Australian tonalist artist.
Hurry regarded Meldrum as the most important influence on her artistic development, but the association also shaped her personal life; in Meldrum’s studio she met John Farmer whom she married on 13 August 1921. Farmer (1897-1989) was a close friend of fellow student 10 years younger, Justus Jorgensen, when both attended the National Gallery School in 1914, where he also met Clarice Beckett and Colin Colahan. Brought up in a large family in Brunswick, Farmer worked as a scenery painter for J.C. Williamson Ltd. Richard McCullin, a drawing master at the Gallery School, suggested that students might be interested in going to hear a lecture in 1917 by controversial young painter, Max Meldrum, who argued that "the art of painting is a pure science - the science of optical analysis."
Hurry became a founding member of the original Twenty Melbourne Painters Society — Jas Stuart Anderson, Alice Bale, Elsie Barlow, Alexander Colquhoun, George Colville, Edith Downing, Bernice Edwell, William Frater, Mrs H. M. Gulliver, Carl Hampel, C.E. James, Richard McCann, Bertha Merfield, A.E. Newbury, Clara Southern, Ruth Sutherland, Jo Sweatman,  Isobel Tweddle, and Rose A. Walker  — all supporters and students of Meldrum, which split from The Victorian Artists Society in protest at his defeat in the 1918 election for its president. In 1919, the breakaway group held their first exhibition. Twenty Melbourne Painters Society founding Secretary A.M.E. Bale declared:“We desire nothing but sincerity and a humble study of nature, from which alone all art, whether decorative or realistic, draws any enduring life.”
Also in 1921, Hurry entered the inaugural Archibald Prize, in which 41 works were submitted and all exhibited from 17 January 1922 for two months. The Prize was awarded to WB McInnes, but no catalogue for the 1921 exhibition has been found, and the subject of the work submitted by Hurry is not known. 
The couple shared one of the purpose-built studios (Studio 2) at the 1888 Grosvenor Chambers, 9 Collins Street, Melbourne (its name a direct reference to Grosvenor Gallery of London) occupied also at various times by Meldrum, Tom Roberts, Frederick McCubbin, Arthur Streeton, Percival Ball, Charles Francis Summers, Clara Southern, Jane Sutherland, Charles Conder, E. Phillips Fox, John Longstaff, Girolamo Nerli, Louis Abrahams, Rose Walker, George Lambert, and Ola Cohn. Frequent visitors to the studio were Janet Cumbrae-Stewart, Norah Gurdon, Dora L. Wilson (who also had a studio in the building), Jessie Traill, Norah Wilkie and Margaret Pestell.
Asia.
For their honeymoon the Farmers left via Hong Kong for China, visiting Shanghai and Peking, and Japan via Korea, to paint. An oft-repeated perception is that they were among the first few Australian artists to do so, though Ellis Rowan (1848-1922), Tenison Woods and Godfrey Miller preceded them, and Asian art was being collected in Australian museums from 1904. The result is Hurry's "Temple Lantern at Nikko", which handles the challenging geometry of the subject’s forms, and its spatial relations with two Japanese maple trunks that embrace it, with planes confidently rendered, following Meldrum's principles, in incremental, limited steps of earth and grey tones, against an abstracted background of soft-focus greens. 
Not long after their return to Australia, they moved to Olinda, quite close to Jorgensen’s brother, Elef, who was the doctor in Belgrave, and were close neighbours of Arthur Streeton. Justus Jorgenson designed Farmer's house, named "Miyako", to include a very large open room, not dissimilar to the Elef Jorgensen’s’ Big Room' and thus served as an artists' retreat for many of the Meldrum students. Clarice Beckett was staying when Hurry and Farmer conducted a formal Japanese tea ceremony and also practised the ancient art of ikebana, inspiring Beckett’s painting of a vase of gladioli, a rare and large example of Beckett working in the still life genre.
European residency and return to Australia.
In late 1923, inviting Meldrum and his family to stay in their house, Hurry and her husband set out for Europe, arriving first of all in Paris, where they were reunited with the Jorgensons and the Colquhouns. She painted two copies after Velasquez (whose technique Meldrum emulated) in the Louvre over February to May 1924. They divided their time in Europe between France; first in a studio in Montparnasse preparing works accepted into the Salon d'Automne and the winter salon; and lodgings in St John's Wood near Regent's Park in London, where Hurry had some success with two portraits being exhibited at the Royal Society of Portrait Painters. They made a pilgrimage to Millet’s studio at Fontaineblau, following his footsteps in the forest and painting around Barbizon, and travelled south to the French Riviera and painted at the coastal city of Nice. Time was also spent in Holland to see Rembrandt works.
Returning to Australia in 1926, Hurry showed 57 works jointly with Farmer whose taste for Old Masters was reinforced by his encounters with Modernism in Europe, and, after her election to the Melbourne Society of Woman Painters and Sculptors she exhibited with them from 1927 to 1962. Also with Farmer in 1927 she showed “thumbnail sketches” in Margaret MacLean's studio gallery, 450 Collins Street with Elsie Barlow, Jessie Traill, Nora Gurdon, Rosa A. Walker, Hilda Travers; artists identified by a reviewer as all “well-known.”
The couple returned to Paris and London 1932-35 and she found success at the French Salon in Paris in 1933, and still while away in 1934 showed her works alongside Meldrum, Clarice Beckett,  Alma Figuerola, Justus Jorgenson and Percy Leason at the Athenaeum Gallery in Melbourne. 
Contemporaneous commentary on her career frequently attaches her to her husband. One 1939 "Age" article identifies her as “Miss Polly Hurry,” while in the same year another in "The Argus" notes that “Mrs. John Farmer (P. Hurry) has a cottage at Olinda as well as a studio in the city but despite her country setting she paints mostly portraits;” referring to the Grosvenor Chambers which she occupied until 1959, and where during WW2 she showed in a short charity exhibition 6-11 May 1941. She also made it available to the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors as their volunteer headquarters in which they made and sold handcrafts, fashion and art to raise money for the war effort and learned and practised first aid drills, as documented by Sybil Craig’s gouache in the National Gallery of Australia.
Reception.
Hurry concentrated on portraiture and still life, and earlier in her career painted some landscapes, all of which attracted commentary and criticism. 
As early as 1916 reviewers of Victorian Artists' Society shows praised her "graceful touch [which] reveals a sympathetic observer in Nature's storehouse," and noted that; "The continued success of Miss Hurry is gratifying, as noted in two delicate examples, "Emu Bay" and "Back Road to Woodend" both touching a high level." In 1920 "The Argus," writing of her contribution to the Twenty Melbourne Painters' second exhibition, declared that "Miss P. Hurry shows a portrait of Miss Marie Ney, which is one of the most striking things on view."
On the couple's return from Europe in 1926, "The Argus" reported that;"Mrs Farmer shows landscapes, portraits, and still life, and she also has copied from the old masters, in her case Velasquez, and she hangs a study of the "Infanta Marguerite" by that painter. Mrs Farmer's portraits, while bold in the handling of the planes, fail somewhat in the colour, and the flesh tones are often unnaturally yellow. This is strongly in evidence in "Minnie", a portrait exhibited at the Royal Society of Portrait Painters. Her best portrait is to be observed in the portrait "The Polish Girl." Among the still life paintings a well handled study of "Hydrangeas" calls for specially favourable comment. Of the landscapes, "Side Street, Amersham", "Snow on the Seine", "Sea Mist on the Cornish Coast", "Cochrane St St John's Wood", and "Summer in the Park" are excellent examples, and reveal a sincere seeking after truth of atmospheric effect."
Her near-life-size portrait "Miss Joyce Wingate" of 1929, which is (since 1987) in the collection of the V&amp;A, was in an October 1929 show at the Athenaeum of The Twenty Melbourne Painters, then numbering 27 as remarked by "The Bulletin" reviewer who describes “P. Hurry (Mrs. Farmer)” having caught her subject “in a yellow dress and an arresting posture, and painted them with vim.” 
However her neighbour in Olinda Arthur Streeton, then in his sixties while art critic for "The Argus" from 1929 to 1935, continually expressed discontent with Hurry's quality of finish, which was coloured by his prejudices about the Meldrumite perceptual art method, with negative remarks about her work in the Twenty Melbourne Painters show of September 1932. Of a Melbourne Society of Women Painters exhibition in October that year, he comments that;"The central position is occupied bv No. 63, "Madame", a large canvas by P. Hurry who seems to be content with a first large "lay-in" of the subject. With continued sittings the work could he improved in relative light and dark or tonal values."Hurry's portrait "Miss Joyce Wingate" reappeared in a 1934 exhibition of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and a reviewer marks it “an example of special interest”…”the full length standing figure of a girl in yellow dress, by Polly Hurry, in which a graceful motive and a harmonious color scheme work together for good. The success of this picture just misses assurance through the imperfect treatment of the face, which is not carried sufficiently far to balance the handling of the dress and other accessories.” In 1937, Harold Herbert in reviewing a brief June exhibition at the Athenaeum by the couple with sculptor John W. Elischer."P. Hurry (Mrs. John Farmer), in very sincere impressions, is able to convey colour light, and tone convincingly in portraits and portrait groups. Smudgy edges, involving lack of valuable accentuation of textures, rob her pictures of complete effectiveness. Delicate appreciation of such things were thoroughly practised by the painters of years ago. These matters are treated with scant consideration by artists to-day. Mrs. Farmer is a follower of the Meldrum School, so is Mr John Farmer, who shows in this home exhibition. "Portrait of An Old Lady" is a good example of her powers in the art of portraiture and also "The Lady in White". The latter, a virile, poster-like sketch, carries splendidly, viewed from across the gallery. It lacks refinement technically. Perhaps she is not interested in this side of her art."
Herbert seems to temper this opinion in his review shortly thereafter of the 28th annual exhibition of the Society of Women Painters in noting how Hurry in "two studies in the Meldrum manner demonstrates again her undoubted ability." 
One of Hurry's more celebrated subjects, in a portrait held in the Castlemaine Art Museum, is the German-Jewish scholar Ursula Hoff, who migrated to Melbourne in 1939 as the first individual with professional qualifications in art history and curatorship to be employed in an art gallery or museum in Australia, working at the National Gallery of Victoria for thirty years. 
A "Bulletin" reviewer of a show of “Meldrum’s disciples” a year later, regards Hurry’s work as of similar stuff to her teacher’s other older students. Though still exhibiting with the Twenty in 1959, four years before her death, in Arnold Shore’s review her profile is still bound to Farmer’s;“Still-life studies by John Farmer and Polly Hurry are equally distinguished by unclamant virtues.”In a review of "Misty Moderns: Australian Tonalists 1915-1950", curated by Tracey Lock-Weir in 2008, critic John McDonald singles out Farmer, Hurry and Colquhoun as artists for;“impressive work in this show - work that goes beyond the simple data of close observation and touches the viewer's imagination. Oddly enough, Meldrum often appears less accomplished than his students. This may be because he lacked that quality whose existence he always denied: talent. It may be because he applied his methods in more rigorous fashion.”
Death.
For health reasons Hurry moved from Olinda to Frankston in 1954, where she died 5 August, 1963, at 80 years old, survived by Farmer, who was 14 years her junior, and her brother Maurice, a solicitor in Kyneton. She was cremated at Fawkner Crematorium and Memorial Park on 7 August.
Legacy.
Hurry was a foundation member of the Twenty Melbourne Painters, exhibited with them from 1919 to 1963 and was made a life member in 1961. She exhibited with the Victorian Artists' Society from 1961 until the late 1930s, and with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors from 1927 to 1962. 
In 1978 a street in the Canberra suburb of Chisholm was named Hurry Place in her honour.
In 2009 Hurry was included in the retrospective exhibition "Misty moderns: Australian Tonalists 1915–1950".

William R. Jordan III

Bill Jordan (born 1944), more formally William R. Jordan III, is an American botanist and journalist who has played a leading role in the development and critique of ecological restoration as a means of developing an environmentalism that is philosophically more coherent, psychologically more productive, politically more robust, and ecologically more effective. His critique has had a significant influence on environmentalism in the United States and abroad.
Jordan worked for 24 years at the University of Wisconsin's Arboretum in Madison. This was the site of early attempts to recreate historic ecological communities, such as tallgrass prairies and maple forests, an effort led by the famed conservationist Aldo Leopold. In 1981 Jordan founded and served as editor of the journal "Restoration &amp; Management Notes" (now "Ecological Restoration"), and he was a founding member of the Society of Ecological Restoration.
He has been called the first person to write consistently about the interplay between humans and nature within the context of ecological restoration, the most influential writer on restoration, and a world leader in the field.
Early life and education.
Jordan was born in Denver. His mother was an English teacher and his father a forester who advised clients on land-management projects, including various forms of environmental rehabilitation.
He earned a B.S. in biology from Marquette University in 1966, a PhD in botany from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1971, and an MA in journalism in 1975, also from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
He lives in Madison, Wisconsin.
Career.
In 1981, working at the University of Wisconsin arboretum, Jordan founded and edited the journal "Restoration &amp; Management Notes" (now "Ecological Restoration"), recognized as the first journal to deal exclusively with the subject of restoration ecology.
In 1984 he organized a symposium to undertake the first systematic exploration of the value of restoration as a technique for basic ecological research. He was senior editor of the resulting book, "Restoration Ecology: A Synthetic Approach to Ecological Research".
He was a founding member of the Society of Ecological Restoration (1989) and served as SER’s supervisor of administration for its first five years (1989-1993).
Since 2001 Jordan has been director of the New Academy for Nature and Culture and editor of its online journal "Environmental Prospect."
Philosophy.
Jordan’s critique of environmental thinking stems from his reflections on the pioneering ecological restoration project initiated by Aldo Leopold and a handful of colleagues at the UW-Madison Arboretum in the mid-1930s, and on Leopold’s reflections on land management in "The Land Ethic," the concluding essay in his book "A Sand County Almanac". Jordan saw this project, with its commitment to restoration of historic ecosytems, as an early contribution to the development of a form of land management that offers a way for people to achieve what Leopold had called "membership in the land community."
However, drawing on the work of literary critic and poet Frederick Turner, Jordan developed a critical perspective on Leopold's idea of community, which Jordan feels is limited by its exclusion of negative emotions, specifically shame.
Jordan defines shame, which he distinguishes from guilt, as the emotional response to the self’s awareness of its dependence on others, including animals and plants—in having, for example, to kill and eat them to survive. This shame, he argues, is “not the response of conscience to what we do, but of consciousness of what we are."
Our shameful feelings, as Jordan understands them, are not a condemnation of human existence but rather the raw material for the creation of the values that make human life worthwhile. Frederick Turner argues that ritual and the fine arts (which Jordan terms the “technologies of the imagination”) provide the tools humans need to deal productively with this aspect of experience.
In Jordan's recasting, ritual and the arts offer a way to foster values such as community and beauty that Leopold made the foundation of his land ethic. Jordan argues that they have played this role throughout human history, sometimes citing anthropologist E.N. Anderson, who wrote that "All traditional societies that have succeeded in managing resources well over time, have done it in part through religious or ritual representation of resource management."
Jordan argues that the lack of such shared rituals, typical of modern societies, is the crucial factor limiting progress toward realization of a sound ethic of relationship between humans and the rest of nature.
Considering ecological restoration from this perspective, Jordan proposes its development as a modern version of the "world renewal" rituals characteristic of many traditional societies. Acknowledging the difficulty, uncertainty, and ultimately even the impossibility of restoration, he sees these qualities as essential to the value of restoration as an encounter with human limitations, and so with shame and the experience of transcendent values.
Examples of restoration, not yet fully ritualized, but clearly being developed as spectacle or performing art include: the conversion of tree girdling to a work of art by Wisconsin artist Barbara Westfall; nighttime prairie burns to which the public are invited in northern Illinois; and classes in reflective restoration offered at Eckerd College in Florida.

Afropolonia

Afropolonia is a genus of chigger in the family Trombiculidae, subfamily Apoloniinae, and tribe Apoloniini. , it is monospecific, just consisting of its type species A. tgifi. It is found in South Africa. Its type host is the Namaqua rock rat. M. Lee Goff circumscribed "Afropolonia" and described "A. tgifi" in 1983.
Diagnosis and description.
In keys to Apoloniinae species written by Goff in 1983, by Goff and colleagues in 1989, and by Wayne A. Brown in 2006, "Afropolonia tgifi" was paired with "Apolonia tigipioensis", the sole species of its genus. All three of these keys noted "Afropolonia" could be distinguished from "Apolonia" in having five branched setae on the palpal tarsus and in lacking subterminala I.
Russian acarologist Alexandr A. Stekolnikov's 2018 key to African Trombiculidae paired "Afropolonia" with a pair including "Straelensia" and "Vargatula". His key distinguished "Afropolonia" from those two genera in having both an anterior and a posterior pair of sternal setae, in having branched galealae, and having a coxal setation formula of 1-1-1.
The idiosoma, or body, of the "A. tgifi" larva measures . Its anterior eyes are 11 μm in diameter while its posterior eyes have a diameter of 6 μm.
Phylogeny.
"Afropolonia" is in the subfamily Apoloniinae. Goff placed "Afropolonia" in the tribe Apoloniini due to the sensillae having an "unexpanded" shape. Goff also included the genera "Apolonia", "Straelensia", "Vargatula", and "Womersia" in Apoloniini, following P. H. Vercammen-Grandjean and M. Kolebinova's 1968 circumscription of the tribe. A fifth genus, "Liuella" was later added to this tribe.
Distribution.
"Afropolonia" is found in South Africa. The type locality for "A. tgifi" is Studers Pass.
Biology.
The type host is the Namaqua rock rat. , this is the only known host.
Taxonomic history.
The American entomologist M. Lee Goff circumscribed the genus "Afropolonia" in 1983. Goff designated "A. tgifi", which he described in the same work, as the genus's type species. This was the sole species included in the genus. Goff's description was based on two specimens collected in 1980. The holotype was deposited in the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences; the paratype was deposited in the National Museum of Natural History.
The specific epithet of the type species comes from the acronym "TGIF" ("Thank God It's Friday"). Goff had initially planned to describe this species in the "Journal of Medical Entomology", although they rejected his paper because of this name; at the time, the ICZN Code discouraged "comical" names. Goff has surmised that the "Bulletin of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences" subsequently accepted his paper because the European editors were unfamiliar with this term.

Innova (video game company)

Innova Intellectual Properties S.à r.l. is a Russian video game publisher and localization company headquartered in Luxembourg. Games published by the company in Russia include "Blade &amp; Soul", "Aion", "Ragnarok Online", "Crowfall", "Point Blank", "RF Online"
History.
Innova was founded in 2006 by George Chumburidze (a representative of the Italian yacht shipyard Azimut-Benetti), Armen Gasparyan, Vasily Medvedev, Oleg Sambikin, and Gevork Sarkisyan. In 2009, Sambikin and Medvedev exited the business and founded the developer Syncopate. At the time of the company's creation, the online games market in Russia was described as a "gray zone": foreign games were mainly adapted by pirates. The first licensed game released by the company was "RF Online" by the South Korean company CCR.
In 2010, Innova released a launcher compatible with all games released by the company. In January 2012, this was replaced by the 4game platform. In December 2010, the company launched the online movie theater Ayyo, which provided video-on-demand and download-to-own paid access to films. In the following years, Ayyo showed both profit and loss, and in March 2017, it was frozen in the midst of the general unprofitability of the Russian online cinema market.
Investments.
In late 2013, Innova bought the exclusive rights to develop KidZania, a Mexican network of game training parks, in Russia, the United States, Canada, and France. The rights were previously held by a subsidiary of the Kuwaiti company M.H. Alshaya Co.. Investments in the project, made by Innova shareholders and partner companies, amounted to $2530 million. In January 2016, the first Russian KidZania opened in the shopping center Aviapark on the Khodynka field in Moscow. At the end of 2016, the investment advisory firm Winter Capital Partners, associated with Russian businessman Vladimir Potanin, acquired 21.5% of Luxembourg's Innova Partners, the operator of KidZania edutainment parks. Investments were aimed at supporting international expansion: the company plans to open parks in 2018-2019 in Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, and Paris in 2018-2019.
Also in late 2013, Innova became a co-owner of the Russian digital distribution system for legal video content Pladform, founded by Armen Gulyan. Georgy Chumburidze invited as a co-investor in the project. Innova played a role of the project’s financial investor with a smaller control package, with Armen Gulinyan, the founder of Pladform, remaining responsible for the management. In 2016, Pladform merged with the Russian video hosting Rutube, as a result of which 33.3% of the merged company Ruform transferred to Gazprom-Media holding, and the remaining shares were divided between Pladform co-owners.
The Swedish video game holding company Enad Global 7 wholly acquired Innova in February 2021 with shares worth .

Brent Wadden

Brent Wadden (born 1979, Nova Scotia, Canada) is a painter whose practice centers on fiber, specifically wool and yarn. His work has been compared to that of Sheila Hicks, Anni Albers, and Clyfford Still.
Life and work.
Wadden completed his B.F.A. at Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in 2003, where he studied under the late conceptualist painter Gerald Ferguson.
Known for making abstract geometric weavings with unpredictable graphic lines that reject any predetermined systems, he hopes that they "create some amount of confusion in the viewer which would lead to a fascination with the process." Originally focusing his practice on colorful, tessellated paintings and drawings, in 2010, Wadden began working on a weaving loom. Influenced by the quilts of Gee's Bend, the artist has explained that he avoids thinking "about the boundaries and limitations of what art is or isn't," and often sources his materials, pre-used or second-hand, from Craigslist, eBay, and Kijiji. Imperfect angles, intentionally mismatched panels, varying fibers, and pilled fabric all point to the hand rather than machine labor in the works—he expands on this, commenting: "My work is about patterning, and rhythm, and always making a mistake at some point throughout it." This DIY aesthetic is also reflected in the fact that Wadden has never had formal training with textiles or on the loom. His woven paintings also draw on the histories of Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, First Nation and Bauhaus textiles, folk art, and indigenous traditions of art-making (particularly those of his native Nova Scotia), as well as reference current political issues, such as his "Keystone XL rag rug".
The artist's first solo museum exhibition took place in 2018 at Contemporary Art Gallery, Vancouver. His work has also been exhibited at Columbus College of Art and Design, the Rubell Family Collection, Saatchi Gallery, Peres Projects, and the Art Gallery of Alberta, Canada.

Pladform

Pladform is a Russian digital distribution system for licensed video content. It has been a part of the unified company “Ruform” since 2016, which also includes video hosting Rutube.
Company.
The development of the system began in 2012 within the framework of the company “Pladform”. It was founded by Armen Gulinyan — in the past he was a co-founder of “Pirogov's Bureau” and an employee of the media holding “”, which became the first investor of the new company. In July–August 2013, the company established a partnership with the reseller of “Gazprom-Media Digital” and launched a closed beta testing of the platform. Attempts to attract additional investment from companies of advertising market weren't unsuccessful, so the company was growing from main activities revenues.
In late 2013 the company was invested by the Russian localizer and publisher of online games Innova, and its founder Georgy Chumburidze invited another investor, , to the “Pladform”. According to Gulinyan, at the beginning of 2015 the total investment in the project amounted to about 20 million rubles, and none of the company's co-owners held a controlling ownership interest, so the company's management remained in the hands of the CEO.
In 2015 “Yellow, Black and White” withdrew their capital from “Pladform”. In 2016 it became known about the merger of “Pladform” and the managing company of Russian video hosting Rutube, owned by “Gazprom-Media Holding”. In the merged company “Ruform” the holding got 33.3%, and 66.6% were divided between the owners of “Pladform”. Gulinyan was appointed the general director of the merged company. As a result of the merger, “Gazprom-Media Holding” got access to the content distribution network, and “Pladform” — to the licensed content of the channels included in the structure of “Gazprom-Media”. B2B solutions for rights holders and promotional tools continued to operate under the “Pladform” brand, and B2C platform kept the name Rutube. After the merger, Rutube increased its share of views in Runet from 15% to 40% and made it to the top of the app rankings in Google Play and AppStore.
Model of work.
Pladform acts as an intermediary between rights holders, advertisers and websites, providing storage of video on their own servers and broadcasting via their own media player with video advertising support. Right holders can upload their own content onto websites, which are connected to “Pladform”, and search for any content which was previously uploaded violating the copyright. From legal point of view such videos are being “cleared”. “Pladform” profits from promotional materials included in the video: 75% of the revenue from the advertising goes to the content owner, 25% is shared between the platform and the website that embeds the media player.
In 2015 “Pladform” had 5.95 billion views. By the beginning of 2016, “Pladform” worked with 130 Russian and foreign copyright holders, including “Yellow, Black and White”, “Alexander Maslyakov and Company” (AMiK), “”, “”, “Krasny Kvadrat” and . The company's player was installed on almost 2.5 thousand websites, including video hosting sites, news and entertainment sites and social networks, including VKontakte, Odnoklassniki and My World@Mail.Ru (they provided about 40% of the views). It is also built into mobile applications and works in Smart TV systems. In the “Pladform” library there are about 1 million units of licensed content. In the summer of 2017 VKontakte opened a content exchange market focused on administrators of public pages of the social network and working on the basis of the combined catalog of “Pladform” and Rutube.
According to Digital Video IAB Russia, as of September 2017, “Pladform” was the second-largest player in the Russian online video market, second only to YouTube (21.5 million and 26.8 million people, respectively).

Disney+

Disney+ (pronounced Disney Plus) is an American subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service owned and operated by the Media and Entertainment Distribution division of The Walt Disney Company. The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by The Walt Disney Studios and Walt Disney Television, with dedicated content hubs for brands such as Disney, Pixar, Marvel, "Star Wars", National Geographic, and including Star in some countries. Original films and television series are also distributed on Disney+.
Disney+ relies on technology developed by Disney Streaming Services, which was originally established as BAMTech in 2015 when it was spun off from MLB Advanced Media (MLBAM). Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017, and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI as part of a corporate restructuring in anticipation of Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox. With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018, and Disney's streaming distribution deal with Netflix ending in 2019, Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content. Production of films and television shows for exclusive release on the platform began in late 2017.
Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, and expanded to Australia, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico a week later. It became available in select European countries in March 2020 and in India in April through Star India's Hotstar streaming service, which was rebranded as Disney+ Hotstar. Additional European countries received the service in September 2020, with the service expanding to Latin America in November 2020. Upon launch, it was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. Alterations made to films and television shows also attracted media attention. Ten million users had subscribed to Disney+ by the end of its first day of operation. The service has 116 million global subscribers as of July 2021.
History.
In late 2015, Disney launched a streaming service in the United Kingdom called DisneyLife to test the streaming market. It was eventually replaced by Disney+ on March 24, 2020.
In August 2016, Disney acquired a minority stake in BAMTech (a spin-off of MLB Advanced Media's streaming technology business) for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future. Following the purchase, ESPN announced plans for an "exploratory [over-the-top] project" based on its technology (ESPN+) to supplant its existing linear television services. On August 8, 2017, Disney invoked its option to acquire a controlling stake in BAMTech for $1.58 billion, increasing its stake to 75%. Alongside the acquisition, the company also announced plans for a second, Disney-branded direct-to-consumer service drawing from its entertainment content, which would launch after the company ends its existing distribution agreement with Netflix in 2019. Not long after, Agnes Chu, story and franchise development executive at Walt Disney Imagineering, was the first executive appointed for the unit, as senior vice president of content. Chu led two projects to launch the new unit. First, Disney needed to verify exactly what content could be physically and legally made available through a streaming service right away, which meant physically reviewing all content in Disney's vaults that had not recently undergone restoration, and reviewing "binders of pieces of paper with legal deals" to identify potential obstacles. Second, Chu met with leaders of Disney's various content-producing divisions to start brainstorming which projects would be appropriate for release on a streaming service rather than in movie theaters. Chu later left in August 2020.
In December 2017, Disney announced its intent to acquire key entertainment assets from 21st Century Fox. Intended to bolster Disney's content portfolio for its streaming products, the acquisition was completed on March 20, 2019.
In January 2018, it was reported that former Apple and Samsung executive Kevin Swint had been appointed as the senior vice president and general manager reporting to BAMTech CEO Michael Paull, who leads development. In March 2018, Disney's top level segment division was reorganized with the formation of Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International, which then included BAMTech, which contains "all consumer-facing tech and products". In June of the same year, longtime Disney studio marketing chief, Ricky Strauss, was named president of content and marketing, however reporting to chairman of Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International Kevin Mayer. In January 2019, Fox Television Group COO Joe Earley was named executive vice president of marketing and operations. In June 2019, Matt Brodlie was named as senior vice president of international content development. In August 2019, Luke Bradley-Jones was hired as senior vice president of direct to consumer and general manager of Disney+ for Europe and Africa.
On November 8, 2018, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that the service would be named Disney+ and that the company was targeting a launch in late 2019. A September launch was reportedly planned, but on April 11, 2019, Disney announced that Disney+ would launch on November 12, 2019 in the United States. Disney stated that it planned to roll the service out worldwide over the next two years, targeting Western Europe and Asia-Pacific countries by late 2019 and early 2020, and Eastern Europe and Latin America during 2020. The timing of international launches is subject to the acquisition or expiration of existing streaming rights deals for Disney content. On August 6, 2019, Iger announced that it will offer a streaming bundle of Disney+, ESPN+, and the ad-supported version of Hulu for $12.99 per month available at launch. At the D23 Expo in August 2019, Disney opened subscriptions to Disney+ at a discounted rate for three years.
On September 12, 2019, a trial version of Disney+ became available in the Netherlands with limited content available. This testing phase lasted until the official launch on November 12, when trial users were switched to a paid plan. Disney+ became available for pre-order in September in the United States with a 7-day free trial upon launch.
In October 2019, Disney released a three-and-a-half-hour trailer on YouTube to showcase their launch lineup. It was also reported that Disney would ban advertisements for competitor Netflix from most of its TV platforms, except ESPN.
Disney+ launched on November 12, 2019 Midnight Pacific Time in the announced initial three launch countries. The services had some issues the first day from logging in (about 33% of the problems), accessing specific content (about 66%), setting up profiles and watch lists. Some of the issues were due to third party devices.
On November 18, 2019, an investigation by ZDNet discovered that thousands of users' accounts were hacked using keystroke logging or info-stealing malware. Their email addresses and passwords were changed, "effectively taking over the account and locking the previous owner out", and their login information was put up for sale on the dark web.
On March 12, 2020, Vanessa Morrison, who previously served as President of Fox Family and 20th Century Animation, was appointed President of Streaming for Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production and will oversee development and production of Disney+ film content from The Walt Disney Studios for both Disney Live Action and 20th Century Studios. Morrison reports directly to President of Walt Disney Pictures Sean Bailey.
On October 12, 2020, Disney announced a reorganization of their media business with a greater focus on streaming. They are planning to add more content for Disney+ and their other streaming platforms (such as Hulu) in the future.
On December 10, 2020, Disney announced that a year after the launch of Disney+, it had over 86.8 million subscribers. It was later announced that as of January 2, 2021, the platform had over 94.9 million subscribers. In January of the same year, Ricky Strauss, who led Disney Plus’ content curation and marketing efforts, exited the Walt Disney Company.
In March 2021, Disney announced an increase to the streaming service's pricing that would take place on March 26, 2021. In the second quarter of 2021, Disney+ added 8.7 million subscribers.
In August 2021, Disney CEO Bob Chapek hinted that a possible Hulu Disney+ merger could happen in the future to create an all-in-one streaming service on Disney+. He mentioned that Disney might ditch its streaming bundle of Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ eventually. This is similar to the Star brand on Disney+ available in overseas markets outside of the United States.
Content.
The service is built around content from Disney's main entertainment studios and film and television library, including Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Disneynature, Disneytoon Studios, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, National Geographic, and select films from 20th Century Studios, Searchlight Pictures, Touchstone Pictures, and Hollywood Pictures. The service will operate alongside Hulu, which Disney gained a controlling stake in following the 21st Century Fox purchase. Bob Iger stated that at launch Disney+ would be focused specifically on family-oriented entertainment (and not carry any R and NC-17 or TV-MA-rated content), and that Hulu would remain oriented towards general entertainment. Hulu will also host Disney+ as an add-on service.
Content library.
It is suggested that Disney+ has approximately 7,000 television episodes and 500 films, including original television series and films from Disney Channel and Freeform, and select titles from 20th Television and ABC Signature. New releases from 20th Century Studios (including Blue Sky's "Spies in Disguise") will not immediately be available on either Disney+ or Hulu, as the studio has pre-existing output deals with other premium TV/streaming providers (including HBO in the U.S. until 2022, Crave in Canada and Sky in the UK, Ireland, Italy and Germany). "Captain Marvel", "Dumbo" (2019), and "" became the first theatrically released Disney films to stream exclusively on Disney+ within the pay-cable window.
It was announced that Disney+ would add the first 30 seasons of "The Simpsons" to the service at launch, as the series' new exclusive home, with season 31 being added on October 2, 2020 in the United States.
Iger said that Disney+ will eventually host the entire Disney film library, including films currently in the "Disney Vault". However, he stated that the controversial "Song of the South" (1946), which has never been released on home video in its entirety in the U.S., will not be released on the service. Walt Disney Animation Studios' 1946 film "Make Mine Music" is not available on the service, possibly due to a gunfight scene, making it the only film in Disney animated canon not to be included. Despite being available at launch, at least five films"Home Alone", ', ', "Ice Age" and ""were removed from the service in the U.S.
It was initially unclear whether the first six films of the "Star Wars" franchise would be available in the United States at the service's launch, as TBS held streaming rights through 2024 as part of its cable rights to the franchise, but in April 2019, it was announced that the films would be available at launch along with "The Force Awakens" and "Rogue One", with "The Last Jedi" added on December 26, 2019; "The Rise of Skywalker" added on May 4, 2020, and "" was added on July 10, 2020. On April 2, 2021, several older "Star Wars" were released.
In the United States, most of the films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe were available at launch, with the exception of seven films: ' (added on December 5, 2019), "Black Panther" (added on March 4, 2020), ' (added on June 25, 2020), and "Ant-Man and the Wasp" (added on August 14, 2020), due to existing licensing deals with Netflix; and "The Incredible Hulk", ', and ', which are unavailable because their distribution rights are owned by Universal Pictures ("The Incredible Hulk") and Sony Pictures (Spider-Man).
Some films were modified by Disney: a post-credits scene from "Toy Story 2" was edited out; nudity was eliminated from "Splash" by adding digital hair, blurring, and cropping certain scenes; films such as "Adventures in Babysitting", "Free Solo", and "Hamilton" are altered to remove profanities; "The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin" (1967) was edited to remove racial slurs, and the short film "Santa's Workshop" (1932) was edited to remove a "stereotypical black doll". Some older content, such as films, animated shorts, and series, have a content disclaimer on the platform noting the possibility of outdated cultural depictions. Starting in October 2020, a 12-second content disclaimer informing viewers of racially insensitive scenes plays before some older Disney filmsincluding "Peter Pan", "Dumbo", "Swiss Family Robinson", "Lady and the Tramp", "The Jungle Book", "Aladdin" (alongside the two direct-to-video sequels), and "The Aristocats". Additionally, by January 2021, some of these films were no longer viewable on kids profiles; the titles were still available to view on regular profiles. "", which contains both nudity and the word "fuck", began airing uncensored in mid-2020. Some series are missing episodes, including "Darkwing Duck", "The Little Mermaid", "The Proud Family", "Phineas and Ferb", "Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends", "The Muppet Show","" and "The Simpsons", amongst other programs. All episodes featuring Stoney Westmoreland on "Andi Mack" are banned from the service.
Original scripted content.
The service's initial original content goal was planned to include four to five original films and five television shows with budgets from $25–100 million. In January 2019, it was reported that Disney would spend up to $500 million in original content for the service. Original series based on "Star Wars" and Marvel properties have been or are being produced. Original "Star Wars" series include "The Mandalorian", a seventh season of the animated ' (and a spin-off series titled '), "Obi-Wan Kenobi", "Andor", "Lando", "The Acolyte", as well as three series spun off from "The Mandalorian": "The Book of Boba Fett", "Rangers of the New Republic", and "Ahsoka". Original Marvel series include "WandaVision", "The Falcon and the Winter Soldier", "Loki", an animated "What If" series, "Ms. Marvel", "Hawkeye", "Moon Knight", and "She-Hulk".
In January 2019, Disney+ ordered "Diary of a Future President" from CBS Television Studios, its first series from an outside production company.
A television series remake of the film "High Fidelity" was initially announced for Disney+, but in April 2019, it was announced that the project had been moved to Hulu, citing concerns from its staff that the positioning of Disney+ as a family-friendly service was at odds with their creative vision for the series. "Love, Victor", a spin-off of the film "Love, Simon", was similarly shifted from Disney+ to Hulu in February 2020.
In August 2019, Iger announced that 20th Century Fox films such as "Home Alone", "Night at the Museum", "Diary of a Wimpy Kid", and "Cheaper by the Dozen" will be "'reimagined' for 'a new generation'" exclusively for Disney+ by Fox Family.
Original episodic content will be released weekly, opposed to all at once with the release time to be 12:01 a.m. PT on Fridays, starting November 15, 2019 until June 25, 2021 for original series and on Wednesdays starting June 9, 2021 for new original series and new seasons of the respective series.
On December 25, 2020, "Soul" became the first feature-length film from Pixar to be released as a Disney+ original. The next Pixar film, "Luca", was also released as a Disney+ original.
In September 2021, it was reported that Disney will begin a new television release strategy by giving episodes from certain series an early premiere on Disney+ ahead of their television debuts. The first series to be released througth this strategy will be "The Ghost and Molly McGee", with episodes 3 to 5 being released on Disney+ on October 6, 2021.
Original unscripted content.
Disney also plans original factual television content for the service, aiming to "find the ethos of Disney in everyday stories, inspiring hope and sparking the curiosity of audiences of all ages." Some of these series will have ties to Disney properties, including behind-the-scenes documentary miniseries focusing on Disney studios (such as one following the production of "Frozen II"), the Disney-themed competition cooking competition "Be Our Chef", "Cinema Relics" (a documentary series showcasing iconic costume and props from Disney films), "Marvel's Hero Project" (a series showcasing "inspiring kids [that] have dedicated their lives to selfless acts of bravery and kindness"), and "The Imagineering Story" (a Leslie Iwerks-directed documentary series chronicling the history and work of Walt Disney Imagineering). National Geographic also produced "Magic of the Animal Kingdom" (a docuseries following the animal caretakers of Disney's Animal Kingdom and Epcot's aquarium) and "The World According to Jeff Goldblum".
Disney reached a two-year pact with the documentary studio Supper Club (Brian McGinn, David Gelb and Jason Sterman, producers of Netflix's "Chef's Table") to produce content for the service, including the conservation-themed nature documentary series "Earthkeepers", and "Marvel's 616", a documentary series chronicling the cultural and societal impact of Marvel's characters. Other factual series include "Encore!" (a Kristen Bell-produced series that reunites casts from high school musical productions to reprise their roles), "(Re)Connect" (a reality series produced by Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos' Milojo Productions), "Rogue Trip" (a travel series featuring Bob Woodruff and his son Mack), and the reality competition "Shop Class".
Premier Access.
The live-action adaptation of "Mulan" was premiered in select countries on Disney+ with Premier Access for a premium fee ($29.99) on September 4, 2020, and later was made available for free to all subscribers on December 4. A second feature film, "Raya and the Last Dragon", was offered through the Premier Access model on March 5, 2021, the same day as its theatrical release, and was made available for all users on June 4. In March 2021, Disney announced that "Cruella" and "Black Widow" would both release theatrically and through Premier Access. In May 2021, Disney announced that "Jungle Cruise" would also be released theatrically and through Premier Access.
Third-party content.
Disney+ has some select TV series that are not owned, produced and/or distributed neither by Disney nor its subsidiaries, like "" (from Zagtoon) and "PJ Masks" (from Hasbro's Entertainment One, who owns the rights of the "Power Rangers" franchise which Disney owned from 2001 to 2010).
In April 2021, Disney and Sony Pictures reached a multi-year deal to bring Sony's films in the United States to Disney's streaming services. As part of the deal, titles from Sony's library as well as future theatrical releases would become available on Disney's streaming services and linear networks following their first pay window begins in 2023.
Device support and service features.
Disney+ is available for streaming via web browsers on PC and Mac, as well as apps on iOS and Apple TV, Android and Android TV, Fire TV and Fire HD, Chromecast and Chromebook devices, Samsung Smart TVs, LG webOS TVs, Vizio SmartCast TVs, Roku devices, Xfinity Flex, Sky Q, Now TV devices, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows 10. Content available on Disney+ is also listed in the Apple TV and Google TV apps.
Accessibility features include closed captioning, audio description (also known as described video), and audio navigation assistance.
Disney+ allows seven user profiles per account, with the ability to stream on four devices concurrently and unlimited downloads for offline viewing. Content is able to be streamed in resolutions up to 4K Ultra HD in Dolby Vision and HDR10, with Dolby Atmos sound on supported devices. Legacy content and Disney+ originals are available in multiple languages. Subtitles and dubbing are available in up to 16 languages. A substantial amount of content is available in Hindi, Indonesian, Thai, Malay, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Malayalam, Kannada, and Marathi languages on the Indian and select Southeast Asian countries counterpart, Disney+ Hotstar.
In late May 2020, the service added the ability to switch between 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios for early "Simpsons" episodes, after the service received backlash for stretching those episodes to 16:9 by default at launch. Disney had done this "in order to guarantee visual quality and consistency across all 30 seasons." To accommodate the feature, Disney Streaming Services "had to reconfigure its content-delivery engine" while ensuring the new feature would not break any existing features such as continue watching, watchlists, and auto-playing, as they did not want to treat the 4:3 versions as bonus content. The resulting changes allowed Disney to apply the existing audio, subtitle information, episode artwork, and other metadata from the episodes to both aspect ratios regardless of which is chosen by the user. Joe Rice, vice president of media product at Disney Streaming Services, added that these adjustments "opens up a number of exciting opportunities for novel ways of presenting content in the future."
In September 2020, the service added the GroupWatch feature which allows up to seven different Disney+ accounts to link up and co-view programming with one another. Viewers are able to react to content with six different emojis, and control playback for the entire group. It is available on web browser, mobile app, smart TVs, and connected TV devices in the United States, and will expand to Europe later in 2020. The feature was previously tested in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.
Launch.
Disney+ was launched early in the Netherlands on September 12, 2019, as a free trial. It officially launched in the Netherlands, United States and Canada on November 12, 2019, just before 3:00 a.m. EST (). Disney+ launched in Australia, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico on November 19, 2019, and launched in Austria, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland on March 24, 2020. In the UK and Ireland, Disney+ replaced DisneyLife. In Spain, a linear Disney+ television channel launched alongside the streaming service. The channel is available exclusively on Movistar+, which serves as Disney+'s launch partner in the region.
In December 2019, it was announced that Canal+ would be the exclusive distributor of Disney+ in France. The launch in France was delayed from March 24 to April 7, pursuant to a request from the French government to conserve network capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic placing additional strain on communications networks.
In February 2020, Iger announced that it planned to launch Disney+ in India on March 29, 2020, by means of its existing service Hotstar, rebranding its paid tiers as a co-branded service. Hotstar was acquired by Disney during the Fox purchase, and has been the dominant streaming service in the country. However, it was postponed due to the Indian Premier League being rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was then launched on April 3, 2020.
In April 2020, it was announced that Disney+ original content would be licensed to pay TV and streaming operator OSN, starting on April 9, in 17 countries in the Middle East and North Africa region with Disney noting that they had no current "plan to launch Disney+ as a standalone service in the region in the near future". On August 12, Disney announced that it will launch in the Middle East and Africa in Summer 2022.
The service launched in Japan on June 11, 2020, as part of Disney's existing partnership with NTT Docomo, and succeeded the existing service in the region.
Disney+ launched in Indonesia through Hotstar on September 5, 2020; Portugal, Belgium, Finland, Iceland, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Greenland on September 15, 2020; and in Latin America and the Caribbean on November 17, 2020.
The service expanded to Singapore on February 23, 2021. It was announced that the service would also expand to Central and Eastern Europe, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Israel, South Africa, and Turkey later in between 2021 and 2022. Among them, it has been confirmed that the service will launch on November 12, 2021 in South Korea and Taiwan, and on November 16, 2021 in Hong Kong.
Star, Disney+'s brand for general entertainment content, would launch on February 23, 2021, in Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore and is expected to be rolled out to select international markets in the near future, including Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Israel and South Africa. Star will add to Disney+ in Japan on October 27, 2021, and will launch along with the service in South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in November 2021.
On February 25, 2021, it was reported that Disney+ would launch in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand through Hotstar within 2021. It was later confirmed that the launch would take place in Malaysia on June 1, 2021, and Thailand on June 30, 2021. 
Reception.
On November 13, 2019, a day after its launch, Disney announced that the streaming service had already signed up more than 10 million subscribers. Disney+ has been well-received, thanks to its affordable price and for the extensive Disney library. Frank Pallotta of CNN stated that "the company [Disney] has repackaged its trove of beloved content for the service makes it a worthy companion to the other services in the marketplace. Nick Pino of "TechRadar" stated, "If Disney keeps it updated with new content, Disney+ could rival Netflix sooner rather than later."
Upon launch, Disney+ experienced significant technical difficulties. Users complained about receiving error messages that the service was down and that they were "unable to connect", which were irritating because many of them had paid for the service months in advance. In some instances, passwords needed to be reset to enable access.
One other negative aspect with the launch of the service was the presentation of the non-HD episodes of "The Simpsons". Namely, that instead of presenting them in their original aspect ratio, they were either cropped to fit widescreen televisions or awkwardly stretched out to that aspect ratio. FXX's now-defunct "Simpsons World" streaming service was similarly criticized when it launched. In response, Disney stated they would make the ability to watch the episodes of the first 19 seasons and some from season 20 in either the 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio in early 2020. The feature was made available on May 28, 2020.
Some have noted that episodes of "The Simpsons", "X-Men", "DuckTales", "Phineas and Ferb", "Kim Possible", and "" are presented almost entirely out of order, while some series are missing episodes. Others have questioned why an extensive catalog of Disney-owned material is missing from the platform, including older Disney-produced films, Disney Junior titles, Marvel content, some Muppets media, and the unreleased "Star Wars" animated comedy series "Star Wars Detours". On June 26, 2020, the 2017 "DuckTales" series had its episodes arranged in the proper order while co-creator of "Phineas and Ferb", Jeff "Swampy" Marsh, has stated that they are working on correcting the order of his series.
Disney+ was the top trending Google search term in 2019 in the US. In February 2020, Disney reported that Disney+ had 26.5 million subscribers by the end of 2019, and 28.6 million by February 3, 2020. By April 2020, Disney+ had 50 million paid subscribers, with approximately 8 million of those coming from India. The service had 54.5 million subscribers by May 4, 57.5 million subscribers by the end of June, 60.5 million subscribers by August 4, 73.7 million subscribers by September 30, and 86.8 million subscribers as of December 2. In February 2021, Disney reported that Disney+ had 94.9 million subscribers as of January 2, 2021. On March 9, 2021, Disney reported that the service had surpassed 100 million paid subscribers but did not say when it had hit the milestone. The company clarified that it would now only be providing subscriber number updates when certain milestones are reached, as opposed to releasing exact numbers each quarter.
In 2020, Apple Inc. named Disney+ the Apple TV App of the Year. It was the second and third most-downloaded free app of the year globally on the iPad and iPhone, respectively. It was also voted the best app of 2020 by Google Play users.

Ted J. Land

Theodore Joseph Land (August 22, 1936 – March 31, 2018) was an American businessman and politician.
Biography.
Early years.
Ted J. Land was born on August 22, 1936 in Miami, Florida. The Lands subsequently moved to Columbus, Georgia around 1950, where they had strong family ties. Ted served two years in the Navy after High School graduation. He then attended the University of Georgia, where he graduated fifth in his class in 1962. Following college graduation, Land worked as a marketing executive at Royal Crown Cola for over 10 years. While he owned a variety of businesses over the years, he eventually concentrated on real estate sales. Known as a hard worker and someone who loved making deals, he sold over 100 homes.
Political career.
Senator Land served six terms (12 years) in the Georgia General Assembly and two and a half years in his local City Council. From 1979 until 1991, Land served as a Republican member of the Georgia State Senate representing Marion, Talbot, and portions of Muscogee counties. He sat on the Appropriations, Insurance, and Transportation committees, and served as Vice-Chairman of the powerful Rules committee.
In his first election to the Georgia Senate, Land's name did not appear on the ballot. He won, nonetheless, as a write-in candidate, a difficult and "unusual" way to get elected. In subsequent elections, Senator Land's name appeared on the ballot as the official Republican candidate for the seat. In the mid-1990s, after his time in the Legislature, Land served on the Columbus City Council.
Personal life.
Land was born into a family which wielded a considerable amount of political influence, in and about Columbus. His uncle, John Henry Land was elected to one term in the Georgia State Senate from 1949 to 1950 before serving as a Superior Court Judge for twenty-four years. Other uncles and cousins served on Columbus City Council. Another cousin, Clay D. Land, who also served on the Columbus City Council, was elected to the Georgia State Senate in 1994, and served three terms representing the same district previously held by Ted Land. In 2001, Clay Land was appointed to the position of United States District Court Judge, by President Bush.

Aleksandër Moisiu

Alexander Moissi (; ; 2 April 1879 – 22/23 March 1935) was an Austrian stage actor of Albanian origin.
Early years.
Moissi was born in Trieste to Moisi Moisiu from Kavalye, Ottoman Empire (today Kavajë in Albania), who was a rich Albanian merchant of oil and wheat, and an Arbëresh mother, Amalia de Rada, from Trieste, daughter of a Florentine doctor. 
After an international childhood in Trieste, Durrës and Graz, the 20-year-old Alexander settled with his mother and two sisters in Vienna. He began vocal studies and applied for a drama training at the "k.k. Hofburgtheater", but was rejected due to his strong Italian accent and had to confine himself to non-speaking roles. It was his performance in Molière's "Tartuffe" of the "Burgtheater" 1899/1900 season, which stunned the renowned Austrian actor Josef Kainz, playing the lead role. 
With Kainz' encouragement and support, Moissi's career as one of the great European stage actors of the early-20th century began. The following year took him to the New German Theatre in Prague and in 1903 he joined the ensemble of the "Deutsches Theater" in Berlin, where he became a protégé of the influential director Max Reinhardt.
Together with Rudolph Schildkraut he performed in Reinhardt's staging of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice", now emphasizing his melodious speech, which despite first damning reviews finally made him a star. Moissi and the Reinhardt ensemble toured the Russia in 1911 and was acclaimed in Saint Petersburg by critic and dramatist Anatoly Lunacharsky for his interpretation of Sophocles' "Oedipus". Traveling across Europe and the Americas, his most famous role was Fedya in Tolstoy's "The Living Corpse" — performed more than 1400 times by him. In 1914, Moisiu acquired German citizenship to become a volunteer in World War I, and during the German Revolution of 1918–19 joined the Marxist Spartacus League.
In 1920 he played the leading part in the first performance of Hugo von Hofmannsthal's "Jedermann" adaption of "The Somonyng of Everyman" at the Salzburg Festival. However, Moissi did not keep up with the German Expressionist and epic theatre movement initiated by directors like Erwin Piscator and Bertolt Brecht. He finally left Germany after the Nazi "Machtergreifung" in 1933 and was offered Albanian citizenship by King Zog.
Alexander Moissi died of pneumonia on 22 or 23 March 1935, most likely in Vienna (other sources claim 23 March 1935 in Lugano). He was cremated at Feuerhalle Simmering and his ashes are buried at the Morcote cemetery overlooking Lake Lugano in Switzerland.
Work.
In Berlin, Moissi was acclaimed for his 1906 performance of Oswald in Ibsen's "Ghosts" and in the premiere of Wedekind's "Spring Awakening". His interpretations in the leading roles of Hamlet, Œdipus, Faust, and many others, were celebrated at the time, as were his voice and emotional range. Beside the "Deutsches Theater", he performed at the Vienna "Volkstheater" and the "Theater in der Josefstadt". Though primarily a stage actor, he appeared in ten film productions from 1910 to 1935, of which seven were silent, most notably in "The Student of Prague" (1913).
Although a Christian, Moissi was often labeled as Jewish or of at least partial Jewish descent due to his name (which translates to "Moses") and his friendly relationship with fellow Jewish actors at a time when anti-semitism was on the rise. ("Moisiu" is a common Albanian name and rarely indicates Jewish ancestry.) Moissi strongly rebuked his critics in the German press challenging the Christian world to live up to its ideals and desist from persecuting the Jews noting that: ""Where Jews are concerned Christian morality, humaneness, and values are trampled underfoot" and "The road of anti-semitism is a throwback to the dark days of the Middle Ages.""
Legacy.
Streets are named after Alexander Moissi in Berlin, Salzburg and Vienna, where also a monument was unveiled in 2005. In Albania he is highly venerated as a most important national actor. In his honour, the drama school of the Academy of Music and Arts in Tirana as well as the university and the city theatre of Durrës were named "Aleksandër Moisiu".
In his father's hometown of Kavajë, the main public high-school and the local theater are also named after him. The 60th anniversary of his death was remembered in Albania in 1995 with an "Artistic Year" dedicated to him; it was sponsored by the Aleksandër Moisiu Foundation. 
Personal life.
Moissi was married twice:

Stone settings (Exmoor)

Stone settings are a type of monument found in Exmoor, an area of heathland in south-western England. They consist of upright stones that are assembled together either in geometric patterns or seemingly random configurations.
Stone settings are the most common stone monuments to be found on Exmoor. As of 2001, there were 57 that had been conclusively identified. It is likely that the original number had been much higher, with many stones having been removed for use in walling, drainage, and gate posts or to allow a field to be used more easily for cultivation. Some of the solitary standing stones found on Exmoor may once have been part of these stone settings.
The archaeologist Aubrey Burl noted that they were "almost without parallel in Britain and Ireland". Ten of the known stone settings are rectangular in shape. Four are quincunxes, containing five stones each. The majority of the stone settings are not of a recognisable shape, either because they were originally designed in this manner or because they have been altered over time through the removal of different stones.

Jeremy Novy

Jeremy Novy is a California based street and stencil artist best known for his stencils of koi fish and efforts in support of gay activism.
His work has been featured in numerous publications, including SF Weekly, the Wisconsin Gazette and Missionlocal.org. In 2008, Novy was the recipient of the prestigious National Endowment for the Arts grant.
Early History.
Novy earned an associate degree in graphic design from Gateway Technical College in Elkhorn, Wisconsin in 2004. In 2008, he earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts in photography from University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, Wisconsin then relocated to San Francisco that same year.
Street Art.
Novy first became attracted to putting stencils and wheatpastes on the streets to make his art accessible to every viewer, not just the wealthy, well educated patron of expensive galleries. In addition to democratizing art, Novy's mission is to create work that beautifies the city but also work that explores social and political themes.
Koi Fish.
In 2006, Novy spent time traveling through China studying ancient and contemporary art. From his background in graphic design, Novy understood how effective subliminal branding could be and seeing those subliminal messages in political posters throughout China sparked his activism. These posters supported a communist agenda that told people how to think, giving Novy the idea to create street art to encourage viewers to think differently. At the same time he found these communist posters, Novy also learned more about Chinese scrolls, specifically the hidden messages and iconography within the image of the koi fish. The koi symbolize several lessons and trials people often encounter in life and, as koi are able to swim against the current and travel upstream, represent resilience. Furthermore, the number of koi communicates a unique message that corresponds to the meaning of that lucky number in Chinese lore. Novy was inspired by the image and symbolism behind the fish and began stenciling images of it on sidewalks in 2006.
Queer Art.
Novy is one of the few street artists in the United States who openly identifies as being gay. Through his stencils, specifically ones of drag queens, queer CareBears and shirtless men, he is able to make important political and social commentary regarding LGBT rights. Novy generates gay imagery in response to what he says is a predominately male and heterosexual street art community and to promote awareness and acceptance of art regardless of the sexual orientation of its creator. Novy combats this homophobic lack of representation by celebrating gay iconography, ultimately encouraging tolerance and investment in community and urban spaces.
National Endowment for the Arts.
In 2008, Novy received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. With the funds, he curated an exhibition, “A History of Queer Street Art,” which premiered in San Francisco and later toured to Pop Up Gallery in Los Angeles and Yale University.

Nina Gamble Kennedy

Nina Gamble Kennedy (born 1960) is an American classical pianist, orchestral conductor, filmmaker, and writer.
Early life.
Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Kennedy received her first musical instruction from her parents. She is the daughter of Matthew Washington Kennedy, concert pianist and director of the Fisk Jubilee Singers from 1957 to 1986; and Anne Gamble Kennedy, also a concert pianist and piano accompanist for the Fisk Jubilee Singers. Both of her parents served as members of the piano faculty at Fisk University.
She was enrolled in formal piano classes at the Blair Academy of Music in 1968, first with William Higgs, and later with Enid Katahn who would be her primary piano teacher until 1978. A child prodigy, she was presented in her first complete piano recital at nine years old. In 1974 she was engaged by conductor Thor Johnson to appear as piano soloist with the Nashville Symphony in a performance of George Gershwin’s "Rhapsody in Blue" in Nashville's Centennial Park. She received a standing ovation from an audience of over 4,000.
Kennedy graduated from McGavock High School in 1978. That year she was one of three piano students out of a field of 72 pianists who auditioned, accepted for study at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she studied with Eleanor Sokoloff. At the time, famed African-American pianist Natalie Hinderas was on the piano faculty at Temple University. Kennedy began to study with her in 1979, and graduated with a Bachelor of Music degree from Temple in 1982 "cum laude".
From 1979 to 1982, Kennedy served on the piano faculty at the Settlement Music School in Philadelphia. She also taught several private piano students, and continued to teach privately after her arrival in New York.
After her graduation from Temple, Kennedy was accepted for study in the Master's Program at the Juilliard School in New York City, where she majored in piano performance and orchestral conducting. Her second year at Juilliard she was awarded the prestigious William Petschek Scholarship. While at Juilliard she studied with William Masselos and Herbert Stessin. Throughout her studies, Kennedy had performed and participated in master classes conducted by André Watts, Gaby Casadesus, Leon Fleisher, and Leonard Bernstein at Juilliard. She completed the coursework toward the Doctor of Musical Arts degree at the Manhattan School of Music where she studied with Constance Keene. In 1988 she was the winner of the National Endowment of the Arts Solo Recitalist Fellowship.
Career.
On April 5, 1987, the John Wesley Work III Memorial Foundation presented Kennedy in her New York debut recital in Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, for which she received several standing ovations and was called back for encores. John Rockwell of "The New York Times" reviewed the concert.
After Kennedy's New York debut, she embarked on her second European tour which included concerts in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Brussels, and Amsterdam at the Concertgebouw, for which she received several standing ovations and was reviewed by famed music critic Jan van Voorthuysen for "Het Vaderland". Kennedy's television and radio broadcasts include a recital for the BBC in London, performances of the Beethoven Second Piano Concerto with the Jackson (Mississippi) Symphony for WNET (1976), and the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto with the Chautauqua Festival Orchestra recorded live for broadcast on National Public Radio (1981). During her first European tour, she was invited by United States Ambassador to France Joe Rodgers to appear in recital at the American Embassy in Paris. She has appeared as guest soloist in the opening night concert for the Jeunesse Musicalisches Festival at Vienna's Musikverein, and as piano soloist with the Chicago Sinfonietta under conductor Paul Freeman at the Konzerthaus in Vienna. In 1995 Kennedy was invited by United States Ambassador to the Czech Republic Jenonne R. Walker to appear in recital at the American Embassy in Prague. In 1996, Kennedy appeared as piano soloist with the Memphis Symphony Orchestra before a live audience of over 7,000, and a television audience of thousands more, in a concert which was part of the Memphis in May International Festival. The Olympic Torch came through the stadium during the concert on its way to the Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia, and Vice President Al Gore was present to receive the torch and light the Olympic cauldron.
In Europe, Kennedy performed and resided in Vienna (1997–2001), Cologne (2001–2003), and Paris (2003–2007). She served as conducting apprentice with the New York Philharmonic from 1992 to 1995, and L’Orchestre National de France from 2003 to 2007, under Maestro Kurt Masur.
On April 5, 2017, Kennedy celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of her New York Debut by presenting a mini-recital at Steinway Hall in New York City.
Kennedy is the subject of a mini-documentary titled "Portrait: An American Concert Pianist", produced for broadcast on PBS. In 2006, she directed and produced a feature-length documentary film about her father titled "Matthew Kennedy: One Man's Journey", which won the prize for Best Film by a Black Filmmaker at the 2007 Nashville Film Festival (NaFF). Since 2016, Kennedy and her partner April Gibson have been hosting an Artists’ Salon in New York City.

Jim Steg

Jim Steg (1922–2001) was an artist, printmaker, and professor based in New Orleans, Louisiana. Considered the most influential printmaker to be based in New Orleans in the twentieth century, Steg made an substantial impact on printmaking in New Orleans through his own work and over his 43-year tenure as a professor of printmaking at Newcomb College. Over the course of a long artistic career that saw him engage with several 20th century art movements, Steg used nearly every known printmaking technique and invented some of his own.
Early life.
Born in Alexandria, Virginia but raised on a farm in Upstate New York, James Louis Steg lived a quiet childhood between the two World Wars. He showed both a keen interest and a natural talent in drawing from an early age, and dreamed of becoming a cartoonist. While still in high school, he traveled to Chicago to attend a workshop at the Art Institute, where he would receive his first formal artistic training and sketch his first live figure at age 16.
WWII Ghost Army.
When WWII broke out, Steg enlisted in the United States Army, where his artistic training was put to use in a tactical unit known as the Ghost Army. The Ghost Army was made up of 1000 soldiers with artistic backgrounds, including such future titans as Abstract Expressionist Ellsworth Kelly and fashion designer Bill Blass, who were tasked with using their skills to deceive the enemy. Steg and the other members of the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops created and deployed fake inflatable tanks to fool the Germans into thinking Allied troops were nearby, impersonated radio operators to send false intel over the airwaves, and committed several other forms of creative espionage. Jim Steg's experience as a member of the Ghost Army would make an enormous impact on both his life and his art.
The Ghost Army unit proved to be a fruitful creative environment. Steg, along with his comrades Bill Blass and Jack Masey, organized temporary exhibitions of their wartime art; one was staged in the attic of a deserted church. During this time, Steg created his first mature body of work, a series of graphite and watercolor portraits of civilians, soldiers, and refugees that he called "spontaneous impressions." These works are given a haunting quality with context, as many of the Russian refugee subjects portrayed (who often signed their own names next to Steg's) would not survive their return to Russia.
Early work and career: 1945–1960.
After the war, Steg arrived in New York City, where he was given his first solo show at the Weyhe Gallery exhibiting the portraits he had made in combat. In a contemporary interview about the exhibition, Steg described his subjects as "the people of Europe ... The little men of the streets ... The people who suffered the most during the war." At Weyhe Gallery, which was and still is focused on American fine art prints, Steg's interest in printmaking was piqued. Soon after his exhibition, he enrolled in the University of Iowa's newly established MFA program in printmaking. There, under the tutelage of noted Argentine-American printmaker Mauricio Lasansky, Steg began to incorporate more abstract and cubist influences into his work, which had previously been exclusively figurative.
Steg's early prints of the late 1940s were mainly engravings, and etchings. He then began to experiment with woodblock printing and etching in the early 1950s. In 1951, Steg accepted a position as professor of printmaking at Newcomb College at Tulane University, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1992. He continued to push the boundaries of his art during his tenure at Newcomb College, experimenting with the serigraph process, collagraphy, lithography, and toner drawings, among others.
Innovations and accolades: 1960–1975.
Beginning in the early 1960s, Steg was represented by the famed New York City gallery Associated American Artists, resulting in Steg's first New York Times feature in 1963. Steg's printmaking reached its apex in the mid-1960s, "when he introduced photographic images into his intaglio plates." This innovation to combine photoresist etchings with the intaglio process put Steg on the forefront of American printmaking, alongside contemporaries like Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol. Steg was "one of the first artists to begin using photoresist etching in a collage-like fashion and to combine it with other printmaking processes." Steg's work in this new process was shown alongside the work of 18 other artists in the 1968 exhibition "Photography in Printmaking" at Associated American Artists, and was compared favorably to Warhol's silkscreen paintings of Jacqueline Kennedy in a contemporary New York Times review.
In the early 1970s, Steg began to explore the human figure in a new way by "[using] his own body as an implement, often rolling his face across a prepared plate to create a flattened, stretched representation whose ultimate appearance was dictated somewhat by chance." This new technique blended the abstract with the figurative, producing striking prints such as those from his "Seven Attributes" series of 1972. These prints succeeded in developing "his own visual language" and "establishing [Steg] as a unique voice in the field."
Late-career successes: 1975–1995.
While Steg's work received favorable coverage in New York City and abroad, he was primarily recognized as a teacher, rather than as a fine artist, in his adopted home of New Orleans. Residing in New Orleans rather than New York City, the center of the contemporary art world, prevented Steg from doing the necessary self-promotion required to reach a large audience; Steg remarked cynically on this fact in a 1967 interview with the Tulane newspaper: "an artist can become rich through high pressure promotion. This doesn't make for good art, but for successful artists." In a 1974 interview, Steg decried both the conservative New Orleans art market and Newcomb College's long history of decorative art, rather than fine art, as reasons his national and international reputation flourished while his local renown lagged behind. The author, longtime New Orleans art critic Joslyn Fosberg, conferred: "Jim Steg makes prints. They are known the world over ... But he is hardly known here." This trend was corrected in 1978 with "Thirty Years of J.L. Steg: 1948–1978," Steg's first solo retrospective at the New Orleans Museum of Art, which secured Steg's place in the pantheon of twentieth century New Orleans artists, alongside painters George Dunbar and Ida Kohlmeyer and photographer Clarence John Laughlin.
Death and posthumous exhibitions.
Jim Steg died in 2001 at the age of 79. His obituary was written by Daniel Piersol, then Curator of Prints and Drawings at the New Orleans Museum of Art, who remembered him as "one of America's most distinguished printmakers." In the years since his death, Steg's archive has been meticulously maintained by his widow, Frances Swigart Steg. The Jim Steg Collection, managed by Swigart Steg, numbers over 1,000 works and includes "collagraphs, charcoal drawings, serigraphs, woodcut prints, sculptures, ink toner drawings, photoresist etchings, aquatints, color etchings, and paintings"
In 2017, the New Orleans Museum of Art debuted "Jim Steg: New Work," the first solo museum retrospective of Steg's work since his previous NOMA show in 1978. Staged in the museum's Templeman Galleries and numbering over 40 works spanning the length of the artist's career, "Jim Steg: New Work" highlighted Steg's contribution to twentieth century printmaking both in New Orleans and beyond.

History.
1970s.
Limerick F.C. organised a women's team during the 1970s.

Limerick were among its twelve founder members. Like Limerick, other founder members included several teams associated with clubs in the men's League of Ireland. These included Finn Harps, Cork Celtic, Dundalk and Sligo Rovers. Limerick finished the 1973 season as champions after going unbeaten in a fifteen match series. In a post season friendly they lost 3–1 to a touring Stade de Rheims at Markets Field. Limerick have also been credited as the inaugural winners of the FAI Women's Cup. Although the RSSSF archives only list finals from 1989, a match programme from a 1978 international between the Republic of Ireland and France confirmed that the FAI Women's Cup was first played for in 1975 with Limerick defeating C.S.O. (Dublin) 2–1 in the final.

Birdie Alexander

Birdie Alexander (March 24, 1870 – August 2, 1960) was an American educator and music teacher. She was a charter member of the Music Supervisors' National Conference. Alexander is credited with laying the foundations of music education in the Dallas public schools.
Biography.
Alexander was born on March 24, 1870, in Lincoln County, Tennessee. Later, she and her family moved to Texas and she attended school in Forney, Texas and also at Mary Nash College. She returned to Tennessee to study piano and voice at Ward Seminary, graduating in 1891. When she graduated, she and her family moved to Dallas. Alexander became the Dallas Public School's music supervisor and worked there for twelve years during which she established a "first rate system of music education." She organized special concerts for students with conductor Walter Fried. Alexander was a charter member of the Music Supervisors' National Conference, founded in 1907. When officials cut back on music programs, Alexander created her own music textbook, published in 1912, called "Songs We Like to Sing". Alexander was also instrumental in bringing a victrola to play music for her students. She was also invited to lecture on music education at the University of Texas.
Alexander moved to El Paso for health reasons in 1913 after contracting tuberculosis. Her brother-in-law, Robert B. Homan, Sr., was a physician and ran a sanatorium in El Paso called Homan's San. Alexander stayed at the sanatorium for four years where she worked in the office and didn't feel that she would be able to go back to teaching music. Eventually, Alexander began to give piano lessons for her niece and word began to spread and soon Alexander had many students. There were times when she had more students than she could teach and in those situations, she would refer them to other teachers.
Alexander was made an honorary life member of the National Music Teachers' Association of Texas in 1941. Formerly, she had served as president of the organization. In addition, she put together the music department for the Texas State Teachers Association.
Death and legacy.

A self-taught guitarist, Morrison began playing in local bands at age 15 and later performed in clubs as a solo folk singer. While still in college, he came to the attention of noted producer and record executive John Hammond who signed him to record several singles for Columbia Records. One of those singles, released in 1965, was "The Shadow of Your Smile (Love Theme from "The Sandpiper")"; and Morrison was the first singer to record it; however, Morrison's version was eclipsed by subsequent recordings by Tony Bennett and other established artists that made it a hit. Morrison moved to Hollywood in 1967 and worked as a contract actor for Screen Gems and released an album on Capitol Records, entitled "Friends of Mine", which included his original songs. He had a few successes, but after seven years, he gave up his quest for a motion picture career and left Los Angeles.
Career.
In 1973 Morrison moved to Nashville with some aspiration to be a recording artist; he released an album "Home Again" (Monument/MG7618) in the pop-rock genre without much success. He got a job as staff writer for Bob Beckham at Nashville's Combine Music and was paired up to write with Johnny MacRae, whom he considered a mentor; In 1977, Morrison told the "Tennessean", "Nashville was kind of the final stand for me... I knew I didn't want to be an engineer, and for a while I thought I wanted to become an actor. But I saw quickly that your body is a very expendable commodity, while songs that you write last forever." His first hit as a songwriter was "The River's Too Wide", recorded by Olivia Newton-John and Sammy Davis Jr. Some of his other early hits were "Angels, Roses and Rain" (Dickey Lee), "You Lift Me Up to Heaven" (Reba McEntire) and "You're the One" (Oak Ridge Boys). The ABC Television Network used the latter song "You're the One" as the slogan for the network's national promotion in 1978, adapting it to say "We're the One!". To do this, ABC re-recorded the song with different lyrics after they struck an agreement with Morrison. Morrison says he always has five or ten songs in the works; if one isn't coming along, he rotates to the next one.
Morrison's Grammy-winning song "You Decorated My Life" began as a poem written by Debbie Hupp, a Kentucky mother of five who began writing songs while working in a liquor distillery as a nightwatchman. Hupp and Morrison developed a writing relationship. She brought Morrison the first verse and the title, "You Decorated My Life". Morrison supplied the direction for the second verse, and wrote the chorus melody; together they finished the lyric. Morrison suggested the song to Dottie West, who declined it, but suggested it for Kenny Rogers. Rogers' recording, released in 1979, became a No. 1 hit on the "Billboard" Country Singles chart, and No. 2 on the Adult Contemporary chart.
Morrison's song "Lookin' for Love" was one of the few huge hits that originated from unsolicited amateur songwriters. Two Gulfport, Mississippi school teachers, Patti Ryan and Wanda Mallette, had songwriting aspirations. When they saw Morrison on television accepting an award for his song "You Decorated My Life" , they realized Mallette's older brother had gone to school with him, so they sent some of their songs to Morrison; he rejected them. After a while, they sent some more songs that showed some improvement and among them was "Lookin' for Love". Morrison revised a couple of lyric lines that didn’t work, cut the bridge in half and changed the chorus melody of the song slightly. Despite the song initially being turned down more than 20 times, Morrison gave a cassette to a friend in Hollywood who dropped it off at Paramount Pictures. It was chosen by Irving Azoff for the film "Urban Cowboy" and was sung on the soundtrack by Johnny Lee. It rose to No. 1 on the country charts and No. 5 on the pop charts in 1980.
Other noted songs by Morrison are Gary Morris' "The Love She Found in Me", Conway Twitty's "Don't Call Him a Cowboy", and Highway 101's "Whiskey, If You Were a Woman". On the craft of songwriting, Morrison stated "Inspiration is fine, but very undependable. It's a very demanding life, and even when you're successful, you're not sure you want it."
Awards and honors.
Over 350 songs written or co-written by Morrison have been recorded. A partial list is found here: . Morrison was ASCAP's "Country Songwriter of the Year" in 1978, 1980, 1981 and 1982 His songs have been recorded by artists including The Carpenters, Bobby Vinton, Highway 101, Barbara Mandrell, Jerry Lee Lewis and Bobby Goldsboro. Morrison was awarded "Songwriter of the Year"(1980) by the Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI) and, as of 2018, has earned 43 ASCAP songwriting citations. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2016. On the subject of composing songs, Morrison said the inherent constant rejection is hard to overcome. "The enjoyment comes in seeing the results. If you can make people feel something — even if it's rage — then you've done something," he told a reporter.
Personal life.
Morrison is tall, standing about 6 ft 3in. According to the "Tennessean" in 1977, he "has the appearance of a well-kept college athlete". He is one of Nashville's celebrity tennis players and practices often. Morrison said, "To me, these songs of mine are like little children going out into the world...some may be great, and others might fall flat— you just never know".

Crawling at Night

Crawling at Night is a 2001 novel by Nani Power. It follows the lives, over two nights, of Ito, a sushi chef, and Marianne, a waitress in downtown Manhattan.
Reception.
Dwight Garner, in a review for "The New York Times", wrote "Power can go overboard on the grungy poetics ... and she clutters up her story with the kind of fripperies ... that felt dated 5 or 10 years ago." but also called "Crawling at Night" "the work of a formidable young writer" and compared Power's writing to Mary Gaitskill and Denis Johnson. A "Guardian" review wrote "Power's writing is stellar, her sentences popping like fireworks into gorgeous explosions of evocation, visceral, crisp and unexpected. A man with her talent might use it to call attention to his skilfulness, but Power's pyrotechnics never takes you outside the story."
"Crawling at Night" has also been reviewed by "Publishers Weekly", "Kirkus Reviews", 
It was nominated for a 2001 "Los Angeles Times" Book Prize, was a 2001 "New York Times" notable book, and appeared on the Orange Award longlist.

Sturdza Palace

The Sturdza Palace at Miclăușeni or Sturdza Castle at Miclăușeni () is a historic monument in the village of Miclăușeni, at a distance of 20 km from Roman and 65 km from the City of Iasi. Currently, it is part of the Miclăușeni Historic Monastery complex, designated by the Romanian Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony in 2015. The historic complex is composed of the following monuments:
History.
Original Manor.
In 1410, Voivode Alexander the Good "(Alexandru cel Bun)" granted a fief to boyar and member of Sfatul Domnesc "("Prince's Council")", Miclăuş, an estate located near the Siret River plains. After the death of the noble, the estate became known by his namesake, Miclăuşeni. On April 25, 1591, the nobleman's descendants sold the estate to treasurer Simon Stroici (1550-1623), who built a mansion on the property and fortified the village of Miclăuşeni in 1598. The ruins of the first mansion could still be seen as late as the beginning of the twentieth century.
In his last will and testament dated June 5, 1622, Simon Stroici bequeathed the estate and village of Miclauseni to Lupu Prăjăscu, stating:
 "Lupului Prăjăscului şi nepoatei mele Saftei, şi fiului meu, la Gligorie, cu heleştee şi cu prisăci şi cu tot venitul, pentru că i-am luat spre dânşii ca să-mi fie ei ficiori de suflet.
In 1697, the descendants of Lupu Prăjăscu, whom had no survivors, gave the estate to distant relatives, brothers Ion and Sandu Sturdza. April 19, 1699, the Sturdza brothers divided the estate with Miclăuşeni being awarded to Ion Sturdza. Feudal peasants and gypsies worked the land, whose descendants to this day have surnames describing their feudal professions; Bucătaru(Chef), Muraru(Mill worker), Pitaru (Baker), Curelaru (leather cutter), Mindirigiu (mattress maker), Bivolaru (livestock hearder), Surugiu (coachman), as described by Romanian Historian in his book "Castelul Miclăușeni în cultura română"(Miclăușeni Castle and Romanian Culture) (Ed. "Cronica", Iași, 1996).
In 1752, Lord Ioan Sturdza rebuilt the boyar mansion, building it with a semi-basement and cross-shaped ground level. The mansion had 20 rooms, ten of them on each floor. Race horses were housed in the Manor's stable. The floor and ceilings were made of wood beam and wood planks. It is said that the housekeepers had their work cut out for them dealing with the mice and bugs that roamed the residence, with the Master of the Manor giving the following orders:
"să se puie în var vreo doftorie de ploşniţă şi să speli cu aceea şi podelele pe sus cu badanaua“, în timp ce „bortele de şoareci să se astupe toate cu cărbuni pisaţi cu steclă"
Concerned with the expansion of the estate, the son of Ion Strudza, Dimitrie, built a church in the vicinity of the palace in 1821-1823. He adorned the church with baroque-style icons and numerous valuable objects. The son of Dimitrie, Alecu Sturdza Miclăuşanu, built a park of 42-hectares all stylized as an English Garden with ornamental tree species and numerous flower beds. Alecu, as a hobby, dealt in the collection and preservation of rare books and manuscripts, which further added to the richness of the Palace. Even future Prime Minister Mihail Kogălniceanu spoke of the rare books and manuscripts collected by the estate.
Although cousin to Prince Mihail Strudza (1834-1849), Alecu Strudza embraced the ideas of the Revolutionaries of 1848. He died in 1848 of cholera, under suspicion that he was poisoned by the Prince. His mark upon the estate was a high-degree of maintenance and precision on the English Gardens and Park on the estate grounds. He was buried in the manor's church, leaving the estate to the widow Catina. She passed the estate to her son, George A. Strudza in 1863, whom built the Sturdza Palace as seen today
Construction of the Palace.
In 1869, George Sturdza married Maria, the daughter of writer Ion Ghica, moving the family into the Manor. Maria, 11 years younger than George, was unsettled in her new environment and in the Manor. Eager to remake the Manor building, George Sturdza sold off several forests from the Estate and took out a loan of 100,000 Lei from the Romanian Land Credit Society "("Societatea de Credit Funciar Român")". He placed the Miclăuşeni Estate as collateral, agreeing to pay back the debts in gold coins.
Between 1880 and 1904, George Sturdza built on the site of the old Manor the late Gothic architectural palace that exists today. He wanted the Palace complex to mimic the feudal castles of the West, also be reminiscent of the Palace of Culture in Iasi, and lastly also of the in Ruginoasa.
The Palace was used as a home for orphans under Communist rule, counter to the wishes of daughter Catherine Sturdza who became a nun and donated the property to become a nunnery, which it finally became in 1990.

Alivecor

AliveCor is a medical device and artificial intelligence company that sells ECG hardware and software for consumer mobile devices. The company is the first to receive FDA-clearance for a medical-device accessory to the Apple Watch.
History.
The company was co-founded by David Albert, a medical doctor and former chief clinical scientist of cardiology at General Electric, along with scientists Bruce Satchwell and Kim Barnett. Albert began working on ECGs for handheld computers in 1990, when the first palm top computer was released by Hewlett-Packard. He received a 1998 patent, along with Satchwell and Barnett, for wireless transmission of ECGs in handheld devices.
In December 2010, Albert demonstrated a prototype of an iPhone ECG through a YouTube video. After the video received attention from the media, Albert was approached by venture capitalists and industry partners to fund the new company. AliveCor received its first $3 million in financing in 2011.
An FDA-approved smart-phone case that works as an ECG was released by AliveCor in 2012. AliveCor ran two clinical trials to test the hardware and the app. The first study investigated how its single-lead ECG compared to a traditional 12-lead device. The second study looked at whether 54 participants with no medical training could determine how to work the phone case. The latter study passed FDA clearance and led to the diagnosis of two serious heart conditions.
The company later released a credit-card sized device. The device required placing finger tips on its sensors for 30 seconds to get a medical-grade ECG reading. The data was sent to the cloud where it could be read by physicians.
While its first ECG devices relied on doctors to analyze the readings, in 2015, the company received multiple clearances by the FDA to offer algorithmic analysis of readings to determine certain heart rhythm problems.
The company hired former Google and Microsoft executive Vic Gundotra as its CEO in November 2016. Gundotra subsequently hired two senior Google engineers to run hardware and software for Alivecor. Frank Petterson, an engineering lead at YouTube, became VP of engineering. Simon Prakash, a senior director at Google's hardware unit, became VP of products and design.
By 2017, the company's software was using neural networks to "train" its products to detect heart problems. The network uses four convolutional layers, with two tied to 300,000 parameters and takes about seven minutes to train on a new user. After about a month of product use, the software builds a heart profile of the specific user, a data-driven model that can detect problems, including how the electrical system within a heart is firing.
AliveCor had recorded about 20 million ECGs by November 2017.
By the end of 2017, the FDA had cleared the KardiaBand ECG reader as a medical device accessory to the Apple Watch. The KardiaBand had been approved for use in Europe earlier in the year. A study by the Cleveland Clinic showed the KardiaBand could distinguish between atrial fibrillation and a normal heart rhythm with 93 percent sensitivity and 94 percent specificity; sensitivity increased to 99 percent with physician review of the reading. 
In 2017, the company was conducting research with Columbia University and the Mayo Clinic to determine if the KardiaBand can identify early warning signs of Long QT syndrome, a cause of sudden death, especially in young people.
The device has multiple veterinary applications. Recently it has been shown to be an effective tool for collecting ECG data in goats.
AliveCor presented research in March 2018 that it conducted with the Mayo Clinic showing that the KardiaBand can detect hyperkalemia, elevated levels of potassium in the blood, with 90% to 94% accuracy. Existing tests for the condition require laboratory blood tests. To create the detection method, a dataset with 2 million ECGs linked to 4 million serum potassium values, collected over 23 years was analysed using artificial intelligence (AI). The company said it would pursue clinical trials and FDA-clearance for the detection method.
As of 2021, AliveCor products had been tested in about 160 clinical studies published in peer-reviewed journals.
Fast Company ranked AliveCor number one in artificial intelligence in its 2018 list of the "World's Most Innovative Companies."
In February 2018, founding CEO Vic Gundotra left the company and Ira Bahr was appointed as interim CEO. Priya Abani, formerly the general manager and director of Alexa at Amazon, was hired as the new CEO in July 2019.
In 2019, the company ended sales of the KardiaBand ECG reader. 
In March 2020, AliveCor announced the appointment of Siva Somayajula as its Chief Technology Officer. Somayajula formerly served as a Director of Product Software and Services for consumer electronics at Amazon.
Products.
KardiaMobile.
KardiaMobile is a smartphone-connected ECG recorder for personal use. The user places his or her fingertips on a chewing gum-stick sized device for about 30 seconds and the results are sent to the user's smartphone. The results can be read by the user and also e-mailed to a physician. It was cleared by the FDA in 2012 for detecting atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm.
KardiaPro.
KardiaPro is a platform for doctors to monitor their patients using Kardia devices. The platform alerts doctors when a patient's device detects an abnormality. KardiaPro also tracks patient risk factors, including weight, activity and blood pressure and analyzes them with AI to alert doctors to potential issues.
KardiaBand.
The KardiaBand was a wrist-band ECG reader for the Apple Watch used to detect atrial fibrillation, approved by the FDA in 2017. The device's SmartRhythm software used artificial intelligence to continuously analyze data from the built-in heart-rate sensor and accelerometer to spot unexpected patterns. Unusual patterns prompted the user to take a 30-second ECG on the device by touching a wristband sensor. Sales of the KardiaBand ended in 2019, after later generations of the Apple Watch incorporated built in ECG sensors.
KardiaMobile 6L.
The KardiaMobile 6L is an FDA-cleared personal 6-lead ECG device. The KardiaMobile and the KardiaMobile 6L can detect the three most common arrhythmias—atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tachycardia or normal heart rhythm. KardiaCare subscribers can access the devices’ advanced determinations including Sinus Rhythm with Supraventricular Ectopy (SVE), Sinus Rhythm with Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs), and Sinus Rhythm with Wide QRS. The additional leads from the KardiaMobile 6L allow physicians to see detailed information on a patient's ECG recording.
Financing.
In 2020, AliveCor raised $65 million in series E funding led by Omron with Khosla Ventures, WP Global Partners, Qualcomm Ventures and Bold Capital Partners. This follows the raising $30 million in funding from medical-device maker Omron and the Mayo Clinic in 2017. Previous investors include Burrill Life Sciences Capital. Kearny Partners and Oklahoma Life Science are also investors.

Sztuka kochania

Sztuka kochania (Polish title; literally "The Art of Loving") published in English as A Practical Guide to Marital Bliss) is a popular sex manual written by the pioneering Polish sexologist Michalina Wisłocka, first published in 1978. The book has achieved great publishing success. About 7 million copies were sold in Poland, not including pirated reprints.
Description.
The book is considered the first guide to sexual life in a communist country. The author describes methods of contraception, a list of sexual positions and games, historical texts on love talk and methods of satisfying the sexual needs of lonely people. On the other hand, the author of "Sztuka kochania" also talks a lot about love and the need to understand another human being.
2016 republication.

Christian Kälin

Christian H. Kälin (born 1971) is a Swiss lawyer, author and the chairman of Henley &amp; Partners, a firm that specializes in helping clients acquire alternative residence and citizenship.
Early life and education.
Kälin was born in 1971 in Zurich. In his teenage years, he began collecting immigration and citizenship laws from different countries, writing to embassies to request copies of their legislations and keeping the documents in a big binder. He told writer and journalist Atossa Araxia Abrahamian of this time in his life: "What always fascinated me was the inclusionary and exclusionary aspect of citizenship [...] I wanted to understand how different countries handled this." Kälin studied in Paris, Auckland and Zurich and earned master's and PhD degrees in law from the University of Zurich. His doctoral thesis was published under the title "Ius Doni: The Acquisition of Citizenship by Investment." In the thesis, he wrote in support of citizenship by investment, arguing that it "creates social and economic development opportunities for States."
Career.
Kälin is the chairman of Henley &amp; Partners.
He is known for pioneering the concept of "citizenship-by-investment", whereby people can acquire citizenship in return for investing in a country of which they are not a national.
Kälin and Henley &amp; Partners have worked with the governments of Antigua and Barbuda, Austria, Australia, Cyprus, Greece, Grenada, Malta, Montenegro, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Thailand. Kälin states that "citizenship is inherently unjust".
In 2007, Kälin worked with the Government of St Kitts and Nevis to reform their Citizenship-by-Investment program and to initiate the Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation impacting the transition of the shuttered sugar industry.
In 2010, Kälin was introduced to SCL Group and its CEO Alexander Nix during the St. Kitts and Nevis 2010 election campaign. Both sides stated that there was never a formal working relationship between them and that the exchange of ideas and information that took place between them was a natural and normal consequence of their operating in the same region and countries since many years.
Kälin was the lead consultant in the creation and implementation of the Citizenship-by-Investment program of Antigua and Barbuda in 2013. In 2014, Kälin was appointed chairman of Henley &amp; Partners following many years in different senior roles at the firm.
In May 2017, Kälin consulted with Malta's Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, and Minister of Justice, Owen Bonnici together with law firm Mishcon de Reya, to write to the investigative journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, in an attempt to get her to remove blog posts critical of him. Daphne Caruana Galizia was a fierce critic of Malta's citizenship by investment program.

Bigger (album)

Bigger is the sixth studio album by American country music duo Sugarland. It was released on June 8, 2018, through Big Machine Records. This is their first album in 8 years since 2010's "The Incredible Machine", and first on Big Machine.
Background.
After a five-year hiatus, at the 51st Annual CMA Awards, Bush and Nettles reunited to present Vocal Duo of the Year. Nettles mentioned all the years that Sugarland won Vocal Duo of the Year, "2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011…and well, who knows?", teasing new music from the duo. After the ceremony, the two tweeted a photo of themselves at the CMA's with the caption #StillTheSame. 
The lead single "Still the Same" was released on December 21, 2017. Sugarland announced the album, album title and track listing on April 12, 2018. One of the songs on the album, "Babe" features American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. Swift wrote the song with Train frontman Patrick Monahan for her 2012 album "Red" but the song didn't release in the album. After the CMA's Swift got in touch with Sugarland, told them how excited she was that they were getting back together and mentioned she had a song for them. This is the first song Sugarland have recorded that wasn't written by Bush and Nettles.
Promotion.
Sugarland performed for the first time in five years at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin Eve With Ryan Seacrest 2018, and performed "Still the Same". On May 8, 2018 they performed their second single "Babe" on "Live with Kelly and Ryan" becoming the debut televised performance of the song; the duo then performed the title-track "Bigger" off-camera just for the studio audience.
The duo supported the album on the "Still the Same Tour" which began on May 4, 2018, in Durant, Oklahoma and concluded later in the year on September 9, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Singles.
"Still the Same" is the lead single from the album and was released on December 21, 2017.
"Babe" featuring Taylor Swift, the second single from the album, was released on April 20, 2018.
Promotional singles.
The title-track, "Bigger", was released as a promotional single on April 12, 2018. "Mother" was released April 27, 2018 as another promotional single.
Critical reception.
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of All Music gave it four out of five star rating saying, that the album "does indeed deliver on its titular promise to be a grand, majestic album, but emotions are not in its skyscraper sweep." Brittany McKenna of "Rolling Stone" was positive saying, "The arrangements of "Bigger" are grander, the vocals more theatrical, and the themes – which occasionally veer into the political – decidedly more topical. The album takes cue from current trends while adamantly retaining the spirit that made their songs like "Stay" such massive hits. In other words, it's still a Sugarland record, but one tailor-made for our odd moment, where female voices like Nettles' are louder than ever thanks to movements like #MeToo and Time's Up but still largely missing from country radio." Jermey Burchard of "Wide Open Country" describes the album as "their best yet", and they "are coming back into the county landscape at more creative and promising timing."
Commercial performance.
"Bigger" debuted at No. 2 on Top Country Albums based on 30,000 album equivalent units, 26,000 of which are traditional album sales. It sold another 5,000 copies (7,600 units) the second week. It has sold 57,500 copies in the United States as of December 2018.

Albatross (Corrosion of Conformity song)

"Albatross" is a song by American heavy metal band Corrosion of Conformity. It was released as the lead single from the band's fourth studio album, "Deliverance". Written by vocalist/guitarist Pepper Keenan and drummer Reed Mullin, "Albatross" was a hit on rock radio, peaking at No. 19 on the "Billboard" Mainstream Rock chart. The song is the band's highest charting single along with "Clean My Wounds", which also peaked at No. 19.
Background.
"Albatross" was the first song recorded for "Deliverance" and the first song the band had written after the exit of vocalist Karl Agell. In a departure from previous COC songs, "Albatross" has a strong classic rock influence, especially the Lynyrd Skynyrd-style guitar outro. Of the style change, vocalist Pepper Keenan said, "The way we were thinking back then, the hardcore thing was getting so stale. It seemed that everyone was doin' the same fuckin' thing, and for us to write the song 'The Albatross' felt more punk rock than anything anyone was doing at the time. People were pissed off at us. But it finally felt real again."
Musical style.
In his review of the album, AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia referred to the song as a "slower, groovier number".
Use in other media.
"Albatross" was featured in the 2009 video game "".
