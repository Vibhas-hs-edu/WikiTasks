Akaa Solar System Scale Model

Akaa Solar System Scale Model is located at the center of the city of Akaa, Finland. The Sun is located at the school campus of Toijalan Yhteiskoulu –school in Toijala district. The scale of the model is 1 : 3 000 000 000, meaning that each centimetre in the scale model represents 30 000 km in real life. The Sun is 464 mm in diameter and the Earth is 4 mm in diameter and located 49.86 meters away from the Sun. Neptune is 1500 meters away from the Sun, for example. Akaa Solar System Scale Model was built in 2017 by amateur astronomer Kari-Pekka Arola.
A walking tour of Akaa Solar System Scale Model starts from the Sun and all the planets are located northbound from the Sun. The walking route goes through the center of Toijala and towards the port of Toijala, where the furthest dwarf planet in the scale model, Eris is located. All the planets and most notable dwarf planets are included in the scale model. The current location (140 AU) of "Voyager 1" -spacecraft in relation to the Solar System is also presented in the scale model (as the most distant man-made spacecraft) and the concrete pillar representing its location is at the center of the neighbouring town Viiala, approximately 7 km away from the Sun. 
The speed of light in the scale model is exactly 10 cm/second, so walking the 50-meter distance from the Earth to Sun "at light speed" takes 8 minutes and 20 seconds. 
Scale model of Proxima Centauri in Australia.
In 2018 scale model of Proxima Centauri -star was added to Akaa Solar System Scale Model. Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf star and the nearest star to the Solar System. It is located 4.24 light-years away and in the model's scale it has a diameter of about 72 mm and it is located 13 370 km away from Akaa. This ground distance takes it in the middle of Australia and near the famous Ayers Rock / Uluru. The scale model of Proxima Centauri is placed at the nearby town of Yulara, in the Town Square visitor centre. This addition of Proxima Centauri demonstrates the differences of planetary distances vs. the stellar distances in the universe. 
A map and info of the walking tour is available at the website of the city of Akaa.

Aftermath.
On July 24, 2015, WWE terminated their contract with Hogan, stating that they are "committed to embracing and celebrating individuals from all backgrounds", although Hogan's lawyer said Hogan chose to resign. A day prior, WWE removed virtually all references to Hogan from their website, including his entry from its WWE Hall of Fame page. The termination coincided with the publication by the "National Enquirer" and Radar Online of an anti-black rant made by Hogan on his controversial leaked sex tape in which he is heard expressing disgust with the notion of his daughter with any black man, referenced by repeated use of the racial slur "nigger". Hogan also admitted to being "a racist, to a point". However, no official statement about his removal had been made and he was still listed in the Hall of Fame entry of the official WWE encyclopedia released in October 2016.
On July 15, 2018, despite no prior official statements by the WWE declaring his removal from the Hall of Fame, Hogan was reinstated into the Hall of Fame, after his numerous public apologies over the past year, as well as volunteering work.

La Vaughn Belle

La Vaughn Belle is an artist from the United States Virgin Islands who uses a variety of media including drawings, paintings, woodwork, ceramics, photography, and video. She is best known for co-creating with Jeannette Ehlers the 23-foot tall statue “I Am Queen Mary,” the first public statue of a black woman in Denmark, featuring labor leader Mary Thomas.
Biography.
Belle was born in the village of Moriah on the island of Tobago, but moved to the St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands when she was an infant and considers herself a native. Her mother is from Tobago and her father is from Barbados. She attended Columbia University in New York, and in her junior year she took a painting class and decided to become an artist. However, she had already switched her major from Pre-Med to English, and couldn't switch majors again. After receiving her bachelor's degree, she started teaching and moved back to St. Croix. She received an MFA at el Instituto Superior de Arte in Cuba in 2005.
Works.
Belle considers herself a contemporary artist and has stated she likes her art to speak "in layers." She seeks to undermine and challenge the European-based hierarchical caste system in the Caribbean, which she believes places people of African descent at the bottom of the social pyramid. She regularly incorporates colonial artifacts into her work.
"Somebody’s Been Sitting In My Chair".
Belle created the video performance “Somebody’s Been Sitting In My Chair” where Goldilocks walks into a Great House. Inside displays several people sitting in a planter's chair. It is meant to reflect the taboo surrounding not being able to touch anything in a Caribbean Great House.
“Chaney” pieces.
These feature broken ceramics from China and Denmark that often resurface after it rains in the Virgin Islands.
"I Am Queen Mary" statue.
Denmark was an active participant in the transatlantic slave trade and greatly benefitted from it, though has never officially apologized. Belle co-created the statue "I Am Queen Mary" with fellow black artist Jeannette Ehlers to challenge "Denmark’s collective memory" about slavery. The 23-foot statue depicts Mary Thomas, who helped lead the 1878 "Fireburn" labor riot in St. Croix where workers in the Danish West Indies staged a protest. She sits on a peacock chair, recalling “the iconic 1967 photograph of Huey P. Newton, founder of the Black Panther Party” and the plinth incorporates “coral cut from the ocean by enslaved Africans gathered from ruins of the foundations of historic buildings on St. Croix.” In one hand she holds a torch, and the other holds a West Indian cane bill (a tool for cutting sugarcane cutting), which the artists state symbolizes the “resistance strategies” of the enslaved people who toiled in Danish colonies.

Paige v. Banks

Paige v. Banks, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 608 (1872), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held an agreement that transfers a copyright from the original author to a second party for perpetuity does not end with the statutory limit of copyright at the time the parties made the deal. If a later act of Congress extends copyright and the extension is available to the work, the second party still controls the copyright or perpetual license to that copyright.
This is a notable departure from the Statute of Anne, a 1709 law from Great Britain that was influential in the United States's copyright history. That statute, from which the United States borrowed for the Copyright Act of 1790, provided for a maximum of two fourteen year terms of the author controlling a work's copyright monopoly before it entered the public domain. Under that British scheme, an author could sign away their copyright during the first term and it would automatically return to them at the beginning of the second term.

Fishbase identifies the species as extinct, formerly occupying the Orontes watershed in Turkey, however a synonym, "Hemigrammocapoeta caudomaculata" is identified as least concern by the IUCN, and is found in the Asi drainage in Turkey and Syria and Nahr al-Kabir at the border between Syria and Lebanon, and called the Asi golden barb.

The spinysnout pipefish ("Halicampus spinirostris") is a species of marine pipefish of the family Syngnathidae. It is found in the Indo-Pacific, from Sri Lanka to Samoa, and from Japan and the Marshall Islands to central Australia. It lives in rocky and coral reefs, rubble, lagoons and intertidal zones, often at depths of , where it can grow to lengths of . It is expected to feed on small crustaceans, similar to other pipefish. This species is ovoviviparous, with males carrying eggs in a brood pouch before giving birth to live young.
Identification.
"H. spinirostris" is pale to dark brown coloured, with four alternating thick dark and thin white bars. It can be recognized by its distinctive spines on the snout.

Gene Merlino

Gene Merlino (born 5 April 1928) is a retired singer and musician, known for providing the singing voice of Lancelot in the musical film "Camelot", and for being part of the Grammy Award winning quartet, The Anita Kerr Singers.
Early life.
Gene Merlino was born Mario Gino Merlino on April 5, 1928, in San Francisco, California, to Cesare and Teresa (née Incaviglia) Merlino. His first exposure to music came from his two older brothers; John was an accomplished accordionist, and Victor took up the clarinet but did not stick with it for long. Gene originally wanted to play trumpet, as he admired Harry James, but instead picked up the available clarinet in his early teens. A few years later he had learned the saxophone well enough to start playing for dances and weddings near his Potrero Hill neighborhood.
After graduating from Mission High School he enrolled in San Francisco State as a Music major, playing clarinet and achieving first chair concertmaster in the college's symphonic band by his sophomore year. He also spent one semester at Eastman School of Music.
Career.
Radio.
In 1950, Merlino left college before graduating when he got his first steady musical job with the Bill Weaver show on KCBS radio, which at that time broadcast out of the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. Although he initially only played saxophone, he soon became the regular male vocalist, performing five nights a week. At this time he "realized that singing was going to be [his] main career in music". He stayed with KCBS for three years before moving to Los Angeles, California.
Jazz Bands.
After arriving in Los Angeles, Merlino joined the jazz bands of Frankie Carle, then Ray Anthony. Anthony then started his short-lived television variety show, The Ray Anthony Show, in 1956, allowing Merlino to be seen by a nationwide audience. When the Anthony show was canceled in May 1957 after only one season, Merlino joined the Freddy Martin band, who played regularly at the famous Cocoanut Grove club in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Merlino remained with this band until 1963.
Television.
Beginning in 1963 and continuing through 1979, Merlino was a regular performer for many television variety shows, starting with "The Red Skelton Show". He would eventually become a regular for "The Pearl Bailey Show", "The Judy Garland Show", the "Carol Burnett Show", "The Julie Andrews Hour", the "Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour", "Donny &amp; Marie", and the Ken Berry "Wow" Show.
In later years, his vocals could be heard on "The Simpsons". He performed the song "Born Free" on the episode "Whacking Day", "South of the Border" on "Kamp Krusty", and "Jellyfish" in "A Star Is Born Again".
Studio Recordings and Film.
In 1956 he providing the singing voice for the character of Tom Robinson Lee, played by John Kerr, in the 1956 movie Tea and Sympathy.
In 1965 he was part of the four-man singing group that recorded the theme song for Gilligan's Island. In 1966, Merlino joined the male singing quartet, The Mellomen, with Thurl Ravenscroft, Bill Lee and Bill Cole, after Max Smith retired. Thanks to this, Merlino began to get regular work as a session singer in the various recording studios in Hollywood and Los Angeles, eventually singing for thousands of movies, television programs, radio and television commercials, audio recordings, and song poems, during a career that lasted more than 50 years.
His most famous recordings were as part of the Anita Kerr Singers, who won a 1967 Grammy Award (Best Performance by a Vocal Group) for their performance of "A Man and a Woman" (along with a 1969 Edison Award), and for providing the singing voice for the character of Lancelot, played by Franco Nero, in the 1967 movie Camelot. In 1973 he was part of the chorus who went on a worldwide tour with Burt Bacharach to promote the movie Lost Horizon, the Singer in Charlotte's Web for which Bacharach wrote the music.
Additionally, Merlino was part of the "L.A. Voices", who were nominated for a Grammy Award (Best Jazz Vocal Performance - Duo or Group) in 1982 he did one of the Chorus in Heidi's Song, in 1983 for the Supersax album "Supersax &amp; L.A. Voices". and he did one of the Additional Voices in The Little Mermaid. He also claims to have recorded more than 10,000 song poems, primarily under the pseudonyms Gene Marshall or John Muir, and was featured in the 2003 PBS documentary "Off the Charts".
Personal life.
Merlino married Lois Elizabeth Draper on November 18, 1953. Merlino met Draper in the symphonic band at San Francisco State, where she played flute. Almost immediately after marrying they moved to the North Hollywood region of Los Angeles, so Gene could foster his singing career, as there was much more studio recording work available in Hollywood and Los Angeles than in San Francisco. They had two children, Monica (b. 1954) and John (b. 1963). They lived in various parts of Los Angeles until 1995, when they moved to Camarillo, California. Their marriage lasted for 55 years until Lois died on April 3, 2009, at the age of 78.

S.V. Setty

Sriram Venkatasubba Setty (IAST: ) popularly known as S.V. Setty (1879–1918) was an Indian aviator and professor from Mysore, Karnataka, India. He was known as the first Indian aviator, assisting with the design of the Avro 504.
S.V. Setty was also a founder professor of Karnataka's first engineering college, University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering, Bangalore.
Early life and education.
Setty was born on 12 December 1879, in Mysore. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Maharaja's College before enrolling in the engineering college at Guindy, Madras, Tamil Nadu. From Guindy, he transferred to Thomason College and then to Roorkee, where he completed his engineering degree.
In his early days, he worked in the Mysore Public Works Department as an assistant engineer until 1909. He won a scholarship from the Mysore government to Faraday House, London, where he studied for a diploma in electrical engineering. He gained practical experience at firms in Rugby, Wolverhampton and London. During this time, he also became an associate member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers.
Aviation career.
In May 1911, Setty joined A.V. Roe and Company (AVRO), at that time the only British company specializing in building aircraft in England. On 12 March 1912, he built an aircraft with some help and tested it. His first flight was successful, even at low power. John Robertson Duigan, impressed by the maiden trial flight, complimented Setty and he even concluded a deal with Avro. This aircraft was later named the Avro Duigan.
Setty's aircraft design then became the basis for Avro 500 series built by A. V. Roe. Later, in May 1912, he started designing a new biplane aircraft. The design was published in the "Modern Review" monthly magazine (July 1912, India), and it was different from the Avro 500. After completing its design, on 30 June 1912 he left for India, On 12 June 1912, Setty received a gold medal by A. V. Roe for General Proficiency in Aeronautics.
After Setty left for India, Avro released the 500 series of aircraft, including the Avro 501, 502, 503 and 504. All of these, except the Avro 504, were similar to Avro 500 aircraft in basic design. The new biplane aircraft which Setty had designed turned out to be Avro 504, a popular World War I bomber. The Avro 504 evolved into the world's first trainer aircraft, In November 1914, the Avro 504 was the first aircraft to bomb Germany in the war. Setty designed the Avro Duigan which became the model for Avro 500 and then designed the new biplane the Avro 504.
Later years.
In 1913, a technical school was established in Bangalore in a shed-like structure headed by S.V. Setty as the superintendent, after his return from England. He became a founder professor of Karnataka's first engineering college, University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering, Bangalore.
Death.
The 1918 influenza epidemic killed about a fifth of Bangalore's residents, including Setty, his wife, and one of their four daughters. He died on 12 October 1918 at the age of 38.

Construction Research and Innovation Strategy Panel

The Construction Research and Innovation Strategy Panel (CRISP) was an initiative established in 1995 to identify and prioritise the research needs of the construction industry of the United Kingdom. It operated through a series of Task Groups, each dealing with a particular research topic, and each of which produced a report published on the CRISP website. Collated recommendations were passed to appropriate funding bodies. In 2005, CRISP was absorbed into the National Platform for the Built Environment. 
History.
In 1995, CRISP was given responsibility for advising the then Department of the Environment on priorities for research and innovation, and was based at the Building Research Establishment in Garston, Hertfordshire, near Watford. 
Operation between 1998 and 2003.
From 1998 Davis Langdon Consultancy provided management support.
Between 1998 and 2002, 13 Task Groups covering topics such as "design", "sustainable construction", "performance" and "value" produced 233 recommendations. 
In 2000, 2001 and 2002, the requirements identified by the groups were used to form action plans for the Department of Trade and Industry, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the Economic and Social Research Council, the Highways Agency, and the Environment Agency.
New CRISP (nCRISP) from 2002-3.
New CRISP was formed in 2002-3. An awayday in March 2003 identified a set of 10 research priorities which were incorporated in the nCRISP Business Plan published in October 2003. nCRISP Task Groups were established as follows: 
nCRISP also commissioned a report by economist David Pearce, "The Social and Economic Value of Construction". All the groups presented progress reports to the nCRISP Awayday in October 2004, and they were finalised in early 2005. They were discussed at the offices of Mace on 16 May 2005.
nCRISP was subsequently absorbed into the National Platform for the Built Environment, and ring-fenced government funding for sectors like construction ended, and construction had to compete for funding with sectors such as aerospace and pharmaceuticals.
Legacy and impact.
The Design Task Group's report was turned into a book chapter by the group's chair, Giles Oliver. After chairing the Task Group on Value, Richard Saxon went on to publish "Be Valuable" through the industry body Constructing Excellence, while the Task Group report was used as the source of an academic paper. The Pearce Report "The Social and Economic Value of Construction" (2003) was used for a special issue of the journal "Building Research &amp; Information", edited by Jim Meikle.

Joëlle Coutaz

Joëlle Coutaz is a French computer scientist, specializing in human-computer interaction (HCI). Her career includes research in the fields of operating systems and HCI, as well as being a professor at the University of Grenoble. Coutaz is considered a pioneer in HCI in France, and in 2007, she was awarded membership to SIGCHI. She was also involved in organizing CHI conferences and was a member on the editorial board of "ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction". She has authored over 130 publications, including two books, in the domain of human-computer interaction.
Career.
In 1970, Coutaz received her PhD in computer science from Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble, France, where she specialized in operating systems. She then worked as a software engineer for French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). In 1972, she worked on the first packet switching network at the University of Grenoble, and later became an assistant professor for the university until 1991. She was a visiting scientist at Carnegie Mellon University from 1983 to 1984.
Coutaz's research interests shifted from operating systems to human-computer interaction after attending a CHI conference in 1983. She would then become a pioneer in HCI in France, by bridging the domain with software engineering. In 1988, she obtained her Thèse d'Etat in human-computer interaction from Joseph Fourier University. Then in 1991, she became a full professor at University of Grenoble.
In 1990, Coutaz founded and directed CLIPS, an HCI group at the Laboratory of Informatics in Grenoble. She co-founded two groups part of the CNRS national programme on computer-supported cooperative work and multimodal HCI. Furthermore, she became the co-chief editor of the Journal of Interaction between Persons and Systems. Between 1989 and 1995, she contributed to the AMODEUS project by ESPRIT BRA/LTR, whose purpose was to promote a multidisciplinary approach to human-computer interaction. In 2008, Coutaz coordinated a group working on ambient intelligence for the Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and Innovation, with the purpose of confronting societal challenges in novel ways. The group took on the creation of a field that intersects information and communication technologies, and social and human sciences.
As of 2012, she is professor emeritus from the University of Grenoble.
Research.
After achieving her PhD in 1970, Coutaz pursued her research interests in operating systems and computer networks. However, her research interests shifted to human-computer interaction in 1983 after attending a CHI conference. In this newer domain, her work focused on software architecture modeling for interactive systems, multimodal interaction, augmented reality, and user interface plasticity. In 1987, she created the presentation-abstraction-control (PAC) model, a software architecture model for interactive systems. In 1993, Coutaz began to work with Laurence Nigay to combine the PAC model with ARCH, a model designed for the implementation of multimodal user interfaces. She has also contributed to projects on a European and national level. Coutaz is currently working on end-user software engineering for smart homes in the field of ubiquitous computing.
FAME.
From 2001 to 2004, Coutaz contributed to FAME at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The goal of the project was to create an intelligent agent which could facilitate communication between people of different cultures when solving a common problem. Their solution made use of multimodal interactions, including vision, speech, and object manipulation to create and manipulate new information based on the context.
CAMELEON.
CAMELEON's purpose was to build methods and environments which support the design and development of context-dependent interfaces. They focused on methods which would promote the creation of software interfaces that are usable on various devices.
CONTINUUM.
Between 2008 and 2011, Coutaz contributed to CONTINUUM. The project addressed the problem of service continuity within the long-term vision of ambient intelligence, and defined models that support service continuity for mobile users. Three key scientific issues were addressed: context management and awareness, semantic heterogeneity, and human control versus system autonomy.
UsiXML (ITEA).
From 2009 to 2012, Coutaz contributed to UsiXML by Information Technology for European Advancement (ITEA 2). UsiXML is a markup language for user interfaces, in which UI can be designed at different levels of abstraction.
AppsGate.
Between 2012 and 2015, Coutaz contributed to AppsGate. Their goal was to create software that would allow non-engineers to create their own programs for their environment. With the rise of IoT, their focus was on programmable smart home devices.

Wacyk-Tyrala WT-1

The WT-1 was a 1931 high performance sports aircraft designed in Poland. It only made two flights.
Design and development.
Stanisław Wacyk and Tadeuz Tyrala designed the WT-1 during 1930 and they largely financed the construction of its fuselage at the Aviation Circle of the Industrial School at Kraków and wings in the workshops of the Kraków Air Regiment. It was completed in the summer of 1931.
The high performance sports aircraft was an aerodynamically clean cantilever wing monoplane. Its high-mounted, one piece wing was built around two spars, with a plywood covered leading edge and fabric covering. Narrow chord ailerons occupied the whole of the trailing edges.
The WT-1's borrowed de Havilland Gipsy I four cylinder upright inline engine was mounted largely exposed, though with a fairing behind it. The ply-covered fuselage had rounded decking; the fuel tank was in the forward fuselage and its two seat, side-by-side cockpit was behind the wing trailing edge. The fuselage tapered rearwards, with the tailplane mounted on top. A tall triangular fin carried a rounded rudder, which reached down to the keel. Its fixed landing gear was conventional, though details are not known.
An initial first flight was abandoned due to a fuel supply problem. The system was modified and a new fuel pump fitted, after which Stanisław Szubka piloted its first flight, finding the WT-1 hard to fly because of a misplaced centre of gravity (c.g.), and damaging it on landing. After accident repair and c.g. adjustment the WT-1 was flown by Jerzy Bajan. The take-off run was short and performance high, but Bajan found its handling dangerous. At this point the loaned Gipsy engine had to be returned to the Kraków Air Regiment and the development of the WT-1 was abandoned.

Table manners in North America

 Table manners are the cultural customs and rules of etiquette used while dining. As in other areas of North American etiquette, the rules governing appropriate table manners have changed over time and may differ depending on the setting (e.g. dining at home, at a restaurant, or with business colleagues).
History.
Table manners have an ancient and complex history, as each society has gradually evolved its system. Today, many of the behaviors that take place at the dinner table are deeply rooted in history.
In Europe, Italy more or less led the cultural revolution starting with the renaissance. Italian poet Giovanni Della Casa advised in "Galateo", his 1558 book on manners: "One should not comb his hair nor wash his hands in public... the exception to this is the washing of the hands when done before sitting down to dinner, for then it should be done in full sight of others, even if you do not need to wash them at all, so that whoever dips into the same bowl as you will be certain of your cleanliness."
Some other examples are:
Proper manners were a concern even of leaders in the society of eighteenth-century America –– Benjamin Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanac, for instance, included comments on proper behavior. During the nineteenth century, hundreds of books on etiquette were published in the United States.
In the home.
Each household may have a unique set of rules at the table, but despite cultural differences, there are some essential table manners most families share, including rules against picking one's teeth at the table and chewing with one's mouth open. Due to changing lifestyles, table manners are more casual than they were in the 1950s. For example, some commentators contend that the common prohibition against placing elbows on the table no longer applies. Today, many families eat fast food without silverware and eat meals in front of the television or in the car rather than following past norms of gathering the family at the dining table for a meal. Critics claim that these changes have led to fewer opportunities to learn table manners in the home.
Additionally, advancement of technology in recent years raises issues regarding smartphone use at the dining table. Opinions vary regarding whether the use of smartphones at the dining table is acceptable.
Offenses.
The convention of avoiding putting one's elbows on the table while eating arose from a time when tables were sufficiently rustic and unstable that leaning on them could cause loose planks to disrupt the meal. However, as time has changed, it has become more acceptable to put one's elbows on the table, but only between courses, not while eating.
The main reason to be quiet while eating is for safety. According to the National Safety Council, suffocation, especially on foods, was ranked fourth on a list of major causes of death in American homes.
 In most places, it is unacceptable for someone to make disapproving or disrespectful sounds when presented with food. Likewise, blowing one's nose at the table is unacceptable. In addition, slurping food is considered offensive and impolite.
Business related.
As business dealings can take place over a meal, table manners may be put to good use while dining with clientele, co-workers, or subordinates – building rapport with a client, celebrating the accomplishments of a team, or simply hosting a discussion in a non-office setting all call for proper etiquette if dining is involved. It is deemed an essential enough behavioral skill that has suffered from a decline in naturally occurring generational inheritance to the effect that some schools have opened programs and classes centered around dining etiquette to educate students in the practice. Poor table manners can affect the opinion of those involved, as well as the outcome of the meeting.
Many appropriate mannerisms from formal dining situations can be applied in a business setting, though variations exist depending on who is the host and who is the guest, and the relation the one has with the other. Speaking while still chewing or mid-bite may be acceptable in an informal lunch setting with often-seen coworkers, but in a high-stakes meeting with a potential customer, it will likely come off as rude. Napkins are intended to be kept in the lap. The exception is when leaving the table temporarily – placed on the chair signals the staff that the diner's meal is unfinished, placed on the table near the plate shows the patron has completed their meal.
Unless the host offers to pay the inevitable bill, it should be assumed that each diner is responsible for their own bill, and the staff (and table) should be made aware of this at the appropriate time. The former being the case typically does not mean that the most expensive item on the menu should be sought out.
The dress code for a business related dining event can vary, usually around when the event takes place. The lunch period will likely find participants wearing what they wore to work, though special events may require a higher level of dress. It is important to understand and attempt to match the formality of the event – this type of table manners begin prior to sitting down at the table.
Restaurant.
The level of formality can vary depending on the formality of the restaurant.
Proper table manners ought to begin as soon as one arrives at a table. The very first step after sitting down is place the napkin in one's lap. If the napkin is cloth, it should not be entirely unfolded and one crease should be left in placing it on the lap. With the napkin placed on the lap, it protects clothing from spills or food that may fall into the diner's lap.
It is important to be able to navigate the table setting, not only knowing which utensils to use, but which items are meant for whose use. A general rule of thumb for selecting the proper spoon or fork when provided with multiple is to start on the outside and work your way in. For example, if you are starting with a salad course and you have two forks to choose from, the fork farthest from the plate should be used, leaving the closer one for the main course. Similarly, if you start with soup, select the spoon that is farthest from the plate.
Many restaurants set the table with a bread plate and water glass at each seat before patrons arrive. The bread plate goes to the left of the plate, and the beverage to the right. To avoid drinking from the wrong glass or taking a bite of your neighbor's bread, use the following trick if you forget which is yours:Touch both your index fingers to your thumbs. On your left, you will see a lowercase "b", which stands for the bread plate. On your right is a lowercase "d" for Drinks. Dining in North America is widely viewed as a social occasion, rather than simply an opportunity to eat. As such, it is important to show the people dining with you that you respect them and their time enough to put your cell phone away. According to a study done by the Pew Research Center, 38% percent of people think it is acceptable to use cell phones in restaurants, and that number gets even smaller depending on the occasion. 12% of people think it is OK to use cell phones at family dinners, and only 5% think it is appropriate during meetings.
When it comes to paying the bill in American restaurants, adding a tip is a common custom that is often expected by the waiter. According to a study by CreditCards.com, 4 out of 5 Americans always leave a tip when dining out, and the average tip is 16%–20% of the total bill.

Alexandra Jacobi

Aleksandra Nikolayevna Susokolova (, 6 May 1841 - 1 December 1918), better known as Aleksandra Jacobi (), was Russian journalist, memoirist and publicist, translator and publisher who also used the pseudonym Toliverova and (after her third marriage) signed her work as Peshkova-Toliverova. Her portraits have been painted by her common-law husband Valery Jacobi, as well as Vasily Vereshchagin.
Biography.
Aleksandra Jacobi was born in Yegoryevsk, Ryazan Governorate, to a merchant family of Nikolai Ivanovich Susokolov and his wife Anna Ivanovna. Soon the family moved to Kazan where she attended the Jungwald boarding school for girls and later the city gymnasium. After her first marriage to Vasily Tyufyayev (a teacher at the Kazan institute for the Daughters of nobility) broke down, she moved to Saint Petersburg and in 1860 became close to a local circle of the Kazan community. She became romantically involved with Valery Jacobi, later a renowned painter, and for the next decade remained his common-law wife. Their marriage has never been registered, but she adopted "Jacobi" as her pen name and continued to use it long after the two parted.
Aleksandra Jacobi became and active member of the proto-Socialist 1860s movement in Russia and as one of this country's first feminists. In 1866, along with her husband she came to Italy and settled in Rome. A year later, she joined the Garibaldi forces as a sister of mercy and worked for a while as a Russian correspondent for "Golos", reporting from the frontlines. Arthur Benni, whom she attended to in hospital during the last days of his life, died in December 1867, apparently in her arms. Several colourful biographies dealt with her seemingly extraordinary adventures in Italy, but later it transpired (from her own diaries and notes) that much of Jacobi's life of that period has been heavily romanticised and to some extent mythologised.
Upon her return from Italy Jacobi continued a successful career in journalism and became a regular contributor to "Molva", "Birzhevye Vedomosti", "Nedelya" and "Novoye Vremya". She wrote memoirs on Garibaldi (as well as Franz Liszt and Fyodor Dostoyevsky among many others), translated numerous George Sand's fairytales into Russian and was the first translator of the poetry by Mikhail Lermontov and Nikolai Nekrasov into Italian.
Jacobi was best known in Russia as a publisher and editor of the children's magazine "Igrushechka" (Игрушечка, Little Toy, 1887-1910) which attracted a host of celebrities, among them Lev Tolstoy and Mamin-Sibiryak, as well as Nikolai Leskov, with whom Jacobi corresponded for many years. Although an active contributor, Leskov left some scathing remarks (albeit in private correspondence only) concerning this publication, once calling it "...stale old-fashion garbage, proved to be totally irrelevant... and full of hypocrisy." Maxim Gorky and Kornei Chukovsky were also among the detractors, but Anatoly Kony, a renowned Russian lawyer of the time, praised "Igrushechka" for good language, high quality translations and brilliant biographical pieces (on Alfred Tennison, Robert Fulton, George Stephenson, James Watt, Carl Linnaeus and Niccolò Paganini among many others), praising it for being a fine source of knowledge for the young readership, filled with the spirit of love, humanism and enlightenment.
Jacobi edited three more publications, "Na Pomoshch Materyam" (На помощь матерям, Helping Mothers, 1894-1904), "Zhenskoye Delo" (Женское дело, Women's Cause, 1899-1900) and "Krasnye Zori" (Красные зори, Red Sunrise, 1911-1912). She died from the complications of pneumonia on 1 December 1918 in Petrograd, Soviet Russia, and was interred in the Nikolskoe Cemetery at Alexander Nevsky Lavra.

Georg Sauter

Georg Sauter (20. April 1866 – 20. December 1937) was a German-English painter, lithographer and draftsman.
Life.
In 1880 Georg Sauter began training as a house painter and then worked in Munich with a painter master. Later he took drawing lessons. He studied painting from October 1884 in the antic class of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. There he was a pupil of the landscape painter Ludwig von Löfftz (1845-1910) and received also suggestions by the portrait painter Franz von Lenbach (1836-1904).
Georg Sauter undertook study trips to Holland, Belgium, France and Italy, then lived in London from 1889 as a painter and lithographer, where he married in 1894 Lilian Galsworthy (1864–1924), the sister of the English novelist John Galsworthy. Sauter entered a circle of artists that included the painters Hubert Herkomer, John Lavery and George Frederick Watts, the author Joseph Conrad and the poet John Masefield. He also met the American painters Joseph Pennell and James Abbott McNeill Whistler, both of whom became close friends. His works show the influence of James Whistler. His painting "The Bridal Morning", issued in 1909, won second prize in the Carnegie Art Institute's annual exhibition in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but became the cause of a scandal over its erotic mood.
With the beginning of World War I Sauter was, despite married to an Englishwoman, interned as an enemy alien in 1916 at Alexandra Palace and later expelled. First he went to Jena. Here he had support from the families of glass industrialist Otto Schott and his son-in-law Heinrich Gerland, lawyer and professor at the University of Jena. The friendship with the Gerlands arose in 1906, when Gerland, accompanied by his wife Eva, made a study trip to England and met the artist there. Sauter produced a series of portraits for the Schott family. At the recommendation of Gerland, Sauter created a series of 30 professorial portraits for the University of Jena between 1922 and 1923, which he executed as charcoal drawings. For his work Georg Sauter was appointed honorary citizen of the University of Jena in 1936.
Sauter had his residence in Rome at the beginning of the 1930s. During a stay in Cologne in 1930/31 Sauter portrayed the mayor of Cologne Konrad Adenauer and his second wife Gussi. Adenauer then recommended him to other acquaintances, including the industrialist Carl Duisberg: "He draws heads of men who interest him and combines these drawings into a collection.". Back in Germany, Sauter settled in 1933 in the artists' colony Brannenburg.
In 1898 Sauter was one of the founders and member of council of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers. He was also a corresponding member of the Vienna Secession and the Société Royale des Beaux Arts in Brussels and a member of the Deutscher Künstlerbund (Association of German Artists).
Georg Sauter was secondly married to Valda Broad (died Dec. 1937) since 1926. The son Rudolf Sauter (1895-1971) was also a portrait painter, draftsman and graphic artist. Among other things, he illustrated the works of his uncle John Galsworthy.

Valentina Murabito

Valentina Murabito (born 28 September 1981 in Giarre, Italy) is an Italian photographer and visual artist. Her photographic works are a hybrid between different art forms merging in experimental analog photography.
Early life and education.
Valentina Murabito was born in Sicily. From 2004 to 2009, she studied graphic arts at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Catania where she studied graphics software, as well as xylography, lithography and photography. In 2008, she won two scholarships to study photography at the Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design in Budapest. During this time, she created her series "Melankólikus", which unites video art, photography and video documentary. She graduated with honors. In 2009, Murabito moved to Germany and currently lives in Berlin.
Artistry.
In her pictures, Murabito creates "in-between-creatures" that do not fit into any determined category, hybrids between man and woman, human and animal. She plays with gender roles and questions the term of identity.
She experiments with analog photography, for instance, by dissolving the photographic surface in order to mold it like a skin or break it like dry earth. The artist develops her photographic work manually on baryte paper, watercolor paper, wood, steel, concrete and walls. Her works open up a dialogue with painting and sculpture.
Murabito’s aesthetic references the research of photography pioneers like Eadweard Muybridge. Her works try to surpass the boundaries of photography by questioning their relationship to reality. Like R. Hanselle wrote in "fotoMagazin", they are “enchantment and transcendence.”
Exhibitions and collections.
Murabito’s works are displayed at the SpallArt collection in Salzburg, Austria and other international private collections. Her works were exhibited throughout Europe by the Klosterneuburg Monastery, Delizia Estense del Verginese, the Hungarian Academy Rome and the Municipal Museum Rosenheim.

Postal communication in the General Government

Postal communication in the General Government, previously provided by the Polish Post (Poczta Polska), were taken over by the German postal service (Reichspost) after the invasion of Poland and the establishment of the General Government in 1939, and then in 1941 in additional areas of eastern Poland.
The laws and regulations that governed postal communication varied widely, depending on which group an individual belonged to, as well as where the individual was located. Postal communication in the ghettos and concentration camps were especially varied, with many locations having regulations unique to them. Despite postal service being available to all individuals in principle, in practice the ability to send and receive mail was at times either interrupted or totally stopped.
Mail service for Non-German civilians.
Non-Germans, which included ethnic Poles and anyone else considered to be not racially German by the Nazis, saw no restrictions to their postal communications until 1942, at which time several restrictions were introduced. General Governor Hans Frank issued the following restrictions regarding written communications: non-Germans were limited to a maximum of two letters per month, each letter was limited to a maximum of two pages in length (this restriction was not applied to postcards), and communication were only permitted with friendly countries, though in some cases communication with the outside world was available via neutral countries. In addition to these restrictions, an additional regulation was introduced requiring the full name and address of the sender to appear on all pages of the letter to assist with Nazi censorship efforts.
Deutsche Post Osten.
DPO was a German postal service in part of German-occupied Poland known as Generalgouvernement. The Post took over assets of Poczta Polska, Telegraf i Telefon in 1939. The Post employed Germans, Volksdeutsche and Poles. The post used at the beginning both Polish and German stamps with "Deutsche Post Osten" and "Generalgouvernement" overprints, later its own stamps. Its president was Richard Lauxmann.
The Deutsche Post Osten serviced ghettos in GG till 1941. Later Judenrats took over the service.
The DPO has published "Official Phone Book for General Government".
Ghettos.
In the ghettos established by Nazi occupying forces after the invasion of Poland, the duty of setting up a ghetto post office and mail service often fell to the local Judenrat. The administration of the ghettos varied from ghetto to ghetto across the General Government, and so did the availability of mail service within them. While most ghettos did have some postal service, some did not for unknown reasons.
In many ghettos the transfer from a local mail service to one provided by the Judenrat was not immediate. As many cities occupied by the Nazis began to refuse to provide mail service to Jews, the transfer to a systematic process within the ghetto was a gradual process. The post offices established in the ghettos also provided a source of employment for the Jews living within. In Łódź (annected to Reich) the post office employed 139 Jews by December 1940, and in the Warsaw ghetto the two post offices established employed 94 Jews by January 1941.
In the Warsaw ghetto, an agreement regarding the exchange of mail leaving and entering the ghetto was reached and was then applied to all ghettos within the General Government. Adam Czerniakow, the head of the Warsaw Judenrat, and the director of Post Office No. C-I, agreed that the Judenrat would handle all mail within the ghetto (coming in to and leaving) and that the Germans would establish a special post office (Postaustauschstelle) for use in exchanging letters and parcels further on.
The post offices in the ghettos also provided a source of income for the local Judenrat, as these councils were also responsible for other public services within the ghetto. This however was often a point of conflict in the ghettos, as the cost of postage often saw a surcharge raising its price to near double the rate outside the ghettos.
The ghettos, and along with them the mail service within, were often subject to the whims of the German occupiers. As German resettlement and deportation plans intensified following the invasion of the Soviet Union, so too did disruptions and in some places suspensions of the mail service. Stoppages in post also corresponded with intensification of Nazi ideology. For example, in Krakow, the exchange of parcels to and from Jews was suspended for sanitation reasons.
Concentration camps.
Postal communication, while subject to many regulations, was allowed to inmates in the concentration camps. The regulations placed upon those living in the concentration camps were outlined by Theodor Eicke during his time as the commandant of the Dachau concentration camp. Prisoners were only able to write letters on pre-provided postcards within the camps and were forbidden from writing outside the lines of the postcard. Additionally, inmates had to provide their full name, date of birth, and location within the camp in the address. Beyond their given names, inmates were required to identify themselves as Jewish by adding Israel to their name for males, and Sara for females. In addition to these explicit regulations, prisoners were also often obliged to include the line “I am in good health and everything is fine here” in their postcards. For both the senders and responders to these letters, the only acceptable written language was German. After sending, any letters would be subject to strict censorship by both the camp post office, and the High Command of the Wehrmacht (OKW).
Printed on all pre-provided postcards were additional rules regarding the frequency with which letters could be exchanged, as well as what was allowed to be sent along with the letter. These additional rules and regulations are known as Eicke's Regulation and applied to prisoners in all concentration camps. While these regulations would have been intended for use across all camps, their application and enforcement was up to the local SS officials, and as a result were not always implemented uniformly.

Hryhoriy Vasiura

Hryhoriy Mykytovych Vasiura (, ; 15 February 1915 – 2 October 1987) was originally a senior lieutenant in the Red Army who was captured during the Nazi invasion of the USSR in 1941 and subsequently volunteered for service in the "Schutzmannschaft" (the Nazi collaborationist auxiliary police) and the Waffen-SS. Vasiura's wartime activities were not fully revealed until the mid-1980s, when he was convicted as a war criminal by a Soviet military court and executed in 1987 for his role in the Khatyn massacre.
Biography.
Early life and Soviet military.
Vasiura was born on 9 February 1915 (according to other data, in 1913) in the city of Chyhyryn (now Cherkasy Region, Ukraine). He worked as a school teacher before World War II. In 1936, he graduated from the Kiev Military School of Communications.
By the beginning of the Nazi invasion of the USSR in June 1941, Vasiura commanded a communication squad of the 67th Rifle Division (according to data of his war prisoner card, he served in the artillery forces). During the battle of Liepāja on June 28, he was wounded in the thigh and captured.
Vasiura was imprisoned in the camp Stalag III-A. While in captivity he agreed to collaborate with the Germans, and in February 1942 he was sent to the school of propagandists (first in Wustrau, later in Wutzetz) organized within the camp Stalag III-D under the authority of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories.
Service in the ranks of punitive forces.
After graduating from the school of propagandists in October 1942, Vasiura was sent to Kiev, where he joined the 118th Schutzmannschaft battalion composed of former Soviet soldiers and Ukrainian collaborators. Some sources state that along with other members of the unit he took part in executions of Jews in Babi Yar.
Vasiura quickly advanced in the service. From platoon commander, he was promoted to chief of staff over his predecessor in December 1942. The unit had a double leadership: German Major Erich Körner was in charge, while Vasiura supervised the battalion on a daily basis. That same month, the unit was transferred to the occupied Belorussian SSR to conduct punitive operations against partisans. The battalion first arrived at Minsk, and then deployed to the town of Pleshchenitsy.
From January 1943 to July 1944, Vasiura and his battalion conducted dozens of pacification actions – including operations "Hornung", "Draufgänger", "Cottbus", "Hermann" and "Wandsbeck" – that were part of the "dead zone" policy of annihilating hundreds of Belarusian villages in order to remove the support base for the alleged partisans. 60 major and 80 smaller actions affected 627 villages across occupied Belarus.
Khatyn massacre.
On the morning of 22 March 1943, three vehicles with the 118th battalion staff were ambushed by "Uncle Vasya's" partisan squad near the village of Khatyn. Partisans killed Hans Woellke, the hauptmann (captain) of the auxiliary police and commander of the first battalion's company, who was on his way to the Minsk airport. He was well known as the shot-put champion of the 1936 Olympics. Hitler knew him personally.
Woellke's death enraged the policemen, who suspected local peasants of helping the partisans. On the Pleshchenitsy–Logoysk road they stopped 50 inhabitants of the village of Kozyri, and killed 26 of them. Soon the 118th battalion and SS-Sturmbrigade Dirlewanger surrounded the village of Khatyn.
Following Körner's orders, the soldiers under Vasiura's direction forced the peasants into a barn which they set on fire. They shot everybody who tried to escape. In total, 149 people died (including 75 children).
Later war crimes in Belarus.
Vasiura continued serving in the 118th battalion in Belarus.
On 13 May 1943 he commanded a unit in a battle against partisans for the village of Dalkovichi, and on May 27, his battalion executed 78 people in the village of Osovi. Then, within the punitive operation "Cottbus", the unit massacred residents of the village of Vileika and its suburbs. Afterwards they burned the villages of Makovie and Uborok, where nobody was left alive, and then executed 50 Jews in the village of Kaminska Sloboda.
Vasiura later transferred to the 76th Waffen Grenadier Regiment of the 30th Grenadier SS-Division, where he fought until the end of the war. Supposedly, his regiment was smashed in France, where some part of the 118th Schutzmannschaft battalion went over to French partisans.
Körner hid the civilian deaths, reporting to his superiors that the 118th battalion fought only against numerous partisan squads. This was due to the decree, issued on 18 November 1942, that forbade involving locals in criminal liability because many villages were "under partisans' oppression".
Post-war times.
While at the Soviet filtration camp, Vasiura hid the fact of his service in the auxiliary police and SS. In 1952, the Kiev Military Tribunal sentenced him to 25 years imprisonment, but on 17 September 1955 he was amnestied in accordance with a decree issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Usually, Vasiura explained his post-war imprisonment by the fact that he had previously been taken prisoner by the Germans, and obtained an official certificate confirming this.
Vasiura moved to the village Velyka Dymerka (Brovary District, Kyiv Region) and became the economic director of the Velikodymersky state farm. The farm was quite successful under his leadership. However, farm-workers sometimes complained about Vasiura's heavy-handed management as he would cruelly beat the employees. He built a big house, was encouraged several times for conscientious work, and received a membership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). In 1984, he was awarded the medal Veteran of Labour. He married, and two of his daughters were school teachers.
Vasiuta became an honorary cadet of the Kiev Military School of Communications. He would give patriotic speeches in front of cadets and pioneers, making reference to his fictional battle feats, pretending that he was a Red Army veteran.
Detention and trial.
In 1985, Vasiura demanded the Order of the Patriotic War as a veteran. In the archives, employees found only the fact that he went missing in June 1941. Further searches in the archives forced them to review some results of the interrogation of Vasyl Meleshko, Vasiura's former fellow soldier, who was executed in 1975 for collaboration with the Nazis and participation in the burning of Khatyn. A criminal case was opened "due to the newly discovered circumstances". In November 1986, Vasiura was arrested and transferred to Minsk.
With almost no survivors of the Khatyn massacre, the 26 witnesses were former soldiers of the 118th Schutzmannschaft battalion, most of whom had already served their sentences in Soviet camps and prisons.
Vasiura initially denied his guilt; he claimed that he did not participate in the punitive operation and did not kill any civilians. But the witnesses all testified that Vasiura gave them orders to kill the villagers. Transcripts of the court case totaled 14 volumes, and the investigators managed to reconstruct the events of 22 March 1943, with accuracy to the minute. Irrefutable evidence of his participation in these military crimes, particularly in the episode at Khatyn, was found.
When Vasiura realized that there was no point denying it, he confessed, shouting, "Yes, I burned your Khatyn!" On 26 December 1986 the Tribunal of the Belorussian Military District, headed by Judge Viktor Glazkov, sentenced Vasiura to death by shooting. He was executed on 2 October 1987.
The trial was not public; only two correspondents – of the newspaper "Izvestiya" and the agency BelTA – were assigned to report on it. They completed their articles but were later informed that the materials would not be published. Glazkov claimed that this happened due to the direct involvement of the general secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party, Volodymyr Shcherbytsky, and the Belorussian Communist Party First Secretary Mikalai Sliunkov. Both were concerned that a public trial of a Ukrainian war criminal would undermine the official discourse of the brotherhood between Soviet peoples.
Vasiura was buried in a forest near Logoysk, in the same place where many of his victims lay. There are papers in the archives which contain the coordinates of the place where his body was buried. He has no grave marker.
The Belarusian government declassified the records of the trial in March 2008.

Virginia Holsinger

Virginia H. Holsinger (March 13, 1937 – September 4, 2009) was a food scientist whose research was significant in the dairy industry. Her research on enzymes as dietary supplements and food treatments was critical to the development of Lactaid and Beano.
Early life and education.
Holsinger was born in Washington, D.C., on March 13, 1937. In 1958, she graduated from the College of William and Mary with a bachelor's degree in chemistry. Afterwards, she joined the Agricultural Research Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), initially working as an analytical chemist at the Agricultural Research Service Dairy Products Laboratory in Washington, D.C. She later attended the Ohio State University where she completed her doctorate in food science and nutrition in 1980 under the direction of Professor Paul M. T. Hansen. Her dissertation was entitled "A Study of the Rehydration Properties of a Milk Analogue Containing Soy Products and Cheese Whey".
Scientific career.
Holsinger specialized in dairy products for the duration of her scientific career. She transferred to USDA's Eastern Regional Research Center in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania, in 1974, at which time she led research programs on the basic science and technology of dairy foods for the duration of her career until her retirement in 1999.
Dietary products.
In the early 1980s, Alan Kligerman, who was one of the owners of a family dairy farm, approached Holsinger about the possibility for developing a milk substitute for people who are lactose intolerant. Lactose intolerance is a common condition worldwide. Holsinger subsequently determined that milk could be treated with a lactase enzyme in order to break down the lactose into simple, easily digestible sugars, in particular, glucose and galactose. For this purpose, Holsinger used a lactase derived from fungi. Most lactose intolerant people could digest milk treated in this way without experiencing the symptoms of lactose intolerance. These findings led to Kligerman's commercialization of the Lactaid brand of lactase-treated dairy products.
Following the success of Lactaid, the U.S. Military approached Holsinger about developing a product designed for soldiers who were lactose intolerant, with the additional requirement that the product be made from dehydrated milk powder. The basis of the additional requirement was that the milk could be reconstituted by soldiers while they were in the field. Holsinger worked with the team that helped her develop Lactaid and successfully developed a lactose free dehydrated milk powder that had long shelf life while retaining good flavor.
Holsinger's conducted fundamental research on the ability of the enzyme α-galactosidase to convert complex sugars into simple sugars. The simple sugars are more easily digested by the human digestive tract. Her findings were put to use by Kligerman's company to develop Beano, which is a digestive aid to prevent formation of human intestinal gas.
Holsinger's work and research was also used to develop reduced-fat mozzarella cheese which was widely adapted in school lunch programs. Holsinger formulated a powder drink mix based on whey and soy drink mix that can be reconstituted with water to provide a milk substitute. This formulation was widely used in emergency relief situations as part of the U.S. Agency for International Development's Food for Peace program.
Awards and honors.
In 1995, Holsinger received the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) Lifetime Achievement Award, granted by the Agricultural Research Service. The award citation stated that this was "for over 20 years of accomplishment in dairy product research and for aiding the advancement of other women in the fields of science and engineering."
A year after Holsinger's 1999 retirement as the leader of the Dairy Products Research Unit, she was inducted into the Agricultural Research Service's Hall of Fame for lifetime career achievements.
In 1986, Holsinger received the Distinguished Service Award of the American Chemical Society's Division of Agricultural &amp; Food Chemistry. Holsinger was an emeritus member of the American Chemical Society, having been a member of the organization since 1959.
Holsinger and the rest of the team that developed Lactaid received the Food Technology Industrial Achievement Award by the Institute of Food Technologists in 1987.
Representative publications.
Holsinger published more than 100 scientific papers in scholarly journals. Representative examples:
Death.
Holsinger died on September 4, 2009, from breast cancer at the age of 72, in Fairfax, Virginia. Holsinger maintained a home in northern Virginia, near where her brother Gordon Holsinger lived, keeping this home even during the time she was working at the USDA facility in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania. Her brother Gordon Holsinger was her sole survivor at the time of her death.

Ionideios Model High School of Piraeus

Ionideios (or Ionidios) School of Piraeus ( ) is a school in Piraeus, Greece. It was founded in 1847, and it was named after the Greek national benefactor Constantine Ionides (Greek: Κωνσταντίνος Ιωνίδης), father of Alexander Constantine Ionides.
History.
Ionideios was established in 1847. However, its history began in 1844, when Petros Omiridis Skylitsis, the Mayor of Piraeus at the time, addressed Konstantinos Ionidis by letter and asked for help in setting up schools in Piraeus. In his reply to the mayor, Constantinos Ionides stated that he would provide 30,000 drachmas, an amount of great importance at the time, provided that the Municipality of Piraeus would purchase the land pay for the future cost of the school in order to function. In 1845 the City Council accepted these terms together with some others that the donor had set.
Two years later, in 1847 and on the mayoralty of Dimitrios Theocharis, the construction of the school began and on 21 May of the same year while the donor provided 10,000 drachmas more for the needs of the school and the creation of a library. In 1862, the establishment of the Gymnasium was signed by the then Minister of Education. Until 1914 the school housed the only Gymnasium in Piraeus. This year, with the foundation of the Second Gymnasium in the city of Piraeus, Ionides renamed the school to First Gymnasium. The Gymnasium operated in the original building of 1847 until 1932, when it was demolished, in order to erect in its place the building in which it is housed today. In 1963, the Minister of Education, Grigorios Kasimatis renames the school to Ionideios Model School of Piraeus. Since 1986 the official name is set to be "Model Gymnasium and Lyceum of Ionideios" and it is usually referred to as "Ionideios High School of Piraeus".
Enrollment.
Every year the Greek Μinistry of Εducation organises exams for the 17 model schools of Greece,one of which is Ionideios. Students apply for a place in one of these 17 schools and the highest scoring ones are accepted. Ionideios accepts 108 students each year. In 2020, 325 students applied. In case a student leaves the school for any reason before their graduation a special exam is organised in order to fill his position.
Facilities.
The building of the School is located on the western side of the building square that is formed by Korai Square, Iroon Polytechniou str. and Sotiros Dios str., in the center of Piraeus. Students and teachers use the entrance of 17, Sotiros Dios Street.
On the ground floor are the concierge, the canteen, the Event Hall and the Gymnasium's Computer Laboratory.
On the first floor is the courtyard, indoor gymnasium, the Chemistry Lab, 4 classrooms, which are used by the first grade of Lyceum, the Multimedia Lab and the Library.
On the second floor are the offices of the Directors, the Deputy Directors, the Secretariats and the Office of the Teachers, four classes of teaching, which are used by the 2nd grade of Lyceum, as well as the Physics and Biology Laboratories.
On the third floor there are twelve classrooms, which are used by the entire Gymnasium as well as another computer lab.
On the fourth floor, there are four classrooms, which are used by the Third Grade of Lyceum, as well as a robotics lab.
More than half of the rooms are equipped with interactive whiteboards.
Library.
At Ionideios there is a library from the first years of its foundation, which is one of the largest School Libraries in Greece. It has an area of 90 sqm and contains 24 bookshelves.
The library houses 2 collections, the old collection of Ioneidos and the newest one. The old collection lists 5,556 titles, according to the latest census of 1999, when the new School Library was funded under the EU's 2nd Community Support Framework. At that time the old collection was enriched with 4,600 titles and audiovisual material. The new library is continuously enriched with new material and to date it contains over 13,000 books and audiovisual material as well as magazines of varied content. In addition, electronic book search can be done through ABEKT's electronic automation system at the National Documentation Centre.
All library material is classified with the US DEWEY decimal system and is managed through the ABEKT system.
Computer Laboratories.
The Gymnasium's computer laboratory is located on the ground floor of the building and is equipped with a network of 12 workstations connected to a central computer. The Multimedia Hall, on the first floor, is a multi-purpose lab. In it take place the computer courses of Lyceum, as well as the lessons of other Lyceum courses.

Isaac D. Hamilton

Isaac D. Hamilton (1804-1859) was a Texas Revolutionary soldier and survivor of the Goliad Massacre. A native of Alabama, Hamilton joined Dr. Jack Shackelford's Red Rovers in 1835 and fought in the Battle of Coleto where he was badly wounded. Hamilton escaped the massacre of 425 men on March 27, 1836, along with three other members of the Red Rovers, including Dillard Cooper. Hamilton's wounds made travel painful and slow and, at his own insistence, the other three left him behind. Hamilton was recaptured and was in transit to be executed when two Mexican women helped him make his escape. He linked back up with Texian forces and eventually made his way back to Alabama.
Hamilton would spend the next two decades attempting to gain title to a league of land (4,428.4 acres) that had been promised Texas Revolutionaries for their service, first from the Republic of Texas then from the State of Texas. Hamiliton was finally granted land near present day Beaumont but, having never recovered fully from his wounds, died after making the trip to Texas before the land could even be surveyed. He is buried in the Old Moulton Cemetery in Moulton, Lavaca County, Texas.

Phytophthora hydropathica

Phytophthora hydropathica is an oomycete plant pathogen that is found in aquatic environments such as irrigation and river water. The pathogen was previously classified as "P. drechsleri" Dre II before being categorized as its own distinct species. "P. hydropathica" has been primarily found in association with ornamental plant nurseries. The pathogen has been isolated throughout the Southern United States, as well as internationally in Mexico, Italy, and Spain.
Etymology.
The species name "hydropathica" is composed of the word elements "hydro", meaning "water" and "pathica", referring to the pathogenicity.
Hosts and symptoms.
"P. hydropathica" has been shown to naturally infect a number of different plants including Catawba rhododendron, English Roseum rhododendron, mountain laurel, and "Laurustinus" trees. Studies have shown that the pathogen has the ability to infect other hosts when introduced, such as alder, carnations, cucumber, azaleas, dusty miller, tomato, and pepper. Symptoms of infection vary with host type.
Disease cycle.
"P. hydropathica" is a heterothallic oomycete, meaning that both mating types need to be present in order to sexually reproduce. The A1 mating type has been reported to be highly represented in populations. The species produce plerotic oospores and round antheridia, with observations of the sexual bodies being golden in color. Nonpapillate and noncaducous sporangia are produced, with varying shapes (obpyriform, ovoid, and nearly spherical), and are able to release zoospores. Zoospore release time has been recorded to vary, from release happening immediately after sporangia formation or within hours. Some isolates do not show the ability to produce zoospores. "P. hydropathica" does produce chlamydospores, present at the end of long hyphae and on short pedicels. Hyphal swelling has also been observed.
Environment.
"P. hydropathica" is most commonly found in sources of water, such as reserve water ponds, irrigation systems, and rivers. The optimal temperature for growth in the lab is . In irrigation reservoirs in Mississippi and Alabama the pathogen has the highest counts in the month of May, and has also been shown to have high recovery rates in hot summer temperatures. In the U.S. isolates have been recovered in Alabama, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Samples have also been isolated in Italy, Spain, and Mexico.

Hippichthys spicifer

Hippichthys spicifer, commonly known as bellybarred pipefish, banded freshwater pipefish, or blue spotted pipefish, is a species of pipefish of the family Syngnathidae. It is found in the Indo-Pacific, from the Red Sea and East Africa to Sri Lanka and Samoa. It lives in shallow coastal and estuarine habitats such as mangroves, tidal creeks, and the lower reaches of rivers, where it can grow to lengths of . It is expected to feed on small crustaceans and mosquito larvae. This species is ovoviviparous, with males brooding eggs in a brood pouch before giving birth to live young. It is reproductively active all year, with males and females reaching sexual maturity at respectively. Brood size can vary significantly, from 114 to 1764, with an average of 604.4 plus or minus 322.8.
Identification.
"H. spicifer" has a brownish to red back, a bluish stomach, and fine brown and pale mottling. The underside of the front of the body usually has a series of brown to blue bars interspersed with yellow to white bars. The lower part of the head usually has black dots.

Judith S. Olson

Judith S. Olson is an American researcher best known for her work in the field of human-computer interaction and the effect of distance on teamwork. 
Olson began her career at the University of Michigan before later moving to the University of California, Irvine. She retired in 2008 with over 110 research articles to her name.
Education.
In 1965, Judith Olson received her B.A. in Mathematics and Psychology from Northwestern University. In 1969, she received her Ph.D. in Mathematical Psychology at the University of Michigan. Following the completion of her Ph.D., she attended Stanford University in 1970 as a Postdoctoral Fellow in Cognitive Psychology.
Life and career.
From 1970 to 2008, Olson taught at the University of Michigan as a professor in both the Department of Psychology and in the Computer and Information Systems Group. She retired in 2008 from the University of Michigan, where she was made a Professor Emerita for her contributions to the field of Human Computer Interaction. Currently, Olson serves as a Bren Professor of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine. Her husband, Gary M. Olson, was also a Bren Professor of Information and Computer Sciences at UCI before retiring in 2016 and is a frequent co-author of her research works.
Research and Publications.
Olson has published over 110 research articles, primarily focusing on the field of Human Computer Interaction and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work. She has also contributed to several textbooks on collaboration and distance, the most recent of which include "Scientific Collaboration on the Internet" (2008), "Working Together Apart" (2014), and "Enhancing the Effectiveness of Team Science" (2015).
Her most cited paper, “Distance Matters” (Olson &amp; Olson, 2000), studied the effects of geographic distance on teamwork and communication. Analyzing more than a decade's worth of remote and in-person group collaboration, they found that remotely-located team members had difficulty establishing the same context, or what the researchers dubbed “common ground,” when posing questions to one another. Furthermore, collaborative efforts were hindered by a lack of willingness to learn the technology and a lack of incentive to share personal discoveries with remote coworkers. Her involvement in the study of Virtual Teams builds upon the findings in “Distance Matters,” and aims to provide remote work teams with the “tools, methods, and processes” to successfully collaborate regardless of physical distance.
Olson's interests also span the field of education, where she is researching the role that telepresence robots play in reducing the social and educational barrier chronically ill or disabled children face when they are kept from school and classmates for extended periods of time. To this end, Olson is currently working on learning the effectiveness of iPads as a videoconferencing bridge between a child at home and his or her school so that they can remotely attend class discussions, lectures, and socialize with friends. She works with students and faculty from UCI to build and maintain AuthorViz and DocuViz, tools for visualizing author and revision histories in Google Docs, respectively.

YouTube headquarters shooting

On April 3, 2018, at around 12:46 p.m. PDT, a shooting occurred at the headquarters of the video-sharing website YouTube in San Bruno, California. The shooter was identified as 38-year-old Nasim Najafi Aghdam, who entered through an exterior parking garage, approached an outdoor patio, and opened fire with a Smith &amp; Wesson 9 mm semi-automatic pistol. Aghdam wounded three people, one of them critically, before killing herself.
Shooting.
At 12:46 p.m., San Bruno police received reports of a shooter at the YouTube headquarters. Aghdam's weapon had a capacity of 10 rounds and she emptied one magazine before reloading. Helicopter footage later showed a large hole and broken glass in the building's lobby doors. A coroner's report found that Aghdam died of a self-inflicted gunshot to the heart, finding no evidence of drugs or alcohol in her system. The shooting happened two days before Aghdam's 39th birthday.
Perpetrator.
Background.
The perpetrator was identified by police as Nasim Najafi Aghdam (; 5 April 1979 – 3 April 2018), a vegan activist and fitness personality of Iranian-Azerbaijani heritage. She was born in Urmia, Iran, her parents immigrated to Iran from the Republic of Azerbaijan. She immigrated to the United States with her family in 1996. She was a registered member of the Baháʼí Faith and described how veganism was aligned with her religion, but was critical of Muslims and Baháʼís who ate animals. She lived with her grandmother in Riverside County, California. She posted content on Facebook, Instagram, Telegram and YouTube in Persian, Azerbaijani, English and Turkish. Her content went viral on Iranian social media and drew widespread attention. She had previously protested with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) against the use of pigs in United States Marine Corps training procedures for victims of trauma.
Nasim Aghdam purchased and registered a 9 mm Smith &amp; Wesson semi-automatic pistol from The Gun Range San Diego, a gun dealer, on January 16, 2018. On March 31, 2018, Aghdam's family reported to the police that Nasim Aghdam was missing. According to her father, she "hated" YouTube, and the family was worried she might be traveling to the company's offices.
The morning before the shooting, police officers found Aghdam sleeping in her car in a Walmart parking lot in Mountain View, south of YouTube's headquarters. The officers did not identify her as a threat, and it is unclear whether these police officers were aware of the concerns of Aghdam's father. Aghdam visited a shooting range the day before the shooting.
Motive.
Police believe Aghdam was motivated by perceived discrimination by YouTube towards her channels. She complained about the company on her website, writing that "Youtube filtered my channels to keep them from getting views!" and that the company had demonetized most of her videos.
Ismail Aghdam, her father, of Riverside County, said that his daughter was a "vegan activist and animal lover" who told him that YouTube had been censoring her videos and stopped paying her for her content. "She was angry," he said. According to the "San Jose Mercury-News":[Nasim] Aghdam was prolific on social media, posting videos and photos on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube. Her YouTube channel included strange workout video clips, graphic animal abuse videos and vegan cooking tutorials.
Victims.
San Francisco General Hospital and Stanford University Medical Center treated the victims. Four injuries were reported. The victims were a 36-year-old man in critical condition, a 32-year-old woman in fair condition, and a 27-year-old woman in stable condition. Another person injured her ankle while fleeing the building.
Reactions.
U.S. President Donald Trump was briefed on the shooting and tweeted, "Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene." Other notable politicians who tweeted their condolences include Vice President Mike Pence, then Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senator Dianne Feinstein.
YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki wrote on Twitter: "There are no words to describe how horrible it was to have an active shooter @YouTube today. Our deepest gratitude to law enforcement &amp; first responders for their rapid response. Our hearts go out to all those injured &amp; impacted today. We will come together to heal as a family." Google CEO Sundar Pichai echoed these sentiments on Twitter, and sent an email to his employees describing the shooting as an "unimaginable tragedy" and a "horrific act of violence." Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos, the CEOs of Apple and Amazon respectively, also offered their condolences. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, and Box CEO Aaron Levie called for stricter gun control legislation.
The Baháʼí National Center condemned the shooting by Aghdam and extended condolences to individuals hurt by this event.

History of Maryland Terrapins football

The Maryland Terrapins football team represents the University of Maryland, College Park in the sport of American football. The Terrapins compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and the Big Ten Conference. The Terrapins joined the Big Ten Conference on July 1, 2014, following 62 years in the Atlantic Coast Conference as a founding member. The Terrapins are currently coached by Mike Locksley. Since 1950, the Terrapins have played their home games at Maryland Stadium in College Park, Maryland with occasional home games from time to time in Baltimore, making them one of two FBS football teams in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area (Navy Midshipmen) and the closest Football Bowl Subdivision team to Washington, D.C. The team's official colors of red, white, black, and gold have been in use in some combination since the 1920s and are taken from Maryland's state flag, and the Terrapins nickname — often abbreviated as "Terps" — was adopted in 1933 after a turtle species native to the state.
Early history (1892–1946).
In 1892, the school then known as the Maryland Agricultural College fielded its first officially sanctioned college football team. They went scoreless in all three of that season's games, but the following year, posted a perfect record of 6–0. For the first two decades of the program, the team primarily competed against local universities and high schools due to the prohibitive nature of long-distance travel at the time.
In 1911, Harry C. "Curley" Byrd became head coach and held that position for more than two decades until he was named the university president. In 1921, Maryland joined the Southern Conference where it remained for thirty years. Between 1935 and 1946, the school had several coaches that achieved fame elsewhere: Frank Dobson, a former assistant coach under John Heisman; Clark Shaughnessy, architect of Stanford's undefeated 1940 turnaround; and Paul "Bear" Bryant, who later became the long-time Alabama head coach. Bryant resigned after one season when a player he had suspended was reinstated by President Byrd.
Jim Tatum (1947–1955).
Jim Tatum was hired in 1947, after a brief stint at Oklahoma where he had led the Sooners to a conference championship in his only season there. He was Maryland's sixth head coach in eight years, but Tatum stayed for nine seasons and became the school's most successful head coach in modern history. During his tenure, he led Maryland to two national championships (one retroactive), three conference championships, three perfect seasons, six top-20 final rankings, and five bowl game appearances. Seven of his players were named first-team All-Americans, including five consensus All-Americans. Under Tatum, Maryland finished every season with a winning record.
After the 1947 season, the Terrapins participated in their first bowl game, the 1948 Gator Bowl, in which they tied Georgia, 20–20. NCAA season-scoring leader Lu Gambino recorded all three Maryland touchdowns. In 1949, Maryland again played in the Gator Bowl, where they defeated 20th-ranked Missouri, 20–7. The Terrapins finished the season ranked 14th by the Associated Press. Maryland's current home field, Maryland Stadium, was constructed in 1950, and named in honor of former coach and contemporary Maryland president Curly Byrd. Maryland started the 1950 season ranked 15th and defeated Navy, 35–21, in the Byrd Stadium dedication game.
The Terrapins won the 1951 Southern Conference co-championship alongside the Virginia Military Institute. Their perfect season culminated with an upset over first-ranked Tennessee in the Sugar Bowl. At the time, however, the wire services released their final rankings before the bowl games, and Maryland finished third in the Associated Press Poll. Several selectors, including analyst Jeff Sagarin, have retroactively credited Maryland with the national championship. In 1953, Maryland and six other schools split from the Southern Conference to form the Atlantic Coast Conference. That year, Maryland shut-out two 11th-ranked teams: Mississippi, 38–0, and Alabama, 21–0, won the ACC co-championship alongside Duke, and were named the national champions as the only undefeated and untied team in the nation. The Terrapins were defeated by fourth-ranked Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl. After the 1955 season, Tatum resigned to return to North Carolina, where he soon died of Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
Tommy Mont (1956–1958).
After Tatum resigned to coach at his own alma mater, North Carolina, Tommy Mont was appointed as his replacement. In his first season, Maryland was riddled with injuries and posted a disappointing 2–7–1 record. Mont had great difficulty recruiting to the same standard that his predecessor had, but managed to secure Rod Breedlove, a highly touted guard prospect. Breedlove later went on to play eight years in the NFL and made a Pro Bowl appearance.
In 1957, the Terrapins improved to a 5–5 record. The highlight of the season was a game featuring Jim Tatum's return to College Park, Maryland. On October 19, at Byrd Stadium, Maryland met the North Carolina team led by their former head coach. The game also had in attendance Queen Elizabeth II who had expressed a wish to see her first game of American football. The Tar Heels were ranked 6th in the nation and possessed a 3–1 record. The Terrapins, on the other hand, were 1–3. In the first quarter, Maryland halfback Howard Dare fumbled and North Carolina linebacker Jack Lineberger recovered the ball on the Terrapins' 44-yard line. North Carolina was subsequently forced to punt, but recovered it at the Maryland 35. On the ensuing possession, Tar Heel halfback Daley Goff rushed 11 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter, Maryland gained excellent field position when Goff received a bad punt snap and the Terps took over on the Carolina 38-yard line. Maryland quarterback Bob Rusevlyan later scored on a one-yard sneak. In the fourth quarter, halfback Ted Kershner broke away for an 81-yard touchdown run. Fullback Jim Joyce capped a 67-yard drive with a 13-yard rush for a score. With a final result of 21–7, the Maryland players carried Mont to the Queen and Prince Philip's box. Mont said it was a day that "I will revel in for the rest of my life."
In 1958, however, Maryland again backslided with a 4–6 record and Mont subsequently resigned.
Tom Nugent (1959–1965).
At the first practice before the 1959 season, new Terps head football coach Tom Nugent addressed his team, "Hi, I'm Tom Nugent and I hate West Virginia." The Mountaineers were Maryland's first opponent of the season, and Nugent guided the Terrapins to a 27–7 victory in that game.
In 1961, Nugent's Maryland team became the first college football program in the nation to put players' names on the back of their jerseys. That season, he led the Terrapins to the best season of his tenure and finished with a 7–3 record. The Terrapins also defeated seventh-ranked Syracuse, 22–21.
Nugent amassed a 36–34 record during his tenure at Maryland. He remained the last Maryland coach to win his inaugural game with the team until Ralph Friedgen matched that feat in 2001.
Under Nugent, in 1962, Maryland integrated its football team after Darryl Hill caught the eye of Maryland assistant coach Lee Corso. who had been encouraged by Nugent to find a black athlete to play for his team. Hill became not only the first African-American football player at Maryland but the first in the Atlantic Coast Conference and at any college or university in "the old South."
Lou Saban (1966).
In a surprising move, Lou Saban unexpectedly resigned as head coach of the AFL's Buffalo Bills in January 1966 to the head football coach position at Maryland. He said he was leaving because "there can be little left to conquer in professional football". His record at Buffalo was 36–17–3. Saban, however, only stayed at Maryland for one season in which the team posted a 4–6 record, as he departed back to the AFL to become head coach of the Denver Broncos.
Bob Ward (1967–1968).
In 1967, Bob Ward returned to his alma mater to take the head coaching position. Before the season, 12 players failed to academically qualify to play on the team. During that first season, the team lost all nine of their games for the first time in the modern era. Ward's second year saw slight improvement, recording eight losses but with wins over North Carolina and South Carolina. However, many of his players were growing increasingly disgruntled with his coaching style.
In March 1969, Maryland athletic director Jim Kehoe called a meeting among 120 players, Ward, his assistants, and a three-man committee. Thirty-one of those players told Ward that they no longer wished to play for the Terrapins and accused him of using intimidation tactics, including verbal and physical abuse. Ward listened to the player's grievances, but did not respond at the time. Two days later, he resigned as head coach. Later that year, "Sports Illustrated" interviewed Ward, and he said:"I won't go into all the specifics, but it wasn't the good players who started it. It was the guys who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag, guys who sat on the bench and couldn't take it and a couple of pip-squeak cub newspaper guys who don't know what football's all about ... He gets on the campus newspaper and all of a sudden he's got power he never thought of having."
"The Diamondback", the university's student newspaper, had criticized Ward for moving the team into one dormitory, which forced some other students out. Ward stated that the move was done on the advice of Kehoe—which Kehoe denied—and with the intent of focusing the players on their studies and building camaraderie. Ward and his assistants monitored the players' academic performance, enforced class attendance, and placed curfews on perceived troublemakers. Ward stated that, in his first year, only two of his players failed out of the school that he claimed had a history of poor athlete academics. He complained that he was a scapegoat and that there had been poor communication between him and Kehoe. In fact, Penn State head coach Joe Paterno was concerned with the situation surrounding Ward's resignation and sent a letter to the American Football Coaches Association demanding an investigation. Paterno said:"I don't know who's right or wrong, but ... I don't think it's a good thing for a squad to fire a coach. As an association, we ought to know what happened. If a university fired an English professor because his class didn't like the way he was doing things, I know darn well that the American Association of University Professors would want to know what happened."
Roy Lester (1969–1971).
In 1969, Roy Lester was hired as Maryland's fourth head coach in five years.
Lester had previously twice applied for the Maryland head coach position, but didn't get it. The "Daytona Beach Morning Journal" speculated that Lester's undisclosed salary probably matched that of Ward: $20,000.
Lester reintroduced the split-T formation at Maryland, which Jim Tatum had used to great effect there in the 1950s.
Lester's philosophy was explained by the Maryland sports information director Jack Zane: "the pass should open up the defense for the running game."In the sixth game of his first season, Maryland's starting quarterback, junior Dennis O'Hara, was injured in a loss at South Carolina, and was replaced by sophomore Jeff Shugars.
In the season's penultimate game, Maryland lost to Penn State, 48–0. Penn State halfback Lydell Mitchell had been recruited by Lester and originally intended to go to Maryland before he opted for Penn State instead. Lester was bothered by a similar situation with fullback Franco Harris, whose high school coach was a friend of Lester's. Lester attributed Maryland's football woes to the turnover at head coach and lack of depth because of recruitment shortcomings. Maryland won the finale against Virginia to finish the season with a 3–7 record.
In 1970, Lester's Terrapins finished with a 2–9 record. After an upset loss in the season opener against Villanova, 21–3, Lester shuffled the roster. He switched the positions of eight players, which included Tom Miller from fullback to linebacker.The season prior, Miller had gained 629 yards, the second-most ever by a Maryland sophomore.
After losing their first five games, Maryland beat South Carolina on Homecoming weekend, 21–15, which prompted Maryland fans to tear down the goalposts in celebration. In the 25-mile per hour winds, the Terrapins capitalized on the Gamecocks' poor punting game, which included one blocked punt.
Two weeks later, Maryland was beaten by Clemson, which scored 21 points in the fourth quarter to win, 24–11.
With the loss, Maryland slid to a 1–7 record, and Lester said he was giving serious consideration to stepping down before the next season. He said, "If I'm not doing the proper job I'm willing to relinquish the job. I took this loss very personally."
In 1971, some observers considered Maryland, which returned 37 lettermen, to be the dark horse in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Lester said he expected a winning season and that "a lot of people may be surprised."
However, the Terrapins dropped the season opener to underdog Villanova once again, 28–13."Star-News" called it the most stunning of five upsets in the ACC teams' opening weekend, rating it ahead of NC State's loss to Kent State, Virginia's loss to Navy, South Carolina's win against Georgia Tech, and Duke's win against Florida.Maryland won the following week against NC State, but then dropped five straight before beating the Virginia Military Institute on Homecoming. Maryland closed the season with losses to Penn State, Clemson, and Virginia to again finish with a 2–9 record.Lester was fired at the conclusion of the 1971 season. Athletic director Jim Kehoe cited Maryland's worst record in the ACC for two consecutive years and stated his goal of making Maryland a "nationally ranked caliber" team.
Kehoe also said, "financial factors are a serious consideration", and that home game attendance had fallen to its lowest point, which threatened the financial well-being of the athletic department. Lester was replaced by Jerry Claiborne, who later went on to considerable success in the position.
In September 1973, Maryland All-American guard Paul Vellano, then playing under Claiborne, said of the past coaches' difficulties: "A lot of the kids said that Ward was a good coach but that he had a lot of bad apples. Lester was a high school coach and nobody had ever heard of him. I can't understand it. We had nine freshman who were All-Americans my first year here under Lester. Maybe if they had let him stay he could have done the job.
One of Lester's lasting contributions was the recruitment of future Maryland and NFL star Randy White.
At the end of his tenure, Lester had a combined collegiate coaching record of 7–25.
Jerry Claiborne (1972–1981).
In 1972, Jerry Claiborne took over as head coach of the Terrapins, which had only nine wins in the past five years. In his first season, Maryland improved to 5–5–1, and the following year, they reached their first bowl game in almost two decades. The team steadily improved until his fifth season, 1976, when they finished the regular season with an 11–0 record, their first perfect mark since Tatum's 1955 squad. Boomer Esiason later described Claiborne's coaching style as "vanilla", and said his strategy was "run right, run left, run up the middle, punt, and play good defense." He went on to say, "But, there's no question he made me a tougher player . . . We'd do drills where the quarterback had to take on a linebacker. It was like he had a sign on our back, 'Hit us, we're stupid'. It made you a tougher player."
In 1974, Maryland had a preseason rank of 14th and later beat 17th-ranked NC State to win the ACC championship. The Terrapins were defeated by 20th-ranked Tennessee in the Liberty Bowl and finished the season ranked 13th. In 1975, Maryland again won the ACC and defeated 13th-ranked Florida in the Gator Bowl to finish 13th in the nation. That season, the Terrapins led the ACC in total offense with 375.2 yards per game. Maryland started 1976 ranked 12th, and quarterback Mark Manges led them to eleven consecutive wins to secure their third straight ACC championship. Maryland's loss to sixth-ranked Houston in the Cotton Bowl Classic, 30–21, ended any hopes for a national championship.
In 1978, Maryland beat 20th-ranked NC State and finished with a ranking of 20th. The game that pitted 11th-ranked Maryland against 12th-ranked Clemson has been described as one of the most exciting games of the era. The "big-play caravan" ultimately saw Clemson triumph, 28–24. From 1974 to 1978, Claiborne and the Terrapins secured five consecutive bowl game berths and three consecutive ACC championships. Maryland made it to a sixth bowl game in 1980. After the 1981 season, Claiborne left the program for his alma mater, Kentucky, and was replaced by Bobby Ross, an assistant coach for the Kansas City Chiefs.
Bobby Ross (1982–1986).
In a surprising choice, former Maryland assistant coach and Citadel head coach Bobby Ross, who was not a big name at the time, was selected as head coach in 1982. In contrast to Claiborne's style, Ross implemented a high-powered offense. He replaced the I-veer triple option with an NFL-style offense that emphasized dropback passes, bootlegs, and play action passes. This change in tactics and strategy enabled starting quarterback Boomer Esiason the opportunity to excel to a degree not seen under Claiborne the season prior. Esiason said, "Ross has an uncanny knack of putting players in a position to not only succeed, but to overachieve . . . If he didn't show up at Maryland, I don't know what would have happened to me. I don't know if I would have turned into the player I was and played in the NFL." In the following years, several Maryland quarterbacks went on to careers in the National Football League (NFL), and the school was nicknamed "Quarterback U" as a result.
In Ross's inaugural season, Maryland defeated 10th-ranked North Carolina, and then edged Miami before their most important conference game of the season against the 1981 national champions, the Clemson Tigers. Between 1974 and 1988, either Clemson or Maryland won the ACC title all but three years. Clemson had lost to the 1980 national champions, seventh-ranked Georgia, 13–7, and tied Boston College, 17–17, after the opposing quarterback, Doug Flutie, led a comeback. Clemson was therefore unable to defend their NCAA championship, but either Clemson or Maryland, with perfect conference records, would secure the ACC title. Thus, decades before the official ACC Championship Game, 1982 saw a rare "de facto" title match. Clemson scored first, then pulled away 14–7 before half. In the second half, a favorable wind twice yielded Maryland excellent field position, Esiason threw for two rapid-fire touchdowns and a two-point conversion, and the defense held Clemson at bay. However, the Terrapins also turned the ball over five times in the second half and lost, 24–22. With the win, Clemson won the ACC and Maryland finished second. Immediately after the game, the NCAA announced its investigation into Clemson recruiting had found improprieties. As a result, the Tigers were denied a bowl game and television coverage in the following season. The ACC instituted further punishment, making Clemson ineligible for a conference title for the next two years. Maryland finished 1982 ranked 20th after losing to ninth-ranked Washington in the Aloha Bowl. In 1983, Maryland lost to third-ranked Auburn and 20th-ranked West Virginia, but beat 17th-ranked Pittsburgh and third-ranked North Carolina. Clemson and Maryland once more met with perfect ACC records, and Maryland again lost, this time blown out, 52–27. Despite the loss, Maryland was awarded the conference championship because of the sanctions against Clemson.
In 1984, Maryland defeated the defending national champions, sixth-ranked Miami, in what was then the biggest comeback in college football history and judged by some as the most exciting. At half time, Maryland trailed Miami, 31–0. Back-up quarterback Frank Reich replaced Stan Gelbaugh and proceeded to throw four touchdown passes, and capitalizing on Miami errors, the Terrapins won, 42–40. The recovery from the 31-point halftime deficit stood as the greatest college football comeback for the next 22 years, until the record was finally broken by Michigan State against Northwestern. Reich later repeated the feat in his professional career when he led the Buffalo Bills to overcome a 32-point deficit and set the NFL comeback record. That season, Maryland also defeated 17th-ranked West Virginia and 20th-ranked Clemson, and secured the ACC championship. In the postseason, they edged Tennessee, 28–27, in the Sun Bowl and finished 12th in the nation. Maryland entered the 1985 season with a number-one preseason rank, and set its all-time home attendance record in Byrd Stadium with an average of 49,385 over five games. However, they dropped to a ranking of 17th in Week 2, and then out of the polls in Week 4 after a shutout by Michigan. Despite the early setbacks, the Terrapins finished undefeated in six conference games to take the ACC championship for the third consecutive year. Maryland defeated Syracuse, 35–18, in the Cherry Bowl and earned a final ranking of 18th. In 1986, the Terrapins posted a mediocre 5–5–1 record.
After the season, Ross resigned as head coach. He expressed frustration over the university's failure to improve Byrd Stadium and its associated facilities. Ross had shown recruits stadium and facility renovation plans as an indication of the program's direction, and when they did not come to fruition, he felt that he had misled the players. Ross also stated that he was hurt by "innuendo, insinuation, and guilt by association" with respect to the cocaine-induced death of Maryland basketball star Len Bias. He said, "I feel the football team has represented the university well, both on and off the field." The athletics department investigation report had commended the propriety of the football program, but university chancellor John B. Slaughter did not offer his vocal support for Ross until a month later.
Joe Krivak (1987–1991).
Maryland athletics in general were marred by the death of Len Bias, and the football team was no exception. After Ross resigned, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Joe Krivak was promoted to head coach. This was the beginning of a lackluster period for Terrapins football. From 1987 to 2000, the Terrapins went 55–88 overall (.385) with only two winning seasons and one bowl appearance. The Krivak era was met with a brutal schedule with non-conference opponents consisting of national powers Michigan, Miami, Penn State, and Syracuse among others. After a 4–7 season in 1987, a controversial loss to Virginia in the final game of 1988 cost the team a sixth win for bowl eligibility. In 1989, Maryland tied Joe Paterno's 13th-ranked Penn State. The following season, the Terrapins beat 25th-ranked West Virginia and upset 8th-ranked Virginia. Maryland received a bid to the Independence Bowl and tied Louisiana Tech in what would be their only postseason appearance during this period. Athletic director Andy Geiger rewarded Krivak with a five-year contract extension, but the 1991 season unraveled after a rash of injuries, and Maryland had its worst finish in two decades with a 2–9 mark. After public criticism from several players, Krivak felt he lost credibility as the head coach and resigned on December 6.
Mark Duffner (1992–1996).
Geiger named Holy Cross head coach Mark Duffner as Krivak's replacement. Duffner had amassed a 60–5–1 record and two undefeated seasons in his six years at Holy Cross. At Maryland, he installed a run and shoot offense which shattered many school records, as of the end of the 2020 season, which still stand to the present day. However, his defenses were notoriously weak, usually giving up points so quickly that even his prolific offense couldn't keep up. For example, in the 1993 game against Virginia Tech, the Terrapins lost by 27 points despite gaining 649 yards of total offense. During this time, quarterbacks Scott Milanovich and John Kaleo set numerous school records for passing under Duffner, most of which still stand. In 1993, Maryland earned the dubious honor of most yards allowed per game, a record which also stands: in eleven games, the Terrapins surrendered 6,083 yards—an average of 553.0 yards per game. Maryland also gave up 236 more points than they scored, the worst point differential in school history. After the season, Duffner reorganized his staff by firing three assistant coaches. The team showed moderate improvement the next two years, and in 1995 finished 6–5, which was the first winning record since 1990. However, Maryland backslid in 1996 with a 5–6 record and a struggling offense. Duffner was fired after the season, having accumulated a combined record of 20–35.
Ron Vanderlinden (1997–2000).
Ron Vanderlinden was hired as head coach for the 1997 season under a five-year contract. Vanderlinden had helped engineer turnarounds at Northwestern as defensive coordinator and at Colorado as a defensive assistant. The 1995 Northwestern team in particular had shocked observers when it recorded a 10–2 season and the Big Ten championship. In 1999, Maryland showed signs of significant improvement, and a winning season appeared certain when Maryland possessed a 5–2 record. The Terrapins, however, then suffered a three-game losing streak. In their finale against Virginia, the Terrapins needed a win to garner a likely invitation to either the Aloha Bowl or Oahu Bowl—a Maryland alumnus was the chief executive officer of both events. The Terrapins came from behind and held the lead, 30–27, with 5:18 left to play. They regained possession with 1:40 remaining, but an inexperienced quarterback unintentionally stopped the clock by going out of bounds. After the ensuing punt, Virginia mounted a touchdown drive to win the game and end Maryland's bowl hopes. Despite narrowly missing a winning season, Vanderlinden was granted a two-year contract extension. In 2000, Maryland again fell short of a winning season and bowl game. The Terrapins entered their season closer with a 5–5 record, and again fell, this time in a rout by 24th-ranked Georgia Tech. Vanderlinden was fired the following day.
Despite the failure to deliver a winning season, Vanderlinden did oversee substantive improvement in the program. In 1998, the Terrapins were one of the most improved teams in defense, scoring defense, passing defense, and rushing. In 1999, Maryland allowed a conference low of 11 sacks compared with 56 in 1997. In that same period, Maryland also improved from last to first in the conference in rushing, due in large part to Heisman Trophy candidate and school career rushing leader LaMont Jordan. During Vanderlinden's tenure, Maryland also recruited several key players who were instrumental in the team's later success.
Ralph Friedgen (2001–2010).
Ralph Friedgen, a former Maryland player and assistant under Bobby Ross, was hired as Vanderlinden's replacement for the 2001 season. Friedgen had previously been denied an interview for the position twice by his alma mater. While offensive coordinator at Georgia Tech, he had been described as an "offensive genius", and Friedgen later received similar plaudits while at Maryland. When he took over, Maryland had not won a bowl game in 16 years and had only one winning season since 1990.
In 2001, Maryland won its first four games and entered the AP Poll for the first time since September 1995. Maryland beat 15th-ranked Georgia Tech in overtime when placekicker Nick Novak, the ACC's future all-time scoring leader, equalized and then won the game with 46- and 26-yard field goals, thereby ensuring a winning season and bowl appearance. In Tallahassee, 18th-ranked Florida State broke a stalemate in the fourth quarter to hand Maryland its only defeat of the regular season, 52–31. Maryland closed the year with a win over NC State, which secured the ACC championship and made the Terrapins the first team other than Florida State to take the title outright since the Seminoles joined the conference in 1991. Sixth-ranked Maryland then faced fifth-ranked Florida in the Orange Bowl—their first-ever BCS appearance, and their first major bowl of any sort since the 1977 Cotton Bowl. The Terrapins lost, 56–23, and finished with a 10–2 record and ranked 10th in the nation.
In 2002, Maryland had a preseason rank of 20th, but their first three games included a shutout by 12th-ranked Notre Dame, 22–0, and a loss to 16th-ranked Florida State, 37–10. The Terrapins rallied to defeat 13th-ranked West Virginia and 17th-ranked NC State, while losing only to Virginia. That loss, however, prevented Maryland from earning a share of the ACC championship alongside Florida State. The Terrapins routed Tennessee in the Peach Bowl, 30–3, and finished with an 11–3 record and final ranking of 18th. Maryland began the 2003 season with losses to Northern Illinois and eighth-ranked Florida State. They later defeated 23rd-ranked West Virginia, but were edged by Georgia Tech. In the postseason, 24th-ranked Maryland delivered a second crushing defeat against 20th-ranked West Virginia in the Gator Bowl, 41–7, and finished the season ranked 17th. "The New York Times" computer poll ranked Maryland third in the nation, behind only split-national champions Louisiana State and Southern California. The 2004 season was Friedgen's first with a losing record. Maryland finished with a 5–6 mark that included an overtime loss to West Virginia, 19–16. The highlight of the season was an upset victory over fifth-ranked Florida State, which was Maryland's first against the Seminoles and their first win against a top-10 team since 1990. The Terrapins again ended the 2005 season with a 5–6 record. That season opened with a victory over Navy, which was the first meeting between the intrastate foes in 40 years.
In 2006, Maryland returned to a bowl game and finished with a 9–4 record. During the season, the Terrapins upset 19th-ranked Clemson, 13–12, and five of their games were won by four points or less. In the Champs Sports Bowl, Maryland beat Purdue, 24–7. In 2007, Maryland overcame extensive injuries to again secure a postseason appearance. During the season, unranked Maryland tallied two shocking upsets against 10th-ranked Rutgers, 34–24, and eighth-ranked Boston College, 42–35. They finished the season with a rout of [[2007 NC State Wolfpack football team|NC State] to attain bowl eligibility, 37–0, but lost to [[2007 Oregon State Beavers football team|Oregon State]] in the [[2007 Emerald Bowl|Emerald Bowl]], 21–14. According to the final [[Jeff Sagarin|Sagarin]] computer-generated rankings, Maryland had the second-hardest schedule in the ACC and the 27th-hardest schedule among [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] teams.
[[File:FriedgenLastGame.jpg|150 px|thumb|Ralph Friedgen leads his team before his final game, the [[2010 Military Bowl]].]]
Numerous observers described Maryland's [[2008 Maryland Terrapins football team|2008 season]] as "wildly inconsistent". The Terrapins defeated four of their five ranked opponents—25th-ranked [[2008 California Golden Bears football team|California]], 19th-ranked [[2008 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]], 19th-ranked [[2008 Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team|Wake Forest]], and 17th-ranked [[2008 North Carolina Tar Heels football team|North Carolina]]—but also lost to heavy underdogs [[2008 Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football team|Middle Tennessee]] and [[2008 Virginia Cavaliers football team|Virginia]]. Ultimately, Maryland defeated [[2008 Nevada Wolf Pack football team|Nevada]] in the [[2008 Humanitarian Bowl|Humanitarian Bowl]] and finished the season with an 8–5 record. Before the [[2009 Maryland Terrapins football team|2009 season]], many analysts projected the Terrapins to finish last or second-to-last in the Atlantic Division of the ACC, and expressed particular concern with the inexperienced [[offensive line]]. The prognostications proved accurate, and Maryland finished 2–10 for their first ten-loss season in program history. Maryland rebounded in [[2010 Maryland Terrapins football team|2010]] to finish with a 9–4 record, including a win in the [[2010 Military Bowl|Military Bowl]], and ranked 23rd in the AP Poll. The ACC named Friedgen [[Atlantic Coast Conference football honors|Coach of the Year]], while freshman quarterback [[Danny O'Brien (American football)|Danny O'Brien]] became the first Terrapin ever named [[Atlantic Coast Conference football honors|ACC Rookie of the Year]]. Citing lack of fan support, the athletic department bought out the final year of Friedgen's contract for $2 million.
Randy Edsall (2011–2015).
[[File:Maryland Football Coach Randy Edsall.jpg|145 px|thumb|Coach Edsall]]
After Friedgen was let go, the Terrapins hired [[Randy Edsall]] away from [[Connecticut Huskies football|Connecticut]] to be Maryland's head coach. The 2011 season was not a successful one for Maryland. After a nationally televised win over [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]], the Terrapins struggled for the remainder of the season. They only managed to record one more win (against FCS opponent [[Towson Tigers football|Towson]]) and finished with a 2–10 record. The team did attract national attention for its "Maryland Pride" uniforms that were created by [[Under Armour]], who had become the official outfitter of the Maryland Athletic Department in September 2008.
After the 2011 season, Edsall fired both his offensive coordinator [[Gary Crowton]] and his defensive coordinator Todd Bradford. [[Mike Locksley]], who had been fired in 2011 from his head coaching position at [[New Mexico Lobos football|New Mexico]], was hired to be the new offensive coordinator. Locksley had previously worked at Maryland under head coaches Vanderlinden and Friedgen, and was the recruiting coordinator for Maryland before and during the three consecutive 10+ win seasons under Friedgen. [[Brian Stewart (American football)|Brian Stewart]], who had been the defensive coordinator for the [[Houston Cougars football|Houston Cougars]], was hired to replace Bradford as the new defensive coordinator.
Edsall's 2012 team compiled a 4–8 record, losing four quarterbacks to injury, and eventually starting a linebacker at the position. The team's record improved from 2011 nonetheless but still not as much as fans, alumni and the administration had hoped.
The 2013 Maryland Terrapins football team under head coach Edsall improved to 7–6, capping the season with a loss in the [[2013 Military Bowl|Military Bowl]] to [[Marshall Thundering Herd football|Marshall]], The 61st and final season the Terrapins would be playing football in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]].
Edsall's 2014 Terps finished their regular season with a 7–5 record, comprising a 4–4 record in Big Ten Conference play that put them third in the Big Ten East Division, their Inaugural season in the [[Big Ten Conference]] . Maryland ended its season at the [[2014 Foster Farms Bowl|Foster Farms Bowl]], where it lost to [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]].
On October 11, 2015, Edsall was relieved of his duties with offensive coordinator [[Mike Locksley]] named as the interim head coach for the rest of the 2015 season.
D. J. Durkin (2016–2018).
Durkin began serving as the head coach of the University of Maryland football team in 2015. Following the practice-related death of player Jordan McNair, Durkin was placed on leave in August 2018. [[Matt Canada]] was named acting head coach until further notice.
The University System of Maryland Board of Regents reinstated Durkin on October 30, 2018, causing protests and uproar. University of Maryland President Wallace Loh fired Durkin the next day.
Matt Canada (Interim; 2018).
On August 11, 2018, Canada became interim head coach for the Maryland Terrapins after [[D.J. Durkin]] was put on administrative leave following the death of [[Jordan McNair]], an offensive lineman for the Maryland Terrapins. After [[Mike Locksley]] was hired as the permanent head coach at Maryland going forward, Canada was relieved of the day-to-day head coaching responsibilities.
Mike Locksley (2019-Present).
On December 4, 2018, Locksley was named head football coach at the University of Maryland, becoming the 21st full-time head coach in program history. Locksley led Maryland to a strong offensive start. In the first game of the 2019 season, Maryland defeated [[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]] affiliate [[Howard Bison football|Howard]] 79-0, following that up with a victory against 21st-ranked [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]] 63-20. The 142 points in its first two games marked the Terps’ highest-ever scoring output in consecutive games, and the 63 points scored against Syracuse were the most points scored by a Maryland football team against a ranked opponent in program history. After starting strong and being ranked 21 in the AP polls, the Terrapins began struggling, finishing the season with a disappointing 3-9 record (1-5 Big 10), with a lone conference win at Rutgers in week 5.
Mike Locksley is a highly praised recruiter, and many Maryland fans are optimistic about the team’s future. On December 18, 2019, Maryland announced that they had gotten a commitment from 5-star recruit Rakim Jarrett, the Terrapins’ first 5-star recruit in over half a decade.

Joel Greenspoon

Joel Greenspoon (October 11, 1920 – April 24, 2004) was an American psychology researcher, professor, and clinician. 
Greenspoon made notable contributions to the field of behaviorism in psychology through pioneering work on verbal operant conditioning and counterconditioning in the treatment of anxiety.
Education.
Greenspoon received his B.A. degree from the University of Virginia in 1941. Immediately after college he coached at Fishburne Military School in Virginia. This experience (and world events at the time) led to his service in the United States Army from 1942-1946. Upon returning from duty he completed his M.A. degree in psychology at the University of Pennsylvania in 1947. He completed his education at Indiana University earning his Ph.D. degree in clinical psychology in 1952.
During his graduate school years at Indiana University he was directly supervised by Burrhus F. Skinner, William S. Verplanck, and J. R. Kantor. Greenspoon directly attributes his passion for behaviorism to his introduction to Skinner during Skinner’s chairmanship of the psychology department there.
Professional life.
Teaching and administrative work.
Greenspoon described his greatest passion as teaching. He taught continuously for 49 years and helped promote clinical psychology graduate programs, particularly advocating for the advancement of behaviorism in clinical practice and research. He began teaching as a faculty member at Pomona College immediately after receiving his Ph.D. He then helped develop the graduate program in clinical psychology at Florida State University and spent time at Arizona State University. He served as department chair of psychology and dean of arts and sciences at Temple Buell College, served as department chair of psychology at the University of Texas-Permian Basin, and served as department chair of psychology at the University of North Carolina – Charlotte. While at UTPB, he founded the Center for Behavioral Analysis. This Center was completely funded from proceeds from his private practice and continued to be so for 10 years following his death. He completed his career teaching at the University of North Texas where he was designated as an unpaid visiting professor. Greenspoon described this as his "dream job", characterizing it as "no pay, no responsibilities".
Clinical work.
Throughout his career Greenspoon provided therapy services utilizing the science of behavioral analysis and operant conditioning. He ran a private practice out of a mobile trailer during his time in Texas where he worked treating individuals, predominantly with anxiety disorders. He regularly consulted and worked in clinical settings within hospitals, universities, and community mental health centers. Towards the culmination of his career he advised many researchers applying behavioral principles to the treatment of autism in children. He also served on numerous clinical psychology licensing boards in Texas.
Research and publications.
Greenspoon authored over 50 journal articles and book chapters and wrote two textbooks accumulating over 1600 citations in peer literature. As an early proponent and central figure in the development of behavioral analysis in people, his work helped promote the field both in programming in universities across the nation and in scientific literature. He also had brief stints in his early career as a researcher at the U. S. Navy Electronics Laboratory and Aerojet General, both in California. 
His selected works include: 
Mentoring.
During his tenure at Arizona State University, Greenspoon supervised Robert O. Pihl’s graduate training. Pihl went onto a highly successful career as a clinical psychologist spearheading the field of alcohol-related aggression and substance abuse research at McGill University.
Awards and legacy.
Greenspoon was awarded the 2011 Texas Association for Behavioral Analysis Pioneer in Behavioral Analysis award for his contributions to behavioral analysis in Texas. Paul R. Fuller, a colleague of Greenspoon from Indiana University, described Greenspoon as "…not only a best friend, he was a role model and an inspiration in strength and persistence”.
Personal life.
Greenspoon was born on October 11, 1920 in the small community of Charles Town, West Virginia. He was married to Alice Marie Greenspoon for almost 49 years, and who survived him for many years before passing away on May 29, 2013. Together they had a son and two daughters.
Death.
Greenspoon died on April 20, 2004 at the age of 83 in Denton, Texas. He died due to complications from leukemia.

Barrier of the Unknown

Barrier of the Unknown () is a 1961 Soviet science fiction film directed by Nikita Kurikhin.
The film tells about the creators and testers of the Soviet pilot manned hypersonic airplane "Cyclone". In the USSR, there were many such programs which were left unfinished, but all the characteristics of the Cyclone (speed, altitude, etc., except for "radioactive combustion accelerators"), including flight characteristics (launch from a carrier aircraft) are exactly borrowed from the North American X-15.
Plot.
Far away in the Central Asian steppes a test site is hidden where new jet aircraft are being tested, including an experimental aircraft with a rocket engine on atomic radioactive accelerators, deployed from under the wing of a carrier aircraft and capable of making a suborbital manned space flight - to reach a thermosphere altitude of 100 km, as well as speeds over 7,200 km / h.
The pilot-engineer Sergei Fyodorovich Baikalov and the research officer Vera Borisovna Stankevich are sent to this range.
During the flight, the first tester of the "Cyclone" is Kazantsev. It is necessary to understand the cause of the disaster in order to prevent its recurrence. The situation is complicated by the fact that Kazantsev shortly before the disaster told about the glow he saw in the flight around the body of the plane, Vera Stankevich was called to investigate the mechanism. After the resumption of flights Baikalov does not see any glow on the second copy of the "Cyclone". But during the second flight, the glow appears again, more intense, and the accident happens this time with the second "Cyclone". But the Cyclone aircraft remains structurally whole and manageable, but although a radiation leak has started because of the accident. The pilot of the carrier plane rescues the Cyclone-2, knowing in advance that the leakage of radiation is possibly fatal to it.
Technical aspects of the story line.
In addition to the fact that many projects similar to American rocketplanes and orbital planes were conducted in the USSR, according to the reports of authoritative American publications such as Missiles and Rockets magazine, US military analysts reported the existence of the USSR's functional (non test-object) aerospace flying apparatus of a similar class, as indicated by a number of features. In the West, this hypothetical Soviet aircraft received the T-4A index.
Production accident.
During an interval in shooting, cinematographer's assistant Yuri Gakkel, who was the illegitimate son of Mikhail Kalatozov and the fiancé of actress Yevgenia Uralova, drowned.

Iván Duque Márquez

Iván Duque Márquez (; born 1 August 1976) is a Colombian politician and lawyer who is the current president of Colombia. He was elected as Colombia's youngest president, as the candidate from the Democratic Centre Party in the 2018 presidential election. Backed by his mentor, former president and powerful senator Alvaro Uribe and buoyed by a populist wave, he was elected despite having been relatively unknown a year before the election. He ran on a centre-right platform which included opposing the so-called "Havana Accords", the peace agreement with the FARC guerilla group.
His decision to provide temporary protected legal status to nearly 1.7 million Venezuelan migrants drew praise from leaders around the world. However, poverty and economic inequality worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Duque's failure to continue unconditional peace negotiations with ELN (after the 17 January terrorist attack) was also criticised by opposition parties and sections of the public. The police response to the resulting 2020 Bogota protests and the ongoing nationwide protests left 13 dead and around 400 injured, and approximately between 60 dead and 2,100 injured, respectively.
Life and career.
Duque was born in Bogota, in a wealthy political family originally from the Colombian town of Gómez Plata, Antioquia, son of Juliana Márquez Tono (political scientist) (1950–) and Iván Duque Escobar (1937–2016), a powerful local political leader who was Governor of Antioquia, auditor in the United Nations, Minister of Mines and Energy, and head of the National Registry of Civil Status in the Government of Andrés Pastrana. Duque's siblings are Andrés and María Paula.
Duque attended Colegio Rochester and graduated from Sergio Arboleda University in Bogotá in 2000 with a degree in law. He holds a LLM in International economic law from American University and a Masters in Public Policy Management from Georgetown University, Washington D.C.. Duque also attended an Executive education course at Harvard University for 5 days, where he studied business and government. 
He began his professional career in 1999 as a consultant in the Andean Development Corporation (CAF) and later served as an advisor at the Colombian Ministry of Finance and Public Credit during the government of Andrés Pastrana (1998–2002).
Subsequently, he was appointed by Juan Manuel Santos, future president and then Minister of Finance, as one of Colombia's representatives at the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), a post he held between 2001 and 2013. There he served as chief of the Division of Culture, Solidarity, and Creativity.
Duque also served as international advisor of former President Álvaro Uribe Vélez. Between 2010 and 2011, he was a consultant at the United Nations (UN) in the Panel of Inquiry appointed by the Secretary-General for the Incident of the Gaza Flotilla that occurred on 31 May 2010, between Israel and Turkey, known as Mavi Marmara.
Political background.
Duque returned to Colombia to become a candidate for the Senate in the legislative elections of 2014, for the Partido Centro Democrático (Democratic Center Party) which split away from the ruling governing party after Juan Manuel Santos opened peace negotiations with the FARC. This new party campaigned against the new peace agreement and the Santos Government, and was led by right wing former president Uribe.
Uribe created his own political party and presented himself and a list of hand picked political allies as candidates for the office of Congressman in a closed list, which meant that people could not vote for an individual congressman but had to vote for the party as a whole in both the upper and lower chamber elections. Duque was included in the number seven spot of the closed off list for the Senate and thus was elected senator. 
During his time as a senator, he was the author of four laws:
President of Colombia.
Election.
On 10 December 2017, Duque was nominated by his party as its candidate for President of Colombia. He won the nomination through a system of surveys conducted by the party, with a 29.47% favorability compared to the other two candidates: Carlos Holmes Trujillo who obtained 20.15%, and Rafael Nieto with 20.06%. In January 2018, it was announced that the center-right coalition would participate in the Grand Primary for Colombia – an interparty consultation – with Duque as its candidate confronting Marta Lucía Ramírez (civil-center right movement) and Alejandro Ordóñez (right wing civil movement). On 11 March 2018, Duque won the primary with more than 4 million votes. Ramírez was second, with just over 1.5 million votes, and Ordóñez came third with 385,000 votes. During his speech, Duque thanked the support of Colombians at the polls and announced Marta Lucía Ramírez as his running mate in the elections.
On 27 May 2018, Duque earned the most votes in the first round of the presidential election with over 39% of the vote. Duque was elected President of Colombia on 17 June 2018 after allegedly defeating Gustavo Petro 54% to 42% in the second round, although there have been many public complaints stating that the votes were manipulated to favor Duque. He was sworn in on 7 August 2018 at the Bogota's Bolivar Square.
Venezuelan refugee crisis.
The Presidency of Ivan Duque has continued the policies of his predecessor Juan Manuel Santos in regards to immigration, and the Venezuelan refugee crisis. Ivan Duque's government has been a vocal supporter for the Venezuelan Refugees at the United Nations and has provided aid, schooling and health care for many, and has been a vocal critic of other South American countries closing of doors to Venezuelan Refugees. In 2018, Duque dedicated 0.5% of government spending to supporting refugees accounting for about 20% of Colombia's budget short fall, despite opposition. In response to this criticism on a televised address Duque stated: "For those who want to make from xenophobia a political path, we adopt the path of brotherhood, for those who want to outcast or discriminate against migrants, we stand up today ... to say that we are going to take them in and we are going to support them during difficult times." Duque's policies regarding this issue have received repeated praise from international humanitarian organizations for its efforts to legalize, formalize and offer assistance to refugees, and the Atlantic has noted that it has set the bar welcoming refugees. A representative from the International Rescue Committee has noted that: "[she's] never seen a government trying this hard to register people and leave the borders open, unfortunately," she added "the scale of this crisis, and the speed at which it changes, is more than Colombia can handle."
Foreign policy.
During the 2020 United States elections, Duque's party Democratic Centre promoted Republican Party candidates in the United States, especially in Florida, sharing support for President of the United States Donald Trump. The involvement of a Colombian party promoting political candidates in a foreign election drew controversy among some observers. After Duque's party supported President Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election, relations between the government of President Joe Biden and Colombia became strained.
Protests.
The 2019–2020 Colombian protests were a collection of protests that have occurred since 21 November 2019. Hundreds of thousands of Colombians demonstrated to support the Colombian peace process and against the Duque government.
The 2021 Colombian protests began on 28 April 2021 against increased taxes proposed by the Duque government amid the pandemic.
Criminal investigation.
Following the publication of alleged evidence in March 2008 that Duque's political party conspired with the drug trafficking organization of Marquitos Figueroa to commit fraud in the presidential election, Congress's Accusations Committee and the National Electoral Council opened an investigation into his alleged role in the fraud. The Supreme Court opened a criminal investigation into his political sponsor, right-wing former President Alvaro Uribe, who is already being investigated for alleged witness fraud and bribery.
Published books.
Iván Duque is the author of the books "Monetary Sins" (2007), "Machiavelli in Colombia" (2010), "Orange Effect" (2015), "IndignAcción" (IndignAction) (2017) and is co-author of the book "The Orange Economy: An Infinite Opportunity" (2013). 
Duque has also been an Op-Ed contributor to several newspapers: "El Colombiano", from Medellín; "Portafolio" and "El Tiempo" from Casa Editorial El Tiempo in Bogotá; and "El País" in Spain.
Personal life.
Duque is Roman Catholic. He is married to María Juliana Ruiz Sandoval, with whom he has three children: Luciana, Matías and Eloísa.

Cornelius Jeremiah Vanderbilt

Cornelius Jeremiah Vanderbilt (December 29, 1830 – April 2, 1882) was an American member of the Vanderbilt family who, after having a troubled relationship with his father, Cornelius Vanderbilt, eventually committed suicide at the age of 51.
Early life.
Cornelius "Corneel" Jeremiah Vanderbilt was born on Staten Island on December 29, 1830. He was the second son of thirteen children born to Cornelius Vanderbilt and Sophia Johnson Vanderbilt, who were first cousins. He had 11 surviving siblings; Phebe, Ethelinda, Eliza, William ("Billy"), Emily, Sophia, Maria, Frances, Mary, Catherine, and George. He had another brother named George, born in 1832, who died as a toddler.
According to official records, Corneel was matriculated at Columbia College with the class of 1850, but did not graduate with the class.
When he was 18 years old, Corneel began suffering from epilepsy, which his father saw as weakness and even mental derangement, believing his son needed to be in a mental asylum. His father thought the epileptic fits were a punishment on himself for his having married his own cousin.
In 1849, in order to ‘toughen him up,’ his father sent the then 19 year old Corneel off to be a sailor aboard a three-masted schooner which was making its way to California and its gold fields. However, Corneel was stricken ill when he arrived in San Francisco and drew a draft on his father in order to pay for his return to New York. Upon his return, his father had him arrested for drawing the draft and committed him to the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum. Corneel's records from the asylum state: "Form of mental disorder: dementia (supported by father)"
He was finally discharged from the asylum on February 20, 1850.
Corneel being committed to Bloomingdale Insane Asylum by his father happened just five years after his mother, Sophia, had "also" briefly been committed by his father to the "same" asylum. In 1844, his father sent Sophia on a trip to Canada with one of their daughters, in order to have more private time with their governess (who promptly quit). When Sophia returned, she found that her husband had purchased a large townhouse at 10 Washington Place in New York City and intended it to be their new residence. She was so upset that she stood up to the domineering Cornelius and steadfastly refused to leave their Staten Island home and friends. His father decided that she was mentally unstable due to this behavior. He told their children that their mother was "in poor health" and that she "was at the change of life." Against protests from all of their children (except William), their father had their mother committed to Bloomingdale Insane Asylum. However, the physicians there insisted she return home. When she did, she reluctantly acquiesced to her husband's demands and moved to New York City.
Career.
On March 4, 1849, young Vanderbilt departed on a ship headed for San Francisco around Cape Horn to work as a crewman. Upon arrival in San Francisco, he abandoned the ship and spent all his money. When he ran out, he tried to charge his expenses to his father, who became livid and interpreted Corneel's actions as a sign of insanity. When Corneel returned to New York in November 1849, his father had him arrested and committed to the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum in New York until February 1850.
After his release, he tried out several occupations, including law clerk, leather merchant, farmer, and revenue agent; all of which he was unsuccessful at. He developed a gambling problem and reportedly used the Vanderbilt name and his considerable charm to borrow money, usually without paying them back. In particular, he obtained significant loans from Horace Greeley, the editor of the "New York Tribune" who was a long-time friend. Corneel was also close friends with Schuyler Colfax, who later became the 17th Vice President of the United States under Ulysses S. Grant.
In January 1854, the elder Cornelius again had Corneel arrested and committed to the asylum on the grounds of "confusion" and "loose habits." The doctor at the asylum reportedly told Corneel, "I am satisfied that you are no more crazy than I am," and let him go home. His elder brother William told him that they were trying to get him committed to the Asylum in order to avoid Corneel being charged criminally for his acts of forgery, to which Corneel reportedly replied that he would rather be considered a damn rascal than a lunatic.
Personal life.
In 1856, he married Ellen Williams (1820–1872) of Hartford, Connecticut, the daughter of a minister. The marriage was reportedly the only thing in Corneel's life that pleased his father; however, they did not have any children. With funds from his allowance, Corneel set up a fruit farm in East Hartford, Connecticut, but was unable to make the farm solvent, and had to file for bankruptcy in 1868.
After his mother's death in 1868, and the death of his wife in 1872, Vanderbilt "took up with George Terry, an unmarried hotel keeper whom Corneel considered 'my dearest friend.' Vanderbilt biographer T. J. Stiles has questioned whether the two may have been lovers, which the elder Cornelius may have suspected. Their letters between each other were intense, including a letter where Vanderbilt writes: "Oh! George I cannot give you up. You must not desert me now, but must be brave &amp; patient, and give me encouragement and hope for the future." Terry met with the Commodore in December 1873 about a business proposition in Toledo, Ohio, to which he replied: "Mr. Terry, if you go to Toledo, what will become of Corneel?"
Father's estate.
Upon his father's death in 1877, his elder brother William inherited the vast majority of the Vanderbilt estate and holdings (around $100,000,000), becoming the wealthiest man in the United States. According to his father's will, Corneel was only to inherit the income from $200,000 in U.S. Bonds held in trust (receiving 5% interest), which was distributed by trustees who were cautioned to oversee his behavior. Additionally, should Corneel try to advance funds from the Trust, he would lose it altogether.
After a lengthy court battle, William eventually paid Corneel an extra $600,000 ($200,000 in cash and $400,000 in additional trust) allowing him to pay off his debts, including to the estate of the late Horace Greeley, which aggregated to approximately $61,000 including interest. According to his obituary, "almost immediately after the settlement Cornelius J. went to Europe, accompanied by his particular friend, Mr. Terry, and remained abroad over six months."
The Commodore had purchased a 110-acre West Hartford estate in 1857 as a place for his Corneel to live. The land was not developed, and after the death of Corneel's wife in 1872, the Commodore sold the property. In 1879, two years after the elder Cornelius' death, Corneel repurchased the estate. After Corneel owned the estate, he built a 30-room home mansion, designed by John C. Mead, on the land.
1882 suicide.
On April 2, 1882, reportedly after a night spent at a gambling house, the 51-year-old C.J. Vanderbilt committed suicide by firing his Smith &amp; Wesson revolver into his left temple while staying in his fifth floor room number 80 at the Glenham Hotel on Fifth Avenue in New York City. He was discovered in his fifth floor room, number 80, by Terry, who was referred to in Vanderbilt's obituary as "his friend and constant companion." Terry was staying in an adjourning room, number 79, and reportedly rushed through the connecting door to Corneel's room upon hearing the gun shot that killed Vanderbilt.
Vanderbilt left his recently finished mansion in Hartford, which he was supposed to move into a few weeks later, to his dearest friend Terry. Terry sold the estate, which was subdivided into 32 building lots. The mansion was torn down in 1918, and today is the West Hill Historic District

Dangerous (Rumer song)

"Dangerous" is a song written and performed by British singer–songwriter Sarah Joyce, known by her stage name as Rumer, for her third studio album "Into Colour" (2014). It was released on 22 September 2014 and differs from most of her songs for its disco style and upbeat tone. The song was well received by critics and peaked at number 36 on the Japan Hot 100.
Composition.
Joyce explained that "Dangerous" was about her fear of re-entering the music industry after suffering through bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and ADHD, only translated to a love song: "I had so much resistance to going back into writing and performing publicly again that I realised I wasn’t going to be able to break through it until I literally wrote a song about the resistance itself." She songs on the song, "It’s taken me a long time to feel better babe / I’ve only just begun to feel my heart again." Helen Brown, a writer for "The Daily Telegraph", suggested the line "You want me to let go/ You want me to lose control/ But I don’t want to lose control," was a response to "critics who find her too smooth and safe." Musically, "Dangerous" is an uptempo, 1970s-inspired disco pop track that includes strings, jazz-esque bass, and a funk guitar section in its instrumentation, and the song differs from most of her music for being upbeat and disco-tinged.
Critical reception.
"Glasswerk" called "Dangerous" an "instant classic." Tom Ingham praised Joyce's vocal performance as her "most colourful and charged" to date. "The Observer" critic Paul Mardles, labeling most of "Into Colour" as "flat" and "forgettable," found "Dangerous" to be the album's most memorable track for its disco style. Writer Paul John, however, criticized it for being a "slightly dishonest representation of the remainder of the album," but nonetheless called it "a wonderful song in and of itself." "The Daily Express" described it as a "smooth and sexy hommage to the elegant days of early disco. Less 'sweaty dancefloor' and more 'martinis and mirrorballs.' Just the way we like it."
Music video.
On 15 October 2014, a video for the song "Dangerous" was released. Directed by Anthony Byrne and produced by Jess Bell, the video depicts a manager for a ballet company who crushes on a male ballet dancer.

The Defiant Ones (1986 film)

The Defiant Ones is a 1986 American made-for-television crime drama film directed by David Lowell Rich starring Robert Urich and Carl Weathers. It is a remake of the 1958 film of the same name.
Synopsis.
Cullen Monroe and Johnny "Joker" Johnson are prisoners who hate each other and get into a fistfight, causing them to be transported to a different jailhouse by car. During transport they come to blows again, causing an accident. They escape the car but remain chained to each other while the sheriff hunts them.
Production and broadcast.
The film is a remake of "The Defiant Ones", the 1958 film that inspired Carl Weathers to become an actor. It premiered on ABC at 9:00 p.m. on Sunday, January 5, 1986.
Reception.
In comparing the film to the original version, Walter Goodman of "The New York Times" wrote that "1986 is not 1958" and joked that the remake is "nothing if not moving. The two keep moving from the opening credits to the close." He further opined that the film contained "enough running music to score the New York Marathon."

Moritz G. Melchior

Moritz Gerson Melchior (22 June 1816 - 19 September 1884) was a Jewish-Danish businessman. He headed the trading house Moses &amp; Søn G. Melchior from 1845. He owned the property at Pliug HousHøjbro Plads 21 in Copenhagen as well as the country house Rolighed. Moritz G. Melchior and his wife Dorothea Melchior were some of Hans Christian Andersen's closest friends in the later part of his life.
Early life and education.
Melchior was born into a wealthy Jewish family in Copenhagen, the son of Gerson Moses Melchior (1771-1845) by his second wife Birgitte (Jette) Melchior née Israel (1792-1855). His father was second generation in the trading house Moses &amp; Søn G. Melchior.
Career.
Melchior joined the family firm just after his Bar Mitzvah at the age of 13. It had initially specialised in import of tobacco from the Netherlands and Bremen but later engaged in trade on the Danish West Indies. Two elder brothers joined the company but died in 1834 and 1843. Moritz G. Melchior joined the company in 1840 and became its sole owner upon his father's death in 1845. His younger brother Moses Melchior became a partner in the company in 1850.
Public life.
Melchior was elected to the board of representatives of the Jewish community in Copenhagen and served as its president in 1852-53. He was also a member of Grosserer-Societetet's governing committee and served as its president in 1873-84. He was a member of sø- og handelsretten from 1862 to 1883 and of the City Council in 1851-69. He was elected to the Port Council in 1859 and remained a member even after leaving the city council. He was also involved in reorganizing the Copenhagen Police Force with inspiration from England.
Melchior was elected to Landstinget (Parliament) in 1866-74. He was a co-founder of Frihandelsforenignen (Free Trade Society) in 1861 but left the organisation fairly early. He was a co-founder of Privatbanken in 1857 and served as vice chairman of its board from 1876.
Property.
 
Melchior acquired the building at Højbro Plads 21 in 1855. The building is from 1798 and was designed by Andreas Hallander. It is now known as the Ploug House after a later owner. Melchior lived with his family in the apartment on the second floor and also operated his company from the complex.
Melchior also acquired the country house Rolighed in Østerbro in 1858. In 1869-70, it was subject to a major expansion in Renaissance Revival style. The building was demolished in 1898.
Personal life.
Melchior married (Deiche) Dorothea Henriques (16 February 1823 - 16 February 1885) on 17 June 1846 in the Synagogue in Copenhagen. She was a daughter of broker Ruben Henriques (1771-1846) and (Jeruchine) Josika Melchior (1784-1857).
Moritz G, Melcior and Dorothea Melchior had eight children of which four died as infants:
Hans Christian Andersen was a close friend of the family from circa. 1859. Andersen stayed with the family from 13 March until 21 May 1870 in their residence on Højbro Plads, where he wrote "What the Whole Family Said", and the Melchiors also hosted the celebration of his 70th birthday. He spent his last year at Rolighed where he died on 4 August 1875.
Legacy.
Melchiors Plads, located close to Melchior's now demolished country house Rolighed, is named after him. A plaque on Kalkbrænderi Vej 16 commemorates that Hans Christian Andersen died at the site.

The Naskaupi River is the second largest river in Labrador, Canada. Its drainage basin lies north of that of Labrador's longest river, the Churchill River. Like the Churchill River, it drains into the western end of the estuary known as Lake Melville.
The Naskapi First Nation peoples used the river to travel to Labrador. Several expeditions explored the river around the turn of the 19/20th century. Mina Benson, the widow of Leonidas Hubbard, who died on a failed 1903 expedition is noted as having made admirable observations during a successful 1905 expedition. Frank Weston Benson, an American artist with not apparent relationship to Mina Benson, sketched the Naskapi.
The river's drainage basin is . The basin has no permanent inhabitants, and no roads. Just under half the area is covered by forest. Slightly more than one quarter of the area is covered by other vegetation. Approximately 17 percent is covered by lakes, rivers, or wetlands. The government of Newfoundland and Labrador classes the rest as "barren" or "unclassified".
When a series of 88 dikes were built, to establish the Smallwood reservoir, for the Churchill Falls Hydroelectric Project, water was diverted from the Naskaupi River to the Churchill River drainage basin.

Kimberly Gardner

Kimberly M. Gardner (born Aug. 2, 1975) is an American politician and attorney from the state of Missouri. She is the circuit attorney for the city of St. Louis, Missouri. She previously served as a member of the Missouri House of Representatives.
Early life and education.
Gardner was born in 1975 and raised in St. Louis, Missouri. Her family runs a funeral home in North St. Louis, at which she also worked. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in healthcare administration from Harris–Stowe State University in 1999. She then earned a Juris Doctor from the Saint Louis University School of Law in 2003 and a Master of Science in nursing from Saint Louis University in 2012.
Career.
Pre-public life and State Rep..
Gardner worked at Bell, Kirksey &amp; Associates and as an assistant prosecutor (St. Louis Circuit Attorney's Office, 2005–2010) prior to being elected as Circuit Attorney. From 2013 to 2017 she was a Missouri State Representative for District 77.
Circuit attorney.
Gardner took office on January 6, 2017. She is the first African-American to head the Circuit Attorney's Office. Under Gardner's tenure, St. Louis has seen a significant increase in non-prosecuted felonies. In 2019, St. Louis police sought 7,045 felony cases, but only 1,641 were prosecuted by Gardner's office. Many were returned to the police citing insufficient evidence, despite claims of sufficient evidence to prosecute by the police union.
Gardner continued the prosecution of former St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department police officer Jason Stockley for first degree murder in the shooting of Anthony Lamar Smith, a case first filed by her predecessor Jennifer Joyce. The acquittal in the bench trial in a controversial decision by Judge Timothy Wilson led to intense protests in the latter months of 2017.
As Circuit Attorney, Gardner has reduced and removed or reduced amounts of cash bond for minor, nonviolent offenses. She is also expanding diversion and drug court programs, and consulting with the Vera Institute of Justice on these issues. She is ending prosecutions of low-level marijuana possession and is dismissing many cases. The CAO is sharing a federal grant to work with the Midwest Innocence Project on wrongful convictions.
Staff shortage.
The Circuit Attorney's Office has experienced a more than 100% turnover rate in staff since Gardner took office. "The St. Louis Post-Dispatch" reported in September 2019 that "over 65 attorneys with a combined experience of over 460 years in prosecutorial experience" have left the Circuit Attorney's office under Gardner.
Grand jury process.
Kim Gardner's office charges defendants under direct complaint and then uses the grand jury process to delay the preliminary hearing. This wait on average is 344 days as of March 2021. The Missouri Supreme Court changed the rules on preliminary hearings effective March 1, 2021, to that "courts must hold preliminary hearings within 30 days of felony complaints being filed if a defendant is in jail, and within 60 days if not." Kim Gardner's continued use of the grand jury process has circumvented the Supreme Court's attempt at reform.
Controversies.
Eric Greitens investigation and indictment.
Gardner's office secured a grand jury indictment of sitting Missouri Governor Eric Greitens in February 2018, for felony invasion of privacy. On April 20, 2018, Gardner's office announced a new charge of tampering with computer data against Greitens. The governor was swiftly released on his own recognizance. Then Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley had opportunity to prosecute but declined to do so. In May 2018, the judge in the Greitens case ruled that the defense could call Gardner as a witness due to suspected criminal conduct by the prosecution. Following the judge's ruling, Gardner's office announced that they would be dismissing the invasion of privacy charge, citing that Gardner could not testify in a case her office was prosecuting. Following the Governor's announcement that he planned to resign, Gardner announced that all charges against Greitens would be dropped.
On May 15, 2018, Missouri Governor Eric Greitens' attorneys filed a police report with the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department alleging perjury by William Don Tisaby, an ex-FBI agent and private investigator that Gardner hired to investigate Greitens. Defense attorneys also cited $100,000 in secret cash payments to witnesses, payments they stated were concealed from the defense team by Gardner, as well as numerous meetings between the Circuit Attorney and William Tisaby, and "a major witness in the case". In a statement regarding the police report, defense attorneys said, "By law, both the Circuit Attorney and William Tisaby were required to testify about what was said and done in those secret meetings. Both refused to do so." Tisaby asserted his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in response to over 50 questions.
Special prosecutor investigation.
On June 29, 2018, St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Mullen appointed St. Louis attorney Gerard Carmody as special prosecutor to investigate allegations of criminal misconduct in the case against Governor Eric Greitens. Gardner appealed the appointment of a special prosecutor to the Missouri Supreme Court, which ruled that Gardner had a conflict of interest in the case and upheld Mullen's appointment of Carmody. The Missouri Supreme Court also rejected an appeal from Gardner's office seeking to block a search warrant signed by Mullen for the files of Gardner's office; the court ordered Gardner to turn over servers requested by Carmody.
On June 17, 2019, a 30-page grand jury indictment was unsealed against William Don Tisaby, the private investigator hired by Gardner to investigate Greitens, charging him with six counts of felony perjury and one count of felony tampering with evidence. The indictment alleges that Tisaby lied under oath about "matters that could substantially affect, or did substantially affect, the course or outcome of the Greitens case" (specifically, about his contacts with a major witness in the case and the nature of those conversations) and had concealed documents from defense attorneys. Tisby pleaded not guilty. In June 2019, Tisaby's attorney told reporters that "Ms. Gardner is probably the actual target here, not Mr. Tisaby." Although Gardner was not indicted, the indictment against Tisaby stated that Gardner "failed to correct Tisaby’s lies, failed to report them to police, and made incorrect statements to defense lawyers and the judge."
On July 10, 2019, the grand jury disbanded without charging Gardner. The next day, Gardner held a press conference denying any wrongdoing in Greitens's case (her first public statement on the matter since the appointment of the special prosecutor, as a gag order had been placed on the case for the duration of the grand jury) and saying it was time for the city to "move on".
Following the press conference, special prosecutor Carmody took the unusual step of putting out a statement clarifying that the grand jury disbanded because its term expired, not because the investigation was complete. Carmody announced that despite the original grand jury's conclusion, his investigation would continue, pointing out his authority to seat a new grand jury to review any evidence relating to Gardner's conduct.
Tisaby's motion to dismiss the indictment against him was denied by St. Louis Circuit Judge Bryan Hettenbach, who also placed a protective order on approximately 4,000 documents at Carmody's request to protect the privacy of some parties involved in the Greitens case and the integrity of "an active criminal investigation" focused on the failed prosecution of Greitens.
On July 2, 2021, Judge Bryan Hettenbach approved Carmody's withdrawal from the case and appointed Johnson County prosecutor Robert Russell to the case. The court ordered the city of St. Louis to pay Russell's expenses. Judge Bryan Hettenbach also denied Tisaby's attorneys' motion to dismiss the case and the sanctioning of Carmody for allegedly not providing transcripts.
Misconduct Probe.
It was published on May 4, 2021 that the Missouri's State Disciplinary Counsel found probable cause that during the Greitens prosecution. Gardner will face a disciplinary panel and any possible punishment will be decided by the Missouri Supreme Court which could range from admonishment to the suspension or revocation of her law license. An expert on prosecutorial misconduct, Professor Bennett Gershman, described the case as "startling" and an unusual invocation of Brady v. Maryland, on which the record focuses.
Exclusion list.
In summer 2018, the existence of an "exclusion list" (similar to a "Brady list" in other jurisdictions) of 28 SLMPD officers whose conduct is considered so tainted by misconduct that the CAO would no longer accept testimony or evidence in court cases and would reconsider past cases. Fifty-five prosecutors and law enforcement officials from across the United States signed a statement supporting Gardner's Brady List. Gardner, in February 2019, announced that the CAO and police department are working together on problems stemming from the list. In January 2019, Gardner's office accused officers within SLMPD of obstructing their investigation in the shooting death of officer Katlyn Alix by officer Nathaniel R. Hendren, one of two officers charged with crimes relating to the incident, which resulted in a sharp rebuke by Chief John Hayden.
Traffic stop controversy.
On December 23, 2019 (the day before Christmas Eve), Kim Gardner was pulled over by St. Louis downtown police on Market Street for a traffic stop. In January 2020, Gardner made numerous news interviews and public claims stating that: the stop was on December 24, 2019 (Christmas Eve), police had held her for 15 minutes without stating why, and that these were "intimidation tactics used by the police to stop reform". Police records state that the stop occurred on December 23, 2019 instead. KMOV4 news also published video evidence from a camera across the street revealing that St. Louis downtown police had pulled Gardner over when her car was shown driving without headlights on at night, and that the stop lasted for only 6 minutes. Gardner continued to claim that the stop lasted 15 minutes and was without reason. The Circuit Attorney's Office also sent an email statement that "According to the police it was a 15 minute stop. In addition, the officer's statement is different than the one shared by Jeff Roorda." The St. Louis Police Sergeant then issued a follow-up statement that the police had never stated Gardner was detained for 15 minutes. The St. Louis Police statement also reveals that an investigator from the Circuit Attorney's Office had attempted to involve himself into the traffic investigation, which is an illegal act and the investigator could have been arrested for it. The St. Louis Police did not arrest the investigator. The Circuit Attorney's Office continued to assert Gardner's false allegations.
Campaign finance violations.
In 2019, Gardner admitted to repeat campaign finance violations dating back to her time as a Missouri state legislator. These violations included using campaign donations to pay for a private apartment. Gardner reached an agreement with the Missouri Ethics Commission to pay a settlement of $6,314 in lieu of a $63,009 fine.
Civil rights lawsuit.
In January 2020, Gardner filed a civil rights lawsuit against St. Louis City and St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department on the basis of the Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, and Ku Klux Klan Act of 1865, alleging a racist conspiracy. The lawsuit cites a 2016 report from the Ethical Society of Police detailing a history of racial discrimination in the police force, as well as the Plain View Project's report exposing city police officers' racist social media activities.
The city and the St. Louis Police Officers Association, led by Jeff Roorda, denied the lawsuit's allegations. Several African American women district attorneys, including Marilyn Mosby and Aramis Ayala, traveled to St. Louis to demonstrate support for Gardner, declaring that she has been targeted by a "fundamentally racist" system which they also contend against.
On 30 September 2020, U.S. District Judge John Andrew Ross dismissed Gardner’s lawsuit. The judge wrote that: wrote: “Her 32-page complaint can best be described as a conglomeration of unrelated claims and conclusory statements supported by very few facts, which do not plead any recognizable cause of action” and continued that "Gardner presents no specific material facts, circumstantial or otherwise, to show that defendants acted with each other for the purpose of depriving her – or anyone else – of a constitutional right to equal protection. Her complaint is nothing more than a compilation of personal slights – none of which rise to a legal cause of action."  Judge Ross is a federal judge for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. He was nominated by President Barack Obama in December 2010. Prior to becoming a federal judge, Ross was a circuit court judge for the 21st Circuit Court in Missouri. The costs to defend her out of taxpayer funds has been widely discussed. Invoices and receipts obtained by the Post-Dispatch show the city in June approved and paid the Brown &amp; James firm about $153,600 in legal bills to defend the Circuit Attorney’s Office against two lawsuits. The city paid about 80% of those bills three weeks after Circuit Judge Joan Moriarty blocked payments to at least five other private firms.
Open records lawsuit.
In January 2020, Fox News contributor and political commentator John Solomon sued Gardner and several others—including former State Representatives Jay Barnes and Stacey Newman, billionaire political donor George Soros, and individuals connected to the state's low income housing tax credit industry—in the St. Louis Circuit Court, alleging violations of Missouri's open records laws. Solomon claimed that Gardner's office violated the state's "Sunshine Law" by refusing to make available records involving investigations into former Republican Missouri Governor Eric Greitens.
McCloskey prosecution.
In June 2020, 36 people were arrested in St. Louis during two nights of the George Floyd protests for alleged trespassing, burglary, property damage, assault, and theft. All were released, two after being issued summons, eight after prosecutors declined to immediately file a charge, and the rest "while police apply for charges." Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, a Republican, criticized Gardner on Twitter over the arrestees' release. Gardner said she would bring "the full power of the law" against those responsible for violent acts, but, responding to Schmitt, said that the prosecutor's office cannot bring charges against individuals without admissible evidence from police. Gardner criticized Schmitt for launching "a politically motivated attack against me, even if it means misleading and lying to the public."
In December 2020, a judge disqualified Gardner from prosecuting the case against Mark McCloskey, writing that "the Circuit Attorney’s conduct raises the appearance that she initiated a criminal prosecution for political purposes".
Dropped charges controversy.
In July 16, 2021 charges in a murder case due to the prosecutor not showing up to multiple hearings in the case. The Judge in the case saying that Gardner's office "essentially abandoned its duty to prosecute those it charges with crimes.” Kim Gardner declared in a press briefing charges were refiled and the man was in custody, although was not. The family of the man who was killed claimed they were not contacted when the defendant was released, which violates state laws. On July 20 Gardner's office finally contacted the family about the case and apologized to the family. The prosecutor assigned to the case was on maternity leave, whose signature was forged on at least 20 cases, quit after learning of what happened. Gardner blamed the mistake on the office's internal policy and procedures on Family Medical Leave. The dismals rate of cases since Gardner has taken office has doubled and is double of surrounding counties.
In another case, one of Gardner's prosecutors entered in a plea deal with the defendant without telling the family of the victim, which violates state law. The mother learned of this update when she called Gardner's office to know when she should fly up to see the case. The mother claims the first prosecutor was not going to accept the deal and was going to prosecute the case. The mother wrote letters to the judge in the case not to accept the plea deal and claims Gardner and two of her associates called her to bully her into accepting the deal.

Ghetto Day/What I Need

"Ghetto Day"/"What I Need" is the second single from American singer-songwriter Crystal Waters' second studio album, "Storyteller" (1994). It was produced by The Basement Boys and released in June 1994 by Mercury Records, A&amp;M Records and A&amp;M's division AM PM. Waters and Sean Spencer wrote "Ghetto Day", which is a funk song that contains samples from The 5th Dimension's song "Stoned Soul Picnic" and Flavor Unit's "Flavor Unit Assassination Squad". According to "Spin", the track's lyrics talk about "those balmy, front-stoop, 40-swinging summer afternoons." The single's second A-side, "What I Need", is a house track written by Waters, Doug Smith and Richard Payton.
Contemporary critics complimented both songs and noted them as the album's highlights. Commercially, the joint release entered the top forty in the United Kingdom. "What I Need" was released separately in October 1994, and later became Waters' fourth single to top the "Billboard" Dance Club Songs Chart. It also reached the top spot of the Bubbling Under Hot 100 and  82 of the "Billboard" Hot 100. In other media, "What I Need" was featured in the film "Double Dragon" (1994) and an episode of television series "So You Think You Can Dance Canada".
Compositions.
Like the majority of songs on "Storyteller" (1994), both "Ghetto Day" and "What I Need" were produced, arranged and mixed by The Basement Boys, with Waters credited as their main writer. Additionally, Sean Spencer co-wrote the former track, and Doug Smith and Richard Payton co-wrote the latter.
Musically, "Ghetto Day" is a mid-tempo funk, hip hop and doo-wop track that has an "easy flow" and a "gently funky conversation" where Waters "opens up." Larry Flick of "Billboard" described the song as a "splash of cool retro-funk that is laced with licks" from its sampling of The 5th Dimension's "Stoned Soul Picnic". It also contains portions of Flavor Unit's 1996 track "Flavor Unit Assassination Squad". According to Jonathan Bernstein from "Spin", the lyrical content of "Ghetto Day" "rhapsodizes about those balmy, front-stoop, 40-swinging summer afternoons." Charles Aaron from the same publication wrote of the lyrics: "Going home, she listens to Grandma talk to the Lord, babies scream, old men go tra-la-la, and her brother sing the praises of a 40-ounce on a sunny day."
On the other hand, "What I Need" was described as a house piece and one of the album's "jovial, upbeat" moments, where Waters performed her vocal in a "sick, tired, and simmering" manner.
Reception.
Critical reviews.
Peter Galvin of "The Advocate" stated that "Ghetto Day" was "more listener-friendly" than the other songs on the album, with lyrics that offered "a paradisaical view of life and love in the slums, made convincing by the use of a sample from Fifth Dimension's summery 'Stoned Soul Picnic'." "Billboard" called it "a languid, liquid sketch of a lazy city afternoon", and noted that "it gets the nod as [the album's] likeliest knockout contender." Also Fred DeUar of "High Fidelity News and Record Review" praised the sampling of 'Stoned Soul Picnic', stating that it was done "in the cause of better-class '90s pop." Ernest Hardy from the "Los Angeles Times" called "Ghetto Day" a "sugary, hip hop, doo-wop inner-city fantasy". Andy Beevers from "Music Week" gave it four out of five, calling it "a breezy and funky mid-tempo song, purpose-made for radio play on a Summer afternoon." James Hamilton from the magazine's "RM" Dance Update deemed it a "radio aimed gorgeous gentle 90bpm summery hip hop soul" track. "Spin" Charles Aaron thought it was "a more sublime sound than any arm-twisting remix", while Jonathan Bernstein described it as "languid" and one of the "noteworthy" "Storyteller" tracks.
Ron Wynn from AllMusic declared "What I Need" one of the album's best. "Billboard" Larry Flick labelled it a "floor-filler" and an "upbeat rouser." Another reviewer from the same publication thought "What I Need" was one of the hits to be had from "Storyteller". "Vibe" magazine stated "What I Need" and "100% Pure Love", the album's first single, "ooze with giddy abandon—not to mention juicy grooves that seep deeper into the brain and body upon repeated spins." "What I Need" was claimed by "Spin" Bernstein to have "xeroxed" Clivillés and Cole's 1991 single "A Deeper Love". However, he predicted that it could have been a potential successor to her previous signature hits, "Gypsy Woman" and "Makin' Happy".
Commercial performance.
"Ghetto Day" and "What I Need" were released as a double A-side single in June 1994. The joint release peaked at  40 on the UK Singles Chart and at No. 94 on the ARIA Top 100 Singles Chart. In October 1994, Mercury Records released "What I Need" separately, and later sent the track to contemporary hit radios in January 1995. It eventually gained Waters her fourth No. 1 single on the "Billboard" Dance Club Songs Chart of November 5, 1994. On the chart's year-end edition of 1994, it peaked at No. 42. The song also topped the Bubbling Under Hot 100 before reaching No. 82 of the "Billboard" Hot 100. However, the latter entry was the singer's lowest peak on the chart. "What I Need" also climbed to No. 7 on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales and No. 32 on the Top 40 Airplay Rhythm-Crossover.
Promotion and other usages.
The music video for "Ghetto Day" marked Waters' second work with German director Marcus Nispel, following "100% Pure Love". It shows the singer performing around an African-American neighborhood, with scenes tinted in a yellow-orange tone. Pam Thomas directed the video for "What I Need", which consists of scenes of Waters shot primarily in a bathroom. BET added the clips to the channel's playlist in late August 1994 and early March 1995, respectively.
Waters performed "Ghetto Day" on the June 30, 1994 episode of British music-chart television programme "Top of the Pops". "100% Pure Love" and "What I Need" were subsequently featured in the 1994 action film "Double Dragon", but only the latter was included on its soundtrack album. During the fourth season of "So You Think You Can Dance Canada", two contestants—JP Dubé and Geisha Chin—performed "What I Need" on its twelfth episode which aired on August 1, 2011.

The Trials of Ted Haggard

The Trials of Ted Haggard is a documentary film made by Alexandra Pelosi, following disgraced pastor Ted Haggard. According to HBO, this is a follow-up to Pelosi's 2007 HBO film which starred Haggard as the head of the National Association of Evangelicals. Pelosi returns to talk with 'Pastor Ted' about his fall from grace. The New York Times called it "strangely intriguing" because "The film doesn’t merely document Mr. Haggard’s fall from grace, it also tracks the pathology of his attempt at a comeback. It’s a cautionary tale for disgraced public figures; for viewers it’s a master class in the art of self-serving remorse and hubris dressed up as humility."
The Los Angeles Times said, ""The Trials of Ted Haggard" is a strange, disturbing, but in the end heartbreaking little film that may wind up being the most powerful indictment of homophobia since "Brokeback Mountain"." The Variety review said "Pelosi peels back the symbol enough to expose fleeting glimpses of the man underneath — peddling only himself, and, as in his door-to-door gig, unable to make the sale."

The company was founded in 1999, through a partnership between Società Autostrade (through Sitec, 32%), British Telecom (20%), Benetton (through the financial Edizione Holding, 9%), Mediaset (9%) , Distacom (9%), BNL (7%), Italgas (7%), Caltagirone (7%) and Palatinus. Its slogan was "Il futuro che non c'era" ("The future that was not there").
Its service began on May 15th, 2000, using license number 61, issued shortly after the launch by the Italian Ministry of Communications. The services were valid for communications through the GSM system on the 1800 MHz frequency band: the signal with its own network was initially irradiated only in Milan while, in the rest of Italy, the transmission occurred within the GSM network of other operators thanks to national roaming agreements.
With 430,000 users in September 2000, the company exceeded its initial target of 350,000 customers by the end of the year. The lack of agreement between British Telecom and the other shareholders regarding the distribution of shares put the company's participation in the auction for the awarding of UMTS licenses, which were initially confirmed, and then withdrawn on October 23rd. The case involved judicial trials that ended in January 2001, when the Lazio Regional Administrative Court annulled the government confiscation of the surety of 4 trillion lire.
In December 2000, the company continued its development, launching a GPRS service which exceeded one million users in March 2001. In August of the same year, the company acquired the license for fixed telephony. Despite the continued expansion, with 1,600,000 customers at the end of 2001 and a market share of new activations of 13%, the first defections began among the company's partners. Edition renounced its shares in September 2001 after the entry into the Telecom Italia group, and Mediaset followed in when it sold its shares in December 2001 to British Telecom.
The company entered a phase of progressive demobilization. On August 6, 2002, the board of directors gave the go-ahead to the company break-up, opting for the sale of the customer base (4% of the Italian market) and brand to Wind, its mobile telephone systems to TIM, Wind and Vodafone Omnitel, the share capital at TIM and other branches of the company at H3G. 
Blu turned off its signal on October 8, 2002, disappearing from the communications world.

Artificial intelligence industry in China

The artificial intelligence industry in China is a rapidly developing multi-billion dollar industry. As of 2021, the market of artificial intelligence is worth about RMB 150 billion (US$23.196 billion), and the figure is projected to reach RMB 400 billion (US$61.855 billion) by 2025. Since 2006, China has steadily developed a national agenda for artificial intelligence development, and has emerged as one of the leading nations in artificial intelligence research and development.
History.
In 2006, China announced the policy priority in development of artificial intelligence, which is included in the National Medium and Long Term Plan for the Development of Science and Technology (2006-2020), released by the State Council.
The State Council of China issued the "A Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan" (State Council Document [2017] No. 35) on July 8, 2017, in which the CCP Central Committee and the State Council urged the governing bodies of China to promote the development of artificial intelligence. Specifically, the plan describes AI as a “strategic technology” that has become a “focus of international competition”.:2 The document urges significant investment in a number of strategic areas related to AI and calls for close cooperation between the state and private sector. On the occasion of CCP general secretary Xi Jinping's speech at the first plenary meeting of the CMCFDC, scholars from the National Defense University in their analysis of the integration of military and civilian development wrote in the PLA Daily that the "transferability of social resources" between economic and military ends is an essential component to being a great power.
In 2018, the State Council budgeted $2.1 billion on an AI industrial park in Mentougou district. In order to achieve this end, the State Council states the need for massive talent acquisition, theoretical and practical developments, and public and private investments.
Some of the stated motivations that the State Council has given for pursuing its AI strategy include the potential of artificial intelligence for industrial transformation, better social governance and maintaining social stability. The State Council reports three general milestones for their integration of artificial intelligence into their industrial economy. By 2020, the State Council predicts that China will have contributed globally to hardware, software, and methods pertinent to artificial intelligence. Specifically, the State Council projects the value of AI core industry in China to be worth 150 billion RMB, with a value of over 1 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.
By 2025, the State Council aims for China to have fundamentally contributed to basic AI theory, solidifying its place as a global leader in AI research. Further, the State Council aims that "AI becomes the main driving force for China's industrial upgrading and economic transformation" by this time. The State Council projects the value of AI core industry in China to be worth 400 billion RMB, with a value of over 5 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.
By 2030, the State Council targets China to be the global leader in the development of artificial intelligence theory and technology. The State Council claims that China will have developed a "mature new-generation AI theory and technology system." At this point, the State Council projects the value of AI core industry to be worth 1 trillion RMB, with a value of over 10 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.
Industry developments.
According to a February 2019 publication by the Center for a New American Security, China’s leadership – including Chinese leader Xi Jinping – believes that being at the forefront in AI technology will be critical to the future of global military and economic power competition. China is by far the United States’ most ambitious competitor in the international AI market, and China's 2017 “Next Generation AI Development Plan” describes AI as a “strategic technology” that has become a “focus of international competition”.:2 According to the document, China will seek to develop a core AI industry worth over 150 billion RMB132—or approximately $21.7 billion—by 2020 and will “firmly seize the strategic initiative” and reach “world leading levels” of AI investment by 2030.:2-6 Recent Chinese achievements in the field demonstrate China's potential to realize its goals for AI development. In 2015, China's leading AI company, Baidu, created AI software capable of surpassing human levels of language recognition, almost a year in advance of Microsoft, the nearest U.S. competitor. In 2016 and 2017, Chinese teams won the top prize at the Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, an international competition for Computer vision systems. Many of these systems are now being integrated into China's domestic surveillance network and Social Credit System, which aims to monitor and, based on social behavior, “grade” every Chinese citizen by 2021.
China is researching various types of air, land, sea, and undersea autonomous vehicles. In the spring of 2017, a civilian Chinese university with ties to the military demonstrated an AI-enabled swarm of 1,000 uninhabited aerial vehicles at an airshow. A media report released after the fact showed a computer simulation of a similar swarm formation finding and destroying a missile launcher.:23 Open-source publications indicate that China is also developing a suite of AI tools for cyber operations.:27 
Chinese development of military AI is influenced in large part by China's observation of U.S. plans for defense innovation and fears of a widening “generational gap” in comparison to the U.S. military. Similar to U.S. military concepts, the Chinese aim to use AI for exploiting large troves of intelligence, generating a common operating picture, and accelerating battlefield decision-making.:12-14
China's management of its AI ecosystem contrasts with that of the United States.:6 In general, few boundaries exist between Chinese commercial companies, university research laboratories, the military, and the central government. As a result, the Chinese government has a direct means of guiding AI development priorities and accessing technology that was ostensibly developed for civilian purposes. To further strengthen these ties, the Chinese government created in January 2017 a Military-Civil Fusion Development Commission, which is intended to speed the transfer of AI technology from commercial companies and research institutions to the military.:19 In addition, the Chinese government is leveraging both lower barriers to data collection and lower costs to data labeling to create the large databases on which AI systems train. According to one estimate, China is on track to possess 20% of the world's share of data by 2020, with the potential to have over 30% by 2030.:12
China's centrally directed effort is investing in the U.S. AI market, in companies working on militarily relevant AI applications, potentially granting it lawful access to U.S. technology and intellectual property. Chinese venture capital investment in U.S. AI companies between 2010 and 2017 totalled an estimated $1.3 billion.
Although Peking University introduced in 2004 the first academic course on AI which led other Chinese universities to adopt AI as a discipline, China faces challenges in recruiting and retaining AI engineers and researchers. Over half of the data scientists in the United States have been working in the field for over 10 years, while roughly the same proportion of data scientists in China have less than 5 years of experience. As of 2017, fewer than 30 Chinese universities produce AI-focused experts and research products.:8 Although China surpassed the United States in the quantity of research papers produced from 2011 to 2015, the quality of its published papers, as judged by peer citations, ranked 34th globally. China is, however, making efforts to address these deficiencies, with a particular focus on the development of military AI applications. Indeed, the Beijing Institute of Technology, one of China's premier institutes for weapons research, recently established the first children's educational programme in military AI in the world.
Notable companies.
Leading AI-centric companies and start-ups include Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba, SenseTime and Yitu Technology. Chinese AI companies iFlytek, SenseTime, Cloudwalk and DJI have received attention for facial recognition, sound recognition and drone technologies.
Reception.
An article published by the Center for a New American Security concluded that "Chinese government officials demonstrated remarkably keen understanding of the issues surrounding AI and international security...this includes knowledge of U.S. AI policy discussions." and recommended that "the U.S. policymaking community similarly prioritize cultivating expertise and understanding of AI developments in China" and "funding, focus, and a willingness among U.S. policymakers to drive large-scale necessary change." An article in the MIT Technology Review similarly concluded: "China might have unparalleled resources and enormous untapped potential, but the West has world-leading expertise and a strong research culture. Rather than worry about China’s progress, it would be wise for Western nations to focus on their existing strengths, investing heavily in research and education."
Some experts believe that China's intent to be the first to develop military AI applications may result in comparatively less safe applications, as China will likely be more risk-acceptant throughout the development process. These experts stated that it would be unethical for the U.S. military to sacrifice safety standards for the sake of external time pressures, but that the United States’ more conservative approach to AI development may result in more capable systems in the long run.:23

London Bridge (natural arch)

London Bridge is a natural arch on the coast of Torquay in Devon, England.
Etymology.
London Bridge has been so called for centuries.
In 1832, the writer Octavian Blewitt wrote in his "Panorama of Torquay" that London Bridge was an “absurd appellation”.
Description.
London Bridge is situated to the East of Torquay, beside an abandoned limestone quarry, and below the South West Coast Path. It can be reached by a short diversion from the trail which leads down to the arch through woodland. London Bridge can also be seen from a viewpoint above the abandoned Dyer's Quarry on the coast path, and from numerous locations around Torquay.
History.
The arch was popular with visitors in the past, particularly in the 19th century. During that period and thereafter it has been depicted in numerous works of art.
Recreation.
London Bridge is a popular climbing crag, and is a well-known venue for deep water soloing.
The arch and the area in the vicinity including the long abandoned Dyer's Quarry is a location well-liked for coasteering, due to its secluded location close to Torquay, and there are many possible jumps, some of which are said to be the best in the area.
There is also a scuba diving spot nearby, called 'The Pipes', which is so named as there is a collection of pipes spilled from the wreck of a barge which rests nearby on the seabed. It is noted to be an ideal site for trainee divers.
Ballan wrasse, conger eel and other fish are also in abundance near the arch and fishing hobbyists take advantage of this.

History.
In the 30s it was called Pooseepahtuck Club. Which was named after Poospatuck Native Americans in New York. In the 1930s Joe Jordan was the house pianist, and Monette Moore was a featured vocalist.
In the 40s the club was owned by Luckey Roberts a well known Harlem pianist and composer. He was one of the first Ragtime composers. Luckey Roberts along with James P. Johnson were developers of the stride piano style in 1919. In his later years Luckey Roberts did recordings with Willie "The Lion" Smith, and honky tonk-style piano solos with clarinetist Garvin Bushell.
Luckey Roberts is known for introducing George Gershwin to Jazz. Roberts had close ties to the Duke of Windsor. The Duke of Windsor later became the King of England. During the Duke of Windsor's 1917 trip to the United States he met Luckey. Roberts performed for 17 nights in honor of the Duke. Luckey became the Duke's mentor teaching him rhythms and supplying him with records and sheet music.
In the 50s the club was called Pink Angel and owned by Lillian Lampkin. She was the mother of the current owner Vincent Lampkin.
It became St. Nick’s in the 1960s.
It was known for decades for its late night jazz sessions where some of the best musicians in the area would come to jam. A historic jazz spot in Sugar Hill, Manhattan Harlem. It is legendary for over 50 years.
In the 50s it was renamed Pink Angel. In the 60s it was renamed St Nick's Pub. Many notable musicians, artists, and singers played at St. Nick's Pub over the 50 years, such as; Miles Davis, Billie Holiday, Lena Horne.

Northumberland County Historical Society

The Northumberland County Historical Society is a Pennsylvania nonprofit organization, which was chartered on October 26, 1925 and incorporated on May 21, 1998. Its leaders, members and volunteers are dedicated to the collection, preservation and exhibition of artifacts, documents, photographs, and other items which tell the story of Northumberland County, Pennsylvania and its people.
Headquartered at the Hunter House Museum at historic Fort Augusta in Pennsylvania's upper Susquehanna Valley, the Historical Society is also home to the Charlotte Darrah Walter Genealogical Library, and presents programs on topics of interest to historians, genealogists and members of the general public at various times during each calendar year. The facilities, which are open from March through December (but closed during the winter months), are physically located at 1150 North Front Street in Sunbury, Pennsylvania.
Charlotte Darrah Walter Genealogical Library.
The Charlotte Darrah Walter Genealogical Library houses materials from the time of the region's earliest settlers to the present, including biographical sketches and books published about Northumberland County families; birth, marriage, death, and cemetery records; baptismal, confirmation, burial, and other church records; historic newspapers and vintage photographs; and land deeds, tax rolls, wills, and other county records, etc.
Hunter House Museum.
During the early 1930s, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania took steps to preserve historic Fort Augusta and its surrounding lands through a series of preservation initiatives. Initially purchasing, in 1930, a tract of land where the original powder magazine and well of Fort Augusta were located, state officials then also purchased, in 1931, the historic Hunter House, which had been completed in 1852 by Captain Samuel Hunter, a grandson of Fort Augusta's commandant, Colonel Sam Hunter. Those properties were then acquired by the Northumberland County Historical Society, Inc. from the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in 2004.
According to historian Margaret Murray Thorell, Ph.D., when the Hunter House became the headquarters for the Northumberland County Historical Society in 1987, "an extensive renovation restored the brick house [Hunter House] to its original 1848 appearance and added meeting space at the rear of the structure."
The holdings at Hunter House Museum include that original powder magazine from Fort Augusta, as well as Native American and Moravian blacksmith artifacts, the uniform and drum of John Boulton Young, a drummer boy who died at the age of 13 while serving with the 47th Pennsylvania Infantry during the U.S. Civil War, and other items of historic interest which were uncovered during archaeological digs in 1937-1938, 1978-1979, and 1981.
A model of Fort Augusta was built on the front lawn of the Hunter House Museum and dedicated in 2013. It is roughly one-sixth of the size of the original fort, which was built in 1756 to protect settlers during the French and Indian War.
Education and outreach.
The society has historically sponsored educational outreach initiatives through an annual series of meetings and other special events. Topics addressed have included:
Historic preservation.
In addition to preservation of the Hunter House (see above), society members also collaborate with other organizations to advocate for and ensure the preservation of historic structures across the county. In 2015, society joined with the Old Towne Neighborhood Council in fighting to save the Northumberland County Prison (Pennsylvania), a 139-year-old castle-like structure which had recently been devastated by a major fire.
Publications.
Over the years, the Northumberland County Historical Society has partnered with historians and genealogists to produce books, pamphlets and other educational materials, including:
In addition, past editions of "NCHS Proceedings", a journal produced by the Northumberland County Historical Society, offer historians and family history researchers the opportunity to explore the region's history from the Native Americans of Shamokin to Early German and Hessian settlers and Revolutionary War and Civil War soldiers, as well as the contributions made by Thomas Edison to the region's development.

Chen Mingyuan

Chen Mingyuan (, born January 5, 1941, Shanghai, China) is a Chinese scholar who works in various disciplines such as linguistics, mathematics, informatics, computer sciences, and modern poetry. On April 23, 1989, Chen gave a speech at Peking University, expressing his support for the student movements and criticisms of the government. This speech was considered a trigger for the later escalation of the student movement in 1989.
Early life.
Chen was born on January 5, 1941, in Shanghai. Chen graduated from Shanghai Middle School in 1958, and then earned his mathematics degree at ShanghaiTech University in 1963. Chen also formed a cross-age friendship in his adolescence with the prominent scholar and poet, Guo Moruo because of their shared interests in poetry writing. Later, he studied Chinese linguistics at Peking University. In 1978, he was assigned a position at the Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences ("Zhongguo kexueyuan shengxue yanjiusuo") as an associate researcher. In 1982, Chen became a professor in the department of linguistics in Beijing Language and Culture College (currently Beijing Language and Culture University). His book "The Economic Life of Liberators" ("Heyi weisheng: Wenhuamingren de jingji beijing" ) was considered the best published work on the economic status of such prominent scholars such as Lu Xun, Kang Youwei, and Cai Yuanpei.
Chen was accused of being a counterrevolutionary activist during the Cultural Revolution because his poetry style was similar to that of Mao Zedong. Chen then wrote a letter to the government explaining himself, and Zhou Enlai and Zhu De both agreed that charge could be dismissed if Mao was willing to be lenient. However, Mao refused to comment. Thus, Chen was imprisoned twice during the Cultural Revolution. He was released after the death of Mao. The government officially rehabilitated Chen in 1978.
During the protests.
Chen openly supported the student protests in 1989. When students became hesitant to continue their protests after mourning the death of Hu Yaobang, Chen encouraged them not to give up, but to continue their actions. On April 23, 1989, Chen gave an emotional speech at the Triangle in Peking University to the students.
In his speech, Chen stated that intellectuals and students must not stay silent but speak out. First of all, Chen criticized the official mouthpieces such as China Central Television (CCTV) which falsely labelled the student protests as being anti-government in nature. Chen argued that the demonstration, petition, and the mourning for Hu Yaobang were spontaneous actions and there were no "black hands" behind them. Thus, Chen described CCTV as the shameless mouthpiece of the government, who had lost their consciences and had lied to the public for decades. Furthermore, Chen argued that social problems such as inflation, profiteering businesses, insufficient educational funds, and wealth polarization were caused by the immoral and corrupted officials and their relatives. The government restricted freedom of speech and democracy because officials feared their scandals would be exposed. To conclude, Chen encouraged students to continue their actions such as boycotting classes and participating demonstrations and to refuse comprise with the government. At the very end of his speech, he shouted the slogan "give us liberty or give us death" and "long live students" to the protestors. According to Chai Ling's memoir, Chen's speech was "interrupted many times by thunderous applause."
During his speech, Chen compared himself to Wen Yiduo, a scholar who was assassinated by the Kuomintang secret agencies because of his anti-government speech during the Chinese Civil War in 1946. As Chen said: “I will be responsible for every word I said, and I am not afraid of any possible consequence including death. I am already forty-eight years old now, I am luckier than Mr. Wen who had sacrificed his life when he was forty-seven."
Chen's speech was recorded and later disseminated to all major universities in Beijing and other cities as well. Wang Dan, one prominent student leader, recalled that students' confidence and motivation were restored after hearing Chen's expressive speech. Student leaders such as Liu Gang hoped other prominent scholars would also give similar speeches to students, but most scholars rejected the request and thought that Chen was too radical. Fang Lizhi, another famous scholar in Beijing, consistently warned Liu against the radicalization of students by speakers and scholars like Chen, or else some unwanted consequences might occur .
After the protest.
Chen was arrested after the crackdown on the student protests, and was detained in Qincheng Prison, a maximum-security prison in Changping, Beijing, with other dissenters including Liu Xiaobo and Liu Gang. According to Liu Gang's memoir, Chen pretended to be mentally ill and declared that all his wrong behaviors had been caused by his uncontrollable madness. Chen was eventually released, but the length of his sentence and the time of his release remain unknown.
Guo Moruo's son, Guo Pingying, sued against Chen in 1997 because Chen called himself the co-author of "Xin Chao", a collection of modern poems translated and written by Guo Moruo. Three former secretaries of Guo Moruo testified that there was no collaboration between Guo and Chen for this book. Chen lost the case and abandoned his appeal in June 1997. In 2008, Chen criticized a prominent scholar of Chinese linguistics and cultures, Yu Qiuyu by arguing that Yu misused the concepts of culture and civilization to justify his pseudo-proposition that Chinese culture was the only continuous culture in the world in the last 3,000 years.

Churin Group

Churin Group or Qiulin Group () is the largest department store in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang Province, China. Established in 1867, the company has a history of over 150 years.
History.
Qiulin Group's history went back to 1867 when Ivan Yakovlevich Churin (October 16, 1833 - April 30, 1895), a Russian who was born in Irkutsk, opened a store in Nikolayevsk-on-Amur. In 1882, he established Churin &amp; Co. () in Khabarovsk in 1882.
As the Chinese Eastern Railway was completed in 1904, Churin expanded his business to Harbin with the same name (). The current building of the company's department store is from 1904. Later his business further expanded to Lushun and Yingkou.
After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Churin moved its headquarters to Harbin in 1923, and established its branches in Dalian, Mukden, Changchun, Siping, Jilin, Heihe and Hailar during the 1930s. It, however, became controlled by Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank in 1937, and was under Japanese management in 1941.
After the Second World War, Churin was owned by the Soviet Union in 1947, and was returned to China in 1953. During the Cultural Revolution its name was changed to "The East Is Red" Department Store, but was changed to its original name in 1984. Qiulin Group was registered in the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 1996, and was acquired by Dalian's Dashang Group in the same year.
Transportation.

Wounds (film)

Wounds is a 2019 psychological horror film written and directed by Babak Anvari, in his English language debut, and starring Armie Hammer, Dakota Johnson, and Zazie Beetz. The film is based on the novella "The Visible Filth" by Nathan Ballingrud.
The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2019, and was released in the United States on October 18, 2019, by Hulu and internationally on Netflix.
Plot.
Will is a New Orleans-based bartender who works at a run-down cockroach-infested bar. One evening, Alicia (one of his exes), her (current) boyfriend Jeffrey, a drunk Eric, and a group of college kids enter the bar. Eric gets into a fight with another guest, resulting in Eric being stabbed in the cheek with a broken bottle. The kids leave the bar in a panic and Will discovers one of them has left their phone behind. Will returns to his house, which he shares with his student girlfriend Carrie. While inspecting the phone, he receives messages from someone called Garrett, who claims that he is scared and something from the "tunnel" is following him.
The next morning, Will awakens to discover that overnight, Garrett has sent the phone a photo that shows a pile of bloody teeth. Carrie insists they call the police. Will drops Carrie off at school, where he suspects her professor is sleeping with her. He then visits Eric. Eric's wound is now infected, and he claims he is suffering from nightmares. Will spots some sort of inhuman flesh in Eric's wound. He visits Alicia and it is revealed that he has a crush on her and envies Jeffrey. Returning home, Will doesn't notice one of the college kids following him around town. He discovers photos and videos on the phone of a corpse and decapitated head being surrounded by cockroaches. Carrie sees the footage and forces Will to hand it over to the police. She discovers a book in one of the photos entitled "The Translation of Wounds". They call Garrett and hear an inhuman screeching on the other end.
While driving to the station, Will spots one of the college kids following him and receives messages from another member of the group, stating that he "has been chosen". Will hallucinates the phone turning into a cockroach creature and throws it out the car window, where it is picked up by one of the kids. Without the phone, the police cannot do anything. Will and Alicia later hang and make out before Alicia stops, feeling guilty. Will receives strange texts from Carrie and discovers her at home, staring at a strange video of a tunnel in a trance. Carrie has no memory of sending Will the texts. Later that night, Will awakens to discover Garrett in the house. Garrett throws up a pile of teeth before claiming he and his friends summoned "something", that it possessed them and Will has now brought it into his own home: it now sees him as "the perfect vessel for more".
Will hallucinates a cockroach crawling out of a wound in his armpit. Will and Carrie start to get more distant and aggressive to one another. He discovers she has been searching for Garrett online, as well as the books she noticed in the photo and Gnostic rituals which state that a wound is a portal for higher beings to enter the world. At work, Will gets more and more erratic and starts a fight with Jeffrey. He receives another text from Carrie, claiming someone is in the house with her. Will rushes home and discovers her in a trance again. She is in a catatonic state that does not stop until she is bathed, which results in a strange dark liquid washing off her. The next day, she and Will break up, with Carrie accusing Will of being empty.
Will goes to work and snaps at his boss, resulting in him quitting, while Alicia tells him to stop calling her. Broken and alone, Will decides to stay at Eric's house. Eric's wound has worsened. He reveals the college kids forced him to lure Will to the house, and they asked him to give Will "a present". Will spots an eye looking at him through Eric's wound. He discovers the phone in Eric's possession and is prompted to accept the "present" wrapped in flesh. He realizes the higher being the kids summoned is inside Eric's wound. After calling Garrett again, which fills the room with the inhuman screeching, a swarm of cockroaches arrive. Will finally submits and starts to absorb the higher being in an attempt to become whole as cockroaches envelop the house.

8th Day (song)

"8th Day" is a song written and recorded by Canadian country music artist Dean Brody for his sixth studio album, "Beautiful Freakshow" (2016). The song was co-written and produced by Matt Rovey. It was released to Canadian country radio November 1, 2017 as the album's fifth single. In March 2018, the song became Brody's third number-one on the Canada Country airplay chart.
Content.
"8th Day" is a traditional-leaning country song with lyrics that celebrate farmers and country girls. Inspired by the biblical passage outlining what God created on the first days of existence, the song "pays homage to strong, confident and sometimes-complicated women who were finely crafted to be in this world." Its celebratory nature has been compared to that of Brody's first chart-topper, "Canadian Girls" (2012).
Release and promotion.
"8th Day" was released to radio on November 1, 2017. The following week, November 8, was dubbed "National Country Girls Day." Fans were encouraged to share stories of the country girls in their life to social media using the pseudo-holiday as a hashtag as part of a week-long promotional campaign to win a signed poster from Brody.
Charts.
"8th Day" reached number one on the Canada Country chart dated March 3, 2018. This earned Brody his third number one on the chart, and first since "Bounty" reached the summit in 2013.

Holocaust Museum in Odessa

Museum of the Holocaust – victims of fascism, Odessa () – the first Museum in Ukraine, which is based on the events of the genocide of the Jewish population in Transnistria Governorate (the territories which were from 1941 to 1943 under jurisdiction of Romania and occupied Odessa, Mykolaiv and part of Vinnytsia areas).
History.
In 1995, the idea arose to create a museum of the Holocaust in Odessa. It was proposed by two former prisoners of the ghetto and concentration camps: President of the Association "Ukraine-Israel" and former prisoner of the concentration camp in Domanivka Dmitry Gutakhov, and former prisoner of fascism Nilva Efim.
Fourteen years later, by the decision of the Council of Odessa regional Association of Jews—former prisoners of ghettos and Nazi concentration camps (Chairman of the Association – Shvartsman Roman Markovich), the museum officially opened on 22 June 2009.
On the opening day of the Museum, the head of the society "Ukraine – Israel" Dmitry Gutakhov, in his speech noted:
The opening date of the Museum is symbolic. On 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union. Blitzkrieg on the eastern front was not only about instant military victory, it was also (if not mostly) about genocide and war crimes. Nazi Germany wanted to kill or enslave all of the Soviet Union's population, just like they were (trying) to do in Poland since 1 September 1939. Terrible war crimes were committed by both the SS groups just like the Wehrmacht. All Slavic, Roma, Jewish (hated the most by Nazis) and other people were considered by brainwashed Germans as subhumans, hence undeserving of rights and dignity. Those who could not work for their "masters" from "master Aryan race" (Germans) and become their slaves were to be exterminated.
By decision of the Council of the Odessa Regional Association of Jews-former prisoners of the ghetto and Nazi concentration camps, Sabulis Victor Franzevich was appointed the first director of the museum.
On the eve of the opening of the museum Roman Markovich Shvartsman said:
Exhibits and Exposition.
Initially in two halls of the museum about one and a half thousand exhibits were exposed: photos, documents, tablets and exhibits – witnesses of that time, a large part from which is taken from private collections of the Odessa Jews brought by former prisoners.
A significant part of the exposition was transferred to the museum from Chicago, US, now the late native of Odessa, former prisoner of the ghetto Lev Dumer.
All exhibits are genuine, dedicated to Odessa citizens – former prisoners of concentration camps and ghettos, 400 of whom were lucky enough to survive the nightmares of the Holocaust. These are graphic images, photographs, and relics, and photo documents about the horrors experienced during the Second World War by Jewish residents of Odessa and the region. One particularly painful exhibit is the rope with which the Nazis hanged a young girl. It was given to the museum by a man who, at that time, a boy, was in love with that girl.
Today, the Holocaust Museum is a two-story complex, which houses a research library, a training center and a memorial space.
Exhibits.
Initially, the exhibition gives an overview of the Holocaust, and then focuses on the fate of the Jews of Odessa and Transnistria. In addition to the permanent exhibition, the museum offers audio and video interviews, a library and a memorial room.
The permanent exhibition covers five halls of the Museum.
Exposition.
The Museum also presents traveling exhibitions, where you can see Romanian, Roma, Bulgarian Jews, former prisoners of ghettos and concentration camps.
By the 75th anniversary of the occupation of Odessa during the Second World War, the Holocaust museum presented the exhibition "Documents of the Romanian occupation of Odessa 1941–1944 from the state archives of Odessa region".
In January 2012, the international day of commemoration in memory of the victims of the Holocaust saw the opening of an exhibition of photographs entitled "Holocaust in granite". The photographs reveal the tragedy of the Holocaust. The exhibition is devoted to the tragic fate of the Jews of Odessa, Bessarabia and Bukovina, destroyed by the Romanian occupiers in 1941–1944 on the territory between the Southern Bug and the Dniester. The photos, which formed the basis of the exhibition, were taken from expeditions carried out in the period from 2011 to 2012. The expeditions are part of a major long-term project launched by the Odessa Holocaust Museum.
In 2017 the mini-diorama "Ghetto in Transnistria" appeared in the museum's collection. It depicts a Jewish ghetto in the Odessa settlement, which was established by the occupiers in 1942. In it are almost 90 figures at 1/35th scale. The author of this project was the Odessa master-modeler Evgeniy Kapuka.
In 2018 the museum presented the exhibition "Priests and Holocaust", dedicated to those who opposed totalitarian regimes and mass crimes in the 20th and 21st centuries.
Goals and objectives of the museum.
The organizers of the museum set the main goal in the work of the museum: to collect, preserve and communicate to future generations the story of this unprecedented tragedy, to preserve the memory of those who suffered, to educate a new generation of young people who will be able to resist and prevent the emergence of fascism in the 21st century.
In his speech, Eduard Dolinsky, Director General of the Jewish Committee of Ukraine, noted:
Chairman of the Association of former prisoners of concentration camps and ghettos Roman Shvartsman said:
Today, the Museum presents a fairly large collection of exhibits.
Since its opening, the Museum has been visited by more than 20 thousand people from around the world: ambassadors, diplomats, heads of cities and regions, students and schoolchildren, and people who remember or want to learn about the terrible tragedy that is called the Holocaust.
Museum today.
The author of the project of the information and historical reference book "Geography of the Holocaust", candidate of Philosophy, director of the Odessa Holocaust museum Pavel Efimovich Kozlenko remarked:
Today, the Museum has a new concept, the most convenient and understandable for visitors, created by Pavel Kozlenko, with the help of the Odessa regional Association of Jews—former prisoners of the ghetto and Nazi concentration camps.
The Museum also collaborates with the Institute for the study of the Holocaust. Elie Wiesel (Romania).

Belgrade Design Week

Belgrade Design Week is an international festival established in 2005, and held once a year in Belgrade, Serbia. The week-long conference is organized every spring and is the largest design initiative in South Eastern Europe. It covers architecture, design, fashion, publishing, and new media, as well as related fields like communications, marketing, advertising, and arts management. The event includes design labs, competitions, and presentations from international speakers like Karim Rashid and Daniel Libeskind.
During the rest of the year, there are related projects such as promoting local designers, holding a branding competition for the Serbian Center for the Promotion of Science, and participating in the Partners of the Human Cities/ Project. The organization also spearheaded the Belgrade 2020 project, promoting the city as a candidate for the European Capital of Culture.
History.
First held in 2005, Belgrade Design Week festival was founded by brand consultant Jovan Jelovac, a formally trained architect. The conference costs about half a million euros to produce and is supported mostly through commercial and media sponsorships. For Jelovac, education was the primary reason for launching the summit, as well as inspiring the country's citizens through design. In 2014, the president of Serbia, Tomislav Nikolić, presided over the event, mentioning how design can contribute to the country's economy.
In 2006, designer Karim Rashid was the ambassador for the second Belgrade Design Week and spoke at the conference. As a result, he later headed several design projects in Serbia's capital city. Rashid stated that he is fascinated by Belgrade and Eastern Europe in general, seeing it "as the next upcoming place - everyone is psyched and enthusiastic about the rebuilding of these poetic, romantic, artistic and very intellectual places."
After attending the design festival in 2008, architect Daniel Libeskind left with a billion dollar, albeit controversial, commission to redevelop the Belgrade waterfront. Major projects like this one are contributing to the renewal of the city. Other skyscrapers and shopping malls are in the planning stages, and architectural masterpieces, like the Art Nouveau "Geozavod" building, are being restored. Belgrade is being compared to 1990's Berlin, seen as a decaying but alive metropolis: "Recently, the gritty city has emerged as an outpost of creative activity and urban cool on the cheap, against the lingering backdrop of socialism."
About.
The principal site of the festival changes annually with various run-down or abandoned buildings being renovated for the event. Past locations have included a palace, the bombed out hotel Jugoslavija, an abandoned department store, the closed contemporary art museum, and an old factory. Every year, the conference also focuses on a common thread, for example, in 2013 the unifying theme was the square shape.
Approximately thirty international speakers present each year and cover a wide range of subjects, helping to promote cultural exchanges between Serbia and the rest of the world. Notable designers and artists who have spoken at the event include Konstantin Grcic, Aylin Langreuter, Christophe de la Fontaine, Hella Jongerius, Daan Roosegaarde, Ross Lovegrove. Christophe Pillet, Sacha Lakic and Patricia Urquiola.
In addition to the presentations, there are numerous workshops and design competitions, as well as exhibits from designers such as Israeli Eilon Armon and Swiss architect duo Lang/Baumann.

Gritsovsky

Gritsovsky () is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) in Venyovsky District of Tula Oblast, Russia, located north of Venyov, the administrative center of the district, and north of Novomoskovsk. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 6,192.
History.
It was founded in 1954 as a village to house the miners at the Gryzlov lignite mine. Its name derives from that of the Gritsovo railway station which lies to the east. In 1965, Gritsovsky was granted urban-type settlement status.
Gritsovsky reached its peak population of about 9,000 before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Subsequently, the mines were privatized, followed by decreased demand for lignite, with the result that the last mine in the area closed in 2009.
A regional hospital was built in Gritsovsky in 1995, and in the 2000s a refrigerator factory (PZH, Podolsk) was built.
Administrative and municipal status.
Within the framework of administrative divisions, the urban-type settlement of Gritsovsky is incorporated within Venyovsky District as Venyovsky Urban-Type Settlement. As a municipal division, Gritsovsky Urban-Type Settlement is incorporated within Venyovsky Municipal District as Gritsovsky Urban Settlement.

Brachyanax

Brachyanax is a genus of bee fly in the subfamily Anthracinae. It was circumscribed by Neal Evenhuis in 1981. Thirteen species are recognized, and they are found in Asia and Australasia.
Taxonomic history.
The American entomologist Neal Evenhuis created the genus in a 1981 paper in "Pacific Insects". His initial circumscription included eleven species. Four species had first been described in the genus "Anthrax"; Evenhuis described the other seven species in his initial circumscription. Evenhuis and Junichi Yukawa described an additional new species in 1986. Further changes to the list of species in "Brachyanax" occurred in 1988 and 1999.
The generic name "Brachyanax" comes from the Greek ("brakhús"; "small, short") and ("ánax"; "lord, master, general-in-chief"). The specific epithet of the type species, "thelestrephones", comes from the Greek ("thēlḗ"; "nipple") and ("stréphō"; "twist"). This led to the American entomologist Arnold Menke including "Brachyanax thelestrephones" in his 1993 list "Funny or Curious Zoological Names"; Menke translated the binomen as "little chief nipple twister". Subsequent discussions of interesting taxonomic names have also included this binomen, using the same translation. The species "B. thelestrephones" became recognized as a junior synonym of "B. satellitius" in 1999. However, following the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the type species of the genus remains "Brachyanax thelestrephones".
Phylogeny.
When Evenhuis circumscribed "Brachyanax", he wrote this genus was between the tribes Anthracini and Exoprosopini although more similar to the former. Evenhuis and other dipterists have subsequently continued to place "Brachyanax" in Anthracini. The other genera placed in Anthracini are: "Anthrax", "Dicranoclista", "Satyramoeba", "Spogostylum", "Thraxan", "Turkmeniella", "Walkeromyia", and "Xenox".
Distribution.
"Brachyanax" species are found in the Australasian/Oceanian realm (Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Bonin Islands), the Oriental realm (Indonesia, Philippines, Laos, India, Malaysia, Singapore, possibly China), and the Palearctic realm (Japan, possibly China).
Description.
Males and females in the genus "Brachyanax" are morphologically the same except with respect to genitalia. Their body length is and their wingspan is . The head is either as wide as or narrower than the thorax; the abdomen is slightly narrower than the thorax.
"Brachyanax" species have distinctive antennae: the pedicel, or second segment, is "spherically cone-shaped" and the base of the third segment, or flagellum, is rather enlarged and bulbous.
The wing venation is also distinctive: the radial vein R originates near the r-m crossvein and gently curves 90° to the wing's margin. The radial veins R and R both lack an appendix, or spur-vein, at their base. The anal cell, or cell cup, is closed, typically with a short stalk. The basal portion of the wing is an opaque dark brown; this can cover one-third to four-fifths of each wing's area. The remainder of the wing is colourless and transparent. Its squamae and squamal fringe are brown to dark brown.
Species.
In 2015, Evenhuis and D. J. Greathead recognized the following thirteen species in "Brachyanax":

Len Forden

Leonard Forden (1910 – 5 March 1977) was a British trade unionist. He served on both the General Council of the Trades Union Congress and the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party.
Forden worked for many years as a bus driver in Manchester. He joined the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU) in 1924, and became secretary of his union branch in 1943. In 1949, he was elected to the General Executive Council of the TGWU, and he served as vice-chairman and then, from 1960, as chairman of the council and president of the union.
In 1958, Forden was elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), despite still working on the buses, it being a tradition of the TGWU that one their nominees would not work full time for the union. He served until 1964, when he agreed to stand down, in order that Frank Cousins could take his place. He instead won election to the General Purposes Committee of the TUC.
Forden was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party in 1968, replacing Harry Nicholas, who had been appointed as General Secretary of the Labour Party. While on the body, he chaired the party's Staff Negotiations Committee.
Forden also served as a delegate to the International Transport Workers' Federation and the Manchester and Salford Trades Council. From 1960, he served on the National Advisory Council on the Employment of the Disabled. In his spare time, he was a magistrate.
Forden retired from his posts in 1975, and died two years later.

James Baker House (Burkesville, Kentucky)

The James Baker House near Burkesville, Kentucky is a Federal-style building built in 1820. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.
It is located on Kentucky Route 61.
The house was deemed notable for its "demonstrating how Virginia served as a source area for architectural ideas in this part of Kentucky, which was still being settled in 1820, the year of the house's construction. This house is typical of mid-18th-century Virginia vernacular housing, and gives insight to the continued influence of the English settlements on the pioneers relocating to the West. The Flemish Bond exterior and the elaborate detail of the Federal style interior were found in Kentucky's highly designed homes in 1820. This house may have been an effort by wealthy rural residents to convey their social status through fashionable architectural style, while at the same time retaining a traditional hall and parlor plan that was deemed serviceable for that period. The design reveals how 18th-century Virginia spatial design and exterior treatments have served well into 20 -, and now 21 -century Kentucky."

The first player to hit the landmark was Raúl, who did so in February 2006 while the most recent member of the "100 club" is Pepe, who played his 100th match in October 2020. The player with the most appearances is Cristiano Ronaldo, who has played 178 times in the Champions League.
Five players scored in their 100th appearance: Thierry Henry (for Barcelona against Sporting CP) on 26 November 2008, Zlatan Ibrahimović (for Paris Saint-Germain against Olympiacos) on 27 November 2013, Cristiano Ronaldo (for Real Madrid against Borussia Dortmund) on 2 April 2014, Andrea Pirlo (for Juventus against Olympiacos) on 4 November 2014, and Toni Kroos (for Real Madrid against Galatasaray) on 22 October 2019.

List of unproduced DC Comics projects

This is a list of unmade and unreleased projects by DC Comics. Some of these productions were, or still are, in "development hell" in other mediums.
Batman.
Fleischer Studios' "Batman".
Following the success of the Fleischer "Superman" cartoons, Fleischer Studios communicated with DC Comics over the possibility of adapting Batman. The communication got to the point of budget discussions as illustrated in a letter dated January 25, 1942, and reproduced in longtime Batman executive producer, Michael E. Uslan's 2011 memoir, "The Boy Who Loved Batman." It is, however, unknown how far the production of this project went before being abandoned.
CBS' Mike Henry Batman.
Prior to the 1966 juggernaut that was the Adam West/Burt Ward "Batman" series, CBS attempted to launch a live action children's program based on the character. Former Rams linebacker and Tarzan actor Mike Henry was soon approached to appear as the character and even took publicity stills. The project went into limbo, and after a long stagnation, producers attempted to ironically sell it to NBC; they passed on the project in 1965.
"Batman vs. Godzilla".
The original idea for this seemingly mismatched crossover comes from the hand of series writer Shinichi Sekizawa, who submitted a manuscript of the proposal in November 1965. Sekizawa's concept featured several characters from the Batman universe, including Robin and Commissioner Gordon. To actually battle the King of the Monsters, Batman and his sidekicks would have utilized several vehicles to engage in combat, including the Batmobile, the Batcopter, and the Batcycle. Interesting to note, the concept also featured the introduction of a weather control apparatus, an idea which would later be worked into the script for "Son of Godzilla" (1967). It also was going to have another device to control Godzilla himself, which would possibly indicate another antagonist pitting the two characters against each other.
In terms of Sekizawa's motivation, his reasoning seems clear in these drafts: to try and repeat the mammoth international success that the crossover film "King Kong vs. Godzilla" (1962) enjoyed. This is made apparent in allusions to the earlier 1962 film, as even this extremely early take at the concept included mention of Godzilla's battle with King Kong, which was noted as being included with stock footage of the two titans fighting.
Not surprisingly, though, the concept never got far enough for a full-fledged script to have been created. There are many questions related to the proposal still unknown as well, such as if DC Comics was ever actually approached with the idea or not. It is also not known to what degree the then-recent "Batman" TV series, which debuted two months after Sekizawa proposed this idea, might have played, if any. It is also interesting to note that references to "Batgirl" are made in the concept, which would predate the Barbara Gordon version of the character that would later become synonymous with the name in 1966.
Tim Burton "Batman Continues".
During the early development of the cancelled "Catwoman" spin-off, Burton expressed his interest in directing the third installment of the "Batman" film series that began with "Batman" in 1989. The Monkees lead drummer Micky Dolenz was attached to star as the Riddler, the film's main antagonist. Also, Harvey Dent's transformation into Two-Face was supposed to occur in the film, with Billy Dee Williams reprising his role as Dent from the first film, after turning down the offer to appear in "Batman Returns". Along with these, Michelle Pfeiffer was attached to return as Catwoman, Marlon Wayans was attached to star as Robin, and Rene Russo was attached to star as Dr. Chase Meridian. However, when Warner Bros. observed that the script was just as gloomy as the previous film, they decided to put Joel Schumacher as the director of the third installment, leading to the release of "Batman Forever", in which Burton served as producer, without being able to contribute ideas.
"Batman: Assault on Arkham 2".
In a 2016 interview, Jay Oliva mentioned that he had plans to make a sequel to "." But following his departure from Warner Bros. Animation, the project may have been pulled.
"Batman: The Musical".

The first is the opening theme for "Gotham City" and the entry of Batman with his tortured solo "The Graveyard Shift"; followed by "The Joker's Song (Where Does He Get All Those Wonderful Toys?)", "The Catwoman's Song (I Need All The Love I Can Get)", "We're Still the Children We Once Were" (the climactic sequence) and "In the Land of the Pig, the Butcher is King", sung by the corrupt bloodsuckers ruling Gotham; the last song mentioned here was covered on the Meat Loaf album "". After production was cancelled, these songs were released on the "Batman: The Musical" memorial site.
"Gotham High".
An animated series that reimagines Batman characters as high school students was in development in the late 2000s and early 2010s. A similar idea was used for the "DC Super Hero Girls" 2015 shorts and the 2019 animated series.
"Batman: Arkham".
After the success of "," Warner Bros. greenlighted the production of a third installment, entitled "Batman: Arkham". Boyd Kirkland, the director of this film, was attached to write and direct. The film would have Batman and Robin facing off against a collection of Arkham Asylum escapees, in addition to Batman finding himself falling in love with a new love interest, planned to be voiced by Angie Harmon. The main cast of ' was attached to reprise their roles. Steven E. Gordon also drew some art concept for the film. However, the film was cancelled in favor of ' (which also featured Harmon), while "Batman: Arkham" eventually became a successful by Rocksteady.
"The Batman vs. Hush".
A second movie of "The Batman" titled "The Batman vs. Hush" that featured Hush as the main villain along with the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, Catwoman and Clayface was planned for a long time.

"Catwoman: The Animated Series".

Tim Burton's "Catwoman" spin-off.
"Batman Returns" would be the last film in the Warner Bros. "Batman" film series that featured Burton and Michael Keaton as director and leading actor. With "Batman Forever", Warner Bros. decided to go in a "lighter" direction to be more mainstream in the process of a family film. Burton had no interest in returning to direct a sequel, but was credited as producer. With Warner Bros. moving on development for "Batman Forever" in June 1993, a "Catwoman" spin-off was announced. Michelle Pfeiffer was to reprise her role, with the character not to appear in "Forever" because of her own spin-off.
Burton became attached as director, while producer Denise Di Novi and writer Daniel Waters also returned. In January 1994, Burton was unsure of his plans to direct "Catwoman" or an adaptation of "The Fall of the House of Usher". On June 6, 1995, Waters turned in his "Catwoman" script to Warner Bros., the same day "Batman Forever" was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked, "Turning it in the day "Batman Forever" opened may not have been my best logistical move, in that it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. "Catwoman" is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script." In an August 1995 interview, Pfeiffer reiterated her interest in the spin-off, but explained her priorities would be challenged as a mother and commitments to other projects. The film labored in development hell for years, with Pfeiffer replaced by Ashley Judd. The film ended up becoming the critically panned "Catwoman" (2004), starring Halle Berry.
Untitled direct-to-video "Catwoman" film.
Around 2003, during the production of "", Warner Bros. approached Boyd Kirkland to write a Catwoman direct-to-video feature film as a tie-in with the 2004 live-action film. Although the script was written, the project was soon scrapped after the poor reception of the live action film.

"Superman III: Supergirl".
Producer Ilya Salkind originally wrote a treatment for the third installment from the "Superman" film series starring Christopher Reeve that expanded the film's scope to a cosmic scale, introducing the villains Brainiac and Mister Mxyzptlk, as well as "Supergirl". The original outline featured a father–daughter relationship between Brainiac and Supergirl and a romance between Superman and Supergirl, even though the two are cousins in the comics. Warner Bros. rejected the outline and made their own "Superman III" film.
"Superman V".
A sequel to the original "Superman" film series was in the works following "." The film was cancelled due to the fact that "Quest for Peace" was a flop.

"Who's Afraid of Diana Prince" TV pilot (1967).
A proposed 1967 television series, that only resulted in the production of a short pilot. The success of the "Batman" television series led "Batman" producer William Dozier to commission a pilot script by Stan Hart and Larry Siegel. "Batman" writer Stanley Ralph Ross was then asked to perform a re-write, after Hart and Siegel's script was deemed unsuitable. A portion of the pilot, under five minutes in length, was filmed by Greenway Productions, the company behind the "Batman" show under the title "Who's Afraid of Diana Prince?" The piece starred Ellie Wood Walker (Robert Walker Jr.'s wife) as Diana Prince, Linda Harrison as Diana's Wonder Woman alter ego and Maudie Prickett as Diana's mother. In the proposed series Diana Prince (not Wonder Woman) would have been the focus of the comedy. Diana, an awkward and rather plain young woman, lives with her mother close to a United States Air Force base. Much of the film consists of her mother berating Diana about not having a boyfriend. When her mother leaves the room, Diana changes into her Wonder Woman costume and admires her reflection in a mirror. What she sees is not Diana Prince, but rather a sexy super-heroic figure (played by Linda Harrison) who proceeds to preen and pose as the song "Oh, You Beautiful Doll" plays on the soundtrack.

Mark Pedowitz confirmed that ""Amazon" is on pause (as) the script is not exactly what we wanted, and with an iconic character like Wonder Woman, we have to get it right." In January 2014, Pedowitz told "The Hollywood Reporter" that the project was no longer in development: "We did not go forward with it [...] it all depends on the script. We were very careful with Arrow, and we're being very careful with Flash [...] these are iconic characters, so we're going to be very careful with Wonder Woman.

It's been embraced. It would be great to figure out a sequel, and if we did, and we've been trying to figure one out, it would be great to do the really dark, scary version. We got caught in that weird PG-13R no man's land, and we should do the hard-R scary version, which I would love to do."

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Arnold Schwarzenegger was attached to the title role of a "Sgt.

Screenplays were written by David Webb Peoples in 1987, Steven E. de Souza in 1988, John Milius in 1993, and Brian Helgeland in 1996, depicting Rock as having a German-American father and being able to speak German (a skill he uses to ambush the enemy).

Cox has stated that Schwarzenegger is no longer attached to star in the project.

It's really just about trying to attach cast right now and really decide what the movie is going to be, how we're going to make it". Bruce Willis was reportedly under consideration for the role. In December 2008, Guy Ritchie reported that the film has been shelved due to his work on "Sherlock Holmes," but confirmed that the "Sgt. Rock" film will indeed be set during World War II and include the members of Easy Company.

Castle of Bullas

The castle of Bullas is a castle located in Peña Rubia de Cehegín, Bullas, Murcia.
Of muslim origin, it was built between the XII and XIII centuries, before the Castillian conquest. After the Mudéjar revolt of 1264-66, it was given to the Templar Order together with the neighbouring area.
In 1286 it was entrusted to the Emirate of Granada, causing the treachery of king Sancho IV of Castile.
Later on, Fernán Pérez de Guzmán and the Knights Templar recovered it. After the abolition of the order in 1312, it belonged to the Order of Santiago.
In the XVII and XVIII centuries, the castle's stones were used for the construction of homes. Nowadays only remnants survive of the Casco Viejo.

Central American migrant caravans

Central American migrant caravans, also known as the ("Migrant's Way of the Cross"), are migrant caravans that travel from Central America to the Mexico–United States border. The largest and best known of these were organized by (Village Without Borders) that set off during Holy Week in early 2017 and 2018 from the Northern Triangle of Central America (NTCA), but such caravans of migrants began arriving several years earlier, and other unrelated caravans continued to arrive into late 2018.
There is some disagreement as to whether the migrant caravans are primarily composed of refugees seeking asylum or are merely large concentrations of traditional economic migrants. Numerous human rights organizations document the increase in violence and abuse in recent years in Central American countries. A report by the Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development, cited by Amnesty International, noted that between 2007 and 2012, several Central American countries had the highest average annual female homicide rates in the world, although the average annual male homicide rates in the world are higher. Other studies of the composition of the caravans indicated that the caravans more resemble traditional economic migrants. The causes of the migration, as well as the proper way to settle or deport the migrants themselves, remains a source of political debate within the U.S.
History.
Drought and crop failure in the Central American dry corridor and climate change in Honduras has been a factor in the formation of the caravans.
Pueblo Sin Fronteras supported its first Holy Week caravan in 2017.
On 25 March 2018, a group of about 700 migrants (80% from Honduras) began their way north from Tapachula. By 1 April, the caravan had arrived in Matías Romero, Oaxaca, and grown to about 1,200 people. In mid-April, 500 migrants continued northward from Mexico City—the caravan's last official stop—toward Tijuana, in separate groups riding atop freight train cars. Two busloads of the migrants arrived in Tijuana on 25 April and a further four busloads were making their way from Hermosillo. On 29 April 2018, after traveling across Mexico, the migrants' caravan came to an end at Friendship Park at the Mexico–United States border in Tijuana.
More than 150 migrants prepared to seek asylum from United States immigration officials. United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the caravan "a deliberate attempt to undermine our laws and overwhelm our system". On 30 April, Sessions' Justice Department announced criminal charges against eleven people for crossing the border illegally.
American aid worker Scott Warren with the organization No More Deaths was arrested on 12 May on charges of illegally harboring people in the country, hours after releasing a report accusing the U.S. Border Patrol of tampering with water sources for migrants crossing the Arizona desert. He pleaded not guilty and was ultimately acquitted in November 2019.
Crisis in Honduras.
Honduras is one of the poorest and most violent countries in Central America. The country experienced a coup d'état in 2009 and is one of the most unequal countries in the world, while the poverty rate stood at 64.3% in 2018. Drought and crop failure is also one of the causes of emigration.
According to the newspaper Le Monde, "Caught between extreme poverty and ultra-violence, more and more Hondurans are choosing to flee their country, driven by the most extreme despair". An opposition Honduran politician considers that migrants "do not run after the American dream, they flee the Honduran nightmare".
Late 2018 caravans.
Migrants from Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador gathered on 12 October to meet at San Pedro Sula, the second largest city in Honduras. The caravan began the next day, intending to reach the United States to flee from violence, poverty, and political repression. The caravan began with about 160 migrants but quickly gathered over 500 participants as it marched through Honduras. Bartolo Fuentes, a former Honduran congressman and one of the march coordinators, stated that the goal of the caravan was to find safety in numbers as it traveled north. Though he was at first convinced that the caravan was a spontaneous movement, Fuentes has since told several news agencies that the caravan was organized and popularized through a faked social media account bearing his own name and photograph, which has since been deleted from Facebook. Fuentes says he first heard about the fake account from Irineo Mujica of the organization Pueblo Sin Fronteras. The same day it left, United States Vice President Mike Pence urged the presidents of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala to persuade their citizens to stay home. Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández advised his citizens to return home and to "not let yourselves be used for political purposes". Pueblo Sin Fronteras did not organize the October caravan, but expressed its solidarity with it. Irineo Mujico, the director of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, did not himself recommend another caravan to the United States, instead advising its members to seek asylum in Mexico.
As the caravan passed through the Guatemalan city of Chiquimula, Fuentes was arrested by police and deported. Other Hondurans, traveling on buses, had their papers seized or were arrested, forcing migrants to travel on foot. On entering Tecún Umán on 18 October 2018, the caravan numbered around 5,000, but began shrinking due to the speed of parts of the caravan and its reception in shelters in Tecún Umán. The same day, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to deploy the U.S. military and close the U.S.–Mexico border to keep the caravan from entering the country. Trump also threatened to cut aid to countries allowing the caravans to pass through. Also on 18 October, Mexico flew two Boeing 727s transporting Federal Police officers to the Guatemala–Mexico border. The next day, 19 October, an estimated 4,000 migrants had gathered in Ciudad Tecún Umán in Guatemala. Mexican officials, including the ambassador to Guatemala, requested that migrants appear individually at the border for processing. The migrants ignored the request, and marched on the bridge, overwhelming Guatemalan police and Mexican barriers on the bridge, then entered Ciudad Hidalgo, Chiapas, and encountered Federal Police in riot gear. After an hour-long standoff with police, whom migrants threw shoes and stones at, tear gas was used to push the migrants back onto the bridge. Officials reported that at least six Mexican police officers had been injured. After hostilities ended, migrants formed into lines and began processing by Mexican authorities. By the mid-afternoon, migrants were allowed entry in Mexico and were taken by bus to Tapachula. According to the Commissioner of the Federal Police, , this was for processing and shelter. Migrants with valid visas and documentation were allowed immediate entrance, while asylum-seekers would be detained in a migration center for 45 days.On 20 October, about 2,000 migrants who had crossed the Suchiate River and entered Ciudad Hidalgo decided to rebuild the caravan to continue their trek to the United States. The caravan again resumed its march early on 21 October from Tapachula. A force of 700 Federal Police officers, mostly women, formed a human barricade on the Suchiate–Tapachula highway, but withdrew as the 5,000-strong caravan of migrants came within . By the afternoon, the migrants reached Tapachula and its leaders decided to rest there, inside Mexico. Their march began again the next day, bound for Huixtla, another away from Tapachula. Simultaneously, Guatemalan officials reported that another thousand migrants entered the country from Honduras, while another 1,000 migrants were reported making for Tapachula from Ciudad Hidalgo.
Irineo Mujica was arrested in Ciudad Hidalgo on 22 October while walking with a group of migrants to a church. Mujica was pulled out of a crowd of migrants by Mexican authorities and pushed into a white van. According to Pueblo Sin Fronteras, he was not involved in organizing the caravan and was conducting humanitarian work in Tapachula. Mujica has since claimed that he and Pueblo Sin Fronteras were initially opposed to the timing of this migrant caravan, because they believed it would be used to build anti-immigration sentiment during the 2018 US midterm election.
Also on 22 October, President Donald Trump said the U.S. would begin curtailing tens of millions of dollars in aid to three Central American nations, because they did not stop the caravan. President Trump also threatened to send the U.S. military to close the border and stop the caravan.On 26 October, when the caravan was in the Arriaga Municipality of the state of Chiapas, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto unveiled his program entitled "Estás en tu casa" ("You are at home"). This initiative allows caravan migrants meeting certain criteria to receive benefits and begin to normalize their immigration status in Mexico. Migrants who follow Mexican laws and are granted refugee status will, according to the plan, be entitled to temporary work permits and IDs, medical attention, housing in local establishments, and schooling for children. In order to qualify, however, migrants must agree to settle in the states of Chiapas or Oaxaca and not continue to move north.
As the second caravan entered Mexico on 30 October, the main body of some 4,000 migrants, at Santiago Niltepec, demanded "safe and dignified" transportation to Mexico City. Migrants still crossing into Mexico over the Suchiate river were dissuaded by Mexican helicopters and police.
"The fact that the first of these caravans was able to move from Honduras into Guatemala and then into Mexico is inspiring other migrants to travel in large groups, reversing the long-established logic of Central American migration to the United States: Rather than trying to travel undetected, some migrants are trading invisibility for safety in numbers."&lt;br&gt;- Kirk Semple and Elisabeth Malkin for "The New York Times", 31 October 2018 "...at least 100 were "kidnapped" (exhausted walkers were lured into vehicles) in the state of Puebla and allegedly handed over to the Zetas gang..."
Some scientists contend that the impact of climate change is causing crop failures and exacerbating poverty in Central America, thereby creating what the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has called "climate refugees." According to Robert Albro, a researcher at the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University, "The main reason people are moving is because they don’t have anything to eat. This has a strong link to climate change – we are seeing tremendous climate instability that is radically changing food security in the region."
Border actions.
A week before the 2018 midterm elections, the US Government sent 5,200 active-duty soldiers to the US-Mexico border to "harden" it with the 2,100 National Guard troops already present.
On November 23, mayor of Tijuana Juan Manuel Gastélum declared a "humanitarian crisis" in response to the large number of migrants in the city. By this date, over 5,000 members of the caravan were staying at the Tijuana Stadium— a structure with a capacity of 3,000.
On November 25, a group of approximately 500 migrants marched to the San Ysidro Port of Entry to demand answers. Frustrated by the slow pace of asylum application processing (approximately 60 per day) and the dire living conditions in their tent cities, they attempted to bypass the Mexican Federal Police to reach the border wall when a commotion occurred. A member of the caravan was caught on video throwing rocks at border agents while at the border wall. In response, the United States Border Patrol launched tear gas over the border at the group, which included women and children, and subsequently shut down the crossing for six hours. Photographs of the incident received significant media attention and sparked extensive international commentary. 42 migrants were arrested, and a total of 4 Border agents were struck by rocks.
Political reaction in the U.S..
In the United States, the migrant caravan was a major issue for President Donald Trump and other Republicans and conservatives in the 2018 mid-term elections. Immigrant invasion rhetoric was used by conservative commentators on "Fox News". The caravan was described as an "invading horde" by Laura Ingraham, an "invasion" by Steve Doocy, "a full-scale invasion by a hostile force" by Michelle Malkin, "a criminal involvement on the part of these leftist mobs" and "a highly organized, very elaborate sophisticated operation" by Chris Farrell. According to closed captioning transcripts, the word "invasion" was used in relation to the caravan more than 60 times on Fox News in October 2018 and more than 75 times on Fox Business. Commentators noted that mentions of the caravan by Fox News dropped dramatically immediately following the 2018 midterm elections.
Trump told supporters that there were "criminals and unknown Middle Easterners" in the caravan despite the lack of any publicized evidence for this charge. Likewise, Vice President Pence in an interview with Fox News stated:
What the president of Honduras told me is that the caravan was organized by leftist organizations, political activists within Honduras, and he said it was being funded by outside groups, and even from Venezuela … So the American people, I think, see through this—they understand this is not a spontaneous caravan of vulnerable people.
The president of Honduras at the time, Juan Orlando Hernández, was a member of the right-wing National party and an opponent of the Venezuelan government lead by Nicolás Maduro.
The Twitter account of the Department of Homeland Security's "confirmed" that within the caravan there were people who are "gang members or have significant criminal histories," but did not offer any evidence of ties. The National Rifle Association's NRATV alleged that "a bevy of left-wing groups" were working with George Soros and the Venezuelan government "to try to influence the 2018 midterms by sending Honduran migrants north in the thousands".
On November 2, 2018, five days before the election, the Department of Homeland Security website issued a press release, "Myth vs. Fact: Caravan", stating that "over 270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories, including known gang membership". It cited no sources for the specific numbers and crimes claimed, but did cite Mexican officials to back up their claim that the caravan contained criminal groups. The DHS also claimed the caravan contained migrants from Afghanistan, Somalia, India and Bangladesh, though they didn't cite any sources.
One study by the National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events (CREATE) at the University of Southern California and the Institute for Defense Analyses stated that the Central American immigrants the U.S. and claiming asylum had more in common with economic migrants than traditional refugees. Both groups receive funding or sponsorship from the US government.
Reactions in Mexico.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said: "Obviously, we have to help because Central American migrants pass through our territory and we have to bring order to this migration, make sure it’s legal."
The 2019 survey found that 58% of Mexican respondents oppose migration from Central America.
Late 2020 caravans.
As the United States prepared for elections in 2020 unknown groups promoted messages on social media sites for another caravan.
In October 2020, migrant caravans from Honduras have been either intercepted by Guatemalan Army officers and deported back to Honduras upon reaching the border crossings, or some of them have evaded border restrictions and reached Guatemala City, with intent to continuing their journey to Mexico. The Mexican military and border police have repeatedly warned that no migrant caravans will be allowed to cross into Mexico.
Early 2021 caravans.
After Joe Biden won the 2020 United States presidential election, there was a resurgence in migrant caravan activities. This may be related to Biden's planned amnesty for illegal immigrants within his first 100 days in office.
On January 13, just one week prior to the Joe Biden's presidential inauguration, more than 3000 people departed Honduras and El Salvador for the United States. That number grew to approximately 7000-8000 one week later.
On January 16, Guatemala and Mexico deployed the military to their borders, in an attempt to stop the migrant caravan from transiting through their countries on the way to the United States. Three days later, the migrant caravans reportedly dissolved in the Guatemalan-Honduran border region, and most its participants were deported back to Honduras.

1940 United States presidential election in Michigan

The 1940 United States presidential election in Michigan took place on November 5, 1940, as part of the 1940 United States presidential election. Voters chose 19 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Michigan was narrowly won by the Republican candidate Wendell Willkie over Democratic incumbent Franklin D. Roosevelt by 6,926 votes in the closest race in any statewide presidential election since 1916 when Woodrow Wilson won by 56 votes in New Hampshire and opponent Charles Evans Hughes won in Minnesota by 392 votes. Willkie received 49.85% of ballots cast, while Roosevelt received 49.52%. This was the only election where Michigan supported Roosevelt's opponent, as well as the last election until 1976 that Michigan voted for a different candidate than Pennsylvania.

The Salmonberry Trail is a planned "rail-and-trail" hiking and biking trail through the Oregon Coast Range along the Salmonberry River in northwest Oregon, United States. The railroad was washed out by a storm in 2007. In 2012, advocacy efforts to build a trail were launched, and in 2018, the Salmonberry Trail Intergovernmental Agency was established to oversee the development of the trail.
The Salmonberry Trail has four sections with a total of 84 miles. The coastal section is 26 miles long and runs from the city of Wheeler to the city of Tillamook. This section goes through the cities of Rockaway Beach, Garibaldi, and Bay City. This portion of the trail will also connect with the Tillamook Cheese Factory. Another section is about 17 miles from Salmonberry River and Nehalem River to Wheeler. One section is 16 miles that is along the Nehalem River. This section is most primitive of the four sections. The last section of the trail, 25 miles, is closest to the city of Portland. Starting in Banks and ending at the Cochran Trailhead, in the Tillamook State Forest. A map of this route can be found on the official website.

Diuris pulchella

Diuris pulchella, commonly called the beautiful donkey orchid is a species of orchid that is endemic to the south-eastern part of the south-west of Western Australia. It has two or three leaves at its base and up to five bright yellow and mauve flowers described as "exquisite", "spectacular" and "attractive". It grows in shallow soil on granite outcrops near Esperance.
Description.
"Diuris pulchella" is a tuberous, perennial herb with two or three linear to lance-shaped leaves, each leaf long, wide and folded lengthwise. Up to five bright yellow flowers with mauve, green and white markings, long and wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal projects forwards near its base then curves upwards and is egg-shaped to kidney-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, green with purplish markings, long, about wide and turned downwards. The petals are more or less erect with an egg-shaped blade long and wide on a greenish mauve stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is wedge-shaped to more or less round or kidney-shaped, wide and the side lobes are long and wide. There is a single yellow, ridge-like callus occupying about one-third of the length of the labellum near its base. Flowering occurs in August and September.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris pulchella" was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Mount Ney Nature Reserve, and the description was published in "Australian Orchid Review". The specific epithet ("pulchella") is the diminutive form of the Latin word "pulcher" meaning "beautiful" hence "beautiful little", referring to the "highly colourful and attractive flowers". Other authors have described the flowers as "exquisite" or "spectacular".
Distribution and habitat.
The beautiful donkey orchid grows usually in shallow soil on and around granite outcrops and is found between Salmon Gums, Esperance and Balladonia in the Coolgardie, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions.
Conservation.
"Diuris pulchella" is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia).

Salonia gens

The gens Salonia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned as early as the fourth century BC, but few of them attained any of the higher offices of the Roman state, until the latter part of the first century AD, when they married into the imperial family.
Origin.
The nomen "Salonius" belongs to a large class of gentilicia formed from words ending in "-o", using the suffix "". The root of the name is "salo", a salt-dealer, from "sal", salt, and indicates that an ancestor of the Salonii was probably a dealer in salt, one of the most important commodities of antiquity.

List of Ulvophyceae genera

The Ulvophyceae or ulvophytes are a class of green algae, distinguished mainly on the basis of ultrastructural morphology, life cycle and molecular phylogenetic data. The ulvophytes are diverse in their morphology and their habitat. Most are seaweeds, although a select few live in fresh water.
This list of Ulvophyceae genera is sub-divided by order and family. Some genera have uncertain taxonomic placement and are listed as "incertae sedis". The list is based on the data available in AlgaeBase, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), the National Center for Biotechnology Information taxonomic database (NCBI), and other taxonomic databases.

Laura Stachel

Laura Stachel is a former medical doctor who founded and leads We Care Solar, a nonprofit that manufactures solar electric systems the size of a suitcase for use in medical clinics in the developing world. She is also the mother of actor and singer Ari'el Stachel.
Education and early life.
Laura Stachel was brought up in the Boston area. She earned her undergraduate degree at Oberlin College, earned her medical degree at University of California, San Francisco in 1985, and in 2006 earned a master's in public health from UC Berkeley.
Career.
Stachel practiced as an ob/gyn doctor after finishing medical school, but in 2002 pain from degeneration in the vertebrae in her neck forced her to quit delivering babies and eventually to leave clinical medicine. She went back to school to earn a masters in public health and began lecturing at UC Berkeley. In 2008, while studying for her doctorate, she traveled to Nigeria to study what rates of maternal mortality were so high. During that time she witnessed how lack of electricity directly affected health outcomes for women and infants during childbirth.
Her husband, Hal Aronson, was creating solar education programs in the San Francisco Bay area. She asked if he could design a system that would target areas of the Nigerian hospital most important for maternal health. The solar electric system he created for the maternity ward, labor room, operating theater, and laboratory, helped the hospital achieve a 70% drop in maternal mortality the next year. Surrounding clinics began to ask for solar power, and Hal designed solar power for ob/gyn clinics in the developing world. Aronson designed a system the size of a suitcase to allow Laura to transport these to Africa. The Solar Suitcase had solar panels to be removed and mounted on the roof, a charge controller, a 12-volt battery, LED lights, and multiple outlets; the "Solar Suitcase" was eventually further developed to include phone chargers, a fetal monitor, and customized long-lasting LED lights. Stachel brought the first one back to Nigeria in 2009 and the clinic asked to keep it. Hal and Laura received further help from an engineer, Brent Moellenberg, and support from Bay area solar companies Everbright Solar and Holly Solar Products, to perfect the design and work out the manufacturing.
The couple established a nonprofit, We Care Solar (formally WE CARE — an acronym for Women's Emergency Communication and Reliable Electricity), and it received its IRS nonprofit ruling in 2011. The couple at first built the solar devices in their garage and backyard. They sought ways to fund it; Stachel competed in a technology for social good competition in 2009, earning only an "honorable mention," but one of the judges connected them with the Blum Center for Developing Economies at UC Berkeley which provided the nonprofit with office space and financial support.
In 2010 the nonprofit received an order from WHO for 20 devices in clinics in Liberia, and received a grant from the MacArthur Foundation, allowing them pilot Solar Suitcases in Nigeria and Uganda and to hire an engineer. Stachel entered several more social entrepreneurship business competitions and received mentoring and scholarships to understand how to run nonprofit. Over the next few years, We Care Solar built a team of finance, programmatic, and engineering staff. By 2019, according to Stachel, there were more than 4,000 Solar Suitcases installed in more than 20 countries, and We Care Solar had worked with 45 other NGOs and UN agencies to serve more than 1.9 million mothers.
Awards and honors.
Stachel was selected for the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50; made up of entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists and creators who are over the age of 50.

Tomb Effigy of Jacquelin de Ferrière

The Tomb Effigy of Jacquelin de Ferrière is usually on display in the Medieval Art Gallery of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The effigy is of the French knight, Sir Jacquelin de Ferrière, who was from Montargis, near Sens in northern France. The effigy is dated between 1275-1300 CE. It is long, wide, and deep, and carved into a flat limestone slab, which now has a wooden frame. Effigies were often commissioned by the nobles or their families, as a means of remembrance. They would normally be found covering the sarcophagi of the knight, or installed in or near a church that the family were patrons of. Although the inscription on this effigy is not clear, most effigies contained similar inscriptions that would include the name and title, dates of birth and death–or approximates, a link between the date of death and a notable holy figure or day, and petitions of prayer that would offer pardons to those that prayed for the depicted soul–largely an attempt to create a tangible link between the nobility and divinity.
Noble ideals.
The age and imagery of this effigy, and most others during this period, represent the ideals of nobility during the 13th century as they wanted to be remembered. It was important for knights to be remembered as religious, of certain social status, and conforming to ideas of gender. This is why many are depicted as armed and armored, with heraldry and symbolic imagery included. These images were highly stylized and idealized, and rarely represented what the actual person looked like, instead portraying what a knight was expected to look like. The age of representation was also important. Although Jacquelin de Ferrière died while older, he is depicted, as most nobles during this period, around the age of thirty three. This age not only represented the ideal age of knights, but was also the supposed age of Jesus Christ when he was crucified.
Imagery.
Chainmail.
Chainmail was the prominent form of armor during the 13th century. A precursor to plate armor, chainmail protected its wearer from opponents while allowing mobility, and was extremely effective against edged weapons and thrust attacks.
Shield.
The shield was an important part of a knight's armament. While chainmail offered protection against thrusting and edged attacks, it offered little protection against the force blunt strike from a sword or lance. The long, tapered shield offered the knight's body protection from forceful blows while on horseback or on foot. The shield was also a place for knights to signify their loyalty or identity with displays of heraldry. On the shield of Jacquelin de Ferrière, horseshoes can be seen across the top of the shield.
Sword.
The sword depicted is unique from other swords of this period. "Thirteenth-century pommels mostly had the shape either of a disk or a more or less pointed oval... If in an exceptional case, such as the sword on the incised tomb slab of Jaquelin de Ferriere, a trilobate pom- mel can be found, it is clearly only a scalloped variant of the disk-shaped pommel and is invariably associated with a guard of long, straight quillons."
Spurs.
When a squire became a knight, a formal ceremony would take place to welcome the newly dubbed knight. This would include an all night prayer vigil, the girding–or hanging of his sword, a blow to the cheek from the flat part of the sword by an elder, and the bestowal of his spurs. In iconography, the spurs distinguished the noble knights from other armored soldiers, such as infantrymen.
Iconography.
The horseshoes on the shield are an example of puns in heraldry. The pun lies within the last name, Ferrière, which is a derivative of farrier, or a smith who shoes horses.
Animals were often included symbolically on effigies in the Late Middle Ages. In this effigy, two dogs can be seen flanking Jacquelin de Ferrière. The dog mostly symbolized loyalty and faithfulness, letting those who would see the effigy that person accompanied by the dogs was faithful and loyal to his family, religion, and liege lord.

Church of Our Lady of the Conception of the Military

The Church of Our Lady of the Conception of the Military () is an 18th-century Roman Catholic church in Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. It is located on Rua Nova in the historic center of Recife and is under the administration of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Olinda e Recife. The church was listed as a historic structure by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute in 1941.
History.
The Recife Infantry Regiment ("Terço da Vila de Santo Antônio do Recife"), which included officers, sergeants and squares of the Corps of Execution and Cavalry, organized a Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Conception of the Military in the early 18th century. Under the command of João Lobo de Lacerda they requested permission to construct a church dedicated to Our Lady of the Conception on March 19, 1725. Some evidence dates to the beginning of construction of the church to 1710. It was completed in 1771.
Construction of the church was authorized by Antônio Fernandes de Matos. It features a simple, severe façade, in contrast to its richly decorated interior. The structures lacks a churchyard. It is constructed of heavy stonework, a single tower, and Rococo pediment. The interior walls are richly decorated with baroque carving.
The vault of the chancel is notably complex. It consists of a crossed arch with two side altars as typical of the period of King João V. The ceiling of the nave is a style associated with Nicolau Nasoni and André Soares, a sculptor, of northern Portugal. The length of the nave has a carved veranda; it is the only example of this type of construction in Recife. The ceiling of the name is richly painted with themes associated with the life of the Virgin Mary.
The paintings of the church depict elements atypical and possibly prohibited by the Church of the period, including "homunculus" of Jesus Christ on the breast of the Virgin Mary. A painting depicting the Battle of Guararapes is located in the lower choir. It was commissioned by Governor José César de Meneses, and attributed to João de Deus Sepúlveda. The central painting of the Virgin is attributed to José Rabelo Gonçalves.
The church remains under the management of the Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Conception of the Military.
Protected status.
The Church of Our Lady of the Conception of the Military was listed as a historic structure by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute in 1941. The heritage designation includes both the church and the Summer Palace of the Archbishop. The structures were registered under the Book of Historical Works, Inscription 4-T and Book of Fine Arts, Inscription fl 53. Both directives are dated September 25, 1941.
Access.
The church is open to the public and may be visited.

Raupa

Raul Valdes Gonzalez, known by his friends and professionally as Raupa, was born in Havana, Cuba on March 4, 1980. He is an independent artist and has created images of events and institutions of great importance to the Cuban culture. Graphic design and film “motion graphics” are his concentration, produced through the language of illustration, animation and video.
History and personal life.
Raupa grew up in Habana Vieja (Old Havana) and attended the Superior Institute of Design (ISDI), the only graphic design school in Cuba. He graduated in 2005 and began working as a graphic designer for The National Fine Arts Museum of Havana, Cuba. He also taught poster design and illustration at ISDI from 2005 - 2009 while working as an independent artist.
He is currently living in Plaza de la Revolucion, a municipality of Havana, with his wife Vanessa and son Javier.
Artistic endeavors.
In 2006, while developing his own designs and teaching at ISDI, Raupa was asked to develop the visual art works for La Casa del las Americas, an important Cuban cultural center founded after the 1959 revolution. This center's objectives are to investigate, sponsor, reward and publish the work of writers, musicians, theater players and other artists from Cuba. Raupa continues to handle all the visual artwork for this institution and has staged solo and group exhibitions at the center including –
Raupa continued creating his graphic images for the 6th to 13th Festivals of New Filmmakers of the Cuban Institute of Cinematographic Art and Industry (ICAIC) from 2007 until 2012. In association with ICAIC, he also designed the posters for the film “7 Days in Havana”, a contemporary snapshot of Havana shot in seven chapters directed by seven international filmmakers.
In 2017, Raupa was chosen to create the complete graphic design program for the 39th Latin American Film Festival Campaign. Using a blue green and red coral that is literally growing out of the poster, his design represented the theme of the festival – the growth of the Cuban and Latin American Film industry.
The same year, in conjunction with the Pratt Institute and the American Museum of Natural History's exhibition "¡Cuba!", Raupa demonstrated the art of screen printing in a two-day mobile workshop that concluded with a guest lecture at Pratt. All participants were able to take home a poster of their own design. The endeavor was co-funded by the Cuban Initiative Fund and Pratt's School of Art in order to foster cultural exchange initiatives between the U.S. and Cuba.
Raupa has created the titles and promotional posters for various Cuban films including Penumbras, 2011, The Broken Gods Los Dioses Rotos, 2007, Kangamba, 2007, Behavior Conducta 2013 and Sergio y Sergei, as well as for the music program on Cuban television Floor 6. In addition, he has designed visual images for The Embassy of Italy and Belgium in Cuba and the 2009 St. Louis USA Shakespeare Festival. He served as the art director for Havana Cultura.com as well as for HAVANA Club International - a Cuban rum company formed by a 50:50 joint venture between Pernod Ricard and the Cuban government. His current project for Havana Club consists of directing four commercials about creating their premium Iconica rum.
Exhibitions and collaborations.
In 2007, Raupa's solo exhibition titled "Spotsition", offered more than 20 original visual works at the Centre for Development of Visual Arts in Cuba.  The exhibition theme was The Spots of Public Good.
Besides his solo exhibitions, Raupa has contributed to various exhibitions highlighting graphic arts. In 2012, Yale University sponsored an artists' reception  for the exhibit "Posters From an Island - 4 Artists of Cuba," which featured his works along with three other Cuban Artists.
Raupa's works were displayed at the 2015 Festival Expo at the Front Art Space Gallery in New York, a collection of posters showcasing Cuban films. The same year, he was one of the graphic artists featured in Cuba a la Vista at the Besançon Museum of Fine Arts in France. This exhibition featured a wide range of Cuban posters from the 1960s until today.
Raupa is a member of a group of five Cuban designers and friends called Nocturnal that work together to design posters and produce exhibitions for commercial and artistic concerns.  Since no commercial advertising is allowed in Cuba, their commercial endeavors are for clients outside of Cuba.

Charles A. Windle

Charles A. Windle (September 9, 1866 – January 5, 1934) was a Chicago journalist and opponent of prohibition.
Windle was born in Ethel, Missouri. He became editor of William Brann's "Iconoclast" in 1903; the magazine changed its title to "The Liberal" in 1926, and Windle remained editor until his death. According to Frank Luther Mott, a historian of American magazines, Windle was "a picturesque and violent writer, in the Brann tradition". He began running anti-prohibition columns in the magazine in 1911, and continued to criticize it throughout the dry era, publishing several pamphlets in that cause, including "The Case Against Prohibition". He was one of the founders of the Association Opposed to Prohibition, and debated "Pussyfoot" Johnson, a well-known prohibitionist, in Scotland. He was married and had three sons and a daughter. His son, C. Pliny Windle, became business manager of the magazine after World War I, and then associate editor, finally taking over the magazine after his father's death.
He was well-known as a campaigner for Democratic candidates, speaking extensively in Illinois and Iowa on behalf of William Jennings Bryan.

William Franklin Frakes

 William Franklin Frakes (1858-1942) was an American rancher, naturalist, adventurer, and author. 
The son of pioneers Samuel H. T. Frakes and Almeda Mudgett Frakes, William Frakes grew up on their ranch at Elizabeth Lake, next to that of his cousin Frank Frakes. He studied in San Jose, probably at the forerunner of the University of the Pacific, but then left to pursue a life focused on the outdoors. He traveled to Argentina in the 1890s, where he explored the country, collected animals, and also fought off a bandit ambush (killing two of his attackers). He introduced the nutria (a rodent species of unusually large size) to North America from Argentina and set up a nutria farm at his ranch in Elizabeth Lake in 1899 (with the encouragement of David Starr Jordan of Stanford University). Later some nutria escaped and went feral, with negative ecological impacts. In 1904, he also introduced quail to Santa Catalina Island, founding the quail covey there. He tried to domesticate bighorn sheep with mixed results (and corresponded with leading naturalists about the topic and contributed some specimens to the Smithsonian Institution). He enjoyed hunting in the Antelope Valley and at his hunting cabin near Camp Cady, CA (the Mojave Desert) with his cousin William Mudgett (1877-1946) of Neenach, CA. Also a writer of nature and adventure stories, Will Frakes had a surprisingly engaging style.
 He moved to Phoenix in 1920 and died there in 1942.

Extensive category

In mathematics, an extensive category is a category "C" with finite coproducts that are disjoint and well-behaved with respect to pullbacks. Equivalently, "C" is extensive if the coproduct functor from the product of the slice categories "C"/"X" × "C"/"Y" to the slice category "C"/("X" + "Y") is an equivalence of categories for all objects "X" and "Y" of "C".
Examples.
The categories Set and Top of sets and topological spaces, respectively, are extensive categories. More generally, the category of presheaves on any small category is extensive.
The category CRing"op" of affine schemes is extensive.

He attended the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis and completed all of the combine and positional drills.
At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Cappa was projected to be a fifth round pick by the majority of NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked as the 14th best offensive tackle prospect in the draft by DraftScout.com and was ranked the 15th best offensive tackle by Scouts Inc.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers selected Cappa in the third round with the 94th overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. The Buccaneers traded their fourth (102nd overall) and sixth round picks (180th overall) in the 2018 NFL Draft to the Minnesota Vikings in exchange for the Vikings' third round pick to draft Cappa. Cappa was the 12th offensive tackle drafted in 2018 and became Humboldt State's highest draft selection in school history. He also holds the distinction of being Humboldt State's 11th player drafted and the first player selected in the NFL Draft since Freeman Baysinger in 1992. Cappa also holds the distinction of being the final player ever drafted from Humboldt State as the school discontinued its football program after the 2018 season.
On May 13, 2018, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed Cappa to a four-year, $3.36 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $793,704. As a rookie, Cappa appeared in six games, all at the end of the regular season.
Cappa made his first career start in the 2019 regular season opener against the San Francisco 49ers. In a game against the New Orleans Saints on October 6, 2019, Cappa suffered a broken left arm but did not miss a snap after sustaining the injury in the second quarter.
During the COVID-19 outbreak Cappa has been particularly involved with supporting local restaurants and businesses. His efforts have also energized other Tampa Bay players to insure revenues continue for the local eateries.
On January 9, 2021, in the Wild Card Round against the Washington Football Team, Cappa suffered a fractured ankle. On January 15, 2021, Cappa was placed on injured reserve due to the injury. The Buccaneers went on to win Super Bowl LV to give Cappa a Super Bowl title.

Kingdom of Ormond

The Kingdom of Ormond (Modern Irish: - "East Munster") was a short-lived kingdom in medieval Ireland. It existed in 12th century AD, comprising the eastern part of Munster, in what is now County Tipperary, with parts of County Kilkenny and County Waterford.
The kingdom was formed from a partition of the preceding Kingdom of Munster. It was a fief of the O'Kennedy family, but was soon conquered by the Anglo-Normans, who created the Earldom of Ormond as part of the Lordship of Ireland, under the suzerainty of the Butler family. However, the O'Kennedys, now styled "Lords of Ormond", long struggled with the Butlers for control of the region. In 1336 a peace treaty was signed between the two families, but in 1347 the O'Kennedys were able to drive out the Butlers from Nenagh Castle and install there, keeping the manor for more than two hundred years.
Two modern Irish baronies, Ormond Upper and Ormond Lower, are named after the kingdom.

Twin Arrows, Arizona

Twin Arrows is a ghost town located in the central part of Arizona on U.S. Route 66 (US 66) in Coconino County between the city of Flagstaff and the town of Winslow.
Brief history.
The area in which Twin Arrows is located was inhabited by the Hopi and Navajo tribes. The Navajo fought against the Apaches in the area. The first settlers to arrive in the area of European descent were the Spanish conquistadores. The area became part of Mexico when Mexico gained its independence from Spain.
The United States fought against Mexico in what is known as the Mexican–American War. The war ended officially when the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed and forced onto the remnant Mexican government. It specified its major consequence, the Mexican Cession of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo México to the United States.
Wagon roads routes between Flagstaff and Winslow were surveyed in the 1880s. The Atlantic and Pacific Railroad choose to build the railroad along it. The railway passed to the north of the modern alignment of the National Old Trails which would eventually become US 66. The U.S. Highway System established US 66 in 1926. US 66 served as a major path for those who migrated west during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. The road supported the economies of the communities through which it passed.
Traffic began to flow through the Twin Arrows area because Route 66 was aligned along the National Old Trails Road. A business named the Canyon Padre Trading Post, named for the gorge that cuts nearby, was established in the late 1940s in Twin Arrows. Business was slow for the store and diner until the owners changed its name to "Twin Arrows Trading Post", inspired by nearby town of Two Guns and added a service station. Two giant arrows which were placed on the property were easily recognized by traveling motorist and the business began to fourish.
Decline.
The Twin Arrows Trading Post began to fail with the construction of the Interstate 40 (I-40), because motorists no longer had to take US 66. Business for the Twin Arrows Trading Post began to decline and it was not long before the store/diner/service station/gift shop passed through the hands of various owners. This continued until 1995, when it was finally closed and abandoned. 
The land where Twin Arrows is located is in the Navajo and Hopi reservations and owned by the Hopi tribe. In 2013, the Twin Arrows Navajo Gaming Casino opened to the north of the trading post site. The twin arrows sculpture, which is pictured, is featured on the album art of the musical album "Man Mountain" by Blue States.

Oregon Equal Suffrage Amendment

The Oregon Equal Suffrage Amendment was an amendment to the constitution of the U.S. state of Oregon, establishing women's suffrage, which was passed by ballot initiative in 1912. It had previously been placed on the ballot, initially by referral from the Oregon Legislative Assembly and later by popular initiative, in 1884, 1900, 1906, 1908, and 1910. When the initiative was ratified in 1912, Oregon became the seventh state to extend the right to vote to women.
Ballot measure #2 on the state's 1906 ballot was the "first attempt in American political history to amend the constitution of a state by the direct initiative of the people, and without any intervention by the legislature." The initiative failed, with 36,902 votes in favor and 47,075 against.
Abigail Scott Duniway was a longtime advocate for women's suffrage in Oregon.

Joaquim Ferreira Bogalho

Joaquim Ferreira Bogalho (11 December 1889 – 1 October 1977), also known as "the man of the stadium" (), was the 20th president of Portuguese sports club S.L. Benfica.
Bogalho was born in Alcobaça in 1889. After being awarded the Águia de Ouro (Golden Eagle) by Benfica on 31 July 1938, he was elected president of the club on 15 March 1952, a position he held until 30 March 1957, being reelected four times. He is considered the main responsible for the modernisation and professionalisation of the football team in 1954 with the signing of coach Otto Glória, and the construction of the original Estádio da Luz and the Centro de Estágio (Training Center), also known as Lar do Jogador (Player's Home). During his five-year presidency, Benfica won the Primeira Liga and Taça de Portugal in the same season twice, and more than doubled the number of club members ("sócios").
Bogalho died on 1 October 1977.

De Sylva v. Ballentine

De Sylva v. Ballentine, 351 U.S. 570 (1956), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held after the death of an author, the widow and children are eligible to renew copyright, equally as a class. Additionally, conditional on state laws, illegitimate children are also eligible for a share of the copyright.
This extension to children and widows was not considered retroactive by courts, however. In "Easton v. Universal Pictures Co.", 288 N.Y.S. 2d 776 (1968), a 1951 document assigning control of a copyright from the author's family after his death was invalidated because "they had, in fact, as the law then appeared to be, nothing to assign." Another limitation to this new right of inheritance was that the family would not be eligible to renew the copyright if it had been passed permanently to another party, which was in line with "Fred Fisher Music Co. v. M. Witmark &amp; Sons".

Tuncurry (1909)

The Tuncurry II was a wooden carvel screw steamer built in 1909 at Tuncurry, Australia.
The ship was designed to enable navigation of the shallow bars when entering estuaries. Also for general cargo and the accommodation for 21 saloon class passengers. In the 1930s, the ship was used as a collier.
In 1921 at Tuncurry, the ship was lengthened by almost twenty feet by Ernest Wright, son of John Wright.
The Tuncurry II was used by the Royal Australian Navy to transport cargo. A Vickers machine gun was fitted at Garden Island. The ship was purchased by the Commonwealth for the navy in 1944 and sold in 1946.
A vessel with a similar name operated at much the same time, and so the "Tuncurry (1903)" ex "Tokelau" should not be confused with the "Tuncurry (1909)".

Gilmore the lion

Gilmore (1930–1950) was a lion who flew with aviator Colonel Roscoe Turner to promote the Gilmore Oil Company. After he grew too large for flying, Gilmore accompanied Turner in publicity appearances for the next ten years. 
Gilmore was born on February 7, 1930, at Goebel's Wild Animal Farm – a theme park and supplier of animals for Hollywood movies. The lion was sponsored by and named after the Gilmore Oil Company, whose icon was a red lion with the slogan "Roar with Gilmore". The company gave Turner $15,000 to buy the lion and a plane that was decorated to advertise Gilmore Oil. The Humane Society petitioned Turner to equip Gilmore with a parachute, which also resulted in enhancing the image of a "flying lion". After he grew too large for flying, Gilmore accompanied Turner to publicity appearances over the next ten years. During a brief eight-month period, Gilmore logged over 25,000 miles in the air and was a passenger during multiple air speed record runs. When not flying, Gilmore made public appearances including at the golf course and disconcerted the mailman and other visitors to Turner's home when he answered the door.
Once he reached in weight and had outgrown the cockpit and his parachute, he was kept at the airport in Burbank, California (then known as the United Airport), and a Gilmore Oil service station in Beverly Hills until around 1940. He spent his last decade at the World Jungle Compound, where Turner continued to pay for his food and visited him, and died on December 17, 1950. Turner then had him mounted as a display to be kept in his home. After Roscoe Turner's death in 1970, both the plane used during the 1930 campaign and Gilmore's stuffed remains were exhibited at the Turner Museum until it closed in 1972. They were then donated by his wife to the Smithsonian Institution where they were exhibited first at the Arts and Industries Building and then at the National Air and Space Museum until 1981.
