Valley Arena Gardens

The Valley Arena Gardens, most commonly referred to as the Valley Arena, was a sporting and entertainment venue in Holyoke, Massachusetts, best known for hosting weekly boxing matches which included Rocky Marciano's debut professional fight. Though best known for its history as a boxing venue, the Valley Arena also hosted wrestling, basketball, roller hockey, miniature golf and featured its own restaurant. As a nightclub and theatre in the round venue it also hosted an array of vaudeville acts such as The Three Stooges and Bela Lugosi, as well as renowned musicians including Count Basie, Duke Ellington, The Ink Spots, The Dorsey Brothers, The Glenn Miller Orchestra, Sarah Vaughan, and The Temptations. In an interview with Woody Herman and band alumni, Jack Dulong, saxophonist and member of Herman's "Third Herd", described it as "an 'institution' for big bands."
Plagued by several fires, at least one of which was from suspected arson, as well as a decline in attendance with the emergence of television, the venue was closed following the 3rd such fire on May 12, 1960. After considerable delay, the building was ultimately demolished in August 1964.
Today the space where it once stood is occupied by the Valley Arena Park, a small recreational green space managed by the city.
History.
Prior to its permanent home in the gashouse, the Valley Arena was first established in a space at 560-66 Main Street in 1916 by Homer Rainault, and his business partner Amedee F. Goulet, as a gym. The two had previously run a cigar counter and billiard academy for 23 years in the same neighborhood, and by the time they opened the Valley Arena, Rainault was a promoter who had previously organized fights in Hartford, Troy, and West Springfield. Rainault's career as a promoter would really begin after 1920, when the Commonwealth officially legalized boxing, theretofore an underground sport. On August 11, 1925, Valley Arena, Inc. was formally incorporated, and by October 23, 1925, the company had purchased an old brick gasholder house from the City of Holyoke's municipal gas works. The sale at the time was listed in the register of deeds as a land sale as the gasholder house had been previously decommissioned in 1915, was briefly considered as a site for a new public bathhouse, but had remained unoccupied since. After 3 months of construction, the new converted Valley Arena Gardens debuted with their first fight on February 8, 1926 with a match between one "Petey" Mack and Leo "Kid" Roy.
On June 13, 1943, at approximately 2am, the first of three fires in the Arena's history broke out. An hour after owner Homer Rainault left the building, local patrolmen reported seeing flames billowing out of the building. Starting on the first floor and filling all reaches, the fire caused between an estimated $150–200 thousand dollars (approx. $2.1 to 2.5 million in 2017 USD). The building was insured however, but only for $100,000 dollars; in the weeks following the fire, owner Homer Rainault expressed doubts over rebuilding. Ultimately Rainault decided to rebuild, and used the Holyoke War Memorial Building as a music venue for the remainder of the year, hosting a number of artists, including The Ink Spots, during this time. Fights continued at a local club in Springfield and by August of that year, Rainault had put everything in place to rebuild. Eight months after the devastating fire, the venue reopened on February 28, 1944 with a 10 round match between bantamweight champion Louis Salica and one Mario Colon, a rising star from Mexico.
In 1944, the Arena's founder Homer Rainault died unexpectedly from a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 58; by that time he had gained a reputation as a promoter for giving many nationally famous boxers their start in the Connecticut Valley. The board of directors ultimately voted for his nephew, Oreal D. Rainault to take his place. Rainault would eventually sell the venue in 1952 to two businessmen, Jack and Ralph Kane of Norfolk, Virginia; making it clear that this sale was only partial as he retained stock in the company.
Even before the second fire, the venue had begun to see a decline in its attendance for boxing matches as television gained popularity while stage shows and events that relied on audience attendance saw shrinking numbers across the country. On November 11, 1952, the boxing matchmaker, Joe Di Maria, resigned due to dwindling crowds that season. In contrast with its boxing, by the end of 1952, concerns had been raised by Holyoke police and fire departments about overcrowding at the venue's night club. On December 23, the police and fire chiefs held a conference stating that maximum capacities would be discussed with and enforced by the Arena's management, denying rumors that the venue was being given a pass.
Only three days after that press conference, on December 26, 1952, the second started in the Circus Lounge of that building in the early hours of the morning. Future Holyoke fire chief William W. Mahoney, then a member of one of the companies which fought the fire, later went on to describe it as "one of the most vicious fires for smoke conditions [he'd] ever seen," severe enough that an eye doctor had to set up a first aid station at the scene. The three-alarm fire quickly spread, and led to tenants across South Holyoke being roused from their beds in case of a possible evacuation. In total the fire caused an estimated $250,000 of damages (approx. $2.3 million in 2018 USD), and injured 6 firefighters. The fire had begun in the basement, and with the premises flooded for several days, firefighters were not immediately able to determine its cause. While formal inquests were made and hours of testimony given by the owners and multiple employees under oath, conflicting accounts were found and the fire was deemed "of unknown but suspicious origin" by the state police captain tasked with its investigation.
While the city had allowed boxing to continue in the Holyoke War Memorial building during the previous fire, this was not the case the second time. Before Jack Kane or anyone else associated with the arena could approach the War Memorial Commission, their chairman Thomas Epstein introduced a motion, passed unanimously, opposing the use of the hall for wrestling or boxing matches. The venue would reopen following its last reconstruction, on September 28, 1953.
After the final fire on May 12, 1960, Oreal Rainault elected not to not attempt rebuilding the venue. Following a prolonged period where the burnt-out ruins of the building sat vacant, the Valley Arena Gardens were demolished throughout the month of August, 1964.
Boxing.
While it hosted many well known musicians and other sporting events, the Arena was best remembered as a boxing venue, where many champions across multiple weight classes got their start in their early professional careers. Among the many other household names who would fight in the ring, were Beau Jack, Willie Pep, Kid Kaplan, Lou Ambers, Billy Petrolle, Jack Delaney, Frankie Genaro, Sandy Saddler, Rocky Graziano, Ike Williams, and Ernie Schaaf. Jersey Joe Walcott, best known as the oldest man to ever win the world heavyweight championship title at the age of 37 (prior to George Foreman's win at 45 in 1994), also fought in the Arena for an exhibition match.
Within a decade of opening, the Arena had gained such prominence in the national boxing scene by the 1930s that Holyoke news held a regular column in the boxing magazine "The Ring".
More than two decades after the venue had burnt down, World Featherweight Champion Willie Pep was quoted as saying "it was a breeding place...anybody who was anybody boxed there." One Mike Cipriano, a New York promoter who managed Jake LaMotta and Harry LaSane, described it as "a little Madison Square Garden...the arena was known from coast to coast—they'd sell out almost every week...it was nothing for a bunch of us to pile into a car and head for Holyoke...If you didn't fight in Holyoke, you weren't a fighter" The venue was known for having raucous crowds, notably on April 26, 1954, when a boxer, Howard Saligny of New York, made low blows against one Gerry Tessier of Springfield, within minutes the ringside spectators had poured into the ring punching and kicking Saligny to the ground; police eventually restored order.
The Arena hosted the first match in the continental United States of Sixto Escobar, the first Puerto Rican to win a world title. On May 7, 1934, Escobar, a bantamweight, defeated bantamweight contender and Canadian flyweight champion Bobby Leitham, in a fight that made headlines in local papers and was described as a "dramatic upset". The match of 10 rounds was ended abruptly in the seventh, when a referee realized the extent to which Leitham's left eye had been hemorrhaged by a sharp right overhand which had also left a gash across his cheek. Escobar was declared winner of the match by technical knockout.
The Arena hosted Rocky Marciano's professional debut in the ring, as a 4-round opener against Holyoke native Lee (real name Leslie V.) Epperson on St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 1947. In the first professional bout of his career the Brockton native, then stationed in the air force at Westover, was billed as "Rocky Mackianno of Westover Field" or "Rocky Mac" for short. Having been set up for the opening fight by a friend who had known Rainault, Marciano managed to hold on for the first two rounds as Epperson landed several blows as his own missed. The match came to an abrupt end however, 42 seconds into the third round when Marciano landed a sharp right uppercut, knocking his opponent through the ropes and out of the ring. Because the fight predated Marciano's continuous professional career by about a year, and he had been billed under a slightly different name, it remained entirely obscure until later in the heavyweight's career. After retiring, Marciano would make a second appearance at the venue a decade later, serving as a referee. Brought on at the invitation of boxing promoter Sam Silverman, it would be billed as his "Eastern Debut" in such a capacity- his only previous referee role being at a venue in New Orleans.
Music.
Throughout nearly the entirety of its existence the Arena booked many famous musicians for its night club, which featured its own in-house orchestra. Spanning generations, it hosted many famous musicians across several genres, including jazz, blues, big band, country, soul, and rock &amp; roll with such names as- Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Wee Bonnie Baker, The Dorsey Brothers, The Ink Spots, Lionel Hampton, Roy Rogers, The Glenn Miller Orchestra, Sarah Vaughan, The Temptations, Shep Fields, and Jack Teagarden.
The venue was known both as a regular stop for big band musicians, and an arduous gig among acts in the 1950s. In a 1986 interview, Woody Herman alumni Jack E. DuLong, a saxophonist, described it as "that infamous job that all bands hated, that all-day thing at the Holyoke Arena...It was Sunday, and you'd get in early in the morning, and rehearse perhaps a dozen acts and play three shows; one in the afternoon and two in the evening. You would start rehearsing in the morning without even an hour's sleep. It was a theater-in-the-round type thing, an 'institution' for big bands. After there we went into Brooklyn, New York, for a theater engagement."
Other.
The Arena also served as a venue for regular vaudeville shows as well, and several known stage actors including noted impersonator Larry Blake, and Bela Lugosi, of Dracula fame. In 1942, the venue found itself at the center of a political controversy when the mayor of Holyoke at that time, Henry J. Toepfert instituted a ban on all vaudeville acts on Sundays, building on previous Massachusetts blue laws that prevented dancing or the use of "grotesque" costumes on Sundays. The Arena had however already booked several such acts for Sundays from prior contracts, and was allowed by the city to continue them, despite protest from other venues in the city.
The Arena was also host to a number of well-known comedians. On three occasions, October 5, 1947, November 23, 1947 and April 30, 1950, The Three Stooges, Moe, Larry, and Shemp, gave performances at the venue. On an unknown date in the summer of 1950, comedian Lenny Bruce reportedly did a set. Comic Jerry Colonna would also perform at the Arena in 1946 and briefly made news when Oreal Rainault sued him for a second show at Riverside Park in Agawam. A prior contract had stipulated he not perform at any venue within 21 miles for 21 days before or after their booked show. While a temporary injunction was granted, it was ultimately dismissed.
Among other early sporting events hosted at the Arena, the venue also served as the home for the local amateur basketball league's "All-Valley Team", which included at least two players who had been invited to play in the American Basketball League. Wrestling was also a common event at the venue, with such names as Arnold Skaaland, Angelo Savoldi, Chief Don Eagle, and Bull Curry. The Fabulous Moolah made her New England debut at the Arena under the name June Ellison on June 25, 1949. Hans Mortier, billed as Tarzan Zorro, made his New England debut at the Arena on October 8, 1952.
Valley Arena Park.
The land where the venue once stood was sold to the city by the Rainault family in 1968 and was converted initially into space for a playground
Within a year's time these plans were expanded into a playground and wading pool with bathhouse, with construction beginning in 1969. The park reopened in 1970. Despite being the site of a former gasworks, a comprehensive environmental assessment taken from 2004 through 2005 of the soils at the site found no contamination of the site inconsistent with background noise typically found in urban soils.

Early life and education.
Trujillo was born on January 4, 1980, in Cali, Colombia. Her mother was a medical student when she got pregnant and had to leave her studies to look after her daughter. Trujillo attended 'Colegio Internacional Cañaverales', a bilingual school accredited by the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO). From her school years, she had interest in science and questioned the roles that are traditionally associated with women. 
Uncertain but determined to overcome the economic difficulties that her family faced in Colombia, she moved to the United States at the age of seventeen with only $300. In order to improve her language skills, she started English lessons at the Miami Dade College while working as a housekeeper, among other jobs. 
Trujillo enrolled initially at the University of Florida to pursue studies in Aerospace Engineering, inspired by a magazine article about the role of women working on aerospace missions and having self-confidence in her strong Mathematical skills. While studying at the university, she decided to apply for the NASA Academy, being the first Hispanic immigrant woman admitted to the program. She was indeed one of the two participants to get a job offer from NASA. During her work at the Academy, she met NASA robots expert Brian Roberts, who convinced her to move to Maryland with the aim of increasing her chances in the Aerospace industry. Trujillo attended the University of Maryland where she was part of the Professor Roberts' research team focused on robots in space operations. In 2007, she earned a bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Maryland. Her story was turned into a children's science book titled "Mars Science Lab - Engineer" by Kari Cornell and Fatima Khan She was a member of Sigma Gamma Tau.
Career.
Trujillo joined NASA in 2007, working at Goddard Space Flight Center on the Constellation program and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on human and robotic space missions. She has served many roles, including Surface Sampling System Activity Lead and Dust Removal Tool Lead Systems Engineer. She was responsible for ensuring Curiosity's sampling fulfilled its science objectives dust-free whilst maintaining operational safety. The Dust Removal Tool took her six months to develop, and brushes the dust of the surface of Mars to allow scientists to investigate the surface below. It was used on Curiosity's 151st day on Mars. In 2009 she was appointed telecom systems engineer for the Curiosity Rover. Trujillo was responsible for the communications between the spacecraft and scientists on Earth. She has also been Flight Ground Systems Engineer and Vehicle System Testbed Mars Surface Lead. She was at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory when the rover landed on Mars. In 2014, Trujillo was promoted to Mission Lead. That year, she was listed as in the 20 most influential Latinos in the Technology Industry.
Trujillo worked as flight director on the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover robotic armand in February 2021, she hosted NASA's first Spanish-language planetary landing show.
She has been involved in several initiatives to inspire young women from Latin America and African-American women to pursue a career in science and engineering. She took part in a discussion about Hidden Figures at the University of Southern California alongside Octavia Spencer and Pharrell Williams. She has been a mentor for the Brooke Owens Fellowship, which she created with her husband Will Pomerantz.
In June 2020, Trujillo was appointed to the Brooke Owens Fellowship's Executive Board She was awarded the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Bruce Murray Award for "Excellence in Education and Public Engagement". She was featured on CBS' 2018 celebration of Women's History Month.

Rural development in Nigeria

Since independence, several rural development programs have been implemented in Nigeria.
In Nigeria, several subsequent governments have implemented different policies in an attempt to develop the rural areas and alleviate the poverty rate that has become a prominent decadence in such areas. However, very little success has been recorded so far.
The first National Development plan spanned between the years 1962–1968, with agriculture being the major priority. The major objective was developing and expanding the production and export of cash crops. But this plan only provided 42% of the capital budget to Agriculture.
In 1970, the second national development plan was launched by General Yakubu Gowon and it lasted until 1974. Its focus was on balancing the difference between rural and urban development while making an attempt to rectify some of the shortcomings that trailed the first development plan.
The Third National Development plan spanned between 1975–1980. It made bigger and more ambitious investment programs in various projects than the previous two. Coupled with several macroeconomic projections.

Dutch Athletics Championships

The Dutch Athletics Championships () is an annual outdoor track and field competition organised by the Royal Dutch Athletics Federation, which serves as the national championship for the sport in the Netherlands. It is typically held as a two- or three-day event in the Dutch summer, ranging from late June to early August. The venue of the championships varies, though Amsterdam's Olympic Stadium has been a regular host.
Established in 1910 as a men-only competition, the programme expanded to include women's events in 1921.
Events.
The current track and field programme features a total of 38 individual Dutch Championship athletics events, divided evenly between the sexes.
Men competed in the 200 metres hurdles up to the 1978 championships and women competed in that discipline in 1973 only. On some occasions, national club competitions in 4 × 100 metres relay and 4 × 400 metres relay are contested at the national championships.
The women's programme expanded inline with international acceptance of women's athletics. The women's 1500 metres was added in 1967 and 3000 metres followed in 1974 (and remained on the programme up to 1994). The 80 metres hurdles was held until 1968, after which it was replaced by the international standard 100 metres hurdles. A women's 400 m hurdles was first held in 1976. The last women's pentathlon was contested in 1980 and was then replaced by the new heptathlon event. The women's equivalents of the men's standard 5000 m and 10,000 m were added in 1981. Later additions to the women's programme were triple jump (1991), pole vault and hammer throw (1995) and the steeplechase (2002) – the final addition bringing women to parity of events in track and field.
Dutch championships in cross country running, racewalking, the half marathon, marathon, 100 kilometres run and 24-hour run are all conducted separately.

Grand Prix motorcycle racing sponsorship liveries

Grand Prix motorcycle racing sponsorship liveries have been used since the late 1960s, replacing the previously used national colours. With sponsors becoming more important with the rising costs in the motorcycle CC classes, many teams wanted to be able to display the logos of their sponsors as clearly as possible.
The liveries are usually changed for every season in the sport, marking the marketing ideas of the sponsors. Some teams keep some consistency over the years however, like the red colour of Ducati, which has its origin in a shade of red known as rosso corsa being the national racing colour of Italy. Tobacco and alcohol advertising was common in motorsport, however as bans spread throughout the world, teams used an alternate livery which alluded to the tobacco or alcohol sponsor, or entirely eliminated their name when in nations with a ban – this is now only seen on Ducati's Marlboro sponsored vehicles – where the sponsor is technically banned from advertising in all host nations. At historical events, bikes are allowed to use the livery which was used when the bike was actively competing.
SKY VR46 MotoGP.
The SKY Racing Team VR46 is a motorcycle racing team owned by Valentino Rossi and based in Tavullia (Marche, Italy). The team enters Grand Prix motorcycle racing in the Moto2 category with Kalex chassis and previously in Moto3 category with KTM RC250GP motorcycles. The team manager is the former road racer Pablo Nieto. The team has collected 24 wins (9 in Moto3 and 15 in Moto2) and one riders' championship (with Bagnaia in 2018). Expandedto MotoGP in 2021 with Avintia Racing
Ángel Nieto Team.
Ángel Nieto Team (formerly Aspar Racing Team) is a Grand Prix motorcycle racing team from Spain, currently competing in the MotoGP and Moto3 World Championships.
In the 2010 season the Aspar team entered the MotoGP class with Héctor Barberá, who finished in twelfth place aboard a Ducati Desmosedici GP10. Simón finished in second place in the inaugural Moto2 campaign, with teammate Mike Di Meglio finishing in twentieth place. Both riders started the season on Honda-powered RSV Motors frames, switching to a Suter chassis after two races. Nicolás Terol finished in second place in the 125cc class while his teammate Bradley Smith finished fourth, both riding Aprilia RSA 125 motorcycles.
Barberá remained with the team for 2011, recording a best result of 6th at the Spanish Grand Prix. The team expanded to two bikes in 2012, switching from Ducati to ART. Aleix Espargaró and Randy de Puniet dominated the recently created CRT (Claiming Rule Teams) class for two straight years. In 2014, Aspar entered two Honda bikes, after hiring former World Champion Nicky Hayden to partner Hiroshi Aoyama. The duo scored points regularly, but Espargaró claimed a 3rd straight title in the CRT class with Forward Racing. Irishman Eugene Laverty joined the team in 2015, the last year for Hayden in the World Championship before switching to the Superbike World Championship.
Before the 2018 season began, the team changed their name from Aspar Racing Team to Ángel Nieto Team, as a tribute by former team principal Jorge Fernandez to his former compatriot Ángel Nieto. The team also announced Ángel's son Gelete as the new team principal.
Aprilia.
Despite being a relatively small company by global motorcycling standards, Aprilia is very active in motorcycle sports. It contested many Road Racing formulae, including the now-defunct 125, 250 and 500cc Grand Prix classes of the FIM World Championship. From 2002 to 2004 they participated in the FIM MotoGP World Championship, and from 1999 to 2002 they participated in the FIM Superbike World Championship. Aprilia has returned to World Superbike since the 2009 season and in MotoGP since the 2012 season.
Aprilia made their international racing debut in the Motocross World Championship competing in the 125cc class from 1976 until 1981 with a best result being a fifth place in the 1979 season with rider Corrado Maddi. The firm then focused on the Grand Prix road racing world championships in 1985 and since then it has seen varying successes. Aprilia won their first world championship race at the 1991 Czechoslovak motorcycle Grand Prix with rider Alessandro Gramigni winning the 125cc race. In 1992 they won their first road racing world championship with Gramigni winning the 125cc class. They continued to be successful in the smaller displacement categories, winning numerous races and championships in the 125 and 250cc Grand Prix classes.
However, their 500 cc Grand Prix bikes failed to attain the same success. They began campaigning in the 500cc class in 1994 with a 250 V twin motor enlarged to 380cc in hopes of using its lighter weight and nimble handling as an advantage against the heavier, V4 engine bikes used by the competition. The bike eventually displaced 430cc and had its best result with a third place by rider Doriano Romboni at the 1997 Dutch TT but, could never overcome power disadvantage during the starting line sprint and was withdrawn at the end of the 1997 season for further development. Their first MotoGP effort, dubbed the Aprilia RS Cube, was technically advanced but difficult to ride and performed poorly in the championship. The Cube did, however, pioneer many advanced technologies including ride by wire throttle and pneumatic valve actuation systems. Aprilia left the MotoGP class at the end of 2004 and then left the lower classes when two-stroke engines were banned. Aprilia set the record for the most points earned by a manufacturer in a single season from the 125cc class with 410 points in 2007. It was also the highest points earned by a constructor in Grand Prix motorcycle racing's history until 2011 when 420 points were won by the same bikes winning 16 out of 17 races.
Aprilia rejoined the MotoGP class in 2012, taking advantage of the newly introduced Claiming Rule Team category that encouraged independent teams with lower budgets to use bikes from manufacturers not officially involved in MotoGP. Aprilia supplied RSV4 SBK-derived bikes under the ART (Aprilia Racing Technology) name to Aspar, Paul Bird Motorsport and Speed Master teams. In both the 2012 and 2013 seasons Aprilia's ART machinery stood out as the best CRT bikes.
For 2015 Aprilia returned to the world championship with a factory effort.
Avintia Racing.
Avintia Racing is a motorcycle racing team currently competing in the MotoGP World Championship.
In 2012 the team changed its name to Avintia Racing, following an alliance between BQR and the Grupo Avintia. The team debuted in the MotoGP class as a Claiming Rule Team using both FTR Moto and Inmotec frames badged as BQR, powered by Kawasaki engines. The riders were Iván Silva and Yonny Hernández. In 2013 Avintia entered the MotoGP class with Kawasaki-engined FTR frames, fielding two bikes for Hiroshi Aoyama and Héctor Barberá.
For the 2014 season Aoyama was replaced by Mike Di Meglio and the team fielded a new bike badged as the Avintia GP14, reportedly based on the 2007-2009 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-RR with some input from Kawasaki. Following a mid-season agreement between Avintia and Ducati, Barberá received an Open-specification Ducati Desmosedici for the last five rounds.
In 2015 the team entered two Open class Desmosedici GP14 motorcycles, for Barberá and Di Meglio. For 2016 Di Meglio was replaced by Loris Baz. In 2017 the team changed its name to Reale Esponsorama Racing.
Cagiva.
At the end of the 1970s, Cagiva began campaigning the Grand Prix motorcycle racing circuit. Randy Mamola was its lead rider from 1988 to 1990, and he achieved Cagiva’s first podium result. The company would also have some technical assistance from Yamaha. In 1991 it signed former world champion Eddie Lawson to its team. Lawson would claim the company's first victory when he won the 1992 Hungarian Grand Prix. John Kocinski would also win a Grand Prix on a Cagiva GP500 (C594), finishing third in the 1994 world championship. While Kocinski had the best results to date on the Cagiva in 1994, the company withdrew at the end of the season. The bike made one appearance in 1995 at the Italian Grand Prix, where Pierfrancesco Chili finished 10th.
Overall, the Cagiva team had achieved 3 victories, 11 podiums, 6 pole position and 3 fastest laps in the 500cc.
Ducati.
When the MotoGP technical rules changed in the 2002 season, giving priority to four-stroke machinery, Ducati decided to enter Grand Prix motorcycle racing.
Ducati's first MotoGP motorcycle was unveiled at the 2002 Italian GP at Mugello, for use in the 2003 MotoGP championship. Ducati began taking part in the MotoGP Championship in the 2003 season and won one title in the 2007 season. Ducati has collected 40 wins: 23 by Casey Stoner, 8 by Andrea Dovizioso 7 by Loris Capirossi and 1 each by Troy Bayliss and Andrea Iannone.
Honda Racing Corporation.
Honda Racing Corporation (HRC) is a division of the Honda Motor Company formed in 1982. The company combines participation in motorcycle races throughout the world with the development of high potential racing machines. Its racing activities are an important source for the creation of leading edge technologies used in the development of Honda motorcycles. HRC also contributes to the advancement of motorcycle sports through a range of activities that include sales of production racing motorcycles, support for satellite teams, and rider education programs.
In 1979, Honda returned to Grand Prix motorcycle racing with the monocoque-framed, four-stroke NR500. The FIM rules limited engines to four cylinders, so the NR500 had non-circular, 'race-track', cylinders, each with 8 valves and two connecting rods, in order to provide sufficient valve area to compete with the dominant two-stroke racers. Unfortunately, it seemed Honda tried to accomplish too much at one time and the experiment failed. For the 1982 season, Honda debuted their first two-stroke race bike, the NS500 and in 1983, Honda won their first 500 cc Grand Prix World Championship with Freddie Spencer. Since then, Honda has become a dominant marque in motorcycle Grand Prix racing, winning a plethora of top level titles with riders such as Mick Doohan and Valentino Rossi.
Kawasaki Motors Racing.
Kawasaki returned after an absence of 20 years at the 2002 Pacific motorcycle Grand Prix. Kawasaki, with their four-stroke Ninja ZX-RR, raced as wildcards in the last four races of the season as a preparation before entering the championship full-time in the following season.
In 2004, Shinya Nakano joined the team and managed to get the ZX-RR's first podium with a third place at the Japanese Grand Prix. In 2005, Olivier Jacque scored a second place at the Chinese Grand Prix. The next year Nakano finished second at the Dutch TT. In 2007, Randy de Puniet scored a second place at the Japanese Grand Prix. In 2008 John Hopkins and Anthony West rode the machine.
The ZX-RR struggled in 2008, with the best results being two fifth-place finishes from John Hopkins in Portugal and Anthony West in Brno. Hopkins and West blamed both a lack of feeling in the front end and rear traction on corner exit. Previous ZX-RRs have been difficult to ride, but beyond the limited statements by the riders it is unclear what the problems with the 2008 bike were.
In August 2008, Kawasaki signed Marco Melandri to join John Hopkins for the 2009 season. However, the global financial crisis of 2008 caused Kawasaki to reconsider its MotoGP program, and the Italian sports daily Tuttosport reported on December 30 that Kawasaki would be pulling out of MotoGP for 2009.
On January 9, 2009, Kawasaki announced it had decided to "... suspend its MotoGP racing activities from 2009 season onward and reallocate management resources more efficiently". The company stated that it will continue racing activities using mass-produced motorcycles as well as supporting general race oriented consumers.
KTM.
KTM AG (the former KTM Sportmotorcycle AG) is an Austrian motorcycle and sports car manufacturer owned by KTM Industries AG and Indian manufacturer Bajaj Auto. It was formed in 1992 but traces its foundation to as early as 1934. Today, KTM AG is the parent company of the KTM Group.
In 2003, KTM started sponsoring and supporting Road racing in various capacities, with the most successful results stemming from their Supermoto efforts. From 2003 to 2009, a KTM factory team competed in the 125cc class of the motorcycle Grand Prix, and between 2005 and 2008 in the 250cc class. Notable successes in the 125 cc class were the second and third place in the overall ranking scored in 2005 by KTM riders Mika Kallio and Gábor Talmácsi, the second place in 2006 by Mika Kallio, the third place in 2007 by Tomoyoshi Koyama and the 2005 KTM victory in the 125 cc constructor championship. In the 250 cc class, Mika Kallio won third place in 2008. Since the first Rookies Cup season in 2007, KTM has supplied the bike for the Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup. In 2009, KTM announced their withdrawal from Grand Prix motorcycle racing in all classes, and did not return until 2012 in the new Moto3 class.
In 2012, KTM won the Moto3 manufacturers' championship. During the next season, KTM riders prevailed in every race of the Moto3 class and won the world title as well as second and third place, making KTM the obvious victor of the manufacturers' standing. KTM won the manufacturer title in the 2014 and 2016 as well as the world title in 2016 in the Moto3 class. Starting in 2017, KTM fields bikes in both MotoGP and Moto2 classes as well. The main class team features Bradley Smith and Pol Espargaró as full-season riders, and Mika Kallio as wildcard rider. The Moto2 KTM Ajo team features Miguel Oliveira and Brad Binder.

Suzuki MotoGP.
Suzuki MotoGP is the official factory-backed team of Suzuki in the MotoGP World Championship. Suzuki first entered a works team in the 500cc Grand Prix World Championship in 1974 with riders Barry Sheene and Findlay riding the Suzuki RG500. A second-place finish by Sheene in the opening round was the best result of the season. The team's first victory came in 1975, a pole-to-finish win by Barry Sheene at the Dutch TT. Sheene finished the season 6th overall with two wins.
Barry Sheene won the riders' championship in 1976 with a total of five wins. Sheene's second 500cc riders' championship came in 1977 with six wins. Teammate Steve Parrish was fifth.
Marco Lucchinelli became the 500cc World Champion in 1981, riding the new Suzuki RG 500 gamma for the Roberto Gallina racing team. Lucchinelli left Suzuki to join Honda in 1982. He was replaced on the Gallina team by Franco Uncini who went on to win the World Championship with five wins. Uncini was severely injured at the Dutch TT at Assen in 1983 and was unable to defend his title. Suzuki withdrew factory support at the end of the season.
After three years away Suzuki returned in 1987 with factory supported entries. While not a full-time return, riders Takumi Itoh and Kevin Schwantz had some good results aboard the new Suzuki RGV500. Suzuki made a full return to racing in 1988 with Schwantz finishing 8th overall with two wins whilst teammate Rob McElnea finished the season in 10th place. With a total of six wins, Schwantz was ranked fourth for the 1989 season.

For the 2011 season, the team fielded only one GSV-R for Álvaro Bautista with no replacement for Loris Capirossi, who moved to the Pramac Racing team. At the end of 2011 Suzuki pulled out of MotoGP citing the need to reduce costs amid the global economic downturn.
On 30 September 2014 Suzuki Motor Corporation announced that it would participate in MotoGP from 2015, with Aleix Espargaró and Maverick Viñales as their two riders. They raced a newly developed MotoGP machine, the GSX-RR, with a restructured team organisation led by Davide Brivio.
Team LCR.
Team LCR is a motorcycle racing team currently competing in the MotoGP World Championship under the name LCR Honda. The team was founded in 1996 by Italian rider Lucio Cecchinello. In 2015, they were represented by British rider Cal Crutchlow on a factory-specification Honda RC213V bike, and Australian rookie Jack Miller, riding an open-specification Honda RC213V-RS. However, the team downgraded to a single bike for Crutchlow in 2016, as Miller moved to the Estrella Galicia 0,0 Marc VDS Team.
Tech 3.
Tech 3 is a motorcycle racing team currently competing in the MotoGP World Championship under the name Monster Yamaha Tech 3 and in the Moto2 World Championship under the name Tech 3 Moto2.
Tech 3 functions as a junior team to the Movistar Yamaha MotoGP Team, with the aim of developing the skills of promising riders for the senior team. The team was founded by ex-racer Hervé Poncharal, engineer Guy Coulon and Bernard Martignac and started racing in 1990 in the 250 cc class, using Honda and Suzuki motorcycles. In 1999, the team partnered with Yamaha for the factory team and in 2000 their riders, Olivier Jacque and Shinya Nakano, placed first and second in the 250 world championship. In 2001 the team moved the whole operation to the premier class, again with Yamaha, Jacque and Nakano on the YZR500,"MotoGP – Tech 3 Yamaha". though their status changed to that of satellite team through to the present.
Towards the end of the 2002 season, the team was given use of the YZR-M1. In 2006 and 2007 the team used Dunlop tyres, but returned to Michelin in 2008. In the 2008 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season, the two-time and reigning Superbike World Champion James Toseland partnered with the two-time Superbike World Champion Colin Edwards. For 2010, Ben Spies replaced Toseland. Spies finished the season in sixth place while Edwards finished in eleventh place. In the new Moto2 category, Tech 3 rider Yuki Takahashi finished the season in twelfth place while Raffaele De Rosa finished 27th, aboard Honda-powered bikes using a Tech 3 chassis.

Innoson Group vs GTBank fraud case

The Innoson Group vs GTBank fraud case involves claims where plaintiff Innoson Motors claims that GT Bank owes Innoson Motors a large sum of money that after 22% interest compounded annually over several years totals ₦8.9 billion. However, the Nigerian government is also investigating claims that Innoson Motors is guilty of fraud. Innoson Motors began its case against GT Bank in 2011. Recently, the Nigerian Supreme Court ruled in favor of Innoson Motors claim against GT Bank, and the company says that it is due to take over GT Bank in lieu of receiving its money.
The scandal received publicity after the arrest of the Innonson chairman by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. Innoson took the dispute to social media, with hashtags such as #BewareOfGTBank and #WhatIsWrongWithGTBank. In a TVC News interview, Innocent Chukwuma said that he had obtained an ₦8 billion judgement against the bank.
In 2009, GTBank extended credit to Innoson; under loan terms agreed to by Chukwuma on behalf of Innoson, proprietary interest in imported goods was exclusively that of the bank. The original shipping documents were in the bank's custody, and ownership could only be transferred to Innoson (or any other third party) by the bank when the conditions of the agreement were fulfilled. Chukwuma approached the bank on behalf of Innoson for the documents, and was refused due to Innoson's failure to meet the agreed conditions; however, the bank noticed in June 2011 that the imported goods had been procured by Innoson without their consent. The bank’s endorsement of the bills of lading to the shipping line had been forged. GTBank reported the forgery to the Nigeria Police Force, who began an investigation. After a forensic examination of the disputed signatures, the police established that the signatures of the bank’s staff were forged and the imported goods were fraudulently cleared from the Nigerian Ports Authority.
According to a 10 November 2017 Innoson Group press release, the company was a GTBank customer. The issue dated back to 2012, when the bank "arbitrarily imposed and debited [their] current account in excessive and unlawful charges". Innoson sued GTBank, and several judgements were appealed by both sides. In 2013/2014, GTBank owed Innoson Motors up to ₦8.5 billion. Innoson's claims on the judgement were debunked in media reports, with journalists covering the story confirming that the company's only judgement against Guaranty Trust Bank was obtained at the Federal High Court in Awka (which controversially awarded Innoson ₦4.7 billion). Its appeal has been pending at the Court of Appeal in Enugu for several years, due to Innoson's efforts to block the hearing.
A 25 December 2017 Innoson press release stated that GTBank had never granted Innoson a ₦2.4 billion 2009 loan, but a ₦500 million loan in an offer letter dated 17 December 2009; their last loan transaction was in 2011. The principal terms and security for the loan were: legal/tripartite legal mortgage over Innoson’s properties, valued at ₦1.1 billion in 2010 by GTB-appointed appraisers; a 25-percent equity contribution by Innoson on each letter-of-credit (LC) transaction, and shipping documents worth ₦500 million could be released at any time to Innoson. On 13 June 2018, Innoson admitted distorting the Supreme Court directive in its case with GTBank and apologised for misleading the public with their false claim of a Supreme Court Order against Guaranty Trust Bank.
Investigation.
A Nigeria Police Force investigation following a September 2013 petition by the bank confirmed that Innoson and Chukwuma deliberately set out to defraud, steal from the bank and convert the imported goods belonging to the bank through forgery and misrepresentation, and Chukwuma was charged by the police.
EFCC.
Chukwuma was arrested at his home in Enugu on 19 December 2017 and interrogated in Lagos about the alleged scandal. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission said that Chukwuma was arrested for fraud at the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and for forging documents to obtain tax waivers. The company denied the allegations, saying that the EFCC had never investigated Innoson.
Courts.
In January 2018, Justice Mojisola Dada ordered the EFCC to subpoena Chukwuma after his attorney attempted to justify his absence at the Lagos State High Court in Ikeja for his scheduled arraignment. According to the EFCC, the businessman was evading arrest.
In June 2018, Ikeja Special Offences Court Judge Mojisola Dada ordered the arrest of Chukwuma wanted for failing to appear before the court for arraignment for the fifth time. Chukwuma had previously failed to appear in court on 17 January, 9 February, 14 March and 25 April.
In 2014, a ₦4.7 billion judgment was awarded to Innoson by a judge at the Federal High Court in Awka. Guaranty Trust Bank immediately appealed the judgment, calling it "ridiculous" at the Court of Appeal in Enugu. The Court of Appeal asked the Bank to place the judgment in an interest-bearing escrow account with the court’s registrars. The bank balked, offering the court a guarantee instead and appealing to the Supreme Court.
The bank's appeal was heard at the Supreme Court in Abuja on 7 June 2018. The court sided with GTBank, paving the way for the bank’s appeal of the Akwa High Court judgment at the Court of Appeal in Enugu. That hearing, on 14 June, was adjourned by the court until a date to be determined later.

Plate Tectonics Revolution

The Plate Tectonics Revolution was the scientific and cultural change which developed from the acceptance of the plate tectonics theory. The event was a paradigm shift and scientific revolution.
By 1966 most scientists in geology accepted the theory of plate tectonics. The root of this was Alfred Wegener's 1912 publication of his theory of continental drift, which was a controversy in the field through the 1950s. At that point scientists introduced new evidence in a new way, replacing the idea of continental drift with instead a theory of plate tectonics. The acceptance of this theory brought scientific and cultural change which commentators called the "Plate Tectonics Revolution".
Response.
In 1975 a paper said that "plate tectonics" gained general acceptance in its field in 1968 and called that acceptance a revolution.
One scientist said that the Plate Tectonics Revolution brought excitement among scientists in the field in the 1960s.
Publications in generations after the event reflected on how the Plate Tectonics Revolution was an early example of data science.
One commentator claimed that the plate tectonics theory became popular and established a revolution in culture even before scientists could confirm some of the claims for which evidence was lacking.
There are claims that science in Russia was a significant contribution to the Plate Tectonics Revolution, but Western bias against Russia has blocked recognition of their contributions.

West German Athletics Championships

The West German Athletics Championships () was an annual outdoor track and field competition organised by the German Athletics Association, which served as the West German national championships for the sport. The two- or three-day event was held in summer months, varying from late June to early August, and the venue changed annually.
The German Athletics Championships had a long history, dating back to 1898. After the division of Germany at the end of World War II, the organising body of the all-Germany championships, the German Athletics Association, remained in West Germany. As a result, when the national championships resumed in 1946, only West German athletes could compete in them. This prompted the creation of the East German Athletics Championships.
Events.
The following athletics events were held at the West German Championships:
100 metres, 200 metres, 400 metres, 800 metres, 1500 metres, 3000 metres (women only), 5000 metres (men only), 10,000 metres, marathon
100 metres hurdles (women only), 110 metres hurdles (men only), 400 metres hurdles, 3000 metres steeplechase (men only)
Pole vault (men only), high jump, long jump, triple jump (men only)
Shot put, discus throw, javelin throw, hammer throw (men only)
Decathlon (men only), heptathlon (women only)
A men's 200 metres hurdles was held up to the 1965 championships, and a men's pentathlon was on the combined events programme through 1973.
Women's events expanded with the international acceptance of women's athletics. The women's 1500 metres was added in 1968, 3000 metres in 1973, and 10,000 mw ten years later. The 80 metres hurdles was held until 1968, when it was replaced by the international standard 100 metres hurdles. A women's 400 m hurdles was first held in 1975. The last women's pentathlon was held in 1980, then replaced by the new heptathlon event. Women's triple jump, pole vault, hammer throw and steeplechase were not held, as they were not yet standard international events.

MATCH International Women's Fund

MATCH International Women's Fund is a non-profit, non-governmental organization based in Ottawa, Canada, dedicated to funding women's rights movements and grassroots organizations working on women's rights worldwide with a particular interest in the global South. Since the organization's founding in 1976 by two Canadian women, MATCH International has helped women's rights organizations in 71 countries with investments totalling $12 million for improvement of women and girls rights. In 2013, the organization re-launched under the name MATCH International Women's Fund with the same aim to invest in women and girls in the global South. As the only international women's fund in Canada, their motto is, "Holding Ground and Breaking Ground" on women's, girl's, and transgender rights. The organization's funding comes from individual donors, corporate partners, and the government of Canada.
History.
Before 2013, the MATCH International Women's Fund was the MATCH Fund launched in 1976 by Dr. Norma E. Walmsley and Ms. Suzanne Johnson-Harvor with similar objectives of supporting women's movements worldwide. They became inspired to found an organization that supports grassroots women's organizations in the global South after attending the 1975 UN Conference for Women in Mexico City. The MATCH Fund was the first organization of its kind that 'matched' the needs of Canadian women with the similar needs in the global South, as well as being the first international nongovernmental organization that focused on women in the global south.
In 2010, the Fund was on the verge of closing due to severe budget cuts from the Canadian International Development Agency, but never did. After reevaluating its role in the ever-changing landscape of women's rights and development work, the Fund concluded that there was still an organizational need for a focus on grassroots women's movements in developing countries.
In 2011, with the help of donor support and the World University Service of Canada, the MATCH International Women's Fund underwent its rebranding to become Canada's first international women's fund with a focus on social innovation. In 2013, the Fund relaunched as MATCH International Women's Fund, the first and only Canadian Fund focused on women. This successful rebranding was possible because of their heightened voice thanks to corporate brand developers and public relations and advertisement firms.
The feminist organization has partnered with 71 countries and more than 650 organizations since its founding.
Structure.
At the head of operations of MATCH International Women's Fund is President and CEO, Jess Tomlin, who joined the organization in 2012 and has led the MATCH International Fund into its new phase. She is followed by a Vice President of Finance and Operations, Vice President of Capital Development, and Vice President of Global Programs. Other key positions are Finance Office, Senior Communication Strategist, Financial Analyst, Executive Coordinator, Development Assistant, Manager Global Programs, and Policy Lead.
The Fund has a Board of Directors who is composed of a Chair, Vice-Chair and Secretary, Treasurer, and nine Directors.
The MATCH International's Women's Fund's structure is also composed of an Advisory Council with a total of fifteen members with diverse expertise in women's rights, leadership, media, innovation, entrepreneurship, and peace and security; specific names can be found on the MATCH International website.
Funding.
As a non-profit, non-governmental organization, the Fund obtains its founding from private individual Canadian donors, other Canadian organizations and foundations, and the Federal government of Canada. The money from their funding is brought directly to the women's organizations that they provide grants to. The Fund's financial highlights can be found on the non-profit organization's 2016-2017 Strength in Numbers Report.
Individual donors.
The MATCH International Women's Fund's funding comes from individual Canadian donors. Last year, the MATCH private donors contribute almost $2 million to their annual budget.
Private sector.
The MATCH International Women's Fund has corporate partners including Cairns O'Neil Strategic Media, Citizen Relations, The Colony Project, and Fish Out of Water Design Inc., Eastern Ontario Women in Finance, and Telus Corporation. The MATCH International Women's Fund considers its high impact private sector partners vital to its success, especially during its rebranding and 2013 launch.
Foundations.
The MATCH International Women's Fund also has donor foundations including Foundations Canadian Federation of University Women, Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario, Foundation for a Just Society, Institute for International Women’s Rights - Manitoba, LesLois Shaw Foundation, McLean Smits Foundation, Sisters of St. Joseph of the Diocese of London Foundation, Terrace Women and Development Collective, The Red Butterfly Foundation, The Cloverleaf Foundation, University of Winnipeg Foundation, Wellspring Advisors, Women’s Executive Network Foundation.
Canadian government.
The MATCH International Women's Fund, as well as other women's organizations like the Nobel Women’s Initiative, have been pressuring the Canadian federal government to fund international grassroots organizations for women's advancement. In 2017, the Trudeau government announced a new feminist international development policy as part for the Canadian foreign aid program that would find new ways to reach smaller organizations and groups while being accountable to the taxpayers. Both organizations advocated for these small amounts to grassroots organizations to be passed through their non-profit organizations.
Mission.
The MATCH International Women's Fund's motto is "Holding Ground and Breaking Ground". This is linked to their mission that is the support small grassroots women's organizations that are holding ground and breaking ground in their respective country. By changing societal beliefs, opening barriers and systems through funding of other organizations, MATCH International Fund's mission is to improve women, girls, and transgender rights.
President and CEO, Jess Tomlin, explains "Our mandate is to get money into the hands of women’s organizations who are really working at the community level, and we’re particularly curious about investing in disruptive and innovated organizations".
Values.
The non-governmental organization's (NGO) values include courage, ambition, tenacity, feminisms, innovation, agility, and collaboration, with the ultimate goal to put a stop to discrimination and violence against women and girls.
Activities.
The main activities of MATCH International Women's Fund includes the funding of grassroots organizations worldwide, sharing the stories of these organizations and the women behind them. By funding grassroots organizations and sharing their stories, MATCH International Women's Fund brings change in more than 25 countries.
Grants.
The MATCH International Women's Fund is a new model of giving as it supports women's rights work globally through funding. The MATCH International Women's Fund's main activity is to support grassroots women's organizations in developing countries through the giving of grants. These capacity building grants are given to small organizations that work towards systematic change through collaboration and innovation, or through services and programs that promote and sustain women's rights. These grants range between 10,000 CAD to 20,000 CAD and proposals for grant demands are open once a year.
These grants to grassroots organizations allow for flexible funding as the partners directly communicate with the Fund's staff for their needs. The MATCH Fund's responsive funding to these grassroots organizations allows for new innovative ideas and resistance. The Fund also seeks to magnify the voices of their partners by sharing their stories, promoting their work, connecting to opportunities, and support.
Campaigns.
The MATCH International Women's Fund most prominent advocacy campaign is the #NoWomanFairytale, which is focused on three important topics: child marriage, rape and female genital mutilation. By funding and partnering with different gras-root women organizations worldwide, the MATCH Fund want to alleviate these controversial practices. Each story ends with "And, little by little, the harmful practice of child marriage/rape/female genital mutilation came to an end", thanks to the work of women in grass-root organizations, which MATCH funds.
On the Fund's website, MATCH has created a "how many laws did you break today?" quiz that brings awareness to the socio-cultural differences between Canadian women and women in the Global South. By asking regular, banal questions such as "When you left your house today, did you tell a man where you’re going?" or "What did you wear to work today?" in order to show that in other parts of the world, fundamental human rights are denied. The quiz ends with a number of laws that the respondent would have broke in a country of the global south, along with the penalties of breaking those laws such as imprisonment, lashes, electric shocks, arbitrary arrests, death threats, harassment, and death. The quiz ends with MATCH asking for the respondent to pay their fine (i.e. a donation).
Their #LotteryOfLife quiz, launched in 2016, aims to increase awareness on the life of women and girls in the global south. By taking this quiz based on some of your basic personal information (age, education, gender, etc.), the quiz tells you where you would be in the developing world.
Another digital quiz found on the Fund's website titled "Why Are We Still Protesting This Sh*!?" (launched in 2017) questions one's knowledge on past and present women's marches and protests through pictures. At the end of the quiz, the fact that women have been fighting and activating for rights for decades is paralleled by women in the developing world this fighting for rights and against culturally adopted practices.
These three quizzes above are part of MATCH's campaign for awareness have been taken by more than 550,000 people since their launches.
A 2018 initiative can be found on the organization's website, it is titled Resting Stitch Face. This is another initiative to increase awareness of the issues, in this case sexism, that women face. Here, cross-stitch is used to write sexist sayings, once the saying is chosen, backgrounds and colours to personalize the saying are picked. Then, the possibility to share your personal cross-stitch on social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest), download it or email it to yourself.
Social innovation.
It was, President and CEO, Jess Tomlin that became interested in social innovation and the advantages it could bring to women's rights issues. The fact that MATCH is innovative makes it the "first social innovation fund for women globally". Instead of funding infrastructure and large organizations, the MATCH International Women's Fund believe that smaller grassroots women's organizations and their initiatives will bring about more meaningful change. As Muhungi and Edwards claim, the MATCH International Women's Fund is an innovation in itself as the first international fund focused on women in Canada.
The non-governmental organization works with 25 organizations across the world by funding a variety of projects such as an organization that work with survivors of sexual violence in Mexico, an organization that creates LGBT documentaries in Georgia, an organization that created an app to help Rwandan women during pregnancy, or even women-led tourist initiatives. Other innovative solution for women issues is Kenya’s Boxgirls, an organization that trains girls in rural areas as a way to empower them. In India, Nidhi Goyal is a blind stand-up comedian that encourages equality and acceptance through her comedy, the MATCH International Women's Fund supported Nidhi in the creation of an application that connected disabled women to volunteer caregivers. Another innovation is the Mama Radio, a Congolese radio show about women issues that helps spread the word on rights, abuses, and equality.
Membership.
Win-Win Coalition &amp; Win-Win Strategies.
The MATCH International Women's Fund is also a founding member of the Win-Win Coalition, which advocates and supports for the empowerment and advancement of women by adding resources and by cross-sector collaboration. The Win-Win Strategies partners with the assets of funds and organizations to empower women globally through business. By using the knowledge and resources of funds and organizations with their own services of business building, such as connections, consultations, development, and building sectors.
Women's Funding Network.
The MATCH International Women's Fund is a member of the Women's Funding Network (WFN), which is an international alliance made up of 145 women's funds.
Partners.
The MATCH International Women's Fund as a total of 25 partners as of early 2018. These are the partners that are receiving grants and funds by the International Fund for 2016-2017.
Recognition.
In 2017, the MATCH International Women's Fund won a Communications Management award by the International Association of Business Communicators and in 2015 won an award on innovation by the Canadian Council on International Co-operation. In the same year, the MATCH International Fund's President and CEO, Jess Tomlin, was awarded the Gold Stevie award for "Most Innovative Woman of the Year - Government or Non-Profit".

Portumna Abbey

Portumna Abbey is a medieval Cistercian (and later Dominican) friary and National Monument located in Portumna, Ireland.
Location.
Portumna Abbey is located south of Portumna town centre, immediately east of Portumna Castle and on the north edge of Lough Derg.
History.
A chapel dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul was founded by Cistercian monks in 1254, dependent on Dunbrody Abbey, County Wexford.
The Cistercian foundation declined and was replaced with a Dominican friary dedicated to Saint Mary Assumed into Heaven, Peter and Paul, founded in 1426 by Murchad Ó Madáin of the powerful O'Madden lords of Síol Anmchadha.
Portumna was dissolved c. 1582 and granted to Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde.
The friary was reestablished in 1640, with Ambrose Ó Madadhan the first prior. Richard Ó Madadhan was prior in 1691, when the friars were forced to flee after the Battle of Aughrim. Anthony McHugo was the prior when the Dominicans were formally expelled on 1 May 1698. Some remained and by the early 18th century they had reoccupied the priory. McHugo died there on 24 July 1711. The friars continued to live in the area, at Boula and at Gortanumera up to the 19th century.
Part of the monastery was used as a Church of Ireland church in 1631. Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan married Honora Burke here on 9 January 1689, in the midst of the War of the Two Kings.
The choir was the local Church of Ireland place of worship between 1762 and 1810.
Buildings.
The church is long with nave and chancel separated by a tower. There is a large collection of medieval graveslabs and memorial plaques, and a piscinal.
On the northside is a cloister and sacristy, with some of the arcade reconstructed.

Fritz Cockerell (1889-1965) was a German pioneer of motorcycle, automotive and engine construction.
Biography.
Fritz Cockerell (born 25 November 1889 in Munich, died 16 April 1965) was a German pioneer of motorcycle, automotive and engine construction. His real name was Friedrich Gockerell, but in his published patent documents, he is referred to as Fritz Cockerell.
Fritz Cockerell initially worked as a machinist in an airship factory and later in steam turbine construction at Maffei. He then moved to Rapp Motorenwerke, which later became Bayerische Motorenwerke (BMW), where he worked as a test engineer. Later, with Hans Meixner and Otto Landgraf, he founded the Megola works in Munich for the production of the Megola motorcycle. This was characterized by a five-cylinder rotary engine in the front wheel and around 2,000 units were built. The Megola was added to the temporary exhibition "The art of the motorcycle" by the Guggenheim Museum in 1998.
Cockerell operated the and developed in-house an eight-cylinder two-stroke engine for a "German people-determined sports car" and a four-cylinder two-stroke engine, which was used for installation in a few prototypes of a car and a two-wheeler. Cockerell was more successful with auxiliary bike engines and light motorcycles, which were considered very reliable and sold under his own name. He later devoted himself to research on diesel engines for aircraft, turbine engines and the Wankel engine.

Château de Commequiers

The Château de Commequiers is a castle in Commequiers in Vendée, France. The original location and time of construction of the original castle is unknown. Some scholars claim it may have been built in the 11th century, at the same time as the châteaux of La Chaize-le-Vicomte and Tiffauges, under the commission of the Viscount of Thouars, who had influence over what are today the northern parts of Vendée.
The castle was constructed by Louis de Beaumont between the latter half of the 15th century and beginning of the 16th using white Sallertaine stone. In 1628, under orders from the cardinal de Richilieu, the castle was dismantled along with all other castles of its time in the region. It became property of historically Protestant nobles, the de la Trémoille family.
In 1926, the castle was registered as a historical monument. Each year, the organization “Friends of the old castle at Commequiers” organizes various events, including “Médievales”, a two-day festival including period costumes.
The earliest known lord of Commequiers (spelled Quemeiquiers at the time) is Urvoidus. In 1093, he participated in the foundation of the priory of Saint-Nicolas at Chaize-le-Vicomte by Aimery IV de Thouars. Urvoidus was almost certainly a vassal of the Thouars, and in 1099 was named Baron of Commequiers. His barony consisted of the parishes of Soullans, Saint-Christophe-du-Ligneron, Maché and le Perrier. Furthermore, five chatelaines were added including La Vérie, near Challans. Through an arranged marriage, the barony of Commequiers was added to the Lordship of Montaigue at the end of the 12th century. At the beginning of the 14th century, the new baron of Commequiers was the lord of Forêt-sur-Sèvres, Josselin.

Beatriz Barba

Beatriz Barba Ahuactzin (16 September 1928 – 29 January 2021) was a Mexican academic, anthropologist, and archaeologist, who was the second woman to earn a degree in archaeology in her country. She was a member of the National System of Researchers from 1985 and a member of the Mexican Academy of Sciences. Upon her fortieth anniversary of teaching, in 1991, she was honored with the gold Ignacio Altamirano Medal by the government of Mexico and the Secretariat of Education. In 2013, the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) paid tribute to her life's work.
Early life.
Beatriz Barba Ahuactzin was born on 16 September 1928 in Mexico City. Both of her parents were teachers and, from a young age, Barba wanted to become a teacher. She earned a degree at the "Escuela Nacional de Maestros" (National Teacher's College), in 1949, with a thesis that addressed the spinal deformities of students caused by inadequate structure of the furniture they used. Wanting to further her knowledge of history and prepare as a secondary teacher, she enrolled at the Escuela Nacional de Antropología e Historia (ENAH) in 1950. While there, she met archaeologist , whom she later would marry and with whom she would have three daughters.
Career.
Barba began her career teaching primary school in 1950, at the primary school, M-255 "Emiliano Zapata" while she worked on her thesis, entitled "Tlapacoya: un sitio preclásico de transición" (Tlapacoya: a pre-classic transitional site). Although she experienced some discrimination when doing field work, with workers not wanting to take orders from a woman, her husband was supportive as she persevered. In 1955, she received her master's degree, "cum laude", in anthropology and became the "first Mexican woman to obtain the title of archaeologist". Her thesis examined the social development and religious practices of the Tlatilco culture at the Tlapacoya archaeological site. 
Between 1957 and 1960, she taught history at Albert Einstein Secondary School Number Nine, while continuing her studies and earning her degree as an ethnologist from ENAH in 1960. She also worked as an adjunct professor at ENAH beginning in 1958, and conducted research in conjunction with her husband at sites in Tlatilco and in Valle de Guadalupe, Northern Jalisco.
In 1965, Barba founded the National Museum of Cultures in the building that previously, had served as a mint and then, as the Anthropological Museum. When a new building was created in 1964 for the National Museum of Anthropology, the former site was left vacant. Barba and professor Julio César Olivé pressed for the conversion of the building into a museum featuring world cultures. She served as the deputy director of the museum from 1965 to 1976, served as a guest lecturer in anthropology at the University of Guadalajara between 1972 and 1979, and from 1980, was a permanent lecturer for ENAH.
In 1982, Barba earned her master's degree in anthropological science from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and two years later, her Ph.D. degree. Her doctoral thesis, entitled "Ambiente social y mentalidad mágica en México, las bases del pensamiento mágico en el México precortesiano" (Social environment and mentality of magic in Mexico, the bases of magical thinking in pre-Cortesian Mexico), explored the indigenous cultural concept of magic before the Cortés conquest. Rather than the "demonic worship" depicted by Spaniards in their chronicles of Mexican culture, Barba's anthropological approach demonstrated that civilizations in ancient Mesoamerica had a reverence for the sacred, a devotion to creating books to pass on their extensive knowledge, and an appreciation of the vastness of universe. 
In 1984, her husband fell during an excavation at the Becán archaeological site and became paralyzed. Barba and colleagues encouraged Piña to continue to his work writing fundamental texts on Mexican archaeology, which he did until his 2001 death.
Barba was appointed a national researcher level II by the Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) in 1985 and, in 1991, was the recipient of the Ignacio Altamirano Medal, presented by SEP and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. From 1995, she led the permanent seminar on iconography for the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). In 2002, she became the founding president of the Mexican Academy of Anthropological Sciences. 
Upon her retirement in 2013, the National Institute of Anthropology and History paid homage to her career as a pioneering archaeologist and anthropologist. Thereafter, Barba taught privately from her home and compiled her husband's archives for the Universidad Autónoma de Campeche.
Barba died on 29 January 2021 at the age of 92.

Parallel all-pairs shortest path algorithm

A central problem in algorithmic graph theory is the shortest path problem. Hereby, the problem of finding the shortest path between every pair of nodes is known as all-pair-shortest-paths (APSP) problem. As sequential algorithms for this problem often yield long runtimes, parallelization has shown to be beneficial in this field. In this article two efficient algorithms solving this problem are introduced.
Another variation of the problem is the single-source-shortest-paths (SSSP) problem, which also has parallel approaches: Parallel single-source shortest path algorithm.
Problem definition.
Let formula_1 be a directed Graph with the set of nodes formula_2 and the set of edges formula_3. Each edge formula_4 has a weight formula_5 assigned. The goal of the all-pair-shortest-paths problem is to find the shortest path between all pairs of nodes of the graph. For this path to be unique it is required that the graph does not contain cycles with a negative weight.
In the remainder of the article it is assumed that the graph is represented using an adjacency matrix. We expect the output of the algorithm to be a distancematrix formula_6. In formula_6, every entry formula_8 is the weight of the shortest path in formula_9 from node formula_10 to node formula_11.
The Floyd algorithm presented later can handle negative edge weights, whereas the Dijkstra algorithm requires all edges to have a positive weight.
Dijkstra algorithm.
The Dijkstra algorithm originally was proposed as a solver for the single-source-shortest-paths problem. However, the algorithm can easily be used for solving the All-Pair-Shortest-Paths problem by executing the Single-Source variant with each node in the role of the root node.
In pseudocode such an implementation could look as follows:
 1 func DijkstraSSSP("G","v") {
 2 ... "//standard SSSP-implementation here"
 3 return "dv";
 5 
 6 func DijkstraAPSP("G") {
 7 "D" := |"V"|x|"V"|-Matrix
 8 for "i" from 1 to |"V"| {
 9 //"D[v] denotes the v-th row of D"
 10 "D"["v"] := DijkstraSSP("G","i")
In this example we assume that codice_1 takes the graph formula_9 and the root node formula_13 as input.
The result of the execution in turn is the distancelist formula_14. In formula_14, the formula_10-th element stores the distance from the root node formula_13 to the node formula_10.
Therefore the list formula_14 corresponds exactly to the formula_13-th row of the APSP distancematrix formula_6.
For this reason, codice_2 iterates over all nodes of the graph formula_9 and executes codice_1 with each as root node while storing the results in formula_6.
The runtime of codice_4 is formula_24 as we expect the graph to be represented using an adjacency matrix.
Therefore codice_2 has a total sequential runtime of formula_25.
Parallelization for up to |"V"| processors.
A trivial parallelization can be obtained by parallelizing the loop of codice_2 in line"8".
However, when using the sequential codice_4 this limits the number of processors to be used by the number of iterations executed in the loop.
Therefore, for this trivial parallelization formula_26 is an upper bound for the number of processors.
For example, let the number of processors formula_27 be equal to the number of nodes formula_26. This results in each processor executing codice_4 exactly once in parallel.
However, when there are only for example formula_29 processors available, each processor has to execute codice_4 twice.
In total this yields a runtime of formula_30, when formula_26 is a multiple of formula_27.
Consequently, the efficiency of this parallelization is perfect: Employing formula_27 processors reduces the runtime by the factor formula_27.
Another benefit of this parallelization is that no communication between the processors is required. However, it is required that every processor has enough local memory to store the entire adjacency matrix of the graph.
Parallelization for more than |"V"| processors.
If more than formula_26 processors shall be used for the parallelization, it is required that multiple processors take part of the codice_4 computation. For this reason, the parallelization is split across into two levels.
For the first level the processors are split into formula_26 partitions.
Each partition is responsible for the computation of a single row of the distancematrix formula_6. This means each partition has to evaluate one codice_4 execution with a fixed root node.
With this definition each partition has a size of formula_38 processors. The partitions can perform their computations in parallel as the results of each are independent of each other. Therefore, the parallelization presented in the previous section corresponds to a partition size of 1 with formula_39 processors.
The main difficulty is the parallelization of multiple processors executing codice_4 for a single root node. The idea for this parallelization is to distribute the management of the distancelist formula_14 in DijkstraSSSP within the partition. Each processor in the partition therefore is exclusively responsible for formula_41 elements of formula_14. For example, consider formula_43 and formula_44: this yields a partition size of formula_45. In this case, the first processor of each partition is responsible for formula_46, formula_47 and the second processor is responsible for formula_48 and formula_49. Hereby, the total distance lists is formula_50.
The codice_4 algorithm mainly consists of the repetition of two steps: First, the nearest node formula_51 in the distancelist formula_14 has to be found. For this node the shortest path already has been found.
Afterwards the distance of all neighbors of formula_51 has to be adjusted in formula_14.
These steps have to be altered as follows because for the parallelization formula_14 has been distributed across the partition:
The total runtime of such an iteration of codice_4 performed by a partition of size formula_69 can be derived based on the performed subtasks:
For formula_26-iterations this results in a total runtime of formula_74.
After substituting the definition of formula_69 this yields the total runtime for codice_2: formula_76 columns of the adjacency matrix.
A downside, however, is that this parallelization comes with a communication overhead due to the reduce- and broadcast-operations.
Example.
The graph used in this example is the one presented in the image with four nodes.
The goal is to compute the distancematrix with formula_44 processors.
For this reason, the processors are divided into four partitions with two processors each.
For the illustration we focus on the partition which is responsible for the computation of the shortest paths from node A to all other nodes.
Let the processors of this partition be named p1 and p2.
The computation of the distancelist across the different iterations is visualized in the second image.
The top row in the image corresponds to formula_78 after the initialization, the bottom one to formula_78 after the termination of the algorithm.
The nodes are distributed in a way that p1 is responsible for the nodes A and B, while p2 is responsible for C and D.
The distancelist formula_78 is distributed according to this.
For the second iteration the subtasks executed are shown explicitly in the image:
Floyd algorithm.
The Floyd algorithm solves the All-Pair-Shortest-Paths problem for directed graphs. With the adjacency matrix of a graph as input, it calculates shorter paths iterative. After |"V"| iterations the distance-matrix contains all the shortest paths. The following describes a sequential version of the algorithm in pseudo code:
 1 func Floyd_All_Pairs_SP("A") {
 2 formula_84 = "A";
 3 for "k" := 1 to "n" do
 4 for "i" := 1 to "n" do
 5 for "j" := 1 to "n" do
 6 formula_85
Where "A" is the adjacency matrix, "n" = |"V"| the number of nodes and "D" the distance matrix. For a more detailed description of the sequential algorithm look up Floyd–Warshall algorithm.
Parallelization.
The basic idea to parallelize the algorithm is to partition the matrix and split the computation between the processes. Each process is assigned to a specific part of the matrix. A common way to achieve this is 2-D Block Mapping. Here the matrix is partitioned into squares of the same size and each square gets assigned to a process. For an formula_86-matrix and "p" processes each process calculates a formula_87 sized part of the distance matrix. For formula_88 processes each would get assigned to exactly one element of the matrix. Because of that the parallelization only scales to a maximum of formula_89 processes. In the following we refer with formula_90 to the process that is assigned to the square in the i-th row and the j-th column.
As the calculation of the parts of the distance matrix is dependent on results from other parts the processes have to communicate between each other and exchange data. In the following we refer with formula_91 to the element of the i-th row and j-th column of the distance matrix after the k-th iteration. To calculate formula_91 we need the elements formula_93, formula_94 and formula_95 as specified in line 6 of the algorithm. formula_93 is available to each process as it was calculated by itself in the previous iteration.
Additionally each process needs a part of the k-th row and the k-th column of the formula_97 matrix. The formula_94 element holds a process in the same row and the formula_95 element holds a process in the same column as the process that wants to compute formula_91. Each process that calculated a part of the k-th row in the formula_97 matrix has to send this part to all processes in its column. Each process that calculated a part of the k-th column in the formula_97 matrix has to send this part to all processes in its row. All this processes have to do a one-to-all-broadcast operation along the row or the column. The data dependencies are illustrated in the image below.
For the 2-D block mapping we have to modify the algorithm as follows:
 1 func Floyd_All_Pairs_Parallel(formula_84) {
 2 for "k" := 1 to "n" do{
 3 Each process formula_90 that has a segment of the k-th row of formula_105,
 broadcasts it to the formula_106 processes;
 4 Each process formula_90 that has a segment of the k-th column of formula_105,
 broadcasts it to the formula_109 processes;
 5 Each process waits to receive the needed segments;
 6 Each process computes its part of the formula_110 matrix;
In line 5 of the algorithm we have a synchronisation step to ensure that all processes have the data necessary to compute the next iteration. To improve the runtime of the algorithm we can remove the synchronisation step without affecting the correctness of the algorithm. To achieve that each process starts the computation as soon as it has the data necessary to compute its part of the matrix. This version of the algorithm is called pipelined 2-D block mapping.
Runtime.
The runtime of the sequential algorithm is determined by the triple nested for loop. The computation in line 6 can be done in constant time (formula_111). Therefore, the runtime of the sequential algorithm is formula_112.
2-D block mapping.
The runtime of the parallelized algorithm consists of two parts. The time for the computation and the part for communication and data transfer between the processes.
As there is no additional computation in the algorithm and the computation is split equally among the "p" processes, we have a runtime of formula_113 for the computational part.
In each iteration of the algorithm there is a one-to-all broadcast operation performed along the row and column of the processes. There are formula_114 elements broadcast. Afterwards there is a synchronisation step performed. How much time these operations take is highly dependent on the architecture of the parallel system used. Therefore, the time needed for communication and data transfer in the algorithm is formula_115.
For the whole algorithm we have the following runtime:
Pipelined 2-D block mapping.
For the runtime of the data transfer between the processes in the pipelined version of the algorithm we assume that a process can transfer "k" elements to a neighbouring process in formula_117 time. In every step there are formula_118 elements of a row or a column send to a neighbouring process. Such a step takes formula_119 time. After formula_120 steps the relevant data of the first row and column arrive at process formula_121 (in formula_122 time).
The values of successive rows and columns follow after time formula_123 in a pipelined mode. Process formula_124 finishes its last computation after O(formula_125) + O(formula_126) time. Therefore, the additional time needed for communication in the pipelined version is formula_122.
The overall runtime for the pipelined version of the algorithm is:

Spanish Indoor Athletics Championships

The Spanish Indoor Athletics Championships () is an annual indoor track and field competition organised by the Royal Spanish Athletics Federation (RFEA), which serves as the Spanish national championship for the sport. Typically held over two days in February during the Spanish winter, it was first added to the national calendar in 1965, supplementing the main outdoor Spanish Athletics Championships held in the summer since 1917. It celebrated its 50th edition in 2014.
Events.
The following athletics events feature as standard on the Spanish Indoor Championships programme:
At the first three editions, non-standard distances of 600 metres, 1000 metres and 2000 metres were contested. A 5000 m race walk for men was introduced in 1979, while a women's 3000 m walk was contested from 1984. Racewalking events ceased to be part of the national championships after 1994. The men's combined event was an octathlon in 1981, 1982, 1987, 1988 and 1989. Women competed in a sextathlon instead of a pentathlon from 1981 through 1986.

Gu Shao

Gu Shao ( 188–218), courtesy name Xiaoze, was an official serving under the warlord Sun Quan in the late Eastern Han dynasty of China.
Family background.
Gu Shao's ancestral home was in Wu County, Wu Commandery, which is present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu. He was the eldest son of Gu Yong, who later became the second Imperial Chancellor of the state of Eastern Wu in the Three Kingdoms period.
The Gu clan, which he was from, was one of the four most influential clans in Wu Commandery and also in the Jiangdong region at the time.
Early life.
Gu Shao was well read in history and he took a keen interest in moral obligations between people. In his youth, he was as famous as his maternal uncle Lu Ji, and was considered to be of higher calibre as compared to other scions of notable families in Wu Commandery, such as Lu Xun, Zhang Dun (張敦) and Bu Jing (卜靜). Due to his fame and popularity, he attracted many visitors from throughout Wu Commandery and Yang Province who wanted to befriend him or build connections with him.
Gu Shao married a daughter of Sun Ce, the elder brother and predecessor of Sun Quan, the warlord who ruled over the territories in the Jiangdong region in the late Eastern Han dynasty and later became the founding emperor of Eastern Wu in the Three Kingdoms period. He probably also married a sister of Lu Xun and Lu Mao.
Meeting with Pang Tong.
When Zhou Yu died in 210, Pang Tong came to Wu Commandery to attend his funeral. As Pang Tong was famous in Wu Commandery, many people came to see him when he was about to leave. During this time, he met and befriended Lu Ji, Gu Shao and Quan Cong, and appraised each of them in turn. Pang Tong described Lu Ji as "a horse that cannot run fast but has strong willpower", and Gu Shao as "an ox that is physically weak but capable of bearing burdens over great distances". Someone then asked Pang Tong: "Does that mean Lu Ji is better than Gu Shao?" Pang Tong replied: "Although a horse can run fast, it can only bear the weight of one person. An ox can travel 300 "li" a day; it can certainly bear more than just the weight of one person!" Gu Shao later asked Pang Tong: "You are also known for being a good judge of character. Between us, who do you think is the better one?" Pang Tong replied: "I am not as good as you in associating with people and assessing their characters. However, when it comes to politics and strategy, it seems that I am one day ahead of you." Gu Shao agreed with Pang Tong and developed a close bond with him. Before Pang Tong left, Lu Ji and Gu Shao told him: "When peace is restored in the Empire, we want to have a good discussion with you about famous people."
Career.
Gu Shao started his career at the age of 26 after Sun Quan appointed him as the Administrator (太守) of Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi). When he reached Yuzhang, he paid his respects at the tomb of the hermit scholar Xu Ruzi and treated Xu Ruzi's descendants well. He also banned unorthodox practices and customs. During his tenure, he identified talents among the junior staff in his administration and sent them for education, in addition to promoting his subordinates to higher positions for good performance. He also made extensive efforts to strengthen education and Confucian culture in Yuzhang Commandery.
Among the various talents he identified and promoted, the more notable ones were Ding Xu (丁諝), Zhang Bing (張秉), Wu Can and Yin Li, all of whom came from humble and lowly backgrounds. Gu Shao earned praise for his good judgment of character when these men later achieved success in their careers: Ding Xu became a high-ranking military officer; Zhang Bing and Yin Li became commandery administrators; Wu Can became a tutor to the crown prince.
Gu Shao was also known for showing care and concern towards his friends and subordinates. When Zhang Bing's father or mother died, Gu Shao donned mourning garments and attended the funeral. On another occasion, when he was leaving Wu Commandery to assume office in Yuzhang Commandery, hundreds of people came to see him off. At the time, Zhang Bing was ill so he could not see Gu Shao off. Gu Shao told the people who came to see him off: "Zhang Bing is sick. He must be thinking that it's a pity that he can't bid me farewell. I will go to him instead. Please wait here for a while. I will be back soon."
Gu Shao died in office after serving as the Administrator of Yuzhang Commandery for five years. He was survived by two sons: Gu Tan and Gu Cheng.

Amenmose, son of Pendjerty

Amenmose, Son of Pendjerty (sometimes named Amenmessu) was a royal scribe from the time of Ramesses II. Amenmose was the son of the judge Pendjerty and the sistrum bearer of Amun, Mut and Khonsu, named Mutemonet.
Life and career.
A statue now in the British museum indicates that Amenmose's father Pendjerty was from "Iwny" (modern Esna). 
His mother's name is given as Mutemonet, and her name is shortened to Inty and Iny on different monuments. 
Several of the monuments Amenmose left behind show the goddess Neith in a place of prominence, which may be a reference to the birthplace of his father. Neith was worshipped in Esna. In his tomb in Thebes Amenmose is said to be not only a scribe, but also the Head of the Temples. This may indicate that he inspected temples. Hibachi mentions that this may explain why his monuments were found in so many different locations. 
Monuments.
Amenmose is known from several monuments:

Ewart Culpin

Ewart Gladstone Culpin (3 December 1877 – 1 December 1946) was a British Labour Party politician and town planner who served as the Chairman of London County Council.
Biography.
The son of Ben Ephraim Lamartine and Eliza Culpin, Ewart attended Alleynes Grammar School and Hitchin Grammar School. He became a journalist, based in Letchworth, where he developed an interest in town planning and the garden city movement. In 1906, he was appointed as secretary of the Garden City Association, and in 1907 he founded the International Garden Cities and Town Planning Association. Enthusiastic about the positions, in his spare time he qualified as a town planner and as an architect. Through the association, he promoted low-density housing schemes, whether designed as new towns or as extensions to existing ones, and in 1913 he toured the United States speaking on this topic. His approach was opposed by Ebenezer Howard, founder of the movement, and in 1918 he was replaced by Charles Purdom, who, like Howard, championed only new town developments.
After World War I, Culpin was president of the Belgian Society for the Reconstruction of Belgium, and he chaired the Standing Conference on London Regional Planning from 1926 until his death. In 1930, he was the president of the Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors, while in 1937/8 he was president of the Town Planning Institute. He also became a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects.
Culpin became active in the Labour Party, for which he stood unsuccessfully in Islington North at the 1924 United Kingdom general election. In 1925, he was appointed to London County Council as an alderman, serving until 1937, when he moved to become a councillor in Battersea North. He chaired the council from 1938 to 1939.
Culpin received several honours, including becoming an officer of the Belgian Order of the Crown, a grand officer of the Romanian Order of the Crown, and a commander of the Dahomean Order of the Black Star.

Trunk line 2 (Munich S-Bahn)

Trunk Line 2 () is an under-construction double track commuter rail tunnel in the Bavarian capital of Munich, Germany.
Background.
Nearly all lines of the Munich S-Bahn use the core route through the city centre in the underground, creating a bottle-neck responsible for long and increasingly frequent delays from even the smallest disruptions. The disadvantage of current core route is the inability of trains to reroute themselves onto different tracks in an event of disruption.
After years of discussions and studies into different route propositions, a second tunnel through the city centre has been already approved with the funding of €3.85 billion and the completion date of 2026. On 5 April 2017, the ground-breaking ceremony took place to commence the construction.
The second tunnel will be in length and run in parallel with the current tunnel in the south on the western portion of Hauptbahnhof and in the north on the eastern portion. It will have three underground stations (Hauptbahnhof, Marienhof, Ostbahnhof) and two surface stations (Laim and Leuchtenbergring). Marienhof, under construction to the north of Marienplatz, will be the only all-new station; other stations will be expanded to accommodate the new tunnel. With focus on express service and shorter travel time, the second tunnel will bypass six current stations between Laim and Ostbahnhof.
Most of express S-Bahn with limited stops will use the second tunnel: the proposed express S-Bahn routes are S18X (Herrsching-Leuchtenbergring), S21X (Landshut-Leuchtenbergring), S23X (Mering-Flughafen München), and S24X (Buchloe-Leuchtenbergring). Two of current S-Bahn routes will be transferred to the second tunnel upon the completion: S1 (Flughafen München/Freising-Ebersberg) and S6 (Tutzing-Leuchtenbergring).

Sargis Tmogveli

Sargis Tmogveli () or Sargis of Tmogvi was a 12th-13th century Georgian statesman and writer active during the reign of Queen Tamar ( 1184-1213). Sargis, son of Varam, belonged to the Tmogveli branch of the powerful Mkhargrdzeli family and owned estates in Tmogvi.
Tmogveli rendered the old Iranian love story "Vīs and Rāmīn" (written by Fakhruddin As'ad Gurgani) into Georgian prose; this Georgian version of the Persian original became known as "Visramiani".
Biography.
During a revolt of Queen Tamar's disgraced husband, George the Rus', around 1191, Sargis was one of the few nobles who remained loyal to the queen. For this he was kindly rewarded; he was given Tmogvi to secure frontier borders in Javakheti. In 1195 he participated in the Battle of Shamkor. In the 1200s, Shalva and Sargis Tmogveli, commanded the Georgian troops during the victorious campaign against Kars. In 1203 he fought in a campaign in the country of Dvin.

W. B. Whall

William Boultbee Whall (1847 – 1917) was a Master mariner, who compiled one of the first collections of English sea songs and shanties in 1910. He joined the Merchant Navy as a boy of 14 and learned the songs during 11 years aboard East Indiamen. In the foreword to his book he wrote that he thought the songs "worthy of preservation". In addition Whall wrote a number of books about navigation and practical seamanship.
Early years.
William Boultbee Whall was baptised on 31 January 1847 by his own father Revd William Whall, rector of St James the Great church in the hamlet of Thurning on the border between Northamptonshire and Huntingdonshire. His father, born in Lincoln in 1807, went to Emmanuel College Cambridge and remained as rector of Thurning for over 40 years (1833 till his death in 1874). His mother Mary Elizabeth Boultbee was born in Oxford in 1817, daughter of Revd Richard Moore Boultbee. William Jr was the eldest of 8 children and was initially "intended for the church, not for the sea". As a young boy, he was a chorister (1854–61) at Magdalen College Oxford where he happened to receive musical tuition from a young John Stainer. In 1860 Stainer was attached to the choir school as an organist and choirmaster at age 20. Perhaps because his voice broke, Whall left the choir school in 1861 to go to sea.
Maritime years.
Although the Royal Navy was revamping its training system at this time following the Pelham Commission of 1856, Whall preferred the Merchant Navy as a career choice and quickly achieved his Second mate certificate in 1867 in London and his First mate certificate in 1869. He became a Master mariner in 1878 and by 1901 was a nautical surveyor with the Board of Trade based at Wallasey on the River Mersey. By the 1911 census Whall, aged 64, was a Principal Officer at the Board of Trade in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales, supervising sea vessels in the Bristol Channel.
Sea Shanty book.
Nearing retirement, Whall recalled the sea songs of his youth, combining them perhaps with songs from sailors he had met in the Liverpool and Bristol areas in his latter years. At first he published a selection of songs in the "Nautical Magazine" and in "Yachting Monthly" but then resolved to compile them all in a single book, writing: "I set myself a plain task, namely to write down these songs, music and words, as I heard them sung at sea by sailors." He enrolled the help of his younger brother Roughton Henry Whall (1862–1933), an organist and music teacher (Mus. Bac., FRCO) living in Stroud, Glos as well as his niece Veronica Whall (b1885), the young daughter of another brother Christopher Whall, a stained glass artist in Dorking. Roughton Whall supplied the musical settings and Veronica Whall the illustrations for the book, which came out in 1910 and quickly went through several editions. It contained 50 songs, half of which would find their way into most modern shanty books or repertoires. 
Whall's book preceded the collection of another genuine seafarer Frank Thomas Bullen (1857–1915). Bullen went to sea in 1869 aged 12 and later became a prolific novelist. At the end of his life he set out 42 shanties in his interesting book. Whall also preceded the folksong collector Cecil Sharp, who picked up shanties from Somerset singers Henry Rapsey and Henry Bailey in Bridgwater as well as a massive store of songs from John Short ('Yankee Jack') at Watchet. Sharp's book "English Folk-Chanteys" came out in 1914. Collections of French shanties were made by Captain Armand Hayet in 1927 and American songs by Joanna Carver Colcord in 1924. Many modern scholars, however, still reference Capt Whall's book in their investigations into sea songs and shanties. Richard Runciman Terry in his book "The Shanty Book Part One" comments that 'of all these collections (of shanties) Capt. Whall's is the only one which a sailor could accept as authoritative'.
Books on seamanship.
Whall used his maritime experience to produce several books on seamanship, notably "Practical Seamanship for use in the Merchant Service" and "Handy Book of the Stars used in Navigation". Whall also commented on the various nautical references in William Shakespeare's writings.
Personal life.
Whall's wife Jane was from Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada and they had two children. Whall died in 1917.

Tomb C.14

The Theban Tomb C.14 is an ancient Egyptian tomb in Thebes, Upper Egypt. It is located in Sheikh Abd el-Qurna, part of the Theban Necropolis on the west bank of the Nile opposite Luxor. The tomb likely dates to the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt.
It was previously thought to be the burial place of Ankhefendjehuty, also called Neferibre-seneb. Recent work shows that Ankhefendjehuty likely usurped the tomb of Karakhamun (TT223). The tomb designated as C.14 by Wilkinson is in fact an unfinished, un-inscribed tomb. It was only partially constructed, and only one aisle of the pillared hall was completed.

In June 1976, on the "Pleiades II" expedition on the R/V Melville to the Galápagos Rift, Crane detected a 0.1 °C anomaly using a temperature-monitoring system she had developed for the Deep-Tow seafloor imaging system run by Fred Noel Spiess of the Marine Physical Laboratory at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The temperature anomaly, as well as seafloor images of volcanic features, provided strong support for the hypothesis that hydrothermal vents existed on the seafloor. Crane nick-named the sites “Clambake I" and "Clambake II", after the abundance of clamshells in the area, and deployed transponders near the vents. She published the maps and temperature anomaly in the Journal of Geophysical Research in November 1977, and on the structure and tectonics in the Journal of Geology in November 1978, and in the Journal of Geophysical Research in October 1979.
In February 1977, Crane's map and transponders enabled a team of geochemists and geophysicists, led by chief scientists John (Jack) Corliss, from Oregon State University, Richard (Dick) Von Herzen from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and Robert (Bob) Ballard from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, to return to the Clambake site with the deep-ocean research submersible, DSV Alvin on the R/V Knorr. Close-up photography and biological sampling of Clambake I and II led to the discovery of the biological process of chemosynthesis in clams, mussels, and tube worms, and was key evidence in support of the nascent theory of plate tectonics.
In the 1980s, Crane was involved in mapping hydrothermal vents on the Juan de Fuca Ridge and additional vent fields along the East Pacific Rise. She also published geophysical models of along-axis spacing of sea-floor volcanism.
In 1990, Crane was part of an expedition of American, Soviet and Canadian scientists, sponsored by the National Geographic Society and the Soviet Academy of Sciences, that discovered hydrothermal vents on the bottom of Lake Baikal in southern Siberia, which revealed that the lake lies in a continental rift zone.
Scientific career.
From 1979-2001, Crane was a Research Associate at Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory, where she studied the formation of mid-ocean ridges. In 1985, she was awarded a Fulbright Award at University of Oslo and University of Paris. From 1985 to 2001, she was a professor of oceanography at Hunter College of the City University of New York. From 1993-2001, she managed the Arctic Environmental Security program at the United States Naval Research Laboratory, served as U.S. mission coordinator for the Russian-American Long-term Census of the Arctic program, and authored the Arctic Environmental Atlas. From 2001 to 2015, she was a Program Manager in the Arctic Research Program of the Climate Program Office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
Crane has published 83 peer-reviewed articles and is the author of the 2003 autobiography, Sea Legs: Tales of a Woman Oceanographer, which received acclaim as a personal memoir as well as for its first-hand reports of "ocean science, Cold War science, and women's participation in science".

AntiDayton

AntiDayton is a patriotic movement and advocacy group in Bosnia and Herzegovina that promotes the restoration of the legal 1992 constitution, with the goals of creating a unitary state (citizen's constitution without ethnic divisions and internal borders) governed under one president, promoting Bosnian-Herzegovinian heritage, strong opposition against the Dayton Agreement, and advocating for remembrance of genocide victims from the 1991–1995 Bosnian War and campaigning for truth and justice against war criminals.
History.
AntiDayton started as a grassroots activist organisation among local and diaspora Bosnians (especially Bosniaks), with its base on the worldwide social media platform Facebook. It was organized around the concept that the Dayton Agreement, which ended the Bosnian War and provided the current structure and constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was a total failure and an illegal abrogation of the Constitution of the wartime Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Returning to the previous constitution would have abolished the entities of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brčko District and Republika Srpska, from which the group sees as only promoting internal divisions and ethnic tensions. The group's first public gathering was in the Sarajevo, under the slogan "Let's bury Dayton, under the ground and concrete!"
Activism.
Since 2012, AntiDayton has organized commemorations of historic events (placing the flag of the medieval kingdom of Bosnia in Bobovac), patriotic group field trips (seeing Bosnian Queen Catherine of Bosnia, raising funds for humanitarian causes, visiting the forgotten war patriots, distributing presents for (returning refugees) kids in need, being there during times of natural disasters (2014 Bosnia-Herzegovina floods), fundraising for construction of victim memorials (Nermin Divović - Sarajevo), advocacy for the return of the land grab and case of Sutorina dispute, commemorating genocide burials throughout Bosnia (Flag draping over victims coffins in Srebrenica), advocating solutions through multimedia show appearances (TV A1, Alpha TV, N1 TV, BHTVNY, BosTel, Radio Naša Riječ), standing up for wrongfully charged and innocent Bosnian leaders (e.g. Jovan Divjak, Naser Orić, Atif Dudaković, Dragan Vikić, Jusuf Pušina...), protesting civil injustice (closing of the National Museum, genocide denial, Russia involvement in Bosnian war crimes), and appearing at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia sentencing of Bosnian Serb and Croat war criminals and standing with Bosniak victims in support.
Views.
AntiDayton sees the origins of Bosnian people being defined by having Illyrian ancestors, the Bosnian Church, and Bogomils. It believes that the Bosnian public education could have one unified curriculum only taught in the Bosnian language. AntiDayton also supports the criminalization of genocide denial and the jailing (or even sentencing to death) of war criminals.
Politics.
AntiDayton is not affiliated with any political party, but is supportive of first Bosnian president Alija Izetbegović. AntiDayton supports Bosnia and Herzegovina's accession to the European Union, the abrogation of the Dayton Accords in favor of Bosnia's 1992 constitution, and the complete removal of ethnic quotas.

Saltpeter Cave

Saltpeter Cave, in Carter Caves State Resort Park near Olive Hill, Kentucky. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.
It has also been known as Swingle's Cave and as Swindell's Cave. It is a limestone cave with of measured length.
It has served as a saltpeter, or niter, mine, by the early 1800s. It has been believed, by local tradition, that niter mined from the cave was used to make gunpowder for the War of 1812, including supplying for the 1815 Battle of New Orleans.
The cave entrance is gated by a "limestone block and iron bar structure, resembling a jail cell", which was built in the mid-1900s.
The cave was developed for use by bats.
The cave is unique in that it is a hibernaculum for the endangered Indiana Bat in the winter months.
It is open for cave tours during the summer, from Memorial Day to Labor Day.

<doc id="56994335" url="?curid=56994335" title="Coterie of Social Workers">
Coterie of Social Workers

The Coterie of Social Workers is a women's organization, established in 1921 in Trinidad and Tobago, British West Indies to engage in empowering women as well as providing benevolent assistance to the poor and disadvantaged. It was the first organization to target for membership, middle-class women of colour and focus on the needs of working class women, regardless of their marital status and was the leading women's organization in the country from its establishment through the 1940s. Though it has branches throughout the country, its headquarters is located at 3 Longden Street in Port of Spain.
History.
In 1921, Audrey Jeffers, an educated, middle-class Afro-Trinidiadian teacher recognized that the needs of her students were far greater than education. She founded the Coterie of Social Workers in Port of Spain to help with their health and welfare needs. Prior to forming the organisation, assistance to the disadvantaged was provided solely by upper-class white and coloured women and focused mainly toward assisting women to become better wives. Jeffers believed the focus of assistance should be on working class women and their children, regardless of their marital status, and she recruited like minded women to engage in the work of the Coterie. The organisation was headquartered in Briarsend, at the end of Briar Street in the Saint Clair district, and held fundraising events to raise money for improvement projects. In 1926, they opened a school lunch program in Newtown, which provided free meals and became known as the "Breakfast Shed". Quickly the need for providing nutritious meals spread and other sheds were established. By 1934, there were locations in Barataria, on Edward Street in the center of Port of Spain, in San Fernando, Siparia and on Tobago.
The Coterie continued expanding services to assist the less advantaged and raise the status of middle class women of colour, but focused primarily on black women. One of the few exceptions was Afro- and Indo-Trinidadian, social worker and Coterie member, Gema Ramkeesoon, who campaigned for cooperation among various ethnic groups, as well as against shadism. In addition to providing homes for the blind and elderly, the Coterie pressed for higher education for girls and employment opportunities for middle class women. They sought reform of laws to address illegitimacy and alimony, and pressed to change laws which barred women from participating in governmental boards and councils, or serving as jurors. The Coterie would be the leading women's rights organization for middle-class women in Trinidad and Tobago from the 1920s to the 1940s.
In 1936, the Coterie hosted a conference in Port of Spain and invited social workers from throughout the British West Indies and British Guiana. Marking the 15th anniversary of the Coterie, the conference held from 30 April to 10 May, aimed to promote regional cooperation between women involved in social welfare projects to improve educational, social and political spheres for women. The same year that this conference occurred, the government was taking steps to limit women's roles, passing legislation in Trinidad to ban married women as teachers. A few years later, they barred women from working at night, in an attempt to curtail them from being away from their primary duty of caring for their children. At the conference, women such as Jeffers, Beatrice Greig, Jessie Masson, and Gertie Wood spoke about women's intellectual capacity, their subordination and suppression, and the need for women to become educated and press for their right to be included in social and political structures. The conference was notable in that it did not allow men to speak throughout the majority of the sessions and that Jeffers emphasized that the government was failing in its obligation to address the needs of citizens.
At the conclusion of the conference the public opinion was mixed, with some sectors understanding the problem of unequal policies for men and women, while others blamed women for their lack of action to improve their situation. The conference, however, marked a turning point. Following the conference, Jeffers ran for a seat on the Port of Spain City Council and won the first seat ever awarded to a woman in the country. The following year in Jamaica, Amy Bailey and Mary Morris Knibb formed the Women's Liberal Club, along the lines of the Coterie, which focused on improving socio-economic and political status for middle class women of colour. In 1938, the Coterie submitted a response to the West India Royal Commission enquiry calling for reform of education systems which did not allow girls to compete for Island Scholarships, did not provide vocational training, had no adult education programs to train women, and did not provide nursery schools, among other issues. They also pointed out the need for measures to prevent employment discrimination on the basis of color and gender, to facilitate forming of trade unions to protect women and girls, the need for women police officers to deal with women offenders and reform of child support laws.
In 1940, the Coterie opened its first day nursery, called "Cipriani House", in Laventille and In the 1940s and 1950s, working with the Child Welfare League, the Day Nursery Association, the League of Women Voters and the Union of Women Citizens, the Coterie instigated the establishment of National Health Centers. Attending government meetings, Parliament sessions and lectures from health professionals, the women pressed to have health services available throughout Trinidad and Tobago.
Present.
The organisational headquarters is now located at 3 Longden Street in Port of Spain and celebrated its 85th year of operation in 2007 at which time, complaints surfaced that the house at 22 Sweet Briar Road, the original site of the Coterie, was in disrepair. It was restored and is now a Cultural Heritage Site. The organization continues to provide food through its meal centers, located throughout the island.

All Systems Red

All Systems Red is a 2017 science fiction novella by American author Martha Wells. The first in a series called "The Murderbot Diaries", it was published by Tor.com. The series is about an artificial construct designed as a Security Unit, which manages to override its governor unit, thus enabling it to develop independence. It calls itself Murderbot, and likes to watch unrealistic soap operas. As it spends more time with some caring humans, it starts developing feelings that it does not care for.
Synopsis.
A scientific expedition on an alien planet goes awry when one of its members is attacked by a giant native creature. She is saved by the expedition's SecUnit (Security Unit), a cyborg security agent which has secretly named itself "Murderbot". Though it has hacked the governor module that allows it to be controlled by humans, and would much rather be watching soap operas, the SecUnit has a vested interest in keeping its human clients safe and alive, since it has an especially grisly past expedition on its record. Murderbot soon discovers that information regarding hazardous fauna has been deleted from their survey packet of the planet. Further investigation reveals that some sections of their maps are missing as well. Meanwhile the PreservationAux survey team, led by Dr. Mensah, navigate their mixed feelings about the part machine, part human nature of their SecUnit. When they lose contact with the other known expedition, the DeltFall Group, Mensah leads a team to the opposite side of the planet to investigate. At the DeltFall habitat, Murderbot discovers that everyone there has been brutally murdered, and one of their three SecUnits destroyed. Murderbot disables the remaining two as they attack it, but is surprised when two others appear; it destroys one, and Mensah takes the other.
Murderbot is seriously injured, and realizes that one of the rogue SecUnits has installed a combat override module into its neck. The Preservation scientists are able to remove it before it completes the data upload that would put Murderbot under the control of whoever has command over the other SecUnits. The team discovers that Murderbot is autonomous, and once malfunctioned and murdered 57 people. The Preservation scientists mostly agree that, based on its protective behavior thus far, the SecUnit can be trusted. Remembering small incidents that now appear to be attempted sabotage, Murderbot and the group determine that there must be a third expedition, whose members are trying to eliminate DeltFall and Preservation for some reason. The Preservation scientists confirm that their HubSystem has been hacked, and flee their habitat before the mystery expedition they have dubbed "EvilSurvey" comes to kill them. The EvilSurvey team—GrayCris—leaves a message in the Preservation habitat inviting its scientists to meet at a rendezvous point to negotiate terms for their survival. Murderbot knows that GrayCris will never let them live, but the SecUnit has a plan. It makes an overture to GrayCris to negotiate for its own freedom, but this is a distraction while the Preservation scientists access the GrayCris HubSystem to activate their emergency beacon. The plan works, but Murderbot is injured protecting Mensah from the explosion of the launch. Later the SecUnit finds itself repaired, and retaining its memories and disabled governor module. Mensah has bought its contract, and will bring it back to Preservation's home base where it can live autonomously. Though grateful, Murderbot is reluctant to have its decisions made for it, and slips away on a cargo ship.
Reception.
"Publishers Weekly" wrote that Wells "gives depth to a rousing but basically familiar action plot by turning it into the vehicle by which SecUnit engages with its own rigorously denied humanity". "The Verge" likewise felt it to be a "pretty basic story", but nonetheless "fun", and lauded Wells's worldbuilding. James Nicoll observed that the plot relies on "opportunistic corporate malevolence", and noted that only Murderbot's personality prevented the setting from being "unrelentingly grim".
"All Systems Red" won the 2017 Nebula Award for Best Novella, the 2018 Hugo Award for Best Novella, and the American Library Association's Alex Award, and was nominated for the 2017 Philip K. Dick Award.

Aculus laevis

Aculus laevis is a species of mite which causes galls on the leaves of sallows ("Salix" species). It was first described by Alfred Nalepa in 1892.
Description of the gall.
The gall is a 1–2 mm pouch on the upper side of the leaves of sallows and their hybrids. At first they are yellowish-green and turn to a reddish-brown later. On the underside of the leaf is an elliptical opening which has protruding hairs and contains a single mite. There can be up to thirty galls on a leaf. The gall has been found on eared willow ("S. aurita"), goat willow ("S. caprea"), grey willow ("S. cinerea") and their hybrids.
The similar galls on the longer leaf willows such as crack willow ("S. fragilis"), are caused by "A. tetanothrix". Redfern et al (2011) state that the identification of all mite galls on "Salix" species is tentative and there are probably unnamed species yet to be described. In addition the mites should be verified by an expert.
Distribution.
"Aculus laevis" has been recorded from Austria, Croatia, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales), Hungary, Ireland and Slovenia.

Maria Morris Miller

Maria Morris Miller (1813–1875) was a Canadian artist from Halifax, Nova Scotia who is known for her botanical paintings and illustrations. She presented her work to Queen Victoria and received royal patronage for life. She is also the first professional woman artist in Nova Scotia, recognized in her field during her active career years. She worked with scientists and government officials, garnering her accolades as the "Audubon of Nova Scotian field flowers".
Career.
Born into a middle class family, Miller's mother Sybilla encouraged her to learn about art. Miller studied her craft in Halifax under the tutelage of a visiting British painter named L'Estrange. She also studied with W.H. Jones, a Bostonian who taught at Dalhousie College. In 1830, she began offering drawing classes to female students which gave her some financial independence. The North British Society of Halifax honoured her with the title of "Painter of the Year" in 1836.
Soon after, Nova Scotia's Secretary of Agriculture and botanist, Titus Smith, asked Miller to paint a series of canvasses depicting local wildflowers. He brought her specimens which she quickly had to immortalize, before the plants deteriorated. During the mid 1830s, aided by Smith's scientific input, Miller produced a large number of water colour drawings which later ended up in an important Halifax art exhibition in 1848.
Smith provided botanical descriptions for Miller's first catalog of coloured lithographs entitled "Wild Flowers of Nova Scotia". It was issued in 1840 by a London bookseller and local publisher, with the financial support of the province's lieutenant-governor Sir Colin Campbell. Two other sets of lithographs followed in 1853 and 1866. The second publication was also issued as "Wild Flowers of Nova Scotia". The third catalog was entitled "Wild Flowers of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick" and was annotated by George Lawson, a botanist who founded the Botanical Society of Canada. In 1867, the first series was reissued with a new title, "Wild Flowers of British North America". With her four catalogs, Miller was able to document 22 native plants, at a time when there was an increasing interest in natural history.
In 1862, Miller participated in an International Exhibition in London, England. Although her drawings arrived too late to be part of the competition, she received positive reviews in the English press. In 1867, a copy of her botanical paintings were exhibited at the Paris Exposition.
Miller's works are part of the permanent collection at the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Atlantic Canada's largest art museum. Other paintings and lithographs are owned by The Nova Scotia Museum of Natural History, also located in Halifax. Ottawa's National Gallery of Canada has some of her lithographs as well, belonging to the 1840 and 1853 series.
Also a writer, Miller published a volume of poetry, "Metrical Musings", with her sister Catherine in 1856.
Personal life.
Most records indicate that Maria Morris Miller was born in 1813 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the daughter of Captain Guy Morris and Sibylla Amelia Maria Sophia Leggett. Her father, who was a descendant of Charles Morris, died when Maria was a small child. (She may have also been born in 1810 in Country Harbour, Nova Scotia with her mother moving the family to Halifax after her father's death in 1813.) In 1840, Maria Morris Miller married Garret Trafalgar Nelson Miller, the son of Garrett Miller and Catherine Pernette, who was the daughter of Joseph Pernette. Maria Morris Miller and her husband had five children. She passed away in Halifax in 1875.

Mary Obering

Mary Obering (born 1937) is an American painter focusing mainly on geometric abstraction.
Early life and education.
Obering was born in Shreveport, Louisiana in 1937. When Obering was a teenager, she visited Italy for the first time - the formative trip introduced her to art and Renaissance painting, an experience that Obering says "was always in the back of [her] mind."
Obering received her BA in psychology from Hollins University in Roanoke, Virginia in 1959. Later that year, she attended graduate school for psychology at Radcliffe College, studying under noted behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner, who taught at Harvard University at the time.
Obering then moved to New York City to work for CBS, where she studied at the Art Students League. In the mid 1960s she moved again, this time to Denver with her husband and young daughter and received an MFA from the University of Denver in 1971.
Style and technique.
Obering began in sculpture, but soon moved into painting. Her first paintings were Color Field paintings, inspired by Mark Rothko. Obering continued to work in abstraction, while incorporating techniques, such as gilded wood panels, that are reminiscent of early Italian art"." Critics have also described her work as looking like "an exotic form of sculpture."
Exhibitions.
In September 2018, Mary Obering had a solo exhibition in Los Angeles at Kayne Griffin Corcoran where she exhibited acrylic on canvas paintings from the 1970s. Obering is represented by both Kayne Griffin Corcoran in Los Angeles and Bortolami in New York.

Oliver Le Neve

Oliver Le Neve (1662 - November 1711) was a Norfolk country squire and landowning sportsman who lived most of his life at Witchingham Hall in Great Witchingham, Norfolk, England, and is significant for his 1698 mortal duel with Sir Henry Hobart of Blickling Hall, the last recorded duel fought in Norfolk.
Early life.
Oliver Le Neve was born in 1662 to Francis Le Neve (d.1681), a London draper and upholsterer at Cornhill, and Avice, his wife, who was daughter to city merchant Peter Wright. Francis Le Neve, who may have been brought to London by his Norfolk kinsman William Le Neve, owned a modest amount of London property, warehouses and shops. Oliver Le Neve had an older brother, Peter, who became an antiquary, elected President of the Antiquarian Society in 1687, and became a Norroy King of Arms herald. Le Neve's immediate family originated in Norfolk, with the ancestral family dating there to at least the early 15th century, particularly at Ringland; his grandfather Firmian Le Neve was the first from Ringland known to live in London.
An older half-cousin twice removed of Le Neve, also called Oliver Le Neve (c.1600 - 1678) of Great Witchingham, who had been a stationer in London, willed in 1674 everything to his 10-year-old namesake, leaving the brother Peter as the recipient of the bequest if Oliver died without male heir. The settlement left Le Neve wealthy and the owner of Witchingham Hall, with his income being augmented by rent from his properties in London. Le Neve was sent to Hart Hall at Oxford in 1679–80, and later in life became a local magistrate and captain of the local militia.
Marriage and Witchingham Hall.
In 1684 Le Neve married Anne Gawdy (1656 - 1696), who was from a further Norfolk gentry family at West Harling, typically of lawyers and MPs. Anne Gawdy was granddaughter to Sir William Gawdy (1612–1669), who was an MP in the Cavalier Parliament, and who had bought his baronetcy in 1663. Anne died in 1696 after producing two boys, one of whom died in 1689 in infancy, and three girls. Le Neve was a strong friend to Bassingbourne, Anne's brother, until his death of smallpox. He renovated and replanted gardens at Witchingham Hall, with plants, particularly fruit, he bought from local contacts, or in London and transported through the port of Great Yarmouth from the Thames. He shipped additional London purchases under personal request of the Gawdy family, particularly painting materials for the painter and brother of Bassingbourne, John Gawdy who succeeded to the Gawdy baronetcy as the 2nd Baronet.
Le Neve became a popular and social focus for young Tory squires, the sons of Civil War cavaliers, with Witchingham Hall becoming a centre for convivial hospitality, and animosity towards the Whigs in power and the court. The pastimes he and his friends favoured were hunting with beagles, shooting, fishing, and horse racing at Newmarket. Through these he became close friends with John (Jack) Millecent, a rakish squire from Linton, Cambridgeshire, whose family also shared mutual animosity with their local Whigs. By 1694 Millecent had persuaded Le Neve to breed and keep his own beagle pack, sold to him by Millecent who later stated was "the finest pack of Beagles in England". The growing reputation of Le Neve's pack in 1697 prompted Sir Horatio Pettus Bt. to beg a hound off him, one of a number sold to members of the Norfolk gentry. In 1707, after hunting hare and fox in Norfolk, Essex and Surrey, Le Neve sold his pack, only to buy another soon after.
Le Neve was a collector of ribald verse penned by his Witchingham Hall circle of friends which he edited and gathered into a folio miscellany, and which today is kept by Chetham's Library in Manchester. Some verses were by Le Neve himself, with titles such as 'Madam as victors when they quit the field', 'Tell me insipid lecher now the tide', and 'When Lydia thou the rosy neck and arms'.
After the death of Le Neve's wife Anne, Millecent promoted a match with Jane Knyvet (b.1670), referred to as one of the "Darsham Ladies" of Suffolk, and the fourth daughter to Sir John Knyvet of Ashwellthorpe; Le Neve married her in 1698.
Election and animosity.
Le Neve was frequently at odds with, and slighted by, Norfolk higher gentry who tended to be Whigs and supporters of William III. A particular earlier slight was the patronizing attitude of Thomas Browne of Elsing Hall over the 22-year-old Le Neve's trade ("mircatorian") family background.
This animosity came to a head during the election year of 1698. Sir Henry Hobart MP of Blickling Hall was "the undisputed leader of Norfolk Whigs", and an influential operator of Whig patronage of government, public office and county favours, part of a perceived corrupt regime that excluded Le Neve and his fellow Tories. The election was, however, a turning point for Hobart, a sitting MP. Three candidates contended for two positions: Sir Henry (Whig), Sir William Cooke (Tory), and Sir Jacob Astley (Whig). Hobart lost after spending a considerable sum to ensure his seat. In the heightened atmosphere surrounding the election, rumours were circulating about Hobart, particularly concerning his growing debts and creditors, and one that Le Neve was saying Hobart was a coward, especially during 1689-90 when he was Gentleman of the Horse for William III while campaigning in Ireland, and it was this poor reputation cost him the election. Le Neve denied the accusation. Hobart, who believed Le Neve was instrumental in his defeat, publicly accused him of spreading the rumour—this in the market square at Reepham in Le Neve's absence—and that the only reason he denied it was that he was too afraid to fight. Le Neve wrote to Hobart asserting again his innocence, but offering to give satisfaction to whomever had spread the rumour, saying if Hobart could not prove the name of the culprit, he would assume it was "Blickling" (code for Hobart himself) that was generating this quarrel, and that he would meet him at his choosing. An appointment was made for the duel.
Duel and aftermath.
Duels had been tacitly assumed illegal since a 1614 edict by James I, but often a blind eye was turned. However, prosecution for duelling was a possibility, especially if no seconds or witnesses were present to assure fair play. Adam Nicolson in his book "Gentry: Six Hundred Years of a Peculiarly English Class" conjectures that despite this, the reason Hobart and Le Neve refused seconds was conversely to avoid any witness for possible prosecution. Some sources suggest that a young servant girl witnessed the duel from nearby bushes; reliable sources either don't mention this, or if they do, treat it as folklore.
The duel took place on Cawston Heath on 20 August 1698. Both men rode from their respective seats: Hobart from Blickling to the north-east, and Le Neve from Witchingham 4 miles to the south-west. During the duel the left-handed Le Neve was apparently struck in the arm and replied with a thrust to the belly. The mortally wounded Hobart returned to Blickling Hall, died the following day and was buried in the Blickling family vault. 
Narcissus Luttrell, parliamentary diarist, heard that Le Neve "was wounded in the arm and Sir Henry run into the belly" The antiquary John Nichols in 1812 stated that Le Neve wasn't struck as Hobart's sword thrust was caught in a greatcoat Le Neve was wearing. Adam Nicolson believes these accounts say more about class attitudes towards the differences in the backgrounds of the two men: the rapier of the elegant swordsmanship of the grand gentry in its finery aiming for the arm and being tangled in the coarse cloth of the minor gentry, which replies with a stab to the belly. However Nicolson is sceptical, believing that as a captain of militia Le Neve would be more than skillful in refined use of sword, and on a possibly hot August day, would prefer not to be encumbered by a greatcoat.
Le Neve decided to escape the area, concerned over repercussions of killing a Whig of such high rank. A £500 reward for capture was offered by Lady Hobart. The armed Norfolk Militia was set to look for him, some searching the Gawdy house at West Harling. From London, Le Neve left for Rotterdam, although occasionally returning incognito to London, where he was once nearly captured. He kept in touch with his family and friends who offered advice to avoid capture and provided Norfolk comestibles, he sending goods back from Holland. While on his travels and in Rotterdam he adopted the aliases of 'Davyes', 'Captain Janszen', and 'Mr Browne, the sword cutler'. He received a visit from his wife Jane in 1699. In East Anglia Le Neve was a hero and martyr for Tories, while the Whigs wanted him outlawed if he didn't return to face trial. His friends tried to arrange a sheriff and jury who would be, to their mind, honest and responsible. He returned and went on trial at Thetford assizes in 1700, was found not guilty, and returned to Witchingham. After Jane died in 1704, and was buried at St Mary's Church, Jack Millecent again turned matchmaker for Le Neve. He secured a further marriage on 31 July 1707 to Elizabeth (b.1678), daughter to his friend Robert Sheffield who was the grandson to the Earl of Mulgrave; she was one of two eligible Sheffield sisters presented by Millecent. Three months later Elizabeth died.
Following the duel, Lady Hobart erected a memorial stone plinth with urn at the site. Today the plinth is a Grade II listed structure.
Death.
Oliver Le Neve died on 23 November 1711 at West Harling, and was buried with his first wife Anne Gawdy at Great Witchingham. As his sons predeceased him, his estate passed to his elder brother Peter until his death in 1729, who in his will intended the estate to pass to his three nieces, Le Neve's daughters. However, after legal battles, with accusations by the Le Neves of conflict interest, the estate was taken through reversion of the will by the trustees of a John Norris, whose grandfather, a Norwich lawyer of the same name, had acted as trustee for the young Oliver Le Neve. The three daughters of Le Neve were ejected from the estate. These three surviving daughters by Anne Gawdy—Isabella, Anne and Henrietta—inherited the Gawdy estate at West Harling, and erected a chancel marble wall monument to their parents in St Mary's Church at Great Witchingham. The monument inscription reads:
Under the earth near this stone lyeth the dust of Oliver le Neve Esq late of this parish one of the Justices of the Peace and Captain of a Foot Company of the Militia of this County Second son of Frances le Neve gentleman Citizen and Draper of London and of Avice his wife daughter of Peter Wright and sister and heir of Peter Wright of London Merchant he died on the 23rd day of November Anno Domino 1711 and was buried on the 26th of the same month leaving behind him by his first wife Anne only ye daughter of Sir John Gaudy of West Herling in this County Baronet (who lyeth by his side) three daughters and co-heirs Isabella Anne and Henrietta Le Neve who caused this Memorial to be set up As also what remains of Elizabeth his second wife daughter and co-heir expectant of Robert Sheffield of Kensington in Middlesex Esq grandson of Edmund Earl of Mulgrave long since deceased she died suddenly on the 8th day of November 1707 without child and was buried here on the 12th day of the same month.Tam Math quam Mercurio ["As much a man of war as commerce"]

Lewis Lee Hawkins

Lt. Colonel Lewis Lee Hawkins (8 August 1930 – 2 June 1973) was a United States military aid to Iran who was assassinated. Vahid Afrakhteh, a founding member of Peykar, was captured and confessed to the assassination.
Early life.
Hawkins was born to Herman and Mary Hawkins in Chicago on 8 August 1930. He graduated from Plymouth High School and enlisted in South Carolina Presbyterian college on a basketball scholarship. He graduated in 1952 and joined the United States Army as a second Lieutenant. Hawkins later obtained a master's degree in Business Administration from Syracuse University.
In the 1970s Hawkins became the Director of the Department of Finance at U.S. Army Finance School at Indiana. In 1972 Hawkins was assigned to be in U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group to the Imperial Iranian Armed Forces in Iran. He lived with his wife and children in the Abbasabad district.
Assassination.
On June 2, 1973 Hawkins was walking to the street corner to be picked up by his driver when two terrorists riding on a motorcycle shot him at point blank range, killing him instantly. Hawkins' wife rushed outside to see his body in a pool of blood. The terrorists immediately fled the scene and were not captured.
According to an American military advisor, Hawkins was killed "by an Iranian terrorist". The assassination seemed to have been motivated by political considerations. Although there were two witnesses, assassins were wearing motorcycle helmets and could not be identified. Some GOI officials believed the group responsible to be left-wing and Iraq-supported, while others suspected Mujahedin-e-Khalq.
On May 11, 1976, the Washington Post reported that in January of that year, "nine terrorists convicted of murdering the three American colonels… were executed. The leader of the group, Vahid Afrakhteh, one of the founders of Peykar (Marxist group that broke off from Mujahedin-e-Khalq) stated that he personally killed col. Lewis Lee Hawkins in Tehran in 1973. The Country Reports issued a statement saying "A Marxist element of the MEK murdered several of the Shah's U.S. security advisers prior to the Islamic Revolution." Despite this, some sources have attributed these assassinations to the Mujahedin-e-Khalq.

Bosh v. Cherokee County Governmental Building Authority

Bosh v. Cherokee County Governmental Building Authority is a 2013 Supreme Court of Oklahoma case that held for the first time that the Oklahoma state constitution provided a civil remedy for violations of state constitutional rights. The recognition of civil remedies directly under the state constitution was viewed as a watershed moment in the development of civil rights in Oklahoma. Since the decision issued, claims asserting violations of state constitutional rights in Oklahoma are now colloquially referred to as "Bosh claims."
The Bosh decision resulted from an incident at a local jail. Video from the facility showed a handcuffed man, later identified as Daniel Bosh, exchanging words with a jailer. The video shows the jailer leave his chair to confront Mr. Bosh. As the two men continued exchanging words, the jailer grabbed Mr. Bosh by the back of the neck and drove his head into the front of the booking desk. The jailer then placed Mr. Bosh's head underneath his arm and fell backwards causing Mr. Bosh's head to strike the floor causing injuries.
At the time of the incident, Oklahoma law provided absolute immunity for conduct occurring within a jail facility. In Bosh, the Oklahoma Supreme Court recognized that immunity conflicted with the state constitution which prohibited the use of excessive force. For this reason, the Oklahoma Supreme Court held that recognizing immunity in this circumstance would nullify rights granted by the state constitution.
Since the decision issued, both state and federal courts have wrestled with the scope of the opinion and how it might apply in contexts outside excessive force within a jail.
The case was argued to the Court by lawyers from the Bryan &amp; Terrill law firm.

Lateral cervical nucleus

The lateral cervical nucleus is a scattered nucleus located dorsally in the lateral funiculus in the first three cervical segments of the spine. The spinocervical and spinothalamic tracts synapse in the lateral cervical nucleus; the spinocervical tract projects ipsilaterally while the spinothalamic tract projects contralaterally. The axons of neurons from the lateral cervical nucleus cross the midline, join the medial lemniscus as it forms in the caudal medulla and ascend to the ventral posterolateral nucleus.

Threadfin anthias

Nemanthias is a genus of marine ray-finned fish in the subfamily Anthiinae of the family Serranidae, the groupers and sea basses. It is a monotypic genus containing the single species Nemanthias carberryi, the threadfin anthias, which is native to the western Indian Ocean. It is found at depths of 10–30 meters on coral reefs.
Description.
"Nemanthias carberryi" grows to a maximum total length of around . The dorsal fin has 11 spines and 16 to 17 soft rays, while the anal fin has three spines and seven soft rays. The first two dorsal spines are long and flexible. The upper lip is thickened and has a nipple-like papilla in the centre. Juvenile fish have an extra small dorsal spine at first. The cornea of the eye exhibits a marked iridescence which changes from greeish-blue to orange, depending on the angle of view; electron microscopy shows that this is due to the angled lamellae on the surface.

José María Bravo

José María Bravo Fernández-Hermosa (8 April 1917 – 26 December 2009) was a Spanish Republican fighter pilot and flying ace. During the Spanish Civil War, he fought for the Second Republic and later for the Soviet Union in the Second World War. Until his death in 2009, he was the highest-scoring Spanish fighter pilot still alive.
Early life.
José María Bravo was born Madrid in 1917 and studied at the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, where he was considered a good student. His good grades won him a place at a study-abroad program in Germany.
Spanish Civil War.
Upon the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936, Bravo volunteered to serve in the Spanish Republican Air Force. He had already flown gliders. Bravo was accepted and traveled to the Soviet Union as part of the first course of pilots. After six months of training in Kirovabad, he returned to Spain in June 1937 as a non-commissioned fighter pilot and an expert in the state-of-the-art Polikarpov I-16 monoplanes. He flew with Russian pilots in the 1ª Escuadrilla de Moscas. His command abilities and charisma earned him multiple promotions: Teniente (11 March 1938) and Capitán (31 May 1938).
He was put in command of the 3ª Escuadrilla de Moscas and participated in the battles of the Levante and Ebro. This squadron achieved the most aerial victories during the Levante Campaign, with 10 credited to Bravo. On 27 August 1938, he became the adjutant of Grupo 21 de Caza (under the command of Manuel Zarauza Clavero and composed of I-16 fighters) at only 22 years old. The Republican defeat at the Ebro made imminent Republican defeat inevitable and the Catalonia Offensive forced the remaining Republican pilots to flee to France, Bravo among them. He was credited with 23 individual aerial victories achieved during 160 aerial combats and 1200 flying hours. He flew the I-16s marked "CM-193" y "CM-249".
Second World War.
He was imprisoned in the refugee camps at Gurs and Argelès-sur-Mer in southern France until fleeing to the Soviet Union, where he resumed his studies at Járkov (Ukraine), until the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. He tried to join the Red Air Force but the Soviet commanders declined to take Spanish pilots, so he had to join a unit of miners and nighttime saboteurs operating in the Azov area. In 1942, he was accepted into the VVS along with several other former Republican pilots and participated in the defense of the Baku area during the Battle of the Caucuses. In 1943, he led the aerial escort for Stalin in his trip to Tehran for the Teheran Conference. In 1948, he was demobilized.
Return to Spain.
After leaving the VVS he went to Moscow, where he worked at the Instituto Pedagógico de Idiomas teaching Spanish. In 1960, he returned to Spain without too much trouble from the Franquist authorities due to his past as a Spanish Republican combatant and his residence in the Soviet Union. From 1976, he helped found the Asociación De Aviadores de la República ("ADAR") to obtain recognition for the military service of Spanish Republican aviators. This having been achieved, in 1978, he was named a colonel in the Ejército del Aire, with all associated privileges. Since then he collaborated with the Fundación Infante de Orleans, especially in its project to acquire an I-16. He continued to attend aerial demonstrations until his death in Madrid at the end of 2009.
Movie.
In 2012 a biographical movie, "El Español" (English: "The Spaniard", "Испанец" in the original Russian), directed by Aleksandr Tsatsuev (Александр ЦАЦУЕВ) and starring Vladimir Panchik (Владимир ПАНЧИК) as Bravo, was screened.

Margaret Menzies Campbell

Margaret Williamson Menzies Campbell FDS FRCSE (née Shirlaw; 21 July 1893 – 1990) was a Scottish surgeon and general practitioner, who is known for her work as an historian of women's medical education and practice and dentistry.
Early life and education.
Menzies Campbell was born in Carfin, North Lanarkshire on 21 July 1893 to Agnes and John Shirlaw. Her mother was the older sister of Dr Marion Gilchrist and named her daughter Margaret after their mother, Margaret Gilchrist, née Williamson. On her birth record, her father is listed as the manager of Carfin Farm, however, by the 1911 census, the family had moved to Darlington, County Durham.
She attended University College Dundee and then University of St Andrews School of Medicine, graduating with an MB ChB in 1918.
During her time at St Andrews, in 1915, she founded the Bute Medical Society, with the support of six other students and was the Society's first president.
Career.
A month after her graduation, she was appointed as a house surgeon at Doncaster Royal Infirmary in August 1918. She was the first woman to hold this post at the institution.
One of her cases made the newspapers, showcasing the pressure the medical profession was under at the time, when a young woman, Elizabeth Pawson, died suddenly "whilst under an anaesthetic, during an operation for appendicitis".
Shirlaw had operated alone, except for a nurse - Sister Florence Milnes - who had administered the anaesthetic. During the inquest, Shirlaw explained that this situation was unusual, but was "owing to the shortage of doctors and the influenza epidemic". Shirlaw testified that she had performed "between 200 and 400 operations since her appointment" in August 1918. The Coroner felt that he could not rule on the case entirely by himself, and called for a jury to attend on 18 March 1919. They heard from Dr Reginald Wilson, a member of the honorary medical staff at the Infirmary, that performing the operation alone was "against the rules of the Infirmary in normal times, and against general practice". Dr Cleresby Wilson, another doctor, and also the hospital administrator, restated that the lack of doctors available to help Shirlaw was due to the war during his testimony. The jury ruled that Pawson's death had been due to her poor overall health. They added a rider that no blame should be attached to Shirlaw, nor any of the other hospital staff, but suggested that in future a medical practitioner be called in to administer the anaesthetic.
She continued to work in Doncaster for another two years, when she returned to Glasgow and joined her aunt, Marion Gilchrist, in general practice, based at 5 Buckingham Terrace
She is also listed at this time as working at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow as a surgeon. She researched and wrote histories of women's medical education and practice in Scotland. She founded a Menzies Campbell lecture series, similar to the one started by her husband at the RCSEng Faculty of Dental Surgery at each of the three Scottish dental schools - Glasgow, Dundee and Edinburgh.
Personal life.
She married John Menzies Campbell, a dentist also based in Buckingham Terrace, on the 23 December 1924 at St. George's Presbyterian Church, Darlington.
Campbell was a collector or dental implements and an historian of dentistry. After their marriage, Margaret became his partner in this interest, and maintained it even after his death. She died in 1990.
Awards and honours.
In 1977, she was awarded an honorary Fellowship of the Faculty of Dental Surgery of the Royal College of Surgeons for her work on the history of dentistry. She was the first woman to receive this honour.
She was also made a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.
Selected works.
The following works are available in the archives of University of Dundee, University of Glasgow and the Mitchell Library, Glasgow.

Travis Steele

Travis Andrew Steele (born November 12, 1981) is an American college basketball coach, and current head coach of the Xavier Musketeers men's basketball team.
Coaching career.
Steele began coaching as an undergraduate at Butler University, assisting the varsity boys basketball team at nearby Ben Davis HS from 2001 to 2004. He served one season as a graduate manager at Ohio State before landing his first college coaching position as an assistant coach at Wabash Valley in 2005. Steele moved on to Indiana, where he started as the team's video coordinator in 2006, and was elevated to an assistant coach for the remainder of the 2008 season after Kelvin Sampson's contract was terminated by the Hoosiers as a result of NCAA recruiting violations.
After Indiana, Steele was hired by Sean Miller at Xavier for the 2008-09 season. Steele was retained by Chris Mack after Miller accepted the Arizona head coaching position, and has been a part of a Musketeers program that has been to eight NCAA tournaments, including an Elite Eight run in 2017, as well as being part of two Atlantic 10 regular season titles, and one Big East regular season title.
On March 31, 2018, Steele was promoted to head coach to become the 18th head coach in Xavier history, replacing Mack who departed for Louisville. Travis Steele began his first season (2018 - 2019) with an entirely new coaching staff and a depleted bench, having lost most of Xavier's starters from the previous season to graduation or early declaration for the NBA draft. Xavier would enter the Big East part of their schedule at 8-5 in the non-conference schedule. Despite an early 6-game losing streak in the Big East conference schedule, Steele was able to lead the Musketeers on an end of the regular-season rally, winning 6 of their last 7 regular season conference match-ups. Xavier finished 3rd in the Big East (9-9) heading into the conference tourney. Likely needing a Big East championship to make the NCAA tournament, Xavier was able to win their first Big East tournament match-up against Creighton, before losing to Villanova in overtime in the Big East tournament semi-final. At 18-15, Xavier qualified for the NIT tournament and would fall in the 2nd Round on the road to the eventual NIT tournament champions, Texas, in overtime. Xavier would finish Travis Steele's first season as head coach at 19-16 (9-9).

Paul R. Shaffer

Colonel Paul R. Shaffer (1930–1975) was a United States military aide to Iran who, along with another US officer, Lieutenant Colonel Jack H. Turner, was assassinated by Marxist terrorists. Colonel Shaffer had served as an air force pilot in both Korea and Vietnam. The People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) was responsible for the assassination. In the newspaper clipping, Colonel Shaffer is on the left and Lieutenant Colonel Turner is on the right.
Assassination.
On 21 May 1975, terrorists stopped the car carrying Colonel Shaffer and Lieutenant Colonel Jack Turner. They ordered the Iranian driver to lie down, and then shot and killed the Americans at point-blank range. The shooting happened when the two officers were on their way to work at an Iranian military base in south Tehran.
Aftermath.
The Iranian government identified the terrorists as Marxist guerrillas. An unknown woman, claiming to speak for the "Iranian People’s Warriors Association" said "the execution of American officers was in reply to the execution of nine Iranian revolutionaries in prison the previous month."
Memorial.
In 2005 a memorial was built by the War on Terror Foundation to honor Col. Shaffer.

Lockridge Medical Clinic

Lockridge Medical Clinic was a historic building notable for its Prairie School-style design by Frank Lloyd Wright, located in Whitefish, Montana, United States. Originally built as a medical clinic in 1963, the building served a variety of other commercial purposes before it was demolished by its owners in 2018.
Before its demolition, it was one of three Wright-designed structures in the state of Montana. He had previously designed the Bitter Root Inn in Stevensville, which burned down in 1924, and the Como Orchards Summer Colony complex in Darby, of which only two small cottages survive. When the clinic building was demolished in 2018, it became the first of Wright's intact non-residential buildings to be intentionally destroyed since the Francisco Terrace apartment complex in Chicago was torn down in 1974, and the first of any kind since the W.S. Carr House in Grand Beach, Michigan was demolished in 2004.
History.
Thaddeus Leon Lockridge, a practicing physician in Whitefish, Montana, approached Frank Lloyd Wright to commission him for the design of a new medical clinic building in 1958. Reportedly, Lockridge and his wife chose Wright, by then one of the most famous architects in America, after a Montana architectural firm quoted them a price so "exorbitantly high" that they decided they "may as well have Frank Lloyd Wright design it". Wright drew up plans for the building with his close assistant, John H. "Jack" Howe. The design was among Wright's last works, as he died the following year. Construction began in the summer of 1959, after Wright's death, with the carpenter visiting Taliesin to study Wright's methods. Taliesin Associated Architects (Wright's successor firm) was not involved with the construction process. John T. Whalen, a Whitefish doctor, and Bruce C. McIntyre, who had just closed his blood bank in St. John, Washington to move to Whitefish, joined Lockridge's practice in anticipation of the building's completion, although they protested the Wright design.
At , the clinic was one of the town's largest buildings, and was compared to "half of Montana". Its layout was based around a grid with units of four feet. The design of the building was based on Wright's Usonian houses. Its most noticeable design element, a ceiling-high plastic sphere embedded in the front facade and surrounded by a planter, was removed later after a "vehicular mishap", to provide a more direct entrance to the lobby. The sphere, which was well-lit and resembled a full moon, was used as a terrarium, and later owners of the building attempted to restore it to the facade but could not find any remaining pieces. The building's prominent rooftop gardens remained, but the flowers were removed to make way for HVAC equipment.
The clinic opened for business in 1960. Dr. Lockridge died in 1963, and the other doctors moved out the following year. First State Bank occupied the building from 1964 to 1980, and after that it was divided into three professional offices, which held a variety of tenants including the administrative offices for Iron Horse, an upscale subdivision and golf course in Whitefish. In 2002, the building was purchased again and became the law offices of Sharon and Frank Morrison and Sean and Diana Frampton. The Morrisons, inspired by Wright's Harvey P. Sutton House in their hometown of McCook, Nebraska, decided to restore the building. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.
After the law partnership between the Morrisons and Framptons ended in 2016, the building, locally known as the Frank Lloyd Wright Building, was sold to Mick Ruis, a developer from Columbia Falls, Montana who presented his plans to demolish the building and replace it with a three-story mixed-use development late that year. He was apparently unaware when he submitted the plans that the building was protected and considered historic, but after being made aware of this he nevertheless continued with his plans to raze it, which was originally slated for late 2018. Local residents and members of the Montana Preservation Alliance led a movement to save the building.
On January 3, 2018, the owner began preparing for demolition, leading the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy to reach out with an offer to purchase the building. The conservancy and its allies were willing to pay the full asking price, but sparred with the developers over whether the deposit could be refundable. According to the conservancy, the time frame of one week was not enough for them to raise funds to pay the non-refundable deposit. Ruis had set a January 10 deadline for the negotiations, which ended without a deal on the afternoon of the 10th. Hours later, before preservationists could make any effort to start a second round of negotiations, the building was demolished overnight.
The demolition outraged preservationists and scholars of Wright and modern architecture, both locally and across the country. A billboard appeared in Whitefish two months after the clinic building was razed, calling for residents to boycott Ruis and the development that would replace the building.

Helen Henderson Chain

Helen Henderson Chain (July 31, 1849 – October 10, 1892) was an American artist and mountaineer. The majority of her work focused on landscapes in the American West. She has been called the first resident female artist in Colorado.
Early life.
Helen Henderson was born to George Henry Porter and Sarah Maria (Bacon) Henderson in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1849. The family moved to Antioch, CA when Helen was young. When Helen's mother died in 1862, she moved back to Indianapolis to reside with an aunt. Helen stayed in the Midwest through her formal education, attending Methodist College and graduating from Illinois Female College (present-day MacMurry College) in 1869. She received some formal art training as a part of her education. She married James Albert Chain in 1871, and the couple moved to Colorado.
Life in Colorado.
In Denver, James Chain established a book and stationery store that also sold art supplies. Chain used part of the space as her studio and also taught art students, including famous Rocky Mountain landscape painter Charles Partridge Adams. She continued to study art as well. Among her mentors were Hamilton Hamilton and Hudson River School painter George Inness. Chain was inspired by the outdoors and preferred to do her sketches on location, which often meant climbing mountains, such as Pikes Peak, Grey's Peak, and Long's Peak. She was the first woman to climb the Mount of the Holy Cross, which she did in 1877.
The Chains traveled throughout the West, including trips to Arizona, New Mexico, and California and famous landmarks like the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and Yellowstone. Chain is reported to be the first woman to have painted the Grand Canyon. On these trips they were accompanied by famous artists such as Thomas Moran and William Henry Jackson. Chain was the first woman to exhibit at New York's National Academy of Design, where two of her paintings of New Mexico Pueblos were shown in 1882. Margaret Tobin Brown owned one of her works, which can be seen at the Molly Brown House Museum today.
Chain was also noted for being a humanitarian. After anti-Chinese riots in Denver in 1880, she began to use the storefront of the Chains' bookstore to teach English to Chinese immigrants.
Death.
The Chains embarked on a global tour in March 1892. While in Japan, Chain sent home art in Japanese style back to the Denver Fortnightly Club. On October 10, 1892, they were crossing the South China Sea between Shanghai and Hong Kong when their steamship sank during a typhoon. The Chains both drowned, along with the other passengers on board their ship, "Bokhara".

And Then There Were (N-One)

"And Then There Were (N-One)" is a 2017 science fiction/murder mystery novella by Sarah Pinsker. It was first published in "Uncanny Magazine".
Synopsis.
When physicist Sarah Pinsker is murdered at SarahCon — an interdimensional convention where everyone is Sarah Pinsker from a different alternate timeline — only insurance investigator Sarah Pinsker can solve the case.
Reception.
"And Then There Were (N-One)" was a finalist for the Nebula Award for Best Novella of 2017 and the 2018 Hugo Award for Best Novella.
Tor.com found it "gloriously high-concept", with "a sense of the minute as potentially revelatory", while "Kirkus Reviews" described it as "phenomenal". "Tangent Online", however, considered it "a fairly straightforward murder mystery", and "rather self-absorbed, for obvious reasons".

Richard Steele (minister)

Richard Steele (or Steel) (10 May 1629 – 16 November 1692) was a nonconformist theologian.
Early life.
Richard Steele was born as son of Robert Steele, farmer, at Barthomley, Cheshire, on 10 May 1629. He was educated at Northwich grammar school, admitted sizar at St. John's College, Cambridge, on 1 April 1642, and incorporated M.A. at Oxford on 5 July 1656.
Career.
He succeeded Thomas Porter as rector of Hanmer, Flintshire, probably in 1650. Henry Newcome visited him there on 10 June 1654. He was a member of the fourth Shropshire classis (constituted by parliament in April 1647), and, as such, was one of the ordainers of Philip Henry on 16 September 1657. Thirty years later (9 May 1687) he was one of the ordainers, at his own house in London, of Philip Henry's son, Matthew Henry. In September 1660 he was presented at Flint assizes for not reading the common prayer; the prosecution fell through, owing to Charles II's declaration in October. He was again presented at the spring assizes on 28 March 1661 at Hawarden. He resigned his living in consequence of the Uniformity Act of 1662, preaching a farewell sermon (17 August), in which he said he was ejected for not subscribing his assent to the new prayer-book, which he had not yet seen. He continued to communicate at Hanmer, where he received ‘sitting’ on 19 April 1663. On 25 July he was presented for baptising his own children, and in October was arrested on suspicion of treason. Early in 1665 he was made collector for Hanmer of the ‘royal aid,’ the point being to treat him as a layman. In April 1665 he was again arrested, as he was setting out for London; his pocket diary was taken from him, and passages were misconstrued. An entry of an appointment ‘on a carnal account’ was ‘interpreted to be some woman design.’ Philip Henry records ‘a great noise in the country concerning Mr. Steel's almanack.’
The Five Miles Act, coming into force on 25 March 1666, compelled him to leave Hanmer, and he took up his residence in London. William Urwick the younger conjectures that his was the license granted on 10 June 1672 for presbyterian preaching in ‘the house of Rob. Steele’ at Barthomley, Cheshire; he certainly contributed to the building of a school at Barthomley in 1675. Though he may have made occasional visits to the north, Philip Henry's diary shows that he was constantly exercising his ministry in London from 1671. He gathered a morning congregation at Armourers' Hall, Coleman Street; in the afternoon he preached at Hoxton. He died on 16 November 1692. George Hamond, his colleague and successor, preached his funeral sermon. He had ten sons, five of whom were dead in 1672. His portrait is in Dr. Williams's Library; an engraving from it by Hopwood is given in Wilson.
Bibliography.
Steele published:
Steele also wrote four sermons in the "Morning Exercises," 1660–90, and a biographical preface to the posthumous sermons (1678) of Thomas Froysell (1622–1672).

Orlando Stevens

Orlando Stevens (October 12, 1797 - March 25, 1879) was an attorney and politician whose career included work in Vermont and Minnesota. He is most notable for having served as a member of the Vermont House of Representatives, Vermont Senate, and Minnesota House of Representatives.
Biography.
Orlando Stevens was born in Rutland, Vermont on October 12, 1797, the son of David Stevens and Polly (Crafts) Stevens. Orlando Stevens was raised in St. Albans, and was educated at the Franklin County Grammar School and Castleton Seminary.

In 1822, Stevens married Parma Fisk (1805-1854), the daughter of James Fisk. At the time, Fisk was the U.S. Collector of Customs in Swanton, and he appointed Stevens as his deputy. Stevens later moved to East Highgate, where he continued to practice law while becoming involved in the lumber business, followed by relocation to St. Albans, where he established a successful law practice. A Whig, Stevens served as state's attorney of Franklin County from 1839 to 1842. From 1845 to 1846 he served in the Vermont House of Representatives. From 1852 to 1853, Stevens served in the Vermont Senate, and was chosen to serve as the Senate's President pro tempore.
After serving in the Vermont Senate, Stevens relocated to Winona, Minnesota, where he continued to practice law. By now a Republican, from 1859 to 1860, Stevens was a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives. He later suffered a stroke which left him partly paralyzed, and he decided to return to St. Albans, where he lived in retirement.
Death and burial.
Stevens died in St. Albans on March 25, 1879, and was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in St. Albans.
Family.
The children of Orlando Stevens and Parma Fisk included daughter Parma, who was the wife of David Olmsted, the first mayor of Saint Paul, Minnesota.

Boulders and Bombs

Boulders and Bombs is an Atari 8-bit family video game published on cartridge by CBS Software in 1983. It was written by written by Keith Dreyer and Torre Meeder who previously developed the "Berzerk"-clone "K-Razy Shoot-Out". In "Boulders and Bombs", the player must dig tunnels so three people can cross from one side of the screen to the other. Bird-like creatures, flying in the upper portion of the screen, launch projectiles into the dirt to thwart the player. While there isn't a separate multiplayer mode, joysticks plugged into each of the remaining 1-3 ports ports can each control one of the birds. The game generally received poor reviews.
Gameplay.
Presented in a side-view, roughly a third of the vertical screen is dirt and above that, sky. The dirt extends downward through the non-playable area where the score and other information are displayed.
The player controls both an auger—which digs tunnels when moved through dirt—and a spelunker who can only move through cleared tunnels. The joystick button switches between control of the auger and spelunker. Boulders slow the auger's drilling. The goal is to clear a path so the spelunker, who starts on the left side of the screen, can exit the right side, then repeat the process for two more spelunkers. All three must be freed over the course of one animated day/night cycle.
The sky is occupied by large and small birds, called "alien bird creatures" and "alien probe birds" in the manual. The large birds drop rods which block tunnels. The small birds inject a fungus into the ground which spreads and is deadly to spelunkers. Both obstacles can be cleared with the auger.
When controlling the spelunker, moving the joystick in a circle drops a bomb which removes dirt and fungus. The probe birds can be killed if an exploding bomb hits the fungus injector before the injection process is complete.
Multiplayer.
From 1 to 3 other players (depending on the number of joystick ports) can control probe birds, affecting the primary player's game. This can be done at any time without enabling a specific gameplay mode.
Reception.
In a 2 out of 4 joystick review for "Electronic Fun with Computers &amp; Games", Paul Backer complained of the difficulty in planting bombs with a circular joystick motion, and also pointed out that a secondary player can easily finish off a spelunker by planting fungus directly in front of it. He concluded, "This is a sound premise upon which to build a game. Unfortunately, the designers failed to provide an exciting challenge."
"The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984" gave the game a "D" rating: "The game just isn't exciting and can become frustrating, and I think most players will lose interest quickly." In a 1989 retrospective of Atari 8-bit computer software in "ANALOG Computing", Arthur Leyenberger wrote, ""Boulders and Bombs" was another CBS disappointment. It was difficult to play, uninteresting, and not challenging."

Dietrich und Wenezlan

Dietrich und Wenezlan (Dietrich and Wenezlan) is a fragmentary Middle High German poem about the legendary hero Dietrich von Bern, the counterpart of the historical Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great in Germanic heroic legend. It usually considered part of the so-called "historical" Dietrich material, as it appears to cite Dietrich's exile at the court of Etzel described in the "historical poems" "Dietrichs Flucht" and the "Rabenschlacht". The fragment of about 500 lines tells of Dietrich's challenge by Wenezlan of Poland, who has captured one of Dietrich's warriors. It is unclear whether the fragment was the main focus of a poem or a single episode from a longer poem.
Summary.
Dietrich und Wenezlan has only survived in a single, incomplete and fragmentary version of about 499 rhyming couplets. Dietrich is at the court of Etzel, when Wolfhart, who, along with Hildebrand, has been captured by Wenezlan, arrives to tell him that Wenezlan wants to engage Dietrich in single combat – if Dietrich wins, then Wenezlan will release Wolfhart and Hildebrand. Initially, Dietrich seems reluctant, but when Wolfhart grows angry and accuses Dietrich of cowardice, saying that if Dietrich refuses Wenezlan will attack Etzel with an army, Dietrich says he had been joking and of course would fight to free his vassals. There is then a lacuna. The combat between Dietrich and Wenezlan begins in between their two armies and in the company of courtly ladies. When they have dehorsed each other, they fight on foot all day. The fragment ends before a conclusion is reached.
Manuscript transmission and dating.
Dietrich und Wenezlan is transmitted in a single manuscript fragment of two leaves:
The text itself may have been written around the same time as the manuscript. Alternatively it may have been written earlier. Due to stylistic influence from Wolfram von Eschenbach (died c. 1220), it cannot have been written earlier than 1220. It appears to predate the other historical poems in the Dietrich cycle by at least a decade. 
Genre.
"Dietrich und Wenezlan" is one of the few Dietrich poems written in rhyming couplets. The poem only loosely fits into the category of "historical Dietrich poems," although it clearly takes place within the exile situation described in "Dietrichs Flucht" and the "Rabenschlacht". Victor Millet challenges this classification as uncertain on the grounds that the poem is too fragmentary. The challenge to single combat is more reminiscent of the fantastical poems. Dietrich's initial refusal to fight and the accusation of cowardice ("zagheit") also has more in common with the fantastical poems, where this is a frequent occurrence. His admission that he was merely playing a joke may be a game played by the author. Wenezlan challenges Dietrich to combat by the honor of all women, another aspect more reminiscent of the fantastical poems and courtly romance. Elisabeth Lienert thus describes "Dietrich und Wenezlan" as between the two groups of Dietrich poems: at the same time the poem offers an alternative to the sort of fighting found in poems such as "Dietrichs Flucht" in that it is fairly and chivalrous.
Relation to the oral tradition.
Wenezlan "von Bôlân" (Poland) is possibly inspired by Wenceslaus I of Bohemia. However, Wenezlan is king of Poland and his warriors are actually "Riuzen" (Russians), something that weakens the connection to Wenceslaus. The name Wenezlan is also similar to "Witzlân" of Bohemia, an enemy of Etzel's in Biterolf und Dietleib. Gerhard Eis argued that the source for the poem is a Low German oral tale about Dietrich's battles against the Slavs, basing his theory on the presence of such battles in the "Thidrekssaga", some of which show parallels to Wolfhard's captivity, and the mentioning of battles against Russians and "Wilzen" in a poem by Der Marner. Although Joachim Heinzle finds this suggestion unlikely, Victor Millet finds it plausible.

Louis Heinrici

Louis Heinrici (1847 - c.1930) was a German industrialist and manufacturer.
Personal life.
Louis Heinrici was born on 30 July 1847 in Torgau and died c.1930 in Zwickau. He married Marie Elisabeth (Born Deustler) with whom he had three sons: Joseph Hans Louis Heinrici, Ernst Hermann Heinrici and Rudolf Heinrici.
Business.
In 1876, Louis Heinrici began to manufacture hot air engines, and other small engines, initially in rented rooms. His first factory building was built in 1884 in Zwickau (Saxony). The factory started with two workers, a lathe and a forge. The official company name was: Louis Heinrici, mechanical workshops for precision work, Zwickau in Saxony. The hot-air engines produced by Heinrici, as a mass-produced product, were widely used in the commercial and private sectors because they served as inexpensive and reliable sources of power.
In 1914, the factory had areas for metalworking, plumbing, a paint shop, another building for the turning shop and a laboratory and trial room for test runs, as well as an office building for sales offices and warehouses. In the park-like landscaped gardens were ponds 4 metres in diameter. These were provided with decorative fountains, which were powered by Heinrici engines.
In his 1914 catalogue, Heinrici stated: "Today after 38 years of activity, I still make the same article on a large scale, which I - thanks to thorough study of all relevant issues of a scientific and technical nature for the construction of such machines, as well as tireless forward striving for attainable perfection - have achieved first place in world trade". After 38 years, Heinrici had sold 21,000 machines.
Hot air engines.
For several decades, Louis Heinrici had built hot air engines in twelve sizes from 26 to 190 mm piston diameter and in the power range from 1.5 W to 0.2 kW. The larger machines used liquid cooling 
while, in the smaller ones, air cooling was sufficient. The running speed under load was between 120 and 200 revolutions per minute. The power output, by piston diameter, was:
The above may not be a complete list. The Stirling Engine website gives some intermediate sizes.
In the 1920s, Ernst Heinrici introduced an improved engine which could be run at up to 400 rpm. It was available in six sizes from 1/50 to 1/2 horsepower and was on sale up to 1940.
The machines could be heated by gas, liquid or solid fuels (luminescent gas, kerosene, wood). They weighed between 26 kg for the smallest and 660 kg for the largest machine.
Engineer E. Patzert, then a teacher of engineering at a school in Zwickau, carried out tests on some Heinrici machines and stated in his test report: "The experimental engines, all of which were chosen casually from a number of completed machines, were characterized by quiet, steady running and were, in terms of lubrication and maintenance, extremely undemanding".
Advantages.

His mother was Caroline François Camille du Bois de La Saussaye d'Estrelan (c. 1802–1851). He was the second child and second boy in a large family.
He entered the École Polytechnique in 1843 and became a 2nd lieutenant of artillery in 1845.
Military career (1845–75).
La Jaille was promoted to lieutenant in 1847 and captain in 1852.
He was stationed in Toulouse at the start of the Crimean War (1853–56).
He went to the Crimea as orderly officer of General de Lourmel(), who was killed during the Battle of Inkerman on 7 November 1854.
He brought Lourmel's body back to France to be buried at Pontivy, and was decorated with the Cross of the Legion of Honour.
He was appointed to the artillery of the Guard under squadron commander Laumière, and returned at once to the Crimea.
On 27 July 1855 a shell burst at his feet outside the Malakoff redoubt.
It covered him with earth and pebbles and fractured his jaw, ending his campaign.
On his return to France La Jaille was assigned to the Imperial Guard at the Tuileries Palace.
During the Franco-Austrian War La Jaille fought at the Battle of Magenta (4 June 1859) where his battery took the bridge over the Naviglio Grande from the Austrians.
La Jaille placed his pieces to the right and left of the bridge of Boffalora sopra Ticino.
His fire opened the bridge to the French infantry, who crossed it but were driven back by a regiment of Tyrolean chasseurs, who captured one of the guns.
At the Battle of Solferino (24 June 1859) his placement of the guns enabled the Guards division to take the Mont des Cyprès height.

During the senatorial elections of 1876 La Jaille was elected on 27 February 1876 as Senator of Guadeloupe on a monarchist platform by 29 votes against 27 to the Republican candidate.

Orick Peanut

The Orick Peanut is a wooden sculpture located in the parking lot of the Shoreline Deli and Market on the south side of the town of Orick located in Humboldt County, California. It was created as part of a protest against the expansion of Redwood National Park (later Redwood National and State Parks) in 1978. It is estimated to weigh 9 tons and is approximately 10 feet long and 6 feet tall.
Creation.
The Peanut was created by a group of people, including a man named Glen Schirmann. It was carved with chainsaws from a large piece of old growth redwood. It is estimated to weigh 9 tons.
The peanut shape is related to the fact that Jimmy Carter, the president at the time, was known as a former peanut farmer. The Orick Peanut was made as a mock gift for Jimmy Carter as part of a protest against his proposed expansion of the Redwood National Park, which was seen as an overstepping of federal power, a waste of money, and a move that would negatively impact the Redwood logging industry based communities in Humboldt County, like Orick.
Travels to Washington D.C..
The Orick Peanut, loaded onto a tractor trailer, led a procession of logging trucks from Humboldt County across the United States to Washington DC. The Peanut was presented to President Jimmy Carter as a mock present, along with an attached sign that read "It might be Peanuts to you, But it's Jobs to Us". The President's aides turned the Peanut away, and it was driven back, with the procession, back to Orick, where it resides today.

Carlota D. EspinoZa

Carlota D.d.R EspinoZa (born 1943, Denver, Colorado) is an American painter, muralist, and activist in her Art. She is one of the early Latina / Chicana muralists in Denver with works in Cuba, San Francisco, Texas, Arizona, and Colorado.
Early life and education.
Carlota D.d.R EspinoZa is the middle child of 14 siblings growing up first 8 years in Fraser, Colorado, and attended the Rocky Mountain School of the Arts in the 1960s and the University of Colorado Denver Metro. During the 1960s she participated in the Centro Cultural Center, organizing exhibitions for artists and was involved in the 1969 "Hispano Art Fiesta / Cinco de Mayo" events in Denver.
Career.
Early in her career, Carlota d.D.R EspinoZa painted two murals for the activist Rodolfo "Corky" Gonzales' "Crusade for Justice" center, one of which was destroyed in a 1973 fire after a bombing at the center. The surviving mural, "Mexican Heros," painted in "1966," depicts Pancho Villa and Benito Juarez and was hung at the "Crusade for Justice" center.
EspinoZa is well known for her mural of La Guadalupe that is found on the altar of Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Denver. She obtained permission to paint this work from Pastor Jose Lara who claims to have told EspinoZa, "You don't have to have a picture of a perfect Lady of Guadalupe like in Mexico. Please paint a beautiful Chicana from north Denver." The mural, "The Apparition of the Virgin Mary to Juan Diego in Mexico," was painted in 1976 and was on the altar until Father Benito Hernandez and church leadership had it removed it in 2010 under claims that the mural took away from the focus of the Holy presence. This removal stirred protests calling for the mural's return, including the gathering of 70 signatures for a letter to Denver Archbishop Charles Chaput demanding the murals restoration at the church, with EspinoZa agreeing to perform the restoration work if the church decides to remove the wall.
The mural, "Pasado, Presente, Futuro" is in the Byers branch of The Denver Public Library and "blends myth and reality, dream and truth. The past, present, future are one blood: Chicano!" This mural was commissioned by the Friends of the Denver Public Library in 1977 and included in the City of Denver Public Art collection.
Additionally, EspinoZa's screenprint "We the People, Broken Treatys. from the National Chicano Screenprint Taller, 1988-1989," is held in the Smithsonian American Art Museum. She also worked as a background and forgound artist, She has two sculpture's at the Denver.Co.Library.She also worked at the Denver Museum of Natural History for 9 nine years.
EspinoZa is also known for her work as a Chicano activist using her "art to express those in need, especially the Chicano Latino communities in Colorado."

1896 United States presidential election in North Dakota

The 1896 United States presidential election in North Dakota took place on November 3, 1896. All contemporary 45 states were part of the 1896 United States presidential election. Voters chose three electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
Although the state had been carried by a fusion ticket under the “Populist” label in 1892, unlike the other Mountain and Plains states, North Dakota was largely Catholic or Lutheran and opposed Populist and Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan’s evangelistic Protestantism. In spite of the fact that this predominantly wheat-growing state was severely hit by drought, high interest rates and problems of poor transportation, hostility to Bryan’s fundamentalism amongst the Russian-Germans of the southern part of the state was intense, while the Catholic Church under the influence of John Ireland also condemned Bryan’s free silver policy at the same time as Bryan toured North Dakota in October. There was also fear that if Bryan were elected the nation would split as severely as it had in 1861 after the election of Abraham Lincoln, and Archbishop Ireland pointed out that Bryan’s election might create class war.
For these reasons, Bryan was able to carry only the rural Scandinavian-American counties in the Red River Valley and the north of the state adjacent to Minnesota and Canada. In the predominantly German remainder of the state, Republican nominees, former Ohio Governor William McKinley and his running mate Garret Hobart of New Jersey established a Republican dominance of the state’s presidential politics that would prove permanent except during the Prohibition and New Deal era. 
McKinley won North Dakota by a margin of 11.92 percentage points, becoming the first Republican presidential candidate to win the state. He repeated this much more decisively four years later, and Bryan would prove the only Democrat to carry any of North Dakota’s counties until Woodrow Wilson in 1912 and the only one to obtain a majority in a North Dakota county until Wilson in 1916. This is the only election ever where North Dakota and Kansas didn't choose the same candidate.

Weißenstein Castle (Lower Bavaria)

Weißenstein Castle () is a ruined rock castle at a height of 758 metres on a quartz ridge, the Pfahl ("Burgberg") in the municipality of Weißenstein in the borough of Regen in the county of Regen in Bavaria.
History.
The castle was built around 1100 by the counts of Bogen. After this dynasty died out in 1242, the castle fell to the Duke of Bavaria. In 1308, the Bavarian Duke Otto and Stephen of Lower Bavaria enfeoffed Lord Eberwein of Degenberg with the castle. In 1339/40, the castle became the property of the Degenbergs.
When the Degenbergs rose up against Duke Albert IV,in the Böckler War, ducal troops under George of Lerchenfeld appeared in front of the castle on 9 December 1468. Shortly before Christmas, Weißenstein Castle was captured and burned down. However, the Degenbergs rebuilt it and remained here until their extinction in 1602 when Hans Sigmund of Degenberg died.
The castle fell to Elector Maximilian I who established the seat of the electoral "Pfleger" here. In 1633, during the Thirty Years' War, the castle was ravaged by the Swedish. In 1740, the south side of the castle collapsed, in 1742 Franz von der Trenck and his Pandurs finally destroyed the castle.
Since then, the castle has been in ruins, while the official residence and farm buildings have been restored. In 1762 a tower-like building was added, which also served as the so-called a "grain box" for the tithes of the subjects. In 1918, the writer, Siegfried von Vegesack, bought the house and made it his residence. He called it "Das fressende Haus" ("The House that Eats"), due to its high costs. This is also the title of his novel published in 1932.
Description.
The ruin, an elongated complex on a rock terrace, is separated from its domestic buildings. Besides some masonry, the square tower house has survived. The castle ruins of Weißenstein have been owned by the town of Regen since 1996. From 1991 to 1995 the ruin was renovated and is now accessible to the public.
Since 1985, the "Fressende Haus" has housed a museum and literary archive on the poet, Siegfried von Vegesack. In addition, sacred art, equipment for flax and linen production and a large collection of snuff are exhibited here. Occasionally poetry readings and other events take place here.
Below the ruins is an 1836 chapel with a baroque altar and numerous votive tablets.
Nature reserve.
The Pfahl Nature Reserve near the Ruins of Weissenstein ("Naturschutzgebiet Pfahl bei der Ruine Weißenstein") was created by the governments of Lower Bavaria and Upper Palatinate on 18 April 1940 (RegAnz. Ausg. 112/114). It covers an area of 6 hectares and extends over the rocky area including the ruins. This measure prevents all quarrying of quartz on the Pfahl. The castle hill is more densely covered in trees than the rest of the Pfahl due to centuries of fertilisation with waste. Sycamore, elder, birch and ash thrive here.
Legend.
According to a legend, a knight's wife wanted to drown her seven newborn children. The knight returned and prevented this and had his children raised in Rinchnach Monastery, but did not tell his wife. The children returned to the castle as grown men. When the lord of the castle asked what should happen to a person who had his or her own children killed, his wife replied that the person should be walled in alive. Thereupon she was walled in and is still to be seen today as a "white woman" in the ruins.

Velleia lyrata

Velleia lyrata is a small perennial herb in the family Goodeniaceae, endemic to Australia. It is found mainly near Sydney, but also near the NSW and Queensland border, and in Queensland. A map of its occurrence records is given here. It grows in damp situations in heath on sandy soils. 
The cordate base to the adaxial sepal is a feature distinguishing it from many other Velleias. A full description of the plant is given in Flora of Australia online.
The species was first described as "Velleia lyrata" by the botanist Robert Brown in 1810 and the name has never been revised.

China Agritech, Inc. v. Resh

China Agritech, Inc. v. Resh, 584 U.S. ___ (2018), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, holding that upon denial of class certification, a putative class member may not, in lieu of promptly joining an existing suit or promptly filing an individual action, commence a class action anew beyond the time allowed by the applicable statute of limitations.
Facts.
China Agritech is incorporated in Delaware and operates primarily in Beijing, China. According to the company, it manufactures and sells various agricultural products to Chinese farmers. China Agritech shares were first listed on NASDAQ in 2005. Four years later, in 2009, China Agritech reported a threefold increase in net revenue. NASDAQ initiated delisting proceedings against China Agritech's stock in 2011 after the company's shareholders made allegations of fraudulent business practices.
The company's shareholders filed two successive class action lawsuits in 2011 and 2012, but were denied class certification in both cases. Michael Resh, a shareholder, brought a third class action in 2014.
Procedural history.
China Agritech moved to dismiss Resh's complaint because the two year limitations period set by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 had already passed. The district court granted China Agritech's motion to dismiss. According to the District Court, under the Supreme Court's prior case, "American Pipe &amp; Construction v. Utah", individual claims against the company were tolled during the two class actions filed in 2011 and 2012, but the "American Pipe" did not reach the issue of whether the tolling rule also applied to a new class action based on a "substantially identical" class. The Ninth Circuit reversed the District court, holding that a class action was not time-barred in cases where the plaintiff's were unnamed in the prior lawsuits, even if the complaint was made against many of the same defendants, and based upon the same events.
Supreme Court.
In an opinion written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that upon denial of class certification, a plaintiff cannot commence a class action anew beyond the time allowed by the applicable statute of limitations, and must promptly join an existing suit or file an individual action.

Archery, Georgia

Archery is an unincorporated community in Webster County, in the U.S. state of Georgia. The community lies about from Plains.
Jimmy Carter, 39th President of the United States, grew up in Archery on a farm which is now known as the "Jimmy Carter Boyhood Farm" and is part of the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site.
History.
Archery was laid out in 1913. The community was named by William D. Johnson, an A.M.E. bishop, after the "Sublime Order of Archery", an A.M.E. social service organization benefiting poor blacks. The historic railroad community was originally built up chiefly by African Americans, who then formed a majority of its population. A large share of the residents engaged in sharecropping. Archery was first electrified in 1938. Amenities in the community included a train depot, schoolhouse, and country store.
U.S. President Jimmy Carter grew up at Archery on his family's farm from age four, in 1928, until he left for college in 1941. In Carter's time, the population consisted of approximately 25 black families and 2 white families, namely the Watsons and Carters. President Carter recalled in 1976 that Bishop Johnson was "the best-educated, most famous, the most widely traveled, and the richest member of the community". The Carter family remained at Archery until 1949; ownership of the Carter property was transferred to the National Park Service in 1994.
Arts and culture.
The Jimmy Carter Boyhood Farm, open to visitors, has been restored to its original rustic appearance. SAM Shortline Railway, a heritage railway open to the public, makes a stop on its route at the Archery Depot where visitors lead a self-guided tour.

Beryl Tsang

Beryl Tsang is a Canadian fibre artist and founder of Tits-Bits: Hand Knitted Breasts. She is original creator of the knitted breast prosthetic.
Origin.
In response to her own mastectomy following breast cancer and disappointment with commercially available prostheses, she knit one.
Seeking a prosthetic to fit an outfit for a party, she purchased a traditional silicone one and a specialised mastectomy bra. She found it to be inelegant for her evening dress and uncomfortable to wear. As an avid knitter, she knit herself one that addressed the heavy weight issue of silicone, could be worn with normal bras, and whose shape appeared more pleasing and natural under clothing.
Tit-Bits provide an alternative to the sometimes demoralizing experience of remedying the loss of a breast. They are also more economical than the cost of a traditional prosthesis, can be made in materials that feel more comfortable against the skin, and as a health benefit, do not irritate the mastectomy scar.
Beryl Tsang has participated in WIAprojects, a feminist arts-informed research and practice program at the University of Toronto, Centre for Women's Studies in Education. Her creation has also been studied as a mode for feminist action.
Press.
Tsang received much press coverage for her creation:

Craig tube

A Craig tube is an item of apparatus used in small-scale (up to about 100 mg) preparative and analytical chemistry, particularly for recrystallisation. It was invented by Lyman C. Craig and Otto W. Post.
A Craig tube consists of two parts. The first is a stout-walled test tube with a working volume of about 1-5 ml (say, 7-8 cm in length and 1-1.5 cm in diameter). There is a constriction towards the open end of the tube. The second is a loosely-fitting generally-cylindrical stopper, possibly with a teardrop-shaped head, of glass or of another inert material such as PTFE, which seats on the constriction.
Recrystallisation is carried out in the usual manner, by dissolving the solid to be purified in a solvent and causing crystals of the solid to form. The stopper can be used to protect the solution from atmospheric contamination. The crystals are separated from the mother liquor by placing the tube and stopperinvertedin a centrifuge tube, followed by centrifugation. The stopper allows the mother liquor to pass into the centrifuge tube but retains the crystals, which can subsequently be recrystallised again or collected.
The apparatus has the advantages that the crystallised product is relatively dry, is free from contamination by fibres from filter paper, and can be recovered more efficiently than from a sinter funnel.
Craig tubes can be made by competent glassblowers, and are also available commercially.

Arborough Games

The Arborough Games were an Olympics-like competition held between young people representing the cities of Ann Arbor, Michigan and Peterborough, Ontario in the 1980s and 1990s.
Creation.
In 1983, Peterborough became Ann Arbor's third sister city (after towns in Germany, and Japan; Ann Arbor has since twinned with cities in Nicaragua, Senegal and Cuba). The arrangement was inspired by Doug Walker, then head of the Ann Arbor Recreation Department, who suggested the cities set up a Junior Olympics-type exchange. The name "Arborough Games" was a portmanteau of the two cities' names.
At its height in the early 1990s, the Arborough Games brought numerous busloads of middle school students to Ontario to compete in soccer, baseball, track, volleyball, and basketball, followed by a return delegation to Michigan the following year. Participants stayed in the homes of the opposing team and enjoyed a big party after the games.
Decline.
"It was the gem of the recreation department," remembers Larry Dishman. "When it first started, so many kids wanted to participate that we had to have tryouts." But as more opportunities to play sports opened up in Ann Arbor, interest waned. Toward the end "we were so frustrated we would practically hustle kids off the streets of Ann Arbor and tell them they didn't have to pay, just come," Dishman recalls.
By the late 1990s, the Arborough Games were reduced to a biennial competition. It was finally cancelled due to a lack of volunteers after the 2000 edition.

George Huntly Lorimer

George Huntly Lorimer (born 1942) is a Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Maryland.
Career and research.
Lorimer is recognized for his work on mechanism of two proteins, RuBisCO and the GroE chaperonins. Rubisco is the enzyme responsible for photosynthetic carbon fixation, and the GroE chaperonins enable the Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent folding of many other proteins.
Using Oxygen-18 Lorimer demonstrated the oxygenase activity of RuBisCO, both "in vivo" and "in vitro". He further established the novel mechanism for the activation of RuBisCO by carbon dioxide, the formation of a lysyl-carbamate in the active site. With his colleagues at DuPont he employed chemical quench and other techniques to trap and identify the 6-carbon reaction intermediate of the carboxylation reaction and defined the complete stereo-chemical course of the reaction.
In 1989, using an unequivocally unfolded protein and the purified chaperonin proteins GroEL and GroES, his group was the first to demonstrate the ATP-dependent folding of RuBisCO and many other proteins. With Devarajan (Dave) Thirumalai he performed a bioinformatic analysis to define the structural elements of the substrate proteins that GroEL recognizes. Lorimer has also shown that GroEL can perform work on substrate protein during allosteric transitions. He has determined the crystal structure of the functional form, the symmetric GroEL:GroES2 “football” and established that the GroEL rings operate as parallel-processing, iterative annealing machines.
Awards and honors.
Lorimer is a member of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States and a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) of London. He was awarded the Humboldt Prize in 1997.

2019 National Football League (Ireland)

The 2019 National Football League, known for sponsorship reasons as the Allianz National Football League, was the 88th staging of the National Football League (NFL), an annual Gaelic football tournament for Gaelic Athletic Association county teams. Thirty-one county teams from the island of Ireland, plus London, competed; Kilkenny do not participate.
The GAA announced a new broadcast agreement on 10 January 2019, expected to run from 2019 until 2022. Eir Sport and RTÉ provided live TV coverage of the league on Saturday nights. TG4 broadcast Sunday afternoon games. The highlights programmes were RTÉ2's "League Sunday" on Sunday evenings, TG4's "GAA 2019" on Monday evenings and Eir Sport's Allianz Leagues Reloaded on Wednesday evenings.
Mayo were the winners, defeating Kerry in the final.
Experimental rules.
On 24 November 2018, the GAA Central Council approved five experimental changes to the football playing rules which were amended slightly and trialled in the 2018–19 early season competitions organised by the four provincial councils (FBD League - Connacht, O'Byrne Cup - Leinster, McGrath Cup - Munster and McKenna Cup - Ulster).
The rules trialled were –
The effectiveness of the new rules was reviewed by Central Council on 19 January 2019. Although one of the key aims of the experiment was to reduce the number of handpasses in Gaelic football, they voted 25-23 to not continue with the rule that restricted the number of consecutive handpasses to three (which was previously trialled in the 1989 National Football League and quickly abandoned). This decision followed an almost universal campaign by GAA county team managers in the media against its permanent introduction The Gaelic Players Association (GPA) were also strongly against the three handpass rule.
Experimental rules 2 to 5 (see above) were trialled in the 2019 National Football League, beginning on 26 January 2019 and ending on 31 March 2019. There was little criticism of the four rules in the league games though Jim Gavin, the Dublin manager, said the decision to experiment in the league, the GAA's second tier inter-county competition, was "disrespectful".
GAA rules only allow changes to the "playing" rules in years divisible by five which means that, at the earliest, the experimental playing rules could only be approved by Congress 2020 for implementation in the 2020 Championship.
A Special Congress was held on 19 October 2019. Three rules were passed and were introduced beginning in 2020 –
Competition format.
League structure.
The 2019 National Football League consists of four divisions of eight teams. Each team plays every other team in its division once, usually four home and three away or three home and four away. Two points are awarded for a win and one point for a draw.
Tie-breaker.
If only two teams are level on league points -
If three or more teams are level on league points, score difference is used to rank the teams.
Finals, promotions and relegations.
Division 1.
The top two teams in Division 1 contest the National Football League final. The bottom two teams are relegated to Division 2.
Division 2, Division 3 &amp; Division 4.
The top two teams in Divisions 2, 3 and 4 are promoted and contest the finals of their respective divisions. The bottom two teams in Divisions 2 and 3 are relegated.

The Secret Barrister

The Secret Barrister: Stories of the Law and How It's Broken is a 2018 book by an anonymous author with the pen name "The Secret Barrister". It is a critical first-hand account of the state of the criminal justice system in England and Wales. The subtitle is a play on words: the book is not about criminal lawbreaking, but about how the legal system is failing in its purpose.
Author.
The book's dustjacket states that the author, "The Secret Barrister", is a junior barrister practising criminal law before the courts of England and Wales. "The Secret Barrister" is also a blogger who in 2016 and 2017 was named Independent Blogger of the Year at the Editorial Intelligence Comment Awards. As of the book's publication date in March 2018 the author had a substantial following on Twitter of nearly 88,000. As of December 2020 this had risen to over 424,500 followers.
Principal themes.
The book is loosely structured to follow the life of a criminal case from magistrates' court, through to sentence and appeal. It mixes first-hand accounts of the author as advocate, acting at different times for the prosecution and the defence, with a discussion of how the system in practice fails to deliver justice on a daily basis: "Access to justice, the rule of law, fairness to defendants, justice for victims – those fine emblems which we purport to hold so dear – are each day incarnated in effigy, rolled out in the Crown and magistrates' courts and ritually torched". 
The author argues that the public should be outraged by the chronic underfunding of the criminal justice system: "In every crumbling, decaying magistrates’ court and leaking Crown Court in the land, we see every day the law's equivalent of untreated, neglected patients on hospital trolleys. And every day it is met by a wall of silence".
The almost insuperable difficulties of ensuring that defendants are defended properly and prosecuted fairly are laid out: "The magistrates' court is the accident and emergency department of criminal justice: any moment a problem will walk through the door and the prosecutor will have to deal with it blind. Much prosecuting in the magistrates’ court takes the form of someone getting to their feet and presenting a case they have never set eyes on before".
The author is particularly critical of reforms to legal aid under LASPO (the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012), called in the book "The Innocence Tax", under which a defendant can be wrongly accused of a crime by the state, denied legal aid and – when acquitted – find themselves out of pocket by tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds in legal fees that the state will not repay.
The author also addresses policy issues, and argues that "a working criminal justice system, properly resourced and staffed by dedicated professionals ... serves to protect the innocent, protect the public and protect the integrity, decency and humanity of our society. This should be a societal baseline. Not a luxury".
The criminal justice system, the author argues, has suffered grievously in recent years from chronic underfunding. Its flaws are not those of the people who work within it, but are imposed from without: by the state. Each flaw is "either deliberately designed – such as the Innocence Tax, or the restriction of compensation for miscarriages of justice – or is the product of populist, tough-on-crime, anti-defendant posturing, or betrays warped spending priorities where politicians persuade voters that one penny off a pint of lager is a better investment than a working justice system".
The author calls for proper resources to be made available to the legal system to enable it to deliver justice, for better public legal education including case law and statutes that are freely available online to the public to counter widespread public complacency ("it will never happen to me"), and for better education for backbench MPs to enable them to challenge government ministers or Ministry of Justice officials who use fallacious or dissembling arguments to gain support for a particular change in the law.
The author pays tribute to the great dedication of the professionals who work within the system: the police officers, CPS prosecutors and caseworkers, defence solicitors, judges and magistrates, court staff, probation staff, prison officers and barristers. But "It is not the enemy within, betraying our ideals of justice ... but the enemy outside. Today's danger is not the actors, but the director; the state moving the pieces and pulling the strings ... The end result is the same. When we lose sight of justice, it unfastens and floats away, leaving us with a nominal legal system; but not a justice system".
Parliament.
On the day of the book's publication it was commended in the House of Commons by the shadow Leader of the House, Valerie Vaz: "I suggest that the Leader of the House and all members of the Government read the book by "The Secret Barrister", who states: 'Walk into any court in the land, speak to any lawyer, ask any judge and you will be treated to uniform complaints of court deadlines being repeatedly missed, cases arriving underprepared, evidence lost, disclosures of evidence not being made, victims made to feel marginalised and millions of pounds of public money wasted.
The suggestion was taken up by the Criminal Bar Association and Young Legal Aid Lawyers who launched a campaign "Help us tell every MP criminal justice is in crisis" to fund the provision of a copy of the book for every Member of Parliament. The target of £10,000 was reached in three days, and it was reported that the book's publisher has pledged to match the donation.
Critical reception.
In the week after its publication in March 2018 the book was number 14 in Amazon's top 20 bestsellers list and reached the Sunday Times top five. It remained in the Sunday Times Top 10 Bestsellers list for twenty-four weeks.
The reception of professional book reviewers was uniformly positive.
Writing in "The Observer", Alexander Larman called the book "terrifying and occasionally hilarious", an eye-opening if depressing account of the practice of law today. "The Secret Barrister" paints a picture of chaos in the courts, "from trials being endlessly postponed to unprepared barristers struggling through an underfunded and unfit system ... The author leaves us in no doubt that urgent reform is needed".
Hannah Summers, in "The Guardian", noted that the author paints a damning picture of a legal system in which violent abusers walk free because evidence has gone missing and in which lawyers do hours of unpaid work to keep the system from collapse. According to the author, "the courts in England and Wales have been brought to their knees by government cuts and left so plagued by daily errors they are no longer fit for purpose".
For "The Times", Imran Mahmood called the book both a lament and a celebration, carrying a message that is delivered with great skill. In reading it, he confessed to being surprised again and again at how damaged the criminal system is. The book tells us that "the liberty of the individual depends on us regarding the justice system as not just for criminals and victims but for all of us – it is the symbol of our nation's humanity". It is "a devastating indictment", said Daniel Finkelstein, "telling tale after tale of cases that are not prosecuted properly and are not tried properly".
Stephen Bates of the "Literary Review" called the book "a truly shocking account of the working of the English courts today". Fluently and engagingly written by an anonymous junior criminal barrister, according to Bates, the book tells of underfunded, dilapidated buildings, ever-lengthening trial delays and miscarriages of justice. Bates noted that "in a staggering 87 per cent of cases" audit trails show the disclosure of evidence to defence lawyers from the police or by the hassled, overworked and understaffed Crown Prosecution Service to be unsatisfactory.
In "CL&amp;J Criminal Law and Justice Weekly" Jon Robins wrote that the book "shines an unflinching light on the nightmare of our courts", with chronic underfunding, staggering inefficiency and deathly managerialism being endemic within the system. He noted that austerity has hit the criminal justice system hard, and quoted the book's author as making it evident how dangerous a place the courts have become should you have the misfortune to end up there. That fate could happen to anyone, a thought that Robins considered "terrifying". He noted that the author lays bare the risk posed to all of us by a chronically underfunded justice system, politicians rarely having "to live with the consequences of their ill-thought out and occasionally cynical criminal justice policies".
In "The Times" publication "The Brief", Catherine Baksi called the book a rallying cry against short-sighted governments and an apathetic public who luxuriate in the misplaced confidence that they will never be wrongly accused of a crime. The book's author, she wrote, sets out with clarity and eloquence in a dozen angry, passionate and frustrated chapters a damning verdict on a system "close to breaking point", and "lays bare the result of the wrong-headed, short-sighted, politically expedient and dishonest drive to prosecute and defend on the cheap". She cited the author's view that the inexcusable "bargain basement retail model of justice" is no more than "roulette framed as justice" where decisions are "inconsistent, irrational and, at times, plainly unlawful".
Theo Barclay set out for readers of "The Daily Telegraph" the author's principal allegation: "that successive governments have neglected and wilfully abused what was the jewel in the crown of the British constitution. The verdict? Guilty as charged". He noted that "Day-in, day-out, the innocent are punished and the guilty walk free because the system is underfunded, neglected, and failing those for whom it was designed to work". He expressed hope that "this excellent book will ... raise awareness of what has been, until now, a silent crisis".
In the "New Law Journal" Chris Dale wrote that the book "make you hate politicians", pointing out that the conditions described are the result of decisions which "are the product of more than just budget-cutting; ideology and ignorance play their part, along with a cynical calculation about who votes for what".
According to Mary Cowe for "Counsel" magazine, "this book is no rant. It is passionate advocacy of the highest standard, with all the sweary asides you can't say in court".
This is "One of the best legal books of modern times" according to Kapil Summan of Scottish Legal News: "A panoptic account of its subject, measured and forensic throughout. [It is] the signal in a world of noise on justice matters and – it is hoped – a spur to action".
Second book.
In 2020 the Secret Barrister published "Fake Law: The Truth About Justice in an Age of Lies."

During the French Revolution (1789–1799), multiple differing political groups, clubs, organisations and militias arose, which could often be further subdivided into rival factions. Every group had its own ideas about what the goals of the Revolution were and which course France (and surrounding countries) should follow. They struggled to carry out these plans at the cost of other groups. Various kinds of groups played an important role, such as citizens' clubs, parliamentarians, governmental institutions and paramilitary movements.

Once Derek is rejected by Audrey and begins to question whether he really wants to be a "nice guy" or just be another "douche-bag", we follow along as his friends Julia and Lawrence try to help him through his heart-break and teach him that you should be true to yourself and not act a certain way just to get people to like you.
Production.
Production for the series began on June 25, 2017.
On August 23, 2017 Wong Fu Productions held a finale screening of the series at the AMC Atlantic Square Theaters with a special Q &amp; A with the crew after the screening and a booth to buy merchandise.
On September 25, 2017 Wong Fu Productions held another screening for the series in Honolulu, Hawaii at the Consolidated Theaters. The event sold out just a few days after tickets went on sale. The screening featured the "Just Another Nice Guy" series as well as other favorite shorts by Wong Fu Productions, with a Q &amp; A after the event and a merchandise booth.
The series was met with praise for showing that just because you are a "nice guy" doesn't mean you can expect things in return. 
“Just Another Nice Guy” challenged the Nice Guy™ trope in ways that “Just A Nice Guy” didn’t.
"Just Another Nice Guy was Wong Fu’s way of expressing to the fans and the world that even though they were rejected, these bunch of nice guys and gals don’t finish last."

Open University of Sarajevo

The Open University of Sarajevo () is a non-profit experimental school for interactive education, social activism and public debate. Themes that the school has delt with include Neo-Marxism, Yugoslavism, psychoanalysis, Third wave feminism, Crisis theory, Post-Colonialism, Historical revisionism, Post-fascism, social constructionism, revolutionary democracy, linguistic nationalism and philosophy of existence. The school has a festival format and is organized once a year in December. It nurtures the traditions of the Praxis School – a Yugoslav Marxist humanist philosophical movement, whose members were influenced by Western Marxism and organized the Korčula Summer School. The Open University of Sarajevo was an outspoken advocate of the 2014 Bosnia and Herzegovina social riots and called for the continuation of direct democracy that was established by plenums during and subsequently after the riots. The school runs a Free-to-view platform that streams all of its content online, dubbed in various languages, and archives it on its website and YouTube channel. The organizers negate the term "school", preferring to use the term "platform".
History.
The Open University of Sarajevo was founded in 2011 by a select group of leftist professors from the University of Sarajevo in cooperation with the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, the Youth Initiative for Human Rights, the "Crvena" art and culture association, the Pantheon-Sorbonne University and the Krokodil Literary Festival. The initial group of founders included prof. Dr. Asim Mujkić from the Faculty of Philosophy, prof. Dr. Enver Kazaz from the Comparative Literature Departement of the Faculty of Philosophy and prof. Dr. Dino Abazović from the Faculty of Political Sciences. Furthermore, the founding committee was joined by numerous other public intellectuals from the Former Yugoslavia, including Sarajevo-born writer and scholar Igor Štiks, award-winning Bosnian film director Jasmila Žbanić, Croatian linguist Snježana Kordić and others. The first edition of the school was held from 12 to 15 December 2011 in smaller venues, emulating the leftist café tradition of the 1960s, before Nihad Kreševljaković, the director of the Sarajevo War Theatre and grandson of Bosnian historian Hamdija Kreševljaković indirectly joined the project and brought it to his theatre two years later. In 2013 the school established the Center for Interactive Education and Social Action (CODA) with the goal of improving democratic values and promoting social, economic and political participation and emancipation in Bosnian society. The 2015 edition was the first to include a wider multimedia program and a theatrical performance directed by Serbian experimental theatre director Bojan Đorđev titled "Nije to crvena, to je krv" (That's not red, that's blood).
Format and venues.
The school is organized every December and lasts for four days. Each year's program is formed around a particular question such as "What are we afraid of?", subsequently forming topics based on said statement ("Why are we afraid of...Yugoslavism?"; "Why are we afraid of...Marxism?"; "Why are we afraid of...immigrants?" etc.) Events and lectures are held in three venues, with the main stage being the Sarajevo War Theatre. The other two venues are the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Historical Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Each day's events are organized sequentially starting from the morning. The school follows an interactive and multimedia format with theatre plays, film projections, poetry readings and interactive games being held. The theatre segments often follow the form of Augusto Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed, and are directed by notable theatre directors from the Former Yugoslavia. Each day's activities are concluded in the Sarajevo War Theatre where the main round table discussions, lectures, panels and Q&amp;A's are held. An evening symposium tops off the day. Another major aspect of the school's format is the fact that it does not require enrollment or any form of participant registration, instead opting for a grassroots and plenum format.

Embryo (video game)

Embryo is a 3D first-person shoot 'em up video game released in 1994 for the Amiga. It was developed by Croatian developer Beyond Arts and published by Black Legend. The player assumes the role of a pilot who manns an advanced fighter in order to drive the aliens invading the Earth away. The game bears semblance to flight simulation games, but is described as pure mayhem without any emphasis on realism.
Gameplay.
The aircraft can be steered with either the mouse, joystick or keyboard, whereas the player also uses buttons on the keyboard or mouse to manage weapons and flight controls. Weapons include cannons, guided and unguided missiles, energy balls and machine guns placed either frontally or sideways. The HUD displays a map, radar, speed and status reports. The game is also notable for allowing two-player co-op.
Reception.
The game received generally positive reviews upon release. The sound effects and music were lauded. Reviewers particularly praised its very smooth and fast gameplay, at the expense of the relatively simpler graphics. However, the high difficulty, specifically the toughness of the enemies, has been criticized.

Kurihara Ruins

The , shown on some maps as the Shirokita Central Park Kuirhara ruins, are the site of some ruins of a dwelling found in Nerima Ward, Tokyo, Japan. Today, a modern (1950s) reconstruction of a pit-house stands on the site and is registered as a historic site of Nerima Ward.
History.
The ruins were excavated when constructing the athletics and exercise area of in 1955. The name Kurihara was that of a small administrative unit of a village that existed in the area. In a survey conducted between 1955 and 1956, stone tools made of obsidian were excavated from the red soil (Kantō Plain loam), and were found to be from the Paleolithic age. Also, Jōmon pottery has been excavated, showing that traces of pit living from the Yayoi to the Heian periods (300 BC–1185 AD) have been found. The reconstructed dwelling depicts a construction from around the beginning of the 8th century, the early Nara period (AD 710 to 794). The reconstruction was designed by Gaijiro Fujishima, then a professor at the University of Tokyo, in 1957.
Structure.
The remnants of the dwelling were dug down to a depth of 50 cm, and four pillar holes and a clay pot were identified to the north. When restoring the house, Japanese zelkova was used for the main pillar, and Japanese cedar was used for the beams and girders. The pit-house is surrounded by a metal fence and it is normally not possible to go inside.

Gwen Le Gallienne (born Gwendolyn Hinton Perry; c. 1898–1966) was a French-born, American-raised, England-based painter and sculptor. She was the first woman allowed to sketch battlefield scenes by the British War Office. 
Life.
Gwendolyn Hinton Perry was born to Irma Perry (née Hinton) and Roland Hinton Perry around 1898. Her parents were first cousins. She was Richard Le Gallienne's step-daughter, and took the name Gwen Le Gallienne. Her mother Irma was Richard Le Gallienne's third wife, and Irma and Richard married in 1911. Gwen was considered somewhat of a celebrity, starting in the 1920s, due to her nonconformity to sexual and social norms which led her to stand out. Her personality was even notable among the Montparnasse bohemian circle. Gwen was noted for having an affair with Louise Bryant. Gwen was friends with Stephen Ward during this time. Gwen and Bryant started their affair early in 1928, which caused much strain in Bryant's marriage. Allegedly, Bryant's husband found Louise's personal notes about her affair with Gwen and this caused their divorce. Gwen was also involved with Yvette Ledeux, a nurse, but Ledeux became involved with the painter Georges Malkine on a trip they all took in January 1929. 
Career.
Gwen was exhibiting her art by her twenties. She had multiple solo shows of her work. In 1940, Le Gallienne was the first female painter who was allowed by the United Kingdom's War Office to go to war sites and paint scenes of battles. Gwen also served in British intelligence during the war.

Sarah Howe (fraudster)

Sarah Emily Howe (c. 1826 – January 26, 1892) was an American fraudster who operated several Ponzi schemes in the 1870s and 1880s, most famously the Ladies' Deposit Company of Boston. Howe was arrested in 1880 and imprisoned for three years for fraud, but upon her release she repeated similar frauds until she was arrested again in 1888.
Early life.
The details of Howe's early life are uncertain. Newspaper accounts gave inconsistent reports of her age, suggesting she may have been born as early as 1820 or as late as 1827. The "Boston Herald" claimed she was born in Providence, Rhode Island. A reported early marriage to a man named James Solomon may have been annulled due to miscegenation, followed by a marriage to a second man who subsequently died. Many of these details came from sources hostile to Howe and are difficult to confirm.
In 1852, she married Florimund L. Howe in Manchester, New Hampshire. After the American Civil War, the couple moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where she worked as a fortune teller and in various other occupations, some of them criminal. She spent several weeks in jail in 1875 after taking out multiple loans secured with the same collateral, but her conviction was overturned on appeal.
Ladies' Deposit.
Howe opened the Ladies' Deposit Company sometime before April 1879 as a savings bank that accepted deposits only from unmarried women. She told depositors that the bank worked with a Quaker charity that wanted to help women of modest means. She promised a very high interest rate on the deposits, initially described as two percent per week, which was later adjusted to eight percent per month. In fact there was no such charity and Howe relied on new deposits to pay the interest on older ones. Howe did not advertise the bank, but was able to attract $500,000 in deposits from about 1200 women in cities as far away as Chicago and Washington by relying on referrals from her depositors.
In September 1880, the "Boston Daily Advertiser" began publishing articles attacking the Ladies' Deposit as a swindle, which led to a run on the bank by its depositors. By October the scheme had collapsed and Howe was charged with multiple counts of fraud. She was convicted and served three years in prison.
Later life.
After her release in 1884, Howe set up another fraudulent bank, the Women's Bank. The new bank operated on the same principles as the Ladies' Deposit, but promised a slightly lower interest rate of seven percent per month. She accepted an estimated $50,000 in deposits before the new fraud was exposed in April 1887. Howe fled Boston before she could be indicted.
Howe attempted similar schemes in other cities, including one in Chicago under the name Ladies Provident Aid. She returned to Boston where she was arrested in December 1888, but she was released in March 1889 because victims were unwilling to participate in her prosecution. She returned to fortune telling until her death in Boston on January 26, 1892.

Shijie (Taoism)

Shijie, () which has numerous translations such as liberation from the corpse and release by means of a corpse, is an esoteric Daoist technique for an adept to transform into a "xian" ("transcendent; immortal"), typically using some bureaucratic ruse to evade the netherworld administrative system of life and death registration. The many varieties of "shijie" range from deceitful cases, such as a person feigning death by substituting the corpse of their recently deceased grandfather as their own, to supernatural cases, such as ("jianjie" 劍解, "sword liberation") using a "waidan" alchemical sword to temporarily create a corpse-simulacrum, which enables one to escape and assume a new identity.
Terminology.
Shijie.
The Chinese term "shījiě" compounds the words "shī" (尸 or 屍, "corpse; body") and "jiě" (解, "separate; divide; cut apart"), and has been described as a "rather strange name" (Seidel 1987: 230), "notoriously slippery term" (Benn 2003: 139), with "the potential for confusion" (Campany 2002: 53), and sometimes "misrepresented or interpreted in a way too vague to be intelligible" (Pas 1998: 57).
Shī (尸) has three sets of English translation equivalents in Paul W. Kroll's dictionary of Classical Chinese and Medieval Chinese:
"Shi"'s first equivalent of the ceremonial personator who was a stand-in for a deceased relative ("corpse") during Chinese funeral rituals and ancestral rites is a semantic extension of the basic meaning "corpse" (Carr 2007). Campany describes the "shi" "impersonator of deceased ancestors, one who sat in their place during the solemn presentation of food, drink, and announcements and the performance of dances" (2002: 53).
Besides the usual meaning of "corpse, dead body", "shi" 尸 can sometimes mean "body, mortal body"—particularly in "shijie" contexts. Joseph Needham translates "shijie" as "release from the mortal part" (1974: 297), which is more appropriate than "release from the corpse" because the first step in achieving "shijie" transcendence is to abandon one's corporeal body (Pregadio 2004: 117). Anna Seidel points out that "shi" in the term "shijie" denotes "all the corruptible aging factors of the physical body," rather than the corpse itself (1987: 230). Fabrizio Pregadio cites a classic Daoist text that clearly uses the word "shi" to denote "not specifically a corpse, but in general the 'mortal body', either living or dead". A passage in the c. 200 CE "Xiang'er" commentary to the "Daodejing" (see below) contrasts "shisi" (尸死) and "shisheng" (尸生), which cannot be read literally to mean "a corpse dies" and "a corpse lives". "When the mortal body dies ("shisi"), that is wearing out; when the mortal body lives ("shisheng"), that is accomplishment"; this context refers to options for a living person, and not to a postmortem renewal; "its subject, in other words, is not the 'corpse' but the 'mortal body'" (2004: 116–117). However, Campany contends that what is escaped through "shijie" is not the adept's "shi" dead body but the administrative system of death registration (2002: 53).
Owing to the ambiguities of reading the original Chinese character 尸 for "shi" "corpse; mortal body; personator of the dead; etc.", the basic meaning of "corpse" is clarified with the character "shi" 屍 that adds "si" (死, "die; death") to "shi" 尸. Compare the word "sǐshī" (死屍, lit. "dead corpse") meaning "corpse; dead body".
Jie (解) has seven sets of English translation equivalents in Kroll's dictionary:
Kroll gives "shijie" as a usage example under both "shi" 2. and "jie" 4., glossed as "'deliverance by means of a [simulated] corpse,' in which the adept's supposed corpse is buried but is actually substituted with a personal object (sword, staff, etc.) that temporarily takes on the appearance of the corpse, thus allowing one to escape from the bureaucracy of death; a lower-level means of transcendence."
Scholars propose divergent semantic interpretations of the "jie" in "shijie": "to molt," "to quarter," "to expel an affliction" (Robinet 1979: 58); "to divide, separate, disperse, to detach, deliver", "to loosen, dissolve, explain", and "emancipation, liberation" in Chinese Buddhism (Pas 1998: 58); and "release, deliverance, escape" (Campany 2002: 53). The ancient "shijie" is related with the medical term "shītǐ jiěpu" (屍體解剖, "autopsy; postmortem examination") that combines "shītǐ" (屍體, "corpse; remains") with "jiěpōu" (解剖, "dissect").
Varieties.
The forms of "shijie" are quite diverse, in its broadest meaning, the term sometimes simply denotes disappearance, "to depart on a journey through foreign lands." It more commonly designates a type of disappearance that leaves a trace behind, such as a body without its bones, or a coffin that contains only a symbolic staff, sword, or sandal. Sometimes "shijie" can even refer to an adept who comes back to life after apparent death (Robinet 1979: 58–59).
The French sinologist Isabelle Robinet compares the common forms of "shijie".
Another variation is "zhangjie" (杖解, "staff-liberated)", when the adept's bamboo staff served as a temporary stand-in for his real body, which was transformed and vanished away to the realm of the immortals (Strickmann 1979: 130).
Related terms.
"Shijie" is similar to the word "bianhua" ("transformation; metamorphosis") and its synonymous components "bian" (變, "change; alter") and "hua" (化, "change; transform"). For instance, the 499 "Zhen'gao" refers to a superior method of "shijie" called "huadun" (化遁, "to transform and escape"), and mentions "tuohua dunbian" (託化遁變, "to simulate transformation and hide by metamorphosis"); and the 983 "Taiping Yulan" describes "shijie dunbian" (尸解遁變, "delivered from the body and transformed by escaping") (Robinet 1979: 57). All types of "bianhua" require a material support, and "shijie" generally involves "going away by making use of a material object." However, there is an essential difference between them. "Bianhua" is a magical trick or the manipulation of a power that the mystic can use while alive; "Shijie" is only practiced at the end of life and is a form of deliverance linked with the purification and refinement of the body (Robinet 1993: 168).
The "huà" (化, "change; transform; convert") in "bianhua" occurs in several Daoist alternative terms for "shijie". "Jiěhuà" (解化, with the "jie" "release; etc." in "shijie") means "liberate the mortal body and attain the Dao". "Xiāohuà" (銷化, with "melt away; disintegrate") means "release the physical body and transform into a "xian"" (see the "Shiji" below). "Yǔhuà" (羽化, with "feather; wing") refers to an insect "growing wings; eclosion", which Daoists semantically extended to "die and become a "xian" flying up to heaven"; wings are a common feature in depictions of "xian", either riding a mythological flying creature or flying with their own wings—compare "yǔrén" (羽人, with "person") ""xian" transcendent/immortal; Daoist priest".
As detailed in "Early textual usages" below, the term "xingjie" (形解, "release of the form"), with "xíng" (形, "outward form, appearance, shape; figure, configuration; structure, contour, outline", Kroll 2007: 509), was a near synonym of "shijie" ("release from the corpse") that was recorded several centuries earlier.
"Tuōsǐ" (託死, "feign death; simulate death", later written 托死) frequently occurs in "shijie" contexts. Compare the Chinese Buddhist term "tuōshēng" (托生, "be reincarnated") that was also used in early Daoist texts.
Translations.
The term "shijie" has been "variously and often poorly translated" (Robinet 1979: 58). Translational difficulty stems from "shi" "corpse", and the term is usually rendered "liberation or deliverance from the corpse". However, Kirkland points out that in most accounts of "shijie" the subject did not actually die, and although all the appearances of death were involved, no corpse was really left behind (2008: 897).
English translations include:
Within this sample, "shi" is usually translated as "corpse", and "jie" most commonly as "liberation" or "release".
Early textual usages.
The word "shijie" ("release from/of the corpse") is first recorded in the c. 80 CE "Lunheng" below, but its near synonym "xingjie" (形解, "release from the form") occurs in earlier texts dating from around the 3rd to 1st centuries BCE. They do not use "xingjie" to denote a specific Daoist practice or method, but as general ways of transcending one's limited individuality (Pregadio 2004: 116). While "shijie" and "xingjie" are both instances of transcending the mortal body, they are not exactly the same, "release from the corpse" requires undergoing death but "release from the form" does not (Pregadio 2004: 117).
"Zhuangzi".
First, "xingjie" "release from the form" refers to a spiritual epiphany in the c. 3rd–2nd century BCE "Zhuangzi" story about Tian Zifang (田子方, Sir Square Field) praising his teacher Dongguo Xunzi (東郭順子, Sir Accord of Easturb) to the Marquess Wen of Wei (r. 446–397 BCE) (Pregadio 2004: 115).
After Sir Square went out, Marquis Wen spent the rest of the day in a state of dumb uncertainty. Then he summoned before him the officials who were standing on duty and said to them, "How far we are from the gentleman of complete integrity. At first I considered the words of the sages and the wise men, the practice of humaneness and righteousness to be the ultimate. But now that I have heard about Sir Square's teacher, my physical form is unstrung and I have no desire to move [吾形解而不欲動]; my mouth is clamped shut and I have no desire to speak. What I have emulated is only an earthen image, and the state of Wei has truly been an encumbrance to me." (tr. Mair 1994: 199) 
"Shiwen".
Second, the term "xingjie" (形解, "release of the form") describes an advanced self-cultivation exercise in the "Shiwen" (十問, Ten Questions), a previously-unknown medical book within the c. 200–168 BCE Mawangdui Silk Texts that archeologists discovered in a Western Han tomb (Pas 1998: 58). The fourth of the "Shiwen"'s ten dialogues (MSVI.A.4) is between the mythical Yellow Emperor and Rong Cheng (容成), a legendary ancient master of Daoist sexual practices and "Daoyin" breath circulation techniques, who says, 
Longevity is born of growth and accumulation. As for the fullness of that life: above it scans heaven and below it spreads over earth. The person who is capable of it invariably becomes a spirit. Thus he is capable of achieving release of the form. The person who perceives the great way skims the clouds as he moves. … like water flowing he can range far; like the dragon ascending he can rise high. (tr. Harper 1998: 390). 
This is the only "Shiwen" passage that reflects the likely influence of "xian" or "syncretistic-Daoist" ideas about transcendence/immortality in the Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan bamboo medical texts, which primarily discuss maintaining health and attaining longevity. Harper notes that "xingjie" "release from the form" is thought to be synonymous with "shijie" "release from the corpse", which for the Daoist believer, marked the moment of "xian" transformation when a new, immortal physique was perfected and the mortal body sloughed off, leaving behind a husk-like corpse (or an object such as a sword or staff) as evidence that the adept had achieved "shijie" (citing Maspero 1981: 445–48). However, it is evident that "xingjie" in this "Shiwen" context, with references to "becoming a spirit" above and rising "like the dragon", does not represent the concepts of "shijie" in religious Daoism (Harper 1998: 114, 124).
"Shiji".
Third, "xingjie" names a supernatural technique in Sima Qian's c. 94 BCE "Shiji" (Records of the Historian) passage denouncing the practices performed by some "fangshi" ("masters of the methods") from the state of Yan who arrived at the First Emperor of Qin's court. These masters "practiced methods for immortality [僊道] and for the release from the form through dissolution and transformation [形解銷化], relying on services offered to gods and demons." (tr. Pregadio 2004: 115). The "Shiji" commentary cites Fu Qian 服虔 (c. 125-c. 195 CE), who glosses "xingjie" (形解) as "shijie" (尸解).
The abtruse meaning of this phrase "xingjie xiaohua" (形解銷化) is illustrated in other translations:
Based upon this term "xiao" (銷, "melt [esp. metal]; dissolve"), some scholars (e.g., Robinet 1979: 66) believe "xiaohua" alludes to "waidan" External Alchemy practices, but Pregadio disagrees and says it refers to "thaumaturgic methods for replicating and multiplying one's form (ubiquity), or for dissolving it and hiding it (invisibility)" (2004: 115).
"Lunheng".
The iconoclastic philosopher Wang Chong's c. 80 CE "Lunheng" (Balanced Inquiries) has earliest known occurrences of the term "shijie" "separation from the body" (tr. Alfred Forke).
The "Daoxu" (道虛, Daoist Untruths) chapter uses "shijie" six times in a passage refuting the legend that Li Shaojun, a Daoist "fangshi" the court of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87), was several hundred years old when he died.
 The ordinary students of "Tao" have not Li Shao Chün’s age. Before reaching a hundred years they die like all the others. Yet uncultured and ignorant people still hold that they are separated from their bodies, and vanish, and that, as a matter of fact, they do not die. What is understood by separation from the body? Does it mean that the body dies, and the spirit disappears? Or that the body does not die, but drops its coil? If one says that the body dies, and the spirit is lost, there is no difference from death, and every one is a genius. And if one believes that the body does not die, but throws off its coil, one must admit that the bones and the flesh of all the deceased Taoists are intact and in no wise different from the corpses of ordinary mortals. When the cricket leaves its chrysalis, the tortoise drops its shell, the snake its skin, and the stag its horns, in short, when the horned and skinned animals lose their outward cover, retaining only their flesh and bones, one might speak of the separation from the body. But even if the body of a dead Taoist were similar to a chrysalis, one could not use this expression, because, when the cricket leaves the chrysalis, it cannot be considered as a spirit with regard to the chrysalis. Now to call it a separation from the body, when there is not even a similarity with the chrysalis, would again be an unfounded assertion missing the truth. The Grand Annalist [i.e., Sima Qian, the "Shiji" compiler] was a contemporary of Li Shao Chün. Although he was not amongst those who came near to Li Shao Chün’s body, when he had expired, he was in a position to learn the truth. If he really did not die, but only parted with his body, the Grand Annalist ought to have put it on record, and would not have given the place of his death. (tr. Forke 1907: 345–346) 
Wang Chong explains the "shijie" process with the "chán" (蟬, "cicada") analogy of a nymph molting its exoskeleton, converting into an adult, and leaving behind its exuviae; the adept transforms the body and joins with the spirit into physical immortality, leaving behind some external object in the coffin to prove that the corpse disappeared (Pas 1998: 60).
Forke also translates "separation from the body" for "lixing" (離形, "separate from the form") in another "Lunheng" chapter, "Siwei" (死偽, False Reports About the Dead). "The souls of the dead are dissolved, and cannot hear any more what men say. This inability to hear what others say is called death. If after their separation from the body they became ghosts, and kept near to men, their connection with the body would already have been severed, and, though people addressed them, it would be impossible for them to again enter the body. and close the eyes, or open the mouth." (1907: 207).
Xiang'er "Daodejing" commentary.
The c. 190–200 CE "Xiang'er" commentary to the "Daodejing", which is central to the Daoist Way of the Celestial Masters religious tradition, uses "shi" to mean not specifically a "corpse" but generally a "mortal body", either living or dead (Pregadio 2004: 116).
The "Xiang'er" commentary uses the uncommon terms "shisi" (尸死, "a corpse dies") and "shisheng" (尸生, "a corpse lives") to explain the last line in "Daodejing" Chapter 15, "Through this lack of fullness, they are able to disintegrate and be renewed" [能辭復成]" (tr. Pregadio 2004: 117). Bokenkamp interprets "shisheng" literally, "When the corpse perishes, that is disintegration; when it lives, that is "renewal" [尸死為弊尸生為成]. Only by holding to the Dao without allowing one's will to overflow is one able to transform disintegration into renewal." (1997: 100). Pregadio translates "shi" as "mortal body", "When the mortal body dies, that is wearing out; when the mortal body lives, that is accomplishment. Only by guarding the Dao without being full and overflowing is one able to transform wearing out into accomplishment." (2004: 117); noting that the passage refers to options given to a living person for their "mortal body", and not to a postmortem renewal for their "corpse".
The commentary to two "Daodejing" chapters describe an early Daoist understanding of transcendence. The adept "tuōsǐ" (託死, "feigns/simulates death") and goes to the "Tàiyīn" (太陰, Palace of Great Darkness, in the extreme north of the heavens), where their bodily form is refined, in analogy with alchemically refining base metals, resulting in "fusheng" (復生, "rebirth" or "second birth") in a body that preserves itself indefinitely (Pregadio 2018: 387). On the other hand, the damned are consigned to "dìguān" (地官, Earth Office), equated with the "Diyu" (地獄, "earth prisons; purgatories") of later texts. While the Celestial Masters recognized that death was inevitable, they sought longevity not through extended life in this world, but through the avoidance of death, described in terms of "feigned death" and continued existence in the next life (Bokenkamp 1997: 47).
"Daodejing" Chapter 33 ends with the baffling phrase "Those who die without perishing are longevous [死而不亡者壽]", which the "Xiang'er" commentary explains.
When a Daoist's practices are complete, the spirits of the Dao call that person to return. Departing the world through feigned death [避去託死], the person passes through Grand Darkness to be born again and not perish. That is longevity. Commoners have no good merits, and when they die, they belong to the Earth Office. That is to perish. (tr. Bokenkamp 1997: 135) 
Compare Seidel 's translation, "When he retires from the world, he "simulates" death and passes over to the realm of the Extreme Yin ("Taiyin")" (1987: 230).
For the Chapter 16 passage "Their bodies obliterated, they do not perish [沒身不殆]", the commentary says:
Grand Darkness is the palace where those who have accumulated the Dao refine their forms [煉形]. When there is no place for them to stay in the world, the worthy withdraw and, feigning death [避去託死], pass through Grand Darkness to have their images reborn on the other side. This is to be "obliterated without perishing." The profane are unable to accumulate good deeds, so when they die it is truly death. They are taken away in service of the Earth Offices. (tr. Bokenkamp 1997: 102) 
Pregadio specifically translates "lianxing" (煉形) as "refine their [bodily] forms", and says, "Since the release from, or rather of, the mortal body is a necessary step to continue one’s cultivation, the refining process takes place after one who is ready for it has "simulated death". Leaving one's mortal body and refining one's form results, at first, in entering again into a state in which neither form nor matter exist, but only a "xiang" (象, image, appearance). After the adept's bodily form has been refined, the process culminates in his "rebirth"." (2018: 387).
The "Xiang'er" commentary refers to those who lose faith in the Dao as "xíngshī" (行尸, "mobile corpses"). While received texts of Chapter 7 have "Is it not just because he does not strive for any personal end that all his personal ends are fulfilled?" (tr. Watson, 非以其無私耶故能成其私), the commentary has "shi" (尸, "corpse") instead of "si" (私, "self-interest; selfish concerns"), thus, "Because he is without a corpse, he is able to perfect his [mortal] corpse." 
The bodies of those who do not know the Dao of long life are but mobile corpses. It is not the Dao that they practice, but merely the way of the corpses. The reason the people of the Dao are able to achieve the longevity of Transcendents is that they do not practice the way of the corpses. They differ from the vulgar and thus are able to perfect their corpses, allowing them to enter the ranks of the Transcendent nobility. (tr. Bokenkamp 1997: 85) 
"Liexian zhuan".
Beginning with the c. 2nd century CE "Liexian Zhuan" (Biographies of Exemplary Immortals), numerous hagiographies of Daoist masters directly or indirectly mentioned them transcending death through "shijie". While many religious traditions maintain that a believer can ascend to heaven and leave behind a body, Daoist accounts of "shijie" are notable for denying that a real corpse was left behind (Kirkland 2008: 896).
Several "Liexian zhuan" hagiographies mention discovering "wushi" (無屍, "corpseless") coffins, implying that the adept had used "shijie", but only one directly refers to "shijie" (屍解). Kou Xian (寇先) was a legendary fisherman in the Zhou dynasty state of Song who lived on the banks of the Sui River (睢水) for over a century. Duke Jing (景公) of Song (r. 516-451) asked Kou to teach the "Dao" of longevity, but he refused and the duke had him executed. Several decades later Kou Xian was seen playing a "qin" lute by the Song city gate, revealing that he evaded death by means of "shijie". In later texts, this was interpreted as "bingjie" (兵解, "escape by execution") (Campany 2009: 125).
Taiqing texts.
The "Taiqing" (太清, Great Clarity) school of Daoism, which preceded the better-known Shangqing School (Highest Clarity), devised new "shijie" methods using documents to game the spirit-administration system that regulates and enforces human lifespans. In contrast to the Jewish and Christian beliefs that God records the name of every person in the "Book of Life" and "Book of Death", the Chinese believed that the otherworldly death ledger system operated like the imperial system of census family registration, with scribes keeping track of people by their names and registered places of residence.
Two exemplary "Taiqing" scriptures, both mentioned in the c. 320 "Baopuzi" below, describe novel "shijie" procedures: placing a brief listing one's own name and registration data onto one's grandfather's corpse during the funeral, and creating a Daoist "fu" (符, supernatural talisman) asserting the cause of death was illness (Campany 2002: 57). Both "shijie" procedures require that the adept and substitute corpse have similar surnames and home districts.
First, the "Taiqing yinye shenqi jing" (太清金液神氣經, Grand Purity Scripture of the Divine Pneumas of Potable Gold') quotes the mythical Yellow Thearch's instructions for preparing a legalistic brief and incantation in order to falsify the life and death ledger system.
"The Sovereign of Humanity (人皇) is familiar with all the registers of the living and the dead (死生之錄). He knows the names of the hundred ghosts and he records the surnames and bynames of the myriad spirits. If you seek a method of extending your years and increasing your longevity, you should prepare a brief (疏) to the Sovereign of Humanity, fully listing your own surname and given name, the year, month, and day of your birth anniversary, and the province, commandery, district, hamlet, village, sector, and earth-god shrine under whose jurisdiction you [are registered as] residing. Then, at the funeral of your grandfather, place this brief in the tomb and incant (祝) as follows: 'Whatever is born must die; allotted life span should accord with the registers. My name was not recorded in the Great Dark Storehouse (大幽藏), yet now I am already set to rest in Haoli. Roaming in the infernal realms, I wail over this in eternal vexation.' Having completed [this incantation], return home. In addition, you must change your surname and byname; these must not be the same as before. Thereupon you will not die in a thousand autumns or a myriad years; for the ledgers have already been fixed, and your name has forever been expunged." (tr. Campany 2002: 53–54) 
Second, the "Lingbao wufu xu" (靈寶五符序, Explanations on the Five Numinous Treasure Talismans) promises earthbound transcendence to those who follow a complex procedure involving a poisonous alchemical elixir, a mystical Daoist talisman, death meditation (cf. Buddhist "Maraṇasati"), and a "shijie" simulated corpse. The text gives instructions for compounding and ingesting a mercury-based elixir called "shijie yao" (尸解藥, "shijie" drug), and writing out in red characters (as for an imperial edict) the Numinous Treasure Talisman of the Grand Mystery for Living in Hiding (靈寶太玄陰生之符), which includes stylized Chinese calligraphy for "bingsi" (病死, died of illness), "shi" (尸, corpse), and "gui" (鬼, ghost). 
After you have ingested the Medicine for the Release from the Mortal Body for the prescribed number of days, write the talisman [of the Highest Mystery of Living Unseen] in red on white silk, and place it on your belly. On a "wu" or "ji" day [in the sexagenary cycle], lie down, your head pointing towards the west, and visualize yourself being dead [思念自作死人]. After quite some time, take off your clothes, leave them where you have lain, and head straight to enter the mountains. When you are far away, change your name. Never return to your hometown. Right after you have left, people will find that where you had lain there is a corpse. But suddenly, after a while, no one will know where your corpse is to be found. (tr. Pregadio 2018: 390) 
This Taiqing account shows that "shijie" "release from the mortal body" requires "memento mori"-like meditation practices and ritual aspects. The adept literally "stages" his or her death, and the "audience" of family members or Daoist companions participate in the "performance". They state that the corpse disappeared and was replaced by another object, such as a sword or staff. This "shijie" object performs the same function as played by the "tishen" (替身, "replacement bodies") in early funerary rites. In a ritual sense, the object replaces the deceased, whether the adept's death is real or only "simulated" (Pregadio 2018: 390–391). The same scripture also describes how to make male and female versions of a talisman for "masters of the Dao who wish to perform "shijie"", which when written with a "spirit-brush" (神筆) on any wood or metal object will immediately transform it into a substitute cadaver that will subsequently "die and depart" (Campany 2002: 54).
Comparing the two documentary "shijie" procedures, Campany finds common elements. Both involve a ritual performance (an incantation protesting one's untimely death, meditating on oneself as a corpse). Each uses an administrative document to magically activate an object (one's grandfather's corpse, one's discarded clothing) that creates an illusory substitute corpse. Both mandate a complete name change.
The usual interpretation for a practitioner who performs "shijie" to change their name is as a simple trick to elude the spirits enforcing the "registers of life and death" for each person's lifespan; the adept changes their name in the belief that the spirit-bureaucrats would be unable to locate them and cause their death. On a deeper level, Pregadio notes the homophonous correspondence between "gǎimíng" (改名, changing name) and "gǎimìng" (改命, changing destiny), and says the change of name does not merely intend to cheat the spirits, but is symbolically equivalent to the meditational and ritual act of "taking off one's clothes", that is, discarding one's old persona (Pregadio 2018: 391).
"Baopuzi".
The Daoist scholar Ge Hong's c. 320 "Baopuzi" (Master who Embraces Simplicity) reflects contemporary understanding of "shijie" during the Jin dynasty (266–420). Two "Inner Chapters" mention "shijie", and Ge's appended "Daoist Library" records the "Shijie jing" (尸解經, Classic of "Shijie"), which is no longer extant (Ware 1966: 382).
One passage about the 2nd century BCE "fangshi" Li Shaojun (李少君, mentioned in the "Lunheng" above) lists "shijie" as the lowest category of "xian" transcendents after "tian" (heavenly) and di" (earthly).
The manuals of the immortals say that masters of the highest category are able to raise themselves high up into the aery void; these are called 'celestial immortals' ["tianxian" 天仙]. Those of the second category resort to the famous mountains (and forests) and are called 'terrestrial immortals' ["dixian" 地仙]. As for those of the third category they simply slough off the body after death, and they are called 'corpse-free immortals' ["shijiexian" 尸解仙]. (2, tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 106, adapted from Ware 1966: 47, "Corpse-freed Genii") 
Based on Han dynasty sources, Ge Hong concludes that Li Shaojun must have been a "shijiexian" because long after his death from illness, Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87) had the coffin opened, and it was found to contain "only a gown and hat". Ge gives three other Eastern Han (25–220 CE) adepts who were "shijie" transcendents. Xie Yuanyi (謝元一) took Fei Changfang (費長房) away and left "a bamboo effigy to be buried in his place"; Li Yiqi (李意期) and two disciples "died" in Pixian, but when their families opened their coffins they found in each "a bamboo staff with red writing on it" (tr. Ware 1966: 47–48).
In another "Baopuzi" passage, Ge Hong denounced as a charlatan the healer Li Kuan (李寬), who treated illnesses with holy water and amulets and became extremely popular in south China. Ge's personal acquaintances who had witnessed Li's healing rituals, using "very shallow" recipes, unanimously said he was frail, senile, and no different from ordinary old people. After Li Kuan died from a virulent plague, his followers repeatedly claimed that he had metamorphosed into a "xian" transcendent through "release as a corpse and that his was not a true death". Ge concluded that Li's death proved he was "not the right type of individual" to become a "shijiexian" (tr. Ware 1966: 159–160).
In the "Baopuzi", Ge Hong considered processes like "shijie" to be perfectly natural. 
When gold and jade are inserted into the nine orifices, corpses do not decay. When salt and brine are absorbed into flesh and marrow, dried meats do not spoil. So when men ingest substances which are able to benefit their bodies and lengthen their days, why should it be strange that (some of these) should confer life perpetual? (tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 284, adapted from Ware 1966: 62) 
During Zhou dynasty funerals, amulets of jade, beads or cicadas, were placed in the mouth of the dead (Needham et al. 1976: 3).
"Shenxian zhuan".
Besides the "Baopuzi", Ge Hong also compiled the "Shenxian Zhuan" (Biographies of Divine Transcendents) that provides more information about "shijie" than the earlier "Liexian Zhuan" above. Five hagiographies of "xian" directly mention "shijie" and many others allude to it with finding empty coffins, such as Ling Shouguang (靈壽光).
Ling Shouguang was a native of Fufeng. At the age of over seventy obtained a method for [making] "efflorescence of vermilion" pills. These he synthesized and ingested, with the result that his appearance was that of a person in his twenties. By the first year of the [Latter] Han "jian'an" period [196 CE] he was already two hundred twenty years old. Later, without having shown any signs of illness, he "died" at the home of Hu Gang (胡岡) in Jiangling. Over a hundred days after his funeral and burial, someone saw Ling in Xiaohuang. This person sent a letter to Hu Gang, who, upon receiving the letter, dug up the coffin and looked inside. It was empty except for an old shoe. (tr. Campany 2002: 232) 
Wang Yuan's (王遠) hagiography has a rare description of how the "shijie" process feels. Wang explains to his pupil Cai Jing (蔡經):
"By birth, you are destined to transcend the world; you will be chosen as a replacement for an office. But your knowledge of the Way is scant; your pneumas are few and you have much flesh. You cannot ascend [directly] in this condition, but must avail yourself of shijie. It's like passing out through a dog's hole [too narrow to permit a person easy passage], that's all." Then Wang declared to Cai the essential teachings, and left him. Soon Cai felt his entire body grow hot as if on fire. He craved cold water to bathe himself in; his entire family brought water and poured it over him, and it was like making steam by pouring water over hot rocks. This went on for three days. Then, once his bones had completely dissolved, he stood up, went into his room, and covered himself with a blanket. Suddenly he had vanished. When his family looked inside the blanket, only his outer skin was left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell. (tr. Campany 2002: 260) 
Cai Jing's "shijie" is not merely escape by means of a simulated corpse that leaves behind the adept's possession (shoe, staff, etc.) but a transformative refinement that dissolves their bones (believed to be the seat of lifespan allotment) and leaves behind only their skin. Thus, Campany suggests translating Cai Jing's case as "'release from one's corpse', where the 'corpse' is all the dross of one's own former, impure body, refined away to leave one with a newly incorruptible body" (2002: 266).
The hagiography of Yin Changsheng (陰長生), who supposedly lived over three hundred years, estimates the frequency of adepts achieving "shijie". "In upper antiquity, there were many transcendents, so many that they cannot all be accounted for. But since the rise of the Han, only forty-five persons have attained transcendence—forty-six counting myself. Twenty of them did so via 'escape by means of a simulated corpse,' the rest all ascended to Heaven in broad daylight." (tr. Campany 2002: 275).
Campany summarizes five common features of "shijie" stories in the "Shenxian zhuan" and other early hagiographies.
However, not every "shijie" narrative in the "Shenxian zhuan" conforms to these patterns. When Zuo Ci and Guo Pu were condemned to execution, they escaped through "bingjie" (兵解, "martial liberation") and simultaneously eluded the agents of both the imperial and the spirit world bureaucracies (2002: 59).
"Zhen'gao".
"Shijie" is frequently mentioned in the 499 "Zhen'gao" (Declarations of the Perfected), which is Tao Hongjing's collection of materials from the "Shangqing revelations" that were allegedly given to the mystic Yang Xi (330-c. 386) by a group of Daoist Perfected Ones from 364 to 370.
Several revelations concern "shijie" methods and the destinies of Yang Xi and his aristocratic collaborators, Xu Mi (許謐, 303–376) and his son Xu Hui (許翽, 341-c. 370). Perfected Consort An (安妃) suggests "jianjie" (劍解, escape by means of a sword; here written "jiejian" 解劍) to her spirit-fiancé Yang Xi, "My lord, if you can't abide the smoke from windblown flames and wish to embrace Perfected form in a secluded wood, then could you just seek the Way of escape by means of the sword and perform the technique of announcing [your own] end? If you finish yourself off, doing it openly or in secret and leaving your trace [corpse-simulacrum] concealed or in plain view are matters to be separately arranged at the last moment. It's all up to you, discerning lord!" (tr. Smith 2013: 101).
A "Zhen'gao" revelation from Mao Gu (茅固), one of the Three Lords Mao, discloses to Xu Mi that his missing elder brother Xu Mai (許邁, 300–348), had paired with a Perfected partner, retreated into the mountains, and escaped from the world by means of a "simulated corpse" (Smith 2013: 18). Another context says Xu Mai studied under his teacher Wang Shilong (王世龍), and "received the Way of loosening constraints ["jieshu zhi dao" 解束之衜], practiced the method of walking backward, consumed jade fluid, and had audience at Brain-Essence [Palace]". This "Way of loosening constraints" may refer to the "shijie" variety called "jiedai" (解帯, escape leaving one's waistband behind) (Smith 2013: 276). Others revelations tell Xu Hui that he will perform a "nocturnal escape", which apparently means staging death under cover of night, without using a simulacrum like a sword or staff, and tell Xu Mi that he is too preoccupied with worldly affairs to escape immediately (Smith 2013: 299).
"Zhen'gao" passages provide a general outline of a complicated "shijie" process, which goes through several stages, usually over a span of many years. First, the practitioner must become "suitably detached" from worldly affairs. Second, one must be in the correct frame of mind that views life and death as opposite banks of the same river—"both are equal and essential". Third, after one escapes, the "hun" cloud-souls go to Grand Yin, the "po" earth-souls enter the earth, and the Four Numina and Five Male Ones preserve the body's seminal essence and five viscera. Fourth, once the cloud-souls arrive at Grand Yin (a place far in the north), they undergo further refinement, in a process like that which takes place in the alchemist's sealed crucible. Finally, all those who are fit for the process inevitably wake up as Perfected. "Only then can the practitioner truly understand the wondrousness of the spirit immortals' "dying but not perishing" and the profundity of the principles governing life and death". (Smith 2013: 300).
Zhao Cui (d. 622 BCE) was a legendary Daoist transcendent who assisted Duke Wen of Jin (r. 636-628), and the "Zhen'gao" records that five to six years after he died, "a man travelling through the mountains one evening spotted this corpse inside a rock chamber. The flesh had rotted, but the bones remained. He also saw that the five viscera in the abdomen were still alive as before. The [bodily] fluids and blood were wrapped in bundles therein; a purple placenta was woven on the outside." (tr. Smith 2013: 302–303)
Many "Zhen'gao" passages mention alchemical drugs as a means to achieving "shijie" "release from the corpse". Chinese alchemists were aware that the metallic compounds produced in their furnaces were highly poisonous, but they believed that the practitioner would suffer only an apparent death while in fact passing into the heavens without dying (Bokenkamp 1997: 291; Smith 2013: 284). One context lists historical figures who achieved "shijie" by consuming the powerful alchemical Elixir of Langgan Efflorescence, which was compounded from toxic heavy metals.
Those who feigned construction of a tomb after swallowing Efflorescence of Langgan are Yan Menzi [衍門子], Gao Qiuzi [髙丘子], and Master Hongyai [洪涯先生]. The residents of the three counties (in which their graves are found) all call them vacant tumuli of the dead of highest antiquity. They are unaware, though, that on one occasion Gao Qiuzi entered Mount Liujing through liberation by means of a corpse. He afterwards consumed a powder of Liquefied Gold [金液], then ingested Efflorescence of Langgan at Zhongshan and feigned the appearance of still another death, whereupon he at last entered Xuanzhou [玄州, "dark region" netherworld]. (tr. Strickmann 1979: 131, cf. Needham and Lu 1974: 296) 
These practitioners notably do not ascend into the Shangqing heavens but live among the terrestrial paradises.
The Shangqing School founder, Wei Huacun, who supposedly performed "shijie" herself (Bokenkamp 1997: 251), describes some others who performed it.
Finding the Way and leaving the world is done either visibly or in secret. Using the body to leave a trace behind is the secret [approach to] the Way. Some have taken two swigs of rose-gem essence and knocked on their coffins, or consumed a speck of it once and had their corpses rot. Sire Deerskin swallowed jade blossoms and the maggots streamed out his door; Youngest Son Qiu gulped the gold fluid and the stench was smelled a hundred "Ii" away. The Yellow Thearch, who fired the nine cauldrons [elixir] on Mount Jing, still has a tomb at Qiao Peak; Sima Jizhu, who consumed mica powder to make a covert ascent, still [left his] head and feet in different places. Mo Di gulped rainbow elixir to throw himself into a river; Young Ning consumed stone brains and rushed into a fire. Wu Guang cut leeks to enter Qingling Pool; Bocheng Zigao absorbed pneumas, and his guts rotted three times. People like these are beyond count. Isn't the Way subtle? In finding it, the traces of one's inclinations and aversions are never constant." (tr. Smith 2013: 295–298) 
Sima Jizhu (司馬季主) was a diviner for Han Emperor Wen (r. 180–157 BCE); "head and feet in different places" ("tóuzúyìchù" 頭足異凥) is a fixed expression for beheaded persons. The "Zhen'gao" translator Thomas E. Smith describes Wei Huacun as employing "graveyard humor", such as the name for mica powder, "yunsan" (云散, lit. "disperse like clouds") with "san" (散 also meaning "scatter; vanish; (TCM) powdered medicine"), which is a pun for "vanishing powder" (2013: 300).
The "Shangqing" classic "Jianjing" (劍巠, Sword Scripture) compares several "shijie" alchemical preparations and says the "lingwan" (靈丸, Numinous Bolus) elixir is the only one that permits the adept to return home without changing his or her name. The "Zhen'gao" Appendix to the "Jianjing" describes the range of different techniques.
Those who manage to escape by means of the corpse through the use of other medicines and are not transformed by means of the Numinous Bolus may not, in any case, return to their hometowns, for the Three Offices would detain them. There are those who die and revive. There are those who get beheaded, only to emerge [again] from one side. There are those whose corpses disappear before encoffinment. There are those whose human forms remain but whose bones are not recovered, those whose clothes remain but whose forms disappear, and those whose hair falls out but whose forms are lost. Departing in broad daylight is called a superior escape by corpse, and departing at midnight is called an inferior escape by corpse. (Smith 2013: 304–305) 
This passage distinguishes two grades of "shijie" by the time of day when the adept leaves the world, superior "bairi" (白日, daytime; broad daylight) and inferior "yeban" (夜半, midnight). The term "bairi" is usually translated as "in broad daylight" but more precisely means "midday; noon", in contrast to "shijie" proper at midnight. Hagiographies of Daoist immortals provide many examples of ascension to Heaven occurring exactly at midday, often expressed with the stock phrase "bairi shengtian" (白日昇天, "ascending to Heaven in broad daylight"). These two ways of deliverance are distinguished by opposite but corresponding "yinyang" features: ascent and descent, midday and midnight, light and darkness, sun and moon. On one hand, ascent to Heaven is the way of non-return to the world, a spiritual journey ascending from one empyrean to the next. On the other, descent to Great Darkness is the way of return, one obtains a "second birth" and eventually comes back to the world (Pregadio 2004: 122).
The reason for this inferior status of an adept who performs "shijie" is that despite their having attained an advanced spiritual state, it is insufficient for them to "ascend to heaven in broad daylight", and they need to undergo a transformational "refining the bodily form". As long as the adept continues dwelling in their physical body, they are able to focus upon creating their perfected body (Pregadio 2018: 391).
Logically, a question about "shijie" occurs: "If "release from the corpse" serves to leave one's ordinary body and to generate a "perfected body", why would an adept ever return to their mortal body from which they wanted to be liberated?" The famed legend of Li Tieguai ("Iron-Crutch Li"), one of the Eight Immortals in the Daoist pantheon, illustrates that the function of this "recovered" body is to provide a means to cultivate the "perfected" body. Once when Li Tieguai was in deep meditation, his spirit left his body and was roaming in the heavens, but his disciples mistakenly thought that he had died and cremated what they believed was his corpse. When his spirit returned, Li realized that since his original body was no longer available, he had to enter the only available corpse, that of a lame beggar who had recently starved to death. Thus, what is to be "perfected" through "shijie" is not the physical form, Iron-Crutch only needed a body in order to continue his Daoist practices. "Even in this uncommon case of a forced "release from the mortal body", the focus of the practice is the perfected body." (Pregadio 2018: 392).
The "Zhen'gao"'s Examination of the Corpse section is widely quoted (Strickmann 1979: 182). It gives wide-ranging criteria for verifying "shijie" "escape by an apparent corpse", reflecting the wide variety of escape methods and contingent factors (e.g., choosing to escape openly or secretly) that would tend to leave different signs on the corpse.
When a person dies, you must look at the body. If it is like that of a living person, it is in all instances a case of escape by corpse. If you see that the feet are not blue and the skin is not wrinkled, it is also a case of escape by corpse. If the light of the eyes is undimmed and no different from that of a living person, it is also a case of escape by corpse. If all the head hair has fallen out but the body and bones are missing, it is in all instances a case of escape by corpse. If an [apparent] escape by corpse occurs in broad daylight, then even though [the person] is an immortal it is not an instance of escape by corpse. (tr. Smith 2013: 300–301) 
Most of these criteria would allow a deceased master's disciples to announce that he or she had successfully achieved "shijie" "escape by corpse", except the one "broad daylight" criterion for not attaining "shijie" that actually indicates the highest form of transcendence, directly rising to heaven. Declaring successful "shijie" is easy, "none of the criteria are negative indicators of a failed quest". (Smith 2013: 301).
"Daojiaoyishu".
Even though the word "shijie" (尸解) was in use during the 1st century CE, before Buddhism had any influence in China, the meaning was probably later influenced by "jiětuō" (解脫)—the Chinese Buddhist translation of "moksha" (liberation, emancipation, release) (Pas 1998: 58). Cross-borrowings between Buddhism and Daoism were so pervasive that many narratives about Buddhist monks include supposedly distinctive Daoist practices such as "shijie" (liberation from the corpse) and "bigu" (grain avoidance) (Campany 1996: 329, 2009: 59). For instance, the 648 "Book of Jin" records that the Buddhist monk Shan Daokai (單衜開), a contemporary of the Central Asian missionary Fotudeng (c. 232–348 CE), "achieved a cicada-like metamorphosis by ingesting pills" (Needham et al. 1976: 112).
The c. 700 Buddhist-influenced text "Daojiaoyishu" (衜敎義樞, Pivotal Meaning of Daoist Teachings) describes "shijie" as the second of three types of "bianhua" transformations. 
The first is adepts who "ascend to Heaven in broad daylight" ("bairi shengtian" 白日昇天), merge with the divine, and roam together with the gods, which means that "one's entire person ascends to Heaven".
The second [type of transformation] is "release from the corpse" ("shijie"). Some replace their corpse with a sword or a bamboo staff; all of a sudden, they rise up and go, and abruptly they are no longer there. Some leave behind their skin. Some receive a funeral and are buried, but then if their coffin is opened there is only a staff or a shoe. Some roam to the five sacred peaks, while some can rise to Heaven. In the Southern Palace (Nangong) there is the Court of Flowing Fire ("liuhuo zhi ting"); in the Golden Gate (Jinmen) there is the Water of Smelting Refinement ("yelian zhi shui"). All those who inwardly ascend to Heaven while they are alive must first go to the Court of Fire ("huoting") in order to refine their form and spirit, while those who rise to heaven after their death must first go the Courtly Pond ("tingchi") in order to refine their celestial soul(s) ("hun") and body frame. All this accords with the results of their practice ("gongye"). 
The third is "transfer by extinction" ("miedu" 烕度, the Chinese Buddhist name for "Nirvana"), "The mortal form ("shixing") does not become ashes, as if the corpse is guarded by the Great One (Taiyi) itself. Sometimes, after years, the corpse reverts to be a human being." (tr. Pregadio 2004: 118). The "shijie" implements such as a sword or shoe perform a function similar to the "tishen" (替身, "replacement bodies") used in some Daoist rites to represent the adept's negative and "unrefined" aspects, worldly bonds which made it impossible for one to achieve a higher form of liberation in life (Pregadio 2004: 125–126).
Interpretations.
The term "shijie" "corpse deliverance" has "baffled scholars because the ideas and practices behind it have remained quite murky", perhaps owing to intentional secrecy among Daoist initiates (Campany 2002: 52). Academics cannot even decide how to translate the term. "Should we interpret it as deliverance of a person "from" the mortal coil of his corpse, as deliverance of a person's body from death and putrefaction, or as deliverance "by means of" a corpse? While arguments in favor of each of these interpretations have been offered, scholars essentially agree that "corpse deliverance" implies a freedom gained after either what really "was" or what "appeared to be" physical death." (Cedzich 2001: 2).
Cicada metaphor.
The oldest explanation of "shijie" is the cicada metamorphosis metaphor, which later became a standard Chinese literary trope, both of which first appeared in Wang Chong's 1st-century "Lunheng". There are multiple parallels between a "shijie" practitioner leaving behind their (sometimes apparent) corpse and transforming into a "xian" transcendent and a cicada nymph moulting its exoskeleton, emerging as an adult, and leaving behind an exuvia.
The "Shenxian zhuan" above uses the term "chántuì" (蟬蛻), which means both "cicada slough" (used in Traditional Chinese medicine) and "free/extricate oneself", to describe Cai Jing after his body had melted away for three days, "only his outer skin was left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell". Zhang Junfang's c. 1029 "Yunji Qiqian" (Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel) Daoist encyclopedia describes "jianjie" transcendence as "chánhuà" (蟬化, "cicada transformation"), "When men use a precious sword for the deliverance of the body, this is the highest example of metamorphic transformations" (tr. Needham and Wang 1956: 141).
Joseph Needham and Lu Gwei-djen say that Daoist alchemists believed immortality elixirs could generate "a new physical but immortal self, embodying the whole personality, which could leave the adept's corpse like a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis, and go off to dwell among the other immortals". Two possible results of "shijie" "liberation from the corpse" were either an empty coffin if the physical body had fully etherealized, or the changeless perpetuation of an adept's light body, never showing any signs of post-mortem decomposition (1974: 284).
Body preservation.
Needham and Lu also interpret that the remarkably well-preserved body of Xin Zhui or Lady Dai (d. 163 BCE), discovered in 1972 among Mawangdui tombs, showed that early Chinese mortuary specialists, whom they presume were Daoists, had sufficiently advanced chemical knowledge and skill to achieve an almost perpetual conservation, which suggests "for the first time all that ["shijie"] may have implied". Furthermore, they say this adds another dimension to the Daoist doctrine of physical immortality and suggests that traditional stories about incorruptible corpses were possibly based on fact (1974: 303–304). Lady Dai's body demonstrates that the Daoist conception of "shijiexian" "corpse-free immortals, whose bodies would remain century after century like those of persons still living, was not entirely imaginary (Needham et al. 1976: 21).
Ritual suicide.
Michel Strickman convincingly proposed that the adept's "corpse" in "shijie" techniques was not always a temporary stand-in but in certain cases could be the cadaver of someone who achieved "xian" transcendence by means of ritual suicide through Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning. For a Daoist religious believer, suicide could sometimes be an acceptable way to escape during periods of social or political trouble. For example, Ge Xuan (164–244) resorted to "shijie" to flee from the oppression of Emperor Wu of Jin (1979: 132–133).
In response, Isabelle Robinet contended that "shijie" "liberation from the body" was not a ritual suicide—an "interpretation that has grown up without any supporting evidence"—but instead a procedure of salvation after death. When a practitioner dies before completing spiritual purification, a kind of "partial death" takes place, with an afterlife in an intermediate realm while it awaits a more complete purification and final deliverance (1997: 138).
Ursula-Angelika Cedzich concurs with Strickman's ritual suicide hypothesis. In one of the best-documented cases, Tao Hongjing's disciple Zhou Ziliang (周子良, 497–516) received visions from Perfected Ones who guaranteed him transcendence into Shangqing heavens, and gave instructions how to compound a deadly potion of mushrooms and cinnabar, with which he committed suicide (2001: 33–34, 37–39).
Resurrection.
Another interpretation of "shijie" centers around similarities with resurrection as the concept of coming back to life after death.
Donald Harper studied documents found in Late Warring States tombs, including an official report that recounts a spectacular resurrection story. A man named Dan (丹, cinnabar), who was employed by a general in the Wei army, committed suicide in 300 BCE because he had murdered a man. After Dan's burial, however, the general filed an official bureaucratic complaint with the netherworld administration claiming that he had not yet been "fated" to die, and they subsequently released Dan from the grave and returned him to the world of the living in 297 BCE (1994: 13–14). However, it took several years after his resurrection before Dan could hear or eat food again, and "his four limbs were useless" (1994: 22–23). Harper suggests that the concept of "shijie" began around the 1st century CE from a synthesis of ancient beliefs about resurrecting the dead and the Daoist notion of "xian" transcendence/immortality, "shijie was a special form of resurrection with elements that distinguished it from an already existing belief in resurrection in popular religion" (1994: 25).
Julian Pas says that when Daoism adopted the "shijie" procedure, properly translated here not as "liberation from the body" but as "liberation through the body", it changed the focus from relying on official documents to revive a dead person to relying on self-cultivation to metamorphize into a "xian" transcendent (1998: 59). In addition, "shijie" has some parallels with Christian resurrection of the dead in which the deceased body is reunited with the soul. Describing the resurrection of Jesus, the Bible says his tomb was found empty, except for some grave clothes—which is reminiscent of Daoist "shijie" cases when the master's coffin is found empty except for some article of clothing left behind (1998: 60).
Escaping difficulties.
In some cases, a Daoist adept carrying out "shijie" "escape by means of a corpse" was not attempting miraculous transcendence but was simply absconding from difficult demands, such as when Emperor Wu of Jin indefinitely detained Ge Xuan, he told his disciple, "I do not have the leisure to prepare the great drug [of immortality]. Now I will perform "shijie"." (tr. Campany 2002: 59).
The "Book of the Later Han" gives several examples. Xu Yang (許楊) was an expert in Chinese numerology, but when the usurper Wang Mang conscripted him into the new government, Xu changed his name and became a famed healer in a distant province, and returned home only after the Han army had executed Wang Mang in 23 CE. For similar reasons, Feng Liang (馮良) supposedly killed his horse, smashed his carriage, tore his clothes to pieces, and disappeared. Everyone believed that wild animals had killed him, and his family buried the remains found at the site—but Feng returned more than ten years later (Cedzich 2011: 40).
Narratives involving this expedient type of "shijie" have common themes of name change and identity creation (Cedzich 2011: 27). This represents "a momentous abstention from the family lineage system that formed the spine of Chinese society" (Campany 2002: 55–56). The elaborate "shijie" process given above in the "Lingbao wufu xu" says, "After the adept has reached a safe place, they begin a new life under a pseudonym, but can never return home (where they might be recognized)." (tr. Campany 2002: 54). Finally, even the Shangqing patriarch Tao Hongjing himself, after years of unsuccessful alchemical experiments with immortality elixirs for Emperor Wu of Liang (r. 502–549), desperately attempted to flee his imperial patron in 508 by changing his name to Wang Zheng (王整) and pretending to be an ordinary soldier (Cedzich 2011: 40).

Official History of Australian Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Australian Peacekeeping Operations in East Timor

The Official History of Australian Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Australian Peacekeeping Operations in East Timor is an Australian official history series currently under preparation. It was approved by the Australian Government in 2015, and is due to be completed by mid-2022.
History.
Project management.
While scoping the "Official History of Australian Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and Post-Cold War Operations" in the early 2000s, the official historian for that series, David Horner judged that work should commence as soon as possible on a separate series covering the Australian involvement in the operations in Afghanistan after 2001 and the Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. However, when it approved this series in 2004, Cabinet excluded the Australian operations in East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq from Horner's remit. In 2006 Horner sought the Australian Government's agreement to expand the series to include East Timor, but this was again denied, despite no additional funds being sought for books. 
Horner continued to advocate for a new series over subsequent years. At the launch of the first volume in the "Official History of Australian Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and Post-Cold War Operations" to be published in April 2011, Horner stated that it was a "national disgrace" that work was not underway on the next series. Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd indicated that he supported such a project in his remarks when launching the book. In September 2011 the Australian War Memorial (AWM) agreed to conduct a feasibility study into an official history on the operations in Afghanistan, East Timor and Iraq. This study was completed in 2012 by Horner, who judged that it would be feasible to prepare an official history of Australia's involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq. The AWM Council endorsed this conclusion, and recommended that work begin as soon as possible. 
A submission seeking Cabinet's approval of the project was subsequently prepared. While initial versions of the submission proposed that it cover only operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, it was later broadened to also cover East Timor. The final submission proposed either expanding the "Official History of Australian Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and Post-Cold War Operations" to cover operations in the three countries up to 2006 or establishing an entirely new series. The political turmoil associated with the three changes of federal government in 2013 delayed official approval, with the submission being put forward and withdrawn on two occasions.
In 2015 the Abbott Government authorised the official history. The approved scope of the series was operations in East Timor from 1999 to 2012; Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014; and Iraq from 2003 to 2011. A total of $12.6 million was allocated to the AWM for the project in the 2015–16 federal budget. The position of official historian for the series was advertised in June 2015. Craig Stockings was appointed to this role, and commenced on the project in March 2016. Applications for authors of the volumes in the series were sought in early 2016.
There are some differences in how the "Official History of Australian Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Australian Peacekeeping Operations in East Timor" is being prepared compared to earlier Australian official history series. The budget for the project is much larger than that allocated for any previous official history, but the timeframe in which it is to be completed is also significantly shorter. In his letter commissioning Stockings as the official historian, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull specified that the series had to be completed by July 2022. Each of the authors was given five years to complete their volume, with Stockings having six years in which he is required to write a volume and edit the series. Stockings has written that the process of preparing the series "is a public service project, and needs to be managed as such". 
Despite these changes from previous practices, the authors continue to have access to all relevant files, and the freedom to reach their own conclusions. Stockings has written that the Government will not have the ability to influence the content of the books, other than to request that material which would cause security problems be omitted.
In July 2018 NewSouth won the tender conducted by the AWM for a publisher for the series.
First volume on East Timor.
In November 2019 it was reported that the official history project was "in danger of collapse amid claims that bureaucrats are trying to censor its first volume". The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) had requested a very large number of changes to the first volume on East Timor to protect the reputations of senior Australian public servants and avoid damaging the Australian Government's relationship with Indonesia. Stockings was reported to have refused to make the changes and threatened to resign over the issue, which had delayed the book's publication. Former Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has been told that the department objected to the book's first nine chapters, which cover the history of East Timor between World War II and the 1999 intervention. Downer also noted that while there may have been reasons to have not approved an official history of the intervention in 2006 due to Indonesian sensitivities, this was no longer the case. 
The official historians for the three previous official history series, Robert O'Neill, Peter Edwards and David Horner released an open letter regarding the issue on 19 November. The letter stated that censoring the volume on the grounds of diplomatic sensitivity would breach the Australian official history tradition, with material in previous series only being excluded if was information provided by foreign governments which those governments had not yet released or clearly had national security implications for Australia. The three historians called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne "to instruct her departmental officers to withdraw any objections, based on current diplomatic sensitivity, to publication of first volume of the current official history".
Stockings and the then director of the AWM, Brendan Nelson met with Payne in 2019 to discuss DFAT's handling of the volume. In January 2020 the clearance process resumed using revised arrangements, and the acting director of the AWM informed Senator Rex Patrick that the institution was confident that this approach would prove successful. Patrick expressed concern, however, over the memorial refusing a freedom of information request he had lodged regarding the matter and the possibility that the book may be "doctored".
Planned volumes.
As of March 2018, it was planned to structure the series into six volumes, each written by a different historian. The planned structure of the volumes is:
In 2017 Stockings noted that the volume on Iraq may be split into two books.

Derek Metzger

Derek John Metzger is a New Zealand singer and actor best known for his performances in musical theatre in Australia.
Metzger began his career in 1978, winning 'The Entertainers', a talent contest on New Zealand television. He represented New Zealand in two International competitions; The Asian Song Contest [Hong Kong] where he was placed 3rd. In 1980 he sang a duet [Once Again With You] with Tina Cross in the Pacific Song Contest [Canada], written by Carl Doy. The song was placed second and Derek and Tina won the 'Performance Award'. The same year he was voted Zealand's 'Rising Star'. He was a regular on NZ television through the 80s, including his own special "Derek and Friends". His 1982 single "Don't Say Goodbye" debuted at #35 on New Zealand's singles chart.
In 1981, Metzger was cast in the lead role of Jonathan for the world première and cast album of Eaton Magoon Jr and Sir Robert Helpmann's Hawaiian musical "Aloha", for Hamilton Operatic Society. In 1983 Derek revived the role in an American production of the show in Hawaii. It was followed in 1985 by a Michael Edgley revival production at His Majesty's Theatre, Auckland, directed by Joe Layton, also starring Metzger in the same role.
In 1986 Metzger moved to London where he joined the company of "42nd Street", at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. He also appeared in a production of the Musical "Matador", at the "Donmar Warehouse" and a Tribute to Noel Coward at the Piccadilly Theatre. One of the highlights of his three years in London was appearing in the Royal Variety Performance. 
He returned to New Zealand to play Anatoly in the NZ tour of Chess and to record his debut solo Album; "Me and My Songs" produced by his friend Carl Doy. 
Metzger relocated to Australia in the early 90s, where he played leading roles in a succession of productions including "Me and My Girl", "Pirates of Penzance", "The" "Mikado", "She Loves Me, Follies", "Chess, The Wizard of Oz, Pippin, Titanic The Musical," and "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying". He received a Green Room Award for Male Actor in a Leading Role in music theatre for "Me and My Girl". He received a Helpmann Award nomination for Best Male Actor in a Supporting Role in a Musical for his role of Patsy in the Australian production of "Spamalot".

H3K9me3

H3K9me3 is an epigenetic modification to the DNA packaging protein Histone H3. It is a mark that indicates the tri-methylation at the 9th lysine residue of the histone H3 protein and is often associated with heterochromatin.
Nomenclature.
H3K9me3 indicates trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 protein subunit:
Lysine Methylation.
This diagram shows the progressive methylation of a lysine residue. The tri-methylation denotes the methylation present in H3K9me3 .
Understanding histone modifications.
The genomic DNA of eukaryotic cells is wrapped around special protein molecules known as Histones. The complexes formed by the looping of the DNA are known as chromatin. The basic structural unit of chromatin is the nucleosome: this consists of the core octamer of histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) as well as a linker histone and about 180 base pairs of DNA. These core histones are rich in lysine and arginine residues. The carboxyl (C) terminal end of these histones contribute to histone-histone interactions, as well as histone-DNA interactions. The amino (N) terminal charged tails are the site of the post-translational modifications, such as the one seen in H3K9me3 .
Epigenetic implications.
The post-translational modification of histone tails by either histone modifying complexes or chromatin remodelling complexes are interpreted by the cell and lead to complex, combinatorial transcriptional output. It is thought that a Histone code dictates the expression of genes by a complex interaction between the histones in a particular region. The current understanding and interpretation of histones comes from two large scale projects: ENCODE and the Epigenomic roadmap. The purpose of the epigenomic study was to investigate epigenetic changes across the entire genome. This led to chromatin states which define genomic regions by grouping the interactions of different proteins and/or histone modifications together.
Chromatin states were investigated in Drosophila cells by looking at the binding location of proteins in the genome. Use of ChIP-sequencing revealed regions in the genome characterised by different banding. Different developmental stages were profiled in Drosophila as well, an emphasis was placed on histone modification relevance. A look in to the data obtained led to the definition of chromatin states based on histone modifications. Certain modifications were mapped and enrichment was seen to localize in certain genomic regions. Five core histone modifications were found with each respective one being linked to various cell functions.
The human genome was annotated with chromatin states. These annotated states can be used as new ways to annotate a genome independently of the underlying genome sequence. This independence from the DNA sequence enforces the epigenetic nature of histone modifications. Chromatin states are also useful in identifying regulatory elements that have no defined sequence, such as enhancers. This additional level of annotation allows for a deeper understanding of cell specific gene regulation.
Significance.
Heterochromatin marked with H3K9me3 has a pivotal role in embryonic stem cells at the onset of organogenesis during lineage commitment, and also a role in lineage fidelity maintenance.
Methods.
The histone mark can be detected in a variety of ways:
1. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-sequencing) measures the amount of DNA enrichment once bound to a targeted protein and immunoprecipitated. It results in good optimization and is used in vivo to reveal DNA-protein binding occurring in cells. ChIP-Seq can be used to identify and quantify various DNA fragments for different histone modifications along a genomic region.
2. Micrococcal Nuclease sequencing (MNase-seq) is used to investigate regions that are bound by well positioned nucleosomes. Use of the micrococcal nuclease enzyme is employed to identify nucleosome positioning. Well positioned nucleosomes are seen to have enrichment of sequences.
3. Assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) is used to look in to regions that are nucleosome free (open chromatin). It uses hyperactive Tn5 transposon to highlight nucleosome localisation.

McHughs Forest Park

McHughs Forest Park is a 43 hectare public recreational reserve on the edge of Darfield town in the Selwyn District of the South Island of New Zealand. It was established in 1893 as a plantation forest for timber and shelter, dominated by Douglas fir but with a mix of other exotic conifers.
McHughs Forest Park was formerly part of the Selwyn Plantation Board’s forest holdings and is now owned by the Selwyn District Council and publicly accessible with a diversity of walking tracks. In 1986 Dereck Rooney described McHughs Forest as "the third-best Douglas fir stand in New Zealand".
Under the planted conifer canopy is extensive natural regeneration of both native and exotic plants which harbour a diversity of animals and fungi. Members of the Canterbury Botanical Society recorded 18 ferns inside McHughs Plantation in 1986, 17 of them indigenous to New Zealand.

The Undateables (South Korean TV series)

The Undateables () is a 2018 South Korean television series starring Namkoong Min and Hwang Jung-eum. It aired on SBS from May 23 to July 19, 2018 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 22:00 (KST) for 32 episodes.
Synopsis.
It is a romantic comedy about Kang Hoon-nam who knows everything there is to know about love and Yoo Jung-eum whose biggest dream is to be loved and get married. The two of them get off on the wrong foot, first five years ago at the airport when Hoon-nam witnesses Jung-eum pursuing her then-boyfriend at the airport, and then in the present when they share the same client Oh Doo-ri and are initially misled into thinking the other is competition (although their employers are in fact in different industries). Coincidentally, two of Hoon-nam's friends get hooked up with two of Jung-eum's friends; Yook Ryong and Coach Yang, then followed by Lee Su-ji with Choi Jun-soo.
However Su-ji is longtime friends with Hoon-nam from Australia, while Jun-soo has been the best friend and mentor to Jung-eum for 30 years while also renting at her father's place for the last few years. When Su-ji returns from Australia to Korea then Hoon-nam has to leave his home for her, and ends up living with Jung-eum and Jun-soo much to the latter's chagrin.
After things initially don't work out, Hoon-nam and Jung-eum coincidentally cross paths again as both try to sign up Mr. Kim as a client. Mr. Kim has been dating their mutual client Doo-ri. Hoon-nam then signs up with Jung-eum's agency as a client. Su-ji pressures Jung-eum to manipulate the match so she is paired up with Hoon-nam, as she wants to marry him although his heart is not for Su-ji despite their other compatibilities.

Davis-Ferris Organ

The Davis-Ferris Organ, built in 1847, is the oldest three-manual pipe organ that has escaped significant alteration in the United States. It is located in the Round Lake Auditorium in the village of Round Lake, New York. Originally located in the Calvary Church in Manhattan, it was moved to its present location in 1888, where it was used in Chautauqua-like summer programs into the 1920s. It is now owned and maintained by the village. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2016.
Description.
The Davis-Ferris Organ is a basically free-standing instrument, mounted in a wooden case with Gothic features. The case may have been designed by James Renwick Jr., the architect who designed the Calvary Church where it was first installed. The case measures roughly , and is more of a protective enclosure than a structural supporting element of the instrument. It houses all of the working components of the instrument, including its three manuals, foot pedal board, air management system, and a network of wooden and metal pipes. Air movement is provided by an electric blower probably installed in the early 20th century, when the auditorium was electrified; before this time, the organ bellows were powered by a water-powered arrangement. The basic mechanical controls (stops, manuals, and the mechanisms they activate, are all basically original. Substantive changes to the instrument beyond the change in power source include the shortening of the longest pipes, needed to accommodate its new location, and it was likely revoiced after installation at Round Lake. Beginning in the 1970s, the instrument has been the subject of a long-running series of repairs to its condition, occasioned in part by a forty-year period of neglect.
The organ was built in 1847 by Richard M. Ferris for the Renwick-designed Calvary Church in Manhattan. Ferris was then briefly in partnership with William H. Davis, another organ builder, hence the name of the instrument. It remained in use at the church for about forty years, when the church vestry decided that the instrument was no longer compatible with its ecclesiastical practices. Around the same time in the 1880s, the Round Lake Methodist camp meeting was in decline as a religious venue, and had been expanding its summer offerings to include more secular Chautauqua-like summer presentations and programming. In 1888, possibly stimulated by the acquisition of the organ or prompted by its availability, the Round Lake trustees began offering musical programs as well. The organ continued to a play a role in these until the association went into decline in the 1920s.
Interest in the instrument was revived in the 1960s, after which the village has embarked on a continuing series of repairs, rehabilitation, and improvements of the instrument and the hall.

The Neon Wilderness

The Neon Wilderness (1947) is the first short-story collection by American writer Nelson Algren. Two of its stories had received an O. Henry Award. Algren received an award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters the same year.
Overview.
The book collects 24 stories: 8 previously published (from 1933 to 1947) and 16 new. Most of them are set in then-contemporary Chicago (1930s and 1940s), in the so-called "Polish-American ghetto". They revolve around the lower classes: workers and unemployed, drunkards and gamblers, prostitutes and hustlers, small-businessmen and policemen. Unlike Dickens or Zola, their general tone is tragi-comedy or sympathetic satire.
Two stories had received an O. Henry Award (and been reprinted in the related annual volume): Algren's second-published story "The Brothers' House" (1935 award) and "A Bottle of Milk for Mother (Biceps)" (1941 award). Two had been selected for "The Best American Short Stories": "A Bottle of Milk for Mother" (as "Biceps", 1942 volume) and "How the Devil Came Down Division Street" (1945 volume). The year the collection was released, Algren received an award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and a grant from Chicago's Newberry Library.
Contents.
The collection contains the following 24 stories (with first appearance for the 8 previously published).

Nicole Girard-Mangin

Nicole Girard-Mangin (11 October 1878 – 6 June 1919) was the first female doctor to serve in the French Army. She served in several roles during the entire First World War. She was also a specialist in tuberculosis (TB).
Early life.
Mangin was born in Paris on 11 October 1878. Both of her parents came from Varennes-en-Argonne, in the north-east region of France. Her father was a school teacher. 
Mangin started her medical studies in 1896. In 1899, she married André Girard, adopting his surname alongside her own as Girard-Mangin. She interrupted her medical studies to help her husband on his family's vineyard in the Champagne region. After a son was born, the couple decided to get a divorce. Girard-Mangin resumed her studies and was able to submit her thesis in 1909. She specialised in tuberculosis and contagious disease, later opening a TB clinic and starting research on cancer.
First World War.
In early August 1914, the French military was mobilising across the country. France was rapidly calling up as many soldiers, nurses, and doctors it could in advance of the war that could start at any moment. Girard-Mangin, who was still using her ex-husband's surname, was called up. There might have been an error in her paperwork, which led to a clerk thinking that he was calling up Dr. Gerard Mangin. Nevertheless, her paperwork was in order and as a result, she became the first woman doctor in the French Army; however, she lacked an official rank or the pay of a doctor.
Her first posting saw her at a former health spa in Bourbonne-les-Bains, where her superior did not approve of having a woman as a doctor there. He wrote several times to headquarters requesting that Girard-Mangin be removed from this post. His requests were consistently refused as the French army still had a massive shortage of qualified doctors. Within a week of her posting, she saw her first patients, a trainload of wounded soldiers. 
By November, she was posted to a military hospital at Verdun, where she stayed at until February 1916. She also received her first rank, as an Auxiliary Doctor, but her pay remained at nurses' level. 
In Verdun, she treated patients with typhoid. However, starting in February 1916, the German launched an unexpected attack on the Verdun section. The Germans made major advances in a short amount of time. It became apparent that the hospital where Girard-Mangin was working might soon be captured by the enemy. She was able to escape, along with all of her patients. During the evacuation, Girard-Mangin was wounded when a shrapnel piece smashed the window of the vehicle that she was in. 
Soon afterwards, she confronted her superior officer over her lack of rank and pay. After several months, she was promoted to Doctor Major, 2nd Class and awarded backpay. In 1917, she was promoted to the rank of doctor-captain and was appointed to be director of training program for nurses at the Edith Cavell Hospital in Paris. 
While in Paris, she campaigned for the French Union for Women's Suffrage. She was a participant American Red Cross sessions about tuberculosis.
Death.
Girard-Mangin died on 6 June 1919, of a suspected overdose. Her biographer suggests that she was suffering from an incurable cancer and wished to shorten her suffering.

Fincho

Fincho is a 1957 Nigerian film by Sam Zebba, and the first Nigerian film to be shot in colour. The film deals with the titular character dealing with industrialization brought to Nigeria by European colonialists, the tension between traditional and innovation, and mechanization's threat to traditional labour.
According to Zebba's self-published autobiography, the film was shot with Nigerian non-professional actors, and Pidgin dialogue dubbed by Nigerian students at the University of California, Los Angeles. The director contacted singer Harry Belafonte, who agreed to record an introduction for the film. The score was written by Alexander Laszlo, including the theme "Fincho Song" which Zebba wrote, and then sang accompanied by a small Mexican band.

Gina Ortiz Jones

Gina Ortiz Jones (born February 1, 1981) is an American intelligence officer and political candidate. She was confirmed as President Biden's Under Secretary of the Air Force by the Senate on July 22, 2021. 
The 2018 Democratic nominee for Texas's 23rd congressional district, Jones was the first gay woman of color and military veteran running for office in Texas. She narrowly lost to the incumbent Republican Will Hurd. In May 2019, she launched a second campaign for the office. In the November 2020 general election, Republican nominee Tony Gonzales defeated Jones by four percentage points.
Early life and education.
Born on February 1, 1981, in Arlington, Virginia, Jones grew up in San Antonio, Texas, as a first-generation American daughter of a single mother, Victorina Ortiz, an Ilocano from Pangasinan, Philippines. Her mother emigrated to the U.S. and earned a teaching certificate.
Jones attended college on a Reserve Officers' Training Corps scholarship, after which she became a United States Air Force intelligence officer, served in the Iraq War, and eventually reached the rank of captain.
Jones graduated from John Jay High School in 1999. She earned a four-year Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) scholarship, allowing her to enroll at Boston University. In 2003, she graduated with a bachelor's degree in East Asian studies and a master's degree in economics. A lesbian who came out to her mother at 15, Jones served under the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy, where she was at risk of losing her AFROTC scholarship if her sexual orientation was disclosed.
She later earned a master's degree in military arts and sciences at the School of Advanced Military Studies of the United States Army Command and General Staff College.
Career.
After graduating from college, Jones joined the United States Air Force as an intelligence officer and deployed to Iraq during the Bush Administration. After three years of active duty and reaching the rank of captain, she returned to Texas in 2006, working for a consulting company while caring for her mother, who had colon cancer (from which she eventually recovered).
Jones then returned to working as an intelligence analyst for United States Africa Command in Germany. In 2008, she joined the Defense Intelligence Agency, where she specialized in Latin American topics; ultimately she became a special adviser to the deputy director. In November 2016, she moved to the Executive Office of the President to serve under the Office of the United States Trade Representative. Having previously served under presidents of both parties, Jones continued in her role during the Trump administration until June 2017, when she left her role, telling "HuffPost", "The type of people that were brought in to be public servants were interested in neither the public nor the service ... That, to me, was a sign that I'm going to have to serve in a different way." She returned to San Antonio to run for Congress, living in the house where she grew up.
2018 congressional campaign.
In 2017, Jones was the first Democrat to announce a challenge to Republican Representative Will Hurd in Texas's predominantly Hispanic 23rd congressional district, which includes much of the border between Texas and Mexico. Hillary Clinton won the district by three points in the 2016 United States presidential election and neither party had controlled the swing district for more than two consecutive terms since 2007.
Jones finished first in the March 6, 2018, Democratic primary, earning 41 percent of the vote in a field of five. A runoff election was held on May 22, which Jones won. She faced Hurd in the November 6 general election, in what was called the most competitive congressional race in the state. As of June 30, Jones had raised $2.2 million while Hurd had raised $2.4 million in addition to the $1.5 million with which he entered the race. With four months remaining, Jones was approaching the district's record for election fundraising by a Democrat ($2.7 million).
Jones was endorsed by EMILY's List, the Asian American Action Fund, the Equality PAC, VoteVets, and the LGBTQ Victory Fund, as well as Wendy Davis and Khizr Khan.
Media coverage named Jones as part of several "waves" of candidates from various backgrounds running as Democrats in 2018, including women, LGBT people, and military veterans. A March 2018 "Teen Vogue" article noted that if elected, Jones would be "the first openly gay woman of color from Texas elected to Congress, as well as the first Iraq War veteran to represent Texas in Congress. She'd also be the first woman to represent Texas's 23rd Congressional district."
Jones said she believed health care reform would play a big role in the election. She and Hurd both broke fundraising records.
Jones lost to Hurd by 1,150 votes and conceded on November 19.
2020 congressional campaign.
In May 2019, Jones launched a second campaign for Texas's 23rd congressional district. She has raised over $1 million for her campaign, including $100,000 in the 24 hours following Hurd's August 2019 announcement that he would not seek reelection. In October 2019 "The Texas Tribune" reported that she was the primary front-runner. In May 2020, former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg's Win the Era PAC endorsed Jones.
In the November general election, Republican nominee Tony Gonzales defeated Jones by four percentage points.
Personal life.
Jones has a younger sister who is an intelligence officer in the United States Navy. She identifies as an Ilocano, a Filipino ethnolinguistic group.

Carrie Hall

Carrie May Hall (July 5, 1874 – November 17, 1963) was a nurse who held several senior leadership positions in hospitals and within the American Red Cross during the First World War.
Early life.
Hall was born in Nashua, New Hampshire in 1874. She graduated from the Massachusetts General Hospital School for Nurses in 1904. After graduation, she was the superintendent of the Margaret Pillsbury Hospital in Concord, New Hampshire until 1911.
She was the first superintendent of nurses at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, now named Brigham and Women's Hospital. The hospital has been affiliated with Harvard University and had a teaching hospital for both nurses and doctors. She was a principal of the Peter Bent Brigham School of Nursing for her entire career at the hospital. She formalized the curriculum for nurses, including expanding classroom education. The three-year course she created graduated its first class of five nurses in 1915.
First World War.
A unit of medical staff from Brigham Hospital, which was the nicknamed the "Harvard Unit", left for France on May 11, 1917. They were one of the first units sent over after America had entered the war just a month before on April 6, 1917. Hall was appointed Chief Nurse and Dr. Harvey Cushing was appointed as director of the unit. The unit was posted to the British Expeditionary Force. The unit took over a General Hospital 11 from the British. As the American Expeditionary Force had not yet arrived, Hall and her unit treated mostly British and Canadian soldiers. In a letter to the New England Red Cross, she described that her hospital could manage up to 700 soldiers within a 24-hour period and not be overwhelmed. In September 1917, Hall was managing 108 nurses and assistants in the base hospital and forward operating areas.
At the time, nurses were given no rank in the military structure. Hall wrote to her family where she vented frustration at the insubordination of other ranks towards her and other supervisors.
After nearly a year in her position, she was transferred away from the front-lines to become the chief nurse of American Red Cross in Great Britain. There she saw the war end, with the armistice being signed on November 11, 1918. In early January 1919, she was appointed as the chief nurse of the American Red Cross in France.
After the war.
She returned to her position of superintendent at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. In addition to her role at the hospital, she worked on improving education across the country for nurses and also campaigned for better pay for nurses which included advocating for nurses pension plans. As part of her advocacy, she gave several addresses at various conferences and to nursing associations across the country. at several conferences including speaking at the Graduate Nurses' Association in DC.
She served on the board of the National League of Nursing Education for ten years starting 1922. She held the position of president from 1925 to 1927.
She retired from her position at Brigham hospital in 1937. In her honor, the hospital named a conference room for her. After her retirement in 1939, she was elected Vice President of the Community Nursing Council of Boston.
She died on November 17, 1963.

Dane Laffrey

Dane Laffrey is an American scenic designer best known for Broadway shows "Once on This Island" (2017), "Spring Awakening" (2015), and "Fool for Love" (2015), and Off-Broadway shows "The Christians" (2015), "Cloud Nine" (2015), and "Rancho Viejo (2016)."
Early life and education.
Laffrey was born in Michigan. He attended boarding school at Interlochen Arts Academy for his junior and senior years of high school. In 2002, he relocated to Sydney, Australia to study design at the National Institute of Dramatic Art. He graduated in 2004.
Career.
Laffrey first served as scenic designer and costume designer on Darlinghurst Theatre Company's production of "Some Explicit Polaroids" and Griffin Theatre Company's production of "The Cold Child" in 2006 in Sydney, Australia. He was nominated for a Sydney Theatre Award for Best Set Design for "Some Explicit Polaroids" that same year. The following year, he again served in both roles for the production of "The Colour of Panic" at Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia and Det Apne Teater in Oslo, Norway.
In 2007, he relocated to New York City where he began designing sets, costumes, and one time-lighting for multiple Off-Broadway, Off-Off-Broadway, and regional productions. Notable Off-Broadway productions include Lucas Hnath's "The Christians", Dan LeFranc's "Rancho Viejo", and Caryl Churchill's "Cloud Nine". He was nominated for four American Theatre Wing Hewes Design Awards for Off-Broadway productions between 2010 and 2017.
In 2015, he served as the set designer for Manhattan Theatre Club's production of "Fool for Love" at The Friedman Theatre on Broadway and as both set designer and costume designer for Deaf West Theatre's production of Spring Awakening, performed in American Sign Language, at The Brooks Atkinson Theatre on Broadway. In 2017, he served as set designer for Circle in the Square's production of "Once On This Island" on Broadway. Laffrey and Michael Arden, the show's director, took a research trip he took to Haiti which completely transformed his approach to designing the set for the production. Laffrey stated: "You cannot begin to describe the effect that trip had on me as a person but also in feeling equipped to responsibly bring this work to Broadway in 2017 in a way that was true to the piece and what it portrays ... Hurricane Maria happened in Puerto Rico and the storms that affected those tiny little islands in the Bahamas. We continued to collect and pull those images because it felt like ‘Island’ is ultimately dealing with, at its core, how you survive in the face of something like that and the restorative power of storytelling. You feel that connection of the human spirit threaded through all these places."His design for "Once On This Island" received widespread positive critical acclaim with multiple media outlets describing it as "a fractured paradisiac vision", "lush [and] immersive", "evocative", "ambitious", and "an aesthetic experience unlike anything else on Broadway."
In 2017, Laffrey was awarded the Obie Award for Sustained Excellence of Set and Costume Design.
Laffrey has served as an advisor for Lincoln Center Theatre's LCT3 and as a guest designer at Yale School of Music, the Juilliard School, New York University, Carnegie Mellon University, Interlochen Arts Academy, Western Sydney University, and the National Institute of Dramatic Art.

Hinge (app)

Hinge is a dating app which bills itself as the "only dating app" that emphasizes long-term connections between users. Hinge has sought to allure a younger demographic than Match.com and eHarmony.
History.
Founded by Justin McLeod in 2012, Hinge developed their mobile app in early 2013 and launched it that February. The app was designed to be less superficial than Tinder, dispensing with Tinder-like swiping and using the slogan "the relationship app".
Before Hinge gained enough users to sustain the business, the company nearly ran out of funding. When making the mobile app, McLeod spent much of their remaining cash on a launch party in Washington D.C. which enabled them to obtain their next round of funding, saving it from insolvency.
In 2017, Hinge received more mentions than other dating apps in the "Weddings" section of "The New York Times". Hinge Matchmaker was released in September 2017 to reinvent online dating for "people that missed out on the dating app craze".
Match Group made investments in Hinge as early as September 2017. On June 20, 2018, Match Group acquired 51% ownership of Hinge, with the right to acquire all remaining shares within a year, which it exercised. Match Group owned 100% of Hinge by the first quarter of 2019.
The app's popularity was boosted in 2019 when US presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg revealed that he had met his husband on Hinge.
Also in 2019, Hinge started Hinge Labs to research successful matches and fine-tune the compatibility algorithm and other features.
Operation.
Presented in a vertical timeline, profiles on Hinge are composed of pictures plus three self-selected personal prompts, which encourage users to focus on personality traits rather than just appearance. Instead of swiping, users must respond to specific photos or prompts when liking a profile. Hinge allows users to filter matches based on traits that are important to them, such as religion or height.
Unlike other dating apps, users can message other users without first requiring a "match". As a ghosting countermeasure, a "Your Turn" feature reminds a user to continue a conversation.
In 2018, Hinge launched a "We Met" feature allowing private confirmation that matches have had a first date, in order to find more compatible matches.
In July 2018, Hinge rolled out its "most compatible" feature, which uses the Gale–Shapley algorithm to determine the best matches for users. Once per day, users are assigned a match that Hinge claims is the best pairing, based on user likes and passes.
Hinge formerly used Facebook friends to facilitate connections. In 2018, the app moved away from using friends of friends as a predictor of compatibility, and it was redesigned to no longer require Facebook login.
Marketing.
Hinge marketing focuses on its "designed to be deleted" theme, with its mascot, Hingie, getting roasted in a campfire, encased in ice in a freezer, run over by a cab, flattened by an air-conditioner, etc., when two Hinge users fall in love. In 2020, the app launched Hingie Shop, selling products that can be "destroyed" such as bath bombs and s'mores.

Elsie Barlow

Elsie Frederica Barlow (1876 – 15 November 1948), was an Australian painter and printmaker. She was a founding member of Twenty Melbourne Painters. She was also the first woman to have a solo exhibition in Castlemaine, Victoria.
Biography.
Elsie Frederica Barlow née Hake was born in 1876 in Melbourne, Australia. She was one of seven children, the youngest of six girls born to Sidney Hake and Charlotte Hemsley.
In 1894, Barlow enrolled at the Gallery School of Design where she was taught by Frederick McCubbin and Lindsay Bernard Hall. She attended the National Gallery School with her sister Dora Serle. Elsie and Dora both showed an early interest in art, taking classes at St Kilda Town Hall when they were kids. 
She was represented in an exhibition of Australian art at the Grafton Galleries London in 1898. Her painting "Welcome News" came second to Max Meldrum for the National Gallery School Travelling Scholarship in 1897.
In 1901 she married police magistrate Arthur Barlow, assistant to Sir John Madden. They had three children, a son Basil in 1904, daughter Nancy in 1906, and Betty in 1907 who died a few months after birth. They lived in Maryborough in 1909 and moved to Castlemaine in 1912. 
In 1912 Barlow held a one woman show at the Mechanics' Institute in Castlemaine, where she displayed 90 paintings. This led to the eventual creation of the Castlemaine Art Gallery. 
She had a studio in Collins Street with her sister Dora from 1899 to 1901. Barlow moved to Melbourne in 1916 and Arthur died shortly after. She opened a new studio in the Dunklings Building in Melbourne in 1919, holding an exhibition of 76 paintings and 6 pen drawings in June of that year. 
She is acknowledged as the first woman to paint snowscapes which she would do by leaving the paper to weather outdoors while visiting her friend May Vale at Sassafras. 
Barlow was a founding member of the Twenty Melbourne Painters Society.
Barlow died in a private hospital in Mentone, Victoria on 15 November 1948.
Legacy.
Retrospectives of her works were held in 1977 (at the Castlemaine Art Gallery) and 1978 (at the Duvance Galleries) to honour her as one of the founders of the Castlemaine Art Gallery and Historic Museum.
Hacke Place in the Canberra suburb of Conder is named in her honour and that of her older sister Dora, the misspelling of their maiden name being gazetted in 1988.

Memorial Hall of the Boxer Uprising

The Memorial Hall of the Boxer Uprising (天津义和团纪念馆) in Tianjin is the only museum dedicated to the Boxer Rebellion in China. Also known as the Tianjin Boxer Rebellion Memorial, Luzutang Museum, or simply the Boxer Museum, it is located No.18 Hejia Lane, Ruyi'an Street, Hongqiao District, in Tianjin.
History.
The building was originally a Taoist Temple, built in 1719. Sacrifices were held to honour the immortal Lü Dongbin. During the Kangxi period of the Qing dynasty, the temple was rebuilt and named "Lüzutang" (吕祖堂).
In 1900, during the Boxer Rebellion, Boxer leader Cao Futian set his headquarters in the old temple. An altar was built at the temple's main entrance. The Boxer leaders would burn charms, and followers would then drink the ashes mixed in strong wine. They believed this could summon gods and ancient heroes and make them possess their body, rendering them resistant to the bullets fired by the Eight-Nation Alliance. The Red Lanterns supposedly stared at the setting sun to gain the ability to invoke lightning.
In 1985, the building was restored and renamed Tianjin Boxer Rebellion Memorial Hall.
Today.
The museum is still currently open. Exhibitions are held concerning the Boxer rebellion history and the Boxer leaders and organisation.

2019 Open Championship

The 2019 Open Championship was the 148th Open Championship, played at Royal Portrush Golf Club in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It was the second Open Championship at Portrush, which last hosted in 1951, won by Max Faulkner. Royal Portrush saw major alterations in preparation for the tournament, including replacing two of the holes.
Shane Lowry won his first major title by six strokes over Tommy Fleetwood. Ranked 33rd coming into the tournament, Lowry's previous biggest wins were the 2015 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and the 2019 Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship. Lowry became the second player from the Republic of Ireland to win a major after Pádraig Harrington.
Lowry shot 67 in both the first and second rounds to share the lead with J. B. Holmes after 36 holes. He shot a course record (since the 2016 renovation) 63 in the third round to have a four-stroke lead over Tommy Fleetwood going into the final day. After shooting a 72 in challenging conditions on the last day, Lowry was able to convert a four-shot 54-hole lead into major victory, after failing to do the same at the 2016 U.S. Open at Oakmont. Fleetwood finished solo second for the second time in a major, having previously achieved the feat at the 2018 U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills.
Major champions Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowell, and Rory McIlroy competed in a major in their native Northern Ireland for the first time. Clarke was given the honour of the opening tee shot and described the event as a watershed moment for Northern Ireland, as hosting was seen as unrealistic during the years when violence ravaged the province. McIlroy was the pre-tournament favourite but shot an 8-over-par 79 in the first round, which included a quadruple bogey eight on the first hole, a double bogey five on the 16th, and a triple bogey seven on the 18th. Despite shooting a 6-under-par 65 in the second round for a two-over-par total, he missed the cut by a single stroke. 
Clarke also missed the cut, and McDowell finished tied-57th.
Defending champion Francesco Molinari made the cut on the number and finished tied for 11th with a 3-under-par 281. Brooks Koepka finished tied 4th to become the fifth player, after Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods, to finish top-five in all four majors in a single season.
The 36-hole cut was 143 (+1) and better; 73 advanced to the weekend, but no amateurs, so the Silver Medal was not awarded this year.
Media.
The 2019 Open Championship was televised by the Comcast Group in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland (both on Sky Sports), and the United States (Golf Channel on its cable service on Thursday and Friday, while on NBC its broadcast service on weekends). It was the fourth year of both channels airing the tournament, but the first since Comcast acquired Sky in late 2018, vertically integrating the two. At the 2019 Players Championship, Comcast integrated the two channels' coverage for the first time since the acquisition, and is expected to feature coverage from both networks' commentators.

The Open Qualifying Series (OQS) consisted of twelve events from the six major tours and the Korean Tour. Places were available to the leading players (not otherwise exempt) who finished in the top "n" and ties. In the event of ties, positions went to players ranked highest according to that week's OWGR.
The Final Qualifying events were played on 2 July at four courses covering Scotland and the North-West, Central and South-coast regions of England. Three qualifying places were available at each location, with 72 golfers competing at each. (R) indicates a golfer who came through Regional Qualifying (RQ). Sam Locke and Ashton Turner were successful at Final Qualifying for the second consecutive year. Brandon Wu was exempt from RQ because he was ranked in the top ten in the World Amateur Golf Ranking, while Tom Thurloway was exempted by winning the 2018 English Amateur closed championship. Other qualifiers were exempted from RQ by virtue of a top 1000 Official World Golf Ranking at the date of entry.
To make up the full field of 156, additional places were allocated in ranking order from the Official World Golf Ranking at the time that these places were made available by the Championship Committee. The first 14 alternates were added using the week 25 rankings on 26 June; two of those declined spots and were replaced by the next two alternates.
Round summaries.
First round.
"Thursday, 18 July 2019"

Tiger Woods hit his highest first round score in the Open, a seven-over 78. J. B. Holmes opened with 66 for a one-shot lead over early leader Shane Lowry. It was the second time he'd led in a major championship, the other time being the second round of the 2008 PGA Championship at Oakland Hills. Rory McIlroy shot an 8-over-par 79 which included a quadruple bogey eight on the first hole, a double bogey five on the 16th and a triple bogey seven on the 18th. Two weeks after his win at the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open, Jon Rahm finished two shots off the first-round lead.
Second round.
"Friday, 19 July 2019"
After round two, Shane Lowry and J. B. Holmes shared the lead on eight under. Brooks Koepka sat at tied-8th, the 12th consecutive major he'd been in the top 20. Four players, Justin Harding (T5), Xander Schauffele (T18), Kevin Streelman (T48) and Rory McIlroy (MC), posted a second round 6-under-par 65, the current course record (since renovation). 73 professionals and no amateurs made the cut line of 143 (+1). McIlroy missed the cut by one stroke, for the first time since 2013. Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson both missed the cut, the first time this had happened in 83 majors. Local resident Graeme McDowell, and defending champion, Francesco Molinari, made the cut on number.
Amateurs: Kanaya (+2), Sugrue (+2), Schmid (+5), Wu (+7), Knipes (+9), Thurloway (+14)
Third round.
"Saturday, 20 July 2019"
Shane Lowry shot an 8-under-par 63 to break the course record since it was remodeled in 2016. His 197 set a new 54-hole scoring record at the Open, beating the 198 set by Tom Lehman in 1996 at Royal Lytham &amp; St. Annes. He became the 12th player since 2000 to be leading in a major by four or more strokes, with only three of them failing to go on and win, including Lowry himself at the 2016 U.S. Open. Lee Westwood sat tied-6th in his 82nd major start, which is the second highest number of major starts without a victory, with only Jay Haas (87) having more. The light afternoon winds favoured the later starters, and led to lower scores than in the first two days. 
Final round.
"Sunday, 21 July 2019"
Summary.
Sunday’s tee times were moved forward due to the adverse weather forecast. The first tee time for the final round at Royal Portrush was at 7:32am BST, with the two leaders beginning their final round at 1:47pm. Shane Lowry shot a 1-over-par 72, with only Tony Finau scoring lower (71) out of the players in the top 10 after round 3. It meant Lowry won with a six shot margin ahead Tommy Fleetwood, the highest winning margin in a major since Martin Kaymer in the 2014 U.S. Open. Lowry had a clear lead throughout the round, and was generally praised for his composure in testing weather conditions, with some remarking about the similarity to his 2009 Irish Open win when he still had amateur status.

Second Battle of Morlancourt

The Second Battle of Morlancourt was fought over the period 4–14 May 1918, on the Western Front during World War I. The battle took place during the final stages of the German spring offensive. The battle began as a peaceful penetration action launched over several days by troops from the Australian 9th Brigade, to advance their lines around Morlancourt through a series of small raids against the opposing German 199th Division. Afterwards, both sides rotated their forces in the area and the Germans subsequently launched a counter-attack against the Australian 5th Brigade. This attack was eventually repulsed and the line held until June, when the Third Battle of Morlancourt took place around Morlancourt as the Australians secured the Morlancourt spur to consolidate their positions on the Somme before the Allied Hundred Days Offensive.
Background.
Situated on the northern bank of the River Somme, Morlancourt is about north-east of Amiens, in the Somme department of northern France. The battle took place against the backdrop of the German spring offensive, which saw the Germans launch an offensive on the Western Front that had rapidly gained ground through the Somme after it had commenced on 21 March. In late March, troops from the Australian 3rd Division had clashed with the German 18th Division in the First Battle of Morlancourt, when the Australians advanced to fill a gap in the Allied line that had formed north of the River Somme as the Germans had continued their advance towards the railhead at Amiens. The Australian advance was checked just short of their objective, the cross spur overlooking Morlancourt. In April, the Germans had launched a thrust south of Ypres towards the railhead at Hazebrouck and the channel coast during the Battle of the Lys.
By April, the Australian 3rd Division's line between the Somme and the Ancre, representing a frontage of around had advanced very little since the First Battle of Morlancourt. To improve command and control along the front, on 22 April the two Australian divisions holding the line in the area – the 3rd and the 5th – were reorganised, pushing their boundaries further north, so that the two rivers were incorporated inside the lines of the same formation, rather than being sitting astride them. The 10th Brigade (Brigadier General Walter McNicoll) of the 3rd Division took over some of the line previously held by the 7th Brigade, 2nd Division. They began working to advance their line forward north of the Ancre as the line in this sector was nearly behind the line on the south side.
Battle.
In late April, the 11th Brigade (Brigadier General James Cannan), which held the line south of the 10th Brigade, was relieved. Their replacements were the 9th Brigade (Brigadier General Charles Rosenthal). This brigade had been detached from the 3rd Division earlier and had taken part in the fighting during the First Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. Due to heavy casualties, the 9th Brigade had been reduced to three battalions: 33rd, 34th and 35th Battalions. Its fourth battalion, the 36th had been disbanded to provide reinforcements to the other battalions in the brigade. It had been given two weeks' rest before being rotated into the line, where they assumed a position between the 10th Brigade on their left and the 5th Division's 8th Brigade on their right.
On 29 April, while touring the front, it had become apparent to Rosenthal that his brigade's outpost positions on his right were isolated and vulnerable due to a series of sunken roads, vegetation and other terrain features that provide cover for a German surprise attack. Rosenthal decided it was necessary to push his line forward across the valley to the next slope. The 34th Battalion, holding the southern part of the 9th Brigade area, was detailed for the task. They would be supported by the 3rd Pioneers and fatigue parties from the 33rd Battalion, to dig trenches and lay out wire obstacles. The 35th Battalion, holding the northern part of the brigade front, would clear several German positions in front of its line to the protect the flank of the 34th Battalion. Direct fire support was provided by the 10th Machine Gun Company, while the 9th Light Trench Mortar Battery provided indirect fire support.
Between 4 and 9 May, the Australians attempted to capture the German front line positions around Morlancourt, which were held mainly by troops from the 237th Reserve Infantry Regiment, 199th Division. Using peaceful penetration tactics, the Australians launched raids over several nights. The raids proved largely successful, except for an abortive attempt on 7 May, when the late issuing of orders resulted in a hasty and poorly co-ordinated operation that resulted in a company from the 34th Battalion – with reinforcements from the 33rd – being cut off, after having broken into positions held by the German 114th Infantry Regiment. Surrounded on each flank, when daylight came, the company was forced to surrender. The raids succeeded in advancing the Australian line . Casualties during the fighting in the first part of May amounted to 264 killed or wounded for the Australians and at least 170 Germans captured.
After the loss of their front line positions, the Germans reinforced their positions around Morlancourt. The 31st Infantry Regiment was detached from the 18th Division and loaned to the 199th Division, moving into the line around the Bray–Corbie Road. The Australians also rotated their forces, with the 2nd Division relieving the 3rd, who had been in the line for almost seven weeks. On 11 May, the area around Morlancourt was assigned to the 5th Brigade, consisting of the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th Battalions, which had been out of the line resting. As the 2nd Division's 6th Brigade began preparing to capture Ville to the north, the 5th Brigade began sending out patrols opposite Morlancourt, securing several prisoners and machine guns.
Throughout 13 May, efforts were made to locate a German outpost opposite the 17th Battalion and at 3:00 am the following day 4.5-inch howitzers from the 107th and 108th Batteries shelled the position. A patrol was then sent out to ascertain the effect of the shelling but it was turned back by heavy machine gun fire, which confirmed that it was still intact. At 3:45 am, the Germans retaliated with a heavy artillery bombardment against the 17th Battalion's positions around the Bray–Corbie Road. Following this, the Germans launched a counter-attack against the 5th Brigade with 200 troops, seeking to regain some of the positions lost to the 34th Battalion during the earlier Australian raids. The attack overran several Australian posts before it was checked and then after a heavy mortar barrage, the three forward Australian companies launched their own counter-attack which subsequently cleared the trenches and released the Australians that had been temporarily taken prisoner. By 10:30 am the fighting had concluded with another 48 soldiers from the German 31st Infantry Regiment being captured. Against this, the Australians had lost a further 60 men killed or wounded.
Aftermath.
Following the failed counter-attack, the Germans rotated their forces along the Morlancourt front, bringing the 107th Division into the line, while throughout 15 May the German artillery fired a heavy bombardment of the Australian lines. Minor actions continued along the line until 18 May as the 18th Battalion sought to shore up its left flank. This included a daylight raid across no man's land, during which the Australians took advantage of the heat of the day when many of the German sentries were asleep, to surprise a German position. The Australians reached their objective without a shot being fired. After the Australians threw a grenade, the remaining Germans in the trench surrendered. There was a brief exchange of fire with a neighbouring position, which was quickly overcome before the raiding party returned to their lines. A total of 22 Germans were captured in the raid. Elsewhere, in late May, the Germans launched the third major blow of their Spring Offensive, attacking the French in Third Battle of the Aisne.
On 10 June 1918, the day after the Germans launched an attack aimed at the Montdidier–Compiegne–Soissons railway, a third battle took place around Morlancourt. This saw the Australian 7th Brigade capture the Morlancourt spur, which overlooked village of Sailly-Laurette, to the south of Morlancourt. The Australians then worked to consolidate their position ahead of further actions on the Somme, including the Battle of Hamel in early July. Capture of the spur completed the process which had begun with the earlier two battles and helped the Allies set the conditions required for further actions prior to the final Hundred Days Offensive. The final Allied offensive began in August 1918 and ended the war. As a result of the final battle, 325 Germans were taken prisoner, while the Australians lost 400 killed or wounded.

Ruth Shellhorn

Ruth Patricia Shellhorn (1909-2006) was a Los Angeles-based landscape architect of the post-war era. She is known for the development of the "Southern California Look". With a focus on indoor/outdoor living, she incorporated topography and nature into urban settings to create sustainable landscapes in her designs for residences, retail, city and regional parks, universities, and colleges. 
She was the "Los Angeles Times" 1955's woman of the year.
Her work on the Shoreline Development Study became a precedent for development along the California Coast.
She designed Bullock's department store, the Fashion Square shopping centers at Santa Ana, Sherman Oaks, La Habra and Del Amo in Torrance. In 1956 she was hired by Walt Disney to create a comprehensive pedestrian circulation system for Disneyland, establishing central landscaping elements of the park.
Early life and education.
Shellhorn was born on September 21, 1909 and grew up in Pasadena. Her father was a dentist and her mother volunteered at numerous civic and city beautifying organization. Her parents encouraged her to pursue a profession that used both her mathematical skills and her artistic mind. Her neighbor, landscape architect Florence Yoch inspired her and recommended that she become a landscape architect.
After high school, Shellhorn attended the School of Landscape Architecture at Oregon Agricultural State College from 1927 to 1930. While she was there, she was the first woman to win the Alpha Zeta Scholarship Cup. She also won an award in a national Beaux-Arts design competition.
In 1930 she transferred to Cornell University, where she took engineering and architecture classes. She was the only woman in her class of six in the Department of Landscape Architecture. She originally did not receive her degree, she was considered 4 units short. However in 2005, Shellhorn’s records were reviewed by Cornell and she was awarded degrees in Architecture and Landscape Architecture.
When she returned to Southern California in 1933, she was one of the rare designers to be professionally trained which distinguished her from most male practitioners.
Works.
Shellhorn was also a major advocate for Land Studies. She spent two years working with the Shoreline Development Study for the Greater Los Angeles Citizens Committee. She focused on bringing restrictions on oil drilling in Santa Monica Bay, a precedent for the goals of the later-enacted California Coastal Act, an advocate for the use of public funding for recreation and parkland acquisition. The study also set precedent for Los Angelos's first sewage treatment plant.

Aluto–Langano Geothermal Power Station

The Aluto–Langano Geothermal Power Station, also known as Aluto Langano Geothermal Power Station, is the only geothermal power station in Ethiopia.
Location.
The facility is located within the dormant Aluto volcano, a volcanic complex of the Ethiopian Rift valley trending NNW–SSE with several craters up to 1 km wide, between Lake Langano and Ziway. The site is approximately , by road, southeast of Addis Ababa, the largest city and capital of Ethiopia. The geographical coordinates of this power station are: 07°47'19.0"N, 38°47'41.0"E (Latitude:7.788611; Longitude:38.794722).
Overview.
The Aluto—Langano geothermal field at the dormant Aluto volcano covers an area of about and is considered to be capable of generating up to of electric power. It features temperatures in excess of 300 °C in a high-temperature up-flow dome at a minimum subsurface depth of around 1200 meters. The geothermal field and its characteristics like stratigraphy, geochemistry and hydrothermal behavior are relatively well explored.
The Aluto—Langano Geothermal Power Station (dubbed "Aluto–Langano I") is the oldest geothermal power station in Ethiopia, established in 1998 with a nameplate capacity of and a net power generation capacity of . In 1998, the power station was considered a pilot plant to explore the features of the Aluto–Langano geothermal field, it used four of the eight drilled wells. It is still the only geothermal power station in Ethiopia 20 years later on in 2018.
Two small wells (LA-3 &amp; LA-6) deliver high pressure high temperature steam from areas of high temperatures in excess of 300 °C to a conventional combined cycle steam turbine, while the non-condensed exhaust steam and mid-temperature mid-pressure steam from two other small wells (LA-4 &amp; LA-8) drive a bottoming combined cycle steam turbine. Both turbines were considered to deliver around each. A re-injection well (LA-7) exists as well.
Several events (in particular corrosion, but also hydrothermal blockages, leakages, lack of operation knowledge of the plant personnel) led to several drops in the power generation capabilities several times between 1998 and 2018, followed by extensive repairs and rehabilitation works addressing in particular corrosion damages. The pilot power plant was out of operation for most of its existence. For most of the operating time, only the conventional combined cycle unit was operational (with only the two wells LA-3 &amp; LA-6 operating). In 2018, the Aluto—Langano Geothermal Power Station was able to generate less than of electric power and is essentially mothballed.
Expansion / replacement works (dubbed "Aluto—Langano II") started in 2013 and delivered two more high-temperature wells in excess of 300 °C (LA-9D &amp; LA-10D). Future works (from the viewpoint of 2018) are set to expand the total generating capacity of the geothermal field to ~ by re-using the existing wells and by drilling another 8 large production-ready wells. New power generating units, which are able to withstand the corrosive steam, have to be installed as well.
The Aluto—Langano Geothermal Power Station is one of three grid-ready geothermal power stations in the country in different phases of operation or construction, the other two are the ~ "Corbetti Geothermal Power Station" (exploration phase) and the "Tulu Moye Geothermal Power Station" (exploration phase), also with a capacity of ~500 megawatts.
History.
First exploration works started in 1981. The feasibility studies for this power station were conducted in 1986. The report concluded that the area could support a commercially viable geothermal power station. In 1998, a geothermal power station was erected to prove the production ability of the geothermal field, with 7.3 MWe net capacity.
One of the two power generation turbines went out of operation already in December 1999, the second one stopped working in 2001. Rehabilitation works put the conventional combined cycle steam turbine back into operation by 2007 and the bottoming combined cycle steam turbine back into operation in 2009, but the effective power generation capacity of both turbines was reduced to ~ 5 MWe. Ageing contributed to a decrease of power output again and in 2018, less than 1 MWe was generated. The second turbine is essentially decommissioned and the power plant almost out-of-operation.
Currently, the Ethiopian Ministry of Mines &amp; Energy is in the process of expanding the plant. The International Development Association has committed to lend US$126 million of the projected total cost of US$218 million. In March 2018, the EEP advertised for a contractor for the project. The selected company is expected to provide two geothermal drilling rigs and accessories, rig operations and maintenance for drilling geothermal wells along with all the accessories, heavy machinery, trucks and vehicles. In February 2019, EPP contracted Kenya Electricity Generating Company to drill steam wells.
Ownership.
Aluto—Langano Power Station is owned by "Ethiopia Electric Power" (EEP), the national electricity monopoly.

Nickel bis(dimethylglyoximate)

Nickel bis(dimethylglyoximate) is the coordination complex with the formula Ni[ONC(CH3)C(CH3)NOH]2. The compound is a bright red solid. It achieved prominence for its use in the qualitative analysis of nickel.
Structure.
The geometry of the nickel(II) ion is square planar. It is surrounded by two equivalents of the conjugate base (dmgH−) of dimethylglyoxime (dmgH2). The pair of organic ligands are joined through hydrogen bonds to give a macrocyclic ligand. The complex is distinctively colored and insoluble leading to its use as a chelating agent in the gravimetric analysis of nickel. 
The use of dimethylglyoxime as a reagent to detect nickel was reported by L. A. Chugaev in 1905.

Freaky Friday (2018 film)

Freaky Friday is an American musical television film that premiered as a Disney Channel Original Movie on August 10, 2018. Based on the 1972 book "Freaky Friday" by Mary Rodgers and the 2016 Disney Theatrical Productions stage adaptation by Bridget Carpenter, the film stars Cozi Zuehlsdorff and Heidi Blickenstaff.
Plot.
The film starts off with Ellie and her two friends, Karl and Monica, discussing participating in a big activity with their classmates called "the Hunt", an annual school-wide scavenger hunt. Ellie's brother Fletcher comes in and does a magic trick, but she is unimpressed and tells him to get out. Fletcher, insulted, then steals an hourglass that Ellie's late father had given to her, thereby upsetting his sister.
Meanwhile, her mom Katherine Blake is preparing for her impending wedding to her fiancé Mike. To add to her stress, she is also organizing and catering the wedding. She and Katherine fight and Katherine wishes that Ellie would take more responsibility for herself, while Ellie wishes her mother would understand what it is like to be her. When they start eating breakfast, Ellie asks her mother if she can go to the Hunt, but her mother says no because it scares her. Fletcher's pet bunny goes missing and Mike says he will help find the bunny, Ellie snaps at Mike and says that he is not their dad. Katherine demands that Ellie apologize, but Ellie refuses to apologize. Katherine asks Mike to take Fletcher to school, and Ellie storms to her room.
When Katherine follows Ellie to her room they fight over the hourglass and switch bodies, frightening them. They realize that Ellie's hourglass switched them and must find the identical hourglass given to Katherine, but realize that Katherine sold hers and they must find it. Katherine goes to Ellie's school and Ellie stays at the house. When Katherine arrives at Ellie's school, Savannah, a mean girl, bullies her and says that she will win the Hunt, which worries her. Ellie's crush Adam comes to Katherine and asks her for her lunch, which confuses Katherine but she gives it to him anyway. He tells her if she is going to the hunt which she asks why nobody cares about their grades but then says why the Hunt is a big deal which he says he wants to live up to his brother and wants to bring people together which Katherine thinks is very mature and goes off to class.
When Katherine goes to class she tells Karl and Monica that she won’t be going to the hunt, which surprises them. Ellie then goes to the Venue. When Ellie and Mike do their dance it goes awry and Ellie destroys the cake which upsets her helper Torrey. Back at Ellie's school Savannah keeps bullying Katherine and dumps her tea on her, and when Katherine goes to the restroom to clean up the tea she realizes that Ellie's been keeping a belly button piercing from her, which upsets her a lot. When Ellie and Katherine go to Ellie's parent-teacher conference the principal tells them that when Ellie gets bored she skips class for eleven days, which makes Ellie and Katherine both upset. Katherine starts talking about why that's been happening which is about her dad which makes Ellie upset. Then Katherine reveals the piercing which she tells her that she is grounded.
Ellie then goes to the hourglass store with Fletcher but realizes it's out of business. Then she realizes that if the hourglass is on the hunt then she can go get it. Ellie then asks Katherine to ask Adam to put the hourglass on the hunt which she agrees and tells him but he says no because he is the list master which causes her to say it is a childish game which makes him upset. To make matters worse Karl and Monica come over and say that she has been acting super weird today and says she is focused on the hourglass which makes them upset.
Katherine takes Fletcher on a walk and tells him that parents lie and he will never go to Vegas. He becomes upset and runs away. At the rehearsal a lot of things go wrong, with Torrey quitting, Karl and Monica deciding to ditch "Ellie", and she tells Mike she's rethinking the wedding, which upsets Katherine. Katherine, Ellie and Mike realize Fletcher has gone missing and go find him. Adam finds Fletcher and convinces him to return home. Adam then says that he might consider putting the hourglass on the list.
Ellie begs Karl and Monica to put "Ellie" back on the team, which they agree to. Katherine says Ellie should do the hunt, but because of their switch, Katherine says she should do it. "Off the Isle", the magazine that was going to feature Katherine's wedding, decides not to but Ellie convinces them to cover the wedding.
Ellie then tells Mike she is not mad at him and loves him, and decides to treat Fletcher better. Katherine obtains the hourglass in a fight with Savannah and wins the hunt. She then goes to the wedding and is supposed to switch bodies with Ellie but it does not work. The wedding starts, but she stops it and declares how much she loves Katherine, which causes them to switch back and they reconcile. The wedding resumes and everyone dances at the reception.
Production.
The film is based on the novel "Freaky Friday" by Mary Rodgers, and Disney's stage adaptation of the novel. Heidi Blickenstaff reprises her role as the mother, Katherine Blake, from the stage version, and Cozi Zuehlsdorff plays the daughter, Ellie Blake. Steve Carr serves as director and executive producer, Bridget Carpenter serves as screenwriter, Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey serve as composers, Susan Cartsonis and Thomas Schumacher serve as executive producers, and John Carrafa serves as choreographer. The film premiered on Disney Channel on August 10, 2018.
Reception.
During its premiere in the 8:00 PM time slot, "Freaky Friday" attracted a total of 1.58 million viewers with a 0.29 rating for people aged 18–49, making it the lowest-rated Disney Channel Original Movie premiere of the last decade, until the premiere of "Kim Possible" in 2019. Over the course of seven telecasts during the first three days of airing, the film attracted a total of 7.2 million viewers, including 3.1 million among kids 6–14.
The film received mostly positive reviews, with critics specifically noting that the film's cast and musical numbers helped justify its existence as a remake. Audiences questioned whether the musical number 'Oh, Biology' was appropriate for its intended audience, as it featured Katherine expressing her desire towards Adam - a high schooler - while in her daughter's body.

The Lost (Durst novel)

The Lost is a 2014 novel by Sarah Beth Durst. It tells the story of Lauren Chase, a woman who decides to go for a long drive rather than face the results of tests her mother has had, and who ends up in the fictional town of Lost.
Actress Selma Blair bought the rights to the novel in 2018 intending to adapt it to film.
Plans for a sequel called "The Missing" were already in development by the time the novel was published.
Plot.
Lauren Chase is a young woman from California who has allowed her mother to move in with her after her struggles with cancer. After realizing that her mother's cancer might have returned Lauren gets into her car and drives all day. Caught up in a dust storm Lauren hallucinates a mysterious man with feather tattoos on his chest and winds up in the town of Lost where she is given free food and lodging. Preparing to go home the following morning she is once again caught up in the dust storm. After driving in and out of it several times she is eventually rescued by the tattooed man who turns out not to be a hallucination. Returning to Lost looking for help, Lauren is told that she will receive aid from the Missing Man. However when Lauren meets the Missing Man and tells him her name he refuses to help her or the other residents of Lost and walks away. As none of the residents can leave Lost until the Missing Man helps them, they are terrified of Lauren and shun her. After an angry mob sets upon her, Lauren is rescued by a six year old child named Claire who rescues Lauren as she is the only person she has ever seen independently walk in and out of the dust storm. Lauren is taken to the apartment of Peter, who turns out to be the man with the tattoos. Peter tells Lauren that only lost things and people end up in Lost and no one can leave without the Missing Man. Peter, who is a "finder" of the lost, decides to help Lauren as she is the only other person, aside from himself, who the Missing Man has ever refused to help.
Lauren and Claire, and eventually Peter, decide to seek shelter in one of the many abandoned houses around Lost. Claire and Peter teach her to survive by scavenging. Lauren holds out hope that she will one day be able to leave even without the Missing Man and eventually spends an entire day biking around the outskirts of Lost, looking for a weakness in the perpetual dust storm that surrounds the town. Instead she realizes there are no weaknesses, and witnesses the void toss up cars, lost objects, and a house. Returning, Peter shows Lauren some of the things that the void has left them, including the lost paintings "The Storm on the Sea of Galilee" and "Chez Tortoni", in order to comfort her.
As the Missing Man continues to stay away from Lost, the void that borders the town begins to move closer. Lauren goes to investigate and finds Veronica, a waitress who has become crazed after her lover, Sean, was taken by the expanding void. Veronica threatens to shoot Lauren and Lauren offers to go into the void looking for Sean, knowing that Peter will try to rescue her. Lauren does not find Sean but she does find a ring. She and Sean are rescued by Peter and when Lauren shows them the ring Sean recognizes it and uses it to propose to Veronica. The two develop the glow that Lost residents obtain when they are ready for the Missing Man to send them away from Lost. 
Sean and Veronica spread the news about Lauren and more Lost residents begin to show up at her door looking for help. Lauren manages to help several of them, including one resident who trades information about her own death for the location of Claire's parents, who did not in fact abandon her as she believed, but who moved to Scottsdale, Arizona after being devastated over her disappearance. Despite the fact that she is able to help people, Lauren continues to want to return to her mother. To help her Peter goes finds the Missing Man. The Missing Man eventually returns and tells Lauren that her mother is dying but she cannot yet return to her as she has yet to discover the reason she came to Lost. He also teaches Lauren to help people with the glow move on by placing her hands on them and saying "You were lost; you are found." Lauren accidentally uses this technique to send Claire back to the real world. Devastated she creates a found object art piece which gives her the glow, since what sent her to Lost was the fact that she had abandoned her creativity and desire to make art. Peter begs Lauren to stay as the town of Lost needs her to continue sending people back to the real world. He also confesses he loves Lauren, but she sends herself back to the real world. 
Lauren wakes up in a hospital where she learns that she has been in a coma for three months and was found in a car accident on the very day she left home. Her mother is also in the hospital having been diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer. Lauren is convinced that Lost was a hallucination, but she continues to find objects from Lost in the real world, objects she could not have known about before. Beginning to believe Lost was real, Lauren decides to take her mother there since the people of Lost never leave and even if dead their souls remain in the town. Before she can leave with her mother however her mother's condition worsens forcing her to remain in the hospital. Lauren tells her mother about her plan to leave and Lauren's mother told her they would have never found Lost together since Lauren's mother was never lost as long as she had Lauren. 
After her mother's death Lauren gets in her car and prepares to return to Lost. She first seeks out Claire. Unexpectedly, when she arrives in Scottsdale she sees that Claire has integrated happily back in real life. Lauren drives on until her car runs out of gas looking for Lost. She is about to give up hope that she will find it when she finally walks straight into the dust storm.

Austramathes pessota

Austramathes pessota is a species of moth in the family Noctuidae. It is endemic to New Zealand and is found in Northland, in the southern North Island and in the South Island, mainly on the eastern side of that island but is also present in Fiordland. It is not regarded as being present in either Dunedin or the Southland district. This species lives in shrubland at altitudes ranging from sea-level up to subalpine. As at 2017, the larvae have yet to be described or photographed but it is known that they feed on "Melicytus alpinus" and it is likely that "Melicytus micranthus" is also a host. Adults of this species are distinctively patterned and coloured. Its appearance differs from its close relatives such as "A. purpurea" as it lacks the purple hue that can be seen on the latter species forewings. It also differs from "A. coelacantha" as it is much darker and has a distinctive small, round, pale mark on its forewing. Adults are on the wing from December to April.
Taxonomy.
"A. pessota" was first described by Edward Meyrick in 1887 under the name "Miselia pessota" using specimens collected in Christchurch. In 1906 this species was tentatively placed in the genus "Sympistis" by George Hampson. Meyrick, in 1911, disagreed with this placement but somewhat doubtfully suggested placing the species in the genus "Hypnotype". Meyrick again reconsidered the taxonomy of this species in 1914 and placed it within the genus "Andesia". IN 1988 J. S. Dugdale agreed with this placement. Robert J. B. Hoare undertook a major review of New Zealand Noctuidae and placed it within the genus "Austramathes" in 2017. The female lectotype was collected at Riccarton Bush and is held in the Fereday Collection at the Canterbury Museum.
Description.
As at 2017, the larva of this species has not been described nor photographed. 
George Hudson described the adults of this species as follows:
The adult male of this species has a wingspan of between 25 and 28 mm and the female has a wingspan of between 28 and 32 mm. This species is distinctively patterned and coloured. Its appearance differs from its close relatives such as "A. purpurea" as it lacks the purple hue that can be seen on the latter species forewings. It also differs from "A. coelacantha" as it is much darker and has a distinctive small, round, pale mark on its forewing.
Distribution.
This species is endemic to New Zealand. "A. pessota" can be found in Northland, in the southern North Island and in the South Island, mainly on the eastern side of that island but is also present in Fiordland. This species is not regarded as being present in Dunedin or the Southland district.
Habitat.
This species lives in shrubland at altitudes ranging from sea-level up to subalpine.
Behaviour.
The adults of this species are on the wing from December to April.
Host species.
Larvae of this species feed on "Melicytus alpinus" and Hoare states it is likely that "Melicytus micranthus" is also a host.

Austin Irving

Austin Irving (born 1984) is an American contemporary artist and photographer.
Life.
Irving was born in New York City in 1984. She is the daughter of film director David Irving and landscape designer Susan Irving. Her paternal grandparents are theater director Jules Irving and the actor Priscilla Pointer. She is the niece of the actor Amy Irving. In 2006, Irving graduated from the Tisch School Of The Arts at NYU with a BFA from the Department of Photography and Imaging. In 2017, she was the artist-in-residence at the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bangalore, India. In 2019, she was an artist-in-residence at the Varda Artist Residency aboard the SS Vallejo, a historic house boat in Sausalito, California.
Career.
Irving works with large format analog photography. She uses a Toyo view camera and shoots on 4x5 Kodak color negative. Her images are presented as large scale photographic prints. Her photographs explore liminality and metageography, anthropocentrism, and the tension between natural and man-made environments. Irving has stated that her photographic practice is motivated by the wish to find relief from the "extreme internal discomfort" of living with body dysmorphic disorder. Irving cites Thomas Demand, Bernd &amp; Hilla Becher, MC Escher, René Magritte, Lynne Cohen, and James Turrell as artists whose work have impacted her practice.
She has been working on a photographic series entitled "NOT AN EXIT" (2007–present), which showcases real-world optical illusions created from narrow angles in functional hallways and doorways. These photographs have been called Escher-esque, a reference to M. C. Escher. The debut of this series at Wilding Cran Gallery was reviewed in The LA Times by art critic Leah Ollman.
Her series "SHOW CAVES" (2009–present) has received significant media and academic interest for its interrogation of the ethics and impact of ecotourism, specifically the concept of government and commercially operated show caves. As a result, Irving was asked to sit on a panel for a public forum on rural economies at Virginia Tech's annual conference for Appalachian Studies Association, where the socio-economic impact of commodifying rural arts, culture, environment, and heritage to create a tourist industry in rural Appalachia was debated. This series has also been featured on The Weather Channel, Yatzer, and in Wired Magazine.

Exhibitions.
Upon graduating from NYU, Irving was selected to be a part of the SoHo Photo Gallery’s 12th Annual National Photo Competition in 2007 in lower Manhattan. In 2012, Irving created a visual essay of her "SHOW CAVES" series that was projected at The Pavilion during LOOK3’s sixth annual Festival of the Photograph in Charlottesville, Virginia. LOOK3 was founded in 2006 by National Geographic photographer Michael Nichols and has been billed as "3 days of peace, love, and photography.” In 2013 and 2014, Irving’s work was included in the international shows "After Dark I" and "After Dark II", respectively, at Greg Moon Gallery in Taos, New Mexico. In 2015, "NOT AN EXIT" was featured in The Interiors Collection by SeeMe and was shown at the fifth Annual Exposure Awards at Musé du Louvre, Paris.
In 2016, Irving's photographs from her "NOT AN EXIT" series were included in the exhibition Hong Kong: Identity + Illusion at LightStage Gallery, Hong Kong. This exhibition was a "photo and interactive performance art exhibition of Hong Kong-based artists exploring individual narratives of personal identity, 'self' across time and space and cities on this incessant journey to somewhere both routine and new, and illusions of light and being as told through a camera's lens, as captured if for an instant."

Work from Irving’s "CORNERED" series was included in "The Edge Effect", an International Juried Exhibition at New York's Katonah Museum of Art juried by Akili Tommasino, Associate Curator, Modern and Contemporary Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.
In 2020 Irving was a part of the person show entitled "A Curious Horizon" at The Irvine Fine Arts Center in Southern California that “explore our perceptions of, and relationships to the world and our sense of place within it. Uncanny doorways, artificially encased exotic flora, and pastel-hued images of empty suburban spaces converge to evoke subtle and powerful statements on the precarious nature of the environments we’ve built and reshaped.”
In 2021, Irving’s work was featured in the 44th year of NIDA Meting Photography International Photography Symposium "New Boarders", in Nida, Lithuania on located on the Curonian Spit on the Baltic Sea.
Awards and nominations.
In 2014, an image from her "SHOW CAVES" series won the jury award at Gallery 110’s 4th annual juried exhibition in Seattle, Washington. In 2015 her photo series "SHOW CAVES" was a finalist in both the Architecture and Landscape categories for the Felix Schoeller Photo Award in Osnabrück, Germany. In 2016, she was a nominee for the United States Artists Fellowship. In 2019, her project "NOT AN EXIT" was awarded a gold medal at the Prix de la Photographie Paris in the Fine Arts/Architecture category while her project "PLANTS IN EXILE" was awarded gold in the Nature/Trees category. In 2019, an image from the same series was awarded third place in an international photography competition held by the New York Center for Photographic Arts. In 2019, Irving also won 1st place in the landscape category at the International Photography Grant. In 2020, her projects "SHOW CAVES" and "NOT AN EXIT" won first place at The Budapest International Foto Awards in the Science and Architecture categories.

Shahid Ashraf

Commodore Shahid Ashraf (born 1947), is a retired one-star rank admiral in the Pakistan Navy and a former spy whose role was central in a massive military scandal took place during the second administration of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
He was accused to receiving monetary corruption when he led the Naval Intelligence office under the staff of Admiral Mansurul Haq, the Chief of Naval Staff from 1994 until 1997. He was subsequently court-martial but his matter was later subjected to cover-up by the Pakistani military under the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff General Pervez Musharraf in 1999.
Biography.
Shahid Ashraf was born in 1947, and joined the Navy in 1964. He saw the military actions during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.
In 1995, Captain Ashraf was appointed to the Naval Headquarters (NHQ) and was appointed as the Hydrographer of the Navy Hydrographic Department under then-Admiral Mansurul Haq, the Chief of Naval Staff.
In 1996, Captain Ashraf was promoted to one-star rank and was subsequently appointed as the Director-General of the Naval Intelligence.
During this time, Commodore Ashraf was briefed by Naval Intelligence, led by Rear-Admiral Javed Iqbal, on the Navy receiving massive illegal financial credits from the French Navy under the auspices of Admiral Mansurul Haq. Ashraf later confronted Haq, but joined the latter when Haq subsequently pressured him, according to the official inquiry of Naval Intelligence. In 1997, Ashraf handed over command of Naval Intelligence to Rear-Admiral Tanvir Ahmed and traveled to Great Britain to attend the war course at the Royal College of Defence Studies.
In 1997, Ahmed eventually exposed the military scandal after he led the arrests of Mansurul Haq and later wound up his operation when he requested the government to recall Commodore Ashraf from his overseas studies. The Navy JAG prosecution leveled charges against Ashraf of receiving ₨. 1.5 million when he faced a court-martial at Zafar Naval base in Islamabad. In 1998, Ashraf, along with Captains Liaquat Ali Malik and Z.U. Alvi, pleaded guilty of taking the bribes and was sentenced to imprisonment for nearly seven years. However, Ashraf maintained in the court-martial that he had sought permission of leading an attempt to catch the foreign agent who was giving bribe money to naval officers, but was not allowed to do so by the NHQ.
His case findings were later subjected to a military cover-up by Chairman Joint Chiefs General Pervez Musharraf in 2000 from the inquiries of the National Accountability Bureau.
In 2010, Ashraf later blamed the outcomes of the scandals on the successive government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and senior naval officers in the NHQ, but declined to comment his role in receiving ₨. 1.5 million. He claimed that the corruption charges leveled against the Bhutto-Zardari family, were politically motivated when the Sharif family was the largest beneficiary of the Agosta submarine deals.

<doc id="56998342" url="?curid=56998342" title="Racing suit">
Racing suit

A racing suit or racing overalls, often referred to as a fire suit due to its fire retardant properties, is clothing such as overalls worn in various forms of auto racing by racing drivers, crew members who work on the vehicles during races, track safety workers or marshals, and in some series commentators at the event.
In the early days of racing, most racing series had no mandated uniforms. Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, specialized racing suits were designed to optimize driver temperature via heat transfer, and later to protect drivers from fire. By 1967, the majority of competitors in Formula One, NASCAR, the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA), United States Auto Club (USAC), and Champ Car (the predecessor to modern IndyCar) began wearing specialized fire suits. Most modern suits use Nomex, a material developed in the 1960s around the time fire suits emerged. The suits are also known for prominently displaying driver sponsors.
Design and use.
A racing suit is designed to cover the entire body of a driver, crew member, or marshall, including long sleeves and long pants legs. Typical driver suits are one-piece overalls, similar in appearance to a boilersuit. Other fire suits are two piece, consisting of a "jacket" and pants. The suits consist of a single or multiple layers of fire-retardant material. The suits also have special epaulettes or yokes on the shoulder area that act as "handles" in order to lift a driver strapped to a racing seat out of a vehicle. This is mandated under Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) safety standards.
Most suits use fabric made of Nomex, a synthetic material produced by DuPont that retains its fire-retardant properties with time and use. Other suits consist of cotton treated with Proban, a chemical manufactured by Rhodia, or other substances. These suits can lose their fire-resistant properties over time, particularly after washing. Other suits are made of Kevlar, polybenzimidazole fiber (PBI), or carbon fibers, but are less widely used due to lack of comfort and color variety. Newer suits, such as those produced by Sparco, have inner liners treated with menthol to create a cooling sensation and fight odor. Additional accessories, including fire-resistant long underwear, gloves, shoes, and balaclava-like face masks or "head socks" are also worn.
When Nomex material is exposed to flame, instead of burning or melting it develops a carbon char. The char thickens the section of fiber exposed to the flame, preventing the spread of the fire to the rest of the suit and inhibiting the transfer of heat to the wearer of the garment. CarbonX is a different fabric for fire suits made of oxidized polyacrylonitrile (a precursor to carbon fiber). It is created by heating material until it oxidizes and chars, with the finished product able to last for two minutes exposed to fire. It is frequently used for racing undergarments and gloves. Using multiple layers of the material, and quilting of the fabric, meanwhile, create pockets of air which further insulate the wearer from heat. 
The suits are not entirely fireproof, but rather fire retardant for a period of time, allowing an individual to escape an incident or be rescued with minimal injury. Bill Simpson, an innovator in racing safety, estimated in 1993 that a person has "20 to 30 seconds" before a fire suit begins to burn. The mandated minimum level of protection for uniforms in different racing series varies, as does the minimum standard for drivers, crew members, and officials. In the NHRA drag racing series, for example, suits are designed to last 30 to 40 seconds before the wearer suffers second degree burns. This is a higher benchmark than that of most other series, due to the high risk of fire from nitromethane and alcohol-fueled cars. SFI Foundation, Inc., formerly part of SEMA, dictates the suit fire protection standards for numerous sanctioning bodies particularly in the United States, including NASCAR, IndyCar, the NHRA, the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), and the United States Auto Club (USAC). The FIA determines the standards for most of its series such as Formula One and the FIA World Endurance Championship, excluding the standards of its drag racing competition which are determined by SFI. SFI and FIA standards are used by other organizations outside their jurisdiction, such as the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (CAMS).
Both SFI and the FIA use the Thermal Protective Performance (TPP) test to measure the effectiveness of fire-retardant clothing. This test, created by DuPont in the 1970s, measures the amount of time in seconds before the wearer of a garment suffers second degree burns. For example, a garment that lasts three seconds before second degree burns occur receives a TPP value of 6. Under SFI standards, this would receive a rating of 3.2A/1, the lowest possible SFI rating.
Non-fire retardant suits.
Suits in several other classes of racing are similar in appearance to fire suits, but are not designed to be fire resistant. Suits used for kart racing are not typically fire retardant, but rather are made to be abrasion resistant using leather, nylon or cordura. Suits used for motorcycle racing, called motorcycle leathers, are also designed to be abrasion resistant. They consist of leather or a similarly-strong material, with nylon and spandex fabrics prohibited. Fire-resistant undergarments are optional to provide fire protection. The Commission Internationale de Karting (CIK) and FIA regulate specifications for karting suits. The Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) regulates suits for numerous racing series such as MotoGP and the AMA Supercross Championship.
Branding.
Since the 1980s, racing suits have been customized to prominently feature the sponsors of drivers and teams, leading to designs similar to those of the race cars. For fire suits, the material used to make the sponsor patches must also be fire proof, adding additional weight to the suit. Many modern suits, however, use printed logos in order to reduce weight.
History.
Prior to the advent of fire-retardant racing suits, there were no mandated driving uniforms in most racing series. In NASCAR competition, for example, many drivers and crew members would wear jeans and other typical street clothes. American firm Hinchman had manufactured specialized racing suits since the mid-1920s, worn by drivers Babe Stapp and Pete DePaolo. In the 1950s, NASCAR Grand National (NASCAR Cup Series) driver Tim Flock began wearing a specialized racing suit, which became popular in the 1960s. At this time, the suits were designed with an inner liner meant to keep drivers cool. Soon afterwards, in several series racing suits or any driver clothing used in competition were soaked in chemical solutions to make them fire-retardant long enough for a driver to escape an incident. In NASCAR, a baking soda solution was typically used, while the SCCA mandated racing suits treated in boric acid or borax. Boraxo, a brand of powdered soap largely composed of borax, was often used as treatment.
The catalyst for developing racing suits that could effectively resist fire came in the late 1950s and 1960s, when several fiery crashes occurred in the motorsport world. In 1959, Jerry Unser died from burns suffered in a crash practicing for the Indianapolis 500. In 1963, NHRA Top Fuel driver and Division 7 Tech Director Chuck Branham died after suffering burns in a crash. During NASCAR's 1964 World 600 (today's Coca-Cola 600), Fireball Roberts was involved in a crash on lap seven while avoiding two other cars, passing away five weeks later. Roberts had asthmatic reactions to the clothing treatment used by NASCAR, and had received a waver against using it. One week later during the 1964 Indianapolis 500, drivers Dave MacDonald and Eddie Sachs were killed in a seven-car crash on the second lap of the race.
Following the incidents, Jim Deist and Bill Simpson, who developed some of the first drag parachutes, released the first racing suits designed to be fire-retardant. Both suits were "aluminized" in order to be flame resistant. Simpson's suit consisted of a modified cotton boilersuit. In 1959 after the death of Unser, all Indy 500 competitors were required to wear fire-retardant clothing. In 1963, the FIA assumed responsibility for driver safety in its series, and mandated fire-retardant suits for Formula One drivers. In 1964, the NHRA mandated fire suits for its competitors. By the fall of that year after Roberts' crash, nearly all NASCAR competitors began wearing fire suits, although no official rule was in place.
In 1966, Simpson met NASA astronaut Pete Conrad, who introduced Simpson to the Nomex material used in spacesuits for the Apollo program. Around the same time, DuPont also approached the Hinchman company about producing Nomex racing suits. In that year's Indianapolis 500, driver Mel Kenyon wore a Nomex fire suit produced by Hinchman. Later that year, several drivers began testing experimental Nomex suits for Simpson, including F1 drivers Walt Hansgen and Masten Gregory, NASCAR driver Marvin Panch, and SCCA Trans-Am Series driver Bob Tullius. Simpson's company Simpson Performance Products released the first commercial Nomex racing suit, called the "Heat Shield Firesuit", in 1967. The suits were worn by 30 of 33 competitors in the 1967 Indianapolis 500.
By 1970, the NHRA along with SEMA began developing specifications for fire suits, using the Thermal Protective Performance (TPP) standard developed by DuPont. These specifications are now used by SFI. During the 1970s, racewear manufacturer Stand 21 partnered with brake manufacturer Ferodo and a french producer of firemen's suits to create single-layer asbestos racing uniforms. These suits never became popular, as the dangers of asbestos exposure became more well-known. Actor Steve McQueen was believed to have worn asbestos suits when performing stunts for films, which may have contributed to his contraction of mesothelioma. In 1975, the FIA introduced its current standard for fire-retardant suits. At this time, DuPont created a new Nomex blend using Kevlar to prevent tearing and increase the longevity of suits. In 1979, several F1 drivers including Niki Lauda, Mario Andretti, and Carlos Reutemann began competing in bulky five-layer suits constructed to NASA specifications.
In the mid-1980s, companies began designing fire suits to prominently display team sponsors. In 1986, the FIA introduced new specifications for fire suits, known as "FIA 1986" certification. At the 1989 Motorcraft Quality Parts 500 NASCAR event, ESPN/ABC broadcaster Dr. Jerry Punch was reporting from the pit stall of Richard Petty when a fire broke out, injuring two crew members who Punch proceeded to treat on the spot. Following the incident, in which several items of Punch's clothing were singed or melted, ESPN mandated that its pit reporters wear fire-retardant suits. Other networks have since adopted the practice.
In 1994, the FIA mandated fire suits for F1 pit crew members, coinciding with refueling being allowed (until 2009) during pit stops. By this time, crews in IndyCar were also required to wear fire suits. In 2002, NASCAR officially mandated fire suits for both drivers and crew members servicing the car during pit stops. This was in response to non-fire-related incidents in the previous season, including the death of Dale Earnhardt at the beginning of 2001, and a pit road accident at the Pennzoil Freedom 400 near the end of the season. NASCAR was one of the last major sanctioning bodies to mandate fire suits for crew members.
In other media.
The members of the Red Star crew in the 2000 film "Charlie's Angels" wore black Momo Corse Torino firesuits. The racing suits in "Charlie's Angels" were designed by Joseph G. Aulisi.

Olive Downs Station

Olive Downs Station is one of 7 former cattle stations in Sturt National Park in the north western Corner of New South Wales.
History.
The station is on the traditional lands of the Yarli people.
The first Europeans to the area were Charles Sturt and then Bourke and Wills.
The push for sheep pasture had reached the Darling River in the late 1840s and early 1850s, and by the early to mid-1860s pastoralists were moving up the Warrego and Paroo rivers. By the late 1870s most of north-west New South Wales had been ‘claimed’ as pastoral properties though access to permanent water in the more arid country continued to be the key factor for establishing sheep stations... The discovery of the Great Artesian Basin led to sinking of artesian bores and the beginnings of a major travelling stock route in 1884.
Olive Downs Station was established between 1884 and 1886 but the actual date is uncertain. It was 92,000 acres and the first recorded owners were Charles Murray and William Sanderson in 1889. The property changed hands a number of times and grew in area to become 512,000 acres in 1912 and even larger with the addition of an adjoining property in Queensland sometime before 1924. In 1924 or 1927 it became part of Sidney Kidman’s pastoral empire. It has been said that Kidman controlled a third of the West Darling region by 1920 (Stanley 1991 cited in Peter Freeman Pty Ltd 2004). Olive Downs Station ran huge flocks of sheep in its early days but by 1927–1932 these were dramatically reduced to an average of 12,172 head of sheep.

Mount Wood Station

The Mount Wood Station, also known as simply Mt Wood, is a heritage-listed former cattle station that now forms part of the Sturt National Park in Tibooburra in the Unincorporated Far West region of New South Wales, Australia. The cattle station was built between 1890 and 1969. As a national park, the property is owned by the NSW Officer of Environment and Heritage, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.
Mount Wood Station is east of Tibooburra, New South Wales, and gives its name to the Parish of Mount Wood.
History.
Expeditions were made through the area in Australia's early history. These included Charles Sturt (1847-48), who undertook an expedition into central Australia during which the party was stranded for several months at both Fort Grey and Depot Glenn (near Milparinka); and Burke and Wills (1860-61), in which this expedition passed northwards through the eastern section of the national park (probably Mount Wood.
Description.
Mount Wood Homestead complex is today within Sturt National Park. The national park is representative of the shrub rangeland in western New South Wales, it provides one of the best examples of this land type in conjunction with wattle ("Acacia" spp.) dominated fluviatile and aeolian land types. The area, due to its size, is an important wildlife refuge, and has a significant species diversity including 246 native species, as well as a high diversity of landforms including Aeolian dune systems, Mitchell Grass Plains, the Jump Ups and Gibber Desert.
The national park lies in the south-west of a vast bowl shaped depression which covers eastern central Australia, and is mainly covered by low undulating plains of Gibber Desert in the east or sand dunes in the west except for where it contains the south-western end of the Grey Range. Here the Jump Ups, a range of low flat topped hills (mesa) run through the centre of the park and along its eastern boundary. Just inside the park boundary at Tibooburra is a granite outcrop which has formations of hilltop tors. The southern extremity of the Grey Range in the north of the park has associated mesa formations and eroded gullies, the remainder of the park has the occasional stony hill and many drainage basins.
The park has three major vegetation associations, these include a mulga association; saltbush association; and bluebush association.
Complex features.
The Mount Wood Homestead complex comprises:
The garden comprises a line of eucalypts behind the kitchen and laundry/store; two trees to the right hand side (in plan) of the 1897 homestead; two paths linking the two homesteads (1897, 1935); a drift of three eucalypts in front of the 1935 homestead; a pepper tree ("Schinus molle") near the stone hut () and poultry runs; regrowth vegetation to the left (in plan) of the radio aerial and poultry runs; and horse yards, from the 1960s.
The homestead is in fact two homesteads connected via a covered link between the 1897 homestead that is stone, square, with a verandah all around, and the second homestead. The homestead retains elements from each stage of its history in archaeological or standing form. Its important documents of the long history of station operations, and a potential research resource in terms of its archaeological values.
Located south-east of the homestead complex and north of Thomson's Creek, this is a complex of three structures that includes the shearer's quarters (1955); a kitchen; and other unidentified structure. The shearers quarters retains elements from each stage of its history in archaeological or standing form. Its important documents of the long history of station operations, and a potential research resource in terms of its archaeological values.
Located south-east of the homestead complex across (south of) Thomson's Creek near the suspension bridge.
The woolscour has been well researched, and is still the only 19th century station-based scour demonstrated to have survived largely intact. While comparative research is still patchy, the Mount Wood woolscour appears to be a rare survival of a once common pastoral technology, critical to the settlement of the pastoral frontier.
s shed on a concrete slab and pier foundation, supported by round painted steel pipe posts with dooden rafters and battens, clad in painted corrugated iron. The shed is roughly long, deep and high. Wooden roof support structure (battens and beams).
Other structures include outstations, archaeological sites, ruins that include shed base (beside the vehicle shed); former approach track (towards garden and homestead); tank base (near generator shed); standing structures include, in a cluster around the stables, gallows (1960s); dog kennels (); horse yards (1960s); cow bail; stables (1960s); generator shed (1955); fuel shed (1955); metal racks; g.i.tank; blacksmith's shop and workshop (); pump (1930s); and vehicle shed. In a cluster around the homestead there is a laundry and store (1958); kitchen (1939); meat house; saddle room; stone cistern (1897); station tanks (4); galvanised iron fence; stone hut (); poultry runs; radio aerial. To the left of the homestead and stables complex (in plan), site of radio aerial arrays.
The individual elements vary in age, but even the most recent are located upon traditional sites of pastoral operations, and an unusually complete representative sample of the elements typical of pastoral stations survives, as archaeological sites, ruins, standing structures or landscape features.
Heritage listing.
As at 11 January 2002, Mount Wood Homestead complex, shearers quarters, woolshed, woolscours and outstations are significant in that they demonstrate a continuity of pastoral activity in the arid north-west of NSW over a one hundred year period. The individual elements vary in age, but even the most recent are located upon traditional sites of pastoral operations, and an unusually complete representative sample of the elements typical of pastoral stations survives, as archaeological sites, ruins, standing structures or landscape features. The extant evidence clearly illustrates the themes of housing, isolation, land tenure/settlement, pastoralism and technology. Some elements of the place are significant in their own right.
The woolscour has been well researched, and is still the only 19th century station-based scour demonstrated to have survived largely intact. While comparative research is still patchy, the Mount Wood woolscour appears to be a rare survival of a once common pastoral technology, critical to the settlement of the pastoral frontier.
The shearers quarters and homestead retain elements from each stage of their history in archaeological or standing form. They are both important documents of the long history of station operations, and a potential research resource in terms of their archaeological values. Individual elements have aesthetic (architectural) and scientific (archaeological and technological) values.
The survival of the range of elements present at Mount Wood is believed to be already uncommon in western NSW, and may become increasingly rare as time passes.
Mount Wood Station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Aleksandra Akimova

Aleksandra Akimova (; 5 May 1922 – 29 December 2012) was a squadron navigator in the 46th Taman Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment during the Second World War. In 1994 she became one of the few women awarded the title Hero of the Russian Federation.
Early life.
Akimova was born on 5 May 1922 to a Russian peasant family in the village of Skopinsky within the Ryazan Governorate of the Russian SFSR. After graduating from secondary school she entered history classes at the Moscow Pedagogical Institute in addition to nursing courses. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 she applied to enlist in the Red Army but her request was initially denied and she was sent to assist in construction of defensive fortifications around Mozhaysk.
Military career.
Eventually accepted into the military in October 1941, she attended an accelerated navigation course at Engels Military Aviation School in Saratov; upon graduating from the training in February 1942 she was assigned to the 588th Night Bomber Aviation Regiment, with which she was deployed to the warfront in May. Despite being trained as a navigator, she originally worked as a master of armament and later aircraft mechanic. Not satisfied with being confined to a ground crew role, Akimova asked to become a navigator for combat missions when the regiment began forming a third squadron in February 1943 after receiving the guards designation; the process of forming the new squadron included training mechanics as navigators and navigators as pilots. Her request was accepted, and after quickly completing additional navigation training she flew her first sortie as navigator in April 1943, making her one of the youngest navigators in the regiment. Despite her minimal experience as a military navigator, she nevertheless excelled in the position, and was soon promoted to the position of squadron navigator in October 1943. In addition, she helped train seven new navigators, which was not made easy by conditions on the warfront. By the end of the war Akimova made 680 combat sorties as navigator on a Po-2 biplane, for which she was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union in May 1945, but the nominated was demoted to only the Order of Lenin.
Later life.
After the end of the war Akimova was demobilized from the military in October 1945 and she soon returned to her studies at the Moscow Pedagogical Institute. In 1952 she began teaching at the Moscow Aviation Institute, where she taught for 40 years until her retirement in 1992.
In 1994 she was awarded the title Hero of the Russian Federation for her actions in the war after her participation in the war gained attention. She was an active member of the veterans movement and participated in victory parades. She passed away on 29 December 2012 and was buried in the Troyekurovsky cemetery in Moscow.

Amateur career.
Kang began playing baseball in elementary school but had to move between schools several times as a youth due to "a family issue" which he told "Ilgan Sports" was "hard to talk about."
Kang played high school baseball as a pitcher, catcher and designated hitter at Seoul High School where, as a freshman, he was the first player to hit a home run at Gocheok Sky Dome. In 2017, he led Seoul to a high school baseball championship and was named the most valuable player of the tournament. Kang's accomplishments as a high schooler brought him significant media attention. After high school, Kang decided to enter the KBO against the wishes of his father who wanted him to try for "a bigger stage."
Professional career.
Kang was selected with the first overall pick in the 2017 KBO draft by the KT Wiz. He made his KBO debut at 18 years old and hit a home run against Héctor Noesí in the first plate appearance of his career. As a professional, he stopped pitching and catching and transitioned to the field. Kang set the rookie record with 29 home runs en route to winning the KBO League Rookie of the Year Award. He pitched in the 2018 KBO All-Star Game and reached speeds of . Following the season, his salary was more than tripled to ₩120 million (equivalent to $ in 2019), setting a record for a sophomore player.
In June 2019, Kang underwent surgery on his hand after cutting it on a piece of metal while making a catch in foul territory at Busan Sajik Baseball Stadium. He sat out for the entire month of July due to the injury but was voted a starter on the all-star team nonetheless.
Kang missed three weeks of the 2020 season after hurting his wrist while sliding on defense. Fans voted Kang to the all-star team again in 2020 although the game did not take place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
At the halfway point of the 2021 season, Kang had a batting average of .395 which led the league by 47 points.
International career.

Let's Talk About Me

Let's Talk About Me is a 1995 girl-oriented activity centre video game developed by GirlGames Inc. and team smartyPants!, and published by Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive. It was released on Macintosh, Windows, and Windows 3.x. A sequel entitled Let's Talk About Me Too was released in 1997.
Development.
Some of the proto girl's games were "Jenny of the Prairie", "Cave Girl Clair", "Kirsten and her Family", and "Sara and her Friends" in the 1980s. In 1995, software designer Lara Groppe continued this trend by researching girl's use of computers; she found they used them for shorter bursts and preferred content that was educational as well as entertaining. As a result, she founded the company GirlGames in 1993 and created "Let's Talk About Me" as its debut title.
Heather Kelley was hired in October 1995 as the company moved from Houston to Texas; her role was to do research for the game. Groppe has apparently shown her resume to her mum, who said on the spot "hire her". She split her time between working on the game and on the website.
Development was unusual in the sense that the target market directly provided input in shaping the product rather than playtesting it upon completion. Success of market leaders such as this title, Purple Moon, Her Interactive, and Girl Tech would all be founded in 1997.
Gameplay.
With no plot to speak of, the game plays as an activity center for 10-14-year-old girls, with both quizzes and minigames that explore themes such as horoscopes and fashion. The game was specifically designed for girls and as such there is no combat and most of the games have no right or wrong answers. The game consists of four sections entitled "My Personality," "My Body," "My Life," and "My Future", which excluding the last one that is based on conjecture mix educational content with fun gameplay. One such game explores the "perils of puberty". The sequel features sections entitled My Diary, My Hairmaster Deluxe, My Zodiac Zone, and My Personality.
SuperKids described it as an "interactive, multimedia version of Young Miss magazine".
Critical reception.
SuperKids felt the game offered a reason to get girls interested in using the computer, which was deemed a positive due to girls lagging behind boys when it came to PC use. Millennium Girls: Today's Girls Around the World felt it was a slow, girl-gendered counterpart to the "twitch" games that appealed to boys. New Trends in Software Methodologies, Tools and Techniques felt the games were excellent programs for teenage girls.
In its first eight months on the market, the game sold half a million copies. Critical Readings: Media And Gender felt the game's success in the marketplace offered proof that young woman were a viable target market for video gaming.

Popular Unity (Montenegro)

Popular Unity (Montenegrin and ) was an big tent opposition political alliance in Montenegro. The alliance was formed by two major opposition parties in Montenegro at time, the People's Party (NS) and Liberal Alliance of Montenegro (LSCG), prior to the 1996 parliamentary election. Slavko Perović's idea for the alliance was that it would open the way for "reconciliation between Montenegrins and Montenegrin Serbs". Kilibarda's party was Serbian nationalist. The main goal of the alliance was to overthrow the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) of president Momir Bulatović, which has been in power since introduction of multi-party system. The coalition of liberals and populists won 24.91% of votes and gained only 19 MPs, 11 of which belonged to NS and 8 to LSCG. However, LSCG terminated the coalition after the decision of NS to enter into coalition with the ruling DPS.

Nirmāṇakāya

Nirmāṇakāya (, ) is the third aspect of the trikāya and the physical manifestation of a Buddha in time and space. In Vajrayāna it is described as "the dimension of ceaseless manifestation."
Emanation body in Buddhism.
Indian Buddhism.
One early Buddhist text, the Pali "Samaññaphala Sutta", lists the ability to create a “mind-made body” ("manomāyakāya") as one of the "fruits of the contemplative life". Commentarial texts such as the "Patisambhidamagga" and the "Visuddhimagga" state that this mind-made body is how Gautama Buddha and arhats are able to travel into heavenly realms using the continuum of the mindstream ("cittasaṃtāna") and it is also used to explain the multiplication miracle of the Buddha as illustrated in the "Divyavadana", in which the Buddha multiplied his "nirmita" or emanated human form into countless other bodies which filled the sky. A Buddha or other realized being is able to project many such nirmitas simultaneously in an infinite variety of forms in different realms simultaneously.
The Indian Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu (fl. 4th to 5th century CE) defined "nirmita" as a siddhi or psychic power (Pali "iddhi", Sanskrit: "ṛddhi") developed through Buddhist discipline, concentrated discipline ("samadhi") and wisdom in his seminal work on Buddhist philosophy, the "Abhidharmakośakārikā". Asanga's "Bodhisattvabhūmi" defines nirmāṇa as a magical illusion and "basically, something without a material basis." The Madhyamaka school of philosophy sees all reality as empty of essence; all reality is seen as a form of nirmita or magical illusion.

Back to Me (Marian Hill and Lauren Jauregui song)

"Back to Me" is a song recorded by American electronic duo Marian Hill and American singer and songwriter Lauren Jauregui. It was released on December 8, 2016 and included on the duo's extended debut album "Act One: The Complete Collection". The song was written by the members of Marian Hill (Samantha Gongol and Jeremy Lloyd) and Jauregui, and produced by Lloyd. It is Jauregui's first release outside of Fifth Harmony.
Production.
Marian Hill and Jauregui said that the song began with the two of them on a plane and Jauregui in a hotel room, and the track was recorded in producer Jeremy's bedroom. Gongol commented that the duo and Jauregui had been wanting to work together since they met at one of Marian Hill's shows over a year earlier, and they managed to complete the song with her in a brief period she had outside her tight schedule with Fifth Harmony. Lloyd said that Jauregui told them she had already written her verse about five minutes before she was going to record it, and she "nailed the rhyme scheme and did so probably quicker and more deftly than we could have done". Lloyd also complimented the harmonies Jauregui wrote, saying that she has "an amazing harmonic ear".
Critical reception.
"Back to Me" was called a highlight from "Act One" by "Idolator". "The AU Review" named it "Single of the Day", calling it "sexy and icy at the same time" and complimenting its "bluesy groove". For "The Fader", Marian Hill's Samantha Gongol and Jauregui's voices "play really nicely off of each other". Emilee Lindner of Fuse wrote that "Jauregui's smooth, husky voice finds a home on the trippy, hip-hop-tinged song". The Inquisitr's Clare Mulligan described the song as "woozy and minimalist, with a hypnotic background beat and a chanted chorus." "Time" magazine's Raisa Brunner recommended the song, writing that it "plays with negative space" and praising and Lloyd's "sharp" production and Gongol and Jauregui's voices.
Live performances.
Marian Hill and Jauregui first performed the track live in December 2016 at the SnowGlobe Festival in South Lake Tahoe, California.

The 2018 Utah State Aggies football team represented Utah State University in the 2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Aggies were led by sixth-year head coach Matt Wells during the regular season and played their home games at Merlin Olsen Field at Maverik Stadium. They competed as members of the Mountain Division of the Mountain West Conference. They finished the season 11–2, 7–1 in Mountain West play to finish in a tie for first place in the division with Boise State. Despite the tie, the conference does not credit them as divisional co-champions as a result of the head-to-head loss. They were invited to the New Mexico Bowl where they defeated North Texas. The 11 wins tied a school record.
Head coach Matt Wells was hired by Texas Tech on November 29; the team was led in the New Mexico Bowl by interim head coach and co-defensive
coordinator Frank Maile. Wells finished with a 44–34 record in his six seasons at Utah State. On December 9, the school rehired Gary Andersen, six years after he left for Wisconsin.

Clyde Short

Clyde Lorraine Short (January 30, 1883 – February 27, 1936) was a Democratic politician from the U.S. state of Kansas, best known as a former two-time candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives and the Chairman of the Kansas Democratic Party from 1934 to 1936.
Biography.
Short was born in Rochester, Indiana in 1883. He grew up in Concordia, Kansas, where, as a youth, he became known for his public speaking skill. Upon graduation, he read law in the offices of Pulsiver and Alexander, passed the bar in 1916, and was eventually elected Concordia City Attorney. He was a Democratic candidate for the U. S. House of Representatives for Kansas, in 1930, against incumbent James G. Strong, who narrowly defeated Short in a close race. He ran again in 1932, and was defeated in the Democratic primary by Kathryn O'Loughlin McCarthy, who would go on to become the first female U. S. Representative from Kansas. Despite these setbacks, he remained active in the Democratic party, and was elected Party Chairman in 1934, directing the effort to unseat incumbent Governor Alf Landon. Although Landon won re-election, Short presided over two first-time Democratic victories in Kansas, the offices of State Auditor and State Superintendent of Public Instruction.
Short died in 1936, of pneumonia. His brother was American baseball player Harry Short.

Cudlee Creek Conservation Park

 
Cudlee Creek Conservation Park (formerly Cudlee Creek National Park Reserve) is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Cudlee Creek in the Adelaide Hills state government region about south-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about south-west of the town centre in Gumeracha.
The conservation park consists of land in section 57 in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Talunga which is bounded to the east by Gorge Road and in part by the Torrens River whose watercourse is located within the conservation park's boundaries at times.
It was proclaimed on 29 April 1971 as the "Cudlee Creek National Parks Reserve" under the National Parks Act 1966. It was reconstituted on 27 April 1972 as the " Cudlee Creek Conservation Park" upon the proclamation of the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972". As of 2016, it covered an area of .
In 1980, it was described as follows:A small park with open forest representative of the Adelaide hills region and containing excellent bird habitat. The River Torrens flows through a portion of the park, where native hydrophyllic species are preserved. … consisting of a steep hillside clothed with "Eucalyptus obliqua" / "E. goniocalyx" / "E. viminalis" open forest over an understorey of "Pteridium esculentum". On the lower slopes and along the river course "E. camaldulensis" open forest over "Acacia melanoxylon" and "Banksia marginata" occur. The steep slopes are in disturbed natural condition but the lower slopes and riverbank are dominated by an understorey of blackberry ("Rubus" sp.) and some gorse ("Ulex europaeus").
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

Jane Placide

Jane Placide (1804 – May 16, 1835) was an American actress.
Life.
Jane's parents had immigrated to the United States in 1792. She was the daughter of Alexander Placide, manager of the Charleston Theatre in Charleston, and the actress and opera singer Charlotte Wrighten Placide, who managed the same theatre after the death of her spouse until 1813, when the family lost the theatre. 
Placide had three siblings; Caroline, Henry and Thomas. All four children became well-known actors, however, it's unclear which stage name they later used.
Career.
Jane Placide and her siblings where all schooled into the acting profession from an early age in their parents theater company, who performed both in the Charleston Theatre as well as toured around Virginia and the Carolina states. She made her formal debut as an actor as Volante in 'The Honey Moon' in the Virginia Company of Charles Gilfert in Norfolk, Virginia in 1820.
Placide was engaged by James H. Caldwell in his American Company at the American Theatre on Orleans Street in New Orleans, where she made her debut in 1823. Caldwell's American Company was the first permanent English language theatre in New Orleans, and Jane Placide was to become the most celebrated actress in New Orleans. She was engaged at the Camp Street Theatre (also called 'American Theatre') from 1824, when Caldwell founded that theatre. During her period of employ, the Camp Street Theatre was called the finest theatre in the South, and Placide was consequently famed in the entire Antebellum South. 
She mainly starred in Shakespearean roles, such as Ophelia, Desdemona and Juliet, but she also acted in comedies, such as Mrs Candour in 'The School for Scandal', and melod drama, such as Mrs Haller i 'The Stranger' by Benjamin Thompson. 
One of her most celebrated parts was when she appeared at James H. Caldwell's American Theatre in James H. Kennicott's romantic tragedy "Irma"; or "The Prediction" in 1830.
She acted with many of the most famed actors of the American stage, such as Thomas Abthorpe Cooper, Junius Brutus Booth and Edwin Forrest. In 1834, she accompanied James H. Caldwell to London, where she made her debut at the Covent Garden Theatre.
Placide never married, but had a long term relationship with James H. Caldwell. Edwin Forrest was reportedly also in love with Placide, and supposedly challenged Caldwell to a duel, which never happened.
Death.
Placide was buried at the Girod Cemetery originally. The cemetery was eventually disbanded and her remains were reburied at the Hope Mausoleum.

East German balloon escape

In the East German balloon escape in 1979, two families, with eight members in total, escaped the Eastern bloc country of East Germany by crossing the border to West Germany in a homemade hot air balloon. The escape happened at approximately 2:00 a.m. on 16 September 1979. The plot to accomplish this was carried out over a period of one and a half years, including an unsuccessful attempt, three different balloons, and various modifications until the successful escape occurred. One failed crossing alerted the government to the plot, but the police were not able to identify the suspects before their flight to the west.
Background.
The Eastern bloc country of East Germany was separated from West Germany by the Inner German border and the Berlin Wall, which were heavily fortified with watchtowers, land mines, armed soldiers, and various other measures to prevent its citizens from escaping to the West. The East German border patrols were instructed by standing order to prevent border penetration by all means including lethal force (Schießbefehl ("order to fire")).
Peter Strelzyk (1942–2017), an electrician and former East German Air Force mechanic, and Günter Wetzel (born 1955), a bricklayer by trade, were colleagues at a local plastics factory who had been friends for four years. They shared a desire to flee the country and began discussing ways to cross the border. On 7 March 1978, they agreed to work to plan an escape. They considered building a helicopter but quickly realized they would not be able to acquire an engine capable of powering such a craft. Next, they decided to investigate the idea of constructing a hot air balloon, having been inspired by a television program about ballooning. An alternate account is that they were given a magazine article about the International Balloon Festival in Albuquerque, New Mexico, by a relative.
Construction.
The pair began research into balloons. Their plan was to escape with their wives and total of four children (aged 2 to 15). They calculated the weight of the passengers and the craft itself to be around . Subsequent calculations determined a balloon capable of lifting this weight would need to hold of air heated to . The next calculation was the amount of material needed for the balloon, estimated at .
The pair lived in Pößneck, a small town of about 20,000 where large quantities of cloth would not be available without raising attention. They tried neighbouring towns of Rudolstadt, Saalfeld, and Jena without success. They travelled to Gera where they purchased rolls of cotton cloth totalling in length at a department store after telling the astonished clerk that they needed the large quantity of material to use as tent lining for their camping club.
Wetzel spent two weeks sewing the cloth into a balloon-shaped bag, wide by long, on a 40-year-old manually-operated sewing machine. Strelzyk spent the time building the gondola and burner assembly. The gondola was made from an iron frame, sheet metal floor, and clothesline run around the perimeter every for the sides. The burner was made using two bottles of liquid propane household gas, hoses, water pipe, a nozzle, and a piece of stove pipe.
First test.
The team was ready to test the craft in April 1978. After days of searching, they found a suitable secluded forest clearing near Ziegenrück, from the border and from Pößneck. After lighting the burner one night, they failed to inflate the balloon. They thought the problem could be that they laid the balloon out on the ground. After weeks of additional searching, they found a cliff at a rock quarry where they could suspend the balloon vertically before inflation but that was also unsuccessful.
Next they decided to fill the bag first with air at ambient temperature before using the burner to raise the air temperature to provide lift. They constructed a blower with a 14 hp motorcycle engine, started with a Trabant automobile starter powered by jumper cables from Strelzyk's Moskvitch sedan. This engine, quieted by a Trabant muffler, turned fan blades to inflate the balloon. They also used a home-made flamethrower, similar to the gondola's burner, to pre-heat the air faster. With these modifications in place, they returned to the secluded clearing to try again but could still not inflate the balloon. Using the blower did allow them to discover that the cotton material with which they fashioned the balloon was too porous and leaked massively.
Their unsuccessful effort cost them 2,400 DDM. Strelzyk disposed of the cloth by burning it in his furnace over several weeks.
Second test.
The pair purchased samples of different fabrics in local stores, including umbrella material and various samples of taffeta and nylon. They used an oven to test the material for heat resistance and created a test rig from a vacuum cleaner and a water-filled glass tube to determine which material would allow the vacuum to exert the most suction on the water. This would reveal which material was densest. The umbrella covering performed the best but was also the most expensive. They instead selected a synthetic kind of taffeta.
To purchase a large quantity of fabric without arousing too much suspicion, they again drove to a distant city. This time they travelled over to a department store in Leipzig. Their cover story this time was that they were in a sailing club and needed the material to make sails. The quantity they needed had to be ordered, and although they feared the purchase might have been reported to East Germany's State Security Service (Stasi), they returned the next day and picked up the material without incident. They paid 4,800 DDM () for of fabric. On the way home, they also purchased an electric motor to speed up the pedal-operated sewing machine they had been using to sew the material into the desired balloon shape.
Wetzel spent the next week sewing the material into another balloon, accomplishing the task faster the second time with the now-electric sewing machine. Soon after, they returned to the forest clearing and had the bag inflated in about five minutes using the blower and flame thrower. The bag arose and held air, but the burner on the gondola was not powerful enough to create the heat needed for lift. They continued experimenting for months, doubling the number of propane tanks and trying different mixtures of fuels. Disappointed with the result, Wetzel decided to abandon the project and instead started to pursue the idea of building a small gasoline engine-powered light aeroplane or a glider.
Strelzyk continued trying to improve the burner. In June 1979, he discovered that with the propane tank inverted, additional pressure caused the liquid propane to gasify which would create a bigger flame. He modified the gondola to mount the propane tanks upside down, and returned to the test site where he found the new configuration produced a long flame. Strelzyk was ready to attempt an escape.
First escape attempt.
On 3 July 1979, the weather and wind conditions were favourable. The entire Strelzyk family lifted from a forest clearing at 1:30 am and climbed at a rate of per second. They reached an altitude of according to an altimeter Strelzyk had made by modifying a barometer. A moderate wind was blowing them towards the border and freedom in West Germany. The balloon entered a cloud, atmospheric water vapour condensed on the balloon and the added weight of the water caused the balloon to descend. They landed safely approximately from the border at the edge of the heavily mined border zone. Unsure of where they were, Strelzyk explored until he found a piece of litter – a bread bag from a bakery in Wernigerode, an East German town. The family spent nine hours carefully extricating themselves from the wide border zone to avoid detection. They also had to travel unnoticed through a restricted zone before hiking back a total of to their car and all the launch paraphernalia they left there. They made it home just in time to report absent due to sickness from work and school.
The balloon was left where it landed and discovered later that morning. Strelzyk destroyed everything remaining and sold his car fearing that could connect him to the balloon. On 14 August 1979, the Stasi advertised for help finding the "perpetrator of a serious offence" and listed in detail all the items left at the crash site. He felt that the Stasi would eventually trace the balloon to him and the Wetzels. Strelzyk conferred with Wetzel and they agreed their best chance was to quickly build another balloon and get out as soon as possible.
Successful escape.
The pair decided to double the balloon's size to in volume, in diameter, and in height. They needed of taffeta, and purchased the material, in various colours and patterns, all over the country to escape suspicion. Wetzel sewed a third balloon, using over of thread and Strelzyk rebuilt everything else as before. They were ready in six weeks with a balloon, and a payload of , including the gondola, equipment, and cargo (the two families). Confident in their calculations, they found weather conditions right on 15 September when a violent thunderstorm created the correct winds and set off for the launch site in Strelzyk's replacement car (a Wartburg) and a moped. Arriving at 1:30 am, they needed just ten minutes to inflate the balloon and an additional three minutes to heat the air.
They lifted off just after 2:00 am and, due to not cutting the tethers holding the gondola to the ground synchronously, it tilted sending the flame towards the fabric which caught fire. After the fire was put out with an extinguisher they had brought for just such an emergency, the balloon climbed to in nine minutes, drifting towards West Germany at . They flew for 28 minutes, with the temperature at and no shelter as the gondola was just a railing of clothesline. A design miscalculation resulted in the burner stovepipe being too long, causing the flame to be too high in the balloon creating excessive pressure which caused the balloon to split. Air rushing out of the split extinguished the burner flame. Wetzel was able to re-light the flame with a match and had to do so several more times before they landed. At one point, they increased the flame to the maximum possible and rose to . They later learned they had been high enough to be detected, but not identified, on radar by West German air traffic controllers. They had also been detected on the East German side by a night watchman at the district culture house in Bad Lobenstein. The report of an unidentified flying object heading toward the border caused guards to activate search lights, but the balloon was too high and out of reach of the lights.
The tear in the balloon meant they had to use the burner much more often and the distance they could travel was greatly limited. Wetzel later said he thought they could have travelled another had the balloon remained intact. They made out the border crossing at Rudolphstein on the A9 and saw the search lights. When the propane ran out they descended quickly, landing near the town of Naila, in the West German state of Bavaria and only from the border. The only injury was suffered by Wetzel, who broke his leg upon landing. They thought they had made it as they had seen red and yellow coloured lights which were not common in East Germany. They also saw small farms, different from the large state-run operations in the east. Another clue was modern farm equipment that was unlike older equipment that was used in East Germany. Two Bavarian State Police officers saw the balloon's flickering light and headed to where they thought it would land and found Strelzyk and Wetzel who first asked if they had made it to the west, although they noticed the police car was an Audi – another sign they were in West Germany. Upon learning they had, they happily called for their families to join them.
Aftermath.
The families decided to initially settle in Naila where they landed. Wetzel worked as an automobile mechanic and Strelzyk opened a TV repair shop in Bad Kissingen. Owing to pressure on them from Stasi spies, the Strelzyks moved to Switzerland in 1985. After the German reunification in 1990, they returned to their hometown of Pößneck and to their old home there. The Wetzels remained in Bavaria.
The West German weekly magazine "Stern" paid Strelzyk and Wetzel for exclusive rights to the story.
East Germany immediately increased border security, closed all small airports close to the border, and ordered the planes kept farther inland. Propane gas tanks became registered products and large quantities of fabric suitable for balloon construction could no longer be purchased. Mail from East Germany to the families was prohibited.
Erich Strelzyk learned of his brother's escape on the ZDF news and was arrested three hours after the landing in his Potsdam apartment. The arrest of family members was standard procedure to deter others from attempting escape. He was charged with "aiding and abetting escape" as were Strelzyk's sister Maria and her husband who were sentenced to years. The three were eventually released with the help of Amnesty International.
The escape has been portrayed in two films: "Night Crossing" (1982) and "Balloon" (2018). The former, also called "With the Wind to the West" – the English translation of the German title, was an English-language film produced by Disney. The Strelzyks were reportedly "moved to tears" at the screening of the movie at Rockefeller Center in New York City. The latter was a German-language production which "both families welcomed [Director] Herbig’s desire to, as he put it, 'make a German film for an international audience.'" Herbig said in 2018 that both the Strelzeyk and Wetzel families were dissatisfied with the Disney film.
Peter Strelzyk died in 2017 at age 74 after a long illness.
In 2017, the balloon was put on permanent exhibition at the , Bavaria.

Maci (1652–1739) was a Manchu court official who lived in the Qing dynasty. He was from the Fuca clan, and was the eldest son of Mishan (米思翰). 
Maci served as Ministry of War from 1691 to 1694, and Ministry of Revenue from 1692 to 1701. He was also a member of Grand Secretariat during Kangxi Emperor's reign, and was an important supporter of the 8th Prince Yinsi (Yunsi). In 1708, Maci, Tong Guowei (佟國維), Alingga (阿靈阿) and Olondai (鄂倫岱) proposed designating Yinsi as Crown Prince but was refused by the emperor. He was stripped of his official position and forced into house arrest.
Maci returned to politics after Yongzheng Emperor ascended the throne. He sat on the emperor's top advisory board along with Yunsi, Yunxiang, and Longkodo. He retired in 1735, and died in 1739.
Fuheng, Fucing were his nephews, and Empress Xiaoxianchun his niece.

Religious views of José Rizal

During his exile in Dapitan in 1892, Dr. Jose Rizal had the opportunity to engage Fr. Pastells through correspondence. They argued about many things including the concept of God.
Based on the letters Dr. Rizal wrote, it can be said that his concept of God could be summarized into three notions. First, he believed that God existed. Second, he believed that God was "Plus Supra". Lastly, he believed that God was the origin of nature; that is, nature was the expression of God.
As regards the first notion, Dr. Rizal made explicit that he believed that God existed. He was convinced that a supernatural power behind all of creation had to exist. He says to Fr. Pastells, "We are entirely in accord in admitting the existence of God: how can I doubt it when I am convinced of my own existence? Who recognizes the effect recognizes the cause." It was clear that Dr. Rizal subscribed to the idea of "necessary-contingent beings" where the contingent being needed other beings for it to exist while the necessary being existed on its own. As such, the necessary being becomes the origin of contingent beings. This necessary being has been labeled by many as "God."
Dr. Rizal considered himself as a contingent being that needed other beings to sustain his existence. Such other beings included the origin of all; the necessary being, God. He accepted that he was part of the whole of creation. He could not deny himself. Hence, he could not deny creation. As such, he could not deny God.
As regards the second notion, Dr. Rizal argued that his God was not like the God of the Catholics, as his God was far above such things. He says to Fr. Pastells, "In the conviction that I find myself before the Supreme Problem, which confused voices desire to explain to me, I cannot but answer: 'That may be so; but the God that I surmise is much greater, much better: "Plus Supra"!" He thought that a requirement to the Godliness of God was His being above all things, which meant His being incomprehensible. 
Dr. Rizal was not convinced that a sufficient understanding of God that was as powerful and metaphysical as the Supreme Being could be contained in the consciousness of mere mortals who have no capacity to understand beyond what was in the words of Nietzsche "divined" to them. Mortals who were so limited could not have possibly comprehended a limitless being. As such, Dr. Rizal articulated that the only genuine faith was "blind faith." In short, the more people tried to explain to him what and who God was, the more he got convinced that they did not know what they were talking about.
What Dr. Rizal meant by "blind faith" was, since it was impossible to comprehend God as He was "Plus Supra", he could have only hinged his belief on the fact that "God was God." As such, he did not deny nor did he accept the religious explanations of the mortals around him. Blind faith was more of a disposition of philosophy than of religion. It was a disposition where one did not accept and deny despite having a personal conviction.
As regards the third notion, Dr. Rizal believed that if one was to "understand" God, he was going to do well to note that books which others claimed were tools of revelation were not reliable. The reason was books were too removed from actual reality as these were written by people, interpreted by others, rewritten by people, obscured by others, etc. The best way to have an idea of God was through connecting with Him personally, directly and physically through His extensions. These extensions were nature.
Dr. Rizal says to Fr. Pastells, "I believe in revelation, yes, but in that living revelation of nature which surrounds us everywhere, in that potent voice, eternal, incessant, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal like the Being from which it originates, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can reveal to us better the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom?"
Dr. Rizal's philosophico-religious view on God was well-reflected on. It was a product of competent ratiocination by an "Indio" whom the Spaniards then undermined. He did not content himself with the teachings he grew up with as a student of Catholic institutions. He explored, rationalized, and argued. He asked questions about faith and the fundamental teachings of the Church. He was however careful not to offend the religious sensibilities of his countrymen. To him, ratiocination was simply a gift from God. To not use it would thus have been offensive to the Giver.

Professional boxing career.
In March 2017, Geovana Peres made her professional debut against veteran kickboxer Sarah Long. Long who had five wins and four losses in kick boxing, didn't start off very well in professional boxing. Long was defeated by Nailini Helu and Cheyenne Whaanga, both who were once top 10 boxers.

Isotaro Sugata

Isotaro Sugata (Japanese: 須賀田礒太郎 Sugata, Isotaro; Yokohama, 15 November 1907 – Tanuma, Tochigi, 5 July 1952) was a Japanese composer.
Biography.
Sugata received his education with missionaries in Kanto Gakuin University. There he was influenced by listening to hymns and received lessons for piano, violin, music theory and singing. In 1927 he acquired tuberculosis and then concentrated solely on his composition studies. From 1928 he studied with Kosaku Yamada and Kiyoshi Nobutoki, who had studied in Berlin. Nobutoki taught him music theory in the German tradition.
In 1931 he began studies with Meiro Sugahara, who believed that German music was not a good model for Japanese composers who wanted to compose in Western style with Japanese sensibility, on the principles of Gagaku, Buddhist music and Kabuki music. He considered French, Italian and Russian music more appropriate for the Japanese mentality, because it offers more flexible sounds by using Whole tone and Japanese scales. Sugahara gave the advice to Sugata that composers such as Shiro Fukai were better than the works of Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, Igor Stravinsky, Ottorino Respighi and Darius Milhaud to study. As a result, Sugata wrote two major orchestral works in a style that can be described as "Oriental Stravinsky", namely "Yokohama" (1932) and "Symphonic Fantasia" SAKURA "(Cherry Blossoms)" (1933).
In 1933 he returned to German-tinted music and studied with Klaus Pringsheim Sr., a teacher in the neoclassical style and a former pupil of Gustav Mahler, who at the time was a professor at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music. From then on he studied German music from Johann Sebastian Bach to Paul Hindemith and was interested in Arnold Schoenberg and his atonal music. In 1935 his piece "Japanese Picture Scroll", won a composition competition held by the Imperial Household Agency. The following year he also won a competition held by the (NHK) with his work "Festive Prelude".
During the Second World War he left for Tanuma, where his grandparents lived. He wanted to compose further, but his illness made working difficult for him. He died on 5 July 1952. Most of his works were not published and his manuscripts were forgotten in their house in Tanuma. It was only in 1999 the manuscripts were found again and received public attention.

A Very British Coup (TV series)

A Very British Coup is a 1988 British political serial adapted from Chris Mullin's 1982 novel "A Very British Coup" in 1988 by screenwriter Alan Plater and director Mick Jackson. Starring Ray McAnally, the series was first screened on Channel 4 and won Bafta and Emmy awards, and was screened in more than 30 countries.
The 2012 four-part Channel 4 series "Secret State" was "inspired" by the same novel. It starred Gabriel Byrne and was written by Robert Jones.
Plot.
Harry Perkins, an unassuming, working class, very left-wing Leader of the Labour Party and Member of Parliament for Sheffield Central, becomes Prime Minister in March 1991. The priorities of the Perkins Government include dissolving all newspaper monopolies, withdrawal from NATO, removing all American military bases on UK soil, unilateral nuclear disarmament, and true open government. Newspaper magnate Sir George Fison, with allies within British political and Civil Service circles, moves immediately to discredit him, with the United States the key, but covert, conspirator. The most effective of the Prime Minister's domestic enemies is the aristocratic Sir Percy Browne, Head of MI5, whose ancestors "unto the Middle Ages" have exercised subtle power behind the scenes. However, Perkins finds support in Joan Cook, his Home Secretary; Fred Thompson, his Press Secretary; Inspector Page, his police bodyguard; and Sir Montague Kowalski, the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence.
The US Secretary of State visits London and informs Perkins that his country will apply severe financial pressure in retaliation for his actions. The government turns to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which agrees to help, but only on condition that Perkins abandons most of his policies. While the IMF offer is being debated in cabinet, Perkins receives a call from his Foreign Secretary Tom Newsome, who has been having meetings in Sweden, and is able to announce that the International State Bank of Moscow has agreed to lend the money without preconditions. In retaliation, Newsome's affair with a woman with spurious IRA connections is reported by Fison's newspapers, resulting in his eviction from the Cabinet and his wife's suicide.
Failed negotiations between the Government and labour unions to formulate an economic strategy results in a strike by the Power Workers' Union purportedly over job losses that might be caused by the adoption of alternative energy. The resultant blackouts seriously damage public opinion of the Perkins Government. After Thompson outlines the members of the conspiracy, including the moderate, politically ambitious Chancellor of the Exchequer Lawrence Wainwright, Perkins bluffs Wainwright into ending the strike by threatening to investigate his connections with his co-conspirators and subsequently demotes him to Northern Ireland Secretary. Cook is promoted to Chancellor of the Exchequer.
The Perkins Government's policies for nuclear disarmament and neutrality, despite the live national broadcast of the disarming of a nuclear warhead, are hampered by the Chiefs of Staff fudging the figures regarding British, Allied and Warsaw Pact military capabilities, representatives of the United States stalling over the removal of US military bases by running out the clock on Perkins's term in office, and the covert assassination of the Sir Montague staged as a road accident.
Browne presents Perkins with forged evidence of financial irregularity following a short-lived affair years previously. He suggests that Perkins should resign rather than see the story made public, the groundwork having been laid with manufactured press speculation over Perkins's health and fake polls suggesting overwhelming public support for a Wainwright premiership. He agrees to make a resignation speech on live television, but instead announces the attempted blackmail and calls for a new election. Senior Army officers and security service officials watch in silence. The final sequence, on the morning of the election, is deliberately ambiguous, but implies that a military coup has begun.
Production.
Setting.
The series is set in 1991 and 1992, which was then the near future from when it was made (1988), with a King as the British monarch (the royal cypher on one of the Prime Minister's red boxes is shown as "C III R," suggesting that the monarch is Charles III, the current Prince of Wales). The 1991 and 1992 dates can be clearly seen on several newspapers and car tax discs shown on screen.
Writing.
The endings of the novel and the television version are significantly different. In the novel, the Prime Minister is forced from office following a catastrophic nuclear accident at an experimental nuclear plant that he had pushed for while Secretary of State for Energy in a previous government. This is the most explicit parallel between Harry Perkins and Tony Benn who was in the post from 1975 to 1979. The ending was changed because "the TV people thought [Mullin] had allowed Perkins to cave in and resign too easily when he's blackmailed." 
Home media and streaming.
The TV series of "A Very British Coup" was released in the UK on DVD (region 2) in September 2011. The series is available for streaming within the United Kingdom on Channel 4's website.
Awards.
The TV version of "A Very British Coup" won four Bafta Awards in 1989 – for Best Actor (Ray McAnally), Best Drama Series, Best Film Editor (Don Fairservice) and Best Film Sound – and a 1988 International Emmy Award for Best Drama.

Rockett's New School

Rockett's New School is a 1997 girl-oriented video game developed by Silicon Valley-based Purple Moon. It was directed by Brenda Laurel.
Production.
Five years of research were spent on the game. During this time, Laurel discovered that boys and girls play games differently, and that girls wanted a more slower-paced and introspective experience as opposed to the action-based twitch gameplay that appealed to boys. A website launch and a serious media hype preceded the release of Purple Moon's first two titles: "Rockett's New School" and "Secret Paths". Two 30-second TV spots for the games were aired on network and cable stations in New York and Chicago in October-November 1997. Rockett even appeared with a mustache in the "Got Milk?" ad series. The game was conceived as part of an episodic series of CD-ROMS, with unresolved plot elements that would be addressed in the following titles. Episode 2, "Rockett's Tricky Decision", was expected to come out in January 1998. The game's success led to a website, merchandise, and talks about a television adaption. Mattel bought Purple Moon in 1999 in order to add the Rockett brand to their success girl's video gaming empire that had begun with Barbie. Mattel aimed to expand the franchise with a book series. Another game entitled "Starfire Soccer Challenge" was not serialised due to the imminent acquisition of the company by Mattel.
Gameplay and design.
The game follows Rockett Movado as she begins the first day of eighth grade at her new school. The game's genre is "friendship adventures for girls", which Wired deemed to be a new game category created by Brenda Laurel, Purple Moon's co-founder. The game's design was built on the notion of girls not wanting to play as a superhero, rather as a friend, experiencing real-life events, encounters, and emotions that they would understand. The player can discover more about each player by examining their locker or reading their journal, which allowed each character more three-dimensionality than in traditional hero vs villain games. The game avoids text when it can and instead portrays information through graphical imagery, in order to help players identify with the protagonist by seeing what she sees.
In the sequel, "Rockett's Tricky Decision", Rockett is invited to two parties on the same night.
Critical reception.
The first Christmas sell-in exceeded the developer's expectations, and the press coverage was 95 percent positive. During December 1997 alone, "Rockett's New School" sold 39,174 units in the United States, for revenues of $1.1 million. It ultimately sold 250,000 units. However, a review by "The New York Times" commented that he didn't need to play the game with young girls because he knew a bad game when he saw it, which was reprinted in a popular Silicon Valley newspaper "San Jose Mercury News". The title became attacked by both reviewers (who felt it was objectively a poor game) and feminists (who felt it was a bad example of what a "game for girls" could be). "Entertainment Weekly" described the title as "thoughtfully addictive". "CNN" asserts that while successful, the games never "became the runaway hits the company hoped they would be".
In a retrospective review, "Buzzfeed" called the title "The Mean Girls Of '90s Games". Laurel herself asserts that girls found a community within the game.

33 (Wanessa album)

33 is the eighth studio album by Brazilian singer Wanessa Camargo. Originally the album was released on August 19, 2016 exclusively for free digital download through Palco MP3, Brazilian portal of execution of online music. On October 14, 2016 is released for digital sale through iTunes independently by its producer Work Show. At the end of 2016 the singer signs with Som Livre and on March 28, 2017, the album is re-released by the label - this time also in physical form - bringing two new songs as bonus. The album marks the transfer of the artist of pop to the sertanejo, musical genre that adopted from then on.
The first single of the album was "Coração Embriagado", composed by the sertanejo duo João Neto &amp; Frederico in partnership with Gabriel of Cavaco, Shylton Fernandes and Diego Ferrari and was officially launched on the digital platforms on August 5. "Vai que Vira Amor" was released as a promotional single on July 26. "Anesthesia" was released as a second single on March 10, 2017.
Background.
On August 22, 2014 the producer Mr. Jam confirmed that Wanessa began working on a new album unpublished, being produced by him. However, only on March 13, 2015 did the singer confirm that she was really engaged in the project, saying that it would take a few months to be released and citing her "W" album as a reference of what she was doing, claiming that she was seeking a sonority between pop and electronic. In April he confirmed that he was recording with producer César Lemos, who had previously worked with her on albums "W" and "Meu Momento", using tracks "Amor, Amor" and "Sem Querer" as references of the material he was preparing. On July 8, during an interview for "Quem" magazine, she revealed that the new album would mix songs in English and Portuguese, since she had not recorded in the native language for six years: "It's a fusion of everything I did before with I'm always reinventing myself, looking for new things, but with more maturity." Soon after confirmed the partnership in compositions with Liah Soares and Junno Andrade.
On December 8, however, he announced that he gave up recording tracks in English and that the new album would be entirely in Portuguese, mixing dance songs and other romantic songs, returning the missing link before on the album "Meu Momento". In addition, Wanessa revealed that he was composing again, which did not make the album cited, and intended to bring a mostly authorial work: "The album will be more personal than I could ever imagine. very introspective and mature, but will have more agitated bands." At the beginning of 2016 he photographed for the insert and dissemination of the new work, having the photos recorded by Fernando Mazza and the clothes signed by Alexandre Dornellas. According to her husband, Marcus Buaiz, the expectation was that the disc was released in May.
Recording and development.
On May 17, Wanessa announces that he has crated the material he was recording until then and switched the producer team to make a redirection in his career, leaving pop music to focus on sertanejo music now. For this, it adopted again the surname Camargo in its artistic name, which had been retired 8 years before for the album "Total". At the time he entered the studio to record his eighth album again, this time under the new genre chosen, bringing Eduardo Pepato as producer, the same as the work of Luan Santana and Thaeme &amp; Thiago. According to Wanessa, the decision to change the musical genre was based on the personal identification of the sertanejo music: "The road to pop in Brazil, I do not identify myself. It is not my beach. My footprint is romanticism and the sertanejo is a strong brand of my next album. I'm doing what I believe."
In addition, the singer explained that she was looking to do great shows in arenas again: "I want to run Brazil with the structure that I have always wanted, with the electronic, I went through each situation." Soon after breaking with Sony Music, alleging disagreements about the course of his career, since the record company would not like it to leave the pop sound, signing soon after with the Work Show, producer responsible for launching the market sertanejo. The first track announced as part of the album was "Now I Know," written in honor of her husband. On June 15 a preview of "Vai que Vira Amor" is released.
Release.
The album was released on August 19 exclusively for streaming and free digital download through Palco MP3, the best-known Brazilian online music portal. On October 14, 2016 is released for digital sale through iTunes and streaming independently by its producer Work Show. On December 20, 2016, Wanessa announces that he had signed with Som Livre and on March 10, 2017 the album is re-released by the label - this time also in physical form, in addition to the previous formats -, bringing two new songs as bonus.
Promotion.
On August 20 he presented himself at the sixty-first edition of the Festa do Peão de Barretos, announcing his new work during the Maiara &amp; Maraisa show, in which he sang with them "Coração Embriagado." On September 6 he plays for the first time on television the first single of the album, in the program Música Boa Ao Vivo. September 15 is the time to release the album on the program "De Cara", on FM O Dia. On September 23, Wanessa is interviewed in the program of Jô, where he announces his new album, besides singing the tracks "Coração Embriagado" and "Vai Que Vira Amor". On October 5 she is interviewed in the talk show "Programa do Porchat", where she explains the creative process of the album and sings the first single, besides "Perseguição". On January 27, 2017, it was Wanessa's turn to record the "Sabadão com Celso Portiolli" where he sang several of his old hits and the new single "Coração Embriagado" and released his CD. And on March 28 he participated in the Feast of the Mothers in Minas Gerais with Marília Mendonça and Maiara and Maraísa.
Critical reception.
The album received negative reviews, being considered "Selling out" and "artificial". Emilio Faustino, from the iG portal, said that by choosing the backwoodsman, Wanessa made a choice "to be convenient if we consider the good phase of the female backwoods in Brazil." He also stated that "During the release of the new album the singer managed to get the heresy of labeling herself as" Camaleoa "(...) if you simply change to make more of it and lean on the success of something that you can not even identify sound of great opportunism and lack of personality."
The music critic Mauro Ferreira of the G1 said that the album "besides sounding artificial and strategic, represents a setback in Wanessa's (rather irregular) discography." Renan Guerra, from The Hatch, evaluated the album with a (1.5 / 5), saying that "Wanessa sounds cold during the almost 50 minutes of 33" and that "the whole production of the disc sounds sufficiently cast. It's as if Wanessa were a newcomer, trying to embrace at all costs the lynch of the university sertanejo, even though his music sounds pasteurized and apathetic."

Poulsbo Bread

Poulsbo Bread is the name of a proprietary variety of multigrain bread that originated in Poulsbo, Washington, United States, in the 1970s, and which was distributed internationally until the 2000s. The creation of the bread was inspired by a Bible passage. As of 2018 it is sold only at a single retail location in Poulsbo. 
History.
Poulsbo Bread was developed by Marion Sluys, the owner of Sluys' Bakery in Poulsbo, from a biblical recipe. In 1974, after reading a passage in the Book of Ezekiel directing the baking of a specific type of multigrain bread, Sluys claims he decided to attempt to prepare the recipe in his Poulsbo bakery, naming the resulting product Poulsbo Bread. The passage in question, , reads: 
According to Sluys' Bakery, the bread was licensed to Franz Family Bakeries in the early 1980s for national and international distribution, with the license terms requiring Ezekiel 4:9 be imprinted on all packaging. In 2011, Franz discontinued mass production of Poulsbo Bread due to lagging demand for the product, however, as of 2018 the bread continues to be hand-mixed at Sluys' Bakery for local sale. Sluys' Bakery produces Poulsbo Bread in three varieties: regular, dark, and raisin.
Reception.
The bread has been variously described as "famous" and "world famous". According to "Sea Magazine", Poulsbo Bread is the "best-known concoction" of Sluys' Bakery, and few boaters visiting Poulsbo leave the town "without carrying home a loaf or two". In 2008, a student of Libby High School in Libby, Montana, credited his decision to move to Kitsap County and attend Olympic College on an athletic scholarship to his affinity for Poulsbo Bread, saying he regularly purchased the product at his local grocery store and, after reading a description of the town of Poulsbo on the packaging of the bread, thought "it would be a cool place to live".

Hemp paper

Hemp paper means paper varieties consisting exclusively or to a large extent from pulp obtained from fibers of industrial hemp. The products are mainly specialty papers such as cigarette paper, banknotes and technical filter papers. Compared to wood pulp, hemp pulp offers a four to five times longer fibre, a significantly lower lignin fraction as well as a higher tear resistance and tensile strength. Because the paper industry's processes have been optimized for wood as the feedstock, production costs currently are much higher than for paper from wood.
History.
The first identified coarse paper, made from hemp, dates to the early Western Han Dynasty, 200 years before the nominal invention of papermaking by Cai Lun, who improved and standardized paper production using a range of inexpensive materials, including hemp ends, around 2000 years ago. Recycled hemp clothing, rags, and fishing nets were used as inputs for paper production. By the sixth century AD, the papermaking process spread to Korea, where cannabis had been used previously for thousands of years, and Japan, where cannabis had been used for 10,000 years.
Early Western use.
Hemp paper only reached Europe in the 13th century via the Middle East. In Germany it was used for the first time in the 14th century. It was not until the 19th century that methods were established for the production of paper from wood pulp, which were cheaper than the hemp paper production and, above all, repressed in the area of writing and printing papers. Notably, the first copies of the Bible were made of hemp paper.
The Saint Petersburg, Russia, paper mill of Goznak opened in 1818. It used hemp as its main input material. Paper from the mill was used in the printing of "bank notes, stamped paper, credit bills, postal stamps, bonds, stocks, and other watermarked paper."
20th century.
In 1916, U.S. Department of Agriculture chief scientists Lyster Hoxie Dewey and Jason L. Merrill created paper made from hemp pulp and concluded that paper from hemp hurds was "favorable in comparison with those used with pulp wood." The chemical composition of hemp hurds is similar to that of wood, making hemp a good choice as a raw material for manufacturing paper. A later book about hemp and other fibers by the same L.H. Dewey(1943) have no words about hemp as a raw material for production of paper.
Dried hemp has about 57% cellulose (the principal ingredient in paper), compared to about 40-50% in wood. Hemp also has the advantage of a lower lignin content: hemp contains only 5-24% lignin against the 20-35% found in wood. This lignin must be removed chemically and wood requires more use of chemicals in the process. The actual production of hemp fiber in the U.S continued to decline until 1933 to around 500 tons/year. Between 1934 and 1935, the cultivation of hemp began to increase, but still at a very low level and with no significant increase of paper from hemp.
After the Second World War, industrial hemp was only grown on micro-plots. Although the industrial hemp bred in the 1950s and 1960s is harmless because of the almost complete absence of THC, cultivation has been banned in many countries in recent decades. In Germany, growing hemp was completely prohibited between 1982 and 1995 by the "Betäubungsmittelgesetz" (Narcotics Act, the national controlled-substances law) in order to prevent the illegal use of cannabis as a narcotic. Especially in France, the varieties of hemp used for the manufacture of cigarette paper were still in use and grown (see Hemp in France). As of 1994, most of the French hemp crop was used to make rolling paper, currency, and high quality paper for Bibles (India paper).
Fiber sources.
Before the industrialisation of paper production the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, called rags. The rags were from hemp, linen and cotton. A process for removing printing inks from recycled paper was invented by German jurist Justus Claproth in 1774. Today this method is called deinking. It was not until the introduction of wood pulp in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from ragpickers.
Contemporary.
Currently there is a small niche market for hemp pulp, for example as cigarette paper. Hemp fiber is mixed with fiber from other sources than hemp. In 1994 there was no significant production of 100% true hemp paper. World hemp pulp production was believed to be around 120,000 tons per year in 1991 which was about 0.05% of the world's annual pulp production volume. The total world production of hemp fiber had in 2003 declined to about 60,000 from 80,000 tons. This can be compared to a typical pulp mill for wood fiber, which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum. The cost of hemp pulp is approximately six times that of wood pulp, mostly because of the small size and outdated equipment of the few hemp processing plants in the Western world, and because hemp is harvested once a year (during August) and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through. This storage requires a lot of (mostly manual) handling of the bulky stalk bundles. Another issue is that the entire hemp plant cannot be economically prepared for paper production. While the wood products industry uses nearly 100% of the fiber from harvested trees, only about 25% of the dried hemp stem—the bark, called bast—contains the long, strong fibers desirable for paper production. All this accounts for a high raw material cost. Hemp pulp is bleached with hydrogen peroxide, a process today also commonly used for wood pulp.
Market share.
The use of hemp fiber for paper production represented 90% of the (legal) use of hemp in Europe at the end of the 1990s, with the release of the cultivation of industrial hemp in other parts of Europe in recent years, the share of the increase in other types of use (textiles, natural fiber reinforced plastics) is currently around 70 to 80% and is still the most important hemp product line in Europe. Today, hemp is used for cigarette paper among other things in Spain and in United Kingdom.
Around the year 2000, the production volume for flax and hemp pulp totalled 25,000 to 30,000 tonnes per year, which was produced from about 37,000 to 45,000 tonnes of fibers. Up to 80% of the produced pulp is used for specialty papers (including 95% cigarette paper). Only about 20% goes into the standard pulp area and are here in mostly lower quality wood pulp (unpurified tow with high hurd content). In the case of hemp pulp alone, the proportion of specialty papers is probably around 99%. The market is considered to be saturated, so no or only low growth in this area is predicted.
Costs.
Production costs are about four times higher than for paper from wood since the infrastructure for using hemp is underdeveloped. For the most part, hemp paper is used for specialty applications and not for mass applications such as printing, writing and packaging paper. If the paper industry were to switch from wood to hemp for sourcing its cellulose fibers, the following benefits could be utilized to offset the cost differential:
In 2019, Cornish Hemp Company, Quintessential Tips created the world's first consumable product with its packaging made from hemp paper, thus beginning the change from standard packaging materials to hemp.

Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution

Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution is a bimonthly peer-reviewed scientific journal covering all aspects of the ecology, evolution or genetics of behaviour. It was established in 1890 as Monitore Zoologico Italiano, obtaining its current name in 1989, with volume numbering restarted at 1. It is published by Taylor &amp; Francis and the editor-in-chief is Alberto Ugolini (University of Florence).
A brief history.
The journal was established in 1890 by Giulio Chiarugi and Eugenio Ficalbi (who edited it until 1922) as the "Monitore Zoologico Italiano". From the start, a specific interest is declared for zoology, anatomy, and embryology. The Unione Zoologica Italiana was founded in 1900 and in the same year the "Monitore" became its official journal. In 1923 Ficalbi was succeeded by Angelo Senna. From 1930 to 1933 the journal also became the official journal of the Società Italiana di Anatomia. Since 1934 it is no longer the organ of the Unione Zoologica Italiana and from 1934 to 1966 it is only the organ of the Società Italiana di Anatomia of which the proceedings of the conferences are published. Until 1943 it was edited by Chiarugi and Senna. In 1944 Giuseppe Colosi took over and edited the journal until 1967. In addition to Colosi, in 1946 Nello Beccari and Senna joined as editors. In 1951 Ignazio Fazzari replaced Senna. From 1957 on, the editors were Colosi, Fazzari, and Emanuele Padoa. In 1962 Leo Pardi also became part of the editorial committee.
In 1967, under the direction of Pardi, the Monitore was published every three months, in English, with the advice of an international advisory board and with the subtitle of Italian Journal of Zoology, and was mainly addressed to Zoology and Ethology. In 1967 the number of directors rises to 6 with the entry of Alberto Monroy and Floriano Papi. In 1968 and 1970 Valdo Mazzi and Baccio Baccetti join the editorial committee. In 1975, Colosi dies. In 1982, the directors are Pardi, Papi, Baccetti, Fazzari and Antonio Ercolini.
In 1985 Fazzari is no longer in the group of directors.
Since 1967, an annual Supplement of the Monitore has been published in relation to the development of zoology research in tropical areas (in particular Somalia following the foundation of the Centro di Studio per la Faunistica ed Ecologia Tropicali del Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, directed by Pardi) The publication of the Supplement will last until 1987, becoming independent magazine since 1988, with the name of Tropical Zoology.
Starting from 1975 the "Monitore Zoologico Italiano" publishes a series of monographs focusing on themes of parasitology, herpetology, and ethology.
Since 1989 the Monitore becomes "Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution", editor Francesco Dessì–Fulgheri. From 2010 it is published by Taylor &amp; Francis. In 2015 Alberto Ugolini became editor-in-chief.

Autopista de la Isla de la Juventud

The Autopista de la Isla de la Juventud, also known as Autopista Gerona-La Fe, is a Cuban motorway linking Nueva Gerona to Santa Fe (also named La Fe), the principal settlements of the Isla de la Juventud (Isle of Youth). It is a toll-free road and, with a length of , is the shortest Cuban motorway.
Route.
The motorway is a dual carriageway with 4 lanes and has some at-grade intersections with rural roads. It starts south of Nueva Gerona, from the provincial road "Carretera a Siguanea", between town's center and José Martí ward. After a km, the motorway intersects the east beltway and, after another km, it is an exit connectingt the "autopista" with Rafael Cabrera Mustelier Airport, 2 km far. The other exits along the route are, in many cases, far from the villages, as the one serving La Demajagua (20 km west). The motorway ends northwest of Santa Fe, where it is divided into a pair of provincial road: one crosses the town in the middle, the other goes close to the western suburb.

Højbro Plads 6

Højbro Plads 6 is a listed property located on Højbro Plads in the Old Town of Copenhagen, Denmark.
History.
Højbro Plads 6 was built in 1804-1806 by Niels Schønberg Kurtzhals (c.1773-1829) for textile merchant Lorentz Andreas Hinrichsen. The property was one of the last buildings on the square to be completed after the whole area had been destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795.
Henrichsen was married to Marie Christine Wolff (1776-1830) and they had fice children, two bos and three girls, by the time that the building was completed. They later had three more children of which one, a daughter, died as an infant. Lorentz Andreas Hinrichsen died in 1824.
The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918.
Architecture.
The building is four storeys high and five bays wide. The outer windows on the first floor are topped by triangular pediments. A depression indicates that a frieze has originally been located above the windows of the second floor.

He is an elected member of the National Academy of Education as well as of the International Academy of Education. Professor Carnoy has graduated nearly 100 PhD students, a record at Stanford University. 
Biography.
Martin Carnoy is the Vida Jacks Professor of Education at Stanford University School of Education. Prior to coming to Stanford, he was a Research Associate in Economics, Foreign Policy Division, at the Brookings Institution. Carnoy is affiliated with the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), Center for Education Policy Analysis (CEPA), and is a member of the American Educational Research Association's Grants Board Committee. He is also an elected member of the National Academy of Education and the International Academy of Education. Carnoy has worked as a consultant to the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, UNESCO, International Energy Agency, OECD, UNICEF, International Labour Office. Martin Carnoy received his B.A. in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology (1960) and a M.A. and Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago (1961 and 1964.)
Research.
Dr. Carnoy is a labor economist with a special interest in the relation between the economy and the educational system. To this end, he studies the US labor market, including the role in that relation of race, ethnicity, and gender, the US educational system, and systems in many other countries. He uses comparative analysis to understand international comparative education, the economics of education and applied econometrics, with a focus on the political economy of education.
Through his research, Carnoy has argued that educational policy is used by capitalist nations' "bourgeois elites" as a form of cultural imperialism in order to perpetuate the conditions allowing for the exploitation of working classes both within and without these nations through e.g. education systems that support inherited advantages ("Education as Cultural Imperialism," 1974). He has chronicled how Marxist views on the role of the state shifted considerably throughout the 20th century, sometimes bearing little loyalty to the original views of Karl Marx ("The State and Political Theory," 1984). Dr. Carnoy also has explored how Cuba leverages small, personalized schools, highly trained teachers, strong principals, a coherent curriculum and long-term relationships between teachers and students to academically outperform most other Latin American countries ("Cuba's Academic Advantage, 2007)". Together with Luis Beneviste and Richard Rothstein, Carnoy has weighed in on the debate between private and public education, arguing that many private schools in inner cities face the same problems as their neighboring public schools and thus questioning the extent to which they can be part of the solution. Similarly, Carnoy, Rothstein, Lawrence Mishel and Rebecca Jacobsen have contributed to the debate on charter schools through their book "The Charter School Dust-Up", wherein they compare student enrollment and achievement in charter and public schools and explain the finding that students in the later tend on average to academically outperform students in the former.
Carnoy has conducted research on the impact of school accountability on learning, the effectiveness and efficiency of private schools, the impact of globalization on education systems, school vouchers, flexible work, and the impact of structural adjustment on education. Key findings of Carnoy's research include:

Cambridge Central Mosque

The Cambridge Central Mosque is Europe's first eco-friendly mosque and the first purpose-built mosque within the city of Cambridge, England. Its mandate is to meet the needs of the Muslim community in the UK and beyond by facilitating good practice in faith, community development, social cohesion &amp; interfaith dialogue. The Cambridge Central Mosque was opened to the public on 24 April 2019.
Background.
The Muslim Academic Trust (MAT) proposed the site location to be situated in the Romsey area of Mill Road in Cambridge. Thereafter, the Cambridge Mosque Project was established in 2008 by Dr Timothy Winter, a lecturer in Islamic studies at the University of Cambridge, to raise funds for the project.
After the £4m purchase of a one-acre site in 2009 on Mill Road, Marks Barfield Architects was appointed to design the new mosque in association with Professor Keith Critchlow, a world leading expert in sacred architecture and Islamic geometry along with the UK's leading Islamic garden designer Emma Clark. Marks Barfield Architects are known for innovative designs such as the London Eye and Kew Gardens Treetop Walk, to name a few. Plans for the mosque were submitted to the Cambridge City Council by the MAT and it was approved by the council in 2012. The project however was controversial and it was met with objections.
With its emphasis on sustainability and high reliance on green energy, the mosque is Europe's first eco-mosque. In addition to the mosque's dedicated areas (ablution, teaching, children's area, morgue), there is a café, teaching area and meeting rooms for use by the local Muslim and non-Muslim communities. It can accommodate up to 1000 worshippers.
Donors from Europe, Middle East, Asia and the Americas have supported the project, but most of the donations, around two-thirds of the total, came from Turkey. Construction started in September 2016, was completed in March 2019, and the mosque opened to the public on 24 April 2019. In 2021, the mosque was the subject of a profile on the Sky Arts programme "The Art of Architecture".

Cromer Conservation Park

 
Cromer Conservation Park is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Cromer in the Adelaide Hills state government region about north-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about north of the town centre in Birdwood.
The conservation park consists of land in section 9 in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Talunga. It was proclaimed under the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972" on 22 January 1976. As of 2016, it covered an area of .
In 1980, it was described as follows:One of few areas of natural vegetation in the Mount Lofty Ranges which have not been disturbed by a history of grazing or other deleterious land use. As such it is a highly significant remnant of the wetter Mount Lofty Range vegetation. Though a small reserve, it contains a wide diversity of plant and bird species. A small Park of gentle relief, exhibiting vegetation dominated by "Eucalyptus leucoxylon" / "E fasciculosa" open forest with "E. obliqua", "E. goniocalyx" and "E. camaldulensis". The understorey consists of a dense shrub heath in which species of "Acacia", "Hakea", "Banksia" and "Xanthorrhoea" are the dominant constituents. Approximately seventy bird species have been recorded in the park. The park is in pristine condition having never been grazed by stock, however its limited size means it is susceptible to outside disturbance. This area is bounded on two sides by pine plantations.
In 2016, the conservation park was reported as being one of three sites in South Australia where the blue star sun-orchid ("Thelymitra hygrophila") has been found. The orchid species was listed on 5 May 2016 as being "Critically Endangered" under the Australian "Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999".
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

Progesterone 3-acetyl enol ether

Progesterone 3-acetyl enol ether, also known as progesterone acetate, as well as 3-acetoxypregna-3,5-dien-20-one, is a progestin which was never marketed. It was reported to possess similar potency to progesterone and hydroxyprogesterone caproate in the rabbit endometrial carbonic anhydrase test, a bioassay of progestogenic activity. In addition, it was able to maintain pregnancy in animals. Progesterone 3-acetyl enol ether is closely related to quingestrone, which is also known as progesterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether and was formerly marketed as an oral contraceptive.
The 3-acetyl ether may be cleaved from progesterone 3-acetyl enol ether "in vivo" and, based on its chemical structure, this may result in the transformation of progesterone 3-acetyl enol ether into 3α-dihydroprogesterone and/or 3β-dihydroprogesterone. 3β-Dihydroprogesterone has been reported to possess about the same progestogenic potency as progesterone in the Clauberg test, whereas 3α-dihydroprogesterone was not assessed.
The C3 enol ethers of progesterone are less suited for use via depot injection relative to progestogen esters like hydroxyprogesterone caproate due to their susceptibility to oxidative metabolism.

Frauenau Dam

The Frauenau Dam ( or "Trinkwasserspeicher Frauenau") in the Bavarian Forest, was built in 1983 to ensure the drinking water supply to large parts of Lower Bavaria.
Description.
Because there was a shortage of groundwater in the Bavarian Forest due to the geological situation there, in the years 1976 to 1983 a water storage reservoir was built near Frauenau and Zwiesel, that was fed by the Kleiner Regen and Hirschbach rivers which rose in the unsettled area on the Czech border between the Falkenstein and Rachel.

2019 Castilian-Leonese regional election

The 2019 Castilian-Leonese regional election was held on Sunday, 26 May 2019, to elect the 10th Cortes of the autonomous community of Castile and León. All 81 seats in the Cortes were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in eleven other autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain, as well as the 2019 European Parliament election.
The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) saw its first plurality in a regional election in Castile and León since 1983, being only its second victory ever in the region, as support for the governing People's Party (PP) collapsed into the worst showing, either for it or for any of its previous incarnations, in history. However, as a result of a substantial increase for the liberal Citizens party (Cs), the two centre-right parties were able to retain a slim absolute majority of 41 seats, enabling PP candidate Alfonso Fernández Mañueco to become the region's new president.
Overview.
Electoral system.
The Cortes of Castile and León were the devolved, unicameral legislature of the autonomous community of Castile and León, having legislative power in regional matters as defined by the Spanish Constitution and the Castilian-Leonese Statute of Autonomy, as well as the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a regional president.
Voting for the Cortes was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in Castile and León and in full enjoyment of their political rights. Additionally, Castilian-Leonese people abroad were required to apply for voting before being permitted to vote, a system known as "begged" or expat vote (). All members of the Cortes of Castile and León were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with an electoral threshold of three percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each constituency. Seats were allocated to constituencies, corresponding to the provinces of Ávila, Burgos, León, Palencia, Salamanca, Segovia, Soria, Valladolid and Zamora, with each being allocated an initial minimum of three seats, as well as one additional member per each 45,000 inhabitants or fraction greater than 22,500.
The use of the D'Hondt method might result in a higher effective threshold, depending on the district magnitude.
Election date.
The term of the Cortes of Castile and León expired four years after the date of their previous election, unless they were dissolved earlier. The election decree was required to be issued no later than the twenty-fifth day prior to the date of expiry of parliament and published on the following day in the Official Gazette of Castile and León (BOCYL), with election day taking place on the fifty-fourth day from publication. The previous election was held on 24 May 2015, which meant that the legislature's term would have expired on 24 May 2019. The election decree was required to be published in the BOCYL no later than 30 April 2019, with the election taking place on the fifty-fourth day from publication, setting the latest possible election date for the Cortes on Sunday, 23 June 2019.
The president had the prerogative to dissolve the Cortes of Castile and León and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence was in process and that dissolution did not occur either during the first legislative session or before one year had elapsed since a previous dissolution. In the event of an investiture process failing to elect a regional president within a two-month period from the first ballot, the Cortes were to be automatically dissolved and a fresh election called.
Parliamentary composition.
The Cortes of Castile and León were officially dissolved on 2 April 2019, after the publication of the dissolution decree in the Official Journal of Castile and León. The tables below show the composition of the parliamentary groups in the Cortes at the time of dissolution.
Parties and candidates.
The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of at least one percent of the electorate in the constituencies for which they sought election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates.
Below is a list of the main parties and electoral alliances which contested the election:
Opinion polls.
The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The "Lead" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a given poll. When available, seat projections are also displayed below the voting estimates in a smaller font. 41 seats were required for an absolute majority in the Cortes of Castile and León (43 until 10 January 2018).

Willie Rioli

William Rioli (born 4 June 1995) is a professional Australian rules footballer playing for the West Coast Eagles in the Australian Football League (AFL). He was drafted by the West Coast Eagles with their third selection and fifty-second overall in the 2016 national draft. He made his debut in the fifty-one point win against the at Etihad Stadium in the round two of the 2018 season. Coming from the Rioli family, he is the first cousin of Dean Rioli (Essendon Football Club), Cyril Rioli (Hawthorn Football Club) and Ronnie Burns (from his mother's side), first cousin once removed of current Richmond Football Club player Daniel Rioli and the nephew of Maurice Rioli.
Scandals.
In September 2019, Rioli received an indefinite provisional suspension under the AFL and Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority anti-doping code for an alleged adverse analytical finding for urine substitution. Rioli publicly admitted to having smoked marijuana with other club members the night before his drug test, and is accused of attempting to swap his tainted urine with a clean sample in a Gatorade bottle. He was subsequently issued with an indefinite suspension from the AFL, and ruled out from competing with the West Coast Eagles in that year's finals series. Rioli was eventually handed a 2 year suspension in March 2021.
On 23 April 2021, Rioli was transiting through Darwin Airport where he was stopped and searched after drug detection dogs detected drugs. He was found to be carrying 25 grams of cannabis in his pants and was arrested and issued with a court attendance notice. He pleaded guilty, and was given a 12-month good behaviour bond. Rioli recommenced training with the West Coast Eagles just 2 months later in June. He will be eligible to play his first game back in round 23 of the 2021 AFL season.

Wi-Charge

Wi-Charge is an Israeli company developing technology and products for far-field wireless power transfer using focused infrared beams.
History.
Wi-Charge was founded in 2012 by Victor Vaisleib, Ori Mor and Ortal Alpert. The company is developing a unique far-field wireless power technology based on infrared laser beams. In 2015, Wi-Charge demonstrated its first prototype capable of charging small electronic devices. In 2017, the company claimed to obtain compliance with international safety standards. During CES 2018, Wi-Charge demonstrated simultaneous charging of multiple devices from a single transmitter.
Technology.
Wi-Charge claims to deliver power using focused beams of invisible infrared light. The system consists of a transmitter and a receiver. Transmitter connects to a standard power outlet and converts electricity into infrared laser beam. Receivers use a miniature photo-voltaic cell to convert transmitted light into electrical power. Receivers can be embedded into a device or connected into an existing charging port. The transmitter automatically identifies chargeable receivers and start charging. Several devices can charge at the same time. According to Wi-Charge it can deliver several watts of power to a device at several meters away. The core technology is based on a "distributed laser resonator" which is formed by the retroreflectors within the transmitter and the receiver. This unique concept allows the charging of multiple devices without any moving components and if an opaque object enters one of the beams the corresponding power transfer is turned off automatically.
Safety.
Because laser power in the single-digit watt range is used for energy transmission, ensuring product safety is crucial. Wi-Charge has stated that its technology complies with the IEC 60825-1 International Safety Standard (laser safety). According to this standard it is a Class 1 product."Class 1: Lasers that are safe under reasonably foreseeable conditions of operation, including the use of optical instruments for intrabeam viewing."In April 2019 the company announced that it has earned UL safety approval.
According to Wi-Charge, the system transmits power using a straight, narrow beam. The beam is contained into a small spot and all the energy falls inside the receiver. Therefore, nobody is exposed to radiated energy as long as the path between the transmitter and the receiver is not crossed. If the path between transmitter and receiver is blocked, transmission stops immediately. Once line of sight is restored, charging resumes. Wi-Charge claims that this mechanism ensures that energy exposure to people, animals or unrelated objects is always below the maximum permissible exposure (MPE):"Sending energy over a distance, a beam always diverges, which is a bad thing as too little power is going in the right direction, and too much power splits and goes elsewhere. With RF, only relatively humble distances can be achieved, with a power capacity about a fraction of a Watt, limited by the maximum level of exposure allowed for safety. Shorter wavelength beams maintain their integrity better. With an infrared laser, we have a practically non-diverging beam able to deliver its entire power content onto a small receiver"
Limitations and Advantages.
Some consider the necessity of a direct line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver to be a disadvantage of using laser to deliver power is. So, devices that are hidden (such as smartphone in your pocket or medical implant) cannot be charged using this technology. However, some see line of sight as an advantage because when line of sight is not used, there is potential for greater leakage of undesired energy into the environment, and there is full control over where the energy is going.
Companies that integrate Wi-Charge usually embed a rechargeable battery or super-capacitor in their products. This allows to both overcome periods where new charge is not received, as well as to deliver momentary larger bursts of energy than the average charging rate.
Wi-Charge does claim that using infrared light for long-range wireless power has advantages over using radio frequency or ultrasound because of two main reasons:

2018 Lewisham train strandings

The Lewisham train strandings occurred on 2 March 2018 in the area of , and stations during snowy and cold weather. Eleven trains were involved. Passengers abandoned five of the trains due to issues including a lack of communication, heating and toilets. No injuries were reported. Network Rail and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch conducted investigations into the incident.
Previous strandings.
Huntingdon.
In June 2005, a passenger train became stranded near for two hours. Conditions quickly became uncomfortable for the passengers on board. The Rail Safety and Standards Board subsequently conducted research into conditions on a stranded train with inoperable air conditioning. It concluded that conditions would become uncomfortable after 40–50 minutes, and intolerable after 70–90 minutes. Opening doors on the train would mean that conditions would be tolerable for up to five hours.
Aviemore.
On 31 March 2010, a passenger train became stranded in snow between and Slochd, Highland. More than 100 passengers had to be rescued.
Foxton.
In October 2010, a passenger train operated by First Capital Connect (FCC) became stranded at . The incident occurred at 16:44 hours. Conditions on board rapidly deteriorated, with temperatures reaching . Some passengers abandoned the train after 60 minutes, others broke windows after 2 hours. Passengers were rescued by using another service train drawing up alongside the broken down train, but it could only take 100 of the 375 passengers. A second train rescued the remaining passengers at 20:20.
Orpington.
In November 2010, a Southeastern passenger train became stranded near . Passengers remained on the train overnight.
Kentish Town.
On 26 May 2011, a passenger train formed of two Class 377 electric multiple units operated by FCC experienced pantograph damage and broke down between Dock Junction and whilst operating a service from to . The train was carrying 472 passengers. It took three hours for the failed train to be rescued. Absence of power meant that throughout this time, air conditioning and toilets on the train were inoperative. After 45 minutes the public address system failed, which prevented the driver from keeping the passengers informed of the situation. They then resorted to breaking windows and forcing doors open in an effort to alleviate their discomfort. The lack of communication caused some passengers to abandon the train and start walking along the track towards nearby Kentish Town station. When the train was eventually moved, and having been authorised to do so, the driver overrode a number of safety systems, leading to the train being moved with at least two doors open whilst passengers were on board. FCC policy at the time was that an evacuation of a train should be considered after 60 minutes and must have commenced within 90 minutes of a stranding. A Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) investigation found that FCC had failed to implement lessons learned from earlier train strandings. FCC were prosecuted by the Office of Rail and Road for offences under Section 3 (1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and fined £75,000.
South Croydon.
On 4 June 2011, a passenger train was brought to a halt near by the emergency braking system following activation of the passenger communication device. Some passengers abandoned the train after 30 minutes. One of them suffered severe burns when she came into contact with the third rail.
Peckham Rye.
On 7 November 2017, a Class 378 electric multiple unit became stranded short of station due to a fault causing the brakes to lock on. About 80 of the 450 passengers were evacuated with the third rail still live. No injuries occurred.
Dorset – Hampshire border.
On 1 March 2018, three passenger trains operated by South Western Railway (SWR) became stranded at , and in Dorset and Hampshire in snowy weather. Weather conditions hampered evacuation of the trains, which was not accomplished until the following morning. Passengers spent up to 14 hours on the stranded trains. Complaints were made of a lack of communication from SWR, a lack of heating and toilet facilities. A train operated by CrossCountry was also stranded in the area. Passengers praised the way CrossCountry staff dealt with the situation.
Haltwhistle.
On 1 March 2018, a passenger train became stranded in snow near , Northumberland. Passengers had to be rescued.
The incident.
On 2 March 2018, eleven passenger trains operated by Southeastern became stranded in the , and area in weather conditions of snow and freezing rain. Due to a lack of communication with passengers, a lack of heating and lack of toilets, passengers abandoned five of the nine trains. The eleven trains involved comprised at least 22 electric multiple units. Two of the units had no toilets, and five of the remaining twenty-plus were operating with toilets that were not in service. Four people were treated for minor injuries.
Timeline.
Train 2M48 came to a stand after passing Lewisham station, unable to draw power as the third rail was affected by freezing rain. The train comprised two Class 465 and one Class 466 electric multiple units and was operating the 15:56 to service which had departed 67 minutes late and was running 80 minutes late when it came to a stand. The units involved were 465 003, 465 164 and 466 024.
Train 2M50 came to a stand approaching Lewisham due to 2M48 being at a stand ahead. The train comprised two Class 376 electric multiple units, which did not have onboard toilets. It was operating the 16:26 Charing Cross to Dartford service which had departed 47 minutes late and was running 54 minutes late when it came to a stand. The units involved were 376 002 and 376 035.
Train 2S54 came to a stand opposite St Johns station. It comprised three Class 465 units and was operating the 17:06 Charing Cross to Orpington service which had departed 17 minutes late and was running 17 minutes late when it came to a stand. The train came to a stand with its rear carriages blocking Tanners Hill Junction.
Train 2R46 came to a stand between and St Johns. Train 2V07 came to a stand at St. Johns.
Train 2H50 came to a stand near New Cross. The train comprised two Class 465 and one Class 466 units and was operating the 17:30 Charing Cross to service which had departed on time and was running 1 minute early when it came to a stand.
Train 2H00 came to a stand approaching Tanners Hill Junction, which was blocked by train 2S54.
Train 2S56 came to a stand west of . The train comprised two Class 465 units and was operating the 17:36 Charing Cross to service which had departed one minute late and was running to time when it came to a stand.
Train 2R48 came to a stand behind train 2S56.
Train 2H02 came to a stand approaching the flyover at St Johns.
Network Rail called out a Mobile Operations Manager (MOM) to de-ice the third rail and get 2M48 moving again. It was planned to terminate the train at . Until 2M48 had been moved, other trains were unable to proceed, including 2M50, which was being held at a signal in sight of Lewisham station.
An Automatic Warning System fault developed on 2M48.
The MOM arrived on site. An emergency power isolation was made to the up and down North Kent Lines to enable the third rail to be de-iced.
Train 2K43 became stranded at Lewisham station due to the emergency power isolation.
The MOM reported that passengers had abandoned 2M50 and walking along the track to Lewisham station. An emergency power isolation was made covering all lines between North Kent East Junction and School Junction, Blackheath Junction to Nunhead, Courthill Junction and Tanners Hill. 2M50 had been at a stand for 67 minutes.
Some passengers abandoned 2S56, which had been at a stand for 72 minutes.
Some passengers abandoned 2M48, which had been at a stand for 92 minutes.
More passengers abandoned 2S56. Not reported until 19:40 as the driver was dealing with a passenger who had been taken ill.
Some passengers abandoned 2H50, which had been at a stand for 109 minutes.
More passengers abandoned 2M48, which had been at a stand for 168 minutes.
Current restored to area.
Train 2M48 was able to proceed.
Train 2M50 was able to proceed.
Train 2S54 was able to proceed.
Trains 2H00 and 2V07 were able to proceed.
Train 2H02 was able to proceed.
Trains 2K43 and 2R48 were able to proceed.
Train 2H50 was able to proceed.
Train 2S56 was able to proceed.
Criticism.
There was widespread criticism of the incident and the way it was handled. Southeastern also issued its own criticism of passengers who abandoned trains, describing them as "trespassers". "Rail Magazine" criticised Southeastern for swearing in a tweet responding to a query from a passenger on one of the stranded trains.
Passengers on board 2M50, which had no toilets and had been held within sight of Lewisham station, complained of the conditions on board. People were wetting and soiling themselves as there was no other option. They also complained that the train was being held in sight of the station and wondered why it could not be cleared into the platform. An investigation by "Rail" revealed that the driver had asked for such permission, but that the power had been switched off before this could be authorised and arranged. Other passengers complained of a lack of heating and lighting when the power had been cut off. One passenger wrote a detailed account of being stranded on 2M50, describing how conditions deteriorated on board the packed train, and criticising Southeastern for not following Rail Delivery Group guidance in respect of stranded trains, which states that evacuation of a stranded train should be commenced after an hour and completed within two hours.
Investigations.
Network Rail and Southeastern.
Network Rail and Southeastern commissioned consultants Arthur D Little and Southwood Rail Consulting to conduct an investigation into the incident. The report, released on 23 August, was highly critical of Southeastern and Network Rail finding that the rail industry's inadequate procedures were not fully followed, and that communication between the various parties involved did not adequately support effective management of the incident. Seventeen recommendations were made.
Rail Accident Investigation Branch.
The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) opened an investigation into the incident. It published its final report on 25 March 2019. Five recommendations were made and two learning points were identified.
The report found that neither train 2M48 been declared as failed, nor had train 2M50 had been declared as stranded. Train 2M48 had difficulty in starting from Lewisham because no de-icing fluid had been applied to the conductor rail since 22:34 on 1 March. De-icing fluid had an effective time of twelve hours. Due to the emergency timetable that had been implemented and late running trains, no train had passed over that section of line for about 90 minutes. No supplementary treatment of the conductor rail had been carried out. The signalling manager at London Bridge Control Centre was not sure that he had the authority to allow train 2M50 to pass signal L445 at danger under permissive working to allow it into the platform at Lewisham when he did have such authority. The decision to allow train 2M50 past signal L253 prevented it from being re-routed once train 2M48 experienced difficulty in starting from Lewisham. The management of the incident by Southeastern was not effective. Passenger communications via Twitter showed that the situation was rapidly deteriorating. There was no strategy to avoid trains being stranded between stations, whereas on the London Underground network, the policy is to hold trains at stations when there is disruption.
Response.
Network Rail and Southeastern issued a joint statement following the release of the RAIB's final report. Amongst measures introduced following the incident were better training for staff, the installation of heated conductor rails in some locations, introduction of more efficient de-icer for the conductor rails, improved radios for staff, the introduction of ice breaking shoes on some electric multiple units.

Edwin D. Mott

Edwin Debaun Mott (17 April 1894 – 1962) was an American architectural and landscape artist who developed a specialism in highly detailed aerial views. He is known for his composite Turner City drawings for Turner Construction which he completed from 1929 to 1962. The drawings are now in the United States National Building Museum in Washington, D.C.
Early life and family.
Edwin Mott was born in Passaic, New Jersey, on 17 April 1894 to Zaidee L. Mott and the inventor Samuel Dimmick Mott (1852–1930) who held 36 patents, including one for a prototype of the helicopter propeller and who worked with Thomas Edison at his Menlo Park laboratories. Samuel's brother, and Edwin's uncle, Charles P. Mott (d. 1908) also worked for Edison. Edwin married Louise and had two daughters. His nephew was the commercial artist and cartoonist Herb Mott.
Career.
Mott had no formal education in art or architecture and only became an artist after becoming an apprentice to an architect and being told that his talent lay in art not architecture. He is best known for his work on the composite Turner City drawings for Turner Construction that have been produced annually since 1910.
He applied from exemption from the draft during the First World War on the basis that he had lost his sight in one eye.
He prepared the Turner City drawings for 1929 to 1962 in succession to Edward W. Spofford. It was a condition of the work that at least two sides of each building be shown and, ideally, with the entrance visible. Mott continued the aerial perspective method used by Richard W. Rummell, the first artist to prepare Turner City, receiving the blueprints months in advance and first making cardboard models of each building on a table to get the scale right. Then, in his studio in a converted garage, with the windows blacked-out, he would photograph the model from a step ladder and draw it in pencil, finishing with an ink wash. The street layout was from Mott's imagination but always different and he included a trademark train in each drawing. Each building was numbered and a key on the reverse gave their real location, apart from during the Second World War when that information was secret.
Around 1939, Mott's depiction of the General Motors' Highways and Horizons building for the 1939 New York World's Fair was shown in the company's publicity brochure for the exhibit. He was also a landscape painter and created an aerial view of Skytop Lodge, Pennsylvania, that adjusted the geography to include all the necessary features and was used for decades as the basis of maps used to orientate visitors to the lodge.
Death and legacy.
Mott died in 1962 from complications during surgery. In 1994, Turner Construction donated the Turner City drawings to the National Building Museum.

Mitochondrial dynamics protein MID49

Mitochondrial elongation factor 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MIEF2 gene.
Function.
This gene encodes an outer mitochondrial membrane protein that functions in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology. It can directly recruit the fission mediator dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) to the mitochondrial surface. The gene is located within the Smith-Magenis syndrome region on chromosome 17. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2011].

Lithocarpus kalkmanii

Lithocarpus kalkmanii is a tree in the beech family Fagaceae. This species is named for the Dutch botanist Cornelis Kalkman.
Description.
"Lithocarpus kalkmanii" grows as a tree up to tall with a trunk diameter of up to . The brownish or greyish bark is cracked or lenticellate. Its coriaceous leaves are tomentose and measure up to long. The dark brown acorns are roundish and measure up to across. This species produces fruits with an 'enclosed receptacle' morphology, where the seed becomes embedded in the basal tissue of the fruit as it develops. This basal material becomes woody, granular and hard and replaces the outer wall of the ovary as the mechanically protective tissue for the seed.
Classification.
This species probably belongs to the subgenus "Eulithocarpus", based on Camus' infrageneric classification system, because of its 'ER' fruit morphology and the few widely spaced concentric lamellae on the cupule.
Distribution and habitat.
"Lithocarpus kalkmanii" is endemic to Borneo where it is known only from Sabah. Its habitat is mixed dipterocarp to montane forests from to altitude.

Elevation (novella)

Elevation is a novella by American author Stephen King, published on October 30, 2018, by Scribner. The book contains chapter-heading illustrations by Mark Edward Geyer, who previously illustrated King's first editions of "Rose Madder" and "The Green Mile".
Background information.
King announced "Elevation" in an interview with "Entertainment Weekly" on December 22, 2017. While talking about his recent novella "Gwendy's Button Box", King said, "I've written another novella called "Elevation", which is also a Castle Rock story and, in some ways, it’s almost like a sequel to "Gwendy". Sometimes you seed the ground, and you get a little fertilizer, and things turn out." A small excerpt as well as the cover for the book were both unveiled by "Entertainment Weekly" on May 29, 2018. Despite King referring to "Elevation" as a novella, the book is billed on the cover as a novel.
Plot details.
In Castle Rock, Maine, Scott Carey faces a mysterious illness which causes bizarre effects on his body and makes him rapidly lose weight, even if he appears healthy on the outside. While battling this disease with his trusted doctor, he also tries fixing a dire situation involving a lesbian couple trying to open a restaurant surrounded by a disapproving public.
Reception.
"Kirkus Reviews" called it "A touching fable with a couple of deft political jabs on the way to showing that it might just be possible for us all to get along."
Film adaptation.
In an interview with "CinemaBlend", filmmaker Jack Bender said he is writing a film adaptation of "Elevation".

Charleston Conservation Park

 
Charleston Conservation Park is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Charleston in the Adelaide Hills state government region about east of the state capital of Adelaide and about north of the town centre in Lobethal.
The conservation park consists of land in section 3943 in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Onkaparinga. It was proclaimed under the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972" on 8 April 1976. As of 2016, it covered an area of .
In 1980, it was described as follows:Charleston Conservation Park preserves a pristine remnant representative of the transition between the wetter stringy bark forests on the western side of the Mount Lofty Ranges and the drier mallee woodlands to the east. A large diversity of flora and fauna are represented in the park including at least seventy-six bird species. An area of gently undulating relief featuring three main woodland associations. These being, a "Casuarina stricta" association with scattered "Eucalyptus leucoxylon" / "E. viminalis", a "E. leucoxylon" association and a "Banksia marginata" association. The understorey is dominated by "Acacia pycnantha" with occasional thickets of "Leptospermum myrsinoides" and "Xanthorrhoea semiplana". Small, regenerating stands of "Acacia melanoxylon" and "Callitris preissii" are of interest. Charleston Conservation Park is in a near pristine condition despite its cultural surrounds, having never been grazed…
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

Chortophaga viridifasciata

Chortophaga viridifasciata, the green-striped grasshopper, is a species of band-winged grasshopper in the family Acrididae. It is found in Central America and North America, ranging from British Columbia to the Gulf of Mexico (mostly east of the Rocky Mountains), south to Costa Rica.
Green-striped grasshoppers inhabit relatively moist areas of short grass, such as roadsides and hay meadows. Their size ranges from 23 to 30 mm for males and 28 to 38 mm for females.
The subspecies "Chortophaga viridifasciata australior" is sometimes listed as a separate species, but it intergrades northward with subspecies "viridifasciata", making species level distinction unlikely.

46th Parliament of Australia

The 46th Parliament of Australia is a meeting of the legislative branch of the Australian federal government, composed of the Australian Senate and the Australian House of Representatives. The parliament was opened on 2 July 2019.
2019 federal election.
House of Representatives.
At the 2019 election, in the 151-seat House of Representatives, the incumbent Coalition government was reelected with 77 seats, a majority of two seats. The Labor opposition won 68 seats. Six other MPs were elected to the crossbench, with the Greens, Centre Alliance, Katter's Australian Party, and independents Andrew Wilkie, Helen Haines and Zali Steggall winning a seat each.
Senate.
In the Senate, 40 of 76 seats were up for election. Following the election, the Coalition had a total of 35 seats, four short of a majority. Labor held 26 seats, the Greens held 9 seats, Centre Alliance and One Nation each held two seats, the Jacqui Lambie Network held one and one seat was held by independent Cory Bernardi, who deregistered the party he was previously a member of on 25 June 2019.
Major events.
March 2020 coronavirus suspension.
Around 23 March 2020, Parliament was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia; an adjournment rather than prorogation. Parliamentary sittings were shut down and scheduled to resume in August. Its committees would continue to operate using technology. This unprecedented move was accompanied by two motions raised by the Attorney-General of Australia, Christian Porter, and passed on 23 March 2020. One motion was designed to allow MPs to participate in parliament by electronic means, if agreed by the major parties and the speaker; the second determined that with the agreement of the two major parties, the standing orders could be amended without requiring an absolute majority. (Shortly before this, a special intergovernmental decision-making forum, the National Cabinet, composed of the head of the Commonwealth (the Prime Minister) and the premiers and chief ministers of the Australian states and territories was established on 18 March 2020 to coordinate the national response to the pandemic.)

The ABFC "Thaiyak" (pronounced “tie-yak”) is a patrol vessel used by the Customs Marine Unit of the Australian Border Force, primarily stationed at the Ashmore and Cartier Islands and is also known as the Long Term Ashmore Capability (LTAC) vessel. Its name, meaning spear, is based on suggestions from Torres Strait Islander crew members who had consulted with their elders.
Construction.
In 2013 Strategic Marine was awarded the contract to build the 40-metre on-station Long Term Ashmore Capability (LTAC) vessel for Gardline Australia Pty Ltd on behalf of the Government of Australia. The vessel was designed by MMD Naval Architectsto provide border protection services in Australia's northern waters therefore to be reliable and flexibly self-sufficient for longterm deployment in tropical regions. The vessel employs a steel hull with aluminium superstructure.
It has medical facilities for first aid along with an isolation facility.
Austere accommodation is provided for up to 24 transportees. In addition, sheltered deck space allows for a short term holding capability for 25 additional passengers.
The vessel was constructed at the Strategic Marine shipyards in Vung Tau, Vietnam and was launched in March 2014.
Operational history.
The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Scott Morrison, attended a naming ceremony for the vessel at Victoria Quay in Fremantle Harbour on 20 June 2014. He said Thaiyak would significantly improve Australia's capability in the detection and response to maritime threats in Australia's northern waters.
The vessel is not armed but carries small arms consisting of Glock pistols for Australian Border Force boarding party officers along with other personal defence equipment on board.

Soriah

Soriah (born Enrique Ugalde, April 1971) is an American overtone singer, performance artist, multi-instrumentalist, and shamanic ritualist headquartered in Portland, Oregon and The Tuvan Republic. His music is a synthesis of traditional forms such as Tuvan throat singing, Shamanic music, Raga, and pre-Columbian Mexica music and language; with avant garde musical styles like Industrial, Ambient, Noise, and Goth. Likewise, his live performance is a fusion of costume and ritual from Tuva, Mexico, North American Native cultures, and Western Ceremonial Magic traditions; as well as chaos magic, butoh, and modern primitive movements of the 20th century. His lyrics, when there are any, are often written in the Nahuatl or traditional Tuvan languages. He won the title of "Best Foreigner" at the 2008 Ustuu-Khuree Festival in Chadanaa Tuva, and in that same year placed as "Third Laureate" at The International Throat Singing Symposium, which remains the highest award given to a non-Tuvan in the history of the Symposium. He also won 2nd Place in the Tuvan Nation Kargyraa Competition in 2014, was given a special award as "Great innovator of the art of Tuvan Throat Singing" in 2016, and won Best Kargyraa Performance at the Khoomei in the Center of Asia Festival 2019. As a solo artist, and with various collaborators and musical ensembles, Soriah has toured throughout the United States, Europe, Asia, and Mexico. He is considered the highest-ranked non-native practitioner of Tuvan throat singing.
Early life and career.
Enrique Ugalde was born in San Bernardino, and moved to Oakland CA at a young age. His father was the drummer for a popular rock and roll band in Mexico called Los Sputniks. As a child, he was exposed to traditional Mesoamerican cultures on frequent family trips to Mexico City with his father, and by his Mexican grandmother. He describes himself as having sung and played guitar in a church choir as a child, begun his study of opera and other Western classical singing shortly thereafter, and being inducted into the State of California Honors Chorus in his high school years. His interest in the "goth" subculture led him to music like Bauhaus, Einsturzende Neubauten, Crash Worship, and Psychic TV; which influenced his shift from classical music to a more experimental and industrial direction. He studied vocal performance at Cal State University Long Beach in 1990 before moving first to Berkeley, then to Oakland. It was in Oakland that he made his first recordings of looped vocals and ambient electronics, which he regards as the roots of the Soriah project. He first invented the name Soriah in early 1995 for the title of a song, "The Course of Soriah." This is the name he gave to his "timeless essence outside the body." In Oakland, he performed with various industrial and experimental music projects, and was known for hosting illegal "Trespass Parties" in abandoned factories and shipyards.
Ugalde relocated to Portland, Oregon in 1996. There he met and studied the Kirana style of raga with famed instructor Michael Stirling, and encountered throat singing for the first time in recordings and a subsequent live show by Huun Huur Tu. He provided percussion, guitar, and vocals for numerous music and performance projects during the late 90s in Portland included Sumerland, Big Milk Bath, Black Orchid, Feral, PANDrogynous Ad Nauseum, Flail, Mesmer; and the collective known alternately as 2Gyrlz and Pan/Zen.
Early Soriah years.
The first public Soriah performances took place in 1999 in Portland, and he quickly achieved renown in the underground arts and music scene. He describes his circle of friends and artists at that time as "neo-tribal." In addition to nightclubs and theaters, early Soriah performances often took place in unconventional locations; such as the underground "shanghai tunnels" of Portland's Oldtown neighborhood, the ruins of the Sutro Baths in San Francisco, in the midst of a citywide protest against George W. Bush in 2005, buried up to his waist in the earth, and half-submerged in a swamp full of frogs on the campus of Reed College. His costumes vary; but often include white make-up or clay accentuated with black lines and fields of color on the face, large headdresses and wide-brimmed hats, ritual robes, and white tulle that obscures facial and bodily features.
During this period, he played with an alternating ensemble of drummers, percussionists, electronic musicians, and dancers including Lana Guerra (aka Power Circus), Stephen Schieberl (aka Let's Go Outside, aka LGO, aka Demogorgon), Ryan Olson, Noah Mickens, Jonathan Howitt, Daniel Henderson, Marshall Serna, Ashkelon Sain, Lucretia Renee, Barrett Clark (aka Sidereal Oscillations), and many others.
Recordings.
Soriah's solo show at The Old Church in Portland featured Soriah accompanying his own vocals on a 20-foot-tall antique pipe organ, and was captured for his first CD release "Chao Organica in A Minor" (2006, Beta-Lactam Ring Records.) His 2007 follow up release on BLR, "Offrendas de Luz a los Muertos", is an extended duet with Lana Guerra playing homemade analog synthesizers that he describes as being his most discordant and intense recording, and also as a "sonic exorcism." A recording from Soriah's 2007 appearance on Bay Area radio station KFJC was released as "Marakame" on Mexican label Ruido Horrible the following year.
In 2009, Soriah signed to Projekt Records and co-produced an album called "Atlan" with Ashkelon Sain of Trance to the Sun, assembling a group of musicians who would form the core of his live ensemble for the next several years (Jonathan Howitt, Daniel Henderson, and Marshall Serna.) He describes this as a return to his roots in both classical and gothic music, after the previous two noise-industrial oriented releases. This ensemble has toured extensively, eventually releasing a second Soriah/Sain album called "Eztica" in 2011.
A number of Soriah recordings have been self-released in digital form since then; including "Asterism" with Barrett Clark (aka Sidereal Oscillations), "Wonderful Disease – The Best of Soriah and LGO", and several others.
Tuva and Uger Khan.
Ugalde first trained with Tuvan masters Chirgilchin at an intensive camp in Sebastapol, California in 2005. They invited him to attend the first International Throat Singing Camp in Tuva in 2007; and he returned in 2008 to participate in the Ustuu-Khuree Festival, where he was awarded the title of "Best Foreigner." He is the only non-Tuvan to have ever placed in the overall competition.
From that point onward, he would split his time as much as possible between Tuva and the US. He has appeared on Tuvan television, taught at a youth music school in the city of Kyzyl, and performed traditional music throughout the country. Aldar Tamdyn, the Tuvan Minister of Culture, granted him the name "Uger Khan," which translates roughly as "Milky Way King." He released an album of traditional Tuvan music under this name in 2013 on Khai-Aat Music, called "Tergiinner Yryzy" or "Songs of the Masters." Since then, he uses Uger Khan to denote his strictly traditional concerts and recordings; and Soriah for his more experimental world fusion music.
Festival appearances.
Soriah has had a presence on the West Coast festival scene for many years and in many forms, including many appearances with the project Liberation Movement. Soriah has performed at The Autonomous Mutant Festival, Burning Man, How to Destroy the Universe, Wave Gotik Treffen in Leipzig Germany 2013, Oregon Eclipse Gathering 2017, and The Symbiosis Gathering.
Collaborations.
Throughout his career, Soriah has maintained a close relationship with the radical arts non-profit 2Gyrlz and the related Pan-Zen Konspiracy Nett-Wyrk. He performed in the 2Gyrlz-produced EnterActive Language Festival in every year of its existence from 2002 to 2005, and in their How to Destroy the Universe event in 2006; and dozens of other shows. Their collaboration has continued with shows in the United Kingdom in 2010, 2011, and 2013.
In addition to those mentioned previously in this article, Soriah has performed or recorded with: Peter Murphy, Liberation Movement, SORNE, Bad Unkl Sista; David J, Dead Voices on Air, Lustmord, Thor &amp; Friends; King Black Acid; Chirgilchin, Societas Insomnia, Bogville, Synchronicity Frequency; cEvin Key, Modest Mouse, The Dandy Warhols, Nachyn and Shonchalai Choduu; Terry Riley, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, Perry Farrell, Mesmer, Mandible Chatter, Akira Kasai, Blixa Bargeld, The Living Jarboe, Psychic TV, Scott Kelly, F-Space, Chrome, Waldteufel, GWAR, Extra Action Marching Band, The Polyphonic Spree, MarchFourth Marching Band, Trance to the Sun, Huun Huur Tu, Chirgilchin, Alash, Yat-Kha, Download, The Dresden Dolls, Everyone Orchestra, P.A.N., Submarine Fleet, ¡Tchkung!, To-Ka-Ge, Sardonik Grin, Death Posture, Children of Paradise, Michael Sakamoto, Yakuza, Riververb, Hop-Frog, Legerdemain, The Moe!kestra!, Degenerate Art Ensemble, Serpentine, The Red King, CoRE, Aixela, and Venerable Showers of Beauty Gamelan.

Personal life.
Enrique Ugalde has a son in Tuva, also named Enrique Ugalde, with a woman named Jamilya Oorzhak. He is a well-known public figure in Portland; where he has often won karaoke contests and awards for Most Popular Cab Driver. He drives for worker-owned local company Radio Cab. He sings and plays guitar in a David Bowie cover band called Blackstar Rising and a Cure cover band called The Xploding Boys, and occasionally performs as pirate character Captain Bootybeard.

Australian Labor Party (Queensland Branch)

The Australian Labor Party (Queensland Branch), commonly known as Queensland Labor or as just Labor inside Queensland, is the state branch of the Australian Labor Party in the state of Queensland. It has functioned in the state since the 1880s.
History.
Trade unionists in Queensland had begun attempting to secure parliamentary representation as early as the mid-1880s. William McNaughton Galloway, the president of the Seamen's Union, mounted an unsuccessful campaign as an independent in an 1886 by-election. A Workers' Political Reform Association was founded to nominate candidates for the 1888 election, at which the Brisbane Trades and Labor Council endorsed six candidates. Thomas Glassey won the seat of Bundamba at that election, becoming the first self-identified "labor" MP in Queensland. The Queensland Provincial Council of the Australian Labor Federation was formed in 1889 in an attempt to unite Labor campaign efforts. Tommy Ryan won the seat of Barcoo for the labour movement-run People's Parliamentary Association in 1892, and the Labor Party was formally established in Queensland following the first Labor-in-Politics Convention later that year.
The Queensland branch subsequently formed the first Labor government in Australia, albeit briefly, when Anderson Dawson took office for a week in 1899 after a falling out between the non-Labor forces.
Since 1989, when the party came back to power after thirty-two years in Opposition, all its leaders have become Premiers despite two spells in Opposition in 1996–98 and 2012–2015.

Chinese city tier system

The Chinese city tier system () is a hierarchical classification of Chinese cities. There are no such official lists in China, as the Chinese government does not publish or recognize an official definition or a list of cities included in the tier system. However, it is frequently referred to by various media publications for purposes including commerce, transportation, tourism, education, and more. Given the rapid development of Chinese cities and the ever-changing dynamic among cities, the tier system has gained wide popularity in recent years as a point of reference. Cities in different tiers reflect differences in consumer behavior, income level, population size, consumer sophistication, infrastructure, talent pool, and business opportunity. The tier system typically includes cities in mainland China only.
Background.
Many economists, consultants and businesses classify cities in China based on the tier system. Businesses frequently refer to the tier system in, for example, devising marketing strategy, as it is understood that treating China as one market is simply not feasible: consumers from different regions and cities have vastly different income levels, behaviors, and trends. Cities in different tiers also differ greatly in population size, infrastructure, and the level of sophistication in products and services.
Given the sheer number of cities in China, there is not a single version of this classification. According to many media publications, it is understood that there are four tiers, and the consensus is that four cities belong to Tier-1 (): Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen (colloquially known as “Bei-Shang-Guang-Shen”, 北上广深). First-tier cities represent the most developed areas of the country with the most affluent and sophisticated consumers. They are large, densely populated urban metropolises that have huge economic, cultural and political influence in China.
Classification.
Yicai Global.
In 2017, "Yicai Global", a financial magazine, published an unofficial tiered list of the "Most Commercially Charming Cities in China", ranking 338 Chinese cities above or at the prefectural level based on the latest business data from 160 commercial brands, customer behavior data from 17 internet companies and Big Data on cities compiled by research institutions. The new ranking assessed the commercial attractiveness of 338 cities drawing from data on five dimensions: (1) concentration of commercial resources, (2) the extent to which a city serves as a commercial hub, (3) vitality of urban residents, (4) diversity of lifestyle, (5) future dynamism. The list below shows Yicai Global's 2017 classification, which contains 338 cities ranked on 6 tiers: tier 1, new tier 1, tier 2, tier 3, tier 4, and tier 5.
It is important to note that a "city" in China may refer to an administrative unit at different levels. In short, while there are 334 prefectural-level units in China, there are 2,851 units at the county level, and 39,864 units at the township level. This list includes only units at the prefectural level, the second highest administrative division in China. A "prefectural-level" administrative unit can be a city, a prefecture, an autonomous prefecture, and a league. The four direct municipalities, Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Tianjin are also considered cities even though they are officially provincial-level administrative units. It is for these reasons that "Yicai Global"'s published list includes 338 "cities": namely all of the 334 prefectural-level units plus the 4 direct municipalities.
South China Morning Post.
An unofficial list published by the "South China Morning Post" ranks 613 Chinese cities on four tiers. This list uses a variety of parameters as the basis of classification: population size, GDP, and administrative hierarchy. According to the "South China Morning Post", the Tier 1 Chinese cities consist of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Chongqing.
Criticism.
Some argue that the tier system limits opportunities for cities that are not ranked among higher tiers. Robert Lawrence Kuhn, an American investment banker and author of "How China’s Leaders Think", argues that the so-called “second-tier” cities should actually be called “first-class opportunities,” given that these cities have been growth engines of the Chinese economy, boosted by huge amounts of investment, new infrastructure and an influx of new talent. Kuhn says that "roughly 170 Chinese cities have more than one million residents, but only five – Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou and Shenzhen – are considered “first-tier” in terms of size and per capita Gross Domestic Product. Some of these metropolises have populations that exceed that of many countries and are world-class in every way."

Volkswagen Group MEB platform

The Volkswagen Group MEB platform (; English: "modular electric-drive toolkit") is a modular car platform for electric cars developed by the Volkswagen Group and its subsidiaries. It is used in models of Audi, SEAT, Škoda and Volkswagen. The architecture is aimed to "consolidate electronic controls and reduce the number of microprocessors, advance the application of new driver-assistance technology and somewhat alter the way cars are built" by the VW Group.
Plans.
The MEB platform is part of a Volkswagen strategy to start production of new battery electric vehicles between 2019 and 2025. In 2017, the VW Group announced a gradual transition from combustion engine to battery electric vehicles with all 300 models across 12 brands having an electric version by 2030.
As of May 2018, the VW Group had committed in electric-vehicle batteries supplies and announced plans to outfit 16 factories to build electric cars by the end of 2022. The Volkswagen-branded production cars started to be assembled in VW's Zwickau plant in Germany for the European market at the end of 2019, while two plants in North America and China started production in 2020 and Chattanooga, Tennessee in 2022. The Škoda-branded SUV Vision E is produced in the Škoda plant in Mladá Boleslav, Czech Republic, along with electric motors and electric car batteries.
, two types of the MEB platform were slated to be developed: one for passenger vehicles and one for utility automobiles that accommodate heavier cargo. VW also stated that the platform would be available for procurement to competitor manufacturers.
Ford Motor Company has a strategic partnership with Volkswagen for the MEB platform to benefit from economies of scale. Ford plans to build MEB cars by 2023.

Enterprise Singapore

Enterprise Singapore (abbreviation: ESG) is a statutory board under the Ministry of Trade and Industry of the Singapore Government. It was formed on 1 April 2018 to support Singapore small and medium enterprise (SMEs) development, upgrade capabilities, innovate, transform, and internationalise. It also supports the growth of Singapore as a trading and startup hub, and continues to be the national standards and accreditation body.
History.
Enterprise Singapore was formed through the merger of International Enterprise Singapore (IE) and SPRING Singapore. It is an integration of IE Singapore and SPRING Singapore’s functions. SPRING Singapore was responsible for helping startups and SMEs in financing, capability and management development, technology and innovation. It was the national body for standards and accreditation, responsible for helping companies achieve international standards and conformity requirements.
International Enterprise Singapore promoted international trade and helped Singapore companies expand internationally.
On February 5, the Singapore Parliament passed a bill to officiate the new statutory board. During the second reading that occurred on the same day, Minister for Trade and Industry S Iswaran said "the goals of capacity building, innovation and international expansion are deeply intertwined and reinforced one another. A company must innovate and deepen its capabilities to successfully expand into overseas markets. Equally, venturing overseas will itself create the scale, impetus and opportunity for businesses to gain new capabilities and expertise… so it is necessary and timely to merge the functions and operations of IE and SPRING to form Enterprise Singapore".

Berthe Fraser

Berthe Fraser (née Vicogne; 1894–1956) was a French Resistance agent who fought the Germans and helped more than 100 allied airmen escape during the Second World War. She spent two years of the war in prison, in one case being tortured for 28 days. She was awaiting execution by the Gestapo in September 1944 but was saved by Allied soldiers who drove away her captors.
As a result of her actions and "acts of great bravery", she was awarded medals from France, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Fraser married a British soldier in 1919 after he served in the First World War. They settled in Arras, France.
Second World War.
The start of the war saw Fraser running a perfume shop in Arras. She and her husband stayed in France when the Germans invaded in May 1940. Since he was British, he was interned soon after the invasion.
Fraser soon created her own underground network to smuggle out British and other allied airmen who had been shot down. The Special Operations Executive, otherwise known as the SOE, was the British organisation that was tasked to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance in occupied Europe. With the success of her network, Fraser was approached by SOE agents for help. Continuing her role in smuggling airmen to safety, she also helped agents move about in Northern France. In addition, she stored explosives and weapons for the resistance, helped provide intelligence on German positions and movements, and carried messages. She was noted for doing any task that was asked of her.
She was arrested in 1941 and sent to prison in Belgium. During her interrogation, she started providing misleading information that seemed true enough that the Gestapo had to check out the details. In December 1942, after 15 months, she was released as she was considered a "burden on resources". She quickly resumed her previous activities.
She helped F. F. E. Yeo-Thomas, celebrated agent of the SOE, escape by hiding him in a hearse during a mock funeral to evade detection. Flowers around the coffin covered Yeo-Thomas as he was taken to an empty field that was large enough to land a plane to pick him up. The local undertaker provided flowers and steaks to add to the illusion that a funeral was happening. Armed farmers and resistance fighters, their protection arranged by Fraser, guarded the field. Before Yeo-Thomas left, he was provided with wine, cheese, and other products they feared were not available in Britain. The resistance, in return, asked for weapons, and other items that they could use for their operations. Yeo-Thomas was carrying details of the V1 and V2 rocket program with him.
Fraser was captured again in February 1944, after being betrayed by a British agent. She was tortured for 28 days and locked in solitary confinement for six months. The Gestapo wanted her to provide details about her activities and other members of the resistance. By May 1944 she had been sentenced to be executed, but was saved by Allied soldiers who freed her from the prison.
After the war.
Fraser was awarded seven medals from several allied countries after the war. In 1990, the Imperial War Museum purchased her medals for $28,500.
Fraser died in 1956. She never fully recovered from her month-long torture.

Asaichi

 is a Japanese weekday morning talk program airing on NHK General Television, hosted by Naoko Suzuki and Hanamaru-Daikichi Hakata. It airs weekdays from 8:15a.m.JST to 9:54a.m.JST.
History.
"Asaichi" started on March 29, 2010, evolving from NHK General Television's original morning information program "Seikatsu Hot Morning". Yumiko Udo, the-then NHK Announcer, and Yoshihiko Inohara, a member of V6, one of Japan's popular pop groups, hosted this program from the first run.
Targeting mainly at women in their 40s, this program dealt with a wide variety of themes, from information about health and money, cooking tips and living improvement tips, to infertility problems, menopausal disorders and the problem of sexless relationships.
In April 2018, Hanamaru-Daikichi Hakata and Yurie Omi took over the job of the main presenters from Udo and Inohara.
On February 10, 2021, NHK announced that Yurie Omi would be stepping down from the main presenter at the end of March because she would be leaving NHK, and handing over her job to NHK Announcer Naoko Suzuki. Hanamaru-Daikichi Hakata will be remaining their posts.
Format.

Benny Kuriakose

Benny Kuriakose (born 25 May 1962) was born in Kerala, India. He made his mark in architectural conservation and the design of new buildings, taking his roots from the vernacular architecture of South India. He is known for designing structures which are built from natural materials such as timber, stone and brick. He has practiced mostly in Chennai and Kerala. He runs a consultancy firm in Chennai.
Early life and education.
Kuriakose was born in Koothattukulam and brought up in Thiruvananthapuram. There he attended the Government Model High School before joining the Government Arts College for his Pre-Degree course. He then attended the College of Engineering, Trivandrum, where he took a basic degree in Civil Engineering. In 1986, he received the Charles Wallace India Trust Award for a master's degree in Conservation Studies from the Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies at the University of York, in the UK. He completed a doctoral degree at the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras in 2015. Kuriakose is married to Dr. Milly Mathew and has two children. His son, Kevin Kuriakose is an architect settled in Denmark and daughter, Dr. Eileen Kuriakose
Career.
In 1984, as a recent graduate of the College of Engineering, Trivandrum, he started practicing architecture after a chance meeting with British-born, Indian architect Laurie Baker. After working with him for nine months, he started his own practice in 1985. During his early career as a self-taught architect, he worked with several organizations such as the Integrated Rural Technology Centre, Palakkad, the Centre of Science and Technology for Rural Development (COSTFORD) and Kerala State Nirmithi Kendra for the development of alternative, low-cost and eco-friendly architecture. From 1985 onwards, he built low-cost houses that mirrored Baker's style, until in 1992 he built the house of actor Mammootty.
In 1994, Kuriakose was commissioned by Malayala Manorama to design housing for the village of Banegaon after the 1993 Latur earthquake. He also designed the layout of public and residential buildings in the village of Chapredi for the Earth Quake Rehabilitation Project, Bhuj District, Gujarat State, 2002.
He has been visiting faculty at the School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi, the Indian Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institutes of Management and other architecture schools.
Kuriakose was awarded the "Inside Outside" Designer of the Year 2001 for the weekend retreat in Chennai, and in 2011, the Celebration of Architecture Award from "Inside Outside" magazine. In 2016, he was conferred with the 2016 Estrade Lifetime Achievement Award (the previous recipient of this honor, in 1980, was Architect Karan Grover). He was also listed as one of the top 10 Indian architects who is harnessing traditional wisdom to build homes of the future.
He has written books such as "Conserving of Timber Structures in India" and "Post Tsunami Reconstruction: Manual for Supervisors and Project Staff". He is one of the editors of the book "Guidelines for the Preparation of a Heritage Management Plan" published by INTACH.
Kuriakose has offered his services as a consultant to UNDP, UNESCO, various State Governments and other organizations. He has also presented many papers on Housing, Conservation and Cost–Effective Building Techniques in various seminars, conferences and workshops in India and abroad.
Architectural Style.
Kuriakose seeks to achieve sustainable architecture through vernacular and traditional practices. He believes in the logic behind vernacular architecture being climate responsive, and using locally available materials to create projects that have a simplistic beauty. Sustainability and cost-effectiveness form the most important factors in arriving at the final design.
He tries to explore an architecture that is appropriate to the environment, cost-effective, sustainable and at the same incorporates the principles of vernacular architecture in the modern context. Tradition and heritage is not used as a style, but more as a concept. Vernacular architecture to him is more like a depository of knowledge. Society ad technology has undergone many changes, so it is for architects to look at these and then derive a different kind of vocabulary in architecture. Kuriakose tries to design for the client in such a way that there is constant dialogue between them, each affecting the other in various ways, leading to and influencing the final design of the building. This leads the design to progress and clarify as it is continually revised in the light of the constant and evolving interpretations of the parameters. This leads to a final design that is unique and caters to the user.
Kuriakose does not have a style of his own. He thinks the concept is much more important than the style in design. He does not want to impose his ideas onto the buildings he designs. He designs each building according to each one's needs. All his projects look different because each homeowner has preferences and he tries to respond to their aspirations. The location is different, the climate is different, the materials are different and the clients are also different. He thinks that style is very superficial.
The sustainability aspects of his buildings varies. Although modern materials such as cement and steel are used, their use is limited and it is mostly natural materials that are prominent in his buildings.
The answers to what makes a sustainable building vary, depending on physical factors such as climate, land availability, local building materials and social and cultural factors.
Courtyards, verandahs, and roofs are some of the elements Kuriakose uses in the design of buildings. Kerala, where he grew up, and Tamil Nadu where he has spent the last 25 years of his life have influenced him.
According to Kuriakose, the biggest challenge in the building industry today is to ensure the quality of construction. Everybody is interested in quantity and if the quality of construction cannot be ensured, the buildings will not last for long.
Dakshinachitra craft village.
Since 1995, Kuriakose has been involved in continuing and developing the design of DakshinaChitra Craft Village near Chennai based on the original site plan and sketches by Laurie Baker. Baker's sketches were translated into plans by him. In 1996, he moved to Chennai where he was commissioned to do the Kerala Section and the Public Buildings in DakshinaChitra.
Tharangambadi and Chinnangudi tsunami rehabilitation project.
Kuriakose went on to design more than 1,000 individualized homes for fisherfolk in Tharangambadi and Chinnangudi villages in Nagapattinam, under the Tsunami Rehabilitation Project. The basic ideology of the project was to provide houses for the victims of the 2004 tsunami, which hit the east coast of India. Generally, in public housing programs in India and elsewhere, a single type design is used for the construction of all of the houses.
In the case of the tsunami reconstruction project carried out by the NGO South Indian Federation of Fishermen Societies (SIFFS), a novel idea of involving the house owner in the design and construction of the house was tried out. Plots were allotted before the construction of the houses so that each house owner knew which house they would get.
In the design of the houses and the settlement of Tharangambadi and Chinnankudi affected by the tsunami, it was decided to make sure that the community and home owners participated in the rebuilding. Different models were offered and model homes were built so that people could understand what they were actually going to get. The sites were allocated to individuals before starting the construction itself. The houses were highly customized and the home owners had control over the construction process.
Muziris heritage project.
Kuriakose was selected as conservation consultant for the Muziris Heritage Project in 2007. Muziris is not just a place. It is a concept and the project was an attempt to educate future generations about heritage, and to throw light on Kerala’s pan-Indian and international trade links. The project's artifacts and monuments are spread out over an area of 150 km2, and Kuriakose's team has located clusters, including 400 buildings of historic importance and architectural interest.
It is an alternate approach to heritage management, and the biggest challenge was to develop a concept which suits the local context. The Muziris Heritage Project has many dimensions. It is an educational project, a developmental project and a model for sustainable tourism. The project was the brainchild of Dr. Thomas Isaac, who had grown up in the area. An economics professor from the Centre for Development Studies, he became the finance minister of Kerala in 2006. He envisioned Muziris as a non-formal education project for future generations.
The project involved the conservation of Paliam Palace, Paravur Synagogue, Kottappuram Fort, Kottappuram Market and many other historic structures in the Muziris area It has set a precedent in India for adopting an integrated approach to heritage conservation and regional development. The project also envisages features such as interactive museums, visitor centres, a virtual reconstruction centre, facilities to travel by boat on the River Periyar to various monuments, cycle tours of the area and circuit tours, to name a few. Floated in 2008, it is India's largest conservation project, spread over 25 sites, and links Kerala's histories of Dutch, Arabic, Chinese, Jewish, Greek, Portuguese and Roman roots in the forgotten port of Muziris from 1st Century BC onward.
The restoration of Cheraman Juma Mosque, the oldest mosque in India, removing all the modern appendages is an offshoot of the Muziris Heritage Project. The decision to replace the new chapel in the Kottappuram market with the old was taken by the congregation. The mosque and chapel are just two of the structures that are being transformed as a result of this initiative, coming up in a 150 square km area in central Kerala, in Ernakulam and Thrissur districts.
When the project is completed, it will be a walk through 3,000 years of history of the southern Indian state of Kerala. The place is very special since this is where Jews, Arabs, Greeks, Portuguese, Dutch and the British etc. came together. Three religions came to India through this port namely Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
The Muziris Heritage Project set a precedent in India for adopting an integrated approach to heritage conservation and regional development.

Brinolfo Algotsson

Brinolfo Algotsson ( – 6 February 1317) was a Swedish Catholic prelate and theologian who served as the Bishop of Skara from 1278 until his death. He was descended from nobles and studied for almost two decades in Paris at the college there before returning to his homeland as a dean and canon prior to his episcopal nomination. He was diligent in his work in reforming the education of schools and the overall reorganization of his episcopal see. He was forced into a brief exile (with his father and some brothers imprisoned or killed in that time) but was able to continue his work upon his return.
Upon his death he was known to be hailed as a saint with dozens of miracles reported both during and after his life with some reported at the site of his tomb in the diocesan cathedral. There were several processes and commissions set up to collect testimonies and documents to support his cause for canonization with an appeal made to the Council of Constance to declare him as such; canonization did not occur during the council, but Pope Martin V encouraged and endorsed the cause. Pope Innocent VIII approved for his relics to be translated which occurred during the pontificate of his successor Pope Alexander VI on 16 August 1492 which acted as a "de facto" canonization despite the fact no formal canonization was celebrated despite attempts to convince the pontiff to do so.
Life.
Brinolfo Algotsson was born in the 1240s or 1230s - but no later than 1248 - in Västergötland as the second of eight sons born to the nobleman Algot Brinolfsson (1220-1302) and Margareta Petersdotter (b. 1235). His siblings were:
He was educated in the cathedral school in Skara before being sent to pursue ecclesial studies in Paris at the college there for almost two decades where he heard the Dominican friar Thomas Aquinas give lectures. He became noted for his extensive learning as well as his background in canon law and overall theological studies. He also underwent philosophical studies and science while at the college. Upon his return to his homeland he was ordained to the priesthood and appointed as the dean for the Linköping chapter and the canon for Skara prior to being appointed as the Bishop of Skara in 1278 which Pope Nicholas III confirmed; he later received his episcopal consecration as a bishop around that time. He was enthroned in his episcopal see in the spring of 1279 and began his mission to renew his diocese. In 1281 he issued a charter which governed various tithes in addition to fining fellow prelates for various crimes committed should guilt be determined.
The bishop became active in the nation's political life and worked hard to ensure that the needs and the teachings of the Church became an integral focus of all public policies put forth. He also supported the work of the missionaries who had come to his diocese and the nation in general. Algotsson wrote various and extensive theological works in addition to poems for particular liturgical feasts. He created a special house in Paris for students from Skara. But his work soon ran afoul of the absolutist King Magnus Ladulas in 1288 which prompted him to flee into a brief exile to escape the monarch's retribution. His exile saw his father imprisoned and some brothers of his either killed or imprisoned. But the persecution of his house came in 1289 when he and the king were reconciled which allowed for Algotsson to return to Skara to continue his work uninterrupted.
In 1304 he oversaw a thorn from Jesus Christ's Crown of Thorns brought to the Skara diocese from Lödöse due to close ties he shared with Norwegian prelates. This had been cultivated since the 1280s after he helped in the financing of the reconstruction of the Stavanger Cathedral which had been devastated in a fire. On 2 September 1304 he greeted a Norwegian ship holding 2000 people and was presented with the thorn which was carried in solemn procession to the diocesan cathedral. This made his diocese a pilgrim destination that also generated revenue which Algotsson hoped to use to renovate the diocesan cathedral. He made 2 September the feast for the relic's reception and later wrote the "Historia de Spinea Corona" in order to describe how the thorn was gifted to his diocese.
The bishop became noted in life for having performed several miracles such as that it was said he turned water into wine on several occasions, much like Jesus Christ had done at the wedding in Cana.
He died in 1317 and his remains were interred in the Skara Cathedral. Bridget of Sweden visited his tomb on 2 February 1349 and there received a vision that revealed to her the holiness of the late bishop. In her vision she saw the Blessed Mother and Jesus Christ who also pointed out Algotsson's holiness to her, for she also saw bishop Brynolf in her vision.
Sainthood.
King Erik of Pomerania appointed a commission in Skara in 1417 to collect documentation and testimonies (over 50 in total) needed for the late bishop with the cause being entrusted at some later point to Swedish monks who did additional research on the bishop's life and miracles; permission had been granted on 27 April 1416 for the process to be held which took place from 12 April 1417 until that 28 April. In 1414 the Archbishop of Uppsala Johannes Haquini and three other bishops (in addition to the Bishop of Lund Peder Kruse and the Bishop of Nidaros Eskil) wrote an application to the Council of Constance asking that he be canonized. Pope Martin V confirmed the cause would continue and provided his encouragement as to the cause's continuation. There were 34 miracles recorded between 1404 and 1417 either in Skara or Lödöse as the process determined.
In 1492 additional documentation was collected for submission to Pope Innocent VIII with the intention of having Algotsson canonized in 1498. But Innocent VIII's death in 1492 hindered this to a significant degree. But Innocent VIII had given permission not long before his death for Algotsson's relics to be translated and a liturgical feast in his name affixed to that date. This took place during the pontificate of his successor Pope Alexander VI on 16 August 1492 (who had just been elected a week prior) which acted as a sort of "de facto" canonization even though no formal sanctification was celebrated and no official papal bull subscribed.
Hemming Gadd - on the behalf of Sten Sture the Elder - spoke to Pope Alexander VI on the subject of the canonization of the bishop and told the pontiff that it would be good for the Swedish church for four Swedish Blesseds such as Hemming of Turku to be canonized. This request was repeated in 1499 since no progress had been made and on 16 March 1499 the pope granted permission for a second translation of relics. This never occurred.

Fritz Huber (engineer)

Fritz Huber (1881-1942) was a German mechanical engineer and designer of the Lanz Bulldog tractor.
Biography.
Fritz Huber was born on 8 March 1881 in Wasserburg am Inn. He came from an old family of engineers. In Munich, he first attended the industrial school, then he began studying at the local technical college. He successfully completed his studies in 1903 and went on to work in France and Switzerland. After his return to Germany, he got a job at the Grade company in Magdeburg, where he devoted himself to the construction of high-quality two-stroke engines. He also built the first hot-bulb engines at the Climax plant in Vienna and improved their running characteristics with adjustable injectors and improved mass balance. On 20 September 1916, he obtained employment with Heinrich Lanz AG in Mannheim. He constructed gasoline-powered tractors for the German army in the First World War. Between 1918 and 1921 he developed a single-cylinder hot-bulb engine for stationary work. This engine was later used in the Lanz Bulldog, the first German heavy-oil tractor in mass production. Because of the First World War, the testing of the concept had to be postponed but, from 1920, the development and construction of the Bulldog got under way. The tractor got its name because of its external resemblance to a bulldog and Fritz Huber is considered the "Father of the Bulldogs". In 1942, Huber retired because of illness. He died on 14 April 1942 in Mannheim.

Semnan Space Center

 
 Semnan Space Center (Persian:) is the primier Iranian Space Center, located 50 km southeast of the city of Semnan in the north of the country.
History.
Media attention on the space center began when Iranian authorities announced their intent to launch an artificial satellite within weeks on 16 August 2008. On 17 August 2008, Iran proceeded, as preannounced, with the second test launch of a three stage Safir SLV from a site south of Semnan in the northern part of the Dasht-e-Kavir desert. Reza Taghizadeh, head of the Iranian Aerospace Organization, told state television "The Safir (Ambassador) satellite carrier was launched today and for the first time we successfully launched a dummy satellite into orbit". As reported in late 2009 and early 2010, a new, larger launch pad was under construction at .

The main launch Platform ([[Imam Khomeini Space Launch Terminal]]) is located at the east of the complex on a specially enclosed octagonal area measuring 900 x 660 m and covering an area of 51.4 ha, representing the largest single element of the new space center. The units are accessed by a road from the northwest, which is within the perimeter of the three rays and forms two main inner zones – almost completely built lower and newly initiated upper (state of 2015). The lower zone consists of spacious launching platforms with towers and four larger compartments for installation and storage.

Taiporoporo / Charles Sound

Taiporoporo / Charles Sound is a fiord of the South Island of New Zealand. It is one of the fiords that form the coast of Fiordland. 
Geography.
&lt;mapframe text="Taiporoporo / Charles Sound" width=260 height=300 zoom=9 latitude=-45.05 longitude=167.08&gt;
&lt;/mapframe&gt;
The fiord is located between Taitetimu / Caswell Sound and Hinenui / Nancy Sound, on the central Fiordland coast. It is 14 kilometres in length, and extends in a roughly northwestern direction. In its upper reaches the fiord splits into two arms of similar length, the Emelius Arm (to the north) and the Gold Arm (to the south). The Gold Arm is protected by the Kahukura (Gold Arm) Marine Reserve. Other parts of the fiord are included in the Taumoana (Five Fingers Peninsula) Marine Reserve.
The Irene and Windward Rivers flow respectively into the ends of the Emelius and Gold Arms. The short Juno River enters to Tasman Sea just to the north of the fiord's mouth.
Several small islands are located within the fiord, including Catherine Island and Fanny Island in the Gold Arm and Eleanor Island at the mouth of the Emelius Arm.
History.
Charles Sound was known as Charlie's Sound during the early to mid-19th century. It was very probably named after Charles MacLaren, the captain of the "Sydney Cove", a sealing boat that visited the sound in 1810. In October 2019, the name of the fiord was officially altered to Taiporoporo / Charles Sound.
2003 tsunami.
During the magnitude 7.0 23 August 2003 Fiordland earthquake, a significant landslide swept into Charles Sound causing a 4- to 5-metre high tsunami that damaged a wharf and helipad in the sound.

Maria Andreu

Maria Mestre de los Dolores Andreu (April 25, 1801after 1860) was an American known as the first US Coastguard female employee. A lighthouse keeper, she was the first Hispanic-American woman to command a federal shore installation. Marilyn Dykman said of her "Maria Andreu's leadership and perseverance as keeper of the lighthouse inspired generations of women to shine as female employees within federal service through her beacon of light."
Early life.
Andreu was born on April 25, 1801 to parents Bartholomew Mestre and Marianna Lorenzo Mestre, and baptized on April 30 of the same year. She married Joseph Juan Andreu on May 6, 1822; Joseph Andreu served as keeper of the St. Augustine Lighthouse from 1854–1859. The couple had eight children.
Career.
Andreu was the first Hispanic woman to serve in the Coast Guard and the first to command a federal shore installation. She became keeper of the lighthouse on January 7, 1860, after her husband Joseph, who had been the lighthouse keeper since 1854, died. According to a report in the St. Augustine Examiner on December 10, 1859, he was whitewashing the tower when the scaffolding collapsed and he fell about 60 feet onto the roof of the building where oil for the light was stored. Joseph Andreu was a cousin of the first St. Augustine lighthouse keeper, Juan Andreu, who served from 1824-1845. Joseph's father, Tomas, was the brother of Juan's father, Antonio.
Maria served as keeper at a salary of $400 a year until 1861, when the light was ordered darkened by the then Confederate States Secretary of the Navy, Stephen Mallory, and George C. Gibbs. She is believed to have left St. Augustine and moved to Georgia, where she spent the rest of her life in obscurity.

Andy J. Davies

Andrew James "Andy J." Davies (born 22 March 1966), is a British musician, songwriter, audio engineer, and record producer. He was a member and main songwriter of late 1980s glam punk band Soho Roses. He produced music for various bands, including SMASH. He is the co-founder and owner of "Damajive Studios", co-owner of "Earthworks Studios", and the founder and owner of the current studio and production companies "The Analogue Room" and "Damage Recordings".
Early years.
Classically tutored from an early age, Davies formed his first band White Lie with school friends at age 12, and recorded for the first time at age 13 at The Crypt recording studio in Stevenage, UK. The band went on to enter and reach the regional finals of the TSB School Rock competition held at the Shaw Theatre Euston road in 1981. Later, the band morphed into The Gunrunners featuring guitarist (later of SMASH) Edward Borrie and Simon Coxhill, son of Jazz saxophonist Lol Coxhill. After the breakup of the band in 1986, Davies replied to an advertisement in "Melody Maker" and completed the lineup of London band The V2's which in 1987 became The Soho Roses.
Damajive Studios.
After a short career with Soho Roses in the late 80s, Davies opened Damajive Studios in Hitchin, Hertfordshire in 1991.
During this time, he recorded for numerous local bands, notably SMASH's "Spring 1994" mini album, including the double A side "Lady, Love Your Cunt"/"Shame", King Rizla's seminal 1994 album "Time For A New Day" and the Guns n' Wankers LP "For Dancing And Listening", released on Fat Wreck Chords. In 1995, due to SMASH's notoriety as an independent band, "Shame" appeared on the EMI compilation "Unlaced". The studio remained open until 1996. While doing live sound at a local venue, he continued to record bands in his private analogue studio. He also produced Gilla Bruja's first two albums "Tooth and Nail" (2002) and "Six Fingered Jesus" (2003). He played bass at a number of shows with the band following the release of "6 Finger Jesus". During this time, he also formed a post-punk hardcore band called Bad Head, singing and playing guitar.
Earthworks Studios.
In 2002, he was asked to become co-owner of the long-established London studio Earthworks. While there, Davies produced several notable and critically acclaimed records including The Freaks Union's 3rd Album "Songs From Despair", Deadline's 4th album "Take A Good Look" (2006) and the studio tracks for their 5th album 'We're Taking Over', and The Mercury League's album "La Libertad No Es Un Show". In 2006, Davies recorded UK black metal band Niroth's self titled album.
Also in 2006, he recorded vocals for the Paul Di'Anno album "The Beast Live".
In 2007, Davies produced death metal band "Corpsing" second album "'The Stench of Humanity"' mixed and mastered in his private studio "The Shed", which is where his analogue equipment was stored during his time at Earthworks. In 2008, the same system was used to produce Polish death metal band Diachronia's "Chaos Eternal" LP, as well as work on CJ &amp; The Satellites' album "Thirteen", The Metatrons' "Patterns of Chaos" album, and James and Alex Bay's Roadrunner's independently released self titled album among others.
In 2009, Davies produced Aghast!'s well-reviewed first EP "Afterlife Crisis" (which also appeared on a metal hammer CD). In 2009, Bad Head independently released a self-titled album. They subsequently played at the BBC Rhythms of The World festival in 2010. Davies parted company with Earthworks in 2011.
The Analogue Room.
In 2013, Davies restored his classic recording equipment and set up an entirely analogue studio. Over the next couple of years, the infrastructure and equipment in the studio were expanded and improved, including the acquisition of several vintage tape recorders and the integration of digital systems into the studio. During this time, Andy produced several notable recordings, including The Zipheads "Prehistoric Beat" (2013) album, Nick And The Sun Machine's album "Wide Lying Smiles" (2014) and The Metatrons "Please Mister / Not Today" (2014) single. In 2013, Davies produced the new SMASH mini album "Spring '13", a reworking of material from their earlier collaborations, including an updated version of their hit single "(I Want To) Kill Somebody 2014" at the same time as recording the "Without Regret" mini album which he also produced and engineered.
Damage Recordings.
In 2016, Davies decided to expand from the analogue purist approach and return to a more modern recording ethos, while keeping the analogue facility intact and using hardware and software together in the form of Damage Recordings. The facility is complete and Davies is working on several projects. In this facility, he recently produced early demos for Dark Asphyxia's 2016 EP "Executioner and subsequently, in 2018, their single 'Bury The Sun'. The first release from Davies' collaboration with ex Rubicon Vocalist Andy Delany was released in the form of the first Delany album 'Mission Creep', followed by a few shows with the group around the UK in 2019" In 2018, Davies produced "BrainPain", an EP by punk metal band HeadAche and 'Sex Dictator,' the first single for heavy rock band Dirty Ol' Crow. In 2019, he also recorded and produced the second Dirty 'Ol Crow single 'Johnny Boy' and their debut album 'Stranger's Nest.' 2019 also saw Davies remaster all of the Guns 'N' Wankers back catalogue for re release and record and produce the debut single for The Best Medicine, a heavy rock band featuring ex members of Aghast.
Controversies.
Davies' band Soho Roses was known as a rebellious glam punk act. After a gig supporting Teenage Idols at the Marquee Club in 1988, Steevi Jaimz of Tigertailz allegedly attempted to punch a member of the Soho Roses' entourage, triggering a notorious fight that resulted in Jaimz being ejected from the club. In a photograph taken by Ray Palmer used in an interview in "Metal Hammer" in November 1988, there is a copy of Guns N' Roses "Appetite for Destruction" LP featuring a prominent plastic dog turd, sparking a heated readers vs band debate in the next few issues of the magazine.
Davies worked closely with the band Guns n' Wankers, featuring ex-members of Soho Roses. The band's name was a blatant reference to their dislike of the LA glam metal scene demonstrated in the classic "Metal Hammer" interview.
Although correctly credited on the independent pressings, Davies' work on SMASH's "Spring 1994" mini album and "Lady Love Your Cunt" /"Shame 7" single was misquoted on the UK pressing on Virgin's Hi-Rise Recordings label due to a clerical error. However, Davies was correctly credited on the U.S. Hut Recordings release and all subsequent reissues of the material.

Alec Potts (born 19 February 1996) is an Australian competitive archer. Potts made history at the 2016 Summer Olympics by bagging the country's first ever medal with a bronze in the men's team recurve.
Potts was selected to compete for the Australian squad at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, shooting in both individual and team recurve tournaments. First, he recorded 666 points, 37 perfect tens, and 13 bull's eyes to take the twentieth seed heading to the knockout draw from the classification round, along with his team's cumulative score of 2,005. Sitting at fourth to move directly through the quarterfinals in the men's team recurve, Alec and his compatriots Ryan Tyack and London 2012 Olympian Taylor Worth confidently beat the Frenchmen with a 5–3 for the semifinals, before they were soundly beaten by the tournament favorites South Korea in straight sets (0–6). Bouncing back from their semifinal loss, the Australian trio held off a late reaction from China in the bronze medal match (6–2) to secure the country's first ever Olympic podium finish in a team archery event. In the men's individual recurve, Potts was unable to overcome local archer Bernardo Oliveira by the loud applause of the parochial crowd in the opening round, thereby eliminating him from the tournament 4–6.

St Clere, Kent

St Clere is a Grade I listed 17th-century country house in Kemsing, Kent, England. 
The house is built in brick in three storeys plus basement and attic. It has a five bay front facade with a 19th-century central porch and a parapet. The high pitched hipped slated roof is surmounted by a row of linked tall brick chimneys. Extensions have been built to the side. Within the house is a chimneypiece by Sir John Soane, which was brought from the old Bank of England.
History.
In the 13th century the property was known as Aldham and owned by a family of the same name, later passing to the St Clere family. Aldham became Aldham St Cleres and eventually St Cleres. The St Clere family died out in the 1400s and the estate was acquired by Henry Lovell, who built a new house there. In 1625 it passed to Sir John Sedley, 2nd Baronet (of Great Chart), who built the present house. By the death of the 4th baronet in 1702 the house was somewhat neglected and was sold to William Glanville, MP (formerly William Evelyn), High Sheriff of Kent for 1757.
The house passed down in the Evelyn family via William Evelyn, MP and his son-in-law Alexander, who took the surname Evelyn and was High Sheriff of Kent for 1816. He left it to a cousin Lt-Col William John Evelyn, who rarely used the house and occasionally rented it out and in 1878 it was finally sold to Sir Mark Wilks Collet, Bt., a London merchant and later a Governor of the Bank of England.
Collet carried out a series of renovations to the buildings and grounds, as did his son and successor Sir Mark Edlman Collet. When the latter moved abroad in 1935 the estate passed to Montagu Norman, 1st Baron Norman, in whose family it remains.
"The Mirror Crack'd", a 1980 British mystery film directed by Guy Hamilton based on Agatha Christie's thriller used the house as its main location. It stars Angela Lansbury as Miss Marple, Kim Novak, Elizabeth Taylor, Geraldine Chaplin, Tony Curtis, Edward Fox, Rock Hudson.

Mary Thomas (labor leader)

Mary Thomas, known as Queen Mary, (ca. 1848–1905) was one of the leaders of the 1878 "Fireburn" labor riot, or uprising, on the island of St. Croix in the Danish West Indies.
Mary Thomas was from Antigua and arrived in St. Croix in the 1860s to take work on the plantations in the island. In 1878 she resided at the Sprat Hall plantation. She had three children but never married. Before the uprising, she had been sentenced for theft and for mistreating her children. Historians have suggested that such sentences were used by the authorities to discredit people who opposed the authorities.
After the 1848 emancipation of enslaved Africans in the Danish West Indies, an 1849 labor law fixed salaries and labor conditions for all plantation workers and prohibited bargaining for better wages or work conditions. This made plantation work unattractive, and many workers opted to leave the plantations and the islands to seek better conditions elsewhere. The government reacted to the labor shortage by making it harder to for workers to leave the islands, demanding health certificates and charging fees for passports. When wages were to be negotiated in the fall of 1878, the workers' demands were denied, and new harsh conditions for traveling were imposed. This sparked the so-called Fireburn riots, which have been called the largest labor riot in Danish history, during which more than 50 plantations were burned.
Because of her role as a leader during the uprising, Mary Thomas came to be known as "Queen Mary". The workers chose her and two other women, "Queen Agnes" and "Queen Matilda", as queens to perform ritual and celebratory functions during the uprising. Thomas played a leading role and referred to herself as a "captain" in the rebellion. Allegedly, during one the uprisings Thomas had called for those unwilling to participate to be decapitated.
She was arrested and tried with other leaders of the labor uprising. During the trial of the labor leaders she gave witness testimony against another leader, Thomas Graydon, also known as "Colonel Peter", who was sentenced to death. Mary Thomas was also sentenced to death for arson and looting but had her sentence commuted to life imprisonment. She was transferred to Copenhagen and placed at Women's Prison, Christianshavn, in 1882, but in 1887 she was sent back to Christiansted, St. Croix, to serve the remainder of her sentence.
Legacy.
Thomas obtained semi-mythical status in the Virgin Islands oral tradition, where a popular song commemorates her actions in the uprising:
The Queen Mary Highway on St. Croix is named after her.
In 2018, the artists Jeannette Ehlers and La Vaughn Belle created a monumental public sculpture, "I Am Queen Mary", depicting a 7 meters (23 ft)-tall statue of Mary Thomas seated on a throne wielding a torch and a cane knife. The statue was unveiled in Copenhagen in 2018; it is Denmark's first public monument to a Black woman.
A book titled "Fireburn The Screenplay: A story of passion ignited, based on the history of St. Croix" written by Caribbean-American writer Angela Golden Bryan was published in 2018. The book pays tribute to Queen Mary and other leaders of the revolt.

20α-Dihydrotrengestone

20α-Dihydrotrengestone (20α-DHTG), also known as 20α-hydroxytrengestone, as well as 6-chloro-20("S")-hydroxy-9β,10α-pregna-1,4,6-trien-3-one, is a progestin and the major active metabolite of trengestone. It appears that trengestone is a prodrug of 20α-DHTG, as it is largely transformed into this metabolite when given orally in humans. 20α-DHTG has potent progestogenic activity similarly to trengestone.

The Castle of Csesznek lies in the Bakony between Győr and Zirc in the village of Csesznek. The castle was constructed after the Mongol invasion of Europe around 1263 in a period where many castles were built. The first castle was built by Jakab Cseszneky of the Bána clan. The first written mention of the castle is in a document from 1281 that gives Jakab Cseszneky's sons joint ownership of the castle. In 1315 the Csák clan conquered the castle. In 1392 Sigismund gave the castle and 31 surrounding villages to the Garai family. The castle was owned by the Garai family until 1482. Then Matthias Corvinus donated the castle to Stephen Zápolya.

Formation and "Chrome" (2014–2015).
Ardian Bora and Taddl Tjarks met Marius Ley through Izzi, their YouTube colleague, in 2014. That summer Tjarks and Ley produced "Motus", an EP which reached number 35 on the German album chart for one week.
Bora and Tjarks then formed the rap group Dat Adam with Marius Ley. The Hydra, a symbol of the band, is tattooed on the members' fingers.
The EP "Chrome", primarily produced by Ley, was released as a download on April 24, 2015.

<doc id="57001426" url="?curid=57001426" title="Russell K. Haight Jr.">
Russell K. Haight Jr.

Russell K. Haight Jr. was an American G.I. who had served as a U.S. Army Air Force sergeant during World War II. After the war, he became "famous" by serving as a mercenary commander of the rebel forces of Azad Kashmir for a few months in 1947. His testimony about Pakistan's involvement in the hostilities was cited in the United Nations debates on the Kashmir dispute.
Army career.
By his own account, Haight served in three armies during the World War II. He first served with the Canadians, then switched to the British and participated in the commando raid on Dieppe. Finally, he joined the American Army after the US joined the war.
After the war, Haight went to Afghanistan and worked as a surveyor for the American construction company Morrison–Knudsen, which was engaged in building roads there. After having a fall from a cliff, he left the job, and was intending to head back to the US with various stops in Pakistan and India along the way.
Kashmir War.
In Rawalpindi, then the hotbed of the First Kashmir War raging in 1947, Haight ran into the British correspondent Bill Sydney Smith of the "Daily Express", who suggested to him that he could utilise his expertise in commanding the Pakistani tribal raiders engaged in the Kashmir War. Haight was sold on the idea.
He signed up with the Azad Kashmir provisional government, then based in Rawalpindi. He was given a commission as a Captain and sent to the Poonch front. After he criticised the Azad Kashmir commanders there for their "boy scout tactics", the government apparently promoted him to the rank of a "brigadier general". He later claimed to have commanded 8,000 troops. According to a "New York Times" report by Robert Trumbull, Haight was able to successfully discharge his command by playing on the vanity of the tribesmen and exploiting their tribal rivalries.
By the end of 1947, Haight's engagement with the Kashmir War was over. While he claimed to have quit because of inadequate resources, scuffles with some of the fighters from Dir had played a role. The fighters are said to have attempted to steal Haight's truck and some captured guns, and he ended up killing a couple of them in the ensuing firefight. Trumbull states that, he was effectively a fugitive by the time he left Pakistan. He took a flight to the US with only $2.00 in his pocket.
According to a Soviet writer, I. Andronov, Haight was "actively assisted by several resident agents of the British Intelligence Service and top-flight British representatives in India and Pakistan".
According to journalist G. K. Reddy, then a PR official in the Azad Kashmir government, Russell K. Haight was "a senior officer of the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS)". He is said to have operated in Azad Kashmir under the code name 'General Tariq'.
Haight estimated that there were 15,000 tribal fighters in Kashmir, and a similar number on the move ("coming and going on dispersed along the border"). There were also said to be a fair number of Pakistani officers on leave involved in the war. Robert Trumbull narrated:
Later career.
After returning from South Asia, Haight went back to the US Army. He served in 
Korea, Germany, Bolivia and Vietnam, and retired from U.S. army in 1967 as a sergeant-major. He had seven rows of decorations and ribbons and numerous injuries from the various theatres in which he fought.

Crema de fruta (Spanish: Fruit Cream) is a traditional Filipino fruitcake made with layers of sponge cake, sweet custard or whipped cream, gelatin or "gulaman" (agar), and various preserved or fresh fruits, including mangoes, pineapples, cherries, and strawberries. It is usually served during the Christmas season. It has multiple variations, ranging from changes in the fruits used to the addition of ingredients like jam, sago, condensed milk, and others.
An icebox cake variant of "crema de fruta" also exists, which is much easier to prepare. It is traditionally made with ladyfingers instead of sponge cake, with layers of custard and fruits. A modern variant of this is the "crema de mangga" or "mango float", which uses graham crackers, whipped cream, and ripe Carabao mangoes.
