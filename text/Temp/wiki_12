Operation McGill français

Operation McGill français was a large street demonstration in Montréal during the Quiet Revolution. Though comprising a range of trade unionists, Quebec nationalists, students and other leftists raising many different demands (along with a small contingent from McGill's CEGEP), the key objective for which the protest was called was for McGill University to become a French-speaking educational institution. The demonstration took place in Montreal on March 28, 1969 in the midst of Quebec's Quiet Revolution. On this day, approximately 10,000–15,000 protesters, gathered and walked down Sherbrooke street towards the Roddick Gates calling for McGill University to become francophone, along with pro-worker and nationalist demands . These protesters held signs that read slogans such as "McGill aux Québécois!" and "McGill aux travailleurs", which loosely translates to "McGill to Quebeckers" and "McGill to workers" respectively.
Afraid this demonstration might turn violent, 100 police officers were deployed as well as 1,300 police officers on call. Also awaiting the demonstrators at the Roddick Gates were 3,000 spectators. The demonstration was mostly peaceful, with some altercations taking place between demonstration supporters and some English students who responded to the demonstration by chanting "God save the Queen".
Background.
The political agenda of this demonstration largely coincided with the current of Quebec nationalist ideology that emphasised decolonisation and the construction of a socialist Francophone-dominated Quebec, especially that espoused in the political review Parti Pris. Those taking part in Opération McGill saw McGill University as a key symbol of Anglo-Saxon power in Quebec and the idea to "francise" the university coincided with the larger aim of decolonizing Quebec. Though the call to turn McGill into a French-speaking university was very popular symbolically within the far-left of the Quebec nationalist movement, there was a much broader political consensus around the need to create a network of public francophone higher educational establishments to redress both the linguistic imbalance in higher education and the lack of access for Francophone students (at the time, only three of the six publicly supported universities were French-speaking, while all universities were still privately run), something which came to fruition less than a month after "Operation McGill" with the establishment of the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) as the flagship metropolitan university within the public francophone University of Quebec network. Leading the charge of this demonstration were former McGill professor Stanley Gray and nationalist Raymond Lemieux who spoke to the crowd of people demanding equal rights for francophones and also demanded that McGill become a francophone educational institution.
Prior to the demonstration, key demonstrator, Stanley Gray was fired from his position as a political science professor at McGill University in 1969. However, prior to his firing, he had established a group named the Students for a Democratic University (SDU) on November 23, 1967. It consisted of 150 students and professors who were also in favour of the idea of decolonisation and instituting more power to French people not only at McGill but throughout Quebec as well. The SDU had begun many demonstrations, with each getting larger than the previous one. During the early months of 1969, before the operation, Gray and the other members of the SDU had interrupted a Senate meeting on January 24, 1969 echoing similar chants such as "Revolution", "Long live the Socialist Quebec" and "Long live Quebec". The group would then again take similar actions on January 27, 1969 when they impeded a meeting of the Assembly of the Board of Governors. Later, the SDU would be renamed as the Radical Student Association (RSA). Gray was also a founding member of the Movement for the Integration of School (MIS), who organised the demonstration on that day. The SDU and the MIS would work together for the same goals.
Another key member of the MIS was Raymond Lemieux, an American with French-Canadian heritage. He, along with fellow founding member Stanley Gray would gather approximately 3,000 members leading up to the demonstration. The MIS would then strengthen the Saint-Léonard crisis when elected on June 28, 1968. The Saint-Léonard crisis largely developed from leftist thinkings which disallowed bilingual classes and adopted only unilingual French classes.
The newspaper, the McGill Daily, also supported the cause heavily and distributed a special edition announcing the preparation of Operation McGill through 100,000 copies instead of its usual 14,000 copies. In it was a document titled "Welcome to McGill" written entirely in French and sent across the province of Quebec with the aid of students and the members of the major trade union in Québec, the CSN. In short, the document criticized the ruling elites of Quebec and argued that the people of Quebec were exploited both culturally and economically. Concluding the article with the need to democratise McGill for these reasons and why the workers, students and anyone who felt discriminated against should demonstrate.
On March 26, 1969 activists Raymond Lemieux, Stanley Gray, Léandre Bergeron and CSN president, Michael Chartrand stated that they would be talking about the Operation via posters throughout campus with would be held in the ballroom of the University Centre.
In the context of the Quiet Revolution.
The Quiet Revolution, also known as La "révolution tranquille," spanned roughly from 1960-1970 in Quebec, Canada. The Revolution when Jean Lesage, leader of the Liberal party, was elected on June 22, 1960 winning 51% of the popular vote. The Liberal Party of Quebec's manifesto called for a number of important changes to modernise Quebec society after Maurice Duplessis's, and prior reigns, including the creation of a modern welfare state (including garaunteed education, healthcare and income support), the intervention by the state in the economy, an Office of the French Language, as well as several proposals that would go on to form the cornerstone of Quebec-Canada relations (inter-provincial conferences, a Minister for Provincial-Federal Affairs). The beginning of the Quiet Revolution also saw the birth of Women's Liberation Movement, Black Power Movement in Quebec along with the ever-increasing influence and power of both the trade union movement and the modern Quebec nationalist movement, heavily influenced by leftist ideology. Operation McGill included or connected with all of these movements.
Student movements.
Francophone students did not fare well in the large scale of Quebec's education system. Very few Francophones were allowed into universities where a large percentage was Anglophone. Only 7% of McGill students had French as their mother tongue while the percentage of French-speaking people was 82%. Students who had English as their mother tongue accounted for 42% of university enrollments in Quebec which in greater context is higher compared to the 18% of students for the provincial population. In a time of increasing awareness and discontent with the economic and social inequalities between Quebec's Anglophone and Franchophone communities, the lack of educational opportunities was seen as a key issue.
Motivated by the discrepancies in educational provision and general economic inequality, several student movements adapted leftist thinking such as l'Union générale des étudiants (UGEQ). The UGEQ united the many other student bodies in Quebec, 1964 and would go on to form many student movements which the leaders of the Operation did consider as motivation. In the latter half of 1968, the UGEQ picked up its radical agenda. The CEGEP system was created to expand post-secondary education and these junior colleges were established all throughout Quebec. However, these colleges were seen by many as insufficient and as recreating the inequalities within the university sector. In October, Quebec government officials had declared that about 20,000 students of the CEGEP system would not be allowed the opportunity to study at a university level come the following school year. This led to about 5,000 to 10,000 students protesting this affair on October 21, 1968 shouting "étudiants ouvriers" and demanding the allowance of a better education for the students under this system. Many student groups decided at this time that conciliation with the government was no longer a viable option, and direct actions and more radical demands became more important.
Although a portion of those attending and organising the demonstration had the goal of a general improvement in Quebec's higher educational system, some groups used it to call attention to the perceived notion that McGill University was directly influencing American Imperialism and thus, allowing discrimination against the French peoples. This not only affected the student movement but also all the other movements during the Quiet Revolution as well the fight against racism, to the workers movement and ending with the Women's Liberation Movement. Thus, Operation McGill français was part of a greater effort during the Quiet Revolution to incorporate better education and social equality.
Connection to the Parti Pris.
The journal, "Parti Pris""," also began around this time in 1963. Two scholars named Jean-Marc Piotte and André Major were attempting to fight for the equality of the French-Canadian population of Quebec (soon to be known as "les Québécois"). One of their key aims was to create a common fight for the decolonisation of Quebec, with the articles analysing the cultural, social and economic conditions in Quebec through the lens of decolonisation connected with the establishment of a socialist political programme. This journal contributed to the creation of a new political language during the early 1960s. The leaders of "Parti Pris" also organized discussions, street protests, public meetings and reading groups. The political movements participating in McGill were closely aligned with the objectives and ideas espoused by the authors in "Parti Pris".
Connection to the Sir George Williams affair.
Just a couple of months prior to Operation McGill was another large protest known as the Sir George Williams affair. This was a protest in regards to Quebec's discrimination towards its black citizens when 6 black students argued racial discrimination from then assistant professor of biology, Mr. Perry Anderson. Much like the rest of the workers, feminist and student movements, the citizens involved in the Black Power movement felt like they were not being heard. In response to the administrations lack of action, 200 students and protesters peacefully overtook the ninth floor of the Hall building of Sir George Williams University on January 29, 1969. They overtook the computer centre and stayed there until February 11 when they were forcefully taken by police officers after starting a fire to keep around 30 police officers out. Nevertheless, the police officers were successful in detaining and arresting 96 students involved in the affair. It may just be considered the largest school riot in Canadian history.
The Sir George Williams affair would turn violent with over 2 million dollars worth of damage to computers and the school, though the initial intention was to remain peaceful. This affair led to other school protests throughout Quebec which included Operation McGill.
Both students bodies used their own respective newspapers, "The Georgian" and "The McGill Daily" to gain support for their causes.
Workers movements.
Quebec's economy in the 1960s and prior was largely ruled by Anglophone elites. Francophones were not happy with this arrangement, since the vast of the majority of the population were French speakers. Anglophones and Francophones often lived in different conditions with the Anglophones living in wealthy areas and the Francophones living in the poorer areas. Anglophones consisted of 56% of Montreal's best-paid workers and only consisted of about 24% of the labor force. Furthermore, Francophones only controlled 20% of the economy and also represented 40% of Canada's total unemployment rate. Even though they lived in a French province, a large percentage were being forced to learn English to be able to work and almost half the time, workers were required to speak to their managers in English. During the early years of the Revolution (1961-1965), there was an average of about 67.6 strikes per year. In the later years (1966-1970), this number nearly doubled to 143 strikes per year. During these strikes, workers argued against poor housing conditions, unemployment, price increases and discrimination.
To change this, leftist parties engaging in nationalist ideas started organising worker movements. Such movements were led by then president of the CSN, Marcel Pepin. In 1966, Pepin would go on to change the situation with his 'moral report', which would then go on to explain the urgency for multiple worker movements and if need be, a call for arms and further resistance. This would later influence those involved in the October Crisis and members of the CSN to revolt in Operation McGill. Leftist thinkers believed that the French population as a whole had a right to defend themselves, and this did not exclude workers.
Examples of this led to many groups such as the Mouvement de libération du taxi, citizens' and workers' committees, the Chevaliers de l'indépendance, the Comité Vallières-Gagnon and the Montreal Central Council of the CSN assisting the MIS coalition gaining over 50,000 supporters. The CSN and MIS coalition would support the Operation showing how the demonstration was acting in the context of allowing better work for the Francophone people. It would try to allow French to strive in the workplace instead of English, which demonstrated power over the French people much like McGill had.
Post Operation McGill at McGill University.
After Operation McGill français, a few other events appeared to protest the discrimination and continue with the fight of decolonisation at McGill University. A major event was the creation of the "Birth Control Handbook" which affected many women at McGill University and continued debates on whether or not McGill University should become French.
Birth Control Handbook.
The "Birth Control Handbook" was considered part of the Women's Liberation movement as a way of decolonizing Quebec and being accepted into the general population. Women seemed to be tired of men controlling their decisions and life choices. The "Birth Control Handbook," created by McGill Students Society, was an attempt to gain their longed for control of their own bodies and choices during the late 1960s. Although it was published in 1968, the handbook took off in the summer of 1969 when it had sold 50,000 copies and two years later it would reach nearly 2 million copies. This handbook demonstrates that there were still persistent problems being argued at McGill university during this time and that Operation McGill played into the bigger picture of decolonized Quebec and better equality for all.
The Legacy of Operation McGill français.
There is no true legacy that exists for Operation McGill français. It did bring together thousands of people to protest unequal rights and for better services in the Anglo-Saxon community they lived in, but did not have much significance prior to such. In fact, it is something that historians have barely researched in regards to its influence on the Quiet Revolution and Quebec's history in general.
McGill University today.
Today, McGill University continues to be one of three English universities in Quebec, demonstrating that the efforts to make McGill French had failed. However, today the student body is approximately 20.3% Francophone. This is a significant improvement over the Francophone student body during the Quiet Revolution that consisted of approximately 3%. Students now have the opportunity to write any work in English or French even though the language of instruction continues to be predominantly in English.

Geology of Malta

The Geology of Malta consists of a sequence of sedimentary rocks of late Oligocene to late Miocene age cut through by a set of extensional faults of Pliocene age.
Tectonics.
The Maltese archipelago is situated on the mainly shallow water continental platform between Sicily and North Africa that lies beneath the Sicily Channel, separating the Ionian Basin from the western Mediterranean Basin. The islands lie around 200 km to the south of the subduction boundary between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The platform is crossed by a rift zone formed of three grabens: the Pantelleria graben, that of Malta, and that of Linosa. The faults bounding these grabens are associated with most of the earthquakes that affect the archipelago, although some earthquakes with epicentres in Sicily may have damaging effects, such as the 1693 Sicily earthquake.
Formation of the islands.
The Maltese archipelago, situated between Sicily and Tunisia, was created through the uplift of sedimentary rocks. This uplift dates from the late Miocene to the Pliocene. Malta forms the crest of a tilted block on the edge of the Malta Graben. The isle of Lampedusa is made up of an identical structure on the southwest side of this rift.
Nature of the sub-soil.
The rocks are exclusively sedimentary. There is a lot of limestone, which has contributed to the construction of the ancient buildings of the island. These rocks come from marine deposits (essentially from lagoons) dating from between 25 and 5 million years ago.
The geological strata.
The stratigraphy of the Maltese islands consists of five geological formations, ranging in age from late Oligocene to late Miocene.
Oligocene.
Lower Coralline Limestone Formation.
The oldest exposed rock layer of Malta is the Lower Coralline Limestone Formation (), which is of Chattian age (~28–23 million years old) with a maximum thickness of 162 m. The unit is exposed on the lower parts of cliffs in the south-west of the archipelago such as at Dingli, and also along rifts, particularly near Mosta and Naxxar. This is a hard limestone which is pale grey in colour, and comparable to the Upper Coralline Limestone. At the top of this unit a hardground is generally developed indicating a period during which the seafloor was exposed. It is this formation of which the Azure Window, a spectacular coastal rock arch, popular with tourists and film-makers, was composed, prior to its final collapse in 2017.
Miocene.
Globigerina Limestone Formation.
The Globigerina Limestone () is a soft, gold-coloured limestone of Aquitanian to Langhian age (~23–14 million years old), ranging in thickness from 23 m to 207 m. It contains many fossils, especially those of the foraminifera "Globigerina" that give it its name. It is divided into three members, the lower, middle and upper, with the boundaries between them being hardgrounds, representing the effects of further seabed exposure.
Since prehistoric times, this limestone has constituted the majority of building material used in Malta. Exposed to the air, the stone takes on a rosy colour, which browns with the formation of a protective patina. Lesser quality rocks can erode easily however, and can show honeycomb weathering. This rock has also been exported, and was used in the construction of the government palace of Corfu. The Maltese Lower Globigerina Limestone has been designated by the International Union of Geological Sciences as a Global Heritage Stone Resource.
Blue Clay Formation.
The Blue Clay () is a blue-gray mudstone of Langhian to Tortonian in age (~15–10 million years old) measuring up to 65 m thick. It shows major thickness variations and is missing completely from most of the eastern parts of the islands. It was deposited in a deepwater environment. It forms an impermeable layer beneath the Greensand and Upper Coralline Limestone formations. It is most visible in the northwest of Malta and the northeast of Gozo. It allows the capture of rainfall and the creation of aquifers. Water is extracted through wells or escapes through occasional springs when the topsoil has been eroded.
Greensand Formation.
The Greensand () is a glauconite-bearing sandstone of Tortonian age (~10–7 million years old). Yellow-green in colour, it takes on an orange tint when it comes into contact with the air. It is generally very thin, a few tens of centimetres in most areas, with a maximum thickness of 11 m. It is friable and therefore unsuitable for building purposes. Its permeable nature and its position immediately above the Blue Clay allow for the infiltration of rainwater.
Upper Coralline Limestone Formation.
The top layer, the Upper Coralline Limestone (), is the youngest formation of Messinian age (~7–5 million years old) and is around 140 m thick. It is mainly present on the islands of Malta, Comino and in the east of Gozo. The Coralline Limestone is a hard, pale-grey limestone. It was used frequently in constructions requiring great strength, and in fortifications in particular.
Faults.
The rock layers in Malta are relatively flat-lying, with the exception of zones where the rock has been folded close to faults. The faults have two main orientations, with the largest faults being northwest-southeast trending, parallel to the line of islands, although these faults are only locally exposed, and a second set that are WSW-ENE trending, with generally small displacements that dominate the topography of the islands. The largest of the second set are the Victoria Lines Fault on northern Malta and the Qala Fault on southern Gozo.
Overall, the islands of the archipelago are tilted towards the northeast, with cliffs on the southwest coast and descending gradients towards the northeast.
Recent geological history.
The Maltese archipalego is linked to Sicily by an underwater plateau of depths of less than 100 m. During different marine regressions of the Mediterranean, Malta has been connected to Sicily by a surface isthmus by which animals have been able to cross, as evinced by the presence of island dwarfism (Maltese dwarf hippopotamus and dwarf elephant fossils), as well as island gigantism (fossils of the Maltese Giant Dormouse, Leithia melitensis).

Euphemia Vale Blake

Euphemia Vale Blake (pen names, E. Vale Smith and E. Vale Blake; 7 May 1817 – 21 October 1904) was a British-born American author and critic. She wrote extensively for the "North American Review", the "Christian Examiner", the "Boston Evening Transcript", and other well-known publications. From 1857, she lived in Brooklyn, engaged in journalism. She was the author of "Arctic Experiences"; "Teeth, Ether and Chloroform"; "History of Newburyport"; "A History of Tammany Hall", and "Ocean Wonders" (on sea life).
Early life and education.
Euphemia Vale was born in Hastings, England, 1817.
 Her parents were Prof. Gilbert and Hepsibah (Johnstone) Vale. She came with her father, mother and other members of the family to New York City in 1823. Prof. Vale was well known as an author, publisher, inventor, public lecturer and a professor of astronomy and other branches of mathematics, making a specialty of navigation; he died in Brooklyn in 1866.
Career.
In New York City, in 1842, she married Dr. Mayo Gerrish Smith, son of Foster Smith. Soon after her marriage, she came with her husband to Newburyport, and lived for some months in the family of her father-in-law, on Smith's court, removing later to a dwelling house on Essex street, where her husband had an office fitted up for his use as a surgeon dentist. After the discovery of gold in California, in 1849, Dr. Smith went to the Pacific coast, and remained there seven years.
During his absence, Blake was engaged in literary work. She was a frequent contributor to the "Newburyport Herald", taking the editorial duties whenever the chief was absent. She also edited a weekly literary paper the "Saturday Evening Union", and supplied leading articles for the "Watch Tower". At that time, she was also writing for the "North American Review" and "Christian Examiner", all the editorials for the "Bay State", a weekly published in Lynn, with occasional articles in the Boston daily journals, the "Transcript", "Traveller", "Atlas", and others. It was in the "Atlas" that one of her articles, in 1853, started the movement for revising the laws of Massachusetts and causing the adoption of that law limiting the franchise to those capable of reading the Constitution of the United States. She furnished a series of "Letters from New York" to the Boston "Traveller" and wrote essays for the "Religious Magazine". Then, for the "New York Quarterly", she did much book reviewing. She also wrote for the "Constellation", edited by Park Benjamin Sr. In 1854, she wrote and published the history of the town of Newburyport, and a scientific work on the use of ether and chloroform applied to practical dentistry. She wrote the first considerable criticisms of Dickens' early novels as they appeared, and also the early works of George William Curtis.
In 1857, she removed to New York, and was there granted a decree of divorce from her husband. In 1859 to 1861, she regularly supplied the "Crayon", an art magazine published in New York, with elaborate articles on literature and art. To settle a wager between two friends, one of whom bet that no one "could impose on the "New York Herald"," and the other thinking it might be possible, Blake wrote a "Great Manifesto! Declaration of Independence by the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi. Copy of the Instructions sent to France! etc." Frederic Hudson, the editor-in-chief accepted the manifesto as genuine. It was printed 14 November 1860, and paid for, and it was a nine-day wonder why the other papers never had it. In 1863, she married, in New York, Dr. Daniel S. Blake, who had been for ten or fifteen years a surgeon dentist in Newburyport. After her second marriage, she resided in Brooklyn.
In 1871, Blake furnished historical articles to the "Catholic World" on Milesians. Next followed articles for the "Christian Union", and, at the request of Henry Ward Beecher, a few short stories. A little later, she contributed essays to "Popular Science Monthly". One of her productions was printed in the "Brooklyn Eagle" of 23 November 1871, discussing the riparian rights of Brooklyn to her own shoreline. It was a historical piece of all the legislation on the subject, from colonial times to the date of publication. The late Chief Justice Joseph Nielson, of the city court, remarked that "the argument was unanswerable." In 1874, she published "Arctic Experiences" (New York), to give a correct history of the Polaris expedition and Captain George Tyson's ice drift, and containing also a sketch of all the preceding expeditions, both American and foreign. In 1879, and subsequently, Blake wrote regularly for the "Oriental Church Magazine." She wrote several lectures on historical and social topics for a literary bureau in New York, which were repeatedly delivered by a man who claimed them as his own. She also wrote a book on marine zoology and a series of articles on "The Marys of History, Art and Song." She occasionally wrote in verse.
Personal life.
She had two children with Smith, Mayo Vale Smith, born June 25, 1844,' and Euphemia Smith, born September 20, 1848.
Blake died 21 October 1904 at her home in Brooklyn, and is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery. The E. Vale Blake papers are held by the Brooklyn Historical Society.

Kretania sephirus

Kretania sephirus, previously known as "Plebejus sephirus", is a species of butterfly that belongs to the family Lycaenidae. It is found in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Asia Minor. The species is part of a species complex, with many members of the complex using variations of the name zephyr blue, including "pylaon", "trappi", and "hesperica". The species, which previously belonged to the genus "Plebejus", was moved to the genus "Kretania" following a 2013 molecular phylogenetics study of the subtribe Polyommatina. Many "sephirus" populations are threatened, and are legally protected in some countries, such as Hungary.
Description.
From Adalbert Seitz's "Die Großschmetterlinge des palaearktischen Faunengebietes":
L. sephyrus Friv. (78 h). Very similar to ["L. pylaon"], but almost twice the size, the underside dull grey, the red anal spots not so bright golden-red, but duller red like red lead. From the Balkan Peninsula, Asia Minor, and Armenia.
Larvae primarily feed on "Astragalus"; larvae of the Hungarian population "kovacsi" are known to feed mainly on "Astragalus exscapus". The myrmecophilous larvae are tended by ants, who collect the exudates that the larvae produce. The ants heap soil and debris at the bases of plants into which the larvae move to pupate.

Krakow UNESCO City of Literature

Krakow UNESCO City of Literature is a City of Literature located in Krakow, Poland, as a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network. Krakow joined the UCCN on 21 October 2013 as the first Slavic and second non-English speaking city. Krakow’s main objective as a UNESCO City of Literature is to develop and implement a program promoting literary heritage, popularize reading among its residents, and support the local book market. Krakow UNESCO City of Literature also functions as a coordinator for the Cities of Literature and a member of the UCCN Steering Committee.
The Krakow UNESCO City of Literature program is operated by the Krakow Festival Office.
Program.
The program followed by Krakow City of Literature involves activities and initiatives in the following 10 areas of development: 
Projects.
Festivals.
Krakow UNESCO City of Literature hosts two large literary festivals, i.e. the Conrad Festival (the greatest Polish event of its type), and the Milosz Festival. Both festivals were in 2017 granted the EFFE Label which is awarded by the European Festivals Association to events of international rank and distinctive artistic quality that are characterized by high involvement of the local community.
Debut support.
Krakow UNESCO City of Literature is involved in supporting young talents and literary debutants. Each year, during the Conrad Festival, the Conrad Award is awarded for the best literary debut. The “Promoters of Debuts” program has been developed in order to ensure funds for publishing houses to cover the cost of publication of debutant works. In addition, there is a UNESCO City of Literature Creative Writing Course which unites and educates young talents supervised by renowned and experienced writers.
Read PL!
Read PL! is a project created in cooperation with the Woblink.com e-book platform to promote reading through permitting free access to electronic versions of new book arrivals and bestsellers. In public places (mostly at bus/tram stops and in schools) the organisers post posters with QR codes which can be scanned with the Woblink application to offer free access to selected books.
City Codes.
Within the City Codes project, the benches in the Krakow Planty Park have been marked with special tablets with the names of writers who have been important for the city of Krakow, together with QR codes that refer to websites with fragments of texts by specific authors, as well as their Polish and English audio versions.
Multipoetry. Poems on the walls.
During each first week of month, poems written by authors connected with other Cities of Literature – Dublin, Edinburg, Iowa City, Melbourne, Norwich and Reykjavik – were displayed on the wall of the Potocki Family Tenement House at 20 Main Market Square in 2014 and 2015.
Literary walks.
Krakow UNESCO City of Literature organises cyclic literary walks whereby readers led by their guides have an opportunity to see buildings and places that used to be or that are important for the most outstanding writers living in Krakow. Several literary routes have been delineated so far within the project, including those dedicated to Wisława Szymborska, Czesław Miłosz, Stanisław Lem, Stanisław Wyspiański or Joseph Conrad.
Champion Bookstores in Krakow.
The project focuses on the cooperation with stationary bookstores in Krakow. It has been developed for the sake of readers, book lovers, and booksellers. Its task is to support the Krakow book market through the integration, coordination and implementation of the rich program of cultural events in Krakow stationary bookstores. The project is to equip booksellers with additional tools and promotion methods, to enrich their cultural offer, and build permanent relationships with readers.
Krakow Book Fair.
The Krakow Book Fair is a cyclic event that promotes the idea of second-hand book circulation. It is held once in every several weeks at the St. Mary Magdalene Square in Krakow, where a dozen or so of Krakow antiquarians and second-hand booksellers put up their stands and present their offer. The fair is always accompanied by discussions, literary meetings, and open-air shows.
Independent Bookstore Festival.
Independent Bookstore Festival is a project implemented in bookstores by the Copernicus Foundation under the patronage of Krakow UNESCO City of Literature. The Festival is a year-round series of events organised by booksellers for all readers who want to talk with one another about books.
Read locally.
The project aims at promoting bookstores as cultural centres and places where social ties begin. Read locally promotes most unique bookstores that carry out unique, proprietary and bottom-up cultural activity. The project includes a series of interviews with the staff and with famous frequent visitors of most interesting bookstores in Krakow.
The Second Life of a Book.
The action facilitates free book exchange. It is held cyclically at most interesting places that are connected with literature. 
International Cooperation.
ICORN (International Cities of Refuge Network).
ICORN is an independent network of cities that offer a shelter to writers and artists persecuted for their creative work. It acts in defence of the freedom of expression and of democratic values. It also acts for international solidarity. The network’s member cities offer refuge to those who cannot freely live and create in their own homelands due to persecutions. ICORN’s main objective is to ensure asylum to as many persecuted writers and artists as possible, and to establish a permanent global network to defend the freedom of expression together with its sister organisations. Within the ICORN program in 2011-2017, Krakow hosted seven writers: Maria Amelie (born Madina Salamowa – North Ossetia, today in Norway), Kareem Amer (Egypt/today in Norway), Mostafa Zamaninij (Iran), Lawon Barszczewski (Belarus), Asli Erdogan (Turkey), Felix Kaputu (Congo), and Monem Mahjoub (Libya). While implementing the ICORN program, Krakow City of Literature cooperates with the Villa Decius Association that coordinates the residents’ stay and offers them space for their creative work.
Drop the Mic. Nordic-Baltic Slam Poetry Network.
Drop the Mic is a project that aims at creating an international space for poets, writers, authors of texts, and organisers of festivals and poetry slams that support performative literature. The project is to popularize the idea of poetry slams and to integrate poets and other authors at international level through their joint participation in projects. So far, events within the Drop the Mic (meetings, workshops, poetry slams) have been held in Reykjavik (Iceland), Tartu (Estonia), Copenhagen (Dania), Heidelberg (Germany), and Krakow
Engage! Young Producers.
Engage! Young Producers is an international educational project aimed at promoting young people’s committed participation in literary and cultural life interpreted as a means to develop their critical thinking skills and better comprehension of multicultural reality. The project is addressed mainly to secondary school students (between 16 and 19 years of age), especially those with little access to culture, and to all local organisations and cultural institutions whose activity involves literature. Engage! is held simultaneously in several European cities (Barcelona, Norwich, Vaxjo, Krakow), and always with the support of secondary schools, libraries and cultural institutions that develop their own customized programs so as to best apply the general objectives of the complete Engage! project. Within the Engage! Young Producers project the Krakow Festival Office implements a yearly education program for secondary school students – Word for Word. Poetry is my language.
Krakow UNESCO City of Literature Residency Program.
The residency program is addressed to writers and authors from the other UNESCO Cities of Literature. During their stipend stay in Krakow, residents have an opportunity to experience Krakow literary life, establish contacts with the local literary industry and writers. So far, Krakow has hosted Brynjar Jóhannesson from Reykjavik, Sarah Stewart from Edinburgh, and Sarah Herman from Norwich.&lt;br&gt;

Can I Say (book)

Can I Say is a 2015 autobiography by American drummer Travis Barker, written with the help of "Rolling Stone" and "The New York Times" contributor Gavin Edwards. It was published on October 20, 2015 by the William Morrow. The book features contributions from many friends and family members of Barker, including members of Blink-182, Transplants and The Aquabats.
Summary and themes.
Barker dedicated the book to his family and opened with a first-hand account of surviving his 2008 plane crash before discussing his early life.
The book chronicles Barker's childhood, vegan diet and early love of drumming as well as the formation of his companies Famous Stars and Straps and LaSalle Records. He also discusses the break-ups of Blink-182 and the Meet The Barkers reality show.
Barker also relates his marriages to Melissa Kennedy and Shanna Moakler and his relationship with Paris Hilton, and claims to be a sex addict. He also discusses his battle with drug addiction, his fear of flying and his friendship with and the death of Adam Goldstein, which he describes as having a profound effect on him.
Release and reception.
William Morrow released an initial hardcover printing of 100,000 copies October 20, 2015. with paperback version released on September 6, 2016. An audiobook narrated by Cary Hite and produced by Buck 50 Productions came out on September 15, 2016.
Billboard called the book, "(A) riveting, brutally honest memoir" while Rolling Stone called it, "a fascinating look into the life of a talented, hard-partying musician who has beaten the odds several times." Not all reviews were positive, however, with New Noise Magazine reviewer John B. Moore complaining writing, "Is the book honest? I guess; is it salacious? You bet; is it worth more the read? Not if you’ve evolved past dick jokes."
Barker said it was hard doing the press for the book due to frequently being asked to comment on the plane crash and his addiction problems on talk shows and said was disappointed by the headlines of articles about the book focussing on his relationships and the more outrageous parts of the memoir. However, Barker told The Toronto Sun that he was happy with how honest the book was saying, "Some of the stuff in the book makes my skin crawl with shame. But it was important to say it."

Big Stone County Courthouse

The Big Stone County Courthouse in Ortonville, Minnesota is the center of government for Big Stone County, Minnesota. The county was established by the Minnesota Legislature in 1862, but the government was not organized until 1873, when Governor Horace Austin appointed three county commissioners. They did nothing, so Governor Cushman Kellogg Davis appointed three replacement commissioners in 1874. The county seat was established at Ortonville in 1874 and three elected commissioners took office in the beginning of 1877. The organization was challenged in court, and the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that the county had not properly been organized. The county was declared organized in 1881 by the Minnesota Legislature. The first courthouse, a wood frame structure, was built in October 1882, but was destroyed by fire on October 31, 1885. A new wood frame courthouse was built in 1886, and the county later built a granite jail building in 1895.
In 1901, the county decided to replace the wood-frame courthouse with a brick building. Architect Fremont D. Orff designed the building, and Ole H. Olsen of Stillwater, Minnesota was awarded the construction contract. The building was completed in 1902. The previous wooden courthouse was donated to the local school district, which used it for a classroom until it was demolished in 1918. The 1895 jail building was demolished during the 1940s.
The building is faced with light brown brick and is accented with Ortonville granite trim. During a 1983-1984 study, the Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office surveyed seven counties in west central Minnesota, and noted that the courthouse was the largest turn-of-the-century building in Big Stone County and one of its best examples of large-scale Victorian architecture. It is historically significant as one of a shrinking number of Victorian-style Minnesota courthouses, and it has served as the seat of government since it was built.

Osceola Commercial Historic District

The Osceola Commercial Historic District is a nationally recognized historic district located in Osceola, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. At the time of its nomination, the district was composed of 42 contributing buildings. Beginning in 1874 the central business district had a series of devastating fires that led to the development of the area. Practices such as gaps between the buildings, ornate cornices that are smaller in scale, and brick and metal construction of new buildings were the result. Many of the buildings were recognized for their architecture, which includes Italianate, Queen Anne, Neoclassical, Art Deco, and Mid-century modern styles. Significant buildings include the Arlington-Howe-Garner Hotel (1882), the United States Post Office (1935), the original city hall/fire station building, the Clarke County Courthouse (1956), and the water tower (1957). The Masonic Building (1872) is individually listed on the National Register.

Business.
Bulat Utemuratov is one of the most prolific entrepreneurs of Kazakhstan. His first large project was the development of the "ATF Bank" and its successful sale to UniCredit (from 1995 until November 2007). During that time, the bank grew from a small financial institution to a large multi-regional and multi-product financial group with 160 branches. 
Unicredit acquired ATF Bank for $2.1 billion in 2007 and Utemuratov reportedly made $785 million from the sale.
Subsequent reports suggested that Utemuratov's stake in ATF had been larger than previously known and that he and family members made more than $1 billion from the sale.
The deal turned out to be a poor one for Unicredit and within a year of acquiring ATF, the Italian bank had written down the value by €500 million. Unicredit sold ATF in 2013 for just $500 million.
After the 2009 crisis, the following banks were created: Kassa Nova, the first microcredit bank in Kazakhstan and ForteBank, a business bank. In May 2014, Samruk-Kazyna SWF closed a sale of its shares in Temirbank and part of its shares in Aliance Bank to businessman Bulat Utemuratov. 
Bulat Utemuratov is a key fund investor (not a shareholder) of Verny Capital investment group, together with VEON he also owns two telecommunications operators –"KarTel" in Kazakhstan and "SkyMobile" in Kyrgyzstan operating under the brand: Beeline.
In October 2019, Bulat Utemuratov was in the top three of Forbes list of the 50 richest businessmen of Kazakhstan with an estimated capital of US$3,4 billion.
On December, 1 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported about the freezing of Bulat Utemuratov's assets including stakes in luxury hotels, cash in bank accounts in half a dozen countries and a Burger King franchise, by a UK civil court on the claim of BTA Bank.
President Nazarbayev.
After Kazakhstan became an independent country in 1991, President Nursultan Nazarbayev selected Utemuratov to go to Vienna and find economic opportunities for the new republic.
After Utemuratov returned, he stayed close to President Nazarbayev and held several senior roles in the Kazakh government.
This included Secretary of the Security Council from 2003 to 2006 and head of the President's private office from 2006 to 2008.
From 2008 to 2013, he was described as an "adviser to the President" and he also held a role as a special representative to Kyrgyzstan.
This close relationship between Utemuratov and President Nazarbayev has led to questions about the origins of Utemuratov's wealth.
In a letter to the London Stock Exchange, they opposition leaders said: "Bulat Utemuratov, the former head of administration for the President of Kazakhstan, is a co-owner of Kazzinc. Utemuratov is widely believed to be holding these assets for the benefit of Nazarbayev."
This close relationship with President Nazarbayev led to Utemuratov being given the nickname "the grey cardinal" in Kazakhstan. He was also described as President Nazarbayev's "personal financial manager" in a US diplomatic cable leaked by WikiLeaks.
Glencore.
Glencore , the Swiss-based mining and commodities company, acquired the Vasilkovskoye gold mine in Kazakhstan from Utemuratov's Verny Capital. As part of this transaction, Verny was given shares in Kazzinc, Glencore's copper subsidiary in Kazakhstan.
When Glencore announced its initial public offering (IPO) in London in 2011, the company said that some of the proceeds would be used to buy back the Kazzinc shares held by Verny Capital
In 2012, Glencore bought the Kazzinc shares back from Verny Capital for $1.359 billion, including $400 million in cash and the rest in Glencore shares.
Since that transaction, Utemuratov and Glencore have done several other deals together and this has raised concerns about the nature of the relationship. 
In 2015, Glencore bought Utemuratov's Gulfstream private jet in an undisclosed transaction.
In 2012, Glencore's Kazzinc subsidiary bought a 56% in a private school called Haileybury Astana for $23 million. The company wrote off this investment and in 2016 transferred it to Utemuratov's charity for free. The school was opened by President Nazarbayev.
The Times quoted a spokeswoman for Utemuratov saying he: "is neither a middleman, nor proxy for President Nazarbayev" and that he had not profited from his relationship with the President.
In 2013, Glencore gave a loan to Astana Property Management (APM), a company owned by Bulat Utemuratov via Verny Capital. The loan was to finance APM's construction of the Talan Towers hotel and apartment complex in Astana, Kazakhstan. Glencore loaned a total of $237 million to the project but the miner was forced to write off $96.5 million in 2018 after reported poor performance.
Awards.
In 2016, Bulat Utemuratov was chosen as one of the nominees in the "Business" category of the national project «El Tulgasy» (Leader of the Motherland) The idea of the project was to select the most significant citizens of Kazakhstan whose names are now associated with the achievements of the country.

Liwa Dawud

Liwa Dawud (Arabic:لواء داوود, liwa' dawud, The David Brigade) was an armed group in the Syrian Civil War headquartered in Samrin in the Idlib Governorate and originated as a subunit in Suqour al-Sham then later became an independent faction then joined the Jaysh al-Sham coalition until 2014 when the group along with its leader defected to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant during the course of the Inter-rebel conflict during the Syrian Civil War.
Background.
Leadership.
In an interview the group's leader Hassan Aboud stated that the rebels were corrupt profiteers. Other rebel groups were suspicious of Aboud and Liwa Dawud for being extremists and Islamic State affiliates in Idlib. Aboud and one of his brothers fought American forces during the Iraq War, according to locals. Some suggested that the pair returned to Syria as a sleeper cell tied to Al Qaeda in Iraq. Prior to the foundation of Liwa Dawud Hassan Aboud joined Suqour al-Sham in 2011. Other members of Jaysh al-Sham saw Liwa Dawud as a fifth-column element, Abboud also made frequent meetings with ISIL's leadership in 2013. After the 2013 meetings a campaign began of secret operations to sabotage other groups and it was during this period Aboud assumed leadership over Liwa Dawud. Also in 2013 Abu Ali al-Anbari met with various rebel leaders in the Idlib Governorate including Aboud and gave $2 million and weapons to Aboud and Liwa Dawud. The brigade has also been accused of assassinating Ahrar al-Sham leaders and of holding James Foley before turning him over to ISIL.
Through the course of the group's existence its members had been suspected of carrying out assassinations against rivals and individuals who betrayed the group as part of their secret operations campaign.
Al Sheikh Al Jaqia tried to establish a sufi order near Idlib with around 1,115 inhabitants in October 20, 2011 to July 13, 2012 when Al Nusra Front barged in and killed around 20 major leaders of the project and imprisoned around 700 suspected members.
History.
Suqour al-Sham.
The group began as a subunit in Suqour al-Sham in 2012 under the leadership of Hassan Aboud and became notable for its use of IEDs against government forces on highways and seizing weapons and vehicles including tanks from the Syrian Army. While being a subunit in Suqour al-Sham the group also participated in the Battle of Taftanaz, they conducted an ambush against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and National Defense Forces near the border between the Aleppo Governorate and Idlib Governorate. During the battle of Taftanaz the rebels captured or destroyed between 15 to 20 Syrian military helicopters in the city's air base.
In February 2014, ISIL signed a cease-fire agreement with Suqour al-Sham after a series of clashes between ISIL and Syrian opposition groups in early 2014. The agreement stated both groups would end hostilities and not interfere in the other's affairs, the agreement was signed by representatives from ISIL and Suqour al-Sham, as well as a Liwa Dawud commander acting as a third party witness.
Jaysh al-Sham.
In early 2014 Aboud announced that Liwa Dawud was to join Jaysh al-Sham while simultaneously following ISIL's instructions. 
ISIL.
In July 2014 he declared his loyalty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Liwa Dawud officially defected and the remaining members of Liwa Dawud numbering 1,000 departed to Raqqa. Aboud along with remnants of the group fought in multiple battle for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant including the battle of Kobane against the Kurdish People's Protection Units and Free Syrian Army-linked Arab factions exiled to the city after coming into conflict with ISIL, the group also took part in the Palmyra Offensive, and members of the group also staffed courts run by ISIL.
In June 2018, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham arrested remnants of the group at checkpoints established in a triangle spanning from Misbin to Nayrab to Sarmin where the group was formerly based, due to high ISIL-linked activity and presence of ISIL affiliated cells in the area, along with remnants of Liwa Dawud, former members of Jaysh al-Sham which Liwa Dawud was part of were arrested as well as former Liwa al-Haqq members.

CHCHD2

Coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CHCHD2 gene.
Function.
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to a class of eukaryotic CX(9)C proteins characterized by four cysteine residues spaced ten amino acids apart from one another. These residues form disulfide linkages that define a CHCH fold. In response to stress, the protein translocates from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the nucleus where it binds to a highly conserved 13 nucleotide oxygen responsive element in the promoter of cytochrome oxidase 4I2, a subunit of the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain.
In concert with recombination signal sequence-binding protein J, binding of this protein activates the oxygen responsive element at four percent oxygen. In addition, it has been shown that this protein is a negative regulator of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. In response to apoptotic stimuli, mitochondrial levels of this protein decrease, allowing BCL2-associated X protein to oligomerize and activate the Caspase Cascade. Pseudogenes of this gene are found on multiple chromosomes. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016].

John Breholt

John Breholt (fl. 1697-1711) was a pirate and salvager active in the Caribbean, the Carolinas, and the Azores. He is best known for organizing several attempts to get the pirates of Madagascar to accept a pardon and bring their wealth home to England.
Biography.
Rumor had long held that pirates on and around Madagascar, such as those concentrated around the pirate trading posts on Ile Ste.-Marie, kept vast sums of money from their plundering. As early as 1697 Breholt approached MP Charles Egerton with a plan to induce the pirates of Madagascar to accept a general pardon and return their wealth to England.
His plans came to nothing so with the backing of the Earl of Carlisle he sailed in 1699 for the Caribbean (in a ship named "Carlisle") with a scheme for looting shipwrecks. That August he briefly sailed alongside a flotilla attempting to hunt down associates of William Kidd before heading to Havana to search for the wrecks. When he tried to stop a Spanish vessel in October to hire a local pilot, the Spaniards fled from him; incensed, his crew looted their vessel instead, and giving up on finding the wrecks, sailed to the Carolinas. He arrived in December but a dispute with his crew led them to accuse him of piracy. Breholt was tried but acquitted.
Leaving the Carolinas in early 1700, he hinted that he might sail for Virginia or Cape Verde. Instead he headed to the Azores where he was arrested by the Portuguese. Tried for piracy yet again, he was transported to Lisbon and imprisoned. Crewmen remaining aboard the "Carlisle" escaped under fire and took the ship to Madagascar, where the ship was lost; while there Breholt's brother George (who had served as the "Carlisle’s" first mate) was captured by the Royal Navy and accepted a pardon.
Breholt was released from prison in Lisbon in 1701 and made his way back to England. He spent the next three years trying to convince various aristocrats to back another wreck-salvaging venture which may have been a ruse; a former sailor who had served aboard the "Carlisle" later testified that "Breholt only acted behind the curtain, that his ill charectar might not defeat their reall design, which was to get out to sea and then to carry the said ships to Madagascar." In 1705 he returned to his plans to arrange a pardon for the Madagascar pirates who would bring their riches back with them, petitioning Queen Anne directly and claiming that he had ships ready to depart.
He tried to enlist the New East India Company’s help in 1707 and convinced Daniel Defoe to advocate for his plan; Edgerton once again backed his scheme. He organized over 40 pirate wives who had been left behind in England to petition in support of the plan as well, and produced a woman he claimed was the wife of legendary pirate Henry Every. Former Madagascar castaway John Benbow (son of Admiral Benbow) also spoke in support of the plan, confirming that the Madagascar pirates would accept a pardon.
Breholt was still pushing his Madagascar plan in 1709. Author Penelope Aubin (who had advised Breholt's backers during his failed 1702-1704 salvaging ploy), some of the pirate wives, and a former sailor aboard the "Carlisle" all testified that Breholt himself was a pirate and schemer; this plus a rival plan pushed by the Marquis of Carmarthen helped doom his efforts. After failing to get the South Sea Company to back his Madagascar plans, he turned to other efforts such as lighthouse-building and was not heard from again.

Gaw (surname)

Gaw is a surname with at least four different origins. First, it may be derived from the Gaelic word meaning "foreigner" or "stranger". The surnames Gall and Gaul are derived from the same word. In Brittany it became a surname for immigrants from France, in Lincolnshire for Bretons, in Perthshire and Aberdeen for Lowlanders. Second, it may have originated by shortening the name McGaw, which is an Anglicised form of meaning "son of Adam". Third, it may be an old spelling of the German surname Gau, which originated as a toponymic surname; see Gau (territory). Finally, it may be an Anglicisation of the Southern Min pronunciation of the Chinese surname pronounced Wú () in Mandarin; this spelling came into use in Hong Kong by a family of Chinese immigrants from Myanmar. 
The surname is relatively rare. There were 334 people on the island of Great Britain and 174 on the island of Ireland with the surname Gaw as of 2011, according to statistics cited by Patrick Hanks.

The arena would be located just south of SoFi Stadium, the home of the NFL's Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers, and the Hollywood Park development.
Features.
The 18,000-seat arena was designed by AECOM. In addition to the arena the venue will also include a practice facility, sports medicine clinic, team offices, retail space and a large outdoor plaza with basketball courts that will be open to the public.
The practice facility will be , the team offices and the sports medicine clinic . An additional are set aside for retail and for the outdoor plaza.
Competition with The Forum.
As the new venue could also host concerts, it was reasoned the Intuit Dome could provide direct competition with The Forum. Several lawsuits were filed to attempt to prevent the construction of the arena, which would ensure no nearby arena would compete with The Madison Square Garden Company-owned Forum. In December 2018, the Clippers filed a countersuit against The Madison Square Garden Company alleging that they tried to prevent competition with The Forum.
In March 2019, leaked emails revealed that Irving Azoff attempted to lure the Los Angeles Lakers back to The Forum after their lease at Staples Center was up. Despite nothing coming of the proposal, Azoff's proposal to re-purpose The Forum was seen as a way of preventing the LA Clippers from building their own arena in Inglewood and ensuring that the Madison Square Garden Company got an unfair advantage over rival AEG, which already owns part of the Lakers.
In November 2019, a judge tossed a lawsuit by Uplift Inglewood seeking to stop the arena's construction.
In December 2019, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) approved the new arena, after evaluating the arena's environmental impact.
In March 2020, Steve Ballmer announced his intent to purchase The Forum for $400 million, ending the lawsuit. The Forum will continue to host concerts, and all venue employees who held jobs under the Madison Square Garden Company were offered jobs by Ballmer. The Intuit Dome, with the lawsuits out of the way began construction as originally planned.
Construction.
On July 25, 2019, the Clippers released new images of the proposed arena. Construction started in summer 2021 and will be completed in fall 2024, following the expiration of the Clippers' lease with the Staples Center. The Clippers later announced the groundbreaking on their new $1.8 billion arena to be on September 17, 2021. 
On September 17, 2021, the team and software company Intuit announced a 23-year naming rights agreement, whereby the arena would be known as the Intuit Dome. On the same day, ground broke officially starting construction.

Kenneth Gärdestad

John Charles Kenneth Gärdestad (9 May 1948 – 3 March 2018) was a Swedish songwriter, best known for writing lyrics for the songs of his brother, Ted Gärdestad. He participated at Melodifestivalen 1979 as a songwriter for the winning song "Satellit" performed by his brother. The song went on to Eurovision the same year, where it placed 17th. Gärdestad was also an architect, affiliated to the private Kunskapsskolan, where he designed the interior of several of its high schools. Gärdestad published the biography "Jag vill ha en egen måne" in 2005. In later years he became a mental health activist, and created the "Ted Gärdestad Stipend", a prize awarded to amateur singers and songwriter.
Music career.
Gärdestad was a songwriter who co-wrote lyrics for many of his younger brother Ted Gärdestad's (1956–1997) songs. This included his Melodifestivalen song entries "Oh, vilken härlig dag" in 1973 and "Rockin' 'n' Reelin'" in 1975. As such, Gärdestad also won Melodifestivalen 1979 with Ted's song "Satellit". The song went on to represent Sweden in Eurovision 1979, finishing 17th during the final held in Jerusalem.
Gärdestad also competed in 2008 in the SVT music show "Doobidoo" along with Lotta Engberg. He took part again in Melodifestivalen in 2010, with lyrics for "Hur kan jag tro på kärlek?" performed by singer Erik Linder. The song placed fifth in the semi-final and was eliminated. In 2016, he was awarded the Musikförläggarnas pris, an honorary award for "many years of work for Swedish music and for creating timeless stories which he shares". In 2018, he won an honorary Grammis award, citing "his many years in the music industry and for his work in it, and many wonderful lyrics."
Tributes to his brother.
Gärdestad, with Keijo Liimatainen, wrote "Jag vill ha en egen måne" (2005), a biography about his brother Ted and the circumstances surrounding his suicide in 1997. In 2018, a biographical film about his brother, "", was released. Gärdestad took part in creating realistic scenes for the film and gave it his support. Peter Viitanen portrayed Kenneth Gärdestad in the film.
Gärdestad was a special guest on the show "Så mycket bättre" in 2016, which was broadcast on Swedish national television station TV4. The last episode of the 2016 season featured the season's chosen singers performing several of his brother's well-known hits, including "Helt nära dig" (interpreted by Little Jinder), "Sommarlängtan" (by Magnus Carlson), "Himlen är oskyldigt blå" (by Jill Johnson), "505 to Casablanca" (by Freddie Wadling), "Sol, vind och vatten" (by Lisa Ekdahl), "I den stora sorgens famn" (by Tommy Nilsson) and "För kärlekens skull" (by Danny Saucedo).
Architecture work.
Gärdestad was head architect at Kunskapsskolan from 2008 until his death, and designed many of the schools' rooms. Kunskapsskolan (literally "The Knowledge School") is a Swedish network of independent schools that provides education for students from grades 4 to 9 (ages 10 to 16). It also provides gymnasium schools for grades 10 to 12 (ages 16 to 19) in different areas of Sweden. Designed by Gärdestad, the architecture is very open, with glass and colourfully painted walls. There are 36 Kunskapskolan schools in Sweden.
Activism.
Gärdestad worked to educate and create understanding about psychological illness after his brother Ted's mental illness and suicide in 1997. He was the creator of the annual "Ted Gärdestad Stipend" awarded to amateur singers and songwriters since 1999 to promote their work. The prize includes a tribute concert.
Personal life.
Gärdestad's brother Ted was a noted Swedish singer who represented Sweden in Eurovision with one of Kenneth's songs. Their other brother Kjell (1944–2000) was also a songwriter who co-wrote the song "Viking" with Ted.
Death.
Kenneth Gärdestad revealed in 2014 that he was suffering from skin cancer and latent lymphoma. He died on 3 March 2018, aged 69.

Kusumamala

Kusumamala () is a collection of poems by Gujarati writer Narsinhrao Divetia published in 1887. It is considered Divetia's magnum opus and a milestone in the history of modern Gujarati poetry. The poems were written in the manner of English lyrical poetry. The work was well received by the new school writers while criticised by old school writers.
Origin.
Divetia was interested in and influenced by English romantic poetry, especially the work of William Wordsworth. He therefore wrote lyrics in the pattern of English lyrical poetry compiled in the "Palgrave's Golden Treasury". In the introduction to "Kusumamala", Divetia wrote:
Content.
The "Kusumamala" contains 62 poems on various subjects, including love, nature, social conditions, and historical places and events. The poems are written in various metres as well as in traditional and folk melodies and rhythms. The collection includes short and long poems, with some having nearly one hundred lines. The shortest poem is "Mangalacharan" ("The Auspicious Stanza"), which consists of just four lines, while the longest poem is "Chanda" ("The Moon"), consisting of 112 lines which are divided into 28 stanzas of four lines each. Some other long poems are "Asthir Ane Sthir Prem" ("Unsteady and Steady Love") (68 lines), "Vidhvano Vilap" ("The Lamentation of the Widow") (96 lines), and "Megh", a translation of "The Cloud" by English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (92 lines).
Reception.
The "Kusumamala" was well received by readers. Its first edition was published in 1887, followed by a second edition in 1902, third edition in 1907, and fourth edition in 1912.
The "Kusumamala" was received positively by the new or Western school writers but negatively by the old or orthodox school writers. Navalram Pandya's review was very short and terse. He found the verses, modelled as they were on those of Shelley and Wordsworth, were intended to give an idea to the Gujarati reader as to the sort of poetry the West produced. He praised the poems as being delightful and on the whole easy to understand, although the language and style were cultured (fully developed). "Kusumamala" received negative criticism from Manilal Nabhubhai Dwivedi, who called it "foreign exotic flowers, bright coloured but without beauty or fragrance, nothing better than a garland of flowers skilfully woven in obedience to the alluring vogue then prevalent of considering everything coming from the West worthy of imitation". Dwivedi criticised the collection for months in the "Priyamavada" and "Sudarshana" magazines which he edited, arousing controversy. Ramanbhai Neelkanth responded with a series of articles in "Jnan Sudha". He contested Dwivedi's criticism and hailed the collection as "an oasis in the desert of Gujarati poetic literature".
Manishankar Bhatt 'Kant' and Balwantray Thakore also criticised the collection, while Anandshankar Dhruv appreciated it. Govardhanram Tripathi quoted a few lines from "Chanda", a poem in "Kusumamala", in his epic novel "Saraswatichandra". Divetia's second poetry collection, "Hridayavina", aroused similar controversy.
Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi, in "Gujarat and Its Literature", noted that with "Kusumamala", Divetia launched the age of romantic poetry in the Gujarati language.

George Skirrow Beecroft

George Skirrow Beecroft (16 November 1809 – 18 March 1869) was a British Conservative Party politician and ironmaster.
Family.
Born in 1809, Beecroft was the son of George Beecroft and Mary Audus. He first married his cousin Septima Garland Butler, daughter of Thomas Butler and Anne Beecroft in 1835. Together, they had two children. The first died in infancy, and the second, Septima, died in 1868. His wife, Septima, died in 1837.
In 1842, he married to Mary Isabella Beaumont, daughter of George Beaumont. Together, they had two children: George Audus Beaumont (1844–1873) and Mary Alice, who died in infancy.
Early life.
Beecroft was educated for a mercantile life at Horton House, in Bradford, until he was 17. He then moved into the iron trade, working with his father and uncle, Thomas Butler (senior), at Kirkstall Forge, eventually becoming a partner.
In 1841, he entered into partnership with his cousins - John Octavius Butler, Thomas Butler (junior), and Ambrose Edward Butler - at Beecroft, Butler and Co, before retiring in 1855.
Political career.

He was elected a Liberal-Conservative - nominally a Conservative - MP for Leeds at a by-election in 1857 - with politics supporting the Church of England, encouraging popular education, and extending the franchise - and held the seat until he stood down at the 1868 general election, owing to ill health.
Other activities.
Beecroft was also a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire.

Mi Mala

"Mi Mala" (English: "My Mean Girl") is a single by Venezuelan duo Mau y Ricky and Colombian singer Karol G. The song was co-written by the duo, Karol G, Matluck, Jon Leone, Camilo Echeverry and its producer, Tainy. A remix version featuring Becky G, Lali and Leslie Grace was released on 9 February 2018.
Background.
The song was written by Mau y Ricky, Karol G, Camilo Echeverry, Max Matluck, Tainy and Jon Leone. It is about two people who don't want to be in a serious relationship with each other, so they know that the other sees other people, but they don't care.
Remix version.
On 9 February 2018 a remix version featuring vocals by American singer Becky G, Argentine singer Lali and Dominican singer Leslie Grace was released. Its music video was shot on 18 January 2018 in Miami, Florida, and was directed by David Bohórquez. The song received a nomination for Remix of the Year at the 31st edition of the Lo Nuestro Awards.
Background and composition.
For the remix, Mau y Ricky invited three more female voices. On the Spotify's exclusive behind the scenes, Ricky said "I think it's very important to support female talent, [so] it gets more powerful with the other ladies." Karol G admitted that she was "excited" about the song because it "is loyal to what [she]'s ever wanted with [her] project: give women reasons to feel inspired and great." Leslie Grace stated that "in the music industry, women are getting hold of their territory" and Lali added that "it's time for women to join". Finally, Becky G also expressed her excitement by saying: "we are this younger generation in music, and to be able to share the light is just incredible."
Becky G and Grace had previously worked together on their joint single "Díganle". The song peaked at number 13 on the "Billboard" Latin Digital Song Sales chart and was certified Latin platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America certification (RIAA). In 2011, Mau y Ricky ("MR" back then) had opened a show for Teen Angels, Lali's former group, at the Gran Rex Theatre in Buenos Aires.
Critical reception.
"Billboard" described the song as a "sizzling remix of the slow reggaeton jam." Additionally, Diana Marti from "E! Online" said that the track "is infectious and you'll find yourself leaving it on repeat." "Fuse"'s Jeff Benjamin added that "[the remix] is more than just a hot rework, it's a larger spotlight on the great female talent coming from the Latin music community and highlights the necessity to shed more light on it".
Music video.
The official music video was shot by director David Bohórquez in Miami, Florida on 18 January 2018. It premiered on Spotify's mobile app on 9 February 2018, on the newly relaunched ¡Viva Latino! playlist. Three days after, on 12 February, it made its premiere on Vevo. Bohórquez had previously directed the music video for the original version.
In the music video, Karol, Becky, Leslie and Lali all get to pose and smize for a camera recording them, but they're not doing it for Mau y Ricky's affection. Instead, the guys get to coolly hang out with their co-stars' faces projecting on screens. Furthermore, the diversity of Latin music's female superstars are on display here with all different kinds of body types, singing styles, fashion looks and hair colors are displayed by all four women who personify the exciting range of types of people around the world rocking the industry.

SMS V47

SMS "V47" was a Large Torpedo Boat ("Großes Torpedoboot") of the Imperial German Navy that was built and served during the First World War.
She served in the North Sea and English Channel during the war, and was scuttled on 2 November 1918.
Construction.
"V47" was the fifth ship in the second batch of six "V25"-class torpedo boats ("V43"–"V48") ordered from AG Vulcan for the Imperial German Navy on 22 April 1914, as part of the last peacetime order for torpedo boats before the outbreak of the First World War. In March 1915, it was decided to lengthen "V47" and , still under construction, by in order to increase oil bunkerage and hence the range of the ship. She was launched as Yard number 362 on 10 June 1915 and completed on 20 November 1915.
"V47" was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draft of . Displacement was normal and deep load. Three oil-fired water-tube boilers fed steam to 2 sets of AEG-Vulcan steam turbines rated at , giving a speed of . of fuel oil was carried, giving a range of at .
Armament originally consisted of three 8.8 cm SK L/45 naval guns in single mounts, together with six 50 cm (19.7 in) torpedo tubes with two fixed single tubes forward and 2 twin mounts aft. Up to 24 mines could be carried. In 1916 the 8.8 cm guns were replaced by three 10.5 cm SK L/45 naval guns. The ship had a complement of 87 officers and men.
Service.
In November 1915, "V47" was one of three new large torpedo boats (the others were and ) from III Torpedo Boat Flotilla allocated to reinforce the surface forces of the German Navy based in Flanders, which 
were equipped with the small and lightly armed A-I class coastal torpedo boats, which were outclassed by larger British and French destroyers. Issues with manning the torpedo boats delayed their dispatch to Belgium, and they did not reach Zeebrugge until 3 March 1916, forming the Flanders Destroyer Half Flotilla.
On 20 March 1916, Allied aircraft carried out large-scale air attack against German air-bases in the Zeebrugge region, with 50 British, French and Belgian bombers attacking the airfield at Houtlave, near Zeebrugge, while the seaplane carriers and launched their aircraft against the seaplane base on Zeebrugge Mole. Four British destroyers, , , and , were deployed on air-sea rescue duties to pick up any British aircraft that ditched during the attack. A German seaplane spotted two of these destroyers off the West Hinder lighthouse at about 7:00 am, and the three torpedo boats of the Flanders Half Flotilla set out to attack them. The torpedo boats caught up with "Lance" and "Linnet" at 8:38 am and pursued them to the west until the other two British destroyers joined in. "Lance" was hit twice by German shells, while both "V47" and "V68" were hit on the bow by British shells, before the German ships withdrew under the cover of German coastal artillery. On 24 May 1916, the British started laying a mine and net barrage off the Belgian coast to stop the activities of German minelaying submarines of the Flanders Flotilla, with the operations supported by destroyers of the Dover Patrol and Harwich Force, the monitors and and a large force of drifters. The three torpedo boats of the Flanders Half Flotilla sortied against the operation on the afternoon of 24 May, and clashed with the British destroyers , , and . The torpedo boats retreated towards the coast with the four destroyers in pursuit, hitting "Melpomene" in the engine room before the German shore batteries opened fire on the British destroyers. The hit on "Melpomene" flooded her engine room, disabling her, with "Milne" and "Medea" taking the stricken destroyer in tow, while under heavy fire from the shore batteries. The three German torpedo boats then attacked the British destroyers, but were driven off by fire from the two monitors.
In June–July 1916, the Flanders-based forces were temporarily reinforced by the large destroyers of II Flotilla, and it was decided to use the arrival of this force to drive off patrolling British destroyers and allow the minefields to be cleared. The torpedo boats of the Flanders Half Flotilla were to act as bait and draw the British destroyers eastwards towards the arriving destroyers of II Flotilla. At 6:25am on 8 June the Flanders Half Flotilla encountered five British destroyers, and as planned, turned east with the British in pursuit. "V67" was hit and disabled, and was taken under tow by "V47", with the arrival of II Flotilla forcing the British destroyers to turn back and saving the Flanders Half Flotilla.
Battle of the Dover Strait.
On October 1916, the Flanders based forces were again reinforced, this time by III and IX Flotillas. The combined force was planned to operate against the Dover Barrage, a system of nets, minefields and patrols deployed by the British to stop German submarines passing through the Dover Strait, and to directly attack transports in the Channel. The two flotillas safely reached Belgium on the morning of 24 October.
The Germans launched their attack on the night of 26/27 October. The torpedo boats of III Flotilla were to attack the patrol boats of the Dover Barrage, with the 5th Half Flotilla, ("V47", "V67", "V68", , and ) operating on the Northern side of the Channel and the 6th Half-flotilla operating to the south, while IX Flotilla was to sneak past the patrols and attack merchant shipping in the Channel. The 5th Half-Flotilla began its attacks on the British patrol line at about 10:10 pm, when it attacked the five Drifters of the 10th Drifter Division, sinking three of them ("Spotless Prince", "Datum" and "Gleaner of the Sea" and damaging a fourth, , which was set on fire. At about 11:10 the 5th Half-Flotilla encountered the 8th Drifter Division, sinking two drifters and then the 16th Division, sinking another two drifters and badly damaging a third, before setting course for home.
Meanwhile the old British destroyer , patrolling in support of the drifters, stopped to rescue the crew of "Waveney II" and was caught by surprise by the torpedo boats of the 6th Half Flotilla and sunk by gunfire. One transport, was caught and sunk by the torpedo boats of the 9th Flotilla, and the British destroyer , which had set out from Dover in response to the attacks on the drifters, was torpedoed and badly damaged by the torpedo boats of the 9th Flotilla.
On 3 November 1916, III Flotilla was ordered to return to Germany, but IX Flotilla and the Flanders Half Flotilla remained. On 23 November, the torpedo boats of IX Flotilla and the Destroyer Half Flotilla, including "V47" made a sortie against the Downs, but found it empty of shipping. They carried out a raid into the southern part of the North Sea on the night of 26 November, sinking an armed trawler, the "Narval", although the torpedo boats and collided and were badly damaged.
1917.
On 25 February the German forces based in Flanders, which had been heavily reinforced during the previous month, launched a major raid against Allied defences and shipping in the Channel. One group of five torpedo boats (the 1st Zeebrugge half-flotilla – "V47", "V67", "V68", and ) were to operate against shipping near the North Foreland lighthouse and The Downs, while a second group of six torpedo boats of VI Flotilla were to attack the patrol boats of the Dover Barrage, while three more torpedo boats were to attack shipping off the mouth of the River Maas. "V47" s group carried out a brief bombardment of the North Foreland and Margate before withdrawing, hitting a house and killing three civilians but doing little other damage. The attack on the Dover Barrage withdrew after a confrontation with the British destroyer , while the patrol off the Mass encountered no ships.
The next major raid on the Channel took place on the night of March 17/18 1917. Two groups of torpedo boats, the seven ships of VI Flotilla and the five ships of the 1st Zeebrugge half-flotilla ("V47", "V67", "V68", "G95" and "G96") were to operate against the Dover Barrage, with the 6th Flotilla attacking on the Northern side of the Channel and the 1st Zeebrugge Half-Flotilla operating to the south. Four more torpedo boats would attack shipping on the Downs. The 6th Flotilla encountered the British destroyer ,on patrol in the Channel, and opened fire with guns and torpedoes. "Paragon" was hit by at least two torpedoes and sank. On seeing the explosion, , the next destroyer in the British patrol line, proceeded southwards to investigate, and had just switched on her searchlight to rescue survivors when she was torpedoed and badly damaged by ships of VI Flotilla, which escaped to the east, joining up with the torpedo boats of the 1st Zeebrugge half-flotilla, including "V47". The attack on the Downs sank a small steamer, the "Greypoint" and attacked several drifters on patrol.
The Flanders-based torpedo boat flotillas continued to launch sorties against the Channel, with the next encounter with the Royal Navy occurring on the night of April 20/21. Six torpedo boats ("Group Gautier") were to bombard Dover and attack the Dover Barrage on the north side of the channel, with six more ("Group Albrecht" – "V47", "V68", , , "G95" and "G96" were to attack Calais and the southern part of the barrage. Three more torpedo boats were to operate near the Downs. "Group Albrecht" arrived off Calais at about 23:15 hr and fired about 300 shells before withdrawing. "Group Gautier" fired on and damaged an armed trawler, the "Sabreur", and ineffectually shelled Dover. On the return journey they were intercepted by the British destroyers and which sank the torpedo boats and .
Fate.
When the Allied advance in the Autumn of 1918 forced the Germans to evacuate the Flanders ports, "V47" was unable to evacuate and was scuttled.

Belt Hill Conservation Park

Belt Hill Conservation Park is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Thornlea about south-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about north west of the town centre in Hatherleigh.
The conservation park occupies land in section 339 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Rivoli Bay. In 1971, the land was offered by its owner, A. McArthur of Rendelsham, to the “then National Parks Commission” for “dedication as a Reserve.” On 27 April 1972, it was proclaimed as the Belt Hill Conservation Park when the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972" came into force. As of 2016, it covered an area of .
In 1990, the conservation park was described as consisting of “a consolidated calcarenite dune overlain by weakly-structured sandy soils” that “extends from the east” with a “swale or low-lying plainwhich continues into adjacent farmland” on its western side. The vegetation cover was described as consisting of “an open scrub formation” of silver-leaved banksia, blackwood, and golden wattle” on the dune with “mainly introduced pasture grasses with some kangaroo grass… and knobby club-rush… covering the swale in the west. It was reported that native vegetation within the conservation park “has been considerably disturbed mainly through grazing by stock and rabbits” and during the early 1950s, a “row of pine trees was planted on the southern boundary to control sand drift”.
In 1990, it was reported that two archaeological sites are located on the dune as evident by a “thin scatter of artefacts” on its surface. It is speculated that “the area supported a substantial Aboriginal population as it is elevated, well sheltered and watered, and would have offered many sources of food.” Also, there was an abandoned stone quarry on the southern side of the conservation park and a sand pit in its north from which material was extracted for road construction by state government agencies.
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area.

Meghan Duffy

Meghan Anne Duffy is an American biologist and associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Michigan. She focuses on the causes and consequences of parasitism in natural populations of lake populations. In 2019, she created a task force to examine factors that influence the mental health and well-being of graduate students at the University of Michigan.
Education.
Duffy earned a Bachelors Biological Sciences from Cornell University in 2000. She completed her graduate studies at Kellogg Biological Station and Michigan State University. She was awarded a PhD in Zoology and Ecology, Evolutionary Biology and Behavior in 2006.
Career and research.
In 2006, she was appointed an National Science Foundation (NSF) postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Wisconsin. In 2008 she joined Georgia Tech as an assistant professor. She worked on the parasites that feed on small freshwater crustaceans ("Daphnia"), using them as a "model system for understanding host-parasite interactions in general". She found that ecological context was important when gauging epidemic size, and that when some parasites are "battling an epidemic of a deadly parasite, less resistance can sometimes be better than more". In 2012 she won the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, which was presented to her by Barack Obama.
Duffy joined University of Michigan in 2012. Her research concentrates on rapid evolutionary responses in novel host-parasite associations. She is currently researching the influences of food webs and eco-evolutionary dynamics on host-parasite interactions and multi-host, multi-parasite interactions. Duffy is concerned about cuts to basic research funding.
Public engagement.
Duffy established the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) Mentor Match, which pairs undergraduate students from minority-serving institutions with mentors to help with graduate school and fellowship applications. Duffy created Diversity EEB"," a list of ecologists / evolutionary biologists who are women or from a group traditionally underrepresented in the sciences to help people identify scientists who might diversify seminar series or for award nominations. Duffy is one of the 2017/2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science Leshner Leadership Institute Public Engagement Fellows. She is interested in how scientists can engage with policy makers. She delivered the opening address at the 2017 March for Science. In 2017, Duffy ran a workshop for high school students on the University of Michigan Wolverine Pathways program, teaching students how to find and use open data to answer questions that they are interested in. She is one of three contributors to the science blog Dynamic Ecology.
In October 2017, Duffy won the University of Michigan President's Award for Public Impact, for being "a leading national voice in promoting the crucial importance of diversity, equity and inclusion in the STEM disciplines". She won the 2010 George Mercer Award from the Ecological Society of America, and the 2017 Yentsch-Schindler Early Career Award from the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography.

Cyclone Kelvin

Severe Tropical Cyclone Kelvin was a strong tropical cyclone that impacted Western Australia in February 2018, causing moderate damage. The system was first identified as a weak tropical low on the morning of 11 February over the Northern Territory's Tiwi Islands by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). The low moved southwestwards over land and emerged over the Indian Ocean near Broome on 16 February. The storm intensified into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the following day, becoming the sixth named storm of the 2017–18 Australian region cyclone season. Kelvin subsequently moved slowly eastwards and began to rapidly intensify in the hours prior to landfall. On 18 February, the storm crossed the coast along Eighty Mile Beach as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, and a high-end Category 1 hurricane-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Despite being over land, Kelvin weakened at a slow rate over the next few days, and was downgraded to a tropical low on 19 February. The remnant low of the system drifted over the Outback before being last noted by BoM on 21 February.
Kelvin brought widespread heavy rainfall to the Kimberley region which had already been saturated by other tropical cyclones earlier in the season. As a result, significant flooding occurred in parts of the Kimberley, including in the towns of Broome, which recorded a record annual rainfall total following the storm, and Kalumburu. Property damage was sustained at Broome and Nita Downs, where the cyclone made landfall. Additionally, the Great Northern Highway sustained infrastructural damage as a result of the heavy rainfall and flooding, cutting off access to the towns and leading to a shortage of supplies. Repairs were estimated to take months. Pastoral stations were heavily affected by the cyclone, including Anna Plains Station, which sustained property damage, and Mandora Station, half of which was completely flooded. Overall, Cyclone Kelvin incurred an estimated AUS$25 million ($25 million in 2018 USD) in losses.
Meteorological history.
During the morning of 11 February, the Bureau of Meteorology identified a developing tropical low pressure system near the Tiwi Islands, off the northwest coast of the Northern Territory. During the following days, the low, designated "17U", tracked over land on a general west-southwesterly course, gradually intensifying. As the system approached the coast, the BoM began issuing warnings on it, and forecast the low to potentially strengthen to a category 3 severe tropical cyclone over the following days. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the low around this time. The system emerged over the Indian Ocean at about 8:00 am AWST on 16 February; however, contrary to previous forecasts, it was generally slow to develop.
About twelve hours later, the JTWC assessed the storm as having attained one-minute sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph); hence, the agency upgraded it to Tropical Storm 10S at 8:00 pm AWST. The cyclone continued to slowly strengthen, and was upgraded to a category 1 tropical cyclone by the BoM at 2:00 pm AWST on the following day, whereupon it was named "Kelvin". Tropical Cyclone Kelvin's movement speed slowed considerably at this stage, and it proceeded to turn sharply to the east. Aided by favorable environmental conditions, the system began to rapidly strengthen as it approached the north coast of Western Australia. This intensification, fueled by a strong Rossby wave, continued until landfall.
Kelvin ultimately made landfall near Anna Plains Station along Eighty Mile Beach at 8:00 am AWST on 18 February as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, with 10-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph), and a minimum central barometric pressure of 955 hPa (28.20 inHg). The JTWC assessed the system as a high-end category 1 hurricane-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson scale, with one-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph). After making landfall, Tropical Cyclone Kelvin turned to the south-southeast, and tracked inland over the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Despite losing the ocean as its primary source of energy, the cyclone was slow to weaken; this was partially due to the flat nature of the terrain and possibly a result of the brown ocean effect as well.
The system was downgraded to tropical low intensity by the BoM at 2:00 pm AWST on 19 February, after approximately 30 hours over the flat desert terrain of Western Australia. Gale-force winds did persist in the southeastern quadrant, however. The remnant low was last noted by the BoM at 2:00 pm AWST on 21 February as it was drifting over the Outback. Unlike the BoM, the JTWC maintained the system's classification as a tropical storm for another 36 hours after this, only declaring Kelvin dissipated at 2:00 am AWST on 21 February. The remnant moisture of the system continued to track south-southeastwards across the Nullarbor Plains on 22 February, and then emerged over the Great Australian Bight shortly afterward.
Impacts.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Kelvin and its precursor low brought widespread heavy rainfall to the regions of Western Australia across which it tracked. These parts of Australia had already experienced record rainfall totals prior to the arrival of Kelvin, with significant amounts being delivered by Tropical Cyclone Hilda, Tropical Cyclone Joyce, and Tropical Low 11U.
After Tropical Low 17U's formation, a tropical cyclone watch was issued for residents between Kuri Bay and Whim Creek, while a blue alert was issued for residents between Kuri Bay and Wallal, advising residents to be prepared for the upcoming storm. On the next day, Kununurra received 100 mm (3.9 in) of rain and Wyndham received gusts of 80 km/h (50 mph).
Prior to Kelvin's landfall, as it was hugging the coast at the time, Australian authorities issued a yellow alert in the area between Broome and Pardo Roadhouse, which advised residents to take shelter as soon as possible. Sustained gales were recorded north of Broome Port from 11:16 am to 2:11 pm AWST on 16 February. Broome Airport received 376.8 mm (14.8 in) of precipitation in the 24 hours prior to 9:00 am on 17 February, while West Roebuck received 370.0 mm (14.6 in) during this time. Around this time, Kelvin caused a house to be inundated with floodwater. Two wastewater plants overflowed, causing the Water Corporation to issue bans on fishing and swimming at Roebuck Bay and Dampier Creek. By 09:00 am on the next day, Nita Downs received 235.0 mm (9.25 in) and Wallal Downs received 223.5 mm (8.8 in) of rain. A red alert was issued for the residents from Bidyadanga to Sandfire, Western Australia as Cyclone Kelvin made landfall on 18 February, which ordered residents to go into shelters immediately. A cattle farmer reported property damage estimated to be AUS$150,000. By 9:00 am on 19 February, Broome recorded a record annual rainfall total of 1506.0 mm (59.3 in), despite being less than two months into the calendar year. In addition to the heavy precipitation, Kelvin also generated a 0.5 metre (1.6 foot) storm surge at Broome Port, and higher-than-normal ocean tides were recorded in Cable Beach. The heavy rainfall caused the already saturated water catchments in the region to overflow, and significant flooding ensued in areas such as Broome, Roebuck Plains, Logue River, Kalumburu and along the Great Northern Highway.
Fallen trees and property damages were reported at Anna Plains Station and Nita Downs, where the cyclone made landfall. Minor damages was also reported in Broome as well. Infrastructural damage in excess of AUS$16 million (US$12.7 million) also occurred along the Great Northern Highway due to the heavy rainfall and flooding. The flooding caused some parts of the highway to be closed, especially between Broome and Roebuck Plains, as well as between Willare and Sandfire roadhouses. The closure cut off the supply chain between towns in Kimberley and caused shortages of food supplies in the region. Repairs were estimated to take months, due to repeated impacts from previous cyclones, which weakened road infrastructure. A bridge along the highway across the Logue River that had been damaged by previous cyclones was overtopped by flooding yet again, setting back progress in repairing the bridge and lengthening its closure. Initial repairs to the bridge ultimately cost AUS$2 million, and permanent repairs were estimated to cost AUS$16 million. Due to flooding, a man was stranded in Eco Beach Resort and had to be airlifted. More than half of Mandora Station was inundated by flooding.
Even as Kelvin weakened to a tropical low, thunderstorms impacted southern parts of the state. Cascade received 106 mm (4.2 in) of rainfall, Scaddan received 85 mm (3.3 in), Grass Patch 65 mm (2.5 in), and parts of Esperance about 50 mm (2 in). Overall, Cyclone Kelvin in caused an estimated AUS$25 million ($25 million in 2018 USD) in losses throughout Australia.
In the aftermath of the storm, floodwaters quickly hampered the relief efforts to the areas impacted by the cyclone. Western Australia Department of Fire and Emergency Services had to charter a plane and dropped supplies from the plane to the Aboriginal Australians in Dampier Peninsula and Anna Plains Station as part of disaster assistance efforts. These efforts, which were jointly funded by the Australian federal government and state government of Western Australia, were made available to Laverton, Wyndham–East Kimberley, Derby–West Kimberley and Broome local government areas. Volunteers from State Emergency Service (SES) also took charter planes to assist efforts in Eighty Mile Beach region.

Ryūsen-zu

Ryūsen-zu 流宣図 is a style of woodblock print maps created by the ukiyo-e artist and popular writer (jp) in the Edo period in Japan.
History.
The term Ryūsen-zu refers to maps composed by , but it is usually specifically used to mean Japanese provincial maps made by him. As an epoch-making map style, publishers reproduced or reprinted these maps over and over from the late seventeenth century to the mid-eighteenth century, until another popular map style, Sekisui-zu (a map style developed by a geographer, ,(jp) appeared. Whereas Sekisui pursued geographic accuracy in his maps, Ryūsen created a variety of cartographic productions based on the imagination and experience of an artist and a writer. added new contents to his maps to make attracting productions for the consumers.
The features of Ryūsen-zu suggest that a prototype of Ryūsen-zu was kuniezu. According to the exhibition catalogue "Cartography in Japan: Official Maps Past and Present", Ryūsen-zu was a remodel of "Keichō kuniezu", published in 1605. Provincial mapmaking was initially a political project by the Tokugawa shogunate. The purpose of the map projects was to enable the government to share official information, such as the locations of domains and provinces, the names of feudal lords, and the feudal lords’ annual incomes, to show off their power. The provincial maps also included big cities, major roads, stations, shipping routes, major mountains, rivers, and other geographic landmarks, but Ryūsen-zu was not simply a provincial map. It should avoid assuming that provincial maps made by an individual artist had the same nature as provincial maps composed by shogunal mapmakers for the style.
Style.
Another prototype of Ryūsen-zu is chizu byōbu (jp) (Japanese or folded screens bearing a Japanese provincial map or the world map). The early Ryūsen-style Japanese maps were mostly in the form of byōbu instead of on a sheet of paper. From this standpoint, it makes perfect sense that, as an ukiyo-e painter, stressed aesthetic values rather than the topographic accuracy of his maps, particularly in his early works. The maps consist mainly of three islands—Honshū, Shikoku, and Kyūshu—shaped by unique wavy coastlines. Ryūsen embedded these islands in a horizontally oblong rectangular frame as a screen panel and used color-coding to differentiate domains, sea, mountains, and other symbols in his maps. Ryūsen produced a multi-color print version, a hand-tinted version, or a black and white version.
 originally produced maps of Japan as artworks, but the reception of readers could change the original purpose of works. In fact, Ryūsen’s maps played to popular audiences and that his map productions were pastiches of the various kinds of published geographical information (e.g., the stations of major routes, shipping routes, a distance table from Edo, or a turntable of tides) that would have been available in the late seventeenth century.

Cupola (geology)

In geology, a cupola is an upward protrusion from the roof of a large igneous intrusion, such as a batholith. It may also refer to small outlying igneous bodies which may connect at depth with larger igneous masses. Cupola-type magma chambers might form above larger basaltic magma bodies and differentiate to create intermediate or felsic magmas, which in turn may reach the surface to produce small eruptions of intermediate or felsic lava.

Political Victory Fund

The Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) is the political action committee (PAC) of the National Rifle Association (NRA). The Fund contributes money to political campaigns of candidates endorsed by the NRA.
Chairman.
Chris W. Cox, who has been the NRA's chief lobbyist and principal political strategist since 2002, is also the NRA-PVF chairman, and "has directed NRA’s electoral efforts at every level."
History.
With passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968, an increasing number of NRA members, who has previously downplayed gun control issues, became more involved in gun politics and gun rights. Along with the creation of its lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA), with activist Harlon Carter as director, in 1976 the NRA established its non-partisan political action committee (PAC), the Political Victory Fund, in time for the 1976 elections. 
The NRA-PVF endorsed Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential campaign, the first NRA presidential endorsement.
By 1998, the NRA-PVF ranked as "one of the biggest spenders in congressional elections".
In the 2004 elections, 95% of the NRA-PVF endorsed federal candidates and 86% of the endorsed state candidates were elected. 
By 2008, during the elections, the PVF spent millions "on direct campaign donations, independent campaign expenditures and on mobilizing the most aggressive grassroots operation in NRA history." In 2012, NRA-PVF income was $14.4 million and expenses were $16.1 million. By 2014, the NRA-PVF income rose to $21.9 million with expenses of $20.7 million.
Mandate.
The NRA-PVF political action committee (PAC) was established in 1976 as a NRA subsidiary. The NRA-PVF created a rating system for political candidates to measure their support for gun-rights. It also helps its members locate an NRA Election Volunteer Coordinator (EVC) for their area and to register to vote.
Rating political candidates.
Through the Political Victory Fund, the NRA began to rate political candidates "irrespective of party affiliation - based on voting records, and public statements" on their positions on gun rights on a point scale of A+ to F. An NRA "A+" candidate, such as Todd Tiahrt, is one who has "not only an excellent voting record on all critical NRA issues, but who has also made a vigorous effort to promote and defend the Second Amendment", whereas an NRA "F" candidate is a "true enemy of gun owners' rights". 
Mike Spies, who has been reporting on the gun lobby since 2015, wrote a series called "The Gunfighters", which investigated the influence of the National Rifle Association (NRA) on state gun policy and politics. In his March 17, 2016 article published in "The Trace", Mike Spies described how the NRA began to use their scoring system to influence judicial nominations. The first attempt was during the confirmation proceedings of Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 at the request of Mitch McConnell and again in 2010 with Elena Kagan. In 2011, the NRA opposed Caitlin Halligan's nomination to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and as a result, Senate Republicans blocked her confirmation. In 2016, the NRA opposed the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court because he did not "respect the individual right to bear arms" - in 2007, Garland had "cast a vote in favor of allowing his court to review a crucial opinion by a three-judge panel that had found D.C.’s handgun ban unconstitutional." This article was cited in "The Second Amendment and Gun Control: Freedom, Fear, and the American Constitution" which presented both sides of the debate between those who "favour more gun controls and those who would prefer fewer of them."

Sir Frederick Henniker, 2nd Baronet

Sir Frederick Henniker (1 November 1793 – 6 August 1825) was a traveller and author.
Family and friends.
He was the eldest son of the Hon. Sir Brydges Henniker, 1st Baronet of Newton Hall in Great Dunmow by his wife Mary, eldest daughter of William Press, and a grandson of John Henniker, 1st Baron Henniker. He was educated at Eton and at St. John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1815. He succeeded his father as second baronet on 3 July 1816.
Scientist and inventor Francis Ronalds, who had a similar sense of adventure and wit, was one of his friends. Henniker’s uncle Lord John Henniker-Major FRS was a scientific mentor to Ronalds, and had viewed his pioneering electric telegraph in operation.
Travels.
In the period 1818–21 Henniker travelled through France and Italy to Malta, and thence to Alexandria, Upper Egypt and Nubia. After revisiting Cairo he went to Mount Sinai and Jerusalem, returning home by Smyrna, Athens, Constantinople, and Vienna. While on his way from Jerusalem to Jericho he was severely wounded by banditti, and left stark naked. He had met up with Ronalds in Sicily but not, as planned, in Egypt, Ronalds being delayed by financial and passport issues.
In 1823 Henniker published an account of his travels and a second edition appeared, with a slightly altered title, in the following year. Ronalds assisted with the draft and in analysing objects Henniker had brought home. Some of Henniker’s sketches and notes are held in the Ronalds Archive at the Institution of Engineering and Technology.
Politics.
In the spring of 1825 he canvassed Reading with a view of contesting that borough in the event of a dissolution, but withdrew his candidature, and died soon after in the Albany, Piccadilly, in the thirty-second year of his age. He was buried at Great Dunmow, Essex. He was unmarried, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his brother, the Hon. and Rev. Sir Augustus Brydges Henniker, 3rd Baronet.

Maqluba (Malta)

Il-Maqluba (meaning "overturned " or "upside-down" in Maltese) is a sinkhole with a surface area of around situated in the village of Qrendi in Malta. Il-Maqluba is a Special Area of Conservation – Candidate Site of International Importance and designated as a Tree Protection Area, forming part of Natura 2000 sites, a network of nature protection areas within the European Union, also earning the European Destination of Excellence title bestowed onto the locality by the European Union’s Commission for Tourism.
Visitors are forbidden to venture down to the bottom-most level of the sinkhole, but can admire the sinkhole from a viewing belvedere mid way down into the Maqluba.
Geological formation.
Like all sinkholes, this cavity was formed by the collapse of a limestone floor situated above a cavity hollowed out by water flowing in a karstic relief. The diameter is around 50m, and the depth is around 15m, the area approximately and the perimeter 300m. It is composed of blue clay and globigerina limestone that top the lower coralline limestone or żonqor. The area is a place of natural interest formed via the power of storm water runoff water which percolated through cracks and crevices. This gradual, yet constant, penetration created caverns which became larger with the passing of time thus producing a hollow that was eventually unable to support the overlying top layer, which eventually collapsed and created the doline that can be seen today.
Appearance of the cavity.
The cavity appeared violently on 23 November 1343 during a violent storm, or possibly an earthquake.
Legends.
The spectacular formation is at the origin of numerous legends. One of them recounts that the place was inhabited by people who lived such dissolute lives that a neighbour warned them against their sinful ways, without them taking notice. God therefore wished to punish the sinners by engulfing the hamlet, saving only the wise neighbour. The angels then threw a fragment into the sea, creating the isle of Filfla. A variant of this legend speaks of a nun as saved while praying in the small San Mattew Crypt during the occurrence. 
the St Matthew's Chapels.
A chapel consecrated to Saint Matthew was built on the edge of the sinkhole, and has been in existence since at least the 14th century, probably dating back to the 11th century.
Flora and fauna.
Dominant trees identified in this site include the laurel tree (siġra tar-rand) not too widely found in the Maltese islands; the fig tree (siġra tat-tin), the pomegranate tree (siġra tar-rummien) the carob tree (siġra tal-ħarrub), the hawthorn (siġra tal-anżalor) along with reeds (qasab) and the bramble (għollieq).
One particular species that merits special mention is the sandarac gum tree (siġra tal-għargħar) which naturally occurs in North Africa, Southern Spain, and in Malta growing only at Maqluba and Imġiebagħ and in the Mellieha area
Under these trees other plants thrive such as the large-leafed nettle (ħurrieq) and the cleavers (ħarxajja komuni). On the sides of the Maqluba many other flora species cling to the steep rocky flanks that enclose this depression. Thus one notices the Maltese salt tree (xebb), the ivy (liedna) and the caper (kappara), but also the prickly pear (bajtra tax-xewk) and the omnipresent Bermuda buttercup (ħaxixa Ingliża) along with many other plants.
The list of fauna identified in the Maqluba is also interesting especially as some of these creatures are endemic to Malta, including a number of species of beetle, slug, types of rare ants, a rare woodlouse including the grey long-eared bats and free-tailed bats, known to inhabit this zone.
Natural environment.
The sinkhole is the only one in Malta that is not covered in sediment. The natural environment is protected and integrated in the list of Natura 2000 in Malta. Dense scrubland is dominated by laurel and includes the presence of Malta's national tree, "Tetraclinis articulata", known in Maltese as "għargħar", as well as Maltese "Salsola", ("Salsola melitensis"), an endemic species on the archipelago. The sinkhole is also a nesting site for the national bird of Malta, the blue rock thrush ("Monticola solitarius").
The site is open to visitors.

Sarah Irving is the Executive Vice President and Chief Brand Officer of Irving Oil, a Canadian oil refinery and member company of the Irving Group of Companies, since 2015. She is the granddaughter of K.C. Irving, and heir to billionaire Arthur Irving with an estimated net worth of US$7.01 billion. As the only member of the Irving family running the company, it is suggested that Sarah Irving will eventually succeed ownership.
Irving serves as an adviser to Dartmouth College's "Dartmouth College Fund", the school's primary source of financial aid, and on the Board of Governors for the Rothesay Netherwood School. She is also a board trustee for the IWK Foundation.
Business career.
Upon graduating from Dartmouth College in 2010, Irving worked as a strategy consultant for Deloitte in New York for two years before returning to school to receive her MBA. Upon graduating, Irving joined Ian Whitcomb, previously a partner at Deloitte, to lead the family-owned petroleum products refiner and distributor, Irving Oil.
She is currently on the leadership team of Irving Oil, as the company's Executive Vice President and Chief Brand Officer. In addition, Irving becomes the second of Arthur Irving's children (his eldest son, Kenneth, was President of Irving Oil for a decade but abruptly left in 2010 ) to hold a senior position at the company, suggesting a possible succession plan at Irving Oil, in which Sarah Irving will take over the privately owned business.
As Chief Brand Officer, Irving has led several initiatives to improve the oil company's community image, such as raising $300,000 to help defray hospital travel costs with the company's seven partner hospitals across Canada and New England. She has also served as the key note speaker for a charity auction hosted by the Junior Achievement branch in Canada. Additionally, Irving served as the key note speaker at the East Coast Energy Connection conference, in which she described the critical role that Saint John, Canada played in the future of Irving Oil.
In 2016, Irving was listed as one of Canada's most powerful business people.
Education.
Irving graduated from the Rothesay Netherwood School in 2006, where she currently serves as a Governor. In 2010, Irving received a Bachelor of Arts degree (cum laude) from Dartmouth College, where she rowed division 1 crew and competed at the NCAA Division I Rowing Championship. In 2014, Irving received a Masters in Business Administration from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.
Personal.
In 2016, Irving, Irving Oil, her family, and the Arthur L. Irving Family Foundation made a lead gift of $80 million to Dartmouth College, founding the "Arthur L. Irving Institute for Energy and Society". The donation was considered controversial by alumni of the college given the conflict of interest between Irving Oil and the center's mission of tackling global energy issues. In addition, an opinion article in The Dartmouth directly criticized Irving for funding the institute.

Epirus (Roman province)

The province of Epirus (, ) was a province of the Roman Empire, covering the region of Ancient Epirus. Rome first annexed the region in 167 BC, in the aftermath of the Third Macedonian War, and initially put the region in the larger Roman province of Macedonia, which at the time covered the whole of the Hellenistic world in mainland Europe. In 27 BC, Epirus and Achaea were separated from Macedonia and grouped into the senatorial province of Achaea, with the exception of its northernmost part, which remained part of the province of Macedonia. Under Emperor Trajan, sometime between 103 and 114 AD, Epirus became a separate province, under a "procurator Augusti". The new province extended from the Gulf of Aulon (Vlorë) and the Acroceraunian Mountains in the north to the lower course of the Acheloos River in the south, and included the northern Ionian Islands of Corfu, Lefkada, Ithaca, Cephallonia, and Zakynthos.
History.
Rome had maintained a military presence in Epirus since the First Macedonian War, when it used Epirus as an entry-point for Roman troops in Greece. Rome would continue to use Epirus as a gateway for its troops in the Second and Third Macedonian Wars. During the third war, the hitherto neutral Epirote League split, with the Molossians siding with the Macedonians and the Chaonians and Thesprotians supporting the Romans. The war ended disastrously for Epirus - 150,000 Molossians were enslaved and the region fell to Rome.
The status of the region between 167 and 146 BC is unclear, but in 146 BC, it was grouped in the larger Roman province of Macedonia. During Caesar's Civil War, Julius Caesar used Bouthroton as a naval base, and later drew up plans for a colony there for his civil war veterans shortly before his death. Augustus later took up these plans and made the city a colony for his own veterans, after his victory over Mark Antony in the final Roman civil war. New residents expanded the city and the construction included an aqueduct, a Roman bath, houses, a forum complex and a nymphaeum. During this period, the size of the town was doubled. A number of new structures were built next to the existing ones, especially around the theatre and the temple of Asklepios.
Augustus also separated Epirus and Achaea from Macedonia in 27 BC, but it remained part of the province of Achaea until sometime between 104 and 117 AD, when Trajan made it a province in its own right.
"Epirus Vetus" and "Epirus Nova".
Sometime during the provincial reorganization by Diocletian (r. 284–305), the western portion of the province of Macedonia along the Adriatic coast was split off into the province of New Epirus (). Although this territory was not traditionally part of Epirus proper as defined by the ancient geographers, and was historically inhabited predominantly by Illyrian tribes, the name reflects the fact that under Roman rule, the area had been subject to increasing Hellenization and settlement by Epirote tribes from the south. The rest of Epirus now became Old Epirus (, or ).
Late Antiquity.
The two Epirote provinces became part of the Diocese of Moesia, until it was divided in ca. 369 into the dioceses of Macedonia and Dacia, when they became part of the former. In the 4th century, Epirus was still a stronghold of paganism, and was aided by Emperor Julian (r. 361–363) and his praetorian prefect Claudius Mamertinus through reduction in taxes and the rebuilding of the provincial capital, Nicopolis. According to Jordanes, the Visigoths raided the area in 380. With the division of the Empire on the death of Theodosius I in 395, Epirus became part of the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire. In 395–397, the Visigoths under Alaric plundered Greece. They remained in Epirus for a few years, until 401, and again in 406–407, during Alaric's alliance with the Western Roman generalissimo Stilicho in order to wrest Eastern Illyricum from the Eastern Empire.
From 467 on, the Ionian Islands and the coasts of Epirus became subject to raids by the Vandals, who had taken over the North African provinces and established their own kingdom, the Kingdom of the Vandals, centred on Carthage. The Vandals seized Nicopolis in 474 as a bargaining chip in their negotiations with Emperor Zeno, and plundered Zakynthos, killing many of its inhabitants and capturing many others and taking them into slavery. Epirus Nova became a battleground during the power struggles of the Ostrogoths after 479, in which the Byzantines were involved. A Gothic attempt to take Durrës was repulsed by Roman forces during this period. 
In 517, a raid of the Getae or Antae reached Greece, including Epirus Vetus. Procopius of Caesarea claims in his "Secret History" that under Justinian I (r. 527–565), the entirety of the Balkan provinces was raided by barbarians every year. However, this is considered rhetorical hyperbole by modern scholars, as only a single Slavic raid to the environs of Dyrrhachium, in 548/9, has been documented. Procopius further reports that in 551, the Ostrogothic king Totila sent his fleet to raid the shores of Epirus, in an attempt to interdict the Byzantines' lines of communication with Italy during the Gothic War, in which the Byzantines were trying to annex his kingdom. In response to these raids, and to repair the damage done by two destructive earthquakes in 522, Justinian initiated a wide-ranging programme of reconstruction and re-fortification: Hadrianopolis was rebuilt, albeit in reduced extent, and renamed Justinianopolis, while Euroea was moved further inland - this has been traditionally identified with the founding of Ioannina. Procopius also claims that no less than 36 smaller fortresses in Epirus Vetus — most of them not identifiable today — were either rebuilt or built anew.
Loss and Byzantine reconquest.
In the late 6th century, much of Greece, including Epirus, fell under the control of the Avars and their Slavic allies. This is placed by the "Chronicle of Monemvasia" in the year 587, and is further corroborated by evidence that several sees were abandoned by their bishops by 591. Thus in the bishop, clergy and people of Euroea fled their city, carrying with them the relics of their patron saint, St. Donatus, to Cassiope in Corfu.
The restoration of Byzantine rule seems to have proceeded from the islands, chiefly Cephallonia, which was certainly under firm Imperial control in , when Philippicus Bardanes was banished there. The gradual restoration of Imperial rule is evidenced further from the participation of local bishops in councils in Constantinople: whereas only the bishop of Dyrrhachium participated in the Ecumenical Councils of 680/1 and 692, a century later the bishops of Dyrrhachium, Nicopolis, Corfu, Cephallonia, and Zakynthos are attested in the Second Council of Nicaea in 787. 
In about the middle of the 8th century, the Theme of Cephallenia was established; this, along with the Theme of Nicopolis, which was established in the 9th century, covered the former region of Epirus Vetus. The Theme of Dyrrhachium, established in the 9th century, covered what was once Epirus Nova, and Byzantine rule in Epirus in the early Middle Ages would continue through these new provinces.
Economy.
The province, especially the northern towns, benefitted greatly from the construction of the Via Egnatia to the north. Due to both its traditionally reputed livestock and its proximity to the Italian peninsula, Epirus became a major exporter of cattle and luxury goods like racehorses to Italy, where the latter were in great demand for the popular chariot races in Rome.
Epirus also had significant populations of Italian settlers with large estates, attracted by the potential for pastoral agriculture. It is possible that these settlers had significant impact on the demographics and commerce of the province.
Cities and settlements.
The "Synecdemus" of Hierocles, composed in ca. 527/8 AD but probably reflecting the situation in the first half of the 5th century, reports eleven cities for Old Epirus: 
New Epirus, with its capital at Dyrrhachium, comprised nine cities.

Kulumuli

Kulumuli, also known by the name Twenkë, is a Wayana village situated on an island in the Lawa River in French Guiana. Kulumuli is the residence of the granman of the Wayana in French Guiana.
Name.
The indigenous name for the village is Kulumuli, which means reed. The alternative name Twenkë refers to the late chief of the village, who was installed as granman of the Wayana in French Guiana by the French authorities.
History.
Halfway through the twentieth century, Surinamese and French authorities tried to gain a firmer grip on the interior of Suriname and French Guiana, respectively. The indigenous inhabitants of the interior were registered in the civil registry of both colonies, and the Wayana, as inhabitants of the border between Suriname and French Guiana, were given the choice to register as either a Dutch or as a French subject. Twenkë chose the French side and founded a village on the right riverbank of the Lawa River. Twenkë was recognised by the French as the granman of the Lawa River. After his death, he was succeeded by his son Amaipotï.
In 1973, the Alsatian Jean-Paul Klingelhofer was sent by the French authorities to Kulumuli to establish a school and to work as a teacher. His wife Françoise would later start a nursery in the village.
Geography.
Kulumuli lies opposite the villages of Taluwen on the French east river bank and Pïleike on the Surinamese west river bank. Taluwen itself is conjoined with the village of Epoja. Pïleike was the village of shaman Pïleike. When he passed away in the late 1990s, he ordered his fellow villagers to cross the river and join Kulumuli.
Kulimuli lies about downstream the Lawa River from the village of Antecume Pata and upstream the Lawa River from the village of Kawemhakan in Suriname.

The Greatest Living Englishman

The Greatest Living Englishman is an album by English musician Martin Newell, released in November 1993. It was produced, engineered, and mastered by XTC's Andy Partridge, and recorded in his shed on a budget less than £12,000. The album was well-received by critics and ultimately became the most acclaimed of Newell's career.
Background.
Partridge was contacted to produce the album after his band XTC had gone on strike against their label Virgin Records. Newell submitted 20 of what he considered his best songs to Partridge, but most were rejected. Partridge thought "Martin was a bit shocked at me telling him this. But I started the way I intended to go on which was to be honest with him. ... He wrote some great stuff after that." The available budget for the album was less than £12,000. Normally, his rate was £3000 per song as a producer, but he agreed to take on the project anyway, provided that he receive the entirety of the budget "and handle everything - production, engineering, mastering."
Recording.
Sessions lasted from January to August 1993 at Partridge's home studio shed in Swindon. The album was recorded using an eight-track ADAT and a Macintosh computer. Both musicians recalled that the album's making was not particularly difficult. Martin remembered: "He [Andy] has the hearing of a bat. Things I would've just left, he had me go back and do seven, eight, nine times. He was exacting, but he wasn't cruel. He was fabulous to work with." Partridge similarly described the sessions as "funny and intense. A lot of laughs were had." On the album's songs, Newell denied that he was significantly influenced by the Kinks, and "although I was pretty familiar with the Beach Boys, at the time we were making the record, I'd never heard "Pet Sounds". Andy was incredulous when I told him and he immediately made me a cassette copy of it." However, by that time, the album's songs were already composed. XTC member Dave Gregory made frequent visits to the studio and was credited on the sleeve as "Pop Mastermind". Partridge played most of the album's drum tracks with a Yamaha drum pad, since the shed studio was too small to reasonably hold a real full-sized drum kit.
The album's title was originally planned to be "Great New Product" and credited to "Martin Newell featuring the New &amp; Improved Andy Partridge". Humbug label owner Kevin Crace explained that "by the time we'd finished, it had become obvious that Andy had done so much on this album that he should have some other credit besides 'producer'". It was decided that the album should actually be called "The Greatest Living Englishman", but on initial pressings, the credit to a "new and improved" Andy Partridge was retained. He said: "we were going to make it like a soap packet ... [I was credited] like an ingredient. And then suddenly, without me knowing it, the album title changed but for some reason they kept that credit. It made sense when the whole concept was like a soap packet, but then the title changed and it all went out the window."
Release.
"The Greatest Living Englishman" was warmly received in the US and was met with critical acclaim in France. It also sold well in Germany and Japan. Newell played a small tour in the last three counties with a band that included Dave Gregory, Captain Sensible, the Brotherhood of Lizard's Peter Nice, and the Damned's Garrie Dreadful. In later years, the album went on to become the most acclaimed of Newell's career. He responded that the work was "not necessarily my best album but it's got some good kit on it." Partridge expressed that the "songs are excellent. I'm proud of it. I just wish that I had all the tracks and the obscure equipment it was recorded on and I could remix it. ... It is lo-fi, but dammit, it is lo-fi glorious."

Winthrop Astor Chanler

Winthrop Astor Chanler (October 14, 1863 – August 24, 1926) was an American sportsman and soldier who fought in the Spanish–American War and World War I.
Chanler, a descendant of many prominent American families including the Dudley–Winthrop, Livingston, and Stuyvesant families, and his wife were also prominent in New York society during the Gilded Age.
Early life.
Chanler, who was known as "Wintie" was born on October 14, 1863 in New York City. He was the second son of eleven children born to Margaret Astor (née Ward) Chanler (1838–1875) and John Winthrop Chanler (1826–1877), a U.S. Representative from New York.
He and his siblings became orphans after the death of their mother in December 1875 and their father in October 1877, both to pneumonia. The children, known as the "Astor Orphans", were raised at their parents' estate in Rokeby, New York, built by John Armstrong Jr., his mother's great-grandfather. His father's estate was valued between $1,500,000 (equivalent to $) and $2,000,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars). John Winthrop Chanler's will provided $20,000 a year for each child for life (equivalent to $470,563 in 2018 dollars), enough to live comfortably by the standards of the time. Winthrop himself inherited all of his father's personal property in his New York City home, located at 192 Madison Avenue, all of his real estate in Delaware County, and a house on Cliff Lawn in Newport.
Chanler prepared for University at Eton College and at St. John's Military Academy in Sing Sing, New York. In 1885 Winthrop graduated from Harvard College, which his brother William also attended from 1886 to 1888. While at Harvard, Winthrop was part of a prank played on Oscar Wilde when he appeared before the College to give a speech at the Boston Music Hall in 1882. Chanler, along with 60 other Harvard students, "marched down the center aisle in pairs, all carrying sunflowers and wearing Wildean costumes of knee breeches, black stockings, wide-spreading cravats, and shoulder length wigs." His great-aunt Julia Ward Howe, who considered Winthrop her favorite, was in the audience and was apparently aghast at the prank.
Family.
Through his mother, he was related to the Ward and Astor families, and through his father, he was related to the Dudley–Winthrop, Livingston, and Stuyvesant families. Of his ten brothers and sisters, many were prominent including John Armstrong Chaloner, a writer; Robert Winthrop Chanler, an artist; and William Astor Chanler, a noted soldier and explorer who served in the U.S. House of Representatives like their father, Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler, the Lt. Gov. of New York. His sister Margaret Livingston Chanler was married to critic Richard Aldrich and served as a nurse with the American Red Cross during the Spanish–American War, and sister Elizabeth Astor Winthrop Chanler was married to author John Jay Chapman.
Career.
After his marriage, the Chanlers moved to Washington, D.C. where the surrounded themselves with a group of friends including Theodore Roosevelt, who was then the Civil Service Commissioner, and later President of the United States.
Military service.
During the Spanish–American War, Chanler did not enlist in the regular U.S. Army but instead formed his own small military unit that became known as "Chanler's Rough Riders". In a confusing twist, his younger brother, William, joined "Roosevelt's Rough Riders," known officially as the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry, or simply as the "Rough Riders". "Chanler's Rough Riders" saw service with the Cuban volunteers under General Emilio Núñez. with Chanler receiving a conditional commission as Lieutenant colonel under the Cuban government. Chanler and his men took part in the June 30, 1898 Battle of Tayacoba In the action Chanler, William Louis Abbott (also of "Chanler's Rough Riders"), Captain Jose Manuel Núñez (brother of General Núñez), and about two dozen men went ashore near Trinidad, Cuba to ensure the safety of the landing site. They were discovered by Spanish scouts and came under heavy fire. During the battle, Captain Núñez was killed and Chanler was shot through the right elbow. They had to take cover in a mangrove swamp until they could be rescued by a volunteer rescue party from the American steamship "Florida". Chanler returned to his home in Barrytown to recover from his injuries. By the time his arm healed, the war was over, so Chanler sailed to Europe where he stayed for several years in Sorrento, Italy.
During World War I, he served as an aide to General John J. Pershing, who served as the commander of the American Expeditionary Force on the Western Front from 1917 to 1918.
Society life.
 Due to his elder brother's mental issues, Winthrop became the de facto head of the Chanler family. The Chanler's spent the winter of 1891 to 1892 in New York where three of his sisters were introduced to society. Thereafter, they moved to Tuxedo Park, New York which according to his wife, "seemed dull in its exclusiveness; the tendency of Anglo-Saxons to separate into 'social sets and hierarchies' was in striking contrast to the hospitality and cosmopolitanism of Roman society" where she had grown up. In the late 1890s, they lived in Newport, Rhode Island where Chanler paid taxes on an estate valued at $96,300 in 1895.
In 1892, both Chanler and his wife Margaret were included in Ward McAllister's "Four Hundred", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in "The New York Times". Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. His wife described the list of New York's elite as "not unlike Dante's description of Paradise." 
Chanler, a member of the Society of Patriarchs, attended the Patriarch's Ball organized by McAllister for his fellow "American aristocrats" at Delmonico's in December 1892.
In 1903, Chanler moved from Newport to Geneseo, New York in Livingston County. While in Genseo, he served as master of the hounds of the Genesee Valley Hunt Club. He reportedly spent most of his time fox hunting and horse breeding at his estate, Sweet Briar Farms, which was once owned by the Wadsworth family. In 1913, his wife, who was Catholic, built the Chapel of St. Felicity at the Farm.
Personal life.
On December 16, 1886, Chanler was married to Margaret Louisa Terry (1862–1952), a first cousin, once removed, in Rome, Italy. Margaret's grandparents (Julia Rush Cutler and Samuel Ward Jr) were also Chanler's maternal great grandparents. Margaret, who grew up in the Palazzo Odescalchi in Rome, was the daughter of Louisa (née Ward) Crawford Terry and artist Luther Terry (d. 1900), a half-sister of F. Marion Crawford and a niece of Julia Ward Howe. Together, they were the parents of:
On August 5, 1926, Chanler suffered a stroke following a fall from his horse. He died at Brigham Hall in Canandaigua, New York on August 24, 1926. He was buried at St. Mary's Catholic Cemetery in Geneseo, New York. After his death, his widow wrote several novels and a memoir entitled "Roman Spring", published in 1934. A second memoir, entitled "Autumn in the Valley" was published by Little, Brown and Company, 1936.
Descendants.
Through his son Hubert, he was the grandfather of Susanne Felicity Chanler, who married Stephen Young; Gay Chanler, who married John Andrew Gunther; and Elizabeth Chanler, who married Bruce Chatwin (1940–1989), the English writer, novelist, and journalist.

The protesters also responded to controversial cabinet appointments by the Trump administration, citing that positions requiring advanced scientific knowledge are being filled by appointees without proper experience in their field.
The 2018 March for Science organizers wrote a statement about themselves and what they stand for, reading, " We are people who value science and recognize how science serves. We come from all races, all religions, all gender identities, all sexual orientations, all abilities, all socioeconomic backgrounds, all political perspectives, and all nationalities. Our diversity is our greatest strength: a wealth of opinions, perspectives, and ideas is critical for the scientific process. What unites us is a love of science, and an insatiable curiosity. We all recognize that science is everywhere and affects everyone."

Georges Lacour-Gayet

Georges Lacour-Gayet (31 May 1856 – 8 December 1935) was a French historian who taught at the École Navale and the École Polytechnique.
His books on the French navy under Louis XV and Louis XVI are much-quoted and were considered references when published, although they betray his patriotic bias.
His master work was a four-volume biography of Talleyrand.
Life.
Georges Lacour-Gayet was born in Marseille on 30 May 1856.
He attended the École normale supérieure at rue d'Ulm, Paris.
His schoolmates included the future geographers Bertrand Auerbach, Marcel Dubois and Paul Dupuy, and the future historians Salomon Reinach and Gustave Lanson.
He became a historian.
On 2 October 1882 he married Cécile Janet (1856–1926), daughter of the philosopher Paul Janet (1823–1899).
Their children were Jacques() (1883–1953), Thérèse (1890–1936) and Robert (1896–1989).
Lacour-Gayet was professor at the École Navale during the period of the Fashoda Incident and the Entente Cordiale.
For many years his "La marine militaire de la France sous le règne de Louis XV" (Paris, Champion, 1902, 571 pages) was considered the reference work for this subject.
He gave a course of lectures at the Ecole Superieure de Marine that formed the bases for his 1905 "La marine militaire de France sous le règne de Louis XVI".
He was also a professor at the École Polytechnique in Paris.
He was a member of the Institut Français, Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques and the Académie de Marine.
He was a member of the Société de l'histoire de France from 1924, and became a member of the society's council that year.
Lacour-Gayet later had another child, a future historian and journalist Georgette Elgey, from his relationship with Madeleine Léon, who belonged to the Jewish upper-class but later converted to Catholicism; she was the great-granddaughter of Michel Lévy, France's first Jewish general. After he refused to marry her, Léon fought for years for Elgey to be officially recognised as his daughter, eventually losing in court but leaving his reputation in shatters. He died in Paris on 8 December 1935 at the age of 79.
Views.
Lacour-Gayet described the colonial competition between France and Britain in the century before 1815 as the "Second Hundred Years War".
He claimed that the efforts of the Académie de Marine prepared the French navy for its "victories in the American War".
This view was not shared by Raoul Castex, who connected the personnel and work of the Academy to the naval defeats of the Seven Years' War (1756–63).
Lacour-Gayet considered that "Suffren, among the grand sailors, is the perfect model."
He had "the spirit of initiative ... the premier quality of a commander, the most necessary, the most truly characteristic, because it is for this that he is chief."
Writing of the year 1758 Lacour-Gayet wrote in "La marine militaire de France sous le règne de Louis XVI " (1905), "To the repeated descents of the English on coasts of the Saintonge, the Contentin, and Brittany, had been added the loss of Louisbourg, which portended that of Montreal. ... The course of events led one to the idea of a landing in the British islands; because it was the true means to revenge ourselves with a single stroke, and to finish the war."
Lacour-Gayet was hard on failure.
Charles François Emmanuel Nadeau du Treil(), the governor of Guadeloupe, was degraded and condemned to life imprisonment after he lost the island in 1759.
Lacour-Gayet said he deserved the punishment.
Lacour-Gayet's 1905 book on the navy under Louis XVI was written at a time when the loss at Fashoda was still remembered with bitterness and many in France were hostile to England.
He saw the failure of France to invade Britain when they had the chance in 1779 as a great lost opportunity.
The French fleet dominated the English channel and the French army of invasion was ready to embark in transports. He wrote, "Never at any time in history, not even when Napoleon's army lay encamped at Boulogne, was the French navy to near its oft-dreamt-of goal, the invasion of England."
In 1918 Nicolae Petrescu-Comnen contributed an ethnographic overview of Dobruja ("La Dobrogea"), just as the region was being absorbed into a Greater Bulgaria. Lacour-Gayet presented the work at the Romanian Academy and said the "savant work" of "truth and justice", had exposed the practices of Bulgarisation.
Lacour-Gayet's biography of Talleyrand (4 volumes, 1928–1934) was exhaustively documented.
He studied all of Talleyrand's writings.
He concluded that "the mechanism of the constitution, which had been functioning only a few years, the role of the President, the programs of different parties did not seem to have fixed his attention."
He noted that Talleyrand's observations focused primarily on economics rather than politics, so he could not be called a direct predecessor of Alexis de Tocqueville.
Publications.

Paddleton

Paddleton is a 2019 American comedy-drama film, directed by Alex Lehmann, from a script by Lehmann and Mark Duplass. The film stars Duplass and Ray Romano.
The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on February 1, 2019. It was released on February 22, 2019, by Netflix to generally favorable reviews from critics.
Plot.
Middle-aged Michael is diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer and decides to end his life. This upsets his upstairs neighbor Andy, as they are each other's best (and only) friends and help each other escape from their menial jobs. 
Andy encourages Michael to fight the cancer, but Michael refuses to prolong any suffering. As per Michael's wishes, they make pizzas together, watch kung fu movies, solve jigsaw puzzles, and play Paddleton, a game of their own creation. Andy promises to finally tell Michael a rousing halftime speech that he has been working on in secret.
Andy is reluctant to help Michael end his own life, but agrees to join him on a road trip to the closest pharmacy that will fill the prescription, six hours away. During their drive, they discuss genie-in-a-bottle style wishes and stop to visit an ostrich farm on the way. They pick up Michael's prescription and check into a hotel, where they are mistaken for a gay couple. While Michael naps, Andy buys a mini safe where he puts the medication and withholds the combination. 
They go to an open mic night, where a nervous Andy finally delivers his halftime speech to himself in the bathroom mirror before helping Michael perform a scene from their favorite kung fu movie onstage. They later break hotel rules, using a Jacuzzi after-hours while drinking. Caught by the hotel owner, she ends up joining them and flirting with Andy, leading Michael to go back to their room. Andy is uncomfortable as she mentions her deceased husband being "all around her."
Andy wakes up the next morning to find Michael and the safe missing. He panics, running all over, the looking for Michael, only to discover him in the hotel lobby, waiting to meet up for breakfast. Andy takes and attempts to keep hold of the safe, until an annoyed Michael forces him to face the fact that he is dying, and that Andy needs to respect his wishes. 
They drive back home, where his condition quickly deteriorates. As they sit on the kitchen floor preparing the lethal dose of medicine, Michael reveals that he used to be married, but quickly felt uncomfortable within the marriage. In contrast, he felt an instant sense of belonging with Andy when they met. Andy replies that when he first saw Michael, he thought he was a serial killer in hiding. They discuss Andy's halftime speech (which Michael has already heard through the apartment's vents) and the possibility of an afterlife where Michael could visit Andy.
Ready to die, they deliver the lethal dose of medication. After a brief moment of fear, Michael dies peacefully in his own bed after they reaffirm their platonic love for each other, leaving Andy devastated. Andy tries to live his usual life of kung fu movies, puzzles, and Paddleton, but is lonely and unfulfilled. Some time later, Andy meets the single mother named Kiersten and her son Evan moving into Michael's old apartment. He reassures them that they have the best apartment in the complex and explains the game of Paddleton to Evan. Promising to give him a rousing halftime speech if he ever needs it, Andy returns to his own apartment with a smile.
Production.
In February 2018, it was announced Alex Lehmann had directed a film, from a screenplay written by him and Mark Duplass. It stars Duplass and Ray Romano. Duplass and Jay Duplass are credited as executive producers under their Duplass Brothers Productions banner, while Mel Eslyn, Alana Carithers and Sean Bradley are credited as producers.
The script and resulting film were based on the lives of Rob Mermin and Bill Morancy. Their story was originally produced as a podcast episode in 2016 by Rumblestrip Vermont entitled "Last Chapter".
Release.
It had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on February 1, 2019. It was released on February 22, 2019.
Critical response.
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89%, with an average rating of 7.24/10 based on 37 reviews. Its critical consensus reads, "It takes its time coming together, but the quietly effective Paddleton pulls off a tricky tonal balancing act, thanks largely to the strengths of its well-chosen leads." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 70 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews."
Writing for RogerEbert.com, Monica Castillo gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, stating: ""Paddleton" is an appreciation of friendship for better or for worse, in sickness and in health. It’s about the way your best friend notices things about you that you may not know about yourself."

Athletics at the 2018 Commonwealth Games

Athletics was one of ten core sports that appeared at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast. As a founding sport, athletics has appeared consistently since its introduction at the 1911 Inter-Empire Games; the recognized precursor to the Commonwealth Games. The competition took place between Sunday 8–15 April 2018 at the Carrara Stadium.
The programme featured an expanded event set for para-athletes with a total of six men's and six women's events, re presenting doubling of the number para-events at the previous games. This move was approved of by the para-athletes, and Kailyn Joseph noted that inclusion in the medal table alongside able-bodied events allowed her to share in the same environment, as opposed to the separation found in the Paralympics and World Para Athletics Championships.
Two Indian athletes, racewalker Irfan Kolothum Thodi and triple jumper A.V. Rakesh Babu were removed from the games after a needle was found in their apartment, breaking games policy. A Singapore para-athlete, Mohammad Khairi Ishak, was withdrawn from the men's T47 100 m after failing a drug test prior to the competition. Other controversies of the athletics included the gold medal disqualification of Zharnel Hughes in the men's 200 m, after he impeded (eventual gold medallist) Jereem Richards, and the mid-race collapse of men's marathon leader Callum Hawkins.
Preparation.
In preparation for hosting the Commonwealth Games Athletics events, the modified Carrara Stadium was used for the Australian Athletics Championships in February 2018.
The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority conducted a series of anti-doping tests in the months before the games. Australian sprinter Jessica Peris (daughter of former Commonwealth Games sprint champion Nova Peris) was among those to a fail doping test and she withdrew from the Australian trials event.
Schedule.
Over the 10 days of competition there were 58 medal events including additional para-sport disciplines.

Takako Tobise

Takako Tobise (born 2 June 1974) is a Japanese female former long-distance runner who specialised in marathon running.
She had a very short-lived career. At the start of 1997 she set a personal best of 1:09:22 hours for half marathon in Tokyo before claiming the 10,000 metres title at the All Japan Corporate Track and Field Championships. At the Nagoya Women's Marathon, a third place finish in 2:29:37 hours earned her an international call-up for Japan at the 1997 World Championships in Athletics. At the competition in Tokyo the 23-year-old managed to finish fourth on her international debut with a run of 2:32:18 hours. Combined with the performances of winner Hiromi Suzuki and tenth-placer Nobuko Fujimura, this performance helped the Japanese women to the title at the 1997 World Marathon Cup.
Following her global performance she returned to the Nagoya Marathon in 1998, but her time of 2:35:26 hours left her out of contention and she did not compete internationally thereafter.

What Have They Done to My Song Ma

"What Have They Done to My Song Ma" is a song by Melanie. It was released in 1970 as the B-side of her "Ruby Tuesday" single and included on the album "Candles in the Rain". The single reached the number 39 in the United Kingdom and peaked within the top 20 in Norway and the Wallonia region of Belgium.
Other artists have recorded it as "Look What They've Done to My Song Ma", after the song's first line, and this title is used on the Music page at Melanie's own website.
Cover versions.
Daliah Lavi recorded a successful German version of the song in 1971 and Ray Charles released a cover (as "Look What They've Done to My Song, Ma") in 1972. It has also been tackled by many other artists, including Nina Simone, the New Seekers, and Billie Jo Spears. The New Seekers' version topped the New Zealand Singles Chart and reached the top 10 in Australia, Canada, and on the US "Billboard" Easy Listening chart.
Dalida recorded the song in French and Italian and released both as singles. Czechoslovak singer Helena Vondráčková did a rendition in 1971 as "Kam zmizel ten starý song" with Czech lyrics by Zdeněk Borovec. Jeanette did an English/French version in 1973. Yugoslav rock band Bajaga i Instruktori released a cover of it with lyrics in Serbian, called "Vidi šta sam ti uradio od pesme, mama", in 1985.
It was used in the 1970s as a commercial for Lifebuoy soap ("Look what they've done to my Lifebuoy"), and in the 1980s as a commercial jingle for Ramada Inn (as "Look what they've done to Ramada") and for Oatmeal Crisp cereal (as "Look what they've done to my oatmeal"). In October 2012, Miley Cyrus released a video of her own acoustic version of the song as part of her Backyard Sessions series. In 2015, Melanie joined her to duet on the song in addition to "Peace Will Come (According to Plan)". Another take on the song was done by Jack Wild that appeared on his album "Everything's Coming Up Roses", released in 1971.

FS Class E.220

FS Class E.220 was a two-axle electric locomotive, powered by a third rail, built for operation on the Varese line of the Italian Rete Mediterranea (Mediterranean Network) and registered as RM 02. It was acquired by the Italian State Railways in 1918 and re-registered as 220.01. It remained a unique example.
Overview.
The locomotive was built by in 1912 for shunting, freight trains and passengers trains on the third-rail electrified railway line Milan - Varese - Porto Ceresio, operated by Società per le Strade Ferrate del Mediterraneo. The electrical equipment was supplied by General Electric. The total power output was 220 kW (1 hour) or 150 kW (continuous) and maximum speed was 50 km/h. The two traction motors were geared directly to the axles. It appears to have been "deported" by German troops fleeing in 1945 and abandoned in Austria where it was converted to power supply from accumulators. In 1961 it was in Linz awaiting scrapping.

 upset top-seeded New Mexico State in the final, 70–62, to capture their second PCAA/Big West title (and first since 1977).
The 49ers subsequently received an automatic bid to the 1993 NCAA Tournament. Regular-season champions, and tournament runners-up, New Mexico State received an at-large bid.
Format.
One minor change was made to the tournament format this season despite the Big West maintaining its eight-team tournament.
All eight participating teams (the two teams with the worst conference regular season records were not included) were placed into the first round, with teams seeded and paired based on regular-season records. After the first round, however, teams were now "re-seeded" so the highest-remaining team was paired with the lowest-remaining time in one semifinal with the other two teams slotted into the other semifinal.
Nevada, in their first year as Big West members (moving from the Big Sky), failed to qualify for the tournament. The Wolf Pack replaced outgoing Fresno State, who left to join the WAC.

The ship was named in honor of Lance Corporal Miguel Keith, United States Marine Corps, by United States Secretary of the Navy Richard V. Spencer at the 242rd United States Marine Corps Birthday Ball held in National Harbor, Maryland, on November 5, 2017. The ship's namesake received the Medal of Honor posthumously for combat action in Quang Ngai Province during the Vietnam War in 1970. "Miguel Keith" was the first naval vessel named by Secretary Spencer. "Miguel Keith" was originally a non-commissioned ship, with a USNS prefix but, like her sister ships, she was commissioned by the Navy, in order to provide combatant commanders greater operational flexibility in utilizing the ESBs in accordance with the laws of armed conflict.
"Miguel Keith" had her keel laid on 30 January 2018 and delivered to U.S. Navy on 15 November 2019. On 8 May 2021, "Miguel Keith" commissioned into Navy service at Naval Air Station North Island.
The ship was damaged while under construction when the General Dynamics National Steel and Shipbuilding Company drydock was accidentally flooded on 11 July 2018.

Nariman Marshall

Nariman Darabsha Marshall (3 January 1905 – 29 August 1979) was an Indian cricketer who played first-class cricket from 1928 to 1938.
Nariman Marshall was a lower middle-order batsman and occasional opener, as well as occasional slow-medium bowler and wicket-keeper. After doing well in the trial matches in 1931-32 he was selected to tour England with India's first Test touring team in 1932. However, he was unable to make the most of his infrequent opportunities on tour and did not play in the Test match. The highlight of his tour was an unbeaten 102 batting at number nine to save the match against Warwickshire, when he added 217 for the eighth wicket in 140 minutes with C. K. Nayudu.
His highest first-class score was 120 in one of the trial matches in 1931-32. A month earlier he had taken his best bowling figures of 3 for 17 to help Freelooters win the Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup Tournament. 
He umpired several Ranji Trophy matches between 1937 and 1940, including two in the 1937-38 competition, when he later played for Nawanagar in the final. In the 1960s he coached the Royal Cricket Club in Jaipur.

Iris Biba

Iris Biba-Pöschl (born 27 May 1964) is a German female former long-distance runner competed over distances from 3000 metres to the marathon. She won the 1989 Frankfurt Marathon and represented her country at the World Championships in Athletics in 1991 and 1997, finishing in the top ten each time. She also competed at the IAAF World Women's Road Race Championships (twice), IAAF World Cross Country Championships and the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships. She was banned for doping in 1993.
Career.
Born in Freigericht in central Germany, she competed for West Germany and made her first major appearances at the 1986 European Athletics Championships, where she was a 3000 m finalist, and at the 1986 IAAF World Women's Road Race Championships. She won four West German national titles: twice in cross country running (1987, 1989), and a distance double of 10,000 metres/15K in 1989. Her last major appearance for West Germany was at the 1987 IAAF World Cross Country Championships.
On her debut at the marathon distance she won the 1989 Frankfurt Marathon title in a time of 2:33:14 hours. She improved to 2:30:21 hours at the Rotterdam Marathon the following year, coming in second place. She was chosen to represent Germany in the event at the 1991 World Championships in Athletics and she managed ninth place overall. Over 15 km at the World Women's Road Race Championships, she shared in the team title alongside Uta Pippig and Kerstin Pressler.
In 1993, an out-of-competition doping test revealed traces of anabolic steroids in her system and she received a three-year ban for the infraction. Biba still denies having ever knowingly used banned substances.
Upon her return to competition she won the 1996 Frankfurt Half Marathon then ran 2:32:15 hours for third at the Rome City Marathon. This was enough for Olympic selection, but an injury forced her to withdraw. A lifetime best of 2:29:08 hours came at the Berlin Marathon that year, where she was sixth. This assured her place for the 1997 World Championships in Athletics and she had a sixth place finish there. After an appearance at the 1997 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships, she ran two marathons in 1998: third in Hannover, fourth in Berlin. In 1999 she won the Würzburger Residenzlauf, then failed to finish the distance at the Hannover Marathon, but took second at the Cologne Marathon in October.
An injury curtailed her career at the turn of the decade and she retired from the professional after being attacked by a German Shepherd dog in 2004.

The Masters Apprentices (1967 album)

The Masters Apprentices is the self titled debut studio album by the Masters Apprentices, released in June 1967 on Astor Records. It featured two hit singles; "Undecided" and "Buried and Dead", both of which has been released on the "The Masters Apprentices" EP in February 1967.
Background.
In mid-1966 Adelaide-based rock group, the Masters Apprentices, shared a gig with pop star, Bobby Bright (of Melbourne duo, Bobby &amp; Laurie), who was impressed and recommended them to his label, Astor Records. A few weeks later, they were contacted by Astor's Max Pepper, who requested a four-track demo. The band went to Pepper's local two-track studio to record it, : "Hot Gully Wind", "Buried and Dead", "She's My Girl" and "Undecided". The demo became their debut extended play, "The Masters Apprentices" (February 1967).
"Undecided" was released as the group's debut single, "Undecided" backed by "Wars or Hands of Time", was released in October 1966 and gradually climbed the Adelaide charts, due to support from local DJs, peaking at No. 4. The B-side, "Wars or Hands of Time", written solely by Bower, is the first Australian pop song to directly address the issue of the Vietnam War, which was then affecting the lives of many young Australians because of the controversial introduction of conscription in 1965. Teen pop newspaper, "Go-Set", started publishing their national singles charts in October 1966. By February of the following year the group had relocated to Melbourne and issued their four-track EP (which was self-titled) on Astor. "Undecided" peaked at No. 13 on the "Go-Set" National Top 40 in June 1967, spending sixteen weeks in the charts.
Due to the success of "Undecided" and the EP, Astor requested additional tracks to be recorded for a full length album. The album itself is a compilation of the four tracks featured on the EP, five cover songs ("Dancing Girl", "I Feel Fine", "My Girl", "Don't Fight It" and "Johnny B Goode") and two new originals ("But One Day" and "Theme For A Social Climber") written by then chief songwriter and guitarist Mick Bower.
The album was released by Astor Records in June, 1967. It was later reissued on the budget Summit Records label in 1971. In 2009 a 2 CD special edition was released by reissue label Aztec Music.
Reception.
In a retrospective review Allmusic was mixed on the album saying that the "Debut mixes sloppy covers of popular '60s rock and soul tunes with some fine originals".

Galaxy On Fire 2

Galaxy On Fire 2 is a spaceflight simulation video game created and distributed by Fishlabs in 2009.
Overview.
The game revolves around spaceflight and space combat, set in a universe with multiple star systems. Players can fight enemies/friends, mine for ore, trade commodities, and complete jobs such as freelance missions.
Plot.
The game follows the adventures of Keith T. Maxwell, as he is sent forwards in time after a malfunction with his hyperdrive, caused by damage from a skirmish in an asteroid belt. His craft, hurtling out of control with Keith unconscious, is put in an orbit around Var Hastra by the onboard flight computer, before being salvaged by an ore dealer and towed to the orbiting space station. The dealer, Gunant Breh, tells Keith of events that happened while Keith was unconscious. Breh then tasks Keith with collecting ore from an old mining ship. While mining, the ship comes under attack by pirates, and Keith flies back to the station. Unhappy with having to run away from the pirates, Keith convinces Gunant to help him take out the pirates in the area. After fighting off the pirates, Keith is told to visit a neighbouring planet, as the space station there recently lost contact. While investigating, Keith comes across his old friend Mkkt Bkkt, who explains that the crew of the station have been infected with 'neuro-algae', and are subsequently intoxicated.
After being given control of completing side quests, Keith is informed of a Terran convoy in the system, and that he could be picked up and sent back to Terran space. Upon arrival, the convoy is under attack by pirates. One of the gunners of the main vessel mistakes Keith's ship as another pirate, and disables it with an EMP blast. Keith is then transported aboard the ship as a prisoner. After arriving at Alioth station, Keith meets commander Brent Snocom. While they are talking, the conversation is suddenly interrupted by a Void attack outside the station. Keith, along with other pilots, are sent to defend the station. The Void fighters destroy a group of freighters, before escaping through a wormhole back into their territory. Back at the station, Snocom explains to Keith about the Voids.
Keith is told to meet a scientist,a certain Lieutenant Thomas Boyle who can provide more information on the Voids, but Boyle is held hostage by pirates. Keith then rescues Boyle and defeats the pirates, before taking him to a secret research facility at Thynome. From there, Keith meets Dr Carla Paolini, a scientist, and is told to return samples of Void technology, by travelling to a raid on another convoy. The Voids escape, but not after Keith destroys one of their fighters. It is from here that Keith meets Khador, an advanced alien who is developing a 'Khador Drive', which can transport a vessel instantly to another part of the galaxy, eliminating the need of jump gates.
Khador sends Keith on a mission to mine Void crystals, accessing Void space through a wormhole. After collecting 50 crystals, Khador has enough to construct the Khador Drive, and gives it to Keith. As these events are going on, the Terran and Vossk Empire agree to develop a strategy for ending the Void threat. They use a converted Vossk freighter, packed with explosives, which is sent through a wormhole, to destroy the Void 'mothership'. Keith provides escort to the freighter as it comes under fire. The Voids manage to cripple the freighter, so the pilot on board has to manually guide the freighter into the mothership. The freighter collides with the vessel, killing the pilot on board. After escaping through another wormhole, Keith flies back to Thynome, and goes on a date with Carla.
DLCs.
Galaxy on Fire 2 included a few DLCs to add on to the experience. These DLCs include two new campaigns, and the player's own personal space station at the Shima system. The official names to these DLCs are "Valkyrie," "Supernova," and "Kaamo Club." 
Kaamo Club.
The Kaamo Club is the player's own personal space station where the player can store an unlimited number of ships, weapons, equipment, and commodities. When acquired, the Kaamo Club is usable when Keith leaves the tutorial section of the game at Var Hastra. It will be found in the Shima system, orbiting a lone planet called Kaamo. Officially, it is in Midorian space, which is why it has a Midorian jump gate. 
Inside the Kaamo Club, in the Space Lounge, there are six specialists. They can sell the player specialty weapons, ships, and mods to the player's space craft at a cost proportional to the ship cost. These services include upgrading overall armor, handling, cargo hold, and an additional equipment slot. The two other specialists will sell the player unique ships and weapons/equipment, which are sold for a given time and at a fixed cost.
HD and Full HD releases.
Galaxy On Fire 2 was re-released for newer devices as an HD version, which features more detail and better graphics. A 'Full HD' version was also released, specifically for the Apple Mac and Windows computers. However, some content was cut from this version, such as the Valkyrie and Supernova DLCs, and the systems Loma and Shima.
Reviews.
The game received a 6/10 review on GameSpot, and a 90% score on Metacritic

Serenity Knolls

Serenity Knolls is an album by guitarists Bill Brovold and Jamie Saft released on the RareNoise label in 2017.
Reception.
On All About Jazz, Dan Bilawsky called it"an album of front porch twang-and-strum, evoking peacefulness on the prairies and offering one American idyll after another" noting "Bill Brovold and Jamie Saft have managed to capture the heart, spirit, and sound of a country day in their duo explorations. Heartland, hearth, and home sweet home are well-represented on "Serenity Knolls"". Chronogram's James Keepnews wrote "Although Kingston-based Rasta polymath Jamie Saft is best known as an accomplished keyboardist and studio maven, his recorded work as a guitarist dates as far back as two decades ... His dobro and lap steel skills get a rare, ample, and ravishing workout on this new collaboration with his fellow local multi-instrumentalist, guitarist Bill Brovold. The album title references the rehab center where Jerry Garcia died, striking a fitting balance for these 12 often stark tone poems—some warm and serene, others as dark and searching as the emotions upon the loss of a loved one. Much of the darkness comes from Brovold's chimes-at-midnight, dirge-y chordal atmospheres enveloping Saft's adept, pealing slide chorales".

Rennia gens

The gens Rennia, occasionally written Renia, was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. No members of this gens obtained any of the higher offices of the Roman state, but the family is known from inscriptions, and coins issued by a certain Gaius Renius, depicting the head of Roma on the obverse, and on the reverse Juno Caprotina in a chariot pulled by two goats.
Origin.
The appearance of Juno Caprotina suggests that the Rennii may have originated at Lanuvium, where Juno was particularly revered. The etymology of the nomen "Rennius" is uncertain; Chase suggests a possible connection with the Latin "renes", kidneys.
Praenomina.
Like other families known chiefly from imperial times, the Rennii seem to have confined themselves to the most common praenomina, and particularly "Lucius", "Gaius", and "Marcus". The only other names found among the Rennii are "Publius", "Quintus", and "Decimus", of which only the last was relatively uncommon.
Branches and cognomina.
The Rennii do not appear to have been divided into distinct families, and all of their surnames appear to have been personal cognomina, many of them probably having been the original names of freedmen of the gens. Of those that were more typical of Roman surnames, "Aestivus" refers to the summer, and was probably given to someone born during that season. "Candidus" means gleaming white, and could refer to one's hair or clothing. "Crispinus", a diminutive of "Crispus", referred to someone with curly hair.
"Faustus", fortunate, and "Proculus" were old praenomina, which came to be used as surnames in the later Republic and imperial times. "Felix", happy, and "Firmus", strong, "Hilarus", cheerful, "Rufus", red, and "Venustus", charming or handsome, were all common names; "Laetus", glad, and "Orientis", eastern, were more distinctive. A number of other surnames borne by both the men and women of the Rennii were also old praenomina, or similar individualizing cognomina, including "Maxima", eldest, "Prima", first, "Secundus", second, and "Tertius", third.

Carbon Cemetery

Carbon Cemetery is a cemetery in the coal-mining ghost town of Carbon, Wyoming. It was one of the first formal burial grounds in Wyoming, and is one of the few remaining vestiges of the town. Starting about 1868 the dead were brought to the town to be buried. By the late 1880s coal mining dropped off and the railroad moved elsewhere, and the town began to die. Victims of mine explosions were buried in the cemetery in 1903 and 1908. Its last resident died in 1912. A few burials took place after the town was abandoned. 
The site occupies an exposed location about nine miles southwest of Medicine Bow, Wyoming. It is surrounded by joined wood and metal posts, with a graveled loop road through the site. There are 239 marked graves and 98 more unmarked graves. It is likely that undocumented graves are present. The graves include traditional headstones as well as rock cairns, typically marking undocumented burials. The graves of the formerly numerous Finnish townspeople are vertical metal bars with vertical metal plates at the top, with painted inscriptions. Most of the lettering is now gone.
The cemetery was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 7, 2011.

Bobby Berk

Bobby James Berk (born August 25, 1981) is an American interior designer, reality television personality and author. He stars in the Netflix series "Queer Eye" as the interior design expert.
Early life.
Berk was born in Houston, Texas to a young mother and then adopted by his maternal aunt and her husband, Connie and Jerry Berk. He currently has a good relationship with all three. He grew up in Mount Vernon, Missouri in the middle of Amish farm country. Berk cites that being gay in the Bible Belt and attending an Assemblies of God church throughout his childhood was difficult, and that he faced both internal and external homophobia growing up.
Berk left home at the age of fifteen. He landed in Springfield, Missouri and got a job at Applebee's, in Branson, sleeping in his car or staying with friends. He drove home for school as a sophomore and briefly enrolled himself at Kickapoo High School for junior year. He ended up working as a telemarketer for MCI Communications. It was through this job that he first met his biological father. Just before he turned eighteen, he moved to Denver, Colorado, where he got a gig at the Bombay Company.
Career.
Berk relocated to New York City in 2003 with just $100 in his pocket. He found employment at Restoration Hardware and Bed, Bath and Beyond before moving on to Portico, a high-end home furnishing company. With no high school diploma or formal training he worked his way up to creative director.
After Portico folded in 2006, Berk launched his online store, Bobby Berk Home, in 2006, opening his first store in SoHo, Manhattan a year later. Midtown Miami, Florida followed in 2010 as well as Midtown Atlanta, Georgia. He later launched Bobby Berk Interiors + Design, specializing in interior design services, whose headquarters is in Downtown Los Angeles. He has appeared on television networks such as HGTV, NBC, CBS, and Bravo.
He has been the design expert on the Netflix series "Queer Eye" since 2018. Berk appeared in Taylor Swift's "You Need to Calm Down" music video.
Berk currently has his own line of wallpaper, furniture, and art. He also runs a full service interior design business.
Personal life.
In July 2018, Berk and his husband, Dewey Do, a maxillofacial surgeon moved to Los Angeles, California after living in New York City for 15 years.
Berk endorsed Elizabeth Warren in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.
On June 23, 2020, Berk and "Queer Eye" co-star Jonathan Van Ness praised recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions which ruled that LGBT employment discrimination was a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. However, both of them still urged the United States Congress to pass the proposed Equality Act, which Berk claimed would amend the Civil Rights Act so it "would really extend healthcare and housing rights."

Karate (software)

Karate is an open-source general-purpose test-automation framework that can script calls to HTTP end-points and assert that the JSON or XML responses are as expected. Karate also has support for service-virtualization where it can bring up "mock" (or stub) servers which can substitute for web-services that need to participate in an integration-test. Karate's capabilities include being able to run tests in parallel, HTML reports and compatibility with Continuous Integration tools.
The additional capability to re-use functional tests as performance-tests via integration with the Gatling tool was released in July 2018 The project also added the capability to perform web-UI automation in 2019 which was declared out of RC (release-candidate) status in 2020.
Karate is implemented in Java but test-scripts are written in Gherkin since Karate was originally an extension of the Cucumber framework. It was built within Intuit and released under the MIT license.
History.
Karate was created by Peter Thomas, an Intuit employee.
Basic usage.
This example shows what a simple Karate test script looks like and how it is based on the Gherkin syntax.
Feature: karate 'hello world' example
Scenario: create and retrieve a cat
Given url 'http://myhost.com/v1/cats'
When method post
Then status 201
Given path response.id
When method get
Then status 200
This actually makes two calls, first an HTTP codice_1 to 'http://myhost.com/v1/cats' and then a codice_2 to the same URL but with the value of codice_3 appended as a REST-ful path parameter. The codice_4 keyword is used for asserting that a given payload is as expected. The use of the codice_5 "fuzzy match" token takes care of "ignoring" the actual value since it is dynamic, as it is a server-side auto-generated identifier.
Reception.
Karate was featured as one of the top 5 open-source API testing tools within six months of its release. It was also mentioned as one of the 10 API testing tools to try in 2017.
Karate was first listed in the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar in 2019 with a rating of "Assess". One year later it moved into the "Trial" category in May 2020.

Jeanette Scissum

Jeanette Alexandra Scissum is a mathematician, space scientist, and diversity advocate who put forward techniques for improved forecasting of the sunspot cycle.
Early life and education.
Scissum was born in Guntersville, Alabama, the second youngest in a family of six children. Her father, an Army veteran, was a sharecropper who went to work for Cargill Granary and was eventually paralyzed and disabled. Her mother was a domestic worker. She attended Lakeview School, the only school for black children in the area, and graduated in 1956, where she was a good student and basketball player. Scissum's father was convinced that she would attend college and repeatedly told her this from a very young age. Scissum was awarded a small scholarship to study at Alabama A&amp;M University which she supplemented by working at a telephone switchboard. She earned her bachelor's and master's degree in mathematics before returning to graduate school to get her PhD in computer science after 13 years at Marshall Space Flight Center.
Career.
Scissum started teaching at Councill Training School, Huntsville's only black high school. Here she very quickly realised that teaching was not for her as she worried about the students a lot. Scissum joined NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center as an entry level mathematician in 1964 after a recommendation from a friend and was the first African-American mathematician to be employed by Marshall. She published a NASA report in 1967, “Survey of Solar Cycle Prediction Models,” which put forward techniques for improved forecasting of the sunspot cycle. In the mid-1970s she worked as a space scientist in the Space Environment Branch of Marshall’s Space Sciences Laboratory and she led activities in Marshall’s Atmospheric, Magnetospheric, and Plasmas in Space project. Following the completion of her PhD, she later moved to Maryland to work in Goddard Space Flight Center as a computer systems analyst responsible for analyzing and directing NASA management information and technical support systems. She retired in 2005.
Scissum's accomplishments have earned her recognition by Mathematically Gifted &amp; Black as a Black History Month 2018 Honoree.
Diversity.
Scissum was passionate about inclusion and volunteered to be an equal employment opportunity officer. Her contributions in this role were recognised by an award from NASA Administrator James Fletcher, but she did note that fighting for others sometimes put her own career in jeopardy. She was warned by a top female supervisor that management were unhappy with the number of complaints that she was handling. In 1975, Scissum wrote an article for the National Technical Association, "Equal Employment Opportunity and the Supervisor – A Counselor's View", which argued that many discrimination complaints could be avoided "through adequate and meaningful communication." She noted that her progression and the progression of her black colleagues was limited at NASA and expressed frustration and anger at this. "The problem (blacks) had was moving into management and being over people," Scissum said. "I guess (NASA) was afraid people would fight against it. I guess. It's hard to understand. It's always been hard for me to understand – the motivation for all this discrimination, because most of it seems unnecessary. It doesn't even have a reason."

Entropy network

Entropy networks have been investigated in many research areas, on the assumption that entropy can be measured in a network. The embodiment of the network is often physical or informational. An entropy network is composed of entropy containers which are often called nodes, elements, features, or regions and entropy transfer occurs between containers. The transfer of entropy in networks was characterized by Schreiber in his transfer entropy.
Physical basis.
A discrete physical basis for entropy networks can be found in the observation, and discussions of discrete observations appear briefly in the work of Prokopenko, Lizier &amp; Price. More complete discussions of observations were offered by Leo Szilárd and Léon Brillouin.
Structures and motifs.
Network motifs have been proposed to be scale independent. Networks have been classified by total entropy. The entropy content of graphs has been considered throughout fields of math and computer science. 
Design of entropy networks and in depth investigation has been publicized by Wissner-Gross and Freer who have proposed a time entropy relation (where entropy is maximized of a lifespan) through which predictions of the emergence of complexity can be shown.
Domains of study.
The role of entropy networks in formation of structures is critical in engineering and its physical implications determine chirality, organize biological molecules, and quantify the topologies of condensed matter (mass) networks.

Aspark Owl

The "Aspark" Owl () is an all-electric battery-powered sports car manufactured by Japanese engineering firm Aspark (アスパーク), under development since 2018, with the goal of making the fastest accelerating electric car. It will be built by Manifattura Automobili Torino (MAT) in Italy. Aspark plans a production run of 50 vehicles, with a list price of €2.5 million. The OWL was publicly unveiled in concept form at the 2017 Frankfurt Auto Show, and the production version was unveiled in November 2019 at the Dubai International Motor Show.
Specifications and performance.
The OWL has carbon fibre body work built around a carbon fibre monocoque chassis weighing . A stainless steel support structure is incorporated in the roof to increase the bodywork's strength. Changes to the bodywork from the concept include the addition of wing mirrors, an active rear wing and a redesigned rear glass. The car features double wishbone suspension with hydraulic dampers and torque vectoring for improved handling. Stopping power is handled by a carbon-ceramic braking system with 10-piston front calipers and 4-piston rear calipers.
It has been claimed that the OWL can accelerate from 0- in 1.69 seconds, 0- in 1.9 seconds, 0- in 10.6 seconds, and can attain a top speed of , which would make it the fastest accelerating production car in the world. However, at least some of these claims are most likely unrealistic, due to the physical limits of automobile acceleration imposed by the friction of tires with the road, and a lack of convincing video evidence.
The 69 kWh battery pack was developed by Danecca Ltd, of Silverstone UK.
In popular culture.
The Aspark Owl appears as a playable festival-unlockable vehicle in the mobile game "." added in "2020 Spring Update" along with two other new cars: Ferrari SF90 Stradale &amp; DS E-TENSE. It is the first "Asphalt" appearance of new manufacturer, "Aspark".

Once in New York, Winkler formed her own theatre company called Everywhere Theatre Group. ETG produced Leah's plays as well as collaboratively written plays including Big Girls Club (2007), Dead People (2008 with Theodore Nicholas), Formula Play(2009), A Pale Horse Death Followed With: A Life Time Original Series (2008 with Theodore Nicholas) at downtown venues including The Brick, Dixon Place and the Ontological Hysteric Theater. In 2010 ETG's play The Internet (Incubator Arts Project) garnered favorable reviews in the New York Times. In 2011 "Flying Snakes in 3D!!", a science fiction parody meta-play about making a play when you aren't white and don't come from money ran at the Brick Theater before transferring to the New Ohio and stirred public heated debates regarding class privileged in the theater community. Leah was subsequently invited to present a manifesto regarding these issues at the Prelude Festival in 2012 alongside Richard Foreman and Mac Wellman. Shortly after ETG imploded. Leah continued to self-produce her short-form experimental work often at bars alongside poets and musicians. In 2013 Winkler published "Nagoriyuki And Other Short Plays: Performed in NYC between 2008-2013". In 2014, she had two plays "Death for Sydney Black" and "Diversity Awareness Picnic" on The Kilroys' List, a gender parity initiative highlighting underproduced works by female playwrights. In August 2014, Leah's play "Taisetsu Na Hito" was selected from an initial pool of 1,385 submissions to be performed at "Sam French's Offf Off Broadway Festival Plays, 39th series" It was published later that year.
In 2015, Winkler published another book of plays, "The Lowest Form of Writing" Her play "Double Suicide At Ueno Park" was produced by Ensemble Studio Theater. Her blog post about a yellowface production of The Mikado started a protest and led to further controversy.
In 2016, Winkler's play "Kentucky" was on the Kilroys list and had its world premiere at the Ensemble Studio Theatre as a co-production with the Radio Drama Network and Page 73 Productions in New York. The play garnered favorable reviews and the Times called her a "Distinctive New Voice"

Main Roads Western Australia controls the major roads in the state's Goldfields-Esperance region. While the region is the state's largest, the major roads are restricted to the region's western and southern edges. From the major population centres of Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie, Great Eastern Highway heads west towards Perth via the Wheatbelt (Western Australia); Coolgardie–Esperance Highway leads south to the port of Esperance via Norseman; and Goldfields Highway proceeds north to Wiluna and then on to the Mid West Region. From Norseman, Eyre Highway takes interstate traffic east across the Nullarbor Plain and into South Australia.
The main roads in the region are important for multiple aspects of the region's economy. This is primarily mining activities, but also includes pastoral and agricultural exports via Esperance port, tourism to both coastal and inland destinations, and interstate freight traffic, with approximately two million tonnes transported annually along the Great Eastern, Coolgardie–Esperance and Eyre highways.

All Ghillied Up

"All Ghillied Up" is a level in the 2007 first-person shooter video game ' and its remastered version, ' (2016). Set in Pripyat, Ukraine in 1996, the player assumes control of then Lieutenant Price and is assisted by their superior Captain MacMillan. The player may deal with enemies stealthily, overtly or avoid engaging them altogether. 
The name refers to the ghillie suits worn by the characters in the mission. It was designed by Mohammad Alavi initially in secret due to the difficulty of explaining its intricacies to the artificial intelligence (AI) programmer. It took Alavi three months and more than 10,000 lines of code to make the first minute of gameplay for the level. "All Ghillied Up" has since been recognized by critics as one of the greatest levels in video game history, being praised for its atmosphere, pacing, and player freedom.
Level content.
"All Ghillied Up" is the thirteenth level in "" single-player campaign. Set in an irradiated wasteland, the player's character, with the assistance of a non-player character (NPC) companion, proceeds through a timber building within a field, past a house, and through an abandoned church whilst taking out enemies. The player proceeds to another field where they encounter a platoon with tanks advancing across it, and hide from the enemies in the foliage using their ghillie suits in prone. They encounter another platoon with a helicopter and military vehicles, and must crawl under a series of these vehicles to avoid detection. They eventually reach an abandoned hotel to prepare for an assassination attempt.
At the time of its release, the level was the first in the series where NPCs could react differently based on the players' behavior like those seen in stealth video games. This allows NPCs to react differently based on whether they can detect the player. Throughout the level, the player is presented with numerous choices, to which MacMillan responds appropriately. Near the start of the level, once the player passes the abandoned churchyard, he will warn of an enemy helicopter flying above, telling the player to "get down". However, the player can choose to shoot the helicopter down using a FIM-92 Stinger found in the church, causing MacMillan to say "now you're just showin' off." In other instances, MacMillan will criticize the player character when he ruins their cover, and correct them when the player aims at the incorrect target.
Plot.
"All Ghillied Up" is presented as a flashback in which the player assumes control of Captain Price, as a lieutenant. It is set in 1996 in Pripyat, Ukraine, fifteen years before the events of the game. Pripyat is a town near Chernobyl which was abandoned after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. In the level, Price has to sneak across the wasteland, with his superior Captain MacMillan. The mission ends with MacMillan and Price setting up in the abandoned Polissya hotel to prepare for an assassination. The next mission, "One Shot, One Kill", concludes with a failed assassination attempt, a hurried retreat, and a final stand-off in front of the Pripyat amusement park ferris wheel.
Development.
"All Ghillied Up" was designed by Mohammad Alavi, who also designed "Crew Expendable", another level in "Modern Warfare", and "No Russian", a controversial level in the sequel "". Alavi studied games from the "Half-Life" and "Metal Gear Solid" video games series when creating the level. In it, non-player characters react differently to the player based on distance and angle, rather than a simple proximity trigger. For example, a player might lie prone in the grass and an enemy will not notice them. This code was created in secret by Alavi due to the difficulty of explaining its intricacies to the artificial intelligence (AI) programmer, who was already swamped with work. Alavi called the internal code "garbage", but said that it still "did exactly what [he] wanted it to do", and that he did not "have to compromise on the feel of the gameplay". It took Alavi three months and more than 10,000 lines of code to make the first minute of gameplay for the level. The lead designer, Steve Fukuda, played the first minute ten different ways and had fun each time, which Alavi considered to be a success. The script was later used as the basis for the AI in "Modern Warfare 2".
Initial reception.
Many publications highlighted "All Ghillied Up" as a standout among other levels in the game. "Official Xbox Magazine" Ryan McCaffrey praised "All Ghillied Up", opining that it was the best level in the game, and one of the best stealth levels in gaming. "Jolt Online Gaming" relished the level describing it as tense whilst Kristan Reed of "Eurogamer" described it as a bleak depiction of Chernobyl. Steve Hogarty of "Computer and Video Games" wrote that the level contains the best moments in the entire series. He went on to say that "All Ghillied Up" is a stealthy mission he had not seen anything like before, and that it is the high point of the game. Hogarty added that it was thrilling and a "moment of brilliance".
Numerous gaming outlets praised the section in which the player must crawl past enemy soldiers and tanks. Jeff Gerstmann writing for "GameSpot" recounted the section as a breathtaking moment while McCaffrey commended the segment for its high tension. Writing for "Destructoid", Earnest Cavalli described the section as "an experience that anyone with even a passing fetish for military ops absolutely must experience".
"GameDaily" Steven Wong noted that players will experience different outcomes depending on their skill level. "GameRevolution" compared the level to those seen in the "Metal Gear" series.
Retrospective commentary.
G.B. Burford of "Kotaku" called "All Ghillied Up" one of the best levels in video game history, citing its heavy freedom of choice in approaching the level. Comparing it to the game's previous level, "Safehouse", he remarked that, while the player could obey their commanding officer to get through the level successfully, they could also win by disobeying the officer's orders, and they would still back up the player, rather than simply killing their character for failing to obey. Burford also complimented the "incredibly tense" prone section as implementing the prone ability in an interesting way. "PC Gamer" said that "All Ghillied Up" was one of the strongest levels in "Modern Warfare", and that it "demonstrates the real craft of a linear story-driven first-person shooter". They went on to compare it to "DayZ", with its equally dramatic scenarios, and how it allowed for "personality and freeform set pieces".
"IGN" called the level one of the best stealth missions in games, and "Digital Trends" described it as among the greatest in any first-person shooter." "Ars Technica" Sam White compared the level's atmosphere and tension to that seen in the "Fallout" series. Sam Sant of "Game Revolution" said it was one of gaming's most iconic missions, also noting the ghillie suits worn in the mission are a fan favourite. "PlayStation Official Magazine – UK" called the level a "stealth masterclass", considering it to be the greatest level in a first-person shooter, and likely the best video game flashback of all time. The publication particularly praised the pacing and the degree of agency the level offers players. "The Telegraph" Adam Starkey named the level as one of the series' 10 most spectacular moments, describing it as "brilliantly tense", and calling it one of the greatest levels of the genre. Similarly, Sam Loveridge of "Digital Spy" classified "All Ghillied Up" as one of the best levels in the genre. Loveridge went on to acclaim the level's tension and described it as a "masterpiece of game design".
Humza Aamir of "Techspot" said the level was the most intense in the entire story and described it as infamous. "GamesRadar+"s Leon Hurley wrote that the mission is "a masterpiece of tension and pacing", and that its recognizable setting and flow "make a level that's better than some entire games." Ben Tyrer of "GamesRadar+" praised the level and compared it to "The Gulag", a level in "Modern Warfare 2", writing they were both the "defining moments" in their respective stories as one similarity. He opined that "All Ghillied Up" is "Modern Warfare"s best level because it encourages players to avoid combat instead of embracing it. Tyrer went on to call it the "tense, thoughtful soul of the series" for its message of violence begets violence. Richard Moss of "Gamasutra" noted a stark difference in the level compared to other first-person shooter stealth missions. This difference being if the player gets spotted in "All Ghillied Up" the game will not have a fail screen, instead giving the player the chance defend against many enemy soldiers. Moss went on to praise the tension and suspense and said it provides "a compelling argument that artful stealth design is more about the experience than the mechanics." Writing for "Gamasutra", Mark Davies used All Ghillied Up as an example in examining pace in single-player games of which he described it as a "master class in forced pacing". "Ars Technica" said the level introduces parallels between Price and the game's main player character Soap MacTavish.
Legacy.
"All Ghillied Up" was referenced in the movie "Hardcore Henry", whose director, Ilya Naishuller called it one of the best levels of all time. In 2019's "", a soft reboot of the sub series, players can unlock the "All Ghillied Up" pack which allows players to wear a ghillie suit and wield a bolt-action sniper rifle, in camouflage with additional netting and silencer similar to that seen in the mission.

Julia Belluz graduated from the Ryerson School of Journalism in 2007. She went on to earn an MSc from the London School of Economics, followed by an internship for the "Times of London." 
In 2013–2014, she was a Knight Science Journalism Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a program designed to allow science journalists to study alongside scientists. Belluz's study focused on the relationship between science and policy. Of the program, Belluz said, "It’s important to not only understand the science you’re reporting on but also the culture of science."
Career.
In 2009, after a year of working at newspapers and magazines in London, Belluz moved back to Canada for an entry level reporter job at "Maclean's." During her time at "Maclean's," Belluz created the blog "Science-ish" "in response to bewildering and contradictory claims ... that float around in the popular discourse."

Somerset Graves Site

Somerset Graves Site is a heritage-listed cemetery at Somerset, Northern Peninsula Area Region, Queensland, Australia. It is also known as Somerset Jardine Cemetery. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 January 2018.
History.
The Somerset Graves Site, on the northwest edge of Somerset Bay, Cape York, is known to contain seven marked interments, including the graves of Francis (Frank) Lascelles Jardine (1919), three members of his family (, 1923, 1962), two pearl divers (1890, 1909), and an unidentified grave; as well as a memorial to Frank and Sana Jardine (1924); and the Kennedy Memorial Monument (1948). The site is a remnant of the original settlement of the town of Somerset, established in 1864 as a joint venture between the Queensland Government and the British Government as a port of refuge and refuelling depot. The known burials date from 1890 to 1962. The site has the potential to contribute knowledge that will lead to a greater understanding of Somerset's inhabitants and burial practices. It has a special association with the Jardine family, early settlers of Cape York Peninsula.
With its separation from New South Wales on 10 December 1859, the new colony of Queensland acquired over of coastline extending as far north as Cape York Peninsula. The colony's first parliament passed a resolution in 1860 favouring direct connection with England via the Torres Strait. In December 1861, Sir George Ferguson Bowen (1821–99), Governor of Queensland (1859–67), described the necessity for a station in the far north of Queensland. From a naval and military point of view, a post at or near Cape York would be valuable, due to the establishment of a French colony and naval station in New Caledonia. Bowen informed Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle, Secretary of State for the Colonies, that the government of Queensland would be willing to undertake the formation and management of a station at Cape York and to support a civil establishment there.
On 27 August 1862, Bowen left Brisbane on HMS Pioneer to select an eligible site for the proposed settlement. The chosen site, opposite Albany Island, was named Somerset, in honour of the First Lord of the Admiralty, Edward Seymour, 12th Duke of Somerset.
Tenders were called for the construction of government buildings in March 1863, a town survey was undertaken in July 1864 and the Town Reserve of Somerset was established on 8 July 1864. A survey plan dated 13 March 1865 included Parcel 24, within which the graves are located. Parcel 24 comprised approximately . The first Somerset land sale was held in Brisbane on 4 April 1865 and a second sale took place on 2 May 1866. Land parcels sold at these auctions were about in size, so did not include parcel number 24.
Earlier, in February 1864, John Jardine (1807–74) was appointed Somerset's first Police Magistrate and Commissioner of Crown Lands and in July 1864 he was appointed District Registrar for the District of North Cook. An early sketch of Somerset by Jardine shows the Government Residence, Police Magistrate's House and Customs House on the southern side of Somerset Bay, and Marines' Barracks and the Medical Superintendent's House on the northern side. Henry Simpson succeeded Jardine as Police Magistrate in 1866. The Marines were withdrawn in 1867 and replaced with Native Police.
John Jardine was the father of Francis (Frank) Lascelles Jardine (1841-1919) and Alexander (Alick) William Jardine (1843-1920) who, between May 1864 and March 1865, undertook an overland expedition from Rockhampton to Cape York which was described at the time as, geographically:"solving the question of the course of the northern rivers emptying into the Gulf of Carpentaria of which nothing was known but their outlets. It has also made known...how much ... or rather, how little, of the 'York Peninsula' is adapted for pastoral occupation, whilst its success in taking the first stock overland, and forming a cattle station at Newcastle Bay, has ensured to the Settlement at Somerset a necessary and welcome supply of fresh meat...".The Jardine River was named after them by order of Governor Bowen. For their pioneering exploratory efforts the Jardine brothers were made Fellows of the Royal Geographical Society and awarded the Society's Murchison Award, in 1886.
Several Indigenous groups occupied this region prior to European contact. In an 1896 report to the Queensland Government, Archibald Meston estimated that in the 1870s the Indigenous population between Newcastle Bay () and Cape York was around 3000. At the time of writing his report, he believed that the population had fallen to around 300. This rapid decline was caused by a number of factors, including introduced disease, exclusions from traditional hunting grounds and frontier violence. Reverend Frederick Charles Jagg, a missionary at Somerset appointed by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, gave an indication of the relationship between European and Indigenous peoples when he reported in 1867 that "The aborigines have been described as the most degraded, treacherous and bloodthirsty beings in existence by the present Police Magistrate, and those whose only idea is to shoot them down whenever they were seen".
Frank Jardine was appointed as a Magistrate in December 1867 and as Police Magistrate and Inspector of Police at Somerset in April 1868. In 1869 he held the positions of District Registrar for Somerset, Police Magistrate, Clerk of Petty Sessions, Inspector of Police and Postmaster. He married Samoan woman, Sana Sofala, in 1873 and the couple had four children: Alice Maule Lascelles, Hew Cholmondeley (Chum), Bootle Arthur Lascelles (Bertie) and Elizabeth Sana Hamilton. Frank Jardine's tenure as a government officer in Somerset was not without controversy. The local Indigenous population was dispossessed and there was hostility between them and the Jardine family; both during Frank and Alick Jardine's expedition to Somerset, and during the years of the settlement. Jardine was also suspended for a time from his duties as Police Magistrate whilst being investigated in relation to using his position to obtain a pearl diving licence.
Somerset became redundant as a port once a safer shipping route to the Torres Strait was found and a settlement on Thursday Island was built from 1876. Frank Jardine continued to live at Somerset, maintaining the police residence until his death there in March 1919. During this time, Jardine continued to maintain a beef cattle herd; was engaged in the pearling industry; and created a coconut/copra plantation at Somerset. Due to Somerset's isolated location the Jardine family provided assistance and hospitality to travellers and seafarers, for example, Jardine aided the survivors of the shipwreck of RMS Quetta in 1890.
Jardine was buried in the south area of the Somerset Grave Site in 1919, and his grave protected by a timber fence. His wife, Sana, who died in 1923, was buried nearby. A memorial to Frank and Sana Jardine was installed in 1924 by their family. In 1935 the graves of Frank and Sana Jardine were described as lying side by side, surmounted by tombstones and surrounded by a fence made out of old ship's timber and anchor chains. Buried in close proximity is Frank Jardine's grandson, (Cholmondeley) Gordon Vidgen (1903-1962). Other graves in this part of the Somerset Grave Site are said to be of Sana's mother () and possibly two children.
Jardine was not the first to be buried in the Somerset Grave Site (labelled section one when the parcel of land was leased as Special Lease 2894 in early 1920 by Frank's son, Bertie Jardine). The earliest known burial was that of Cancan, a pearl diver, dating to 1890. Japanese pearl diver Kobori Itchimatsu was also buried there in 1909. Both graves are situated in the north area of the site. The pearl diving industry was important in Torres Strait and to the Queensland economy, and came to be dominated by Japanese divers after 1891. Kobori Itchimatsu came from the village of Nishi Mukai in Wakayama prefecture, an area that provided 80 per cent of the 7000 Japanese who left their country to become pearl divers.
The Kennedy Memorial Monument, also within the Somerset Graves Site, located beside the path between the north and south areas of the site was unveiled on 13 December 1948 in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Edmund Besley Court Kennedy's unsuccessful exploration of Cape York Peninsula. The monument comprises a concrete slab on a concrete footing with a bronze commemorative plaque on its eastern face.
There is limited evidence about other burial sites at Somerset. The principal source for information about them is Frank Reid (1884-1947) who gives conflicting information about the number and location of burial sites. His book, based on a visit to Somerset and published in 1954, provides a map of the cemetery sites at Somerset and on Albany Island - showing that the lone grave of Captain Archibald McAusland (22 Mar 1874) is located on high ground to the east of Somerset Bay, while about 40 European graves exist in a hill-side cemetery outside the boundary of the township, to the west of Frank Jardine's residence and south of the Somerset Graves Site. However, the text accompanying this map and a newspaper article from 1937 quoting Reid, talk of only one other cemetery site at Somerset in addition to the Somerset Graves Site, and imply that McAusland was buried with the other Europeans. Reid states the interments in the second cemetery are: two Royal Marines, several Burketown residents, who were brought to Somerset to recover from fever, but who died soon after arrival, and Madame Boisse, wife of a commandant at New Caledonia. Public records show other deaths occurred at Somerset, including the two infant daughters of Somerset's medical officer, Dr Timotheus John Haran, RN.
Following the death of their parents, sons Bertie and Chum leased section 12 (on which the former Police Magistrate's house was located) and section one under special lease arrangements. In 1948, the area under Special Lease 2984 (section one) was described as having been leased by Bertie Jardine for "sentimental purposes, where his father and mother were buried...". At this time, section one was incorporated into R.10, a Reserve for the Benefit of Aboriginals, which also included the Somerset town reserve. In 1973, R.10 was reduced in size and become two lots, including Lot 43 Plan SO65 (which included the Somerset Graves Site). Finally, in July 1999, Lot 43 Plan SO65 was cancelled and the current lot, Lot 7 SP104552 was created. This newly created lot captured all known or marked graves.
In 2011 the Angkamuthi Seven Rivers, the McDonnell Atampaya and the Gudang/Yadhaigana groups made an application for native title determination over the Northern Peninsula Area Regional Council and Cook Shire areas, covering an area of approximately 685,642 hectares. The determination was handed down on 30 October 2014. Lot 7 SP104552 is contained within the exclusive areas of the determination.
In 2017, the Somerset Graves Site remains as a remnant of the once-important regional centre of Somerset. It is the burial site of Frank Jardine, a well-known far north Queensland identity, members of his family, and other identified and unidentified members of the isolated Cape York community.
Description.
The Somerset Graves Site comprising Lot 7 SP104552 is located immediately inland of the northern section of Somerset Bay, Cape York. Within the lot are two areas of graves: the north grave area and the south grave area. Due to dense vegetation (which is not significant) the north grave area is not visible from the south grave area and vice versa. The north grave area contains the graves of two pearl divers and the south grave area contains the graves of Jardine family members. The south grave area is accessed by a sand track which connects to Somerset Road. The north grave area is accessed from the beach of Somerset Bay or a narrow sand track from the south grave area. The north grave area, located directly inland from the beach of Somerset Bay, has experienced considerable sand deposition. On the track between the two grave areas is the Kennedy Memorial Monument.
Two marked graves were identified within the north grave area. According to a 1987 survey by the Material Culture Unit of the James Cook University a third unmarked grave is located between the two marked graves, however, due to considerable sand accumulation the unmarked grave was unable to be identified. The first marked grave, located in the north-western section of the north grave area belongs to "Cancan". The grave consists of a marble headstone wide and high from the current ground level. There is a transverse crack across the headstone which is held together by fencing wire and a star picket. There are the remains of bounding beach rocks around the grave, however, only the eastern extent, located from the headstone, is clearly discernible. The headstone has the following inscription:
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF CANCAN - (A GOOD MAN AND TRUE ) - DIED JUNE 21. 1890 - AGED 32 YEARS.
The second marked grave of the north grave area belongs to Kobori Ichimatsu. The grave is located in the middle of the southern section of the grave area. The grave consists of a concrete cenotaph, placed on a stepped base which is wider than the cenotaph and has a height of . The cenotaph is wide and high. The top articulation of the cenotaph is chamfered. The monument is not placed in the centre of the concrete base but appears to be deliberately offset, although this may be the result of repair work. The cenotaph is surrounded by local beach rocks in an elliptical shape approximately (north/south) by (east/west). The monument has been painted in a white lime wash. There is an inscription on three faces of the monument (the east, south and west faces). The inscription is in Japanese and has been painted black. The black paint has discoloured the monument face. The following is a translation of the inscription:
Southern face - Kobori [Family name] Ichimatsu's [First name] grave
Eastern face - Meiji Forty Two [forty second year of the Emperor Meiji - which is the year 1909] spring died
Western face - Wakayama prefecture Higashi [east] ___ city - Nishi Mukai village - Kobori [Family name] Otomatsu [First name] built
The Kennedy Memorial Monument is located on the track between the north and south grave areas. The monument consists of a concrete slab on a stepped concrete footing on a beach rock base. The concrete slab is wide by deep and high. The monument appears to be pre-formed concrete and is painted in a white acrylic paint. The concrete footing is cracked on the south-east and north-east corners. The top, eastern and northern faces have been discoloured by lichen. The slab has a slight lean towards the north. There is a bronze plaque on the eastern face commemorating the Kennedy Expedition. The plaque has the following embossed inscription:Edmund Besley Court Kennedy J.P. with a party of 12 men landed at Rockhampton Bay 24 May 1848 to explore Cape York Peninsula. He was fatally speared in December 1848 at Escape River within sight of his goal. Six of his companions died at Waymouth Bay and three near Shelbourne Bay. Faithful aborigine Jackey-Jackey, E. Carron and W. Goddard were the only survivors. Unveiled 13 December 1948.The south grave area contains the remains of Jardine family members. There are four marked graves and one memorial. Only one grave has an inscription indicating who is buried in the grave. The first marked grave, located at the northern extent of this grave area consists of a roughly carved stone grave marker painted with a white lime wash. The headstone is wide (at its widest point) and high. There is no inscription on this grave marker to identify its occupant; however, from the size of the grave it may belong to a child. The grave is surrounded by beach rock and is approximately long by wide. Within the rock surrounds is a soil fill decorated with a circle of iron chain, shells (mainly oyster shells) and pieces of coral have been placed within the chain circle. Historical references refer to a fence made out of old ships' timbers and anchor chains surrounding the site; several of the graves, including this northern one have been decorated with thick iron chain. The grave is separated from, and orientated perpendicular to the other graves in this area, along a north–south rather than east–west orientation.
The next most northerly grave is considerably larger than all the other graves in this area, measuring (north/south) by (east/west). According to family knowledge this grave is a family plot and belongs to Frank Jardine (southern section of the grave) and possibly Sana's mother (northern section of the grave). The considerable size of the grave supports this. The grave has a concrete border. Within the concrete border are rocks, and the centre of the feature appears to be a soil fill. It is possible that the concrete was added to reinforce the boundary rocks.
Next to this large grave is a memorial to Frank Jardine and Sana Jardine. The memorial is set on a beach rock footing. Set on top of the footing is a concrete base with short concrete posts reinforced by metal, located around the edge of the base which is wide. A chain has been used to surround this base and the links in the chain have been placed over these short posts. Within this base is a concrete cenotaph. The cenotaph appears to be pre-cast and has a stepped base of three levels which has been painted with white acrylic paint. On the northern face of the base of the cenotaph is a bronze plaque which is inscribed with:A.D. 1924/B.L. JardineOn top of this base is the cenotaph which appears to have been designed to look like a brick stack. There is a large crack along the northern face of the monument. The cenotaph (including the base) measures high. Each face of the cenotaph contains a rebated space for a bronze plaque, but only two plaques on the southern and northern face remain.Southern plaque: In loving memory of my dear mother. Died 21st Sept. 1923.Northern plaque: In loving memory of my dear father. Died 10st March. 1919.The memorial is believed to have been placed between the graves of Frank and Sana Jardine. The identification of their graves is supported by the remaining plaques of the memorial - the southern face plaque is dedicated to Sana and faces what is believed to be Sana's grave, and the northern face plaque is dedicated to Frank and faces what is believed to be Frank's grave.
The grave on the southern side of this monument is believed to be Sana Jardine's grave. This identification is based on family knowledge. This grave is enclosed by regular concrete blocks painted with white acrylic paint. Within these blocks are beach stones - most apparent at the western and eastern extent of the grave. The grave measures long by wide. The grave has a soil fill with coral pieces placed within the grave area.
The final grave of the south grave area is the only one with an inscribed headstone. It belongs to Cholmondeley Gordon Vidgen, Sana and Frank's grandson, who died in December 1962. The grave is surrounded by pieces of irregular, broken concrete blocks. The extent of the grave delineated by the concrete blocks is long by wide. The grave has a soil fill and a plaque has been placed at its western extent. Above the plaque is a small glass vase. A chain, similar to that used in other graves of the site (and may be related to the chain that originally surrounded the site) has been placed around the plaque. The plaque has a cross engraved onto its southern edge. The marble inset into the concrete plaque has the following inscription:Dec. 1962. Here lies Gordon Vidgen. True son of the North. Always remembered by his wife and children.Both grave areas are surrounded by reinforced concrete posts which create two rectangular enclosures around the grave areas. Four posts surround the north grave area and 10 posts surround the south grave area. The posts are painted white. There are tubular steel rail openings in the posts. Barbed wire is evident through the openings of some the posts in the south grave area. The style of the posts varies, possibly indicating replacement over time.
Heritage listing.
Somerset Graves Site was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 January 2018 having satisfied the following criteria.
The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.
As a remnant of the Somerset settlement, the Somerset Graves Site (1890-1962) is important in demonstrating the early initiative of the Queensland Government to create a settlement and port on Cape York for maritime, civil and military purposes. From 1864 until 1876, Somerset acted as the regional centre for Cape York. Afterwards it remained one of the few Cape York settlements available to provide assistance to travellers and seafarers. This early settlement was also the site of conflict between Europeans and traditional owners; and was associated with the pearling industry in the Torres Strait, and early attempts at pastoralism and agriculture on Cape York.
The pearl divers' graves in the Somerset Graves Site are representative of the important and hazardous Queensland pearling industry, which operated from the 1870s and relied upon a multi-ethnic work force.
The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history.
The Somerset Graves Site has the potential to contribute knowledge that will lead to a greater understanding of Somerset's inhabitants and burial practices. There is limited information about the deaths and burials of Somerset's inhabitants. The Somerset Graves Site is known to contain seven marked graves and at least one unmarked grave and it is possible that a larger number of Somerset's inhabitants were interred at this site. Archaeological investigation of the graves site has the potential to reveal the presence, nature and extent of burials at this site, their spatial distribution and arrangement, as well as the burial practices of the diverse inhabitants of the settlement.
The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.
The Somerset Graves Site, which includes the known graves of at least three Jardine family members, has a special association with the Jardine family, who were closely connected with the European exploration, settlement and development of Cape York from 1864 until the mid-20th century.
Members of the Jardine family had a lengthy, and at times controversial, connection to the area. John Jardine snr and his son Francis (Frank) Lascelles Jardine held important government positions based at Somerset. The Jardine brothers, Francis (Frank) Lascelles and Alexander (Alick) William, were early overland explorers from Rockhampton to Somerset, bringing the first cattle into Cape York. As a result of this feat, the Jardine River was named after them, and in 1886 they were made Fellows of the Royal Geographical Society and received its Murchison Award.

Cumberland Plain Woodland

The Cumberland Plain Woodland is one of six main indigenous woodland communities of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, that comprises an open tree canopy, a groundcover with grasses and herbs, usually with layers of shrubs and/or small trees. Situated in the Cumberland Plain, it is made up of dry sclerophyll woodlands, grasslands and/or forests, reminiscent of Mediterranean forests and temperate grasslands. 
According to Office of Environment and Heritage, the community falls predominantly within the "Coastal Valley Grassy Woodlands" region, which are part of the "Grassy Woodlands" formation found in the eastern corridor New South Wales, barring the coastline.
Currently, less than 6% of the Woodlands remain in small parts distributed across the western suburbs of Sydney, totaling only around 6400 hectares. Cumberland Plain Woodland was listed as an Endangered Ecological Community under the "Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995" in June 1997. The greatest threats to the Cumberland Plain Woodland include land clearing for agriculture, urban sprawl and the introduction of harmful weed species.
Geography.
In 1877, "Cumberland Plain Woodlands" covered 107,000 hectares and filled around 30% of the Sydney Basin. At the time of European settlement, the Cumberland Plain contained 1,070 km² of woodlands and forests. The westward expansion of Sydney over the plain has placed enormous pressure on the woodlands and other local ecological communities, only 13% of which remain uncleared.
Situated in the cities of Fairfield, Liverpool, Cumberland, Campbelltown, Blacktown and Penrith, and surrounds, they contain approximately 2000 ha (one-fifth) of the remaining Cumberland Plain Woodland. The ecoregion contains clay soils derived from Wianamatta Shale. The ecoregion is located on a rain shadow area, usually getting 700–900 mm of annual rainfall, to the west of Sydney CBD. Its range does not extend to slightly wetter Sydney Turpentine-Ironbark Forest, or high-rainfall ridges (such as Blue Gum High Forest in the upper North Shore).
The biotic community is mostly found on flat or hilly terrains up to about 350 m in elevation, but it may also be present on locally precipitous sites and at slightly higher elevations. Some parts of the community may have a forest structure. The Woodland features an open tree canopy, groundcover prevailed by grasses and herbs, sometimes with layers of shrubs and small trees.
Examples of the remnants can be seen at Scheyville National Park, Rosford Street Reserve, Brenan Park, Central Gardens Nature Reserve, Fairfield Park Precinct, Kemps Creek, Mulgoa, Prospect Hill in Pemulwuy, Prospect Nature Reserve, Wetherill Park Nature Reserve and Chipping Norton Lake, among other places.
Ecoregions.
The Cumberland Plain Woodland, classed under "Coastal Valley Grassy Woodlands", includes these ecoregions in its realm, with some overlapping and others plainly being sub-ecoregions of the Woodland:
Vegetation.
The sclerophyll woodlands are situated on a nutrient-poor alluvium deposited by the Nepean River from sandstone and shale bedrock in the Blue Mountains. Despite this, they support a tremendous regional biodiversity.
Cumberland Plain Woodland are dominated by Grey Box ("Eucalyptus moluccana") and Forest Red Gum (E. tereticornis), with Narrow-leaved Ironbark ("Eucalyptus crebra"), Spotted Gum ("Corymbia maculata") and Thin-leaved Stringybark ("Eucalyptus eugenioides") occurring sporadically. The ecoregion may have an open layer of small trees that would include such species of "Acacia decurrens", "Acacia parramattensis", "Acacia implexa" and "Exocarpos cupressiformis". The shrub layer is mainly contains "Bursaria spinosa", "indigofera australis", "Hardenbergia violacea", "Daviesia ulicifolia", "Lespedeza cuneata", "Dillwynia", "Dodonaea viscosa", with plenty grasses such as Kangaroo Grass ("Themeda australis") and Weeping Meadow Grass ("Microlaena stipoides").
Other eucalyptus species within the Woodland include:
Non-eucalyptus trees:
Shrubs:
Grasses and sedge:
Wildlife.
Bird species in the woodland include (which are mostly vulnerable and/or endangered): 
Mammals:

Prepomatodelphis

Prepomatodelphis is an extinct genus of river dolphin from Early Miocene marine deposits in Austria.
Classification.
"Prepomatodelphis" belongs to the platanistid subfamily Pomatodelphininae, which is distinguished from the South Asian river dolphin in having a flattened rostrum, a transversely expanded posterior end of the premaxilla, an eye and bony orbit of normal size (not atrophied), and nasal bones not reduced in size but wide transversely. Features distinguishing "Prepomatodelphis" from "Pomatodelphis" include smaller size, cranium with surface of the premaxillary sac fossa undulating, having in its midpart a sulcus bounded both medially and laterally by a ridge, and sloping ventrally at both its medial and lateral margins, and zygomatic process of squamosal very deep dorsoventrally in the posterior part.

Casisang

Casisang (Binukid: "Báriyu Kasisang") is the most populous of the 46 barangays of Malaybalay. It is the seat of government of the City of Malaybalay since the City Hall is located here. Situated in the South Highway District of Malaybalay, Casisang borders on the north with the Poblacion barangays of Barangay 11, Barangay 7, and Barangay 9, on the east with Can-ayan, on the south with San Jose, Magsaysay, and Mapayag, and on the West by Imbayao and Kalasungay. According to 2015 census Casisang has a population of 25,696 people.
History.
Under Spanish rule, Barangay Casisang was part of the Barangay Población of Malaybalay. Leaders of Malaybalay extend services to Casisang like in the person of Mr. Esteban Tilanducâ who was delegated as "capitán" of Malaybalay. He was the mediator between the people and the government. People turn to him for their financial and economic problems. He owned a vast land in the barangay and hired people to work in his farm. Tilanducâ was considered as one of the original settlers of Barangay Casisang. Despite the organization of the community, the natives nonetheless preferred to stay in the forest in fear or dissatisfaction toward Spanish administration. Only when the Americans came, the people eventually learned to settle in the plains. They began to organize communities under a Datù designated as tribal leader. Schools were established which contributed to the economic growth of the community and the life of the people.
Barangay Casisang was separated from Poblacion, Malaybalay and became a regular barangay in February 7, 1961, under Resolution # 14-Series of 1961.
Geography.
Casisang is situated in a gently sloping area and in the west it is gradually rising as it touches the foothills of Mt. Kitanglad Range. On the east, the Sawaga River cuts Casisang from its component Sitio Natid-asan where hills make a boundary with Barangay Can-ayan. The Mamalá Creek separates Casisang from Impalambong, Kalasungay, and Imbayao. The Kalawaig Creek, on the other hand, separates Casisang and Barangay 9.
Casisang is roughly divided into "sitios":
Demography.
Casisang is a population centre of Malaybalay since there are many housing projects erected there. The Malaybalay Airport was closed and was converted into a low-cost housing project by the provincial government of Bukidnon. The housing project increased the population of Casisang into 25,696, making it the most populous barangay in Malaybalay and second in Bukidnon (after Poblacion, Valencia City).
Education.
Casisang is part of the Division of Malaybalay City by the Department of Education. It has several public elementary schools located in populated areas and sitios. It has two secondary schools that offer junior and senior high school courses. The list below only includes public schools.

Metachroma

Metachroma is a genus of leaf beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae. It is distributed from Ontario, Canada to Mendoza, Argentina, including the Antilles (where a large number of species occur). It has also been suggested that the genus extends to the Pacific Islands, though this is not confirmed. There are about 140 described species in "Metachroma", 40 of which are found north of Mexico. An extinct species is also known from the Eocene of the United States.
The name of the genus comes from the Ancient Greek ("different") and ("color"), referring to the variations in color pattern found within many of the species.
Species.
The following five species from Cuba described by Suffrian in 1866, some of which were renamed by Clavareau in 1914, were considered doubtful by Doris Holmes Blake in her 1970 review of the genus. However, since she was not able to examine the original specimens for them, they remained unknown to her.

Masterpiece (The Master's Apprentices album)

Masterpiece is the second studio album by The Masters Apprentices, released in February 1970 on Columbia Records.
Background.
The Masters Apprentices had been stockpiling tracks since they signed with EMI in 1969. 1969 began with The Masters Apprentices settling their new line-up and the Ford/Keays writing team hitting its stride, the band now moved to its best-remembered and most successful phase. The first EMI single, released in March 1969 was "Linda Linda" / "Merry-Go-Round" and was the beginning of a short but successful collaboration with New Zealand-born producer Howard Gable. 
The second single, the rocky "5:10 Man", released in July, which peaked at No. 16 on the "Go-Set" Singles Chart and initiated a string of Top 20 hits. It was a deliberate move towards a heavier sound, as the band were keen to move away from the current bubblegum craze that their manager and producer wanted.
During this period, Ford/Keays struggled to write new material due to the band's hectic live performance schedule. In February 1970, the second LP "Masterpiece" was finally released. Although something of a hodgepodge—as Keays freely admits—it showed the band developing a much broader range. It included the singles "Linda Linda" and "5:10 Man". The title track, a live recording, provides a vivid aural snapshot of their live show during 1968, complete with the deafening screams of fans. The album also includes their own version of "St John's Wood", a track Ford and Keays wrote for Brisbane band The Sect, who had released it as a single on Columbia during the year.
Reception.
The album's retrospective reviews have been mixed. Allmusic's Richie Unterberger said "It's a respectable but oddly schizophrenic effort, finding them searching for an identity with competent forays into hard rock, early progressive rock, and poppy folk-rock, with orchestral instrumental links between many of the tracks adding to the confusion (as there's no concept driving the LP)."
When writing about the album in Freedom Train, Australian rock journalist Ian McFarlane was complimentary of several of the album's tracks, but said that "Linda, Linda" and "Piece Of Me" were "just plain bad". "Part of the problem lays in the fact that the band are concerned with making the obligatory profound musical statement (the first side had all the tracks segued into one another in the manner of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's, each linked by a short orchestral piece). As a result the album comes over as all solemn and self consciously arty, and is totally overblown. "

Waaje Fire Tower No.4

Waaje Fire Tower No.4 is a heritage-listed fire lookout tower at Barakula State Forest, Barakula, Western Downs Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1964 by Arthur Leis. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 January 2018.
History.
Waaje Fire Tower No.4, located in Barakula State Forest over north-northwest of Chinchilla, is a four-legged timber (Type G) fire tower with cabin, with single-length grey ironbark poles and a total height of approximately . It was erected in May 1964 by Arthur Leis, for the Queensland Forestry Department, to help pinpoint fire outbreaks within valuable native forest. It was the first Queensland fire tower to exceed in height, and is now the tallest surviving intact four-legged timber fire tower, the tallest Queensland timber fire tower with single-length poles, and the last intact 1960s four-legged timber fire tower. It and the other staffed fire towers in Queensland have been rendered obsolete by a shift to using remote camera surveillance to detect fires, instead of on-site human observers.
Barakula State Forest, established in 1907, was part of Queensland Government's efforts to conserve native forests for sustainable forestry. Of Queensland's natural resources, timber was the most obvious and abundant to the first Europeans, and the timber industry played a vital role in the economic development of Queensland, while also providing its most important building material. From the earliest days of non-Indigenous occupation, Queensland's native timbers were exploited; by timber getters, as well as by settlers clearing agricultural or pastoral land. The first timber reserves, gazetted in 1870, were aimed at protecting timber for future railway use. The construction of railways, which both promoted closer settlement and increased access to timber resources, also used hardwood timber for sleepers.
Efforts began in the late 19th century to save the timber resource from being totally exhausted. The Crown Lands Act 1876 prohibited cutting of certain species on vacant Crown Land or pastoral leases, and placed girth limits on cutting pine and cedar, while the Crown Lands Act 1884 enabled the Queensland Government to reserve State Forests on Crown Land, and seek royalties from licensed timber getters on Crown Lands. However, these laws could not compete with the dominant philosophy of the time, which was to promote settlement and development. By 1885, there were 161 Timber Reserves (covering 636,484ha) and 16 State Forests (81,980ha) but the 1880s were also boom years for timber exploitation in Queensland.
During the 1890s there was increased concern that government revenue was being lost to unregulated timber exploitation. The creation of the Forestry Branch in 1900 within the Lands Department represented a shift in approach. While the responsibility for leasing timber reserves and reservation of Crown Lands for forestry initially stayed with the Lands Department, the Forestry Branch became responsible for reforestation, research, land acquisition, the control and prohibition of fires, surveys, timber harvesting and marketing (including roads and logging), sawmill licenses, and (eventually) national park management. The first staff consisted of an Inspector of Forests and two Forest Rangers. Forestry staff numbers were: 5 in 1906, 1900 in 1939, and 2127 in 1965-1966.
Phillip MacMahon's appointment as Director of Forests (1905-10) marked the beginning of professional forestry in Queensland, and Minister for Lands Joshua Bell introduced the "State Forests and National Parks Bill" in November 1906. This allowed the permanent reservation of Crown Land for State Forests and National Parks, within which alienation of land was prohibited without an Act of Parliament, although there were special purpose and occupation licenses. Holders of leases and licenses could not cut timber without authorisation. The State Forests and National Parks Act 1906 took effect on 1 January 1907.
The quality of the ironbark trees in the Chinchilla District had been commented on in 1906 by FW Wade, State Forest Ranger, when he inspected the country north of the Western Railway between Chinchilla and Miles. The main trees in this area at the time were narrow-leafed ironbark ("Eucalyptus crebra"), spotted gum ("Eucalyptus maculata") and red and black cypress pine ("Callitris spp"). Ironbark (a fire tolerant hardwood) and cypress pine (a fire sensitive softwood) were already being cut, with new sawmills opening in the area. In 1935 it was also reported that there were large supplies of valuable timber such as cypress pine, spotted gum, and narrow leaf ironbark, in the Dalby forestry district.
On 8 June 1907, a Reserve for a State Forest was created in the Dalby and Taroom Land Agent's Districts, under The State Forests and National Parks Act 1906, covering 479 square miles (306,560 acres or 124,060ha), in the counties of Newcastle, Auburn, Lytton; and the parishes of Coondarra, Goldsmith, Malcolm, Macdonald, Ballon and Burncluith. In 1908 the first National Parks were declared in Queensland: Witches Falls National Park at Tamborine Mountain and Bunya Mountains National Park. Barakula State Forest was the largest in Queensland and it remains so in 2017, covering 283,500ha. It is also the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. In 1908 the next largest State Forest, of 46,720 acres (18,907ha), was on the Blackdown Tableland Forest Reserve in the Rockhampton District.
By 1912, a railway had been built into the State Forest, from Chinchilla, in order to obtain hardwood sleepers for the railways, and the terminus was named Barakula, the Aboriginal term for "big timber". A timber mill was also established at Barakula by the Queensland Government, and the State Forest was called Barakula State Forest by 1927.
During the early 20th century, there was increased government concern about the depletion of native timber supplies. Under Norman William Jolly and then Edward Swain as Director of Forests (1911-1918, and 1918-1932 respectively), the Queensland Government established native softwood (hoop pine) plantations and attempted to regenerate native forest areas. The Forestry Branch applied silvicultural (forest cultivation) improvement regimes, including ringbarking old and unproductive trees, regeneration burns, and slashing new growth competing with seedlings. Under Swain, offices were established in six forestry regions: Atherton, Brisbane, Bundaberg-Rockhampton, Gympie, Maryborough, and Dalby (Barakula State Forest lies within the latter). By 1919 there were five nurseries, 27 plantations, and 23 regeneration areas.
Part of the work of the Forestry Branch, and its later incarnations, was protecting plantations and State Forests from fire. The Provisional Forestry Board was created in 1924 with Forestry becoming a sub-department of the Department of Lands in 1932, and an independent department in 1957. Consideration was given to the need for effective fire protection as early as 1911, when it was discussed at an Interstate Conference on Forestry held in Sydney. As the new Forestry Branch initially had few resources, fire protection was limited to roads and firebreaks, with fire spotters operating from natural high points and trees. During the 1930s, the Forestry Branch applied a fire exclusion policy, where fire breaks were created adjacent to the forest to be protected, with no burn-offs within the State Forest or reserve. The early detection of any wildfires within the protected forests was thus vital. This policy continued into the 1940s and 1950s but a series of bad fires in the 1950s and early 1960s led to a reappraisal of the exclusion policy (which had led to a build-up of dry fuel for fires) and a change to controlled burning in suitable weather. Experiments in controlled burning occurred in the late 1950s.
The requirement for early fire detection in Queensland led to the construction of lookouts, lowset fire cabins, and cabins on towers, which would work alongside improved communications, firebreaks, fire huts with water tanks, and access roads for fire-fighting. The first official lookout station was at Observation Hill, at Good Night Scrub State Forest west of Bundaberg, in 1931. A high four-legged timber fire tower with a cabin and telephone was built in 1933-4 at Wongabel, the first of its kind in Queensland; and the first standard design timber ground cabin, Watalgan Fire Cabin No.4, was built in the Littabella Forest Reserve in 1935. Wongabel Fire Tower No.1 (demolished) was in the Barron State Forest. Watalgan Fire Cabin No.4 may no longer exist; in 2004 it was reported that it was last seen in 1997, and may have been destroyed by fire.
The first fire observation structure built in Barakula State Forest was Barakula Fire Tower No.1 (1938, demolished), which was a four-legged timber tower, high, with a forestry cottage nearby; and the lowset timber Turkey Mountain Fire Cabin No.6 was built in 1940 (since removed), about west-southwest of Waaje Fire Tower No.4. In 2006 the Turkey Mountain Fire Cabin was one of the oldest surviving fire observation structures in use in Queensland. The road up Turkey Mountain was built by Italian internees during World War II.
From 1930 to 2003, 129 timber or steel fire observation structures were built in Queensland, with 66 surviving by 2004. Although Queensland's fire towers were built as far north as the Atherton Tableland, most were located along the coast from Brisbane and Toowoomba north to Bundaberg; and in a north-south swathe to the west of Toowoomba.
The early fire towers were built with timber and were usually designed by the men who built them. Large timber poles (preferably grey ironbark, "Eucalyptus paniculata") were used for the legs (a single pole per leg, or poles spliced together for taller towers), which added stiffness and strength in high winds. Tall trees with a straight bole (trunk) and a minimal "pipe" of dead wood in the centre were used in fire tower construction. They were dressed by removing the branch stubs and straightened by trimming the outside of any bend with a broadaxe.
Originally, the poles were set directly into the ground but later they were bolted to steel brackets set in concrete footings, as first occurred in 1941 at Beerburrum. The towers were generally sited where there was dense, high quality and fire-susceptible timber worth protecting and they required road access to near the centre of a forest or a high point. The height of the tower was determined by estimating the height of the mature trees it would need to see over. Initially, this involved sending someone up a radio mast with a camera.
One of the men who constructed Queensland's fire towers was Arthur Leis, who built 28 towers between 1957 and 1987, including Queensland's first three-legged timber tower, Mount Binga Fire Tower No.4 (1967, ) near Cooyar, and the three-legged timber Jimna Fire Tower No.10, Queensland's tallest fire tower (1977, pole length ). Leis designed the first three-legged tower after being that told the four-legged towers were getting too expensive to build. The triangular structure of three-legged towers provided more strength, with fewer components. The fire tower construction process followed by Leis included: forming a small clearing at the tower's site with a bulldozer; choosing anchor trees to guy (rope) the poles in an upright position until they were fastened in place; transporting the poles to the site to be dressed; bolting wales (horizontally fixed timbers) and braces (diagonally fixed) between pairs of legs, with this carpentry, as well as construction of the cabin, occurring on the ground; raising a "Sampson" pole, which was used to help haul up the other tower legs; and then adding the stairs and cabin. Presumably, for a four-legged tower, bracing would have been added between the two pairs of braced legs, after they were raised. Arthur Leis built 23 towers. Queensland's three-legged timber towers are believed to be unique in the world, although there are some internet references to three-legged "steel" fire towers in the United States.
Tower design has changed over the years. Internal stairs were used instead of ladders from . The earlier cabins were entered by a trap door in the floor but later external cabin decks were added (from 1958 at Mount Borumba in the locality of Lake Borumba) and doorways from these decks into the cabins soon became the sole point of entry (for example at Waaje Fire Tower No.4). Queensland's first steel fire tower (four-legged) was built in at Lemon Tree Hill near Cardwell in 1966 and the last (and tallest) four-legged timber tower, Yuleba Fire Tower No.1 (), was built at the Amoolee Departmental Purposes Reserve the same year. With the move to three-legged timber towers, spliced poles became the norm, rather than single-length poles. The last three-legged timber fire tower was built in 1987 at Wolvi.
The early detection of a wildfire was more important to successful firefighting than firebreaks and the sooner the location of a fire was accurately pinpointed, the better. The tower cabins were manned by fire spotters with two or more towers working in tandem to locate a fire. Each cabin contained a map table with a 1:50,000 scale map (centred on the tower and marked with 360 degrees) and some had photographed or painted panoramas around the internal walls under the windows naming visible landscape features. A fine wire ran from the centre of the map to the ceiling. When smoke was spotted, the observer could stand behind the table and align the wire with the base of the fire and read the compass bearing from the degrees written on the cabin walls. The distance to the fire was estimated based on known landmarks, the sighting was added to the tower log book and a radio or telephone was used to communicate with other towers or the forestry base. Once a second tower took a bearing on the fire, its exact location could be confirmed by triangulation and fire fighters and equipment could be dispatched to the correct spot.
The increased demand for timber during and after World War II meant the Queensland Government pursued a reforestation policy after the war. Declining extraction of native hoop pine and bunya pine from the early 1940s was replaced with plantation pine, native cypress pine and hardwoods. State Forests provided 68% of Queensland's cut timber during the war, and 94% of all pine. Fire tower construction also continued, to protect the new plantations, and a bad fire season in 1957 boosted fire detection efforts. In 1963 Barakula Fire Tower No.2 (four-legged timber, , demolished) was constructed in the Barakula State Forest.
In 1964 Waaje Fire Tower No.4 was erected in the Waaje logging area of Barakula State Forest, on a section of the Great Dividing Range with a view over the surrounding forest. The tower could be staffed after lightning storms or during high fire danger periods. A "Type G" four-legged timber fire tower, Waaje Fire Tower No.4 had: four single-length poles fixed to steel straps set in concrete footings; eight braced sections; internal parallel stairs with landings and handrails; and external deck access to the cabin, which had wide eaves. Built by Arthur Leis, with a pole height of about , it was the first Queensland fire tower to exceed in height and to have sole access into the cabin from the external deck rather than via a trapdoor in the cabin floor. Its total height, including cabin, is estimated at . The project was also the first and only time that Forestry used a rigging firm, and a series of photographs, dated May 1964, recorded the construction. A scenic montage of the viewed landscape, up to away, was reportedly painted around the ceiling wall to indicate notable features, compass bearings and distance (not extant in 2017).
Another fire tower was soon opened in Barakula State Forest. In 1970 the Minister for Lands, Vic Sullivan, opened Coondarra Fire Tower No.5 (three-legged timber, high, also built by Arthur Leis) about west-southwest of Waaje Fire Tower No.4. The two towers worked in conjunction to pinpoint fires. In 2017, the cabin and part of the structure of Coondarra Fire Tower No.5 was in the process of being moved to the Chinchilla Historical Museum in Villiers Street, Chinchilla.
Despite the existence of fire towers, errors could still be made in fire detection. During the 1965-1966 financial year, a fire in the Waaje logging area caused $6,500 worth of damage and "thick dust haze caused experienced lookout observers to over-estimate grossly [sic] the distance of this fire, and it was not fought until it was quite large after ground reconnaissance established its location". 
Other towers related to fire-fighting were built in the Barakula State Forest but these were steel and did not include cabins: Mount George Fire Tower No.7 (four-legged steel tank stand tower, ), and Wongongera Fire Tower No.8 (four-legged steel tank stand tower, ) were built in 1968 and 1982 respectively. By 2003, there were also fire huts and tanks in the O'Donnell, Fairyland and Hurdle logging areas.
By 1980, when Queensland had 3,715,823ha of State Forest, the Dalby Forestry District contained 974,700ha (next biggest area was in the Rockhampton District, with 685,740ha). In 1989, the Forestry Department was amalgamated into the Department of Primary Industries (called the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in 2017), becoming the Queensland Forest Service and in 1995 the commercial and forest management functions of the Department were separated into the Resource Management Business Group and the Forestry Group. The Forest Service's activities in plantations, native forests and quarries were fully commercialised under the new Forestry Group. By the late 1990s, the Department of Primary Industry Forestry was responsible for commercial operations on 4.7 million hectares of Queensland's publicly owned forest estate, including 180,000ha of plantations.
In the late 1990s, a Comprehensive Regional Assessment of forests in the southeast Queensland bioregion was undertaken as part of a joint Australian and Queensland effort to form a Regional Forest Agreement (to balance conservation and sustainable use). A heritage inventory of infrastructure on forestry land, which occurred as part of this process, was later extended to the Southern Brigalow Belt bioregion in 1998-99. A joint Department of Primary Industries (DPI Forestry) and Environmental Protection Agency (Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service) project in early 2003 attempted to identify and assess the heritage values of Forestry infrastructure on Queensland Government land in the Brigalow Belt bioregion.
A Fire Observation Structures Heritage Project assessed the heritage values of all fire observation structures in Queensland, short-listing the most significant. In 2004, six fire observation structures were recommended for consideration for nomination to the Queensland Heritage Register. These included: Danbulla Fire Tower No.2 (1968, four-legged steel, ); Mount Allan Fire Tower No.5 (1954, four-legged timber, ); Yuleba Fire Tower No.1; Turkey Mountain Fire Cabin No.6; Cordalba Fire Tree Lookout (batten laddering added to a tree in 1935); and the Jimna Fire Tower No.10. In 2003 the oldest then-operational fire tower in Queensland was Bringalily Fire Tower No.3 (1948, four-legged timber, ), but this was only judged as being of regional heritage significance due to its isolated location and uncertain future use. Mount Binga Fire Tower No.4, possibly the world's first three-legged timber fire tower, was also not recommended for nomination to the Queensland Heritage Register, as the Jimna Fire Tower already represented the three-legged type in the Queensland Heritage Register.
In 2016, Turkey Mountain Fire Cabin No.6 was moved to the Chinchilla Historical Museum. In 2017, the restored Mount Allan Fire Tower No.5 is open to public access as part of the Conondale Range Great Walk while the cabin and part of the structure of Yuleba Fire Tower No.1 has been moved the Maranoa Regional Council's depot in Yuleba, prior to development a tourist attraction. The heritage-listed three-legged Jimna Fire Tower No.10 was declared structurally unsound in 2004.
Waaje Fire Tower No.4 was not included in the 2004 list of recommended places, although it was noted as being "in excellent order, in use and well maintained" when it was inspected in 2001. It has since been closed and the first flight of stairs has been removed to prevent access. With the removal of the Yuleba tower, the Waaje tower is now the tallest remaining four-legged timber fire tower in Queensland, and therefore the tallest tower using single-length timber poles. It is also the only intact example of a 1960s four-legged timber tower (all 1960s four-legged timber towers other than Yuleba and Waaje have been demolished). The demolished 1960s four-legged timber fire towers were: Brooyar Fire Tower No.11, Cooloolabin Fire Tower No.9, Eena Fire Tower No.2, and Sunday Creek Fire Tower No.4, all built in 1965. High Tower Fire Tower No.2 (1967) consisted of an extension to the existing four-legged timber 1934 East Nanango Fire Tower No.2 (since demolished).
Of the 65 timber four-legged fire towers built in Queensland from 1933 to 1966, 17 survived in 2004, and six of these, including Waaje Fire Tower No.4, are still in-situ in 2017..The other five four-legged fire towers to survive in 2017 are: Mount Allen Fire Tower No.5 (, 1954, open for access by hikers), Mount Fort William Fire Tower No.1 (, 1956), Corio Fire Tower No.2 (, 1957), Tuan West Fire Tower No.6 (, 1958, on the Fraser Coast Regioinal Heritage Register), and Cooke's Knob Fire Tower No.9 (, 1959). Of the 12 three-legged timber towers constructed from 1967 to 1987, eight survived in-situ in 2017. The towers have been rendered obsolete, as there has been a shift to using remote camera surveillance, mounted on steel structures, since 2002. This is due to the difficulty in sourcing new timber poles and the lower operational cost of unstaffed towers. In 2002, the first surveillance camera system was installed in Bribie Island Fire Tower. Images are relayed to a forestry office, and the operator can pan and zoom the camera, with the bearing of a fire shown on the camera display.
In 2017, the Barakula State Forest continues to produce cypress pine and the disused Waaje Fire Tower No.4 is the only surviving in-situ timber fire tower of the four built in the forest. Although the Barakula State Forest is currently owned by the Queensland Department of National Parks, Sport and Racing, the tower is the property of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.
Description.
Waaje Fire Tower No.4 is located in Barakula State Forest, which covers 283,500ha. Set on top of a hill in a small clearing about above sea level in the Great Dividing Range with a view over the surrounding forest, the tower is about by road north-northwest of Chinchilla.
A "Type G" four-legged timber fire tower, Waaje Fire Tower No.4 has four single-length grey ironbark (Eucalyptus paniculata) circular poles fixed with through bolts to steel straps set in concrete pad footings. The four concrete footings are about square in plan and the height from the top of the footings to the top of the cabin deck is around with an overall height of approximately . The poles, set about apart at the base, lean inwards towards the top of the tower.
There are eight braced sections to the tower above an unbraced bottom section. The eight braced sections each have rectangular-cut timber diagonal braces bolted across the outside of each face of the tower between the rectangular-cut timber horizontal bracing of each section. There is no diagonal bracing between the legs within the structure.
Nine flights of timber internal parallel stairs with timber handrails and small cantilevered timber landings on the outside of the poles at the end of each flight originally allowed access up the tower on the north side. The lowest flight of stairs has been removed to prevent access to the tower. The top flight of stairs passes through a rectangular hole cut in the cabin's external deck, which is supported by a system of bearers and joists fixed to the main tower. The deck is surrounded by timber guardrails and metal diamond wire mesh. There is a small radio antenna mast fixed to the northwest corner post of the deck.
The cabin, which has a hipped, corrugated metal-clad roof with wide eaves, gutters and downpipe, is estimated to be , with an internal ceiling height of , and has glass louvre windows on all four sides above half-height timber walls. A doorway from the external deck into the cabin is set in the north corner of the east wall. The interior of the cabin could not be inspected in 2017 but drone footage shows a map table in the centre of the cabin and compass bearings painted around the internal walls under the windows. Most timber is in good condition, apart from the stairs, the cabin's external decking floor boards and the guard rails.
Heritage listing.
Waaje Fire Tower No.4 was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 January 2018 having satisfied the following criteria.
The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.
The timber industry has played a vital role in the economic development of Queensland. Waaje Fire Tower No.4 (1964) is important in demonstrating the evolution of the management of timber resources by the Queensland Government, through the use of staffed fire observation structures to protect valuable stands of timber in State Forests from wildfires; and the associated evolution of timber fire tower design between the 1930s and the 1960s.
The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.
As the tallest, surviving, intact four-legged timber fire tower in Queensland, Waaje Fire Tower No.4, with single length poles, represents the culmination of the evolution of four-legged timber fire tower design and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a timber fire tower. Sited on high ground, with expansive views over dense stands of forestry timber, Waaje Fire Tower No.4 retains: four single-pole grey ironbark (Eucalyptus paniculata) timber legs, fixed to steel straps set in concrete footings; eight braced sections; internal parallel stairs with landings and handrails; radio antenna mast: and external deck access to a cabin with wide eaves. Internally, the cabin retains its map table and compass bearings painted on the walls.

For one year, the case did not end and the culprits are not found by the local police. This led to frustration among the public and the case is transferred to the Crime Branch. Pressurized, the crime branch police decided to fix Ajayan as the culprit to solve the case. They created suitable evidences to fix Ajayan as the murderer. 
Ajayan accepted the crime because of the torture that he had experienced by the police. While in remand, a convict asks him to appeal to the judge to fix a lawyer for him on his side. The court points Hanna (Nimisha Sajayan) as the legal aid for Ajayan. Initially, she hesitates to take the case, but after unraveling the truth behind the case, she shows real interest in it.

Furner Conservation Park

Furner Conservation Park is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Furner about south-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about north west of the municipal seat of Millicent.
The conservation park occupies land in section 245 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Kennion. It was constituted as a conservation park under the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972" on 22 November 1973. As of 2016, it covered an area of .
In 1980, the conservation park's listing on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate argued it to be significant because it was a “relatively undisturbed remnant of open forest and woodland representing the vegetation associations of both consolidated dune and interdunal flat” and “features a picturesque understorey of some diversity which provides much needed habitat for a typical south-east South Australian forest fauna.”
In 1990, the conservation park was described as consisting of "a gently undulating sandy rise with bleached sands and a yellow-grey B horizon" with "secondary landforms are parallel stony rises with exposed calcarenite, and red, weakly-structured sandy soils and low-lying sandy flats." The vegetation cover was described as consisting of three main associations. The first was "an open woodland of messmate stringybark… on the sandy rise with a similar but denser formation on most of the sandy flats." The second was "a woodland of river red gum… and rough barked manna gum" with some "areas of swamp gum… on the flats mainly in the eastern part of the conservation park near the watercourse known as Reedy Creek. The third was "a pink gum… open woodland with isolated drooping sheoaks … on the stony rises."
In 1990, the conservation park was "mainly used by field naturalist" and it was considered to have "potential" for use as an educational resource by the Kangaroo Inn Area School located about to the north-west in the locality of Kangaroo Inn.
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area.

Glaceau Smartwater

Glaceau Smartwater (stylized smartwater) is a brand of bottled water owned by Energy Brands. Introduced in 1996 in the United States, by 2016 it was one of the top five brands of bottled water in that country with sales worth nearly $830 million in 2017. 
The brand is also available in other countries including the United Kingdom, France, India, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, The United Arab Emirates, Croatia, Singapore, Serbia, Romania, Malaysia and Canada.
Product.
Smartwater is manufactured by distillation. This process removes most inorganic impurities, such as naturally dissolved minerals, but may let low boiling-point organic matter through. Afterwards, certain mineral electrolytes such as potassium, calcium and magnesium are added back. There are no known benefits of distilling potable water combined with the readdition of ingredients lost in this process.
Pack and variants.
In India, Smartwater is available in a 750ml PET bottle priced at Rs. 50. 
While globally, the brand has several variants introduced in 2017, such as Glaceau Smartwater Sparkling Green Apple, Lemon, and Berry &amp; Kiwi. In 2020, four new combination flavors were introduced: Cucumber Lime, Strawberry Blackberry, Pineapple Kiwi, and Watermelon Mint.
Marketing and sponsorship.
Since 2008, American actress Jennifer Aniston has been the ambassador for the brand globally and has been involved in a number of campaigns as the face of the product. She has been succeeded by Israeli actress Gal Gadot. 
The packaging featured an image of a goldfish; earlier packagings featured an otter.
Smartwater was launched in India through its association with TED Talks India Nayi Soch as the official sponsor for property.
Criticism.
In 2018, Smartwater was awarded the German "Goldener Windbeutel" ("Golden Cream-Puff") anti-award by the consumer rights advocacy group Foodwatch Germany for "the most brazen lie in food advertising" that year. The group said that Smartwater is "nothing but ordinary water" sold by advertising a "scientifically-sounding but completely unnecessary production process" which yields no proven nutritional benefits, for as much as seven times the price of regular water. The product also won the Dutch "Gouden Windei" ("Golden Windbag") prize that year.
The Coca-Cola Company repudiated the criticism and said that it followed all applicable food labeling regulations in a transparent manner, that Foodwatch had nominated Coca-Cola in order to attract attention to itself, and that "the success of the water with consumers proved that they liked the product for the taste."

Breviary of San Michele della Chiusa

The Breviary of San Michele della Chiusa is a manuscript liturgical book of 1315 in two volumes: the "Santorale" and the "Temporale" for a total of 1390 pages.
History.
It has been used for at least three centuries in the cycle of daily prayer at the Monastery of Sacra di San Michele.
After the dispersion of the library of the Sacra di San Michele, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the breviary was regained on the market by a wealthy donor who gave it to the Parish of San Giovanni Vincenzo in Sant'Ambrogio di Torino, which has been responsible for its conservation ever since.
Studies and insights.
In the last quarter of the twentieth century several scholars deepened specific studies on the Breviary of St. Michael, and in particular the works conducted by Costanza Segre Montel, Giacomo Baroffio and Gian Mario Pasquino who resumed the entire Latin text translating it into Italian and studying the Gregorian melodies. In 1995 the results of these works were published in the volume: "Il Millennio Composito di San Michele della Chiusa".
In 1999, through a co-funded project, the breviary was digitized and proposed for dissemination through a multimedia support.
The choir: "Coro Abbazia di Novalesa" began at the same time to study and sing the sacred melodies of the Breviary, spreading them to the public in numerous concerts over the years, and in the summer of 2015, on the occasion of the 700th anniversary released a music CD with 22 selected tracks of the Breviary of San Michele della Chiusa.
In the year 2015 the 700th anniversary of the Breviary was celebrated, promoted by a special commission established at the parish of San Giovanni Vincenzo in Sant'Ambrogio di Torino, which was a further opportunity to study and deepen the two texts of the Breviary and of the publications that have been written on the subject over time.
A public exhibition for the 700th anniversary was held in June, July and September 2015, and on 14 November 2015 a study conference with European experts presented the latest studies on the Breviary of San Michele della Chiusa. 
At the conclusion of this cycle of events on 21 November 2015, the day of the liturgical feast of San Giovanni Vincenzo, the "Coro Abbazia di Novalesa" held at the Church of San Giovanni Vincenzo in Sant'Ambrogio di Torino the official 700th anniversary concert, with a vast repertoire of Gregorian pieces taken from the two volumes of the Breviary.

Ralph Corsel

Ralph Corsel (died 2000) was an Italian-American novelist whose work dramatized the experience of Italian immigrants in New York City. 
Biography.
Ralph "Corseli" Corsel was born Raffaelo Corsalini to Neapolitan immigrants in Morris Avenue's "Little Italy" section of the South Bronx. 
Corsel had a troubled childhood, coming of age during the Great Depression. By the age of nine he had become a petty thief, and was sent to juvenile reformatory as a teenager. He went on to become "a gun moll's boyfriend who worked in a bootlegging plant, and a Depression-era hobo and panhandler who trekked cross-country to California, where he tried to become a professional singer and became instead a pickpocket and confidence man." He served in the Army during World War II, and worked as a bartender before establishing his own business as a manufacturer's agent. 
After a decade of owning his own business, he was able to step back from the day-to-day operations and pursue his dream of writing. Corsel's formal education had ended in the eight grade, and yet he enrolled in writing courses at Columbia University's School of General Studies. A teacher there encouraged him to turn his stories into a novel, which became his debut "Up There the Stars" (1968) published by The Citadel Press. The novel details Corsel's "colorful youth" and has been described as a classic "hardboiled novel of Great Depression-era life in the Bronx." Alberto Traldi, in a review of Italian-American fiction, describes "Up There The Stars" as "a touching novel with a refreshing hint of self-rehabilitation and with accurate information about crime and its psychological, social conditioning." 
Following the publication of his debut, Corsel went on from to write columns for Italian-American publications including the "Italo-American Times" and "The Challenge".
He teamed up with the famous boxer Rocky Graziano to write "Somebody Down Here Likes Me, Too," based on the boxer's turbulent and violent life story. The book's title is after Graziano's 1955 autobiography, "Somebody Up There Likes Me," which was the basis of the 1956 Oscar-winning drama film of the same name.
At its publication, The New York Times wrote:
Corsel was twice married.
Corsel died on September 17, 2000. He was survived by his daughter Candy and his grandchildren Elise and Paul.

<doc id="56655770" url="?curid=56655770" title="Cistercian Hymnal">
Cistercian Hymnal

The Cistercian Hymnal is a compilation of the ancient texts and melodies sung by Cistercian monks and nuns during the Liturgy of the Hours. This collection of hymns influenced the Cistercian Order's identity, since early abbots emphasized the compositions' musical quality. The hymnal developed in the course of the centuries.
Origins.
The first Cistercian Hymnal is dated approximately 1108, under the abbacy of Stephen Harding. He sent monks from his Abbey in Burgundy to Milan in order to copy the hymnal kept there. It was considered to be Saint Ambrose’s original, and Ambrosian hymns enjoyed great prestige in the Rule of St. Benedict since they were purported to have been in use at Milan since the 4th Century. The Cistercians, working from what they found in Milan, compiled a hymnal of 34 texts on 19 different melodies and used this for about twenty years. At the end of the 1130s, after Stephen Harding’s death, the General Chapter entrusted Bernard of Clairvaux with the revision of the hymnal (and other parts of the Office) because they considered the first version to be repetitive, and the Ambrosian melodies grated on their Burgundian sensibilities.
Revision under Bernard of Clairvaux.
Respecting Abbot Stephen’s solemn warning and knowing that the Benedictine Rule mentions the "Ambrosianum" four times (for vigil RB 9:4, lauds RB 12:4/13:11 and vespers RB 17:8), Bernard included the major hymns from Milan. But for the small hours of terce, sext and none, the Rule uses the word "hymnus"; on this basis they added 21 non-Milanese texts to the hymnal for use at terce and compline. That made it possible to again sing the great classics such as Vexilla regis for Holy Week, Conditor alme siderum in Advent, or Quem terra pontus for the Marian feasts. Consciously following the same principles as the first generation, they kept the 34 primitive hymns, except for a few textual variants made for the sake of orthodoxy. For a greater variety of texts, they chose to use the principle of division, commonly practiced at the time: The hymn is sung in full at vespers, half is taken at vigil and the other at lauds.
The melodies, on the other hand, were treated with less respect: most were modified, six simply eliminated, while others, mostly traditional, were added. Chrysogonus Waddell identifies seven new melodies, the last four of which are Cistercian creations: "Optatis votis omnium", "Almi prophet" (used today for "Aurea lucis"), "O quam glorifica", "Deus tuorum militum", "Mysterium ecclesiae", "Iesu nostra redemptio" and "Iam Christus astra", all very expressive and of great emotional intensity. They ended up with a set of 55 texts for 37 melodies, which were faithfully passed down up to the Council of Trent, with some additions to mark new liturgical feasts: the solemnities of the Blessed Sacrament, Saint Bernard, the Visitation; the feasts of St. Anne, St. Joseph, and the Guardian Angels.
Post-Tridentine Revisions.
In 1656, following the demands of the Council of Trent, Abbot General Claude Vaussin published the "Breviarium cistercium iuxta ritum romanum": except the "Veni Creator", all the festive hymns of Terce and Compline were moved to the Major Hours. Otherwise, all the melodies of the hymnal were retained, and some texts written by Cistercians appear in the Office: for example the hymns composed at that time for the Feast of All Saints of the Order, or the poem "Iesu dulcis memoria", written by an English Cistercian of the Twelfth century for the feast of the Holy Name of Jesus. The Ambrosian roots largely disappeared; after centuries of habit, the Cistercians were eager to preserve their textual versions of the hymns, even when scholarly research showed that the Cistercian texts did not always correspond with the Ambrosian originals. or even different hymns for the special liturgical times. And whereas the modern Roman breviary had different hymns for every liturgical hour of every day, the Cistercians wanted to keep a single feria hymn for the entire week at vigil, another hymn for the entire week at lauds, and another at vespers. The only variation for them was between the seasons of winter and summer.
After the Second Vatican Council.
During the twentieth century, the liturgical renewal granted, among other things, a prominent place to the Ambrosian hymns in the Roman Breviary of 1974: for example, "Veni Redemptor gentium", "Iam surgit hora tertia", "Hic est dies verus Dei". The concerns of the Council for textual criticism, historical truth, theological renewal, variety in the choice of texts, prompted the writers of Liturgia Horarum to revise the everyday texts or replace them with new texts, especially for saints' feast days.
Cistercian communities have since been trying, according to their different sympathies, to achieve a harmonious synthesis between the preservation of Cistercian heritage and an adaptation to the needs of our time and the liturgy of the universal Church.

Joseph Ndwaniye

Joseph Ndwaniye (born 1962 Murambi) is a Rwandan nurse and writer. He garnered widespread attention with the publication of his first novel, "La promesse faite à ma soeur", which won multiple awards.
Medical career.
Ndwaniye worked in several hospitals in Rwanda as a medical assistant before moving to Belgium over 30 years ago where he qualified as a specialist cancer nurse, trained in laboratory technologies and completed a Masters in Hospital Management. Since 2001, he has worked at the Cliniques universiatires Saint-Luc in Brussels in a unit for child and adult patients receiving bone marrow transplants and hematopoietic stem cell treatment. 
Literary works.
His first novel, "La promesse faite à ma soeur", published in 2007 by Impressions Nouvelles, was a finalist in the Prix des Cinq Continents de la Francophonie and the prix du Marais and the Prix Jean Bernard. This novel is the fruit of the author's own return to Rwanda several years after the genocide. "La promesse faite à ma soeur" tells the story of Jean who returns to Rwanda to find his family, visit his twin brother in prison and look for answers to a multitude of questions. The story's protagonist was noted as having a past similar to Ndwaniye, with the text being described as "autofictional" and "implicitly autobiographical". Ndwaniye denies that the book is an autobiography, but does state that it features autobiographical elements, adding "I don't know any novelist who doesn't write about himself".
In 2012, his second novel, "Le muzungu mangeur d'hommes", was published by Aden. In this novel, a young, idealistic Dutch couple moves to Rwanda. The young woman takes over as Chief Medical Officer in a regional hospital, whilst her husband spends his time exploring the region, learning kinyarwandan and discovering the local customs and culture. They face the realities of the country around them and each discover happiness in their own way. 
"Plus fort que la hyène", published by La Cheminante, is his first young adult novel. It is the result of his desire to create a link between his career as a nurse and his passion for literature, which, along with music, offers hope in the most difficult medical and personal contexts..
He contributed a short story to "Nouvelles de Rwanda" (2019) published by Magellan &amp; Cie Editions.
He is currently finishing his next novel which is set in Bolivia.

Monster Prom

Monster Prom is a dating simulation game developed by Beautiful Glitch, a studio based in Barcelona and founded by Julián Quijano, and published by Those Awesome Guys. The game was released for Windows, macOS and Linux on 27 April 2018 and was distributed on Steam. A Nintendo Switch release was launched on 21 May 2020. "Monster Prom" was written by Julián Quijano, Cory O’Brien and Maggie Herskowitz, illustrated by Arthur Tien, and programmed by Elías Pereiras. Players assume the role of a student at Spooky High, a high school populated by monsters, as they attempt to find a date to prom.
An expansion to the game, titled "Monster Prom: Second Term", was released on 14 February 2019.
Gameplay.
"Monster Prom" is a 2D narrative dating sim that features both a singleplayer mode as well as a multiplayer competitive mode of up to four players. The player assumes the role of one of four pre-set characters, all of whom students at Spooky High, and can choose between six different monsters they can try to date. Players can play as any gender and pronouns with the game allowing for straight, gay, and lesbian dating options.
The game randomizes the story every time it is played. Each turn, players must decide how they will spend their time over the course of six weeks leading up to prom, going through various events in one of several map locations at Spooky High in order to gain stats that affect the way their love interest perceives them. Throughout the game, players will be presented with various choices which may affect their relationship with other characters, as well as which events and endings they experience. The players’ actions will decide whether their love interest agrees to take them to prom or not. It features multiple endings, mini-games, and limited voice acting. The game also includes a shop where players can purchase items that can trigger new events as well as special endings.
The "Second Term" expansion included additional content such as new endings and two newly-dateable characters.
Plot.
The players are presented as students within Spooky High, a high school in a world inhabited by monsters. They are given a time limit of three weeks in order to convince their chosen love interest to take them to prom. The game's plot changes with each new playthrough, giving players a unique sequence of events, dialogue and endings, depending on their choices. The four player characters are Oz, the personification of fear; Amira Rashid, a fire djinn; Brian Yu, a zombie; and Vicky Schmidt, a Frankenstein's monster, although the names and pronouns of the characters can be changed before playing. The six monsters available to romance are Scott Howl, a werewolf; Liam de Lioncourt, a vampire; Vera Oberlin, a gorgon; Damien LaVey, a fire demon; Polly Geist, a ghost; and Miranda Vanderbilt, a mermaid. "Second Term" introduces two new monsters to romance: Zoe, an Eldritch monster; and Calculester Hewlett-Packard, a computer robot.
The majority of the game's humor is very Western-influenced, consisting of many pop culture references, banter-based dialogue, self-referential commentary on monster fiction, and light satirical themes. The game has over 1,300 possible events and 47 secret endings.
Development.
On 25 November 2016 the game successfully completed a Kickstarter campaign raising funds through 1,592 backers. The campaign raised just over €32,000, quadruple the intended goal of €8,000. The additional funding allowed for more content such as endings, items, and characters. A roster of notable voice actors was assembled to portray the cast, including Arin Hanson, Dan Avidan, Nathan Sharp, Cristina Valenzuela, Sarah Anne Williams, Christine Marie Cabanos, Danielle McRae, Erika Ishii and others. On 14 February 2018 the developers announced the game's release via a teaser trailer, and the game was released on 27 April 2018 on Steam for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. The "Second Term" expansion DLC, which was a stretch goal of the Kickstarter campaign, was released on 14 February 2019, adding additional voice work from Felicia Day, Casey Mongillo, Jacksepticeye, Ross O'Donovan, and Brizzy. Language support for Simplified Chinese was added on 23 January 2020.
On 27 April 2020, to celebrate the 2nd Anniversary of the game's initial release, Beautiful Glitch announced "Monster Prom: XXL", which consists of the original game, the "Second Term" DLC, as well as all seasonal content released throughout the game's lifespan. It was released on the Nintendo Switch on 21 May 2020 and on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One thereafter on 14 October 2020.
Sequel.
On May 8, 2019, Beautiful Glitch announced a sequel titled "Monster Prom 2: Holiday Season" and launched another Kickstarter campaign with a playable demo. The sequel will feature the same characters from "Monster Prom" in three minigames: "Summer Camp", a dating simulation similar to the original game; "Winter Retreat", a strategy game featuring Vera and Miranda; and "Roadtrip", an adventure survival game featuring Scott and Polly. The campaign proved successful and raised over €535,000 from almost 9,000 backers within a month, surpassing their goal of €32,000. The sequel is currently in development, and "Monster Prom 2: Monster Camp" has been released on October 23, 2020.
Thanks to the extra funding on Kickstarter, additional content was announced in the form of a future DLC titled "Monster Prom: Not another isekai!" and an additional sequel titled "Monster Prom: REVERSE", in which the playable characters from the first game can be romanced.
Reception.
The PC version of the game received a score of 73 on the review aggregator Metacritic, indicating "mixed or average reviews", while the Nintendo Switch version received a score of 81, indicating "generally favorable reviews". The game was mainly praised for its writing, humor and character art. Jeff Ramos and Allegra Frank of "Polygon" praised "how genuinely funny "Monster Prom" is. Considering almost every line in the game is a punchline, it’s an achievement that the humor never felt labored or forced." Many critics also praised the game's multiplayer mode, many of whom declared it stronger than the singleplayer version. Tony Cocking of "Twinfinite" notes that the game "fares better as a multiplayer game than a single-player one" as it "can grow repetitive, particularly when played alone." Rebekah Valentine of "App Trigger" had a more favorable view of both game modes, stating that the game "rests on a framework of superb character art and hilarious scenario writing, then goes several steps further to offer a challenging competitive experience and an addictive solo one."
Publications also praised the amount of content the game offers, with Alyse Stanley of "Rock, Paper, Shotgun" stating that "its combinations of events and endings make every playthrough feel like it’s your first time." Stan Yeung of "Gaming Age" adds that "the sheer amount of events and possible outcomes meant it would be hard for me to get bored." However, some critics noted that despite the game's strengths, its mechanics often stagnated which made it difficult to find much in the way of replayability. "CD-Action" states that the "hilarious, brilliant dialogues are not enough to compensate for random, grind-oriented gameplay." Similarly, in a mixed review, Eugene Sax of "Game Critics" notes that "despite the wealth of options, the scenarios become predictable and tired quickly."
Regarding the Nintendo Switch version, Neal Ronaghan of "Nintendo World Report" had a favorable review and wrote that while "not a game for everyone... "Monster Prom" is a riotously good time" thanks to its humor and ability to "take a visual novel and dating sim and transforms it into a party game".
Accolades.
The game was nominated for the "Matthew Crump Cultural Innovation Award" and for "Most Fulfilling Community-Funded Game" at the SXSW Gaming Awards.

Gilan Mausoleum

Gilan mausoleum () is a monument located on the slope of a hill in Ordubad district of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in the territory of Kharabagilan habitation. The mausoleum was discovered accidentally by the local population in 1979. The top tower of the tomb is destroyed, but the tomb is in satisfactory condition.
Architectural features.
The plan of the tomb is octagonal internally, and rectangular externally. Inside of the monument there is a low pavement that does not fit with the environment
of the interior. The tomb of the Gilan mausoleum differs from the octagonal tombs of medieval architecture that are spread in Azerbaijan and neighboring countries. Center of cover of the Gilan mausoleum is supported by mushroom-shaped - expanding upward column in center of the interior. The column is also octagonal in the plan.
General composition of Gilan mausoleum is in a style with the XII century mausoleums of Central Azerbaijan, especially the Red Dome mausoleum. The Gilan mausoleum was built of layers of broken rock fragments from surrounding rocks. Unlike its interior, exterior of the monument is neatly built. In the interior the ceiling and floors are completely, as well as spaces between stones of the wall and central support are plastered with white solution. Dark gray stone cuttings and roughness creates natural decorative order. Expression of the interior of the tomb is based on the pure volume structure of the shapes.
Outside, on the upper layer of tomb a cubicle body was raised. The top tower was completely built of brick and decorated with geometric ornaments made from bricks. The corner of the body were covered with cylindrical brick columns. The bottom part of one of these columns remains. In decoration of the monument, blue glazed bricks were used as well.
Research.
There is no evidence of the time of the mausoleum construction. However, according to the architectural features mentioned above, it is possible to predict the period of the tomb of Gilan for architectural patterns and geometric patterns.
The architectural style of the Gilan mausoleum is in same line with the architectural style of the churches built in the XII century in Central Azerbaijan. Gilan mausoleum can be dated back to the XII century as a result of absence of inscription.

The Only Juan is a live album by drummer Jerry Granelli and keyboardist Jamie Saft which was recorded in Southport, Connecticut and released on the Love Slave label in 2002. 
Reception.
In his review for Allmusic, David R. Adler notes that "Drummer/percussionist Jerry Granelli and organist/pianist Jamie Saft team up on this quirky and fairly chaotic set of duets. ... The two principals cover a lot of ground, from blistering groove and noise to extreme minimalism to faux cocktail music and '70s folk ... Even when they cross the line into kitsch, Granelli and Saft bring a unique perspective to live interaction and sound production".

A Great Space Voyage

A Great Space Voyage () is a Soviet 1975 children's science fiction adventure film directed by Valentin Selivanov based on Sergey Mikhalkov's play "The First Three, or the Year of 2001 ..." (1970). The film premiered in the USSR on November 5, 1975.
Plot.
Three teenagers — Sveta Ishenova from Bukhara, Sasha Ivanenko from Donetsk and Muscovite Fedya Druzhinin — win the All-Union Children's Space Competition and after completing the special training course, go to the first ever children's flight on the Astra spacecraft. During the flight the only adult on the ship, Captain Egor Kalinovsky, gets sick and is placed in the isolation ward.
A series of short-term emergencies that arise shortly after this force the child astronauts to make independent decisions in conditions when erroneous actions threaten to destroy the crew and the ship.
With the honor of withstanding all the tests, the film's characters suddenly discover that the Astra is an underground simulator, and the expedition of the "first three", which has never really left Earth, is a psychological experiment designed to find out the prospects of a real children's space flight. At the same time it turns out that Fedya, who accidentally learned about the real mission of the Astra shortly before the start, hid it from Sveta and Sasha, with the objective of preventing failure of the important experiment.
Despite the fact that the "great space voyage" turns out to be just a training session, all three of its participants, who at the given time find a way out of the simulator and get to the surface at the main entrance to the Flight Control Center, are met as real space heroes.
Production.
The film was shot over a period of approximately two years.
Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov served as technical advisor and as casting director. He also had a cameo role in the picture.
The film's soundtrack by beginning composer Alexey Rybnikov proved to be quite popular — it received significant airplay in the Soviet Union.

Multi-Modal Logistics Parks in India

Multi-Modal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) is a key policy initiative of the Government of India, led by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), to develop Multi-Modal Logistics Parks in hub-and-spoke model to improve the country's freight logistics sector by lowering overall freight costs and time, cutting warehousing costs, reducing vehicular pollution and congestion, improving the tracking and traceability of consignments through infrastructural, procedural, and information technology interventions.
Since, in 2017, India had comparatively high logistics costs, 13% of total price of goods compared with 8% in other major economies and average 72% higher cost than China of exporting/importing a container in India. To make India globally competitive by reducing these costs and time, the MoRTH is developing multi-modal logistics parks at selected locations in the country under its Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Program (LEEP).
MMLP is officially defined as a freight-handling facility with a minimum area of 100 acres (40.5 hectares), with various modes of transport access, mechanized warehouses, specialized storage solutions such as cold storage, facilities for mechanized material handling and inter-modal transfer container terminals, and bulk and break-bulk cargo terminals. Logistics parks will also provide value-added services such as customs clearance with bonded storage yards, quarantine zones, testing facilities, and warehousing management services. Provisions will also be made for late-stage manufacturing activities such as kitting and final assembly, grading, sorting, labelling and packaging activities, re-working, and returns management.
As of July 2021, 35 MMLP has bene identified by MoRTH. Among those Bangalore, Chennai, Guwahati and Nagpur are under implementation, and rest are in pre-planning and DPR is yet to be prepared.
Background.
Expansion of logistics sector with India's economic growth.
Keeping pace with India's rapid economic growth is the expansion of the country's logistics sector. The movement of freight in the country nearly doubled to around 2,300 billion ton-kilometers in fiscal year 2015 from 1,200 billion ton-kilometers in fiscal year 2008. The government expects freight movement in the country to continue its growth trajectory, with expected annual growth of 8%–10% over the next 10 years. The logistics sector as a whole, according to a study commissioned by MoRTH, is poised to expand at roughly 1.2 times the rate of India's gross domestic product growth through 2032, by which time it is expected to generate $360 billion in value added, up from $115 billion in 2017.
India's Logistics Performance Index score.
In 2016, India managed to improve its performance in the Logistics Performance Index (LPI), a ranking published by the World Bank to measure the logistics performance of countries. India's LPI ranking rose to 35th in 2016, up from 46th in 2012. India's ranking, however, still lags behind some of its economic peers, including other Asian countries. The best logistics performer in Asia is Singapore, which was ranked 5th in 2016, followed by Hong Kong, China (9th); Japan (12th); the Republic of Korea (24th); and the People's Republic of China (PRC) (27th). Among the grouping of so-called BRICS—comprising Brazil, Russia, India, the PRC, and South Africa—aside from the PRC, South Africa also outperformed India in 2016 with a ranking of 20th (World Bank, 2016).
Government's MMLP initiative.
Drivers and challenges for logistics sector development in India.
Logistics costs are high in India relative to costs in developed countries, which were 13% of GDP in 2015 compared to approximately 8%–10% in developed nations. India's road freight cost per ton-kilometer, adjusted for purchasing power parity, is ₹1.90 ($0.03), which is almost double that of the United States. These higher logistics costs in India are primarily driven by the following five key factors. 
Government's policy and reforms initiatives.
To overcome the challenges to the development of logistics sector, government took several initiatives. In addition to nationwide imposition of a goods and services tax (GST), Make in India, infrastructure improvement projects, the Government of India is undertaking reforms and technology adoption to transform India's integrated logistics sector which includes the following:
Five key functions of MMLP.
The development of MMLPs is envisaged as a key policy measure to reduce logistics costs and help address three of the five constraining issues identified above. Specifically, these include an unfavorable modal mix, inefficient fleet mix, and underdeveloped material handling infrastructure. In July 2017, the Government of India approved a plan to build 35 MMLPs. State governments will provide the land needed for the projects, which will then be taken up through public–private partnerships.
MMLPs have 5 key functions: 
List of MMLPs by states.
In 2017, the Government of India launched a program to develop 35 multi-modal logistics parks across the country over the succeeding years and invited Asian Development Bank (ADB) to become a lead partner and provide the necessary support (Jeong, 2017). ADB then conducted a pre-feasibility study to assess the suitability of MMLP locations and identify the requisite infrastructure, connectivity, and regulatory reforms in two selected locations: Bengaluru in Karnataka and Guwahati in Assam.
MoRTH has planned to develop 35 MMLPs under Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer (DBFOT) mode. Based on the detailed project report (DPR), feasibility study and approved bidding document, the tender will be invited from companies. The bidding documents (The Model Concession Agreement and Request for Proposal) is being finalised for these 35 MMLPs, following cities have been selected. Each will have a minimum area of 100 acres (40.5 hectares). The following MMLP have been identified:

Admiralty Arch, Holyhead

Admiralty Arch, in Holyhead, Anglesey, was built in 1824 to mark the end of Thomas Telford's Holyhead road. The arch was designed by Thomas Harrison and its main purpose was to commemorate the visit of King George IV of the United Kingdom in August 1821. The King arrived in Holyhead on the royal yacht "Royal George" on the 7 August, continuing to Plas Newydd where he stopped overnight. He returned the next day to his yacht, but due to poor weather his departure was delayed and the decision was made to transfer to the steam packet "Lightning" which conveyed him on the 12 August to Howth, near Dublin for his state visit to Ireland. The change to the packet boat was met with widespread approval.
Funded through public subscription the structure took two years to complete and was made of stone quarried at Red Wharf Bay on the eastern side of Anglesey. Due to its history it is known alternatively as the George IV Arch by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales or the Triumphal Arch.
The Grade II* listed arch is situated within the Port of Holyhead on Ynys Halen and cannot be accessed by the public due to safety reasons. In 2017, plans to move it to a more open location were mooted. At present the best place from which to view it is from St Cybi's Churchyard.
At the seaward end of the Admiralty Pier, beyond the arch, is the Grade II listed Holyhead Mail Pier Lighthouse, completed in 1821 it was designed by John Rennie as part of extensive improvements to Holyhead Harbour.

Calectasia Conservation Park

Calectasia Conservation Park, formerly the Calectasia National Parks Reserve, is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Wattle Range about south-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about west of the town of Penola.
The conservation park occupies land in section 157 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Short on the southern side of the Robe - Penola Road. The land first acquired protected area status as the "Calectasia National Parks Reserve" proclaimed on 7 September 1967 under the "National Parks Act 1966". On 27 April 1972, it was renamed as the "Calectasia Conservation Park" upon the proclamation of the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972" which repealed the former act along with other statutes concerned with conservation. As of 2016, it covered an area of .
In 1980, the statement of significance provided for the now-defunct Register of the National Estate states that it “preserves a population of the blue tinsel lily… now rare in South Australia and a small seasonal swamp important for water birds and eastern swamp rats.”
In 1990, the conservation park was described as consisting of a ‘’stranded dune system” remnant divided into two areas by a low-lying area which accounts for about 70% of the conservation park's area and which is “subject to inundation during the wetter months of the year.” The area in the south supports a brown stringybark woodland with an understorey of Austral grass tree, the ‘low-lying area’ supports “a dense grassland of mainly introduced species” while the area in the north supports a “low woodland of brown stringybark with large scattered desert banksia… and a dense heath understorey.” The blue tinsel lily grows in the north east part of the conservation park where a protective enclosure has been erected around the main stand of the plant. Additional protection exists for the species in the form of a vermin proof fence to the perimeter of the conservation park.
The conservation park was within the part of the state that was burnt during the Ash Wednesday bushfires in February 1983.
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category IV protected area.

English Bread and Yeast Cookery

English Bread and Yeast Cookery is an English cookery book by Elizabeth David, first published in 1977. The work consists of a history of bread-making in England, improvements to the process developed in Europe, an examination of the ingredients used and recipes of different types of bread.
Background and writing history.
The food writer Elizabeth David had published six books and several booklets before 1977. Her first works had been about the foods of the Mediterranean, France and Italy, but she had also begun to write about English cuisine; her first book on the subject was the 1970 work "Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen".
"English Bread and Yeast Cookery" was David's second book on English food, which she spent five years researching and writing. Some of the research was undertaken with Jill Norman, her friend and publisher. She was angered by the standard of bread in Britain and wrote:
What is utterly dismaying is the mess our milling and baking concerns succeed in making with the dearly bought grain that goes into their grist. Quite simply it is wasted on a nation that cares so little about the quality of its bread that it has allowed itself to be mesmerized into buying the equivalent of eight and a quarter million large white factory-made loaves every day of the year.
In the book, David reproduced a newspaper cartoon published during a bakers' strike in 1974, showing one housewife telling another, "I've been giving them sliced bathroom sponge, and they haven't noticed yet."
Book.
The work covered the history of bread-making in England and an examination of each ingredient used. David follows the pattern of "Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen", devoting the first part of the book to history and the second to recipes. Reviewing the new book, the food writer Jane Grigson wrote "Mrs. David gives the history of wheat and milling … She goes into weights and cost from the establishment in 1266 of the Assize of Bread up to present-day regulations, with a separate chapter on costing your own bread vis-à-vis bought loaves."
In the second part, David devotes chapters to recipes for various forms of baking. Bread comes first, followed by recipes for, among many other things, buns, yeast cakes, soda-bread, brioches, croissants, "pain au chocolat" and pizza. As in her earlier books, the recipes are interspersed with excerpts from earlier authors, including Fernand Braudel, Auguste Escoffier, and the painter John Constable.
Contents.
The following list refers to the 1977 edition.
Release and reception.
In 1977 David was badly injured in a car accident—sustaining a fractured left elbow and right wrist, a damaged knee cap and a broken jaw—from which she took a long time to recover. "English Bread and Yeast Cookery" was published while she was in hospital. Its scholarship won high praise, and Jane Grigson, writing in "The Times Literary Supplement", suggested that a copy of the book should be given to every marrying couple.
In "The Observer", Hilary Spurling called the book "a scathing indictment of the British bread industry" and also "a history of virtually every development since Stone Age crops and querns". Spurling rejoiced in the range of David's recipes, and thought the book was done with "orderliness, authority, phenomenal scope and fastidious attention to detail". Roger Baker, reviewing in "The Times" wrote "This is probably Mrs. David's most academic work yet. However, not one ounce of the familiar charm, good sense, asperity (reserved for modern commercial white bread), clarity or warmth is missing."
Publishing history.
The book was published by Allen Lane in hardback and Penguin Books in paperback, with reprints in 1978 and 1979. The first American edition was published by Viking Press in 1980, and a rewritten American edition was published by Penguin in 1982. In 1995, Biscuit Books of Newton, Mass. published a new American edition. A new edition was published in London by Grub Street books in 2010.

Talking to Polish pop culture magazine "Luvpop" about the album's title, Anne-Marie said: "I just feel like that's what I did on the album. I'm not a shy person anyway, I speak my mind a lot and I am not... I don't hold anything in, I am honest with people and open. And I've just feel that's what I've been like on this album, so it kinda makes sense."
Singles.
"Alarm" was released as the lead single from "Speak Your Mind" on 20 May 2016. The single became Anne-Marie's first major worldwide hit, peaking at No. 16 on the UK Singles Chart. The single additionally reached the top 20 in as Australia and Scotland, as well as the top 40 in seven countries. It was certified Platinum in the UK, Australia, and Poland, and Gold in the US and Canada.

Marshmello keeps avoiding being asked to leave. However, as Anne-Marie attempts to kick him out, he keeps finding ways to get back into the house, which annoys Anne-Marie and her friends.
"2002" was released as the sixth single on 20 April 2018.

<doc id="56656177" url="?curid=56656177" title="María Clara doctrine">
María Clara doctrine

The María Clara doctrine, also known as the Woman's Honor doctrine, is a legal doctrine applied by Philippine courts regarding cases that concern abuse against women. The doctrine is a presumption "that women, especially Filipinos, would not admit that they have been abused unless that abuse had actually happened."
Etymology.
The doctrine was named after María Clara from José Rizal's novel "Noli Me Tángere". Clara is characterized as reserved and shy and was later considered an "ideal" role model for women in Filipino culture, although such notion was imposed by Spanish colonizers. This contrasted the ideal of women being more assertive, independent and courageous which dates back to the precolonial era.
Legal history.
The doctrine became a part of the Supreme Court of the Philippines' jurisprudence some time in 1960 following the "People v. Taño" case. The high court through Justice Alejo Labrador asserted a "well known fact" that women, especially Filipinos "would not admit that they have been abused unless that abuse had actually happened." The court said that women's natural instinct is to protect their honor. The case involved three armed robbers who the court found liable for taking turns in raping a woman.
About 58 years later since the doctrine entered the high court's jurisprudence, the Third Division of the Supreme Court reversed a ruling on January 17, 2018 by a Davao court on two people convicted of rape. The 2018 decision was released in late February. The case involved an alleged rape that happened in 2009 and the two accused were sentenced of "reclusión perpetua", or forty years of imprisonment, in 2012. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in 2016.
The court described the doctrine as causing a "travesty of justice" by putting the accused at an "unfair disadvantage", criticizing the doctrine for assuming that no Filipina woman of "decent repute" would falsely claim that she was abused. It urged for the acceptance of the "realities of a woman’s dynamic role" in Philippine society today so one can "evaluate the testimony of a private complainant of rape without gender bias or cultural misconception". It also stated that the discrepancies in the alleged victim's testimonies had cast doubt on whether the rape incident did or did not happen.
This led to concerns and speculations that the high court has abandoned the doctrine. The Gabriela Women's Party condemned the decision which it viewed made the Maria Clara doctrine invalid saying the ruling reversal will empower rapists and disagreed with the court's assessment of the societal status of women.
On February 21, 2018, Supreme Court's spokesperson, Theodore Te has clarified that the doctrine had not been abandoned, explaining that the high court can abandon a doctrine only during a full session.

The Prairie (film)

The Prairie is a 1947 American western film based on the novel "The Prairie" by James Fenimore Cooper.
Production.
The film was made by a new company, a co-operative venture between director Frank Wisbar, production manager Edward Finney and writer Arthur St Claire. The financed, cast and made the picture themselves. Reportedly Wisbar raised some finance from his family back in Germany.
It was shot at a new studios, the Motion Picture Center, over 12 days at an estimated $10,000 a day.
"This is an interesting, a desperate, attempt to break the deadlock on independent production", said Wisbar. "The other boys and I made up our minds to finance, cast and film a picture as well as it could be done, without interference from the "front office", distributors, or anyone else. We did this knowing a low budget can be – and usually is – the ruin of a good picture. I know. I've made them; bad ones."
Wisbar said they picked Cooper's novel because it was in the public domain and also "because it keeps the rootin', tootin', and shootin' to a minimum and stresses the human element, the story of a man who was a law unto himself. We wrote our script straight, cutting out every scene that was not absolutely necessary."
Wisbar said the film was made in a style that was "realistic but stylised. Camera treatment is modern in what I would call highly poetic."
The film marked the acting debut for Robert Mitchum's brother John.
Reception.
The "Los Angeles Times" said "I wish I could say the film makes some claim on artistry."
Associated Producers Inc announced a new version of the book would be filmed on 2 March 1959 but it appears to have not been made.

Agra catbellae

Agra catbellae is a species of carabid beetle named after the actress Catherine Bell. The holotype was collected in Costa Rica and first described to science in 2002.
Etymology.
Terry L. Erwin, who described the species, explained that the binomial nomenclature is catbellae because it is the "combined name of the actress starring on the then-current TV program "JAG", Catherine Bell. These beetles share the forest with an elegant cat, the Jaguar".
Other species in the genus "Agra" named by Erwin include Agra liv, named after Liv Tyler, and Agra schwarzeneggeri, named after Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Ilubirin Estate

Ilubirin Estate is a public foreshore housing project being built on reclaimed land in Ikoyi Island, Lagos at the foot of the Third Mainland Bridge, facing the Lagos Lagoon waterfront on Lagos Island 
Overview.
The housing project was initiated by Lagos State Government in partnership with First Investment Property Company through a Public Private Partnership (PPP). The initial design proposal was approved by the Lagos State Ministry of Housing through the Lagos Home Ownership and Mortgage Scheme (LAGOSHOMS). The first phase of Ilubirin was scheduled to be completed in 2019.
Ilubirin was initially modelled after Ikoyi Foreshore Estate, Ikoyi, Lagos and has now been remodelled from a purely residential into a mixed-use development of residential, commercial and leisure areas.
The residential block prototypes that will be completed in the phases are a mixture of 126m2 of 2 bedroom flats; 183m2 of 3 bedroom flats and 76m2 of 1 bedroom flats. 
The project site area is approximately 15.1 hectares. Ilubirin aims to combine the benefits of affordable housing with mid-market luxury.
However, the Lagos State Government was criticized for evicting some of the local residents who lived in proximity to the construction site.

Sriwhana Spong

Sriwhana Spong (born 1979) is an artist and dancer from New Zealand.
Spong grew up in Auckland, New Zealand, in a family of Balinese origin. She studied at Elam School of Fine Arts, graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 2001. Her first exhibitions were in not-for-profit spaces in New Zealand, Australia and Germany. In 2003 she had her first solo show, at the Anna Miles Gallery.
Spong also holds a master's degree from Piet Zwart Institute in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Much of her work is in film and video, and reflects her training in classical ballet by focusing on dance and movement. In 2010 she presented a multi-dimensional film at Art Basel, a re-imagining of a lost ballet, George Balanchine’s "The Song of the Nightingale". The ballet was originally choreographed in 1925 however all that remains are fragments of a film of it, the score, and photographs of the costumes. Spong also published a companion book to her film.
Women mystics.
Spong's practice has been partly influenced by the works of medieval women mystics, which she first encountered while at Piet Zwart Institute in 2014. In an interview with Ocula in 2018, Spong mentioned the Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector, the Christian mystics Margery Kempe and Hildegard von Bingen, among others, as her inspirations. For Spong, who considers "art history' as largely the history of male looking—and predominantly white male looking", women mystics' writings led her to examine "the idea of breaking and entering the practice of a much-lauded male modernist painter and stealing a work, only to remake it into something of my own".
Recognition.
In 2005 Spong's work "Nightfall" won the Contemporary Art Award at Waikato Museum. In 2012 her work "Fanta Silver and Song" was shortlisted for the Walters Prize.

There Is No Escape

There is No Escape, also known as The Dark Road and The Thurston Story, is a 1948 British drama film from Hammer Films.
It was Michael Ripper's first appearance in a Hammer Film.
The film was based on the career of criminal Stanley Thurston, who appeared in the cast as a character based on himself. Thurston was famous for his numerous escapes from prison, 5 times in 15 years. He was released from prison in October 1946.
The film had trouble with the British censors who thought the film glamorised a real life criminal. Thurston had to be billed as "Charles Stuart."
James Carreras said, "The picture already has official police approval. I
have done everything to show that crime is a mug's game. Thurston is the only non-professional actor in the film. All he asked was £10 a week to cover expenses. At the end of the film he turns to the audience and tells them that a criminal life just isn't worth the candle, especially when guns are brought into crime. He made such a good job of the picture that I had him listed for a racing story on his merits as an actor. That plan will now have to be shelved."
The film was shot at Marylebone Studios.

List of vaginal tumors

Vaginal tumors are neoplasms (tumors) found in the vagina. They can be benign or malignant. A neoplasm is an abnormal growth of tissue that usually forms a tissue mass.
Vaginal neoplasms may be solid, cystic or of mixed type.
Vaginal cancers arise from vaginal tissue, with vaginal sarcomas develop from bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels or other connective or supportive tissue. Tumors in the vagina may also be metastases (malignant tissue that has spread to the vagina from other parts of the body).
 Cancer that has spread from the colon, bladder, and stomach is far more common than cancer that originates in the vagina itself. Some benign tumors may later progress to become malignant tumors, such as vaginal cancers.
Some neoplastic growths of the vagina are sufficiently rare as to be only described in case studies.
Signs and symptoms may include a feeling of pressure, painful intercourse or bleeding. Most vaginal tumors are located during a pelvic exam. Ultrasonography, CT and MRI imaging is used to establish the location and presence or absence of fluid in a tumor. Biopsy provides a more definitive diagnosis.
Other animals.
Vaginal tumors also can be found in domesticated animals:

It provides a public transport connection to Hannover Airport. It has been operated exclusively by the Hanover S-Bahn since its opening on 28 May 2000.
Route.
Shortly after Langenhagen Pferdemarkt station, the line branches to the west off the Hanover–Buchholz railway, which runs to the north at this point. It then runs almost directly to the west, crossing the A 352. Shortly before Hannover Airport station, the line enters a cutting, which bends to the southwest and the line runs into the underground station.
The S-Bahn station is a terminal station and the only station on the line. The station has two platform tracks, which join in the tunnel area to form one track, although the station access ramp is wide enough for the laying of a second track.
Signalling on the line is operated by the computer-based interlocking in Langenhagen, which is controlled by a dispatcher in "Betriebszentrale Nord" (Operations Centre North) in Hanover.
Operations.
Normally, the line is served by S5 services to Hamelin and Paderborn. During large fairs on the Hanover Fairground, S8 services also run to Hannover Messe/Laatzen station.

Louis-Sextius de Jarente de La Bruyère

Louis-Sextius de Jarente de La Bruyère (Marseille, 30 September 1706 – Meung-sur-Loire, 29 January 1788) was a French prelate born in 1706. He was Bishop of Digne in 1747, Bishop of Orléans in 1757, and made commander in the Order of the Holy Spirit in 1762.
Biography.
Early life.
Born into a family of old Provençal nobility, Louis-Sextius de Jarente de La Bruyère was the son of Geoffroy-Alexandre de Jarente (b. 1670) and his wife Marie-Elisabeth de Lallier de La Tour (b. 1680).
Ecclesiastical career.
He was first canon of the Abbey of Saint-Victor de Marseille, where he knew the famous Belsunce, Bishop of Marseille.
Bishop of Digne in 1747, he was named abbot of Saint-Honorat de Lérins in 1752. He was made Bishop of Orleans in 1757 and commander of the Order of the Holy Spirit in 1762. The following year, he is named Abbot of Saint Vincent.
Well liked in court, he was appointed Minister of Profit Sheets and was responsible for distributing the revenues of the various abbeys, churches and their farmland from 1757 to 1771. During this period, 75 bishoprics and 337 abbeys are attributed, which alludes to the importance of this very coveted and lucrative position. The solicitors crowd around him.
On 8 July 1767, he attended with his colleague Louis-André de Grimaldi, Bishop of Mans, the blessing of enthronement of Venture-Gabrielle de Pontevès de Maubousquet, the new abbess of the Abbey of Maubuisson, by the Bishop of Marseilles, Jean-Baptiste de Belloy.
Finding church life mundane, he frequented salons earning a good living. "Jarente was the victim of numerous pamphlets accusing him of having had for his mistress Guimard". Thus, at the end of the 1770s, Mlle. Guimard, who was in need of money, had the idea - which may have been suggested to him - to open an "income bureau", offering to forward Jarente requests from clergy for salary increases, these claims with varying bribes depending on the size of the claim.
Louis XVI, informed of the scheme, became angry and reprimanded Bishop Jarente. Being close with the Duke of Choiseul, he was dismissed in 1771 and retired to his Château de Meung-sur-Loire, residence of the Bishops of Orleans that he had sumptuously redecorated.
He ordered the reconstruction of the Orleans Cathedral.
In 1780, he had his nephew, Louis de Jarente de Senas d'Orgeval, appointed as coadjutor.

Siege of Eastern Ghouta

The siege of Eastern Ghouta was a siege that was laid by Syrian Government forces in April 2013, to the area in eastern Ghouta held by anti-government forces since November 2012, during the Syrian civil war. The cities and villages under siege were Douma, Mesraba, Arbin, Hamouria, Saqba, Modira, Eftreis, Jisrin, as well as suburbs of Damascus Beit Sawa, Harasta, Zamalka, Ein Tarma, Hizzah and Kafr Batna. By 2016, around 400,000 people were trapped in an area just over 100 square kilometres in size, thus with a population density around 4,000 inhabitants/km2.
United Nations Security Council Resolution 2401, adopted on 28 February 2018, called for a nationwide ceasefire in Syria for 30 days, including Eastern Ghouta, but the Syrian Army continued the offensive. In March 2018, the Syrian Army split the enclave into three parts, reaching an agreement with the rebels to withdraw to the north, to Idlib. This action displaced 105,000 people from the area. Douma was the only city left by the end of that month that was not under Syrian government control.
On 8 April 2018, an agreement had been reached to evacuate remaining fighters and civilians from the last rebel-controlled pocket of Douma after an alleged chemical weapons attack that reportedly killed 70 people. The Syrian Government denied responsibility, together with its ally involved in the war, Russia. More than 50,000 people, including fighters from the Jaish al-Islam and their families, have been evacuated out of the city as part of the deal, to northern Syria. Around 200 hostages loyal to the Syrian Government have reportedly been released by the rebels. Russian military police were deployed to Douma to enforce the agreement.
Thousands of people were killed during this 5-year siege period. Numerous war crimes allegations were made during the siege, among others from the United Nations Human Rights Council, including the use of prohibited weapons, attacks on civilians, attacks against protected objects (schools, hospitals), starvation as a method of warfare and denial of medical evacuation.
Background.
Prior to the Syrian civil war, the total population of Eastern Ghouta, a collection of farms and cities near Damascus, was around 1.5 million people. During the civil unrest that began in Syria in March 2011, some of the eastern Ghouta residents took part in the protests against the Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad and joined the Syrian rebels and expelled Syrian government forces by November 2012. In February 2013, Syrian rebels captured parts of the ring road on the edge of Damascus and entered the Jobar district of the capital city. Backed by Iran and Hezbollah, the Syrian Arab Army counterattacked and in April 2013 began a siege of Eastern Ghouta, which is just 15 km or a half hour's drive outside the capital Damascus. Cut off from the rest of the country, the population of Eastern Ghouta resorted to incineration of plastics to generate electricity. In early 2015, when the Syrian government cut off water supplies to Duma, the population adapted yet again and dug over 600 underground wells, using manual pumps to supply water.
History.
In mid-2017, the main rebel faction in the area was Jaysh al-Islam, based in Douma (with an estimated 10–15,000 fighters in the region in early 2018). The second largest was Faylaq al-Rahman, an official affiliate of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), controlling much of central and western parts of Ghouta, including the Jobar and Ain Terma districts. Ahrar al-Sham (based in Harasta) and Tahrir al-Sham (HTS – controlling smaller districts such as Arbin, al-Ashari and Beit Nayim, with an estimated strength in the area of 500 in February 2018) had a far smaller presence.
In August 2013, the area was subjected to a chemical attack that killed hundreds of people, after which an agreement was made to ban chemical weapons in Syria. From 14 to 30 November 2017, the Russian-Syrian forces conducted more than 400 airstrikes in the area, hitting markets, schools and houses, and during some of those airstrikes allegedly using banned cluster munition.
Despite efforts at turning Ghouta into a de-escalation zone, reports of bombs allegedly containing weaponised chlorine were registered again in early 2018. By January 2018, the area had only a single doctor per 3,600 people. Inter-rebel fighting in 2016 and once again in 2017 deteriorated the situation even further, showing a lack of unity among the rebel groups.
After a series of offensive operations launched by Syrian rebels against positions of the Syrian Arab Army in Harasta, a northeastern suburb of Damascus, and other locations in Ghouta, the Syrian Arab Army launched an operation to capture the rebel-held part of Ghouta in February 2018. The escalation of hostilities led to a United Nations Security Council meeting held on 24 February 2018, voting unanimously in favor of a 30-day cease-fire in Syria, and demanded immediate lifting of the siege of eastern Ghouta. In March 2018 the government offensive continued, being supported by the Russia both diplomatically and militarily. On 11 March, the Syrian government took control over several areas and split the enclave into three pockets. These pockets included Duma and its northeastern outskirts, eastern Harasta, and Zamalka and surrounding area.
In mid-late March after a series of negotiations, a deal was finally reached between the Syrian government and rebels that controlled parts of Eastern Ghouta. The deal involved a transfer of remaining rebel fighters from the areas of eastern Harasta, Zamalka and surrounding areas to the province of Idlib. 105,000 people were displaced by this evacuation from the area. By the end of March, Douma was the last pocket controlled by the rebels, the Jaish al-Islam fighters.
For at least 10 days, there were minimal attacks on the rebel pocket of Douma as talks with the Jaish al-Islam continued. It was reported later that the Jaish al-Islam shelled residential areas in Damascus, causing casualties and material damage. By 6 April, talks had "faltered" between the two sides and the SAA renewed their offensive in response to the attack. The Jaish al-Islam denied responsibility. The rebel group had also reportedly refused to release detainees loyal to the Syrian government it was holding in Douma. The shelling on 8 April 2018, which left several civilians dead, drew allegations of chemical weapons use in Douma, though the UN could not verify the claim initially.
Casualties.
In February 2018, the Syrian Network for Human Rights, a UK-based non-governmental organization, founded in June 2011, published a report alleging that 12,783 civilians were killed in and around Eastern Ghouta from March 2011 to February 2018, including 1,463 children and 1,127 women.
According to local hospital sources, which were cited in the French newspaper "Le Monde", approximately 18,000 people were killed in the enclave by October 2017.
Médecins Sans Frontières claimed that 70 percent of the enclave's population lived underground by November 2017 to escape bombardments. It also registered that, on average, 71 people were being killed daily since the 18 February 2018 offensive. It registered 1,005 people killed and 4,829 wounded in two weeks alone, between 18 February and 3 March 2018.
War crimes allegations.
Government and allies.
Numerous war crimes allegations were made during the battle, including the use of prohibited weapons, attacks on civilians, attacks against protected objects (schools, hospitals), starvation as a method of warfare and denial of medical evacuation. The siege by the Syrian government left the enclave under a humanitarian crisis, leading to famine and a lack of food. According to a 2014 United Nations report, the denial of food as a military strategy began during July and August 2013: Eastern Ghouta's crops and farms were shelled and burned. The report also alleged that Syrian forces "blocked access roads and systematically confiscated food, fuel and medicine at checkpoints". Some inhabitants had to rely on tree leaves as an alternative for vegetables to survive. The rebels established a web of tunnels to smuggle supplies, but they were destroyed by the government forces.
UNICEF Representatives said that at least 12% of children under 5 were acutely malnourished in the enclave in early 2018. On 27 October 2017, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, warned that "the deliberate starvation of civilians as a method of warfare constitutes a clear violation of international humanitarian law" and called for access of humanitarian workers to deliver aid to the people of Eastern Ghouta. The Syrian government restricted humanitarian aid to the enclave. On 30 October 2017, supplies were allowed to only 40,000 residents in the two cities of Kafr Batna and Saqba. One U.N. aid convoy arrived to Eastern Ghouta in February 2018, only after it had no access for 78 days.
The Syrian government also used chemical weapons against the armed groups in Eastern Ghouta in July 2017, specifically in Ein Tarma (1 July), Zamalka (2 July) and Jobar (6 July), and on Harasta on 18 November 2017. The agents included chlorine gas and organophosphorous pesticide. The Syrian government also used internationally banned incendiary weapons. In one such incident reported on 16 March 2018, at 11:48am, these weapons were dropped on Kafr Batna, killing at least 61 and wounding over 200 people.
In December 2017, satellite imagery analysis by UN experts concluded that 3,853 buildings were destroyed, 5,141 severely damaged and 3,547 moderately damaged in the western parts of the enclave. The suburb of Jobar was 93% destroyed, Ein Tarma 73%, and Zamalka 59%. Hospitals in Eastern Ghouta were reported to have been shelled: Syrian army forces destroyed a field hospital in Al-Zemaniyah during a ground operation in July 2013, while shells landed near Al-Fatih hospital, where victims of the chemical attack were treated, forcing it to discharge its patients. Between 4 and 21 February 2018, the Syrian-Russian bombardments killed 346 people in Eastern Ghouta. Local counts reported 700 deaths in the three months up to mid-February 2018, many of them civilians. On 7 December 2017, the United Nations Senior Advisor Jan Egeland called east Ghouta the "epicenter of suffering".
After the end of the siege, tens of thousands of people have been unlawfully interned by the Syrian Government forces in rural Damascus, including Ghouta. Amnesty International has called the "unlawful siege and unlawful killing of civilians, including the use of internationally banned cluster munitions" by the Syrian government and Russia a war crime and a crime against humanity.
Rebel groups.
The United Nations also found the four largest rebel factions that were active in eastern Ghouta, namely Jaysh al-Islam, the Al-Rahman Legion, Ahrar al-Sham, and Tahrir al-Sham, guilty of crimes against humanity. They were known to arrest and torture members of religious minority groups, and regularly fired mortars and rockets from eastern Ghouta at government-held areas. These attacks aimed at spreading terror, and killed many civilians.
Reactions.
United Nations.
2013: After the alleged chemical weapons attack in the Ghouta area of Damascus, the UN sent an inspection team to begin an investigation. The final report concluded that evidence suggests that "surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used in Ein Tarma, Moadamiyah and Zamalka". The Russian government dismissed the initial UN report after it was released, calling it "one-sided" and "distorted".
2018: After the start of the renewed SAA offensive called "Rif Dimashq offensive" during mid-February, the UN proposed a 30-day ceasefire aimed at allowing aid deliveries to enter besieged areas, as well as medical evacuations. This ceasefire was "ignored" as the SAA continued its advances into the rebel-controlled areas. It was reported that in the following month, some 25 food trucks were allowed in. Some argued that this was simply not enough for the people living in war-torn areas.
USA, France, UK.
The governments of the United States, United Kingdom and France accused the Syrian government of a chemical attack against the population of Douma on April 2018. As a consequence, the three states conducted a series of airstrikes targeting sites associated with Syria's chemical weapons capabilities in Damascus and Homs on 14 April 2018. The next day, Russia tried to pass a resolution condemning these US-UK-French airstrikes, but it was not adopted by the U.N. Security Council.

Thomas Higham

Thomas Higham is an archaeological scientist and radiocarbon dating specialist. He is Professor of Archaeological Science at the University of Oxford, UK, best known for his work in dating the Neanderthal extinction and the arrival of modern humans in Europe.
Early life and education.
Higham grew up in Dunedin, New Zealand, the eldest of four children of Polly and Charles Higham; his father is an archaeologist specialising in the prehistory of southeast Asia. He studied Archaeology at the University of Otago, receiving a BA Honours degree in 1988 and a master's degree in 1990. Higham became interested in radiocarbon dating and moved to the University of Waikato where, in 1993, obtained a doctorate degree.
Career and research.
Higham worked as the Deputy Director of the radiocarbon dating laboratory at Waikato, before joining the Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art, at the University of Oxford in 2001. He is currently the Director of the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit (ORAU) and a Fellow of Keble College.
Higham's work focuses on the development and reliable application of radiocarbon dating in archaeology. His main interests lie in the refinement of the protocols used for the purification of ancient samples prior to radiocarbon dating. His early work focused on the peopling of New Zealand. Upon arrival in Oxford, Higham became involved in testing and improving the ultrafiltration method for dating archaeological bones.
In 2002, Higham met British archaeologist Roger Jacobi and the two worked closely together on the dating of several key Palaeolithic sites from the British Isles, until Jacobi's death in 2009. The most notable result of this work was the redating of the Red Lady of Paviland, an iconic early modern human from Britain. Later, Higham reported an age estimate for the Kents Cavern maxilla from Devon, England, the earliest modern human fossil in northwestern Europe.
Since 2006, Higham and his team at Oxford have worked on defining the timing of Neanderthal replacement by anatomically modern humans in western Eurasia and quantifying the overlap between the two human groups. In 2014, results of this work reported in Nature placed Neanderthal extinction at around 41000–39000 years ago, and suggested a Neanderthal-modern human overlap of 3000–5000 years in Europe. In 2013, funded by the European Research Council, Higham launched the "PalaeoChron" Project that focuses on the dating of late Neanderthals, early modern humans and Denisovans at hundreds of sites across northern Eurasia.
Higham has featured in CNN's series "Finding Jesus".
In 2018, Higham was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand.

Erich Erber

Erich Erber (born April 30, 1953) is an Austrian entrepreneur. He is the founder of Erber KG, later known as Biomin GmbH; the animal health and nutrition company specializes in feed additives and premixes. In 2020 Erich Erber sold Erber Group and founded SAN Group. It continues to be family-owned and operated.
Early life and education.
Erich Erber was born on April 30, 1953 in Sankt Pölten, the capital of the state of Lower Austria, and was raised on a small farm in the Mostviertel region.
He studied agriculture at the Francisco Josephinum Secondary College and Research Institute, obtaining the equivalent of a high school diploma in 1975.
From 1976-1978, Erich Erber worked as an Operations assistant at Kettaneh Pt Ltd, located in Accra, Ghana. He was involved in the production of construction materials. At the same time, he acquired expertise in the field of international trade while majoring in export sales at the Vienna University of Economics and Business from 1978-1980. Concurrently, he began to study macroeconomics at the University of Vienna (without obtaining a degree). From 1980 - 1982, he was the Head of Sales at Chemagrar, a subsidiary of Werfft Chemie, which specializes in feed additives for the Central European compound feed industry.
He received his MBA, with a focus on strategic marketing, from the University of Hull in Singapore.
Biomin.
In 1983, Erich Erber and Margarete Erber founded Biomin GmbH together in Pottenbrunn, Lower Austria. The company's first products were developed in a former slaughterhouse.
It continues to be family-owned and operated.
Biomin GmbH acquired Interpremix, a company with its own tank mixer and the product Antitox Plus, in 1985. Following extensive research, the product was developed further under the name Mycofix and subsequently became a global benchmark product.
One year later, it was exported to Asia for the first time. In 1988, Biomin GmbH concluded a research agreement with the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. Its goal was to continue to improve Antitox Plus's effectiveness in deactivating a wide variety of mycotoxins.
Erber Group.
In 1992, Erich Erber founded Biomin's first subsidiary with a local partner in Kuala Lumpur. In later years, additional subsidiaries were created abroad: examples include the first Biomin production site in Vietnam in 1995 and regional headquarters which opened in Singapore and the U.S. in 1997. In 1996, Erber AG was also founded as an unlisted public company; it was a holding company for the two group members at the time as well as for all future organizations.
By creating an interdisciplinary in-house research team, Erich Erber established another forward-thinking milestone. Research and development have been part of Biomin's key cornerstones ever since.
The next step on his path to success took place when he acquired Romer Labs Missouri in 1999. In doing so, he was able to develop a business segment that was completely new: diagnostics in the field of feed and food safety. Romer Labs thus became the second division of Erber Group.
In 2004, Erich Erber created the Biomin World Nutrition Forum, with the goal of actively involving customers and promoting trust in the organization. Scientists, customers and managers come together to exchange ideas regarding current developments. 
It takes place once every two years, with approximately 800 participants (event organizers, keynote speakers, etc.).
In 2005, Mr. Erber took additional steps to ensure the group's development by opening the first Biomin Center of Applied Animal Nutrition.
Erber Group's third and fourth divisions joined in 2007:
Sanphar, a Brazilian company specializing in animal health, and EFB. EFB, together with the subsidiary Bio-ferm, focuses on innovative biotechnological pesticides and their research, international registration and marketing.
The construction of a state-of-the-art yeast fermentation facility in Brazil has been the group's largest investment thus far; it became operational in 2010. This site makes direct shipments to regional markets possible.
Erber Group sees itself as an organization of experts and is the global market leader in mycotoxin risk management, its original core business.
The high-performance research and development within the group provides a basis for the development of customer-oriented and innovative solutions. This is made possible, in particular, by cooperating with renowned universities and research centers on various projects.
Erber Group is now one of the global leaders in the field of food and feed safety. Headquartered in Getzersdorf, Lower Austria, it specializes in natural feed additives, feed and food analyses as well as plant protection. In the 2017 financial year, it generated sales revenues of over 325 million Euros. Erber Group consists of Biomin, Romer Labs, Sanphar and EFB. Including its sales partners, it is represented in over 120 countries. Erber Group's annual growth can be attributed to two important success factors: the group's international orientation and its internal research and development.
Today, Erich Erber is the main stockholder and chairman of the Erber AG advisory board. The Erber family owns all of the companies' stocks; they are not traded on any stock market.

Biathlon rifle

A Biathlon rifle is a specialized rifle designed for use in a biathlon event. Specialist biathlon rifles are ultra lightweight, and usually equipped with straight-pull actions, integrated magazine carriers, and ergonomic stock designs suitable for both prone and standing shooting positions.
Sanctioning bodies.
Biathlon rifles are usually built to comply with technical regulations of a competition sanctioning body. The most well known is the International Biathlon Union, which holds competitions in winter biathlon, which is part of the Winter Olympics, as well as summer biathlon events.
Other biathlon sanctioning bodies and their competitions include:
Technical.
Stock.
Biathlon stocks tend to be built for performance, and often have some unique ergonomic design features compared to traditional rifle stocks. One of these features is the shape of the pistol grip, which often has a distinct thumb rest, allowing the thumb of the firing hand to rest pointing upwards. This helps isolate the movement of the trigger finger from the movement of the thumb, which are known to have a tendency to move together as a form of sympathetic reflex. Biathlon stocks are often ergonomically shaped for both the prone and standing position, and often have a distinct raiser block for the standing position. To aid in prone shooting, a hand-stop is often attached to the stock, as well as pouches for carrying extra magazines and modules for carrying extra single rounds.
Carrying harness and sling.
The shooting sling is usually only attached to the forearm of the rifle, and has a hook which quickly can be attached to the athlete's arm before shooting and detached before skiing.
The carrying harness is usually attached both to the forearm and butt of the stock allowing the athlete to comfortably carry the rifle on the back. The carrying harness usually does not double as a shooting support. The carrying harness is designed to let the biathlete carry the rifle with minimal hindrance, and in such a way, increase performance in the ski track.
Equipment weight limit.
For IBU competitions, the total weight of the unloaded rifle has to be between . The current weight limit was established around the 1986 season after Glen Eberle had showed the world a new and lighter stock design. At that time olympic biathlon rifles usually weighed well over 5 kg, and it was a common belief that a rifle needed to be somewhat heavy in order to be stable enough to shoot accurately, particularly with the fast heart rate and shortness of breath experienced during a biathlon race. Another contribution to the relatively high weight was to make the stocks stronger, since biathlon stocks commonly were known to be at risk of breaking around the pistol grip area when the athlete fell. Eberle set out to make a stronger and lighter design, and received a research grant from the United States Olympic Committee. He consulted engineers, biomechanical experts and NASA scientists, and the work resulted in a design which combined wood of Sitka spruce and carbon fiber composite materials. This resulted in a biathlon stock that was 1.6 kg lighter than any on the market, a substantial weight saving on a 20 km biathlon race. In addition to being easier to carry while skiing, Eberle also felt he had demonstrated that an athlete with a lightweight, but well balanced and ergonomically correct rifle, would shoot better than with the conventional heavy rifles. The Eberle stock quickly became popular, with most athletes competing with either the Eberle stock or similar designs. After some initial resistance, the world biathlon governing body accepted the new low weight design, and used it as a standard for the current 3.5 kg limit.
It is not uncommon for athletes to add extra weights to the front of the barrel (i.e. 100 grams), thereby making for more steady aiming by moving the balance point of the rifle forward.
Action and trigger.
Straight pull and toggle actions are popular. In IBU competitions, conventional bolt actions are still used to some extent, but usually only as an affordable alternative for beginners. IBU rules require that the trigger pull weight must be at least . A manual safety is not required.
Fullbore bolt action rifles are typically used in moose biathlon and Nordic field biathlon competitions. Nordic field biathlon rules stipulate a minimum trigger pull of in the diopter classes, and in the scope classes.
During skiing, the bolt is normally kept closed to prevent snow from entering the action either due to precipitation or in case the athlete falls. Snow entering the action could cause issues with precision or with cycling the action, or in the worst case cause a safety issue.
Ammunition.
Smallbore biathlon rifles used today are usually chambered for the .22 LR (5.6×15 mmR) cartridge. Temperatures below can have a significant effect on the reliability and accuracy of most rimfire firearms and ammunition, and some manufacturers therefore certify their production rifles by recording group sizes at for example . Special purpose cold weather biathlon ammunition is also available, and the ammunition lot used should ideally also be cold-tested in the particular rifle to ensure that the combination of rifle and ammunition gives a good precision.
IBU competitions, such as in biathlon at the Winter Olympics, uses the .22 LR cartridge only. The .22 LR rimfire cartridge was standardized for IBU biathlon competitions in 1978. Current rules require that the muzzle velocity must not exceed 360 m/s, and the bullet must weigh between 2.55 and 2.75 grams. .22 LR is also the only approved cartridge in the Nordic field biathlon smallbore class. The .17 HMR cartridge is permitted in the moose biathlon smallbore class, and is predominant due to better ballistics at 100 meters.
In fullbore moose biathlon and Nordic field biathlon, 6.5×55 mm and .308 Winchester are the most common cartridges. Any cartridge up to 8×57mm is permitted in the scope class of Nordic field biathlon, however, the cartridge should be suitable for the targets and firing distances, which can be 1 mrad (3.4 moa) sized targets anywhere from 100 to 600 meters.
Sights.
The sights need to be rugged in order to keep the zero in case the competitor falls, and often have added protection to keep snow from entering the sight.
In IBU competitions, only non-magnified diopter rear and globe front sights are permitted. Most classes in Nordic field biathlon are also restricted to diopter sights. An eyecup (blinder) is often used instead of eye protection, but this is an optional feature. Globe front sight inserts used in IBU competitions usually have aperture openings between 2.8 and 3.4 mm. Most Russian rear sights are adjusted following the counterclockwise (CCW) convention, while German diopter sights often are adjusted clockwise (CW).
Scope sights are permitted in moose biathlon competitions, as well as in the scope class in Nordic field biathlon. In moose biathlon, the shooting is performed standing at a distance of 100 meters. Magnification of the scope sight can be chosen at the preference of the competitor. For example, scopes with variable magnification between 4-12 or 8-20 are common. Experienced competitors have a tendency to shoot with the scope set to a higher magnification than beginners. In Nordic ski field shooting, the firing distances can be the same as in Nordic field shooting, i.e. between 100 and 600 meters.
The amount of sight adjustment performed with one click varies with type of firearm. Competition air and smallbore rifles typically have finer sight adjustments. In fullbore biathlon, both optical and iron sights usually have 0.1 mrad (0.3 MOA) adjustments.
Barrel length.
In IBU, the competition rules does not specify the barrel length and total length of the firearm, and firearms designers have therefore optimized these parameters to achieve optimal and stable performance from the ammunition across different weather conditions. Barrel lengths are usually around , and the overall length is usually around . Many .22 LR barrels used in biathlon feature a choked (constricted) muzzle, presumably to achieve better performance in cold weather. Choked muzzles are also commonly seen in other high precision competition rifles, like in free rifle (ISSF 50 meter prone and three positions).
In moose biathlon, barrel length must be within the legal requirements for hunting moose. In the Nordic field biathlon diopter class, only three standard barrel lengths are approved (). No barrel length restrictions apply to the scope class in Nordic field biathlon.
Maintenance.
Maintenance of biathlon rifles in general follow the common principles of firearm maintenance. This includes checking that all screws are properly tightened (stock, action, sights, sling, carrying harness and accessories), inspecting the stock for cracks and lubricating all gliding parts.
After long use of .22 LR rifles, lead deposits can have a tendency to build up in the receiver, which can require more thorough cleaning once in a while to ensure continued precision and smooth operation without jams. A dirty action is seldom an issue on fullbore biathlon rifles, except for some self loading designs.
Some special considerations include if the biathlon rifle has been used in cold temperatures, in which case condensation may form on the cold surfaces of the firearm when it is taken inside. Wet weather may also cause moisture on the firearm. In such cases, it is common to dry and "acclimatize" the firearm in room temperature for a short while (i.e. an hour) before applying lubricant. The bolt and any snow covers should then be left open to help remove moisture.
During a competition, exchange of broken firearm to a spare one is only possible after inspection and with the permission of the Range Master.
Models.
Smallbore.
The current sport standard is the Anschütz 1827 Fortner, which is reported to be used by an estimated 97% of biathlon competitors worldwide.
The design dates back to 1984, when Peter Fortner was having beers with Peter Angerer from West Germany who recently had taken the individual biathlon gold at the 1984 Winter Olympics. Angerer expressed that he wanted a rifle which could match those used by Soviet and East German competitors. Fortner took the challenge and within a few months developed and patented what was to become known as the "Fortner action", with the 1827 Fortner introduced around 1984. The Fortner action is produced by Fortner Waffen under licence from Anschütz, and are marketed as Anschütz rifles.
The 1827F has a lock time around 1.7 milliseconds, giving a total time of around 4 milliseconds from activation of trigger to the bullet has exited the barrel. The straight pull mechanism uses 6 ball bearings to lock the bolt. The action has an external safety.
The main competitor to the Anschütz 1827F today is the 7-3 and 7-4 Series toggle rifles made by Russian Izhmash, and both mechanisms require only around a 2.5 kilogram-force to cycle, and can be cycled in under 1 second. However, with the Fortner straight pull action, the shooter closes the bolt using their thumb, allowing the index finger to get on the trigger blade faster. Anschütz Fortner rifles come with a two-stage trigger adjustable from . The straight pull mechanism uses six ball bearings to lock the bolt.
Other biathlon rifles formerly produced by Anschütz include the Anschütz 1427B Biathlon built on a Match 54 14XX action, the Anschütz 1827 (not to be confused with the 1827 Fortner) built on a Match 54 18XX action and the Anschütz 64R Biathlon built on a Match 64 action.
In 1970, Izhmash started producing the liqhtweight traditional bolt action Bi-4 rifle () in 5.6×15 mmR (.22 LR), which was produced until 1978. For a while, only traditional bolt action mechanisms were permitted, but this restriction was removed towards the end of the 1970s. In 1976, the Finns presented the first rimfire rifle with a toggle action called Finnbiathlon, allowing for faster reloading. Izhmash soon followed and presented their version of a rimfire toggle action later in 1976, a mechanism which is still used today on Izhmash sport, hunting and tactical rifles. In 1977, when international biathlon standardized the .22 LR caliber, Izhmash released Bi-6 bolt action rimfire rifle. When some of the restrictions on action types were lifted somewhere around 1980, Izhmash took the lead by introducing the Izhmash Bi-7 side-toggle rifle in 1979. The Bi-7 had a weight of 4.0 kg, had a 60 cm long barrel, 111 cm overall length and an sight radius between 81 and 83 cm. The trigger pull weight was adjustable between 200 and 1000 grams. Soviet athletes went to the Biathlon event at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid using Bi 7-2 straight pull rifles, and won most medals. The Bi 7-2 rifle set itself apart from the previous Bi 7 toggle series with the introduction of a new barrel locking system which allowed for an increased rate of fire. Across the 1980s, the design proved very successful with Soviet athletes taking the relay gold medales in three successive Olympics.
The Bi 7-2 () became the basis for the development of the next rifles in Izhmash Biathlon series, Bi 7-3 and 7-4, which was used in the 1990s by both Russian and foreign competitors, including Germans. The Soviet teams used Izhmash rifles exclusively until the early 1990s, when the difficult Russian economy had a profound effect on development and production at Izhmash. Some Russian athletes began using Austrian Anschütz rifles, and Izhmash also produced their Bi 7-4A rifles using Anschütz barrels. Updated Bi 7-4 rifles were still used at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Izhmash's production facilities have since been vastly modernized and improved, and today have inhouse production again of complete rifles. The mechanism is meant to be a simple, reliable and precise construction, and can be dry fired without risk of firing pin damage as long as magazine is not inserted. Bi 7-4 serial production rifles have been steadily refined across the years, with major upgrades in parts like the barrel, stock and sights. Some special versions have also been made. Models now come with two stage triggers adjustable from 300 to 2000 grams. Some examples of top international biathletes currently competing with Izhmash rifles are Evgeniy Garanichev, Yana Romanova, Ekaterina Glazyrina, Olga Vilukhina and Olga Podchufarova. After interest from the Norwegian Biathlon Association, the Bi 7-3 Cadet rifle has been developed to suit the needs of beginner biathletes. The stock is designed for athletes of the age 9 to 15 years, with an adjustable cheek rest and length of pull.
The 7-4 series is a pure competition rifle featuring a more complicated and fully adjustable trigger which can be dry fired, while today's 7-2 series comes with a non adjustable trigger and some design simplifications compared to the 7-4 (some early 7-2 models had a two-stage fully adjustable trigger). The 7-3 series is an in-between model which combines some features from the 7-2 and 7-4. Parts such as different triggers and toggle assemblies are not necessarily interchangeable across models. All modern Izhmash biathlon rifles feature an external safety.
A unique design is the Suhl 626 and 626-1 lever action developed in East Germany of which there only was around a couple of hundred produced, and the similar Krico 360SII later produced in the reunited Germany of which there only was around fifty made. The action is unique in that it is cycled by the rotating the pistol grip approximately 15 degrees. The rifle had a 54 cm barrel length, weighed about 4.2 kg and had a trigger pull around 500 grams. The stock was made of walnut, and was available in a black epoxy finish. The rifle was reportedly discontinued because the biathlon teams considered the price to be too high. One of the last times the rifle was used at an Olympic level was at the 2006 Winter Olympics by Sven Fischer where he took gold in the Men's sprint|Men's 7.5 km Sprint
Another model produced by Krico was the 360S "straight pull" (sometimes referred to as S1 or SI), which was mechanically equivalent to the Suhl 628 model. The Suhl 628 model has the same action type like the Izhmas small bore biathlon rifles.
Lakefield 90B Biathlon was manufactured from 1991 to 1995 in Ontario, Canada by Lake Field Arms Ltd., which was acquired by Savage Arms, Inc. during late 1994. The rifle had an overall length of , a barrel length of , weighed , and was also available in a left handed version. The rifle had a one piece hardwood stock with a UIT rail and came with a handstop, and came with peep sights having 1/4 moa (0.073 mrad) click adjustments. The action had a thumb operated safety.
The ORSIS Biathlon .22 LR rifle was designed to be as close to the IBU weight limit of 3.5 kg as possible, and to have an adjustable stock design made of aluminum alloy and laminate wood to able to suit the body of any athlete. Prototypes were made between 2011 and 2013, and was shown to biathlon coaches at an exhibition in December 2013.
There are also biathlon air rifles (4.5 mm) used for summer biathlon, target sprint and training at 10 meters.
Fullbore.
The predecessor of biathlon, military patrol, was fired with fullbore rifles, and was part of the 1924 Olympics, as well as a demonstration event in 1928, 1936 and 1948.
From the start of the modern biathlon in 1958 until 1965, international competitions were held exclusively using high power centerfire cartridges (such as the .30-06 and 7.62 NATO). Fullbore biathlon was part of the Winter Olympic Games in 1960, 1964, 1968, 1972 and 1976. Fullbore World Championships were held from Saalfelden 1958 to Vingrom 1977, with Lake Placid 1973 being the first time the World Championships took place outside Europe. Caliber discussions was a recurring subject, and there was a long trend of different nations moving towards various 6.5 mm or smaller calibers. In 1976 it was decided by the International Modern Pentathlon Union (UIPM) that all international championships starting from 1 January 1978 would be conducted using the .22 Long Rifle (LR) smallbore caliber. The last major championship using fullbore rifles was the 1977 World Championship in Vingrom, Norway. From 1978, .22 LR smallbore was the official caliber in international biathlon. High power centerfire cartridges are, however, still used today in Nordic field biathlon and moose biathlon competitions.
In 1960, the sole event was the men's 20 km individual, with shooting at the four distances of 100, 150, 200 and 250 meters. From 1963, all biathletes switched to cartridges based on the 6.5 mm projectile. As a result, the Soviet Union developed the Bi-6.5 rifle and the new cartridge .220 Russian (5.6×39mm) (which would later lead to development of the famous 5.45×39mm military cartridge). The newly developed 5.6×39mm cartridge was also used in 100 meter running deer competitions in specially developed sport rifles such as the MBO-1M and MBO-2 () straight pull rifles, as well as the MBO-3 pump rifle.
In 1966, with the addition of the relay event, the target distance was reduced to 150 m. The shooting range was reduced to 50 m in 1978 with the standardization of the rimfire cartridge, and the self-indicating targets used today made their debut at the 1980 Winter Olympics.
While international biathlon switched to smallbore, Nordic field biathlon and moose biathlon continued to use fullbore rifles. Currently only iron sights are permitted in field biathlon, and the firearm must be on an approved list. In moose biathlon however, any scope and fullbore rifle legal for moose hunting are permitted, and the ammunition also has to satisfy the legal kinetic energy requirement for hunting moose.
The Winchester Model 70 in caliber .30-06, .308 Win and .243 Win has been used by U.S. athletes.
Austrian biathletes competed with fullbore rifles at the 1964, 1968 and 1976 Olympics.
British biathletes competed with fullbore rifles at the 1960, 1964, 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympics.
Bulgarian biathletes competed with fullbore rifles at the 1976 Olympics.
Canadian biathletes competed with fullbore rifles at the 1968 Olympics.
During the 1950s, the Ross straight-pull rifle became well known at the biathlon and running deer competition circuits in Europe. Visiting shooters at the 1958 World Championships in Moscow had the opportunity to borrow Ross rifles converted to the 7.62x54R Soviet cartridge. Ross rifles with slings, target sights and 3-position stocks were used with success by Soviet biathletes.
Czechoslovakian biathletes competed with fullbore rifles at the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympics.
Finnish biathletes competed with fullbore rifles at the 1960, 1964, 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympics, and at the 1965, 1969, 1974, 1975 and 1977 World Championships. "Ampumahiihtokivääri" is the Finnish word for biathlon rifle. Fullbore biathlon competitions are still held in Finland to this day in moose biathlon.
French biathletes competed with fullbore rifles at the 1960, 1964, 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympics. At the 1962 World Championship and 1964 Olympics, French athletes used Swedish rifles with folding stocks.
West and East Germany sent a joint team competing as the United Team of Germany at the 1956, 1960, and 1964 Winter Olympics. Separate teams competed in 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1984 and 1988.
East Germany competed as a separate team at the 1965, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1977 World Championships.
Examples of manufacturers who made German biathlon rifles were Anschütz and Walther. In 1975, before the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, the West German team contacted Anschütz with the aim to develop a more competitive rifle. The .222 Rem centerfire cartridge was selected, and Anschütz fullbore biathlon rifles (1530) were made based on the design of the smallbore Anschütz 54 model.
Hungarian biathletes competed with fullbore rifles at the 1960 Olympics
Italian biathletes competed with fullbore rifles at the 1972 and 1976 Olympics.
Japanese biathletes competed with fullbore rifles at the 1964, 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympics. At the 1964 Olympics, Japanese athletes used Swedish rifles with folding stocks.
Mongolian biathletes competed with fullbore rifles at the 1964 and 1968 Olympics
So called HV-Mauser's were popular in Norway during the early days of modern biathlon competitions, which were captured WW2 German Mauser K98k rifles rechambered to .30-06 Springfield (7.62x63 mm) by Kongsberg våpenfabrikk in the early 1950s. However, the short sight radius of the HV-Mauser made precise aiming difficult, so competitors soon rebuilt and modernized their rifles by adding a longer barrel and diopter sights, usually with globe inserts.
Contrary to other forms of shooting within DFS, biathlon competitions allowed the use of custom built rifles. Most Norwegian custom built rifles were based on either the Mauser M59 or M67 standard rifles otherwise used in DFS, which were modified to suit the preferences of the athlete. There was never any large scale serial production of dedicated fullbore biathlon rifles in Norway, but a common recipe for a custom build was to start with a Mauser mechanism with a 19 mm barrel profile, and add diopter sights such as either Kongsberg Elit, Söderin or Redfield. Most preferred the 6.5×55 mm caliber, but the 7.62 NATO caliber was also used by many.
Special biathlon stock designs mimicking those seen in free rifle at the time also started to become common. A cottage industry emerged, with for example aftermarket stocks based on balsa wood being produced. These were lightweight and ergonmically shaped, and were produced mainly for the M67, but also to some extent for the M59 and Krag-Jørgensen. However, custom stock designs were not permitted in Nordic Bullseye and Field shooting competitions. Some competitors solved this by having two sets of stocks for their rifle; one to be used for Bullseye and Field competitions in the summer, and a biathlon stock for the winter season.
By 1970, most Norwegian athletes preferred the 6.5×55 mm and 7.62 NATO calibers, and top competitors had begun using dedicated shooting slings and carrying harnesses, as well as dedicated ammunition belts for easier carry and access. At the 1975 Norwegian Biathlon Championship, over half of the competitors used custom fullbore biathlon rifles built to their own specifications. Almost all custom rifles were built in the 6.5x55 mm caliber. A considerable amount of shooters also competed with stock rifles, mostly the Kongsberg M/67 F1 sharpshooter rifle, but also the Kongsberg M59 and Kongsberg M59 F1. A few athletes competed with other rifles (both stock and custom), such as the Sako L 579 biathlon. In total more than 5 or 6 different types of calibers were used at the 1975 Norwegian Championship, including .30-06 Springfield, .243 Win and others. Towards the end of the fullbore caliber era, smaller fullbore calibers such as the .223 Remington became more widespread in use. For example, Sako Vixen rifles in .223 Rem were used by some Norwegian competitions, equipped with an ergonomic stock and a modern biathlon carrying harness.
Aftermarket stocks and custom fullbore biathlon rifles continued to be permitted in Nordic field biathlon competitions during a transitional period until 31 December 2010, after which only standard rifles approved for other competitions in DFS has been permitted in field biathlon competitions, which in practice means only Sig Sauer 200 STR.
Polish biathletes competed with fullbore rifles at the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympics, and at the 1965, 1966, 1967, 1971 and 1975 World Championships.
Romanian biathletes competed with fullbore rifles at the 1968, 1972 Olympics and 1976 Olympics, and at the 1965 and 1974 World Championships
In 1958, Soviet athletes competed in the first world championship in Austria using the standard Mosin rifle, but already returned in 1959 using the specially designed Bi-59 biathlon rifle built by Shestryakov (А. С. Шестериков) at Izhmash by modyfing the standard Mosin rifle with a new barrel, stock and diopter sight. At the 1960 Winter Olympics 20 km individual, Soviet biathlete Alexander Privalov won the bronze medal using the Bi-59 rifle. In 1961 the Soviet team reveived a new biathlon rifle called Bi-7,62, where 7.62 refers to the caliber used. Some of the improvements were added covers protecting the muzzle and diopter sight from snow and debris. The Bi-59 and Bi-7,62 would both continue to be used by Soviet athletes in competitions until the end of the 1970s. Bi-6,5 and BiL-6,5 () in rifles (the latter based on a hunting carbine) were later Soviet fullbore biathlon developments in 6.5 mm caliber aimed at reducing recoil and weight. The Bi-5 rifle was introduced in 1971, and was used by Soviet athletes to take gold medals in 1972 and 1976. The Bi-5 was produced serially between 1973 and 1975, but was only used for competitions inside the Soviet Union. The rifle had its world debut at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, with the impressive results of Nikolay Kruglov taking the individual gold medal as well as the Soviet team winning the relay.
Various models of the Swedish Carl Gustav biathlon rifles were popular. In the 1960 Winter Olympics at Squaw Valley, Klas Lestander from Sweden won the first olympic biathlon event using the Carl Gustaf CG-62 rifle. The rifle was available in both 7.62 NATO and 6.5×55mm, and was dubbed the "rifle with the folding butt" due to its m/45 style folding stock. In the 1962 World Championships, another folding stock rifle called m/Salla was used instead by both the Swedish and French teams. In the Biathlon event at the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, the Swedish folding stock rifle would again be used by both the Swedish, French and Japanese teams. The main advantage of having a folder was easier carry, but the design soon disappeared from the competition circuit due to the development of new carrying harnesses. Biathlon in Sweden was long governed by the Swedish Multisport Association ("Svenska Mångkampsförbundet", formerly "Sveriges militära idrottsförbund"), as opposed to the FSR. Therefore, there were some Swedish biathlon rifles which were not approved for other types of competitions within the FSR, like for example the Carl Gustaf CG-67 (Skidskyttegevär CG-67).
Swiss biathletes competed with fullbore rifles at the 1976 Olympics. The WF Bern Precision Carbine ("Präzisionskarabiner") Model 74B was built in 1974 according to international biathlon competition rules, and chambered for the 7.5×55mm cartridge. It is based on a K31 action, with the main differences being diopter sights, a heavy barrel, anatomic stock with a rubber buttpad and an adjustable two stage trigger.
Other special K31 variants are the Präzisionskarabiner Modell 65 and 70B, which differed from more common civilian K31 versions having more modifications as permitted by UIPMB (biathlon) and UIT (free rifle) competition rules. This compared to more common civilian K31 versions used in Swiss shooting matches, which are similar to those issued by the military except for aftermarket diopter sights.
Taiwanese (Republic of China) biathletes competed with fullbore rifles at the 1976 Olympics.

Willis Museum

The Willis Museum is a local history museum in the Market Place, Basingstoke, Hampshire, England. The building, which was the headquarters of Basingstoke Borough Council, is a Grade II listed building.
History.
The building.
Since the 14th century a Mote Hall was situated in Market Place, just to the east of Lloyds Bank. The present building, which was designed in the neoclassical style, was completed in 1835. The building served as a corn exchange and market hall and dances were held in the room upstairs. It was also the headquarters of the Council of the Borough of Basingstoke until the borough was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972 in 1974. It then served as the headquarters of the enlarged District of Basingstoke until the Civic Offices opened nearby in 1981. It has been home to the Willis Museum since 1984.
The museum.
The museum was originally housed in the old (now demolished) Mechanics' Institute building in New Road. It was founded by the local clockmaker, George W. Willis, as the Basingstoke Museum in 1931. Renamed after the founder in 1956, the Willis Museum was expanded to cover the town and surrounding area's history, from the Upper Cretaceous Age through to the development experienced during the 1960s and 1970s. It moved to the Town Hall in 1984. As well as funding from visitor donations, the Willis Museum receives grant funding from Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council.
Exhibitions.
Displays covers local history, including remains of an ancient human known as "Basingstoke Man" and what is rumoured to be the world’s oldest wedding cake. In 2014, the museum faced criticism after some medieval coins, donated by a local treasure hunter, were removed from display.
In January 2018 the museum faced criticism after specialist job roles were cut as part of a restructure of the wider Hampshire Cultural Trust service.
The museum is home to the Sainsbury Gallery, which hosts temporary exhibitions. The gallery was added to the museum in 2008 with funding by the Linbury Trust, founded by Lord Sainsbury. Previous exhibitions in the Sainsbury Gallery have included:
Jane Austen statue.
Situated outside the museum is a statue of Jane Austen. The life-sized bronze figure was created by sculptor Adam Roud as part of a series of events marking the 200th anniversary of the writer's death. It is considered to be the first of Austen in the world. The events were credited with boosting the previously falling number of visitors to the museum, though it is unknown for how long or successfully this effect will last.
The location was chosen as it is speculated to be the same square Austen would have visited to go shopping or to dance at the assembly rooms nearby. The statue was unveiled at a public ceremony attended by civic figures as well as Austen fans (or "Janeites") in Regency costume. Jane Austen spent the first 25 years of her life in nearby Steventon, where her father was vicar. Roud claimed that the statue represents Austen as a "daughter and a sister" as she walked through the town.

James Nesbitt (bushranger)

James Nesbitt (27 August 1858 - 17 November 1879), was a member of the Wantabadgery Bushrangers led by Andrew George Scott alias Captain Moonlite.
Meeting Andrew George Scott.
It is possible that Nesbitt was romantically involved with the leader of the Wantabadgery Bushrangers Andrew George Scott.
Nesbitt met Scott while both were serving time in Pentridge Prison. Growing up in a poor household with an abusive father, Nesbitt turned to crime at a young age and had been in and out of jail for petty theft since he was a teenager. Little is known about their relationship in Pentridge except that a day was added to Nesbitt’s sentence for ‘taking tea to Prisoner Scott’. Scott was released from Pentridge after serving less than 7 years, his sentence being reduced from 10 for good behaviour. Nesbitt, who had been released a year before, waited for him at the gates. Together they moved into a rundown boarding house in Fitzroy.
The Wantabadgery Bushrangers.
Late October 1879 Andrew George Scott lead a group of men out of Melbourne looking for work. This group included Nesbitt, 19-year-old Frank Johns, 22-year-old ex-con Thomas Rogan and young 15-year-old Augustus Warnecke. Latter 18-year-old Graham Bennet joined their group. When no work was to be found hunger and desperation got the better of them and they held up Wantabadgery Station earning them the reputation as the "Wantabadgery Bushrangers".
While they were holed up in the farmhouse of Edmund McGlede the police pursued them, leading to a gunfight. During the gunfight Nesbitt was shot in the head. It was reported that Scott pulled Nesbitt into his arms and held him as he died, sobbing uncontrollably.
Augustus Warnecke also died in the gunfight at the McGlede farm.
One police officer, Constable Bowen was mortally wounded in the gunfight; it is unknown who shot him but forensic evidence suggests it was not Scott or Nesbitt.

Alice Headwards-Hunter

Alice Mabel Headwards-Hunter, LAH, FRCSEd (late 1800s – 11 September 1973) was the first woman to become a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. While she was the first woman to be given a seat in the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, she declined the seat and instead went to pursue work abroad. While she chose to decline this seat she has pioneered the way for many future female physicians to come. She spent her professional life in India, caring mainly for women and children. The Indian Government recognised her service by the award of the Kaiser-i-Hind medal.
Early life.
Headwards-Hunter was born in India in the late 1800s, the daughter of an Indian Army Officer. She received her education in England and in 1910 graduated LAH as a licentiate of the Apothecaries Hall of Ireland.
Career.
Headwards-Hunter returned to India in 1918 and worked initially in a British troop hospital as a Captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps. After the war she took a post at the Peshawar Municipal Hospital focusing on women and child health.
She returned to Europe and in 1920, became the first woman to obtain the F.R.C.S.Ed diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons Edinburgh. In 1919, the Sex Disqualification Removal Act was passed in Great Britain making it illegal to exclude any woman from employment because of her gender. In the months following the passing of this Act, Nancy Astor became the first woman to sit as Member of Parliament and, on 20 October 1920, Headwards-Hunter became the first woman to be admitted as a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.
Returning to Calcutta in 1923, she set up a private practice concerned with woman and children. Hunter was actively involved in development of health visitor training in India.
She was also Divisional Surgeon to the Calcutta Brigade of the St John Ambulance, an organisation that she was to support throughout her life. She particularly valued the honour of Serving Sister and honorary life member of St John Ambulance awarded in 1946. She became President of the YMCA in Calcutta and later President of all India YWCA.
In 1933, she went as a front line St John's Ambulance doctor to the area which had been devastated by the Monghyr earthquake. The Second World War saw her practice intensify particularly when fighting reached the Indian/Burmese border.
In 1942, she was one of the first women to go into Nepal, which at that time, remained a closed country. She was to attend the Crown Princess of Nepal. The following year, during the Bengal famine, she was asked by the Bengal government to set up a temporary hospital for child famine victims.
Her work was recognised in 1945 when she was awarded the Kaisar-i-Hind Silver Medal.
She continued to work in India and Pakistan until her retirement in the 1950s when she and her husband moved to Ireland.
Death.
She died in Bruntsfield Hospital, Edinburgh on 11 September 1973.
Legacy.
In 2007, the Royal College of Surgeons Edinburgh awarded the first Hunter-Doig Medal. The medal is presented to a female RCSEd Member or Fellow in recognition of excellence. It is named for Alice Headwards-Hunter as first female Fellow of the College and Caroline Doig, the first female member of the College Council. The award is presented to female surgeons who show both excellence and potential to advance their field. The Surgeons Hall Museum wrote that this award is given because, "[...] two female surgeons both of whom have achieved something no women had before."

Lila Clunas

Lila Clunas (born Maggie Eliza Clunas 10 August 1876 – 29 December 1968) was a Scottish suffragette and Labour party councillor.
Biography.
Lila Clunas was born in Glasgow on 10 August 1876, to parents Elsie Melvin and Hugh Clunas, a dress shop owner. Her sisters were Jessie and Elsie. She was schooled at Bell Baxter High School, Cupar, and completed her teacher training in Moray House Teacher Training College, Edinburgh. She then moved to Dundee where she taught at the Brown Street Elementary Public School. In later life, she lived with her sister Elsie in Broughty Ferry.
Political career.
In 1906, she joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). The following year, she joined the Women's Freedom League (WFL), serving as the secretary of the Dundee branch between 1908 –1912. Her sisters Elsie and Jessie were also members of the WFL, with Elsie serving as treasurer until 1913. She was succeeded as secretary by Helen Wilkie.
Her political activities included deputations, heckling and writing in the press. In 1908 she was expelled from an election meeting for Winston Churchill. In 1909, she was a member of a 9-woman delegation to the House of Commons. During a WSPU deputation at the end of June, she was arrested while presenting a petition to Prime Minister Asquith, although it has been suggested that she attempted to take a swipe at him. She was charged with obstruction and was sentenced to three weeks in prison. She was imprisoned in the London Holloway Prison, and was the first Dundee suffragette to be held there. She went on hunger strike, and was released early, "on consideration of all the circumstances and as an act of clemency".
In 1914 she was ejected from a Ramsay MacDonald meeting, and this led to a split between the suffragettes and the Dundee Labour Party.
In 1943 she was elected as a Labour Party Councillor in the Dundee City Council, and served until 1964. She had a particular interest in education.
Clunas died 29 December 1968 in Dundee.
Memorials.
In 2008, the building that was Brown Street Elementary School was marked with a commemoration plaque in Clunas's honour.

Darío Ortiz (footballer)

Hernán Darío Ortiz (born 14 July 1967) is an Argentine football manager and former professional footballer who played as a defender. He is currently the manager of Mitre.
Playing career.
Ortiz's career started in 1989 with Gimnasia y Esgrima. He made his debut in the Argentine Primera División, which was the first of two hundred and fifteen appearances in Argentina's top tier. After seven years with Gimnasia y Esgrima, Ortiz left in 1996 to play for Huracán of the Primera División. He scored one goal in thirty-six matches during 1996–97 which ended with relegation. He remained in the Primera División as he signed for Gimnasia y Tiro but suffered relegation yet again following twenty-two appearances. Ortiz ended his career with moves to Primera B Nacional teams Almirante Brown and Independiente Rivadavia.
Coaching career.
Ortiz made his first step into football management in May 2011, as he became manager of former club Gimnasia y Esgrima. He drew his first match in charge against Quilmes. He departed the club in July 2011 as Gimnasia y Esgrima were relegated to Primera B Nacional. On 8 April 2012, Ortiz was appointed Primera B Nacional side Boca Unidos's new manager. He guided them to a fifth place finish in 2011–12, missing the play-offs by twelve points. He remained until December 2012 when he resigned. June 2014 saw Ortiz become the manager of Estudiantes alongside Pablo Morant in Torneo Federal A.

Giovan Domenico Vinaccia

Giovan (Gian) Domenico Vinaccia (13 March 1625, Massa Lubrense - July 1695, Naples) was an Italian architect, goldsmith, engineer and sculptor.
Life.
He learned sculpture and architecture from Dionisio Lazzari. His first surviving independent work was the 1661 choir stalls in San Pietro ad Aram. Three years later he produced the high altar for the Royal Chapel of the Treasure of St. Januarius in Naples Cathedral, showing archbishop Alessandro Carafa who had brought St Januarius' relics to Naples. He also produced reliquaries for the Chiesa del Gesù Nuovo and designed another high altarpiece in Sant'Anna dei Lombardi, although the latter was actually carved by the Ghetti brothers. The architectural-sculptural scheme in Santa Maria dei Miracoli was also carved by him.
He also designed the facade of the Chiesa del Gesù Vecchio, the pavement and interior of Santa Maria Donnaregina Nuova, the altar in San Giuseppe dei Ruffi and the marbles in Sant’Andrea delle Dame. He collaborated with Lorenzo Vaccaro on several other works.

Campfire is the twelfth studio album by Australian recording artist James Blundell, released in February 2017. The album peaked at number 58 on the ARIA Albums Chart, becoming Blundell's first album to make the top 100 since "Earth &amp; Sea" in 1995.
Background.
In mid 2016, Blundell started the recording "Campfire", following a conversation with collaborator and Red Rebel Music head Karen Waters about Bruce Springsteen's album "Nebraska"; an album recorded at home and on the cheap. Blundell told "Canberra Times" "She said to me, "How would you like to forget about the writing and do something just for the joy of singing?" And that sounded wonderful." With that in mind, Blundell and Waters unearthed songs with great stories and telling them the way you would around a campfire, with a beer and great friends.

Biuro Odszkodowań Wojennych BOW (ang. Polish War Reparations Bureau) - institution established in 1945 by the Presidium of the Council of Ministers in Warsaw to assess the war losses suffered by Poland during the Second World War in 1939-1945. The office dealt with determining and estimating the war losses suffered by the Polish state, as well as private individuals in the field of material and cultural goods, coordinating work related to the compensation and recovery.
History.
The Military Compensation Center was first established institution at September 27, 1944 before the end of World War II, by decree Polish Committee of National Liberation. In 1947 "Biuro Odszkodowań Wojennych" prepared a report "Report on the losses and damages of war in Poland in 1939-1945" describing the number of material and biological Polish losses during the war.
During the war, Poland lost 6,028,000 persons of its community, of these 616,000 on account of immediate military action.
The losses sustained by the railways are put at 84%, those of the postal system and telecommunications — at 62%, those of the education system — at 60%, the material cultural assets were lost in 43%, the damage to forests — so hard to ameliorate — is calculated at 28%. But that is not the point of gravity. Poland has over a million citizens infected with tuberculosis, half a million invalids incapable of working, 22% of all Polish citizens have perished.

Kabir (film)

Kabir is a 2018 Indian Bengali-language action thriller film directed by Aniket Chattopadhyay, starring Dev and Rukmini Maitra which released on 13 April 2018.
Plot.
The story line of the film is based on apprehension of co-founder of Indian Mujahideen and conspirator of several bomb blasts in India, Yasin Bhatkal, by National Investigation Agency near Indo-Nepal border.
The story of the film begins with a few bomb blasts in Mumbai.
A burkha clad lady, Yasmin, aged in between 22/23 years, took a taxi from Zaveri Bazaar she was going to VT station. There were ambulances, police vehicles on the way. It was a scary afternoon. The taxi suddenly stopped, it was a comparatively lonely area. The taxi driver refused to give any reason but firmly said that he would not go towards VT. Yasmin was trying to get a lift, but the vehicles didn’t stop. After a few minutes, a car stopped and agreed to give her a lift. The person inside introduced himself as Abir Chatterjee; he was also going to VT station.
On the way to VT, Yasmin had a phone conversation with her father, whom we found to be a half paralysed old man in his Kolkata house. She assured her father, who was watching TV news regarding Bomb blasts in Mumbai. The car reached VT stn, Yasmin got down, thanked Abir. She rushed to the station. Going inside the station, she found that the Duronto Express was late for 2hrs, so she went to the upper class waiting room. Yasmin &amp; Abir met again in the compartment, they both were going to Howrah.
Kabir flirts with Yasmin though she is irritated, shares food with her and then enquires about her. As a matter of courtesy, Yasmin decides to ask more about Abir. Much to her shock, he reveals a live video of her father held hostage and a video of her cousin sister, Ruksana. He threatens to kill them if she doesn't reveal the location of Imtiaz. Her attempts to contact a few friends fail, and she is asked to reveal his location before the train reach Howrah. 
The next day he reveals that he is a jihadi, and a majority of the passengers in their compartment are his aides. He adds that Imtiaz was a jihadi who foiled their attempts back in 2012 by informing the police. They badly want to murder the traitor. This changes Yasmin's attitude which in turn narrates another version of his story according to which it was the owner of the house who betrayed the terrorists; Imtiaz was killed by the special task force, and she herself is a jihadi. Abir, who in the meanwhile has changed his name to Altar Kabir, which he claims to be his original name, refuses to believe her as the photos of those dead jihadis and the rooms in which they lived had a different description from what she told. She is irritated by his behaviour and contacts the Syed, Indian Mujahideen third-in-command and gives information about Kabir through his unique code number (a unique code to identify the jihadis). Parallel to this, a few police officers struggling to decode those codes manage to trace Syed through Yasmin's phone call and arrest him. 
Kabir reveals himself to be a special task officer assigned to bring down the Indian Mujahideen gang. Yasmin says that there is no use of arresting her as the Indian police will be forced to hand over her to their head gang in exchange for a few hostages. Kabir understanding the meaning of her statement, kills her and shoot his hand as if to show that he killed her while trying to defend himself from her.

Temple of Poseidon, Sounion

The ancient Greek temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion, built during 444–440 BC, is one of the major monuments of the Golden Age of Athens. A Doric temple, it overlooks the sea at the end of Cape Sounion, at an elevation of almost .
History.
The original, Archaic-period temple of Poseidon on the site, which was built of tufa, was probably destroyed in 480 BC by Persian troops during Xerxes I's invasion of Greece. Although there is no direct evidence for Sounion, Xerxes certainly had the temple of Athena, and everything else on the Acropolis of Athens, razed as punishment for the Athenians' defiance. After they defeated Xerxes in the naval Battle of Salamis, the Athenians placed an entire captured enemy trireme (warship with three banks of oars) at Sounion as a trophy dedicated to Poseidon.
The temple of Poseidon at Sounion was constructed in 444–440 BC. This was during the ascendancy of the Athenian statesman Pericles, who also rebuilt the Parthenon in Athens.
It was built on the ruins of a temple dating from the Archaic period. Strabo noted:
Architecture.
The design of the peripteros temple is a typical hexastyle, i.e., it had a front portico with six Doric columns. 
16 out of the 38 columns are standing today (of which four were re-erected in the 20th century).
The temple closely resembles the contemporary and well-preserved Temple of Hephaestus beneath the Acropolis, which may have been designed by the same architect.
The Poseidon building was rectangular, with a colonnade on all four sides encompassing the peristasis. 
The total number of original columns of the outer colonnade was 34, of which 15 still stand today (with the addition of 1 out of 4 columns of the inner "naos"). 
The columns are of the Doric Order. They were made of white marble quarried locally at Laureotic Olympus. They were 6.10 m (20 ft) tall, with a diameter of 1 m (3.1 ft) at the base and 79 cm (31 inches) at the top.
At the centre of the temple, beyond the colonnade, there would have been the hall of worship ("naos"), a windowless rectangular room, similar to the partly intact hall at the Temple of Hephaestus. It would have contained, at one end facing the entrance, the cult image, a colossal, ceiling-height () bronze statue of Poseidon.
Archaeology.
Early study of the ruins, without excavations, was performed by the Society of Dilettanti in 1797 and by Guillaume-Abel Blouet (Morea expedition 1829).
The first excavations were made by Wilhelm Dörpfeld, director of the German Archaeological Institute, in 1884.
Systematic excavations by Valerios Stais followed in 1897–1913.
Efforts at restoring and preserving the remains of the Poseidon temple began in 1875. The monument's present state is due to the work performed in the 1950s by the Greek Archaeological Service, led by Anastasios Orlandos.
The excavation campaign by Stais in the 1906 season uncovered numerous artifacts and inscriptions, most notably a marble kouros statue known as the Sounion Kouros (ca. 590 BC) and the relief of a "self-crowning athlete" (ca. 460 BC), both now in the Athens National Archaeological Museum. 
A column from the temple can be seen in the British Museum.
The project Arrangement of the Archaeological Site of Sounion (2011–2013) was co-financed by the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sports and the European Union (ERDF).

Palau High School (PHS) is a senior high school in Koror City, Palau. Opened in 1962, it is the country's only public high school, and the first high school established in Palau. The Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) accredits the school.
The United States captured the Palau islands from Japan in 1944, and the Department of the United States Navy setup the school system in 1946. , it operated elementary schools on a number of islands for grades 1–6, and opened Palau Intermediate School, in a building left by the Japanese, for the grades 7–9, offering a curriculum of Vocational Education Programs. Palau had passed formally to the United States under United Nations auspices in 1947 as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the U.S. Trustees extended the education system to add grades 10–12 in 1962; the elementary schools took on grades 1–9 and the Intermediate School building was converted into Palau High School, offering a mix of academic and vocational curricula for the older students.
A new building was completed sometime between the late 1960s and the middle of the 1970s, a period when several other public structures were built by the U.S. Trustees across the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. When Palau entered the Compact of Free Association in 1982, it took on more responsibility for its own education system, taking full control when it achieved independence in 1994.

Born in Carrara of Roman descent sometime in the 17th century, he trained in Bernini's workshop and often collaborated with his brother Bartolomeo as well as working independently. Scholar believe that Bartolomeo usually worked on ornament whilst Pietro usually worked on sculpting the figures.
Life.
He is documented as working in Naples from 1671 onwards, having followed Bernini's architect and sculptor brother Luigi to the city.

Seismic risk in Malta

Seismic risk in Malta is considered to be low with little historic damage noted and no known victims. The archipelago is however in a potentially significant seismic zone and the risk to the population is probably undervalued.
Tectonics.
The Maltese archipelago rests on an underwater plateau, a relatively stable part of the African plate. The islands are situated around 200 km to the south of the subduction fault between the African plates and the Eurasian plates. The pelagic plate forms a shallow platform separating the Ionian basin from the Western Mediterranean basin, situated roughly under the Sicilian Channel. The plate is crossed by a rift zone formed of three grabens: the Pantelleria graben, that of Malta, and that of Linosa. These grabens are linked by a system of North-South orientation faults (sometimes West-East) with dextral cavities that are responsible for most of the earthquakes that can affect the archipelago.
The islands themselves are made up of limestone rocks from the Oligocene and Miocene geological epochs, belonging to the Cenozoic era.
List of major earthquakes.
Prior to the 20th century and the first seismic recordings in the region, information on Maltese earthquakes was researched in archives. These range mostly from the arrival of the knights of the Order of St John of Jerusalem in 1530 to the British colonisation of Malta. After this period, the localisation of the epicentres of earthquakes in the Sicilian Channel has been relatively limited, mostly due to an inadequate network of seismic stations, particularly before 1980.
Details of major earthquakes.
Earthquake of 10 December 1542.
The "Sicilian Chronicle of the 16th century" reports that the earthquake of 10 December 1542 was strongly felt in Malta where some houses were knocked down.
Earthquake of 11 January 1693.
The earthquake of 11 January 1693 in Val di Noto is the most significant earthquake felt in Malta since the 16th century. In Sicily, it caused the death of around 60,000 individuals. With a magnitude of 7.4, it is considered to be the most powerful earthquakes in Italian history. The earthquake was preceded on 9 January by a precursory earthquake of a magnitude of around 5.9 which was strongly felt but did not cause damage.
In Malta, the earthquake provoked panic among the population, with many Maltese refusing to go back to their homes in the nights that followed, seeking refuge in tents or underground shelters. No victims were reported. The Order delegated its head engineer, Mederico Blondel to assess the damage. At Valletta, no building escaped unharmed by the earthquake, from simple cracks to complete demolition. The other towns of the Grand Harbour were considerably less affected. However, the old city of Mdina suffered more greatly as many of the buildings were older and were poorly maintained. Notably St. Paul's Cathedral was part destroyed – but the cathedral was already badly damaged before the earthquake, and so a reconstruction had already been planned. The "Banca Giuratale" in Mdina was equally damaged, and would be rebuilt in 1726 by Charles François de Mondion. At Rabat, the bell tower and the apse of the church of St. Paul came down. The Tal-Virtù Church suffered considerable damage, it was situated at a high altitude which was particularly susceptible to earthquakes.
At Gozo, the walls of the Cittadella were damaged, but Blondel notes that the damage were more likely caused by years of neglect. The Cathedral of the Assumption, Gozo lost its bell tower.
The considerable damage material in Malta has been attributed to the maximum earthquake intensity of 7–8.
Earthquake of 20 February 1743.
Local historian Gian Pietro Francesco Agius de Soldanis recounts 20 February 1743 earthquake in his magnum opus "Il Gozo Antico-Moderno e Sacro-Profano", a two-volume manuscript dealing with the history of Gozo completed in 1746: 
A document in the archives of the cathedral of Mdina described how the "coppolino" (the little dome) of the cathedral fell into the church, the back end of the choir was destroyed and the bell tower heavily damaged. The cathedral was so cracked in all areas that: 
An account by six architects described three large cracks of around 3 cm in width on each side of the cupola, revealing most of the stones in the cupola and the terrible damage to the walls of the choir.
Earthquake of 12 October 1856.
The epicentre situated near Crete was very seriously hit by the particularly violent earthquake of 12 October 1856. Certain seismic registers attribute it with a magnitude of 8.2. It claimed numerous victims in Crete. Despite being at a distance of more than 1000 km from the epicentre, the earthquake was violently felt in Malta, as the newspapers of the era testify. People were woken in the middle of the night by a deafening growl and a movement of the earth that lasted between 22 and 60 seconds. Nearly all the houses in Valletta were damaged, as were houses in Gozo, notably on the upper floors. Numerous churches were affected, and in particular the cathedral of Mdina. The belltower of the church of the Carmelites at Mdina was so cracked that it needed to be rebuilt. The chapel on the islet of Filfla was destroyed. The 17th-century Għajn Ħadid Tower collapsed in this earthquake and has remained in ruins ever since.
Earthquake of 27 August 1886.
This was probably the earthquake on the same day that struck the SW Peloponnese. Once again, the local papers reported a general panic in the population that rushed outside dwellings, awoken by the earthquake on 27 August 1886. Some buildings were affected, including the ceiling of the Palace of Justice in Valletta. For once, the cathedral in Mdina was not greatly affected.
Earthquake of 30 September 1911.
30 September 1911 earthquake was more distinctly felt in Gozo than in Malta. Newspapers reported the appearance of deep cracks in the domes and the belltowers of many churches, in particular at Nadur, Għarb, and Ir-Rabat, Gozo, where many public buildings were affected. Numerous rural buildings were completely destroyed. Fort Chambray was badly hit. Many landslides were reported on the isle of Gozo. In Malta, damage was limited to a few cracks.
Earthquake of 18 September 1923.
18 September 1923 earthquake was the first to follow the installation of a Milne seismograph at Valletta. Sadly, it seems not to have worked and gave no useful information; the seismologic data is therefore not clear. The shock seems to have been most felt around the Grand Harbour. Some damage was reported, such as the falling of the stone crosses on churches or cracks in the domes. The greatest ravages seem to have been those exerted on the church of St Paul in Rabat, Malta. The Tal-Virtù Church was badly damaged and remained unused for more than 70 years.
Details of major tsunamis.
Tsunami of 16 January 1693.
The tsunami of 16 January 1693 occurred contemporaneously with the strong earthquake. Agius de Soldanis recounts how the sea at Xlendi turned a thousand times before returning with force.
Tsunami of 28 December 1908.
The tsunami of 28 December 1908 corresponds to the earthquake of the Strait of Messina. At least three large waves caused significant damage and took a number of victims in the east of Sicily. The waves of this tsunami hit the shores of Malta an hour later, causing flooding at Msida, where part of the old town was damaged. At Marsaxlokk a foaming wave crossed the main road hitting the church of St. Peter. At Sliema, the sea came and went with force. The sea level was registered as abnormally high in the Grand Harbour. Many fishing boats were damaged or destroyed, but no deaths were reported.
Evaluation of seismic risk.
Seismic risk was evaluated at an event of intensity 8 happening every 1000 years and an event at intensity 6 happening every 92 years. Historically, since 1530, an earthquake of 7–8 intensity has been reported, as well as at least four events of intensity 7.
The risk of a tsunami wave between 4 m and 7 m high is estimated as a possibility every 600 to 1500 years. The occurrence of an event comparable to that of 1603, could have grave social and economic consequences as areas near the sea are largely built up, in particular for tourist activity in the region of Sliema.
Integration of risk in building standards.
Despite a proposed bill, no seismic building standards have been imposed as the rate of construction accelerates and numerous buildings are completed. The risk is increased further by building in unreinforced masonry, incorporating heavy floors and concrete roofs with often large cellars used as garages. This type of construction is particularly sensitive to earthquakes.

Creative journalism

Creative journalism refers to a journalistic story than has been enhanced in a creative way by the journalist, possibly with an intent to mislead or with an objective to cause an event to happen that otherwise would not.
Etymology.
"Creative journalism" has sometimes been applied to newly identified genres until a definitive designated is settled upon.
Meanings.
Linking creative writing and journalism.
One usage of the term "creative journalism" is to cover an overlap between "creating writing" and "journalism" that occurs in the feature writing, narrative literature and whatever. "Journalism" is the factual portrayal of news and events with minimal analysis and interpretation. By contrast "creative" is original expressive and imaginative. Creative writing refers to imagination
The UNICEF indicated it wished to celebrate "creative journalism" by was of the Meena Media award, though the award is mainly divided into "creative" and "journalistic" categories.
Created story.
Hugh Cudlipp has defined creative journalism differently, "as the art of causing something to occur that would not otherwise materialise" and the antithesis of the "phantom scoop" where the foretold event does not occur. He also puts it as "making news not faking news" This definition has been alluded to by others.
Creative presentation.
"Creative journalism" can be applied to a journalistic work that has creative presentation. Used this way if will often be used to denote a praiseworthy example of photojournalism, visual journalism or graphic journalism.
Euphemism.
The euphemism for "Creative journalism" refers to the similar use of 'creative' in "creative accounting". Here creative is used in the sense to mislead. The term has elements of relationship to tabloid journalism, yellow journalism and fakes news, though there are differences in emphasis and objectives. A significant difference from clickbait is the former but form emphasis on the story.
What creative journalism is not.
Creative journalism does not occur when the source(s) are incorrect or as a result of spin propaganda providing the journalist has not knowingly colluded or negligently failed to check sources.

Sant'Andrea delle Dame, Naples

Sant'Andrea delle Dame was an Augustinian monastery church dedicated to Saint Andrew with associated cloister and monastic buildings in Naples. The monastic buildings later became one of the buildings of the Università degli studi di Napoli and - after the establishment of the medicine faculty of the Università degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli - now house that faculty's Naples headquarters.
It was founded by four daughters of the notary Andrea Palescandolo in 1580 and designed either by their Theatine brother Marco Palescandolo or by Francesco Grimaldi. It opened on 7 March 1587, with the cloister completed early in the 17th century and a belvedere-style cloister known as the "Torretta reale" added in 1748. It was suppressed under the French occupation and the monastic church was deconsecrated in 1884. It was damaged by bombing and bombardment during the Second World War, but its original features survived. The church was restored in 2004.

Aigremont Lake

The Aigremont Lake is a freshwater body flowing out of the Little Chief River, flowing into the unorganized territory of Lac-Ashuapmushuan, Quebec, in the northwestern part of the Regional County Municipality (RCM) Le Domaine-du-Roy, in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean administrative region, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
This lake straddles the townships of Aigremont and Denaut. It is entirely located in the Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve. Its
southwest shore is less than from the former Nicabau Railway Station of the Canadian National Railway.
Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second.
The route 167 linking Chibougamau to Saint-Félicien, Quebec passes on the south shore of the lake. A forest road bypasses the lake. Farther south, the Canadian National Railway runs along the Normandin River, and approaches route 167 as it winds up to the northwest to Chibougamau.
The surface of Lake Aigremont is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.
Toponymy.
Formalized in 1925 by the Quebec Geography Commission, this hydronym evokes the work of life of François Clairambault d'Aigremont (1659-1728), acting intendant of Nouvelle-France. Toponymic variant: Lac de la Cache.
The toponym "Lake Aigremont" was made official on December 5, 1968 by the Commission de toponymie du Québec, either at the creation of this commission.

Shah Sultan Hussein mosque () is a historical mosque of the XVIII century, located in the village of Novkhany in Absheron district of Azerbaijan, 21 kilometers from Baku. It is estimated that the mosque was once located in the center of an ancient residential center, which currently is a desert.
About the mosque.
The mosque belongs to architectural school of Absheron.
Although the size of the mosque is small, size and tone keeps architectural elements in the walls. Motifs and architectural elements of the walls of the mosque, which are not large, are still preserved. The walls of the prayer room are decorated with ornaments. The dome is one of the basic constructions in the prayer room. The main function of it is to keep atmosphere of the hall constant, illuminate the hall, and create a reverberation in the hall. The exterior of the mosque and its architectural solution form unity. Prayer room is merged with service room.
In the framework of anti-religious policies, the mosque was closed to visitors by Soviet authorities in the 1930s. As a result, the mosque was destroyed and became useless.

Scottish Society of the History of Medicine

The Scottish Society of the History of Medicine (SSHM) was founded in 1948. Its aims are "to promote, encourage and support the study of the history of medicine", with a particular interest in Scottish Medicine. Founded at a time when the study of history of medicine was dominated by medical doctors, the society aimed, from the start, to have a broad based membership, to interest others in the subject. Historians, librarians, scientists, pharmacists and others have all played an active role in its activities, and representatives from these professions have become presidents.
Origins.
The SSHM was founded by Douglas Guthrie, an Edinburgh ENT surgeon who became a medical historian. Early in 1948 Guthrie wrote to a number of individuals throughout Scotland inviting them to a meeting to discuss the formation of a Scottish history of medicine society. The meeting was held in the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh on 23 April 1948. Those present agreed with Guthrie’s suggestion that it be called the Scottish Society of the History of Medicine and further agreed to adopt the constitution which he had prepared. Office bearers were appointed with Guthrie elected as the first president.
From the outset the SSHM aimed to be broad based and the initial members included medical doctors, dentists, pharmacists and librarians. Among the first papers heard at the society was one on quarantine from plague and another on the periodic devastation of Scotland by famines and epidemics.
At the end of the first year it was decided that meetings should be held in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and St Andrews. In addition there would be ‘outings to places of interest to medical historians', the first of which , on 18 June 1949, was to Lanark and Hamilton places associated with William Smellie and William Cullen. This was followed by a visit to the Hunter House Museum at Long Calderwood, birthplace of the brothers John and William Hunter. Subsequent outings included visits to Torphichen Preceptory (1950), Greyfriars Churchyard (1954), Liddesdale Heritage Centre, Newcastleton. (1955), the John Leyden Memorial at Denholm (1964) and the David Livingstone Centre, Blantyre (1973).
By the end of the second year the membership had exceeded 100 and by 1978 exceeded 150.
In 1965 the SSHM was one of four founder societies of the British Society for the History of Medicine, to which it remains affiliated.
Activities.
The Society holds an autumn meeting in Edinburgh, a spring meeting in Glasgow and a summer meeting at a chosen venue elsewhere in Scotland. In addition an annual lecture and dinner in honour of Haldane Tait. a former President and long-serving Secretary to the Society, is held in the summer, usually in Edinburgh.
Since the inaugural meeting in 1948, papers given to the society have been published as the "Report of Proceedings of the Scottish Society of the History of Medicine". These are now freely available online.
The Society has been registered as a charity in Scotland (SC008621) since 1973.
The Society's archives (1949–1995) are held at University of St Andrews Special Collections (Reference GB 227 msdep87) and the archives of the Douglas Guthrie Trust are held at the archive of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.
Douglas Guthrie Trust.
Established as a result of a bequest from Douglas Guthrie, the Trust is administered by the SSHM whose officers act as trustees. It offers funding to support research into history of medicine and is registered (SC000531) as a charity in Scotland.

No Straight Lines

No Straight Lines is an anthology of queer comics covering a 40-year period from the late 1960s to the late 2000s. It was edited by Justin Hall and published by Fantagraphics Books on August 1, 2012.
The anthology traces the turning points in the history of LGBT comics over the 40-year period, including events such as the AIDS crisis. It features work from established cartoonists such as Alison Bechdel, Howard Cruse, Roberta Gregory, Eric Shanower, and Paige Braddock, as well as then-up-and-coming cartoonists including Ellen Forney, Erika Moen, and Ariel Schrag.
Development.
Editor Justin Hall was inspired to put together the anthology after curating a show of LGBT comics at the Cartoon Art Museum for the San Francisco Pride in 2006. According to Hall, despite the prevalence of gay male erotica in the underground comics scene since the late 1950s, LGBT literary comics become a subgenre only after the 1969 Stonewall riots, when a "sense of community" emerged and the queer underground comix scene began to thrive in San Francisco. With this anthology, Hall wanted to document, preserve and celebrate the "hidden history" of queer comics.
Hall selected the works to include based on, in decreasing order of importance, "artistic merit, historic merit and representational merit". He explained that: "First and foremost, No Straight Lines should be a tremendously good read. After that, it should leave the reader with a better understanding of the complex history and diversity of LGBTQ comics".
Themes.
To put the material into an "historical and cultural context", the anthology is organized into three sections. The first section, "Comics Come Out: Gay Gag Strips, Underground Comix, and Lesbian Literati", covers the late-1960s and 1970s. It collects gag cartoons from early gay newspapers and magazines that emerged after the Stonewall riots, as well as works from the feminist and lesbian-oriented underground comix, concluding with the creation of the anthology series "Gay Comix". This section includes Trina Robbins' "Sandy Comes Out", which according to Hall was the first literary comic that "offered gay people a representation of themselves that validated, as opposed to degraded, their experience."
The second section, "File Under Queer: Comix to Comics, Punk Zines, and Art During the Plague", covers the 1980s and 1990s time period, focusing on the artistic responses to the AIDS crisis, as well as the emergence of punk zines and mini-comics. The third section, "A New Millenium: Trans Creators, Webcomics, and Stepping Out of the Ghetto," features work from the increasing number of transgender cartoonists, and details the shift in queer comics from queer comics media towards the internet and crossing over into the mainstream.
Reception.
"Publishers Weekly" noted that many of the comics "hit on concerns and experiences that cut to the heart of the human soul, not just the gay one", and concluded that Hall was "quite successful" at gearing the anthology towards a wider audience beyond the LGBT community, "but without softening the edges that define the genre". Writing for "The New York Times Book Review", Glen Weldon felt that "the decision to restrict selections to the Western world is disappointing but understandable", and concluded that "No Straight Lines" was a "useful, combative and frequently moving chronicle of a culture in perpetual transition". Lee Mandelo of "Tor.com" wrote that the book was "a great read, not just for the stories alone but for what they represent together: a history, a genealogy, or LGBTQ writers and artists telling stories that reflect their experiences and knowledge of the world".
Writing for The American Library Association's Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table, Talia Earle called the book "absolutely fascinating, especially in giving the reader a wide variety of topics impacting the GLBT community". Cathy Camper of the Lambda Literary Foundation praised Hall for taking on the "mountainous" task of compiling a historical collection of queer comics, concluding that he "delivered a classic compilation of stories that promises readers of comics everywhere something wonderful to read".
"No Straight Lines" won Best LGBT Anthology at the 25th Lambda Literary Awards. The volume was also nominated for the 2013 Eisner Award for Best Anthology.
Documentary film.
A feature-length documentary film inspired by the book, "No Straight Lines: The Rise of Queer Comics" was completed in 2021, with a world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival.

Fern Shaffer

Fern Shaffer (born 1944) is an American painter, performance artist, lecturer and environmental advocate. Her work arose in conjunction with an emerging Ecofeminism movement that brought together environmentalism, feminist values and spirituality to address shared concern for the Earth and all forms of life. She first gained widespread recognition for a four-part, shamanistic performance cycle, created in collaboration with photographer Othello Anderson in 1985. Writer and critic Suzi Gablik praised their work for its rejection of the technocratic, rationalizing mindset of modernity, in favor of communion with magic, the mysterious and primordial, and the soul. Gablik featured Shaffer's "Winter Solstice" (1985) as the cover art for her influential book, "The Reenchantment of Art", and wrote that the ritual opened "a lost sense of oneness with nature and an acute awareness of ecosystem" that offered "a possible basis for reharmonizing our out-of-balance relationship with nature."
Shaffer is also known for feminist and ecology-themed paintings that critics have described as romantic, dizzying and panoramic, spiritual, and capable of combining the scientific, personal and universal. She has been a long-time activist for women in art through her involvement and leadership at the Chicago alternative art space Artemisia Gallery and work with the national Women's Caucus for Art. In addition to exhibiting work throughout the U.S. and internationally, Shaffer has been active as an arts administrator, public lecturer, and educator.
Life.
Born in Chicago, Shaffer studied art locally, earning a BFA from University of Illinois at Chicago in 1981. She followed with postgraduate work there and at Art Institute of Chicago, before earning an MA in Interdisciplinary Arts from Columbia College Chicago in 1991. In the early 1970s, Shaffer was part of a group of emerging women artists, including Barbara Blades, Carol Diehl, Elizabeth Langer and Sandra Perlow, who studied with painter Corey Postiglione at Evanston Art Center. Blades, Perlow and Shaffer would later be key contributors at Artemisia Gallery.
In the mid-1980s, Shaffer received increasing attention for her painting, and particularly, her performance rituals, with exhibits throughout the U.S. and in Colombia, Germany, Israel, Italy and the United Kingdom. Her work has been featured at institutions including Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago ("Art in Chicago: 1945–1995" survey), Portland Art Museum, Shedd Aquarium, and in solo shows at Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum, Bogotá Museum of Modern Art, and Medellín Museum of Modern Art. Shaffer has received awards from the Andrea Frank Foundation (2000), Nancy H. Gray Foundation for Art in the Environment (1999), and International Friends of Transformative Art (1992).
In addition to her work as an artist, Shaffer has served on the advisory board of New Art Examiner, as Program Director of Humanitas Institute in Chicago, and as a chairwoman in that city's Department of Cultural Affairs. For the past 25 years, she has been Program Director at Selfhelp Home, a senior living community originally founded to help refugees and survivors of the Holocaust find community and rebuild their lives.
Work.
Shaffer has worked in a wide range of media, including painting and drawing, sculpture, installation and performance, most frequently addressing themes of the body, gender, nature and ecology, and the intersections between them.
Painting.
In her early work, Shaffer painted in a minimalist, abstract style influenced by artists such as Barnett Newman. Her first solo show, "Ontology at 36" (1981), however, marked a shift that would continue, toward experimentation with mixed materials, representational elements such as the figure, landscape or symbolic imagery, and more emphatic themes. The "Morphogenic Fields" series (1983)—its title referencing the aura of radiation that emanates from living beings—features the female form, rendered in soul-baring, tenuous outline. Shaffer uses a shifting figure/ground relationship calling to mind the flow of energy in, out and through us, depicting women enveloped within fields of gestural DNA-like marks or packed with radiating color strokes like bursts of energy set against darker voids. Evoking both the personal and universal, these works address women's identity on the threshold of exploring, and perhaps realizing, the possibilities for fulfillment opened up by feminism.
The monumental paintings of Shaffer's "Greenhouse Effect" exhibition (1991) demonstrate a shift in theme, as she employed minimal color-fields to suggest haunted landscapes affected by eco-devastation. Describing them, critic Michelle Grabner wrote, "This ecological commentary combined with Shaffer's choice of scale, interest in color, and seductive mark making evokes the ‘tainted sublime.'" In her "Healing Plants" works (1994–Present), in works such as "Aloe," "Lungwort" or "Gingko" (1994), Shaffer combines "careful study, connection and fine draftsmanship" to create "portraits" of plants that echo Matisse cutouts, and which convey and pay tribute to the endurance, healing powers, and necessity of plants to human survival. Shaffer's recent paintings, "Passenger Pigeons", reflect on the extinction of wildlife species in the modern era.
Performance &amp; Ritual Works.
In 1980, inspired by her interest in Edgar Cayce, Mircea Eliade and Michael Harner, and prompted by ecological concerns shared with her collaborator Othello Anderson, Shaffer began enacting self-designed shamanistic rituals as a form of spiritual intervention. Anderson documented the rituals in sequential photographs that were later exhibited with elements (ceremonial garments and objects) from the performances. Feminist art critic Gloria Feman Orenstein situated Shaffer's work as part of an emerging Ecofeminism movement, describing the rituals as introducing "feminist matristic resonances" intended to create connections and restoration in the sites and communities within which they are enacted. According to Suzi Gablik, Shaffer's "process of creating a shamanic outfit to wear can be likened to creating a cocoon, or alchemical vessel, a contained place within which magical transformations can take place." Art critic Thomas McEvilley related the garments to "an earth mother or fertility-goddess motif," evoking "non-Western or non-Modern identities" in the service of ecological concern. The artists describe the rituals in terms of "energy and thought centered on the equal balance and harmony between Nature, science, and spirit," connecting with the Earth as a living entity whose energy can be reached and unblocked through ritual, prayer and touch, much like acupuncture works on the human body.
The first performance cycle included four rituals, one for each solstice: "Winter Solstice" (1985, at the shores of Lake Michigan); "Spiral Dance" (1986, at Cahokia Woodhenge, the site of an ancient solar calendar); "Forest Cure" (1986); and "Medicine Wheel" (1986). Critic Margaret Hawkins wrote that the "primitive costume and reliance on natural cycles" creates "a mystical, almost pantheistic feel" expressing a "reassuring respect for the ineffable." According to "New Art Examiner"'s Garrett Holg, the cycle "examines the distinctions ‘modern' civilization makes between science and myth, between fact and imagination," while its "displayed objects, like ‘ethnological artifacts' have a powerful and iconographic presence."
Shaffer and Anderson staged later rituals at a beach in the shadow of an Indiana nuclear plant, Big Sur, and in the case of the cycle "Urban Series" (1991), uncharacteristic, litter-strewn, urban vacant lots and rubbish heaps. For those three rituals, designed to initiate environmental healing by evoking archaic mystery and connection, Shaffer donned a garment pointedly fabricated from bubble wrap and other refuse. Between 1995–2003, the artists created "Nine Year Ritual", a cycle of annual healing ceremonies enacted at sites affected by mining, the greenhouse effect or waste material accumulation, including Death Valley, Temagami Island, the head waters of the Mississippi River, Green Point, Newfoundland, and the Cache River Basin Wetlands. In 2015, the documented rituals comprised an exhibition at Chicago's Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum.
Feminism &amp; Artemisia Gallery.
Shaffer worked on issues involving women and art for many years. She was a member and president (1982-1992) of the alternative art space Artemisia Gallery, one of the first women artist collaboratives in the U.S., which was founded in Chicago in 1973 by a group that included Phyllis Bramson, Vera Klement, Susan Michod and Margaret Wharton. During Shaffer's leadership, the gallery featured exhibitions and lectures by Eleanor Antin, Judy Chicago, Ann Hamilton, Barbara Kruger, Betye Saar, Pat Steir and Joan Truckenbrod, as well as discussions with authors and artists such as Vito Acconci, Carol Becker, Suzi Gablik, and Thomas McEvilley.
In addition to her work with Artemisia, Shaffer served on the National Board of Directors for the Women's Caucus for Art (1991-2). In 2003, she was named to the Honor Roll of Feminist Artists by the Veteran Feminists of America, an organization that honors and preserves the history of the accomplishments of women and men in the feminist movement.
Shaffer has lectured on topics including feminist and environmental art, ritual, and alternative art spaces at the Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, Illinois National Organization for Women (NOW) Conference, Midwest Sociologists for Women in Society, University of Wisconsin, Women's Caucus for Art National Conference, the Embassy of the United States Tel Aviv and the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Office, Medellín Museum of Modern Art, and Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, among others. She continues to live and work in Chicago.

In architecture and sculpture, a pluteus (plural "plutei") is a balustrade made up of massive rectangular slabs of wood, stone or metal, which divides part of a building in half; in a church they fulfil the same function as an iconostasis or rood screen, separating the nave from the chancel. They are decorated with frames in relief or richly decorated with figures or geometric motifs. 
One set of examples is the so-called Plutei of Trajan, discovered between the Comitium and the Column of Phocas in the Roman Forum in 1872 and another is the Plutei of Theodota.

Jean, Lady Kennedy

Jean, Lady Kennedy (died 1767) was a Scottish noblewoman. She was the daughter of Captain Andrew Douglas of Mains, Dunbartonshire, and the wife of Sir John Kennedy, 2nd Bt of Culzean, Ayrshire.
In addition to having twenty children of her own, Lady Kennedy was the adoptive mother of Scipio Kennedy, an African slave taken from Guinea as a child.
She married John Kennedy, heir to the baronetcy of Cullean (Culzean), on 28 March 1705. Their first child was born on 26 November 1706, but many of their children died in infancy. Their surviving children included:
Their second son, Thomas, inherited the baronetcy after the death of his elder brother in 1744, and inherited the earldom of Cassillis following the death of John Kennedy, 8th Earl of Cassilis, in 1759. On 29 February 1760, the Court of Session found the right to the estates to be his, and the House of Lords awarded him the title on 27 January 1762. Following the death of David Kennedy in 1792, the baronetcy became extinct but the earldom passed to a distant relative.
The Kennedy family had Jacobite sympathies, and was traditionally involved in smuggling, an activity that continued after the earldom of Cassilis passed into the family. The earl's mother is said to have moved out of Culzean Castle in 1753 because she disapproved of his plans to improve the house and estate.
Scipio was eventually given his freedom, but remained with the family as Lady Kennedy's personal servant. He was left property in her will, and continued in the service of her sons after her death.

Plutei of Theodota

The Plutei of Theodota are two mid 8th century Lombard marble bas-reliefs or plutei from the oratory of San Michele alla Pusterla in Italy. They are now held in the Civic Museums of Pavia. Naturalistic in style, they were produced during the Liutprandean Renaissance. One shows the Tree of Life between two griffins and the other shows a cross and font between two peacocks. 
They are named after Theodota, a Byzantine noblewoman who became the lover of king Cunipert (688–700), who later placed her in the Santa Maria Teodote monastery, also known as Santa Maria della Pusterla (now the Diocesan Seminary for Pavia), near which was later built the oratorio di San Michele.

March 2018 Hong Kong by-elections

The 2018 Hong Kong Legislative Council by-election was held on 11 March 2018 for four of the six vacancies in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo) - the Hong Kong Island, Kowloon West and New Territories East geographical constituencies and the Architectural, Surveying, Planning and Landscape functional constituency - resulting from the disqualification of six pro-democrat and localist Legislative Council members over the 2016 oath-taking controversy. The by-election for the two other seats was not held due to pending legal appeals by the two disqualified legislators.
The pro-democrats and pro-Beijing camp each won two seats in the election. Independent democrat Au Nok-hin replaced Demosistō's Agnes Chow - whose candidacy was rejected before the election - won in Hong Kong Island, and the Neo Democrats' Gary Fan retook his seat in New Territories East, while pro-Beijing nonpartisan Tony Tse, who was defeated in his 2016 re-election bid, regained the Architectural, Surveying, Planning and Landscape seat, and Vincent Cheng of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) caused an upset in Kowloon West by narrowly defeating independent democrat Yiu Chung-yim who lost his seat in the oath-taking controversy, making it the first time the pro-Beijing camp received a greater vote share than the pro-democrats in a geographical constituency since 2000 and the first time a pro-Beijing candidate won in a geographical constituency by-election since 1992.
The vote share of the pro-democracy camp dropped significantly from the traditional level of around 55 per cent to only 47 per cent, with a low turnout of 43 per cent. As a result, the pro-Beijing camp maintained its dominance in the geographical constituencies following the oath-taking disqualification with a one-seat majority.
Background.
The 2016 Legislative Council election saw the emergence of the newly founded localists elected to the Legislative Council, including Sixtus Leung and Yau Wai-ching of the pro-independence Youngspiration, as well as Nathan Law of the Demosistō and nonpartisans Lau Siu-lai and Eddie Chu who ran under the banner of the "democratic self-determination".
On 12 October 2016 the inaugural meeting of LegCo, Sixtus Leung and Yau Wai-ching used the oath-taking ceremony as a platform to protest, by claiming that "as a member of the Legislative Council, I shall pay earnest efforts in keeping guard over the interests of the Hong Kong nation," displaying a "Hong Kong is not China" banner, and mispronouncing "People’s Republic of China" as "people’s re-fucking of Chee-na". Their oath were invalidated by the clerk and the controversy caused a huge backlash among the Hong Kong public. Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying and Secretary for Justice Rimsky Yuen took the unprecedented step of launching a judicial review seeking the disqualification of the duo.
On 7 November, the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) controversially interpreted Article 104 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong to "clarify" the requirements that the legislators need to swear allegiance to Hong Kong as part of China when they take office, stating that "who intentionally reads out words which do not accord with the wording of the oath prescribed by law, or takes the oath in a manner which is not sincere or not solemn" should be barred from taking their public office and cannot retake the oath. As a consequence, the High Court disqualified Sixtus Leung and Yau Wai-ching on 15 November. On 25 August 2017, the Court of Final Appeal rejected a final bid by Sixtus Leung and Yau Wai-ching.
On 2 December, Leung Chun-ying and Rimsky Yuen lodged another judicial review against Nathan Law, Lau Siu-lai, Leung Kwok-hung and Yiu Chung-yim who also added words into or changed their tones when reading the oaths during the ceremony. As a result, the High Court ruled the four pro-democracy legislators were to lose their seats on 14 July 2017.
The government announced the date of the by-election for four of the six constituencies would be on 11 March 2018. Nevertheless, the by-elections of the other seat in Kowloon West and New Territories East after the disqualification of Lau Siu-lai and Leung Kwok-hung would not be held as the duo are seeking for appeal. Lau and Leung were seeking for appeals strategically to avoid the by-election of both two seats in Kowloon West and New Territories East to be held together, which would give pro-Beijing camp the advantage to take at least one seat away from the pro-democrats in each constituency.
Pro-democracy primary.
In order to maximise the chance of pro-democracy camp, the Power for Democracy initiated a co-ordination of the pro-democracy candidates in elections. It held a primary in Kowloon West and New Territories East, where more than one pro-democrats were interested in running from December 2017 to January 2018. The primary was conducted in three parts: telephone polls, a generic ballot vote on 14 January 2018 and voting by parties and civil groups that participated in the primary. The first two parts counted for 45 per cent each, and the last part counted for 10 per cent in the final result.
In Kowloon West, the candidates were Frederick Fung of the Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL), Ramon Yuen of the Democratic Party, Occupy activist Ken Tsang and disqualified legislator Yiu Chung-yim, which Tsang subsequently withdrew from the primary to support Yiu; in New Territories East, the candidates were Gary Fan of the Neo Democrats, Kwok Wing-kin of the Labour Party and former president of the Chinese University of Hong Kong Students' Union Tommy Cheung.
Primary results.
More than 26,000 registered voters cast their ballots in the 14 January primary, 12,438 of which turned out at the three polling stations in Kowloon West and 13,699 turned out for at five polling stations in New Territories East. Yiu Chung-yim and Gary Fan received the most votes in the generic votes as well as the overall scores in the primary, becoming the pro-democracy representatives in the Kowloon West and New Territories East by-election respectively.
After the primary, Frederick Fung, ranked the second in the primary, announced that he was under pressure to withdraw as a backup candidacy as agreed in the primary if Yiu Chung-yim was disqualified by the Electoral Affair Commission. "Someone from the progressive democracy bloc told me that if I ran in the poll, they would definitely send someone as well [to challenge me],” Fung said. “I hope my withdrawal will allow the hatred to dissipate." Progressive democrat legislator Eddie Chu, who earlier commented on facebook warning Fung's chance of winning as voters might refuse to vote for him and therefore the camp should not blindly abide by the agreement, denied he had been the one pressuring Fung to withdraw.
Candidates' disqualification controversy.
Agnes Chow, Demosistō standing committee member, emerged as the party's and the pro-democrats' sole candidate in the Hong Kong Island by-election after Nathan Law's girlfriend Tiffany Yuen reportedly declined to run. Chow fulfilled the age limit of 21 after her 21st birthday on 3 December 2017. She officially announced her candidacy on 14 January 2018. On 27 January, her candidacy was invalidated by the returning officer as she claimed that "the candidate cannot possibly comply with the requirements of the relevant electoral laws, since advocating or promoting 'self-determination' is contrary to the content of the declaration that the law requires a candidate to make to uphold the Basic Law and pledge allegiance to the [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]." The European Union issued a statement warning that banning Chow from the by-election "risks diminishing Hong Kong’s international reputation as a free and open society". The pro-democracy camp supported its backup candidate Au Nok-hin running on behalf of Chow.
Yiu Chung-yim, who was rumoured that his candidacy could be foiled on the basis of National People's Congress Standing Committee interpretation of the Basic Law being applied to the entire term of the current legislature, survived the disqualification. Ramon Yuen, who became the backup candidate after the runner-up in the pro-democracy primary Frederick Fung declared he would not be the backup candidate, initially submitted his nomination amid the rumours, withdrew his candidacy hours afterward after Yiu's candidacy was validated by the returning officer on the last day of the nomination period on 29 January.
The candidacies of two other localists, Sha Tin District Councillor James Chan Kwok-keung and convenor of the Shatin Community Network Ventus Lau Wing-hong who ran in the New Territories East, were also disqualified by the returning officer Amy Chan Yuen-man on the grounds that they had advocated Hong Kong independence, even though Lau had earlier made a declaration suggesting he no longer supported the idea. Chan also claimed that he was never an independence advocate but an advocate of "communism out of Hong Kong."
Results.
Some 904,000 of 2.1 million registered voters in the four constituencies cast their ballots with the turnout rate of 43 per cent, 15 per cent lower than the 2016 general election. The pro-democrats underperformed in the poll, which saw their vote share dropping significantly from the traditional 55 per cent to only 47 per cent. The result in the Kowloon West constituency was a surprise reversal as Vincent Cheng of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) narrowly defeated pro-democrat independent Yiu Chung-yim by a margin of 1.1 per cent. Yiu requested a recount at 5am but only confirmed his defeat in the constituency, which made it the first time the pro-Beijing camp received greater vote share than the pro-democrats in a geographical constituency since the 2000 Legislative Council election in Kowloon East where DAB's Chan Yuen-han and Chan Kam-lam topped the poll with a margin of 2.1 per cent compared to the Democratic Party's Szeto Wah and Fred Li. It was also the first time a pro-Beijing candidate won in a geographical constituency by-election since the 1992 New Territories West by-election. Prior to that, the pro-democrats had never lost in a single-member district direct election in the SAR period. It also continued the pro-Beijing dominance in the geographical constituencies after the oath-taking disqualification with a one-seat majority.
Aftermath.
On 13 March 2018, businessman Wong Tai-hoi of the Taxi Drivers &amp; Operators Association accompanied by former legislator Wong Kwok-hing of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) lodged a judicial review application challenging Au Nok-hin and returning officer Anne Teng Yu-yan, who approved Au’s candidacy to run in the by-election, claiming that Au was ineligible to run because he burned a copy of the Basic Law during a protest against Beijing’s interpretation of the Basic Law over the oath-taking controversy on 2 November 2016. The application was however rejected by the court on 29 March.
In September 2019, Court of First Instance Judge Anderson Chow overturned the returning officers' decision to disqualify Agnes Chow and Ventus Lau in the by-elections respectively, on the basis of that the disqualified candidates were not given any reasonable opportunity to respond to the returning officers' questions which led to their ineligibility. The decisions meant that the winners of the Hong Kong Island and New Territories East, Au Nok-hin and Gary Fan, were not duly elected and therefore lost their seats. Au and Fan appealed to the High Court but was refused to be heard on the ground that the duo had no appeal basis.

Universal basic income in the United States

Universal basic income and negative income tax, which is a related system, has been debated in the United States since the 1960s, and to a smaller extent also before that. During the 1960s and 1970s a number of experiments with negative income tax were conducted in United States and Canada. In the 1970s another and somewhat related welfare system was introduced instead, the Earned Income Tax Credit. The next big development in the history of basic income in the United States came in 1982, when the Alaska Permanent Fund was established. It has delivered some kind of basic income, financed from the state's oil and gas revenues, ever since.
Older history (from Paine and Spence to 1900).
Arguably the first to propose a system with great similarities to a national basic income in the United States was Thomas Paine, in Agrarian Justice, 1796/1797. His idea was that a few "basic incomes" to young people, in their 20s, financed by tax on heritage, was highly needed and also a matter of justice. Shortly after that, in 1797, Thomas Spence outlined a complete basic income proposal.
1900-1960.
In the first half of the 20th century various people in the United States advocated some kind of basic income. There were for example the Louisiana governor Huey Long who called it "Share Our Wealth" and also some followers of Henry George.
1960s and 1970s.
In the 1960s and the 1970s the debate around, and support for, basic income and the related system negative income tax, rose substantially. This debate and interest was highly linked to general debate on poverty and how to deal with it. In 1968, James Tobin, Paul Samuelson, John Kenneth Galbraith and another 1,200 economists signed a document calling for the US Congress to introduce in that year a system of income guarantees and supplements. Milton Friedman endorsed the negative income tax in 1962 and again in 1980, and he connected his support for the negative income tax to support for basic income in an interview with Eduardo Suplicy in 2000.
Martin Luther King, a famous civil rights activist and politician, also gave his support for the idea in his book "", published in 1967. In 1969, Richard Nixon proposed a "Family Assistance Program" which resembled guaranteed income, in that benefits did not rapidly taper with additional earnings by the beneficiaries. Nixon's proposal only applied to families, but extended previous welfare by benefiting more than those without a 'father'. Other advocates from the 1960s and 1970s include Senator George McGovern who called for a 'demogrant' that was similar to a basic income.
From 1968 to 1982, the US and Canadian governments conducted a total of five negative income tax experiments. They were the first major social science experiments in the world. The first experiment was the New Jersey Income Maintenance Experiment, proposed by MIT Economics graduate student Heather Ross in 1967 in a proposal to the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity.
The four experiments were in:
In general they found that workers would decrease labor supply (employment) by two to four weeks per year because of the guarantee of income equal to the poverty threshold.
The 1980s, 1990s and early 2000.
The Permanent Fund of Alaska.
The Alaska Permanent Fund is often mentioned as one of the few existing basic income systems in the world. Since 1982, the Fund has paid a partial basic income to all (permanent) residents averaging approximately $1,600 annually per resident (adjusted to 2019 dollars) from the state's oil production revenues. A prominent figure in the history of the fund is Jay Hammond. He was the Republican governor of Alaska in the 1970s and as such he was concerned that the huge wealth generated by oil mining in Prudhoe Bay, the largest oilfield in North America, would only benefit the current population of the state. Therefore, he suggested setting up a fund to ensure that this wealth would be preserved, through investment of part of the revenue from oil.
2010-2018.
The Green Party of the United States in its 2010 platform advocated for a universal basic income to "every adult regardless of health, employment, or marital status, in order to minimize government bureaucracy and intrusiveness into people's lives."
The debate about basic income, according to Guy Standing, has gone in two directions in the United States in recent years. On the one hand is the introduction of basic income as an alternative to existing social policies, paid from direct taxation, and on the other hand is a discussion about capital funds with basic income-style dividends.
In July 2017, Hawaii State Rep. Chris Lee published a bill to investigate basic income for his state.
American Democratic Politician John Moser ran on a Universal Citizens Dividend as the core focus of his 2018 Congressional campaign.
Andrew Yang and the emergency-basic income of 2020.
Andrew Yang was a presidential candidate for the Democratic Party. He was running against more well-known candidates such as Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren to get the Democratic Party-ticket to run against the Republican candidate in 2020. His flagship proposal was a basic income, which he labels "Freedom Dividend" of 1000 dollars per month to each American citizen over the age of 18. He also had several other proposals, regarding democracy, health and medicine, international affairs and so on, but the focal point of his campaign was basic income. That, in turn, is a proposal which he outlines with the background of the fourth industrial revolution. In other words, the development of automation and artificial intelligence, and how these factors change the job market. According to Yang, the Freedom Dividend's benefits include "healthier people, less stressed-out people, better-educated people, stronger communities, more volunteerism, [and] more civic participation. There's zero bureaucracy associated with it [because there is no] need to verify whether [people's] circumstances change."
Yang argues that automation-driven job displacement was the main reason Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, saying that based on data, "There's a straight line up between the adoption of industrial robots in a community and the movement towards Donald Trump." Yang has said that he became a UBI advocate after reading American futurist Martin Ford's book "", which deals with the impact of automation and artificial intelligence on the job market and economy. He believes UBI is a more viable policy than job retraining programs, citing studies that job retraining of displaced manufacturing workers in the Midwest had success rates of 0–15%.
On March 5, 2020 Andrew Yang started the Humanity Forward movement, a non-profit with the goal of introducing the core ideas that Yang ran on during his 2020 presidential campaign such as Universal Basic Income, human-centered capitalism, and data as a property right. Andrew Yang has already received three million dollars in donations for use in this organization. Humanity Forward will endorse and provide resources to political candidates who champion Universal Basic Income, human-centered capitalism and similar policies. HF will help launch and support projects to display the power and practicality of UBI in real life. Yang intends to push these ideas to the mainstream through podcasts, traditional media, and high-impact events.

Theodota

Theodota (also spelled Teodote or Theodote) was a Byzantine noblewoman, most notable for her association with the Lombard king Cunipert (688-700). The Plutei of Theodota are named after her.
A biography of her appears in Book 5 of Paul the Deacon's "Historia Langobardorum". This calls her "a girl from a most noble Roman [ie Byzantine, probably Ravennese] family". She was noticed by Cunipert's wife Ermelinda in the baths which had been built by Damian of Pavia - the Lombard kings at the end of the 7th century still followed a Byzantine style of living, including bathing. Ermelinda described Theodota's beauty, especially her elegant and ornate long blonde hair. Cunipert did not indicate any explicit interest in the girl but instead immediately organised a hunt outside Pavia and ordered Ermelinda to take part in it with him. However, when night fell Cunipert secretly returned to the city and slept with Theodota - Paul initially states that Cunipert "cum ea concubit" (went to bed with her), leaving it unclear whether it was consensual or not, but later on in Book 5 (Chapter 37) writes "de stupro Theodotae" (about the rape of Theodota). Damian concludes by writing that Cunipert later placed Theodota in a nunnery in Pavia "that was named after her", meaning Santa Maria alla Pusterla, later renamed Santa Maria Teodote.
She married to Grimoald, King of the Lombards (662-671) and had issue:

Hans-Jörg Rheinberger

Hans-Jörg Rheinberger (born 12 January 1946) is an historian of science who comes from Liechtenstein. He was director of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin from 1997 to 2014. His focus areas within the history of science are the history and epistemology of the experiment, and further the history of molecular biology and protein biosynthesis. Additionally he writes and publicizes essays and poems.
Life.
Hans-Jörg Rheinberger was born in Grabs, Switzerland on 12 January 1946. He is the great-grandnephew of the composer Josef Rheinberger and grandchild of the artist and architect . He studied philosophy, linguistics and biology at the University of Tübingen, the Free University of Berlin and the Technical University of Berlin. After completing his magister degree in philosophy (1973) he earned his doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) in 1982 with a dissertation concerned with protein biosynthesis and habilitated 1987 in molecular biology at the FU Berlin. From 1982 until 1990 Rheinberger worked as research assistant and research group superintendent at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin-Dahlem. The following two years he spend as visiting professor at the universities of Salzburg and Innsbruck. After a sabbatical at Stanford University (1989/90 within the program "History of Science"), he was senior lecturer at the Institute for the History of Medicine and Science of the University of Lübeck from 1990 until 1994. Subsequently, Rheinberger was associate professor at the University of Salzburg until 1996.
Since 1996 Rheinberger is scientific member of the Max Planck Society and has been director at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science from 1997 until 2014. Since then he is Emeritus scientific member of the institute. From 1993 until 1994 he has been fellow at the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study. In 2000 Rheinberger taught in the capacity of visiting scholar at the Collegium Helveticum of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, 2006 at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and 2016 at the Northwestern University in Evaston. He is honorary professor at the TU Berlin, member of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, as well as the .
Research.
Rheinberger's primary field of activity within the history of science is the epistemological exploration of the experiment and of the research practices of the natural sciences with focus on the biology of the 19th and 20th century. In his studies he describes "experimental systems" to be the driving forces within the development of the modern natural sciences. He developed his corpus of theoretical categories in dependence to the philosophy of Jacques Derrida and draws many inspirations form the works of Gaston Bachelard.
His main focus is aimed at the "structures of the experiment", which he deciphers by applying reconstructive analysis to the work in laboratories concerned with biological research. In contrast to the common self-image the researching science themselves hold Rheinberger shows that planning and control is less defining the every-day-business of research than improvisation and chance. According to Rheinberger promising "experimental systems" are distinguished by the amount of space the grant an "epistemic thing" to unfold itself. This is, as he puts it, imperative to "deal prodictively the unknown".
The "epistemic thing".
The "epistemic thing" is the object of investigation during the research process, which can develop to become a "technical object" over the course of the investigation, therefore becoming something that can be used to research other "epistemic things". The boundary between "epistemic thing" and "technical object" is not static and identifying something as either or not permanent. Therefore, insight is neither inevitable nor complete. Rheinberger's experiences as a molecular biologist has brought the "materiality of the natural sciences" into the focus of the history of science.

Dorothea Chalmers Smith

Dr Elizabeth "Dorothea" Chalmers Smith "née" Lyness (1874 – 1944) was a pioneer doctor and a militant Scottish suffragette. She was imprisoned for eight months for breaking and entering, and attempted arson, where she went on hunger strike.
Early life.
Born in Dennistoun, Glasgow, Elizabeth Dorothea Lyness graduated from medicine from the University of Glasgow in 1894, and worked at the Royal Samaritan Hospital for Women in Glasgow.
She married Reverend William Chalmers Smith, minister of Calton Church, Glasgow in 1901. They had six children born between 1900 and 1911.
Political Activity.
Chalmers Smith joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1912, but her enthusiasm for extreme militancy was not welcomed by her husband, who believed adamantly that a woman's place was in the home.
Chalmers Smith, alongside artist Ethel Moorhead, attempted to set fire to a house at 6 Park Gardens in Glasgow on 23 July 1913. They were caught red-handed by multiple witnesses. In one room firefighters found matches, firelighters, six flasks of paraffin, candles, and a postcard bearing the words: 'A protest against Mrs Pankhurst's re-arrest'.
The case was tried in the High Court at Jail Square and hundreds of Suffragettes attended the trial. Chalmers Smith and Moorhead both conducted their own defence and refused to plead. Moorhead interrupted the Judge saying "We do not want to hear any more. We refused to listen to you. Please sentence us."
When both women were sentenced to eight-months imprisonment, the women rose from all sections of the court and protested, crying out "Pitt Street, Pitt Street" whilst others starting throwing apples at the Judge and counsel.
Both women went on hunger strike immediately. When they became physically weak they were released from prison under the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act , known as the Cat and Mouse Act, which was introduced in April 1913, and allowed for the re-arrest of prisoners once their health improved.
Detectives were posted on the door of her house to make sure that she did not escape. She managed to escape on occasion by dressing up in her younger sister's school uniform.
Chalmers Smith had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU.
Later life.
Chalmers Smith and her husband divorced after the First World War, it is said due to pressure from the Kirk Session (parish group) at a time that it was difficult for a Church of Scotland minister to do so. She left with her three daughters, but she was not allowed to see her three sons again.
After the Great War, Chalmers Smith worked in the newly established child welfare clinics in Glasgow. She did pioneering work in child-care and raised her daughters to be doctors. She died in 1944, and her silver WSPU Hunger Strike medal was donated to the People's Palace by one of her daughters. These medals were first presented by the WSPU at a ceremony in August 1909.
The Suffragette Oak on Kelvinway was planted in 1918 to celebrate women’s first opportunity to vote in a general election and stands as a memorial to the likes of Helen Crawfurd, Dorothea Chalmers Smith, Jessie Stephen and Frances McPhun.

On the First Principles

On the First Principles ("Greek: Περὶ Ἀρχῶν / Peri Archon"; "Latin: De Principiis)" is a theological treatise by the Christian writer Origen. It was the first systematic exposition of Christian theology.
When Origen was around forty-five years of age, he interrupted his burgeoning program of scriptural exegesis to write Peri Archon. In this work he provided a unified discussion of Christian teachings so that his readers could probe more deeply into the church’s rule of faith and discriminate among conflicting scriptural interpretations that were swirling through Alexandria in the late 220's. After completing this treatise, Origen resumed his biblical scholarship, likely viewing Peri Archon as a detour, perhaps even a necessary one, but nevertheless still a detour from his larger project of scriptural interpretation.
Fragments from Books 3.1 and 4.1-3 of Origen's Greek original are preserved in Origen's "Philokalia". A few smaller quotations of the original Greek are preserved in Justinian's "Letter to Mennas". The vast majority of the text has only survived in a heavily abridged Latin translation produced by Tyrannius Rufinus in 397. Rufinus was convinced that Origen's original treatise had been interpolated by heretics and that these interpolations were the source of the heterodox teachings found in it. He therefore heavily modified Origen's text, omitting and altering any parts which disagreed with contemporary Christian orthodoxy. Jerome was so appalled by Rufinus's lack of fidelity to the original Greek that he resolved to produce his own Latin translation of "On the First Principles" in which he would translate every word exactly as it was written and lay bare Origen's heresies to the whole world. Jerome's translation, however, has been lost in its entirety.
"On the First Principles" begins with an essay explaining the nature of theology. Book One describes the heavenly world, and includes descriptions of the oneness of God, the relationship between the three persons of the Trinity, the nature of the divine spirit, reason, and angels. Book Two describes the world of man, including the incarnation of the Logos, the soul, free will, and eschatology. Book Three deals with cosmology, sin, and redemption. Book Four deals with teleology and the interpretation of the Scriptures.

Flicker (light)

In visual perception, flicker is a human-visible change in luminous flux of an illuminated surface or light source which can be due to fluctuations of the light source itself, or due to external causes such as due to rapid fluctuations in the voltage of the power supply (power-line flicker) or incompatibility with an external dimmer.
Twinkling, also called scintillation, is a generic term for variations in apparent brightness, colour, or position of a distant luminous object viewed through a medium.
Flicker exists for other organisms having different perceptual thresholds.
Light meters and image sensors can potentially detect flicker at much higher frequency bands than human vision. Shutter speeds used in motion photography can interact with high frequency flicker to produce visual artifacts in the captured imagery that betray flicker that would not otherwise be noted.
The spectral sensitivity of the human eye to flicker depends upon the mode of visual perception. Due to the flicker fusion threshold of foveal vision, steady vision can rarely detect flicker above 90 Hz, whereas flicker can be perceived during visual saccades up to or beyond 1 kHz.
Flicker due to mechanical factors such as AC line frequency (typically 50 or 60 Hz) will have a stable frequency structure, whereas the flicker of a damp or failing light bulb will often have a chaotic or erratic frequency structure.
Effects.
Various scientific committees have assessed the potential health, performance and safety-related aspects resulting from temporal light modulations (TLMs) including light flicker. Adverse effects of flicker of include annoyance, reduced task performance, visual fatigue, headache and epileptic attack by photosensitive persons. The visibility aspects of flicker are given in a technical note of CIE; see CIE TN 006:2016. In general, undesired effects in the visual perception of a human observer induced by light intensity fluctuations are called Temporal Light Artefacts] (TLAs).
Root causes.
Light emitted from lighting equipment such as luminaires and lamps may vary in strength as function of time, either intentionally or unintentionally. Intentional light variations are applied for warning, signalling (e.g. traffic-light signalling, flashing aviation light signals), entertainment (like stage lighting) with the purpose that flicker is perceived by people. Generally, the light output of lighting equipment may also have unintentional light level modulations due to the lighting equipment itself. The magnitude, shape, periodicity and frequency of the TLMs will depend on many factors such as the type of light source, the electrical mains-supply frequency, the driver or ballast technology and type of light regulation technology applied (e.g. pulse-width modulation). If the modulation frequency is below the flicker fusion threshold and if the magnitude of the TLM exceeds a certain level, then such TLMs are perceived as flicker. These TLM-properties may vary over time due to aging effects. Component failure within lighting equipment or end-of-life behavior of lighting equipment can also give rise to flicker. Furthermore, external factors such as incompatibility with dimmers or presence of mains-supply voltage fluctuations (power-line flicker) are root causes of flicker.
Flicker can also be perceived from naturally modulated light sources like candle light or a sunlit water surface or it may be experienced while driving along a row of trees lit by the sun. TLMs and resulting flicker can be seen also while driving with a certain speed along a street or through a tunnel lit by lighting equipment positioned with a regular spacing.
Visibility.
Temporal light modulations become visible if the modulation frequency is below the flicker fusion threshold and if the magnitude of the TLM exceeds a certain levels.
There are much more factors that determine the visibility of TLMs as flicker:
All observer-related influence quantities are stochastic parameters, because not all humans perceive the same light ripple in the same way. That is why perception of flicker is always expressed with a certain probability. Detailed explanations on the visibility of flicker and other temporal light artefacts are given in CIE TN 006:2016 and in a recorded webinar “"Is it all just flicker?"”.
Objective assessment of flicker.
Light flickermeter.
For objective assessment of flicker, a widely applied and IEC-standardized metric, the short-term flicker indicator ("P"stLM) is used. This metric is derived from the short term flicker severity metric "P"stV that is applied in the power quality domain for testing electrical apparatus for their potential to cause flicker via voltage fluctuations on the electrical mains network (see the IEC publications IEC 61000-3-3 and IEC 61000-4-15). The short-term flicker indicator "P"stLM is implemented in a light flickermeter which processes the light measured by means of a light sensor. The light flickermeter consists of four processing blocks which include weighting filters to account for frequency dependency of the visibility of TLMs as well as statistical processing to enable assessing a-periodic TLMs. The specification of the light flickermeter and the test method for objective flicker assessment of lighting equipment is published in IEC technical report IEC TR 61547-1.
It is recommended to calculate the value of "P"stLM using a light waveform recorded for at least three minutes. This enables proper assessment of flicker occurring at low repetition frequencies. 
 "NOTE - Several alternative metrics such as Modulation Depth, Flicker Percentage or Flicker Index are being applied. None of these metrics are suitable to predict actual human perception because human perception is impacted by modulation depth, modulation frequency, wave shape and if applicable the duty cycle of the TLM."
Matlab toolbox.
A Matlab light flicker assessment toolbox including a function for calculating "P"stLM and some application examples are available on the Matlab Central via the Mathworks Community.
Acceptance criterion.
The perceptibility scale of "P"stLM (and "P"stV) is chosen such that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a level at which 50% of human test subjects judge the flicker to be both noticeable and irritating (Figure 1).
Test and measurement applications.
The objective light flickermeter can be applied for different purposes (see Figure 2 and IEC TR 61547-1):

Lavinia Malcolm

Lavinia Malcolm "nee" Lavinia Laing (c. 1847 – 2 November 1920) was a Scottish suffragist and local Liberal Movement politician, the first Scottish woman to be elected to a local council (1907) and one of the first women 'mayors' in the UK, as the first female Provost in Scotland in 1913: in the burgh of Dollar, Clackmannanshire.
Early life and entry to politics.
She was born Lavinia Laing in Forres, daughter of an ironmonger and councillor, and granddaughter of a former Provost of Forres and became a teacher in Edinburgh. She appears as a "teacher of drawing" living at 3 Elder Street in Edinburgh's First New Town in 1875.
Lavinia visited Dollar Institution (now Dollar Academy), and fell in love with one of its English teachers, Richard Malcolm FRSGS (1840–1926). Richard was still married to his first wife, Lizzie Halley, when they met. Lizzie died in 1878, which then permitted Lavinia to marry him.
She married him and moved to Dollar. They lived at Burnside House just north of Academy Place. The Malcolms hosted boarders from the school. Their child, Richard, died when he was eight-years-old, and both the Malcolms then entered local political life with Richard becoming Provost first (1896–9). Lavinia was the only woman elected to the council and returned unopposed, then later unanimously elected as provost by her fellow councillors in 1913.
Malcom was also a member of both the local School Board and Parish Council. The Chairman of the former described her as "a most valuable assistant", and the Parish Council Chairman stated that "they could not get on very well without her"
Supporter of women's rights.
Malcolm is one of the first women to be elected lead their town council in the UK prior to 1914, after Elizabeth Garrett Anderson (Aldeburgh 1908), Sarah Lees (Oldham 1910), Gwenllian Morgan (Brecon 1910).
She is stated as the 'most famous' Provost on Dollar community website where her picture in full ceremonial robes appears."She wanted women to have the vote but she was against doing anything militant or violent," said Janet Carolan, the curator of the Dollar Museum who has spent 20 years researching Malcolm's background.Throughout the World War I she served in the Provost role and was one of the first women to attend the national Convention of Scottish Burghs. She was one of the first women to be appointed as a Justice of the Peace.
She campaigned to reduce infant mortality and the underlying causes of poverty and poor sanitation.
She died in Dollar on 2 November 1920 and is buried in Dollar churchyard, close to her home. The grave lies on the north wall at the point where stones are enclosed for safety reasons.
Leaving a legacy.
During her life, Malcolm recognised her own place as a role model for other women.
Speaking in 2007, 100 years after Lavinia Malcolm's election, the then current Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Dollar the Scottish National Party's Keith Brown and the Scottish Labour Party's Sarah Boyack both recognised Lavinia Malcolm's example to women, noting
Sarah Boyack, said she wants to see equal numbers of women and men in politics."There are plenty of women MSPs, there are women committee conveners, women cabinet ministers, but I would like to see more of a balance and particularly more women coming into local government to give a woman's perspective on things."Ten years on the proportion of women represented in local and national government in Scotland has increased to 29% in councils and 35% in the Scottish Parliament (2017).

Medal inflation

Medal inflation is a term used by the media particularly in the United States to describe the increase in the number of medals awarded to the armed forces in recent times and a perceived devaluing of medals because of this. It has been discussed since at least 1979 when a book was published relating to the Vietnam War. The War on Terror and particularly the 2003 Invasion of Iraq saw a resurgence in coverage, as there was a rapid increase in the number of medals awarded by the American forces. There was, however, a significant reduction in the volume of medals as the war entered the counter-insurgency phase.
United States.
Various parts of the American media have discussed the perceived problem of medal inflation; most frequently since the start of the War on Terror in 2001 including articles in the "Huffington Post" (Dorian De Wind), "Newsweek" (Evan Thomas) and the "NBC News" (Michael Moran). It has also been discussed in a 2006 book by Paul Robinson and a 2016 work by Michael P. Kreuzer. Earlier treatments of the subject include a 1979 book ("Crisis in Command") discussing the situation in the Vietnam War and a 1996 article in the "New York Times". The question discussed frequently is whether the medals are deserved or being awarded at too high a rate, leading to "devaluation" of the award.
Historically the US armed forces have relied heavily upon individual commanding officers to apply for and approve medals, leading to significant variability in the criteria required for each award. One critic, Colonel Jack Jacobs, who received the Medal of Honor in Vietnam said, in 2004: "it's an age old problem with the Army and Air Force, too. The authority to approve awards is at a very low level, and that has a tendency to increase their frequency. Plus, there's always a political motive, or component, to giving out awards, to keep morale high and create a positive story for the home front". A counterpoint is that in the modern US military a serviceman's medals serve as his "resumé" indicating his career achievements, rather than serving to show only the most valorous or meritorious service.
Early history.
The United States Army, perhaps conscious of the founding fathers' democratic principles, was sparing with its medals. Some distinguished generals including the Civil War leaders Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman wore few if any medals on their uniform. Indeed, the US Army had no medal to recognise valor on the battlefield until the Civil War when the Medal of Honor was introduced. The Medal of Honor was the only such medal until the US involvement in the First World War when a number of other medals were introduced. Controversy over the number of medals issued dates back to at least the Second World War. During the early US involvement in North Africa two US generals visited the front and issued 60 Legion of Merit medals. These medals criteria should have limited them only to very senior officers and the majority of the 60 issued were outside of the criteria. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt disapproved of this action but did not veto the awards. The Second World War as a whole saw a significant increase in the number of medals issued to individual servicemen.
Later 20th century.
A large number of service awards (for "time served") were introduced following the Second World War, which increased the number of medals servicemen could expect to receive. The Vietnam War brought about the use of military bravery medals as a means of raising force morale. Historians Richard A. Gabriel and Paul L. Savage state that "medal packages" were common in which an officer received a set of medals merely for holding a certain rank or appointment; leading to a reduction in the perceived value of these medals. Later, US General Colin Powell described the practice saying that:
Tim O'Brien, who processed awards in Vietnam for his unit, said of the time: "we dispensed awards – purple hearts, one and the same for a dead man or a man with a scraped fingernail; bronze stars for valor, mostly for officers who knew how to lobby".
One award singled out as an example of medal inflation is the Army Service Ribbon, awarded for completing basic initial training, introduced by the US Army in peacetime in 1981. The 1983 Invasion of Grenada has also been cited as an example: some 8,600 campaign medals were awarded despite only 7,200 troops actually serving in the country. The "New York Times" also notes the awarding of combat medals to seamen of the USS "Vincennes" who shot down a civilian airliner, Iran Air Flight 655, in 1988 and the issue of a Purple Heart wound medal to a paratrooper who suffered heat stroke during the 1989 United States invasion of Panama were controversial. The Gulf War of 1990–91 saw almost 3.5 million US service members awarded the National Defense Service Medal, though the majority remained in the United States during this time.
A study in 1994 showed that there was some disparity between the services with regards the frequency of awards. The United States Air Force issued 287 decorations per 1,000 service members in that year, the US Navy 148 and the US Marine Corps just 70. At the time there was pressure on the Marine Corps to increase the number of medals issued to "catch up" to the other services.
War on Terror.
During the 2003 invasion of Iraq complaints were made in some parts of the media that the number of medals awarded was out of proportion with the danger experienced by the troops and that bravery awards were more likely to be issued to officers than enlisted personnel. Of the 26 Silver Stars awarded for the 2003 capture of Baghdad 4 were awarded to colonels, 11 to captains and just 11 to NCOs, none went to privates; of the 104 Bronze Stars with valor device, 32 were awarded to officers and 72 to other ranks (only 4 of whom were privates) and of the 274 plain Bronze Stars 149 went to officers, 133 to NCOs and just 3 to privates. The Purple Heart, which is awarded automatically for being wounded and so perhaps is more reflective of the danger individual soldiers experience was awarded 88 times, only 10 times to officers, 36 to NCOs and 42 to privates.
The US Air Force was subject to criticism regarding the number of medals awarded during the invasion: some 69,000 medals were handed out, significantly more than the army (who awarded 40,000) despite that fact that army personnel were, in general, posted to more dangerous locations. The ratio of bronze stars awarded per fatality in the US Air Force was 91:1 and in the army 27:1. The US Marine Corps took active steps to limit the number of medals awarded during the invasion and was praised by some at the time for having "kept the inflation in check"; it awarded just three bronze stars per fatality suffered. Some critics noted that the Air Force awards, on average, twice the number of medals per service member that the US Navy does.
A noted critic of medal inflation, Colonel David Hackworth was particularly critical of the air force for awarding the Distinguished Flying Cross to a pilot for a mission which missed its target in Baghdad and killed 16 civilians. He compared this to what would have been needed to receive the medal in the Second World War: "in World War II, when I saw a Distinguished Flying Cross, that meant the guy had made 25 or 30 missions over dangerous places like Hamburg or Berlin. Those places sometimes had 50 percent casualty rates. Now, they give medals out to guys who fly bombers invisible to radar whose bombs miss Saddam and kill civilians in a restaurant. It's an outrage". There were in fact a relatively large number of Distinguished Flying Crosses awarded for the invasion: between its establishment in 1927 and 2002 only 3,300 of the medals had been awarded but between March 2002 and February 2004 463 were approved.
Once the war settled down into the counter-insurgency phase the number of medals awarded decreased significantly. Up until 2009 the rate of Medals of Honor awarded was just 0.1 per 100,000 service members, significantly under the ratio in the Korean War (2.3) and the Second World War (2.9). The reasons cited for this were that the technological development of warfare had reduced the number of face-to-face engagements with the enemy; that the shift by the insurgents towards improvised explosive devices, mortars and sniper attacks away from standard infantry tactics had also reduced the number of traditional engagements and that the awards system had been made more rigorous.
Other countries.
The term has also been used in discussions on the awarding of medals to the British armed forces. Prior to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the British Army had a reputation for rarely awarding gallantry medals, outside of special forces units. The "Telegraph" noted in 2009 that there had been a significant rise in the number awarded since 2003. However, the process relies heavily upon the wording of the commanding officer's medal citation which can lead to variability. As an example the 1st battalion of the Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment was awarded 37 medals (including one Victoria Cross, the nation's highest award for gallantry) for a single tour, but similar units engaged in similar tours in 2003 and 2006 received only a single mention in dispatches.
In the Canadian armed forces, there has been some discontent over the awarding of campaign medals, particularly as there was no means of differentiating between those who served regularly on patrol and those that never left the relative safety of the base. Anne Irwin, a military anthropologist at the University of Calgary's Centre for Strategic and Military Studies, proposed two new awards: a rosette on the campaign medal for those who had been off-base and a combat badge for those who fought. This would be similar to the US Army's practice of awarding the Combat Infantryman Badge, Combat Medical Badge and Combat Action Badge (the latter introduced to solve a similar problem in 2005).

Chu Ki-chol

Chu Ki-chol (, born Chu Ki-bok, 25 November 1897 – 21 April 1944) was a Korean Presbyterian minister and martyr. After having dropped out of Yonhi College due to poor health and being briefly associated with the March 1st Movement for the independence of Korea, Chu attended a faith meeting of . Thereafter, he sought a career in ministry, enrolling first at the Pyongyang Theological Seminary becoming a deacon. Chu was ordained a minister in 1926 and served as one in Pusan, Masan, and Pyongyang.
Chu opposed Shinto practices forced on Korean Christians by the Japanese occupiers. He was first arrested in February 1938 and tortured in prison. Still defiant, the relieved him from ministry and the authorities arrested him three more times. His last arrest was in July 1940. He died of torture in prison on 21 April 1944.
After his death, the South Korean government has given recognition for him, including conferring upon him Order of Merit for National Foundation, Third Class. He was declared in November 2007. Despite him being revered as a Korean nationalist, in his sermons he explained that his actions emanated from his Christian faith.
Early life.
Chu was born to Chu Hyun-sung and Cho Jae-sung on 25 November 1897 in Book-boo-ri, Woong-chung-myun, Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province, Korea. He was the fourth of seven children of a Christian family.
 His birth name was Ki-bok, but he changed it to Ki-chol (, meaning "devotee") to reflect his faith. Chu went to a private elementary school at age eight in Woong-chun-eup in 1904. In 1912 he moved on to Osan School, a hotbed of both Korean nationalism and Christianity that were agitated there by and Cho Man-sik. After graduating in 1916, he went to Yonhi College in Seoul in 1917, majoring in commerce on the advice of his father. In his second year in Yonhi, his sight began to deteriorate and he was diagnosed with cataracts. He was forced to drop out and return to his hometown. In 1919, Chu participated in the March 1st Movement for the independence of Korea. He was elected chairman of the Joseon Youth Corps, representing the Woongjin Youth Activist Group. But after having attended a faith meeting hosted by , and allegedly regaining his sight there, he chose to pursue a different path. He enroll at the Pyongyang Theological Seminary, becoming a deacon. Chu was ordained a minister on 10 January 1926. He served as one at the Cho Rang Church in Pusan, South Gyeongsang Province. During the time of Chu's ministry, Korea was under Japanese occupation and the occupiers . Chu refused, calling the practice out as idolatry. In 1931 Chu organized local protests against the practice in South Gyeongsang Province. From 22 September 1931, Chu was minister at the Moon Chang Church in Masan. From the summer of 1936, he became minister of Sanjunghyun Church in Pyongyang. There he broadened the scope of his campaign against forced shrine visits making it a nationwide movement whose center was Sanjunghyun Church.
He opposed the order to house "kamidana" (miniature Shinto altars) in churches. Chu had a habit of retreating to the mountains to pray. In the summer of 1938 he went to fast on Myohyangsan with two friends. He would also pray on the Moranbong overnight. Chu began to be considered the successor of Gil Seon-ju as the leader of the Presbyterian movement in Korea.
Imprisonment and death.
For his defiance, Chu was arrested in February 1938 and taken into prison, where he was tortured until he was released months later. After his release, Chu defended his views in a sermon called "Determination for Death" in September 1938. In it, he explained that his conviction was based on faith, not nationalism. His opposition was based in his conservative theology and its implications on his thinking about idolatry. That same month Chu was arrested again, briefly, to keep him out of the general assembly of the Korean Presbyterian Church that the Japanese authorities forced to accept Shinto practice. He continued his protest and was subsequently jailed two more times. His time in prison totaled five years. In February 1939, Chu was allowed to pay a visit to his home and his church for three days. During this time, he gave a sermon entitled "My Five Fold Prayer". Although thoroughly conservative in theology, this sermon has been interpreted as a radical nationalist outburst in South Korea.
In August 1940, a Japanese pastor dispatched by the government gave a speech in Chu's Sanjunghyun Church. He claimed that Christians worshiping at Shinto shrines was not a sin. Chu confronted the pastor, embarrassing him greatly. The Japanese retaliated, ordering the to relieve him of his pastoral duties and expel his family from church property. Chu was imprisoned for the last time; the charges were treason and breaching the Maintenance of the Public Order Act. After his death the Sanchonghyon Church was closed down by the Japanese authorities. He was tortured again. Torture left him weakened and he died in Pyongyang Prison's medical ward on 21 April 1944. His last words were "God of my soul, hold me firm." Chu was buried in a public cemetery in Pyongyang.
Legacy.
On 10 July 1968, the South Korean government declared Chu an Honored Patriot. In 1990, Chu was posthumously awarded the South Korean Independence Medal (Order of Merit for National Foundation, Third Class). In 2007, the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs chose him as for November, marking the 110th anniversary of his birth. There is a memorial to Chu at the National Military Cemetery in Seoul, as well as in his native Changwon.

Make Me Feel (Janelle Monáe song)

"Make Me Feel" is a song by American singer Janelle Monáe, released on February 22, 2018 as the lead single from her third studio album, "Dirty Computer". This marks her reunion after a 3 year hiatus. A departure from her longtime songwriting-production team of Nathaniel Irvin III and Roman GianArthur Irvin, Monáe co-wrote the song with Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, Robin Fredriksson, and Justin Tranter. Several critics compared it to the work of Prince, while Monáe herself has stated that Prince helped create sounds for the album, including for "Make Me Feel". It became Monáe's second single as a lead artist to chart on the US "Billboard" Hot 100, debuting at number 99 on the week of March 10, 2018.
Critical reception.
Writing for "Pitchfork", Marcus J. Moore says of Monáe and the song, "The polymath unpacks a rubbery funk tune that recalls the likes of Prince and Sheila E. Her 1980s influences are clear, down to each massive synth line and the feeling of raw sensual energy woven throughout the song." Tatiana Pile of "Spin" wrote, "The single is a high-energy funk song with some reverent similarities to Prince's 'Kiss' ... With this bouncy single, Monáe taps into her unique soul-pop sound to deliver a song reminiscent of past tracks such as 'Q.U.E.E.N.' and 'Dance Apocalyptic'."
Music video.
The single's official music video was uploaded to YouTube on February 22, 2018, the day of the single's release. Directed by frequent music video collaborator Alan Ferguson, the music video features Monáe and actress Tessa Thompson in a nightclub. Referred to by Monáe as an "emotion picture", the video heavily resembles the nightclub and plot shown in the "Black Mirror" episode, "San Junipero". Throughout the video, Monáe is seen flirting with both Thompson and a man; at one point she runs between the two as if she cannot decide which one she wants. Ultimately, she dances with both. Also throughout the video, the colors of the bisexual pride flag are displayed in the overhead lighting, so-called "bisexual lighting". The music video, as well as the song, was praised as a "bisexual anthem."
Writing for "Billboard", Natalie Maher states the video, "takes a more Prince-inspired approach, both musically and aesthetically, with the actress hitting an '80s-esque club with actress Tessa Thompson, and serving some of the best moves and looks we've seen from her. The video also features what seems to be an allusion to Robert Palmer's iconic '80s videos, with Monae playing a similarly white guitar, backed by her own group of funky female dancers."
The video received two nominations at the 35th MTV Video Music Awards in the categories "Best Art Direction" and "Best Editing".
Live performances.
Monáe has performed the song live on "The Voice", "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert", "Austin City Limits", 61st Annual Grammy Awards, and 2019 Lollapalooza.

2-Methylbutanoic acid

2-Methylbutanoic acid, also known as 2-methylbutyric acid is a branched-chain alkyl carboxylic acid with the chemical formula CH3CH2CH(CH3)CO2H, classified as a short-chain fatty acid. It exists in two enantiomeric forms, ("R")- and ("S")-2-methylbutanoic acid. ("R")-2-methylbutanoic acid occurs naturally in cocoa beans and ("S")-2-methylbutanoic occurs in many fruits such as apples and apricots, as well as in the scent of the orchid "Luisia curtisii".
History.
2-Methylbutanoic acid is a minor constituent of "Angelica archangelica" and the perennial flowering plant valerian ("Valeriana officinalis"), where it co-occurs with valeric acid and isovaleric acid. The dried root of this plant has been used medicinally since antiquity. The chemical identity of all three compounds was first investigated in the 19th century by oxidation of the components of fusel alcohol, which includes the five-carbon amyl alcohols. Among the products isolated was a compound which gave a (+) rotation in polarised light, indicating it to be the (2"S") isomer.
Preparation.
Racemic 2-methylbutanoic acid can readily be prepared by a Grignard reaction using 2-chlorobutane and carbon dioxide.
It was the target of the first enantioselective synthesis in 1904 when the German chemist W. Marckwald heated ethyl(methyl)malonic acid with the chiral base brucine and obtained an optically active product mixture. Either enantiomer of 2-methylbutanoic acid can now be obtained by asymmetric hydrogenation of tiglic acid using a ruthenium-BINAP catalyst.
Reactions.
The compound and its enantiomers react as typical carboxylic acids: they can form amide, ester, anhydride, and chloride derivatives. The acid chloride is commonly used as the intermediate to obtain the others.
Uses.
Racemic 2-methylbutanoic acid is a slightly volatile, colorless liquid with a pungent cheesy odor. The smell differs significantly between the two enantiomeric forms. ("S")-2-Methylbutyric acid has a pleasantly sweet, fruity odor while ("R")-2-methylbutanoic acid has a pervasive, cheesy, sweaty odor. The main use of the materials, and their esters, is therefore as flavours and food additives. The compounds' safety in this application was reviewed by an FAO and WHO panel, who concluded that there were no concerns at the likely levels of intake.
Biology.
Since 2-methylbutanoic acid and its esters are natural components of many foods, they are present in mammals including humans.

Shirley Ratcliffe

Shirley Geraldine Ratcliffe (September 1932 – 17 July 2013) was a British doctor and researcher into sex chromosome disorders.
Early life and education.
Shirley Geraldine Elphinstone-Roe was born in Kenya in September 1932. Her parents moved the family to England when she was five, and she was orphaned five years later when both her parents died in the Second World War. She was adopted along with her sister by an aunt in Edenbridge, Kent. When she was 16, she nursed her aunt while her aunt died of cancer. 
She studied at the Royal College of Physicians of London, receiving her license to practice in 1956 under the name Shirley Ratcliffe, as she had married. 
Career.
Shortly after graduation she moved to Edinburgh to join her husband, who was in art school there at the time.
Starting as a specialist trainee paediatrician at Edinburgh's Royal Hospital for Sick Children, she joined the UK's Medical Research Council in 1971 as a clinical scientist and honorary consultant paediatrician. In 1967 the MRC in Edinburgh launched a longitudinal study of infants, in order to determine the prevalence of sex chromosome disorders and to track outcomes of people born with them; the study was launched due to sensational publications claiming that XYY males were doomed to become aggressive and criminal adults. Ratcliffe was part of the study from the beginning and continued with it until it ended in the mid-1990s; it became the focus of her career. In 1987, she moved to Great Ormond Street Hospital's Institute of Child Health due to the expertise of its staff in growth analysis. A summary of the study's findings published in 1999. Her work provided the foundation of contemporary medical understanding of abnormal chromosomes.
Personal life.
Ratcliffe and her husband had two children; she and her husband divorced in 1974. She was active in the Medical Campaign Against Nuclear Weapons movement in the 1980s.
She was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2000, and came out of retirement to serve as a director of the Parkinson's Disease Society Of The United Kingdom from 2005 to 2009. She died 17 July 2013.

Nellie Brown Mitchell was a popular singer in churches in New England, and was at one point the lead soprano at four white churches in Boston. She gave concerts throughout and beyond the New England region. In 1874 she gave a concert at Steinway Hall in New York City. 
In the 1880s, Mitchell toured with the Bergen Concert Company. She also formed her own company, the Nellie Brown Mitchell Concert Company. From 1879 to 1886, she was musical director at Bloomfield Street Church in Boston. She sang at the first meeting of the National Negro Business League, in Boston in 1900. She sang at the funeral of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison in 1879, and was a soloist at the observance of his centennial in 1905.
Mitchell was head of the vocal department at Hedding Academy in New Hampshire. In 1876, she conducted a group of 50 girls in a cantata, "Laila, the Fairy Queen", as part of the Centennial Musical Festival in Boston. After she retired from touring, she taught voice techniques to African-American women students in Boston. In 1909, she organized and hosted the first meeting of the Chaminade Musical Club, for "the leading women musicians" of Boston, named for French composer Cécile Chaminade.
Mitchell also invented the "phoneterion", a device meant to help train proper tongue position for vocal students.
Personal life.
Nellie E. Brown married Charles Lewis Mitchell. He was a disabled veteran of the American Civil War, having lost a foot as a member of the 55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. He was also one of the first two African-American members of the Massachusetts legislature, along with Edward G. Walker. Nellie Brown Mitchell was widowed in 1912, and she died in Roxbury on January 5, 1924, aged 78 years.

Dorothy Charlesworth

Dorothy Charlesworth (1927–1981) was a Roman archaeologist and glass specialist who served as Inspector of Ancient Monuments. She worked within Britain and Egypt.
Early life and education.
Born and brought up in Northumberland, the daughter of John Charlesworth, a county court judge and academic lawyer, Dorothy Charlesworth was educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College and Somerville College, Oxford. She took an interest in the study of ancient glass with the encouragement of Donald Benjamin Harden, for whom she then worked at Oxford and London.
Career.
Charlesworth was appointed by the British Committee on Ancient Glass to undertake the British census of ancient glass, which was completed in 1955 although its publication was prevented by the committee's lack of funds.
In 1965 she joined the Egypt Exploration Society’s excavations at Buto (Tell el-Farâ'în), taking part in each season's excavation until it ended in 1969.
At Buto she supervised the excavation of the furnace site, and published her findings. While in Cairo she recorded the working of a local 'primitive' glass furnace, comparing its functioning with that of a contemporary furnace at Damascus, and with medieval glasshouse furnaces in Britain. In the final year of excavations at Buto she became field director, taking over from Veronica Seton-Williams. Alongside her work in Egypt, she continued to work with Donald Benjamin Harden, publishing a summary of his catalogue for the 1969 British Museum exhibition "Masterpieces of Glass."
Once the excavations at Buto had concluded, Charlesworth focused on her work within Britain. She first held a Leverhulme research fellow at the Museum of London, before serving as Inspector of Ancient Monuments. Under these auspices she directed excavations within northern Britain, notably Carlisle, where she discovered the south gate and rampart of the Roman fort in Carlisle, finally locating the fort's exact position. Here she discovered surviving timbers that could be dated by dendrochronology, and shown to have been felled in the autumn or winter of AD72/3. These offered new evidence in the debate over the chronology of the Roman conquest of northern Britain, which may have been under Petillius Cerialis, or Agricola. At Housesteads she excavated the Commandant's house and the hospital with John Wilkes in the late 1960s and 1970s. She also excavated Carrawburgh fort, Hadrian's Wall turret 51A (Piper Sike) in 1970 34A (West Grindon) in 1971, and 29A (Black Carts). Excavation of Hadrian's Wall at Walton was carried out under her direction in the 1970s.
Charlesworth was one of the founding members of the Association for the History of Glass in 1978, and served as its Secretary from 1979-1981. As well as her expert contributions to the study of ancient glass, she also wrote for a more general readership, contributing to guidebooks, e.g., for the museum at the Roman site of Wall in Staffordshire (1958), Aldborough Roman town and Museum, Yorkshire (1970) and Hardknott Fort (1972), and provided archaeological research for the publication of the Roman Inscriptions of Britain. 
A memorial lecture was held in her name by the Cumberland and Westmorland Archaeological Society in 1982.

Jess Wade

Jessica Alice Feinmann Wade is a British physicist in the Blackett Laboratory at Imperial College London specialising in Raman spectroscopy. Her research investigates polymer-based organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Her public engagement work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) champions women in physics as well as tackling systemic biases such as gender bias on Wikipedia and racial bias on Wikipedia.
Education.
The daughter of two physicians, Wade was educated at South Hampstead High School, graduating in 2007. She subsequently enrolled on a foundation course in art and design at the Chelsea College of Art and Design, and in 2012 completed a Master of Science (MSci) degree in physics at Imperial College London. She continued at Imperial, completing her PhD in physics in 2016, where her work in nanometrology in organic semiconductors was supervised by Ji-Seon Kim.
Research and career.
Wade's research interests are in materials science, chiral materials and circular polarisation. , Wade is a postdoctoral research associate in plastic electronics in the solid-state physics group at Imperial College London, focusing on developing and characterising light-emitting polymer thin films working with Alasdair Campbell and Matthew Fuchter. Her research has been published in scientific journals such as the "Journal of Physical Chemistry C", the "Journal of the American Chemical Society", the "Journal of Materials Chemistry", "ACS Nano," "Advanced Functional Materials", "The Journal of Chemical Physics", "Advanced Electronic Materials",
"ChemComm" and "Energy &amp; Environmental Science". She has co-authored research papers with James Durrant, Henning Sirringhaus, Jenny Nelson, Donal Bradley, and Ji-Seon Kim. , according to Web of Science, she is the first author of four papers and a middle author on another 14. Her research (first author) has been cited 25 times, and her middle author papers have been cited 420 times. Her h-index is 8, and her m-quotient is 1.1.
Public engagement.
Wade has contributed to public engagement to increase gender equality in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. She represented the UK on the United States Department of State funded International Visitor Leadership Program "Hidden No More", and served on the WISE Campaign Young Women's Board and Women's Engineering Society (WES) Council, working with teachers across the country through the "Stimulating Physics Network" (including keynote talks at education fairs and teacher conferences). Wade has been critical of expensive campaigns to encourage girls into science where there is an implication that only a small minority would be interested, or that girls can study the "chemical composition of lipsticks and nail varnish". She estimates that £5m or £6m is spent in the UK to promote a scientific career for women but with little measurement of the results.
Wade has made a large contribution to a Wikipedia campaign that encourages the creation of Wikipedia articles about notable female academics, in order to promote female role models in STEM. Wade has created new Wikipedia biographical articles to raise the profile of minorities in STEM. She told "Chemistry World" in mid-2019 that of the 600 articles about female scientists she has written, 6 have been deleted because of the notability issue. Yet, Wade said, the site has articles about the most obscure sports players and forgotten pop songs. As of February 2020, she had written over 900 biographies on Wikipedia.
Wade coordinated a team for the 6th International Women in Physics Conference, resulting in an invitation to discuss the Institute of Physics (IOP) gender balance work in Germany. She also supports the engagement of school students through school activities and festivals, and the organisation of a series of events for girls at Imperial College London, which she has funded with grants from the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng), the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) and the Biochemical Society. In 2015 Wade won the science engagement activity "I'm a Scientist, Get me out of here!" and received £500, which she used to run a greenlight4girls day in the Department of Physics at Imperial College London. She has also written a children's book on materials and nanoscience called "Nano: The Spectacular Science of the Very (Very) Small". The book is illustrated by Melissa Castrillón and is published by Walker Books.
Wade serves on the IOP London and South East Committee, the IOP Women in Physics Committee and the Juno transparency and opportunity committee at Imperial. She cites her influences as Sharmadean Reid, Lesley Cohen, Jenny Nelson and Angela Saini, particularly her book "Inferior". Her outreach work has been covered by NPR, the BBC, Sky News, "HuffPost", ABC News, "Physics World", "El País", CNN, "Nature", "New Scientist", and "The Guardian".
Wade was interviewed as part of TEDx London Women, held on 1 December 2018. With Ben Britton and Christopher Jackson, she co-authored "The reward and risk of social media for academics" in the journal "Nature Reviews Chemistry".
Gender bias on Wikipedia.
A controversy regarding allegations that insufficient coverage within the English-language Wikipedia is being given to women making contributions to science became widely noted when the 12 April 2019 "Washington Post" published an op-ed entitled "The Black Hole Photo Is Just One Example of Championing Women in Science", co-authored by Zaringhalam and Wade. In part, the article decried that previous discussions among Wikipedia's volunteer editors resulted in the biographical entries originally created by Wade for some female scientists non-inclusion on the website, one from among hundreds of articles on women scientists that Wade had contributed to that time, with perhaps approximately one percent of these submissions declined.
With regard to one such article, Wade had heard about nuclear chemist Clarice Phelps from Kit Chapman, who had been conducting research for his book "Superheavy: Making and Breaking the Periodic Table" (2019) with intention "to make science more accessible. I hope that looking back and seeing this cast and some of the diversity that’s reflected in the past, we can get more diversity in the future." Wade created a short Wikipedia biography of Phelps in September 2018. The deletion of that article on 11 February 2019 led to a prolonged editorial discussion and, approaching a type of dispute discouraged among the website's volunteer administrators, its repeated restoration and re-deletion. "Chemistry World" said: Wade told "Chemistry World" she believes such omissions of scientific researchers from coverage in Wikipedia are regrettable, stating her impression that it accepts entries for even the most obscure popular-media figures. By January 2020, there was a consensus to restore the article, as by then new sources had become available.
Wade gave one of the final lightning talks at the 2021 Wikimania online conference, titled "Science and storytelling: Why "who" we talk about matters".
Publications.
Wade's publications include:
Awards and honours.
Wade has received several awards for contributions to science, science communication, diversity, and inclusion. In 2015, Wade was awarded the Institute of Physics Early Career Physics Communicator Prize and the Imperial College Union award for contribution to college life, and was the winner of the Colour Zone in "I'm a Scientist, Get Me Out of Here", an online science engagement project run by Mangorolla CIC. The next year, Wade received the Institute of Physics's Jocelyn Bell Burnell Medal and Prize for Women in Physics 2016.
In 2017, Wade won the Robert Perrin Award for Materials Science from the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining, and Imperial College's Julia Higgins Medal in recognition of her work to support gender equality. She was invited to the interdisciplinary science conference Science Foo Camp at the Googleplex in California.
In 2018, Wade won the Daphne Jackson Medal and Prize for "acting as an internationally-recognised ambassador for STEM". In December she was named as one of "Nature's 10" people who mattered in science that year. She received an honourable mention in the Wikimedian of the Year award by Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, for her "year long effort to write about underrepresented scientists and engineers on Wikipedia", and the following year was chosen as Wikimedian of the Year by her national chapter, Wikimedia UK.
Wade was awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to gender diversity in science. Her employer honoured her that year with its Leadership Award for Societal Engagement. Also in 2019, Wade was named as the 44th 'Most Influential Woman in UK Tech' by "Computer Weekly". Casio released a scientific calculator bearing Wade's picture in a series of 12 calculators commemorating historically notable female scientists.

Santa Maria Ancillarum (literally "St Mary of the Handmaidens") is a Roman Catholic church in Naples, Italy. Its most notable artwork is "The Birth of the Virgin Mary" by Giacinta Sacchetti (1734).
The origin of its name and the date of its foundation are both unknown. It may derive from the female servants of Mary of Hungary who retired to Santa Maria Donnaregina - they may have moved to live close to her and been granted this church by the Archbishop of Naples. The present Gothic structure dates to the 13th century. Its crossing has ceiling frescoes, as does its high altar. The high altarpiece was the late 15th century "Madonna with Saints Jerome and Christopher", now in the Diocesan Museum.

Lady Griselda Cheape

Lady Griselda Johanna Helen Cheape (20 December 1865 – 12 February 1934) was an anti-suffrage campaigner.
Early life.
Born in Angus, Scotland Griselda Ogilvy and was the sixth child of Henrietta Blanche Stanley and Sir David Graham Drummond Ogilvy, Earl of Airlie.
Family life.
Griselda Ogilvy married James Cheape of Strathtyrum in 1897. They went on to have three children.
Political activity.
She was interested in the care of children and enrolled for nursing at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children Edinburgh. She was also assisted at the Pendlebury Sick Children's Home in Manchester, Dundee Royal Infirmary and the London Temperance Hospital.
The issue of temperance was a cause she promoted and she was active within British Women's Temperance Association (BWTA).
She was prominent in the Scottish National Women's Anti-Suffragette League (WASL), founding the branch in St Andrews in 1909 
The BWTA were pro women's suffrage, however the St Andrews branch where Lady Cheape was president (1909–12) was opposed. In 1913 Lady Cheape formed the 'Beehive'- an anti-suffrage society based in St Andrews. She was the President of the St Andrews Branch of the Scottish League for Opposing Women's Suffrage."Lady Cheape believed that direct political representation would undermine, rather than amplify, the idea of feminine moral superiority. Her opinions may be traced to her strongly evangelical approach to temperance reform that emphasised moral, rather than legal, ‘suasion.’"
Death.
She died in 1934 in London.

Santa Maria di Portosalvo, Naples

Santa Maria di Portosalvo or Santa Maria fuori le mura is a former Roman Catholic church in Naples, Italy. It is situated on via Alcide De Gasperi, at the start of via Marina, near the harbour and outside the city walls.
It was founded by the sailor Bernardino Belladonna, who had escaped a shipwreck and wished to set up a lay congregation with a chapel, consisting of himself and other sailors and shipowners. On 31 May 1554, the cardinal gave him permission to do so and on 1 June, Belladonna, Nardo Calvanico, Annibale De Pronillo and brother Albano, were elected governors of the congregation. The site that they chose for their chapel was originally a narrow peninsula outside Porta di Massa. A few months later, work started on the congregation's chapel, which lasted until 1564. The building was then generally decorated between 1564 and 1565 at the cost of 150 ducats - one master Battista built a spiral staircase in the choir.

Alscot Park

Alscot Park is an English Grade I listed Georgian country house in Preston on Stour, some 3 miles (5 km) south of Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. It was built in a Rococo Gothic style for James West in the early 18th century.
The house itself is built of limestone ashlar to a T-shaped plan with a hipped slate roof and has a two-storey frontage of 7 bays. It stands in 4000 acres of park and farmland, which is Grade II listed and bisected by the River Stour. Several other associated buildings, such as stables and entrance lodges, are also listed. A number of former features of the estate, such as pleasure grounds, an obelisk and a Chinese pavilion have since been lost.
History.
At one time Alscot belonged to Deerhurst Priory in Gloucestershire before ownership passed to Tewkesbury Abbey. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539, it passed into private hands such as the Marriett family. In 1747 the manors of Preston and Alscot, together with the adjacent ones of Whitchurch, Wimpstone and Crimscote, were bought by James West, then secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the MP for St Albans. Pending his retirement from his final post as Secretary to the Treasury in 1762 he created the present house in two stages from an older house on the site. The north wing was remodelled in 1747 and the south wing added in 1762. Stables and a conservatory were added between 1762 and 1766.
A gothic entrance porch was later (1815 to 1820) designed and added to the south front. Gothic lodges at the Stratford Road entrance were built in 1838.
James West the younger, the only son of West and his wife Sarah Steavens, heiress of a wealthy timber merchant, died in 1795, predeceasing his mother. Alscot Park thereby passed to James West the younger's son, James Robert West, who died in 1838 and has passed down in the West family until the present day (2018). Currently occupied by Emma Holman-West and her family, the estate has been developed to house residential properties, offices, studios and industrial space, winning the Bledisloe Gold Medal in 2011 from the Royal Agricultural Society for estate management.

Lakshmi (2018 film)

Lakshmi is a 2018 Indian Tamil-language musical dance film written and directed by A. L. Vijay. The film stars Ditya Bhande as the titular character along with Prabhu Deva and Aishwarya Rajesh in the lead roles alongside a supporting cast including Salman Yusuff Khan and Karunakaran. Produced by Prateek Chakravorty, Shruti Nallappa and R. Ravindran under the banner of Pramod Films and Trident Arts, the film features music composed by Sam C. S. and cinematography by Nirav Shah. The film released on 24 August 2018 on the eve of Varalakshmi Vratam and based on the theme of goddess Lakshmi.
Plot.
Ten-year-old Lakshmi lives and breathes "dance" and dreams of winning the "Pride of Life India Jr." title in the national level dance competition. However, her single mother Nandini detests music and dance. Soon, Lakshmi forms an unlikely bond with the people in a cafe near her school. Though Lakshmi approaches it for the music played in the store, she soon becomes a regular visitor. Vijay Krishna alias VK welcomes her when he becomes impressed by her moves, followed reluctantly by waiter Azhagu. Lakshmi gains VK's sympathy, and he accepts her request for him to help her achieve her dreams with VK posing as her father.
She soon enrolls herself in a dance academy with the help of VK that trains and selects students for the national-level competition. She befriends a lot of the students from the academy and soon gains a good name. Arjun, one of the students, is the son of the dance master Sofia. She soon makes it to the team that represents the academy.
On the day of selections, Lakshmi has cold feet and fails to perform due to stage fright, leading to her team's disqualification. In anger, her dance master Sofia (Arjun's mother) asks her to leave and never return. When VK learns of this, he comes to the selection arena and requests to give Lakshmi another chance. It is revealed that VK was a dancer who had participated in Pride of India in 2005 but could not make up to the finals due to an accident, which led him to a coma. The selections chief, Yusuf Khan, on seeing VK, accepts and makes him an offer that Lakshmi and her team could come on board the competition if he agrees to be the coach for the team with Sofia. Yusuf was often irritated with VK's popularity back in the Pride of India 2005, and his jealousy upon him may have been why he came up with this suggestion, as it gives him a chance to beat VK this time with his own dance team. Krishna agrees to be the coach and is able to help the team. In one of the rounds, the kids in Yusuf's team scatter the stage with pins before VK's team performs. Lakshmi and Arjun star together in the romantic dance but struggle greatly with the rest of their team, due to the pain from the sharp pins. They all manage to complete the dance but have bloodstains all over by the end of it. VK and Sophia seem to be the only ones who notice. They manage to make it to the final round, though in immense pain from the pins.
The opponents who scattered the pins feel guilty and ask for forgiveness. Later when VK's team was training for the final, Nandini comes to the practicing site. As Lakshmi participated without consent, she was angry. Then she meets VK and then it is revealed that VK was Nandini's husband and Lakshmi's father. It was his over-dedication to dance that caused their separation. Angry Nandini then walks out of the place with Laksmi forcefully. Lakshmi tries to return. This ends up in an accident where a vehicle carrying gas cylinders explodes.
Lakshmi is saved from further injuries by VK. However, Lakshmi is rushed to the hospital, where Nandini and VK learn that she has lost her hearing ability. She is not allowed to perform but asks VK why she cannot as it was her hearing she lost and not her legs. She surprises everybody by still arriving on the stage fully in costume, ready to dance. The audience is shocked at how she is able to dance without hearing the music. VK is seen standing in the middle, amongst the audience, mimicking the dance for her. When VK is restrained and unable to mimic the dance movements for Lakshmi, but is surprised to see Lakshmi still dancing. He then notices Yusuf counting the beats for her so she can still dance in time without hearing the music and the children in his team assisting the children in VK's team in holding back the men trying to stop VK from assisting Lakshmi in her dance. In the end, Lakshmi wins the "Pride of Life India Jr." title.

Sant'Antonio delle Monache a Port'Alba

Sant'Antonio delle Monache a Port'Alba or Sant'Antoniello is a former monastery and monastic church on Piazza Bellini in the historic city-centre of Naples, Italy. It is now owned by the University of Naples Federico II.
History.
The "Sant'Antoniello" convent was founded in 1564 by sister Paola Cappellani. The monastery was expanded by annexing the neighbouring palazzo of the Principi di Conca – this closed off the original facade from public access, although the remains of the original doorway are still visible. 
The present 18th-century facade was built at the same time as the building's large two-ramp staircase. After a recent restoration, the monastery was purchased by the University of Naples Federico II. From January 26th, 2009, the convent and attached palazzo became the location for BRAU, the humanities research library of the university.
Interior architecture and decoration.
The architecture and interior decoration of the monastery follow the style, especially thanks to the stucco works completed by Arcangelo Guglielmelli to restore the church in 1684. The church altar is marble, with inset pearl. For a while, the main altar's painting was Bernardo Cavallino's "Santa Cecilia in estasi" but, after several controversies, the work was moved to the Museo di Capodimonte.
On the church's side altars, there are more canvas paintings like "San Giuseppe" by and Ferdinando Castiglia's "San Filippo Benizi". The ceiling depicts a painting of Saint Anthony, completed in the 1700s by an unknown Mannerist. There is also a wooden statue of Saint Michael Archangel from the 18th century.

Bloom Into You

 is a Japanese yuri manga series written and illustrated by Nio Nakatani.
The manga began serialization in the Japanese monthly shōnen manga magazine "Dengeki Daioh" on April 27, 2015, and ended on September 27, 2019. The story follows two female high school students, Yuu Koito and Touko Nanami, and the relationship that develops between them as they learn more about themselves through their experiences together.
The manga was collected in eight "tankōbon" volumes that were first published in Japan between October 2015 and November 2019 by ASCII Media Works under the Dengeki Comics NEXT label.
The volumes were later licensed for English release in North America by Seven Seas Entertainment, and were released between January 2017 and August 2020. An anime television series adaptation by Troyca covering the first five volumes of the manga aired between October and December 2018.
Plot.
First-year high school student Yuu Koito unexpectedly receives a confession from a middle school classmate, and turns him down, not knowing how to feel about such things. She later sees second-year student council member Touko Nanami turning down a confession herself and becomes convinced that Touko's situation might be similar to her own. Upon speaking to Touko, the two begin to bond over their similarities. To Yuu's surprise, Touko suddenly confesses her feelings to her. Yuu is uncertain how to respond, but Touko brushes this aside, telling Yuu that she would be very happy if Yuu were to not fall in love with her in return. Yuu agrees.
Touko declares that she will be running for the position of student council president and asks Yuu to be her campaign manager. To the dismay of Touko's best friend Sayaka Saeki, Yuu accepts the role. Despite both her and Touko being highly nervous, Yuu gives a powerful campaign speech on election day and simultaneously announces her decision to join the student council, resulting in Touko winning the election.
As president, Touko announces her intention to revive the student council play, which has not been performed in seven years. When the student council looks for someone to write a script for the play, Yuu considers that her friend Koyomi Kanou could write it, but does not mention this, wanting Touko to forget about doing the play. However, Sayaka tells Yuu to solicit Koyomi to write the script, and to look into the student council president of seven years ago. Yuu subsequently learns that Touko's older sister Mio was the student council president seven years ago and had been producing a play when she was killed in a traffic accident before its premiere. Yuu realizes that Touko wishes to produce the play in her sister's stead and tries to convince Touko that this is unnecessary, but Touko coldly refuses.
The play's production continues and Koyomi finishes the first draft. The narrative follows an amnesiac girl who must choose which person's view of her is her true self, with the original ending involving the girl choosing to be with her lover. When the student council holds a study camp to practice for the play, professional actor Tomoyuki Ichigaya, a former classmate of Mio's, is brought in to help with the rehearsals. Touko asks him about her sister and learns that Mio was a very different person than who she is now, leaving her conflicted. Concerned, Yuu has Koyomi change the ending to have the protagonist choose to be herself instead of conforming to a specific person's view, believing that this will help Touko come to terms with herself. When the play is performed at the cultural festival, its narrative and Touko's performance are acclaimed by the audience, and the manager of a local theater troupe approaches Touko, asking her to join them and become an actress. She initially declines, but eventually reconsiders and accepts.
Touko thanks Yuu again for her support and reiterates her wish for Yuu to stay with her as she is. However, Yuu has slowly begun to reconsider how she feels towards Touko and abruptly confesses her love. She misinterprets Touko's shocked response as rejection and runs away, causing Touko to realize that she has been overly imposing towards Yuu. Meanwhile, Sayaka speaks with café owner Miyako Kodama, with whom she confides her own romantic feelings for Touko. When the second-years take a class trip to Kyoto, Sayaka formally confesses to Touko. Touko is somewhat surprised but eventually turns Sayaka down, acknowledging her love for Yuu. Although dejected, Sayaka accepts this. Elsewhere, Yuu realizes that she is running away from her problems. Upon Touko's return, the two reconcile, and Yuu openly reciprocates Touko's feelings for the first time.
Over time, Yuu and Touko meet up at various places together and gradually become more emotionally and physically intimate with each other. This culminates when they go bowling together, with the agreement that whoever wins gets to request something from the other. Yuu wins and asks to sleep over at Touko's house. Touko agrees, confessing she had wanted to arrange that as well. On the day, Yuu arrives at Touko's parents' condo, where they spend the evening together. Touko waits as Yuu takes a bath, and when she later comes into Touko's bedroom, they have sex.
Some years later, Yuu and Touko have graduated high school, enrolled in college, and are now wearing rings on their fingers. They reunite with the former student council members to attend the cultural festival at their old high school. As Yuu and Touko reminisce about how their relationship started and reflect on their new lives as adults, they walk off into the night.

On the other hand, she stated that the "best qualities" of the series are challenging and manipulating yuri tropes, especially when it comes to "pure" relationships and against the idea of "transitory same-sex love," stating this idea is countered in the relationship between Sayaka and Touko.

Frisch's law of photography

Frisch's law of photography states that: Any photographer/cinematographer will inherently seek out the format with the least apparent depth of field as his preferred choice.
Background.
In digital photography and cinematography (where there are no film cost implications to increasing the size of the image sensor format) each subsequent format that replaced a previous one has had an increase in size of the sensor, and because of this, less inherent depth of field.
It is named after Swedish cinematographer Adam Frisch, FSF.

"Django Jane" is a song recorded by singer and songwriter Janelle Monáe, released on February 22, 2018 as the second single, alongside "Make Me Feel", from her third studio album, "Dirty Computer". The song features Monáe rapping instead of singing and makes a direct reference to Monáe's debut studio album, "The ArchAndroid". Lyrically, it has many black feminist themes. A music video was released on the same day as the single.
Background.
On February 16, 2018, Monáe revealed her third studio album, entitled "Dirty Computer", through a teaser video released on YouTube. Following up on that announcement, she released both "Django Jane" and "Make Me Feel" as the first two singles from the album.
In an interview with "The Guardian", Monáe stated "Django Jane" is "a response to me feeling the sting of the threats being made to my rights as a woman, as a black woman, as a sexually liberated woman, even just as a daughter with parents who have been oppressed for many decades. Black women and those who have been the 'other', and the marginalised in society – that's who I wanted to support, and that was more important than my discomfort about speaking out."
Critical reception.
Writing for "XXL", C. Vernon Coleman II states, "The track finds JM tapping into a hip-hop vein and seriously going hard with the rap bars. The singer chooses a heavy-hitting track, as the punching bass kicks drive the instrumental."
Music video.
The official music video for the single was uploaded to YouTube on February 22, 2018, the same day as the single's release. The "emotion picture" was directed by Andrew Donoho and Chuck Lightning. In the video, Monáe is surrounded by many women and is shown wearing both a red and green suit. During one scene, she visually references a scene from Sebastián Lelio's Chilean film "A Fantastic Woman". After being asked about Monáe using such a significant scene from his 2017 film, Lelio stated, "I love Janelle Monaé and I love her new song. I don't know if she saw 'A Fantastic Woman' and if the moment with the round mirror between Marina's legs inspired her. But anyway, it's exciting to see it reflected — pun intended — in her new video."
Writing for "Billboard", Natalie Maher states, "Sitting atop a throne, and surrounded by a female army in matching suits, Monae delivers an empowering anthem on "Django Jane." On the track, she confidently raps about gender, race and the intersection of it all: "Remember when they used to say I looked too man-ish, black girl magic, y'all cant stand it." Of course, the video also features mentions of "pussy power," and raised-fist symbolism." C. Vernon Colemen of "XXL" states, "The visual is directed by Andrew Donoho and finds Janelle playing the role of crown-holder as she takes her place on her throne, while surrounded by a group of women who look like they mean business. They later break out into a choreographed dance routine while Janelle spits her bars."

San Pietro in Vinculis, Naples

San Pietro in Vinculis is a deconsecrated Roman Catholic church in Naples. It is sited in the historic city centre on via Sedile di Porto, near via Mezzocannone.
It was built in the 15th century to plans by Angelo Aniello Fiore, though its present appearance reflects its extension in the 16th century by professor Giovanni Lucio Scoppa to house a new school for poor children. It was restored in 1654 according to a plaque behind the high altar. Part of the structure is now private accommodations.

Thomas LeBlanc

Thomas LeBlanc is a computer scientist and academic administrator. He is the President of the George Washington University, a role he assumed in July 2017.
Personal life.
LeBlanc earned a Bachelor of Science in computer sciences from the State University of New York, Plattsburgh. He earned a masters and a Ph.D. in computer sciences from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.
Dr. LeBlanc is a member of the Association for Computing Machinery and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
Career.
Prior to his appointment as President of the George Washington University, Dr. LeBlanc served as the University of Miami's Chief Academic Officer, Chief Budget Officer, Executive Vice-President, and Provost. While at the University of Miami, LeBlanc led the development and implementation of the university's strategic plan. He served as interim President of the University of Miami in 2015. He also led the deans in the design of a $1.6 billion fundraising campaign.
LeBlanc worked with GW as the chair of the evaluation team for GW’s academic accreditation during the 2007-2008 academic year.
Prior to Miami, LeBlanc served as Vice Provost &amp; Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Sciences, and Engineering at the University of Rochester. He was chair of the department of computer science and the Dean of the College Faculty. He is credited with the development of the biomedical engineering department with the University of Rochester Medical Center.
LeBlanc has been widely published in computer science and engineering journals. Dr. LeBlanc has served as principal investigator or co-principal investigator on eight federally-funded research initiatives.
In May 2021, LeBlanc said he would retire from his position at The George Washington University at the end of the 2021-2022 academic year. However, in September 2021, GWU's Board of Trustees Chair Gracie Speights said LeBlanc would step down at the end of 2021, to be replaced by former Washington University in St. Louis Chancellor Mark S. Wrighton.
Controversies.
On February 1, 2020, a video was posted to the George Washington University Overheard Facebook page where a freshman at the university, Sophie Gengler, asked President LeBlanc about divestment from fossil fuels. In the video, LeBlanc admitted for the first time that 3% of the University's endowment is indirectly invested in the fossil fuels industry through buying funds that invest in "whatever they want to invest in" which includes the carbon industry. This, along with other points the president made about the university's relationship with climate change activism and deniers, sparked a student protest and several petitions demanding for the university to divest immediately. At one of the protests, a student was pushed down the stairs of the President's home.
In the same video, LeBlanc criticized majority rule over GW policy by saying, "What if the majority of the students agreed to shoot all the black people here?" Students quickly condemned the president's comments as "racially insensitive" and "thoughtless." The president later apologized, saying "The point I was making – that majority rule should never suppress the human rights of others – was obscured by the example I used...I regret my choice of words and any harm I unintentionally inflicted on a community I value greatly."

Edinburgh College of Medicine for Women

The Edinburgh College of Medicine for Women was established by Elsie Inglis and her father John Inglis. Elsie Inglis went on to become a leader in the suffrage movement and found the Scottish Women's Hospital organisation in World War I, but when she jointly founded the College she was still a medical student. Her father, John Inglis, had been a senior civil servant in India, where he had championed the cause of education for women. On his return to Edinburgh he became a supporter of medical education for women and used his influence to help establish the college. The college was founded in 1889 at a time when women were not admitted to university medical schools in the UK.
Origins.
The College was set up as a result of a dispute within the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women. This had been established in 1886 by Sophia Jex-Blake, who was regarded by many of her students as a strict disciplinarian. When two students, Grace Cadell and her sister Martha, were dismissed in 1888 for a breach of rules, they successfully sued Jex-Blake and the school. Another student, Elsie Inglis, emerged as the leader of a group of students sympathetic to the Cadell sisters and increasingly hostile to Jex-Blake. John Inglis her father had a circle of influential friends, including the Principal of the University of Edinburgh, Sir William Muir. They set up the Scottish Association for the Medical Education of Women, which soon had an impressive list of supporters and financial backers. The first president was Sir Alexander Christison, who was striving to reverse the anti-female stance of his father Prof Robert Christison. The Association rented a large building at 30 Chambers Street, which was well suited to the needs of the College with lecture rooms and laboratories. The College opened in 1889.
College activities.
The College was set up in direct competition to Jex-Blake's Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women, which was to close in 1898. It aimed to prepare the women students for the examinations of the Triple Qualification (TQ) offered by the Scottish medical Royal Colleges. Successful candidates were able to register with the General Medical Council and practice medicine in Britain, throughout much of the then British Empire and in some states of the United States of America. When the Scottish universities allowed women to graduate in medicine, many of the College's graduates were awarded the university degrees of MB, CM until 1899 or MB, ChB thereafter.
In the first session the College had 18 lecturers whose lectures covered the syllabus of subjects required by the TQ. The TQ also required a series of clinical placements in a variety of specialities in approved hospitals. The main teaching hospital, the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, refused to allow women medical students on its wards. Jex-Blake's School of Medicine had arranged clinical teaching at a smaller teaching hospital Leith Hospital, and its wards were therefore not available to the College. The College arranged for its clinical teaching at Glasgow Royal Infirmary where two surgeons, Sir William Macewen and James Hogarth Pringle were ardent supporters of medical education for women.
There was still much opposition to medical education for women and much of the success of the College resulted from the influential supporters of the Scottish Association for the Medical Education of Women. These included the Association's first president Sir Alexander Christison Bt, who ironically was the son of Sir Robert Christison who had been a leading opponent of medical education for women. Among the first Vice Presidents were Dr Robert Craig Maclagan and Sir Robert Philip the pioneer of tuberculosis treatment.
In July 1892 the College had sufficient funds and sufficient influence to have two wards in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh opened to the women medical students of the College at a cost of £700. The students were initially taught in the medical ward by Dr William Russell and Dr (later Sir) Byrom Bramwell and in the surgical ward by Mr (later Professor Sir) Joseph M Cotteril.
The College merged with the School of Medicine of the Royal Colleges of Edinburgh in 1916.
Early lecturers.
At the time of the College's foundation there was still opposition to medical education for women. By choosing to lecture at the College the lecturers were effectively making public their support for women in medicine. Most were young men several of whom would become well known in later life. The first lecturers included:

Novello da San Lucano (c.1435, San Severino Lucano - 1516, Alba Iulia) was an Italian architect and designer, mainly active in Naples.
He was probably born in San Severino Lucano, a fief of the Sanseverino family, for whom he produced most of his designs. He was ordained a brother and studied under Angelo Aniello Fiore as well as taking a trip to Rome. His works include the belltower of San Giovanni in Parco in the town of Mercato San Severino and the restoration of San Domenico Maggiore, Naples.

Morris Seely

Morris Seely (1795–1847) was an American businessman and politician who served on the Ohio Senate, Ohio House of Representatives, and as mayor of Dayton, Ohio. His failed canal project through Dayton's South Park neighborhood came to be known as "Seely's Ditch" or "Seely's Folly" and still has an impact today of projects in the area.
Early life and business career.
Morris Seely was born in 1795. Little is known about his early life, until Seely arrives on public record in a land transfer in 1819.
On April 25, 1827, Morris Seely married Catherine Huffman, the daughter of businessman William Huffman.
That same year, Seely worked as a contractor leading four sections the Miami Canal through Dayton. The terrain proved tough to excavate, and vastly underbid the project.
Following the experience, Seely pursued a new idea: "a new navigable canal through the undeveloped area east of town and east of the new Miami Canal connecting the canal's Mad River feeder from near today's Wayne Avenue to the main line of the canal below town near the Fairgrounds hill."
Much of the land Seely sought to purchase and plat was owned by Daniel Cooper and his estate. The Cooper estate sued, and a land ordeal followed. Eventually parts of the land Seely needed for his project was leased by the state elsewhere, which eliminated the chance for a canal, even though the Ohio Supreme Court later ruled against the Cooper estate. The section that had been dug remained for almost 60 years as nothing more than a drainage ditch, and become known as "Seely's Ditch."
Eventually Seely's work on the ditch led to his financial demise, filing bankruptcy in 1842.
Political career.
Prior to Seely's Ditch, Seely served in the Ohio Senate from 1829 to 1830.
In 1833 Seely won election to the Ohio House of Representatives, where he served one term.
In 1838, Seely joined others as they attempted to shift the path of the first interstate highway, "National Road" (US-40 today), through Dayton instead of directly west to Indiana from Springfield. While the road came close, the committee valued a straight road that would not dip south.
In 1841, Seely was elected mayor of Dayton. He served one month, and resigned.
Death.
Morris Seely died in 1847, at the age of 52.
There are many questions about the location of his grave. By many accounts, he is believed to be buried in single grave purchased by his son, William Morris Seely, across from his wife Catherine who passed away two years earlier. Allegedly this is because Seely's failures did not gain him approval with his in-laws, Dayton's prestigious Huffman family, and they would not allow them to be buried together.

Fever is the seventh studio album by Black Milk, released on February 23, 2018 on Mass Appeal Records. Black Milk went on tour to support the album in April 2018 with dates in Europe and the United States. The lead single from the album was "Laugh Now Cry Later".
Reception.
"Fever" was met with "generally favorable" reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 80 based on 7 reviews. Aggregator Album of the Year gave the release a 78 out of 100 based on a critical consensus of 7 reviews.
Pitchfork described the sound as "something like P-Funk meets the Ummah". 303 Magazine said the album was "so engrossing that it induces a thrill to speak its fresh tracks." Giving it 4/5 stars, the Guardian said "the vibe is gorgeous, featuring guttural but lithe bass and airy whispers of beats". The Detroit Free Press said that it's a "purposeful, progressive leap forward". The Washington Post described it as "pushing the envelope". The 405 suggested that the album was making an early claim for the best hip-hop album of the year. Detroit's Metro Times described "Fever" as "a diverse array of songs full of Hendrix soul and George Clinton funk". PopMatters said that for this album Black Milk "explores a spectrum of influences that includes jazz and electronica to produce a shifting-sand of styles that defy the genre trappings that have often ensnared lesser hip-hop act".

She was nominally a three-decker, but in practice the upper deck was divided into armed sections aft and forward of the unarmed waist, making the upper deck equivalent to a quarterdeck and forecastle. 
She took part in the Battle of Cherchell on 24 August 1665 (as flagship of François de Bourbon-Vendôme, Duc de Beaufort) and in the Battle of Solebay on 7 June 1672 (as flagship of Vice-admiral Jean d'Estrées). She was refitted at Brest from 2 August to 11 September 1683, emerging with 70 guns, and recommissioned in June 1689 as the flagship of "chef d'escadre" Jean Gabaret. She took part in the Battle of Beachy Head on 10 July 1690 (as flagship of Alain Emmanuel de Coëtlogon) and in the Battle of Barfleur on 29 May 1692. Following the latter battle, she was beached at La Hogue where she was attacked and burnt by the English on 2 June 1692

History.
The constituency was created in 1978 from the Mymensingh-2 constituency when the former Mymensingh District was split into two districts: Jamalpur and Mymensingh.
Ahead of the 2008 general election, the Election Commission redrew constituency boundaries to reflect population changes revealed by the 2001 Bangladesh census. The 2008 redistricting altered the boundaries of the constituency.
Ahead of the 2014 general election, the Election Commission reduced the boundaries of the constituency. Previously it had included two union parishads of Melandaha Upazila: Mahmudpur and Shaympur.

Agnello of Naples

Agnello of Naples or Aniello the Abbot (535, Naples - 14 December 596, Naples) was a Basilian and later Augustinian monk. He is venerated as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church, with a feast day on 14 December, the date of his death.
Life.
The first major mention of Agnello is in the "Libellus miraculorum", a 10th-century hagiography by Peter the Sub-Deacon. He was born in 535 in Naples into a rich family of Syracusan origin, possibly related to saint Lucy - his father was Federico and his mother Giovanna. He spent his youth as a hermit in a cave near a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary and then in the church of Santa Maria Intercede, which later became Sant'Agnello Maggiore. He received a wealthy inheritance on his parents' death and used it on works of charity, such as founding a hospital for poor people.
He became more and more popular among the inhabitants of Naples, so much so that they asked him to save the city during the Lombard invasion of 581 - he appeared carrying a banner of the cross to defend the city. He finally left the city to escape his popularity, moving to Monte Sant'Angelo then the village of Guarcino, where he remained seven years and where there is a shrine to him. He later returned to Naples to become an Augustinian monk and then a priest at the monastery of Gaudiosus of Naples, where he finally became abbot and where he died aged 61.
Cult.
The liturgical commemoration occurred on December 14.
The seventeenth-century reliquary bust containing the jaw and throat attributed to Agnello is kept in the cathedral of Naples, inside the Chapel of San Gennaro. He is co-patron of the city of Naples where, according to tradition, he would be buried in the church of Sant'Agnello Maggiore in Caponapoli.
From the saint takes the name of Sant'Agnello a village on the Sorrento peninsula, where among other things there is a church dedicated to him and a statue in the homonymous square.
The popular cult is also found in two Campania proverbs regarding Saint Aniello: '"A sant'Aniello nun tucca' ne forbice 'e ne curtiello" e "A santa Lucia nu passe 'e gallina, a sant'Aniello nu passe 'e pecuriello"' which translates to "'Sant'Aniello doesn't touch scissors or curtains and Santa Lucia doesn't pass the hen, Sant'Aniello doesn't pass the sheep"'. The first refers to a custom in the area according to which pregnant women must not use knives or scissors, because the unborn child could be born mutilated in a limb. The second refers to the length of the day, in fact, according to tradition on December 13, the feast of Saint Lucia, the day gets longer a little, like a hen's step, the next day, the feast of Sant'Aniello, the day advances even more, like a sheep's step.
The cult is also widespread in Cilento, particularly in the town of Rodio, a fraction of the Municipality of Pisciotta, which also venerates it as its patron. On 30 July 2009, the bishop of Vallo della Lucania, Monsignor Giuseppe Rocco Favale, elevated the parish church of Rodio, built by the Knights of Malta in the 15th century, to the dignity of a diocesan sanctuary of Sant'Agnello abbot, particularly aimed at the defence and to the promotion of nascent life. Rodio celebrates Sant'Agnello three times during the year: May 31, a votive festival that commemorates the prodigious cessation of the rain that was destroying the vineyards; August 8, solemn feast, with the participation of pilgrims and emigrants and December 14, liturgical feast. From Rodio the devotion has spread to neighbouring countries that have made statues and celebrate feasts in honour of the holy abbot: Pisciotta (1891), Vallo della Lucania (early twentieth century), Pellare (thirties), Ascea and Ascea Marina (seventies). In 1979, the capital Pisciotta obtained from the competent Roman Congregation that, alongside the ancient protectors Santa Sofia and San Vito, Sant'Agnello was also proclaimed its patron, considered the great devotion of the people to this saint. In Pisciotta, Sant'Agnello is celebrated on 10 August and 14 December.
In Cilento, many bear the name of Aniello or Agnello, or the feminine Anella.
In Tramonti (SA), in the hamlet of Cesarano on the 14th day after the solemn evening mass, the holy procession of the sacred images of Saints Lucia and Aniello or Agnello takes place, up to the locality 'bont e cerz'.

Early life and education.
Ksenzov was born on May 4, 1973 in the city of Zaporozhye of the Ukrainian SSR. He graduated from the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy in 1995 as a radio engineer-researcher. 
Career.
From 1995 to 1997 he worked as a junior researcher at the Central Scientific Research Institute of the Ministry of Defense. In 1997, he started working in the Tyumen region administration, where he consecutively held posts of Chairman of the Communications and Informatization Committee and Director of the Department of Information and Regional Relations.
He was a member of the Board of Directors of OJSC "Tyumen Telecom". In 2001-2004, Ksenzov worked in the company-operator of satellite communications "Gazcom" (since December 1, 2008 — "Gazprom Space Systems") on the positions of Director for External Relations, Deputy Commercial Director and Advisor to the General Director for work with federal and regional authorities and large corporate clients. He was directly involved in the creation and operational service of communication and broadcasting satellites "Yamal 201" and "Yamal-202".
In 2004 became the head of the Licensing department at the Russian Federal Surveillance Service for Compliance with the Legislation in Mass Media and Cultural Heritage Protection (Rosokhrankultura), which at that time was responsible for regulating the media; then he headed Mass Communication Permit Issuing Department at the Rossvyazzyokhrankultura, which was later reorganized into Rossvyazkomnadzor, and then — Roskomnadzor (the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media).
In July 2012 Ksenzov was appointed as deputy head of Roskomnadzor, where he managed Mass Communication Permit Issuing, Control and Supervision Department and Electronic Communications Control and Supervision Department. Ksenzov was responsible for regulating the activities of the media, as well as for control over the Internet, which increased since 2012, including the . In the article-investigation "How Roskomnadzor is Organized", published by the online newspaper Meduza, it is noted that Ksenzov was the main public person at the agency and made the final decision on putting the sites on the block list. With reference to an anonymous source familiar with the situation in Roskomnadzor, the author also mentioned Ksenov's close interaction with the Presidential Administration. This information was corroborated indirectly by the alleged correspondence between Ksenzov and the deputy head of the Office for Internal Policy, , allegedly received from the mobile phone of the latter and published in 2015 by the hacking group Anonymous International.
In early 2016, Ksenzov left Roskomnadzor and became deputy CEO of the “” (NMG), and also joined the board of the Cable Television Association of Russia. Ksenzov worked in NMG until September 2016, then he moved to the position of adviser to the CEO of “Energia-Telecom”, a subsidiary of PAO S.P.Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia. Later, in March 2017, Ksenzov was appointed to the position of Managing Director of the Information and Analytical Support Department of VEB Capital, a subsidiary of Vnesheconombank, retaining his position in “Energia-Telecom”. He is responsible for public and government relations, as well as information and analytical support.
Handball activity.
Ksenzov has a master of sports degree. He started his sports career in the Sports School "Zaporozhalyuminstroy". He played for the reserve team of the USSR Top League handball championship "ZII" (Zaporozhye) and CSKA (Moscow). Then he was a player of the main team of CSKA.
In 2006, together with two-time Olympic champion Alexander Tuchkin and a handball referee Valentin Sinenko, he became the founder of the Moscow Handball Federation. At the same time he was elected president of the Moscow Federation and vice-president of the Union of Handball Players of Russia.

Butterflies (Kacey Musgraves song)

"Butterflies" is a song by American country singer–songwriter Kacey Musgraves from her fourth studio album, "Golden Hour" (2018). It was released on February 23, 2018 alongside "Space Cowboy" as the second single from the album through MCA Nashville Records. Musgraves wrote the song with Luke Laird and Natalie Hemby, and produced it alongside Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk. According to Musgraves, "Butterflies" was co-written with Shane McAnally; however, he was not credited as one its songwriters in the album's liner notes.
Composition.
A "genre-defying" song described as country pop, pop, and disco with a "reggae-fied twang", "Butterflies" departs from the lyrical cynicism expressed in Musgraves' previous songs. With lyrics "[representing] those feelings that you have when you're first meeting somebody and you fall in love".
Background.
The song was written in early 2016 shortly after Musgraves had met singer–songwriter Ruston Kelly. The pair were married in 2017 before filing for divorce three years later. 
Critical reception.
"Rolling Stone" compared the "earnest" lyrics of "Butterflies" to Taylor Swift's work from "Fearless" (2008). NPR compared its sound to Little Big Town, with its production "stepping easily beyond any genre category".
Live performance.
Musgraves first performed "Butterflies" on January 21, 2017 on the radio show "A Prairie Home Companion". In 2018, Musgraves performed the song on "Today" in March, "Austin City Limits" in November, and at the 13th "Billboard" Women in Music event in December. In April 2018, Musgraves recorded an acoustic performance of the song in London to serve as one of the original videos for the Hot Country playlist on Spotify. 
Music video.
The music video for "Butterflies", like the clip for "Space Cowboy", was directed by Courtney Phillips and shot in Mexico City. It was released on May 4, 2018 and shows Musgraves walking around a city at night.
Accolades.
"Butterflies" won the Grammy Award for Best Country Solo Performance at the 61st annual awards ceremony in 2019. 
Chart performance.
On "Billboard" weekly charts, the song peaked at number 32 on the Hot Country Songs chart and number 56 on the Country Airplay chart, spending two weeks on the latter.
Cover versions.
Rock band Hawthorne Heights covered "Butterflies" for their two-track project "Dads of Sad" (2019); Musgraves reacted positively to the emo cover. The song was performed by contestant Cali Wilson on the 17th season of the American music competition series "The Voice".

Phomoxanthone

The phomoxanthones are a loosely defined class of natural products. The two founding members of this class are phomoxanthone A and phomoxanthone B. Other compounds were later also classified as phomoxanthones, although a unifying nomenclature has not yet been established. The structure of all phomoxanthones is derived from a dimer of two covalently linked tetrahydroxanthones, and they differ mainly in the position of this link as well as in the acetylation status of their hydroxy groups. The phomoxanthones are structurally closely related to other tetrahydroxanthone dimers such as the secalonic acids and the eumitrins. While most phomoxanthones were discovered in fungi of the genus "Phomopsis", most notably in the species "Phomopsis longicolla", some have also been found in "Penicillium" sp.

Phomoxanthone A

The mycotoxin phomoxanthone A, or PXA for short, is a toxic natural product that affects the mitochondria. It is the most toxic and the best studied of the naturally occurring phomoxanthones. PXA has recently been shown to induce rapid, non-canonical mitochondrial fission by causing the mitochondrial matrix to fragment while the outer mitochondrial membrane can remain intact. This process was shown to be independent from the mitochondrial fission and fusion regulators DRP1 and OPA1.
Properties and structure.
The phomoxanthones are named after the fungus "Phomopsis", from which they were first isolated, and after their xanthonoid structure, which means they have structures similar to the compound xanthone (pictured on the left). Chemically, the phomoxanthones are dimers of two tetrahydroxanthones, meaning that they consist of two subunits of xanthonoids that have four hydroxy groups each. The two subunits of the phomoxanthones are covalently linked to each other. PXA itself is a homodimer, meaning that it consists of two identical subunits. Both of these subunits are diacetylated tetrahydroxanthones, so two of their hydroxy groups have been replaced by acetyl groups. The position of the link between the two dimer subunits is the only structural difference between PXA and its less toxic isomers phomoxanthone B (PXB) and dicerandrol C: In PXA, the two xanthonoid monomers are symmetrically linked at the position C-4,4’, while in PXB, they are asymmetrically linked at C-2,4’, and in dicerandrol C, they are symmetrically linked at C-2,2’. Otherwise, these three compounds are structurally identical. The phomoxanthones are structurally closely related to the secalonic acids, another class of dimeric tetrahydroxanthone mycotoxins, with which they share several properties. Notably, both the phomoxanthones and the secalonic acids are unstable when dissolved in polar solvents such as DMSO, with the covalent bond between the two monomers shifting between 2,2′-, 2,4′-, and 4,4′-linkage. The two phomoxanthones PXA and PXB can thus slowly isomerise into each other as well as into the essentially non-toxic dicerandrol C, resulting in a loss of activity of PXA over time when dissolved in a polar solvent.
Occurrence.
As natural products, PXA and other phomoxanthones occur as secondary metabolites in fungi of the eponymous genus "Phomopsis", most notably in the species "Phomopsis longicolla". This fungus is an endophyte of the mangrove plant "Sonneratia caseolaris". However, it has also been identified as a pathogen in other plants, such as the soybean plant in which it causes a disease called "Phomopsis" seed decay (PSD).
Preparation.
Both PXA and PXB were discovered in 2001, and their preparation by isolation from "Phomopsis" fungal cultures was described in the corresponding publication. Briefly, a MeOH extract of a "Phomopsis" culture is mixed with H2O and washed with hexane. The aqueous phase is then dried and the residue is dissolved in EtOAc, washed with H2O, concentrated and repeatedly purified by size-exclusion chromatography. The resulting mixture of PXA and PXB is separated by HPLC. A modified method, in which the initial extraction is done with EtOAc instead of MeOH and the drying step is skipped, was described in 2013.
Uses.
Phomoxanthone A was first identified in a screening for antimalarial compounds. It showed strong antibiotic activity against a multidrug-resistant strain of the main causative agent of malaria, the protozoan parasite "Plasmodium falciparum". The same study also reported antibiotic activity of PXA against "Mycobacterium tuberculosis" and against three animal cell lines, two of which were derived from human cancer cells. These findings not only showed that PXA has antibiotic activity against very diverse organisms, but they also sparked further studies that investigated PXA as a potential antibiotic or anti-cancer drug. A later study also reported antibiotic activity for PXA against the alga "Chlorella fusca", the fungus "Ustilago violacea", and the bacterium "Bacillus megaterium". This broad range of activity disqualified it as a specific antibiotic that could be used in the treatment of infectious diseases, however the hope that it could be used as an anti-cancer drug remained. Preliminary results from a study in human cancer cells and non-cancer cells suggested that PXA might be more toxic to the former than to the latter, although results from in vivo studies have not yet been presented.
Aside from a potential medical use, recent findings indicate that PXA might have an application as a research tool in the study of mitochondrial membrane dynamics, particularly non-canonical mitochondrial fission and remodelling of the mitochondrial matrix.
Biological activity.
Since PXA has antibiotic activity against organisms as diverse as bacteria, protozoans, fungi, plants and animal cells including human cancer cells, it has to affect a cellular feature that is evolutionarily highly conserved. A recent study has shown that PXA directly affects the mitochondria by disrupting both their biochemical functions and their membrane architecture. The mitochondria are cellular organelles that are present in almost all eukaryotes. According to the theory of symbiogenesis, they are derived from bacteria and share many characteristics with them, including several properties of their membrane composition.
One of the main functions of the mitochondria is to produce the cellular energy currency ATP through the process of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). OxPhos depends on the mitochondrial membrane potential, which is generated by the electron transport chain (ETC) via the consumption of oxygen. PXA was shown to interfere with all of these functions of the mitochondria: not only does it decrease ATP synthesis and depolarise the mitochondria, but it also inhibits the ETC and cellular oxygen consumption. This sets it apart from uncoupling agents such as protonophores. While these also decrease ATP synthesis and depolarise the mitochondria, they increase respiration at the same time due to increased ETC activity in an attempt to restore the membrane potential.
In addition to this inhibition of the function of mitochondria, PXA also disrupts their membrane architecture. In many cell types, the mitochondria normally form an intricate tubular network that undergoes a constant process of balanced mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial fusion. Treatment with PXA or many other mitochondrial stressors, such as protonophores, causes excessive fission that results in mitochondrial fragmentation. In the case of PXA, however, this fragmentation process was shown to be different from canonical fragmentation, caused by other agents such as protonophores, in several ways: first, it is considerably faster, resulting in complete fragmentation within a minute as opposed to about 30–60 minutes for canonical fragmentation; second, it is independent from the mitochondrial fission and fusion regulators DRP1 and OPA1; and third, while PXA causes fragmentation of both the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and the mitochondrial matrix in wild type cells, it causes exclusive fragmentation of the matrix in cells that lack DRP1. This last feature is especially unusual since no active mechanism for exclusive matrix fission is known in higher eukaryotes. Examination of the mitochondrial ultrastructure revealed that PXA causes cristae disruption and complete distortion of the mitochondrial matrix. It is probably through this effect that PXA induces programmed cell death in the form of apoptosis.
