Scottish limited partnership

A Scottish limited partnership (SLP) is a form of limited partnership registered under Scots law. SLPs have features that give them advantages as investment vehicles and have been criticized for having inadequate anti-money laundering rules. Unlike other UK limited partnerships, SLPs have legal personality, which allows them to hold assets and enter into contracts in their own right.
History.
SLPs are governed by the Partnership Act 1890 and the Limited Partnership Act 1907.
Prior to 2017, the ownership of SLPs was not disclosed in company filings. On 26 June 2017 regulatory changes required that SLPs disclose persons with significant control to Companies House. Changes to the regulations were followed by a significant drop in the number of newly registered SLPs.
Illicit use.
SLPs have been used to launder proceeds from criminal activities worldwide, including the proceeds of a $1 billion heist of major Moldovan banks.
According to Transparency International, “these superficial companies have enabled theft, bribery and organised crime to thrive around the world under the veneer of a legitimate UK enterprise”. 
The investigative website Bellingcat "found SLPs trading in high-risk money laundering areas, operating unregulated trading and gambling websites, a large proportion of identifiable SLPs in business as trade intermediaries... SLPs appearing in the Ukrainian criminal courts, generic websites with no clear details of their trading activities... SLPs for sale online as shelf companies, SLPs involved in political lobbying, and others more directly involved in large scale criminal activity".
Popularity.
SLPs sharply increased in popularity between 2016 and 2017, with a 430% increase in registrations in that time.
They are reportedly popular vehicles for money laundering for criminals from the former Soviet bloc. Due to possessing distinct legal personalities, SLPs have been used as investment vehicles in Lloyd's of London since 1997.
The requirement to file Persons with Significant Control documents from 2017 led to a large drop in the number of new registrations.
Criticism.
Transparency International UK policy director Duncan Hames has criticized SLPs, stating that "money launderers have been attracted to them because of the secrecy and the veneer of legitimacy they offer". MP Alison Thewliss described their reported abuse as "an issue of significant concern for the UK Government and the authorities".

FS Class 103

FS Class 103 was a class of 2-2-2 steam locomotives of the Italian State Railways (FS), originally built for the Strade Ferrate dello Stato Piemontese (SFSP).
History.
Fifteen locomotives were built in Britain between 1853 and 1855 by Sharp, Stewart and Company and were numbered 34 to 38 and 80 to 89 by the SFSP, which used them for the haulage of fast trains. In 1865 they passed to Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (SFAI) which numbered them from 91 to 105. In 1864, SFAI purchased another five units and numbered them 106 to 110. In 1885 they were taken over by Rete Mediterranea (RM) where they were numbered 519 to 538. In 1905, only 5 units survived to be taken over by Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), which registered them as Class 103 with numbers from 1031 to 1035. Since these were obsolete machines, they were all scrapped by 1910.
Technical details.
The driving wheels had a diameter of just under 2 metres and this allowed them to reach 80 km/h. The design of the engines was typically British with outside frames and inside cylinders. The tender carried 7 tons of water and 3 tons of coal. They developed 300 horsepower.

Nemanja Vučić

Nemanja Vučić (; born 11 June 1996) is a Serbian footballer, who plays as a left back for FK Voždovac.
Club career.
Early years.
Born in Kosovska Mitrovica, Vučić moved to Čačak, where he made his first senior appearances with the local club Sloboda in the Serbian League West. While with the club, he made 17 appearances and scored 2 goals between 2012 and 2014. In summer 2014, Vučić moved to Borac Čačak, where he usually played as a member of youth team for the rest of calendar year, after which he moved to Novi Pazar for the spring half of the 2014–15 campaign. As he failed to make any appearance in top tier of the Serbian football pyramid, Vučić left the club after overgrown youth selection and moved to FAP in summer 2015. During the first half of the 2015–16 campaign in the Serbian League West, Vučić collected 11 caps and scored 3 goals for team as a bonus player, being elected for a player of the match once time, in a match against Šumadija 1903. In the mid-season, Vučić decided to leave the club.
Zemun.
At the beginning of 2016, Vučić joined the Serbian First League side Zemun. He made his debut for the club in 2-0 away defeat against OFK Bačka on 12 March 2016. Later, until the end of season, Vučić collected 8 matches at total, earning double yellow card in 25th fixture match against Proleter Novi Sad. At the beginning of 2015–16 Serbian First League campaign, Vučić was usually used as a back-up choice under coach Dragoljub Bekvalac. He made a single appearance in 0–0 draw to Sloboda Užice in the 3rd fixture, replacing Srđan Ajković in 77th minute of the match. Vučić returned to the field in 9th fixture match against BSK Borča, playing the whole matches for the rest of season under coach Milan Milanović. Vučić also scored 4 goals during the second half-season in matches against Radnički Pirot, OFK Odžaci, Budućnost Dobanovci, and Jagodina, contributing to the club's promotion in the Serbian SuperLiga. Vučić made his SuperLiga in opening match of the 2017–18 campaign against Mladost Lučani on 22 July 2017. For the rest of 2017, Vučić noted 18 league and 1 cup appearance scoring 3 goals, against Radnički Niš, Mačva Šabac, and Rad. On 25 February 2018, Vučić had been elected for a player of the match in 1–1 draw to Partizan, realising a penalty kick, which previously extorted in a duel with Luka Cucin. Vučić suffered an injury later in 2018, after which he missed the rest of season.
International career.
Vučić was called into the Serbia national under-20 football team squad in 2017, under coach Milan Obradović. He made two appearances for the team in June same year, in games against Israel and Greece, replacing Jovica Blagojević in both of matches. Vučić got his first call in Serbian under-21 team by coach Goran Đorović in September 2017, after which he was usually used as a back-up choice for Miroslav Bogosavac in the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification. He made his debut for under-21 level selection in away friendly against Qatar on 17 December 2017, scoring own goal on the match.
Style of play.
Standing at 5-foot-11-inches (1.80 m), Vučić is a left-footed footballer who usually operates as a left-back. While in youth categories, he also appeared as a centre-back or defensive midfielder in some occasions, improving sliding tackles and defensive skills. Turning fully professional and coming to the top level of Serbian football, Vučić has been described as a player with more pronounced offensive characteristics, who often breaks through the opponent's middle, but with a slightly worse attitude in defense. Vučić is also an accurate penalty taker. Scoring penalty kicks for Zemun in two successive home victories over Mačva Šabac and Rad in November 2017, Vučić is labelled as a player with strong leadership and influence in the team. Vučić also beat Vladimir Stojković using Panenka style in 1–1 away draw against Partizan.

Alexey Klokov

Alexey Vyacheslavovich Klokov (; born August 2, 1965) is a Russian painter and a member of the Creative Union of Artists of Russia.
Biography.
Alexey Klokov (one of his pseudonyms is Romanov:) was born on August 2, 1965, in the village called , situated in the Moscow region. Raised in the family of the interior designer, in 1982 he graduated from Beloomut Secondary School No. 1 then enlisted in the Ryazan Higher Airborne Command School and served in Russian army until 1984.
In 1985, Klokov became acquainted with the avant-garde master Anatoly Zverev, who turned out to be his first mentor until his death in 1986. Subsequently, Alexey entered the Leningrad Higher School of Art and Industry named after V.I. Mukhina, which he graduated from 1991 as a restorer and artist. From 1991 to 1994 he trained in the workshops at the Hermitage (Saint Petersburg) and the Tretyakov Gallery (Moscow), and from 1994 to 1998 he was engaged in the restoration of Old Russian Art.
Since 2005, he has been developing his own method of visualizing desires, namely ILG-ART (Image, Line, Gold), which is a blend of art, psychology of success and chromo therapy techniques.
He has been a member of the Creative Union of Artists of Russia since 2009.
Work.
Alexey Klokov started his exhibition activity in 1998 and is widely exhibited in Russia, Japan, Austria, Great Britain, Canada and the USA. He creates his paintings without preliminary sketches and the use of a palette-knife, premium art materials, which include Belgian linen, high-quality oils and enamels, high karat gold, gold leafing, antique objects and coins.
Among the characteristic features of the artist, is an open color, a textured stroke and volume. The art critic Stanislav Aydinyan calls him "expressive, intense and a prolific colorist". The works of Alexey Klokov, according to the art critic Alexander Evangely, are associated with the illustration of Jungian ideas; a "balance between abstraction and figurativeness". According to the opinion of the art critic Mikhail Andreev, his style is "dialectic in color".
The most expensive work of Alexey Klokov is the installation of an antique Madeira wine bottle of the early 20th century which incorporates a gold 585 fineness sheet on a background of 19th century French wine barrels. The cumulative weight of the gold amounts to 1546 grams.
Another dimension of the artist is a technique, which he titles "randomness". Klokov believes that at times paints may be dissimilar in their structure and that while involuntarily mixing, they may react and "boil". Knowing this interaction and "the laws of confrontation" of basic solvents, this process can be controlled.
At the Seyhoun Art Gallery exhibition, held in Los Angeles in February 2016, his oils of various genres were presented which included "Harmony of Two", "Spring Solo" and "Autobiography" and other paintings. Following this exhibition, a year later in the spring of 2017 in New York Klokov introduced a new collection of his abstract works entitled "Suggestive Abstract" and "Abstract Moderne".
His paintings are included in the collections of notables, Silvio Berlusconi, Hillary Clinton, the family of Emir of Qatar, Tony Blair, Condoleezza Rice, Madeleine Albright, Boris Johnson, Quentin Tarantino, Emir Kusturica, Patrick Swayze, Paco Rabanne, and Marwan Chatila.
Personal exhibitions.
Alexey Klokov started his exhibition activity in 1998. By 2017, the number of exhibitions totaled 35, among them

Jonathan Comer

Jonathan S. Comer, Ph.D. is a Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at Florida International University. He is currently the director of an interdisciplinary clinical research program called the Mental Health Interventions and Technology (MINT) Program. The MINT program focuses on improving the quality, scope, and accessibility of mental health care. Comer is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association and a leader in the field of clinical child and adolescent psychology. The author of over 140 scientific papers and chapters, he has received early career awards from the American Psychological Association, the Association for Psychological Science, and the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies for his work. His research has been funded by federal agencies (such as the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the National Science Foundation) and by several private foundations and non-profit organizations. He has also received funding from the Andrew Kukes Foundation for Social Anxiety.
Comer received his B.A. from the University of Rochester. He attended graduate school at Temple University where he received his M.A. and Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology with a Concentration in Developmental Psychopathology. Comer completed his clinical psychology internship training at the NYU-Bellevue Clinical Psychology Internship Program and at the NYU Child Study Center in the Child and Adolescent Track. After completing his clinical psychology internship training, Comer completed an NIH-funded Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Child Psychiatry at Columbia University. At Columbia, he also served as Chief Research Fellow in the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.
Research.
Comer’s research examines four overlapping areas of study. First, his work focuses on the development of innovative methods to improve access to effective mental health treatments and services. He conducts research on new technologies (such as video conferencing and mobile platforms) to meaningfully expand the reach of mental health care. He also uses epidemiologic datasets to determine problems in the quality and accessibility of mental health services. Second, he has focused much of his career on exploring anxiety disorders and behavioral issues which appear early in life. Third, he studies the course of disorders that may develop in children and families following certain traumas. He has published extensively, and received media attention, on the impact of the 9/11 terror attacks and the Boston Marathon bombing. Additionally, Comer served as a consultant throughout the federal trial of "United States v. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev". Fourth, Comer’s work in recent years has expanded to study biological markers and neurocircuitry patterns associated with psychopathology and internalizing problems.
Books.
Comer has authored several undergraduate and graduate textbooks and handbooks, including "Abnormal Psychology, 10th edition" (Comer &amp; Comer, 2018) and "The Oxford Handbook of Research Strategies for Clinical Psychology" (Comer &amp; Kendall, 2013).
Professional Roles.
Comer is the President-Elect of the Society of Clinical Psychology (Division 12 of the American Psychological Association). He is also an elected Officer in the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology where he serves on the Board of Directors. Comer is Associate Editor of "Behavior Therapy" and Editor-in-Chief of "the Clinical Psychologist". He also serves as Chair of the Miami International Child and Adolescent Mental Health (MICAMH) conference, an annual interdisciplinary conference hosted at Florida International University that presents evidence-based practices in child and adolescent mental health.

Radcliffe Zoological Laboratory

The Radcliffe Zoological Laboratory was created in 1894 when Radcliffe College rented a room on the fifth floor of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University to convert into a women's laboratory. In the 1880s Elizabeth Cary Agassiz, director of the Harvard Annex (which would become chartered as Radcliffe College in 1894), negotiated for the use of space for her students in the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Prior to the acquisition of this space, science laboratories were taught using inadequate facilities, converting spaces such as bathrooms in old houses into physics laboratories, which Harvard professors often refused to teach in.
Physical space and arrangements.
The laboratory space was converted from an office or storage closet, and was sandwiched between other invertebrate storage rooms. This small space was poorly-lit and often cramped, as this was the only space Radcliffe women technically had access to. In 1908, in response to pressure from Radcliffe administrators to construct a women's restroom, Alexander Agassiz launched an inquiry about which spaces women were occupying within the building. Agassiz rejected the construction of this restroom because it would obstruct light from hallway windows, despite the fact that the closest women's restrooms to the Radcliffe Zoological Laboratory were within the Natural History Museum galleries, two floors below. Agassiz found that, while Harvard men occupied 14 rooms, Radcliffe women were spilling over from their single designated laboratory space into 3 other rooms. Herbert Spencer Jennings highlighted that segregating instruction by gender was challenging due to the limitation of space, noting that
Agassiz felt that the resources within the Museum of Comparative Zoology should not be ceded to Radcliffe, stating that 'it cannot expect us to sacrifice M.C.Z. for its needs in anyway'.
Institutional affiliations and degrees.
Radcliffe did not grant PhDs until 1902. Between 1894 and 1902, multiple students completed all course and thesis requirements for a PhD degree in the department of Zoology, without receiving the title. Margaret Lewis Nickelson studied the nervous system of marine invertebrates, publishing three papers in well-regarded journals. Florence Mayo, Annie Henchman, and Julia B. Platt also conducted original research on topics varying from canine teeth of sheep to the nervous systems of slugs. While zoology courses became standard for Radcliffe students by the early 20th century, the refusal to grant doctoral degrees resulted in very little funding or institutional support for long-term research projects for women. This lack of funding led students such as Fanny Langdon to pursue long daily commutes after she moved in with relatives in Jamaica Plain, five miles away from the laboratory in Cambridge. Edith Nason Buckingham was the first to receive a Radcliffe PhD in Zoology in 1910.

Piano Trio (Fauré)

Gabriel Fauré's Piano Trio in D minor, Op. 120 is one of the composer's late chamber works. The first public performance was given by the pianist Tatiana de Sanzévitch, with Robert Krettly and Jacques Patté, in May 1923 for the Société Nationale de Musique in honour of the composer's 78th birthday. The following month it was performed by the celebrated trio of Alfred Cortot, Jacques Thibaud and Pablo Casals. The work is dedicated to Mme Maurice Rouvier, widow of the former prime minister.
History.
Fauré had retired as director of the Paris Conservatoire in 1920. Although he had been reluctant to do so, it brought him more free time to devote to composition, and his final years were marked by the production of many substantial new works. Jacques Durand, his publisher, suggested in January 1920 that Fauré should compose a trio for piano, violin, and cello, and in April he began work, at first in Paris, and later when staying with friends in Argelès-sur-Mer in the south of France. Work was temporarily halted by an attack of pneumonia, after which Fauré went to his favourite resort, Annecy-le-Vieux, in August, resuming work on the piece. His original plan had been a trio for piano, cello and either a clarinet or violin, but he quickly abandoned the clarinet option and wrote for the classical piano trio.
Fauré wrote to his wife, who remained in Paris, "The trouble is that I cannot work for long at a time. My worst tribulation is a perpetual fatigue." The musical scholar Roger Nichols comments that the composer's fatigue is not detectable in the completed work, except to the extent that "there are no more notes than necessary, according to the well-known Mozartian formula". After returning to Paris Fauré completed the trio in mid-February 1923. The premiere was given at a concert of the Société Nationale de Musique on 12 May by given by three young graduates of the Conservatoire: Robert Krettly, violin, Jacques Patté, cello, and Tatiana Sanzévitch, piano. Fauré was ill, and could not attend. Durand published the work the same year. The Parisian newspaper "Comoedia" commented enthusiastically after the first performance, greeting "a beautiful work that enriches the chamber music repertory". The reviewer praised "the elegant clarity, the equilibrium of thought and the serenity" of Fauré's recent compositions, and commented on the composer's success in playing the most disparate musical ideas off against each other. Fauré was present at the performance the following year, given by the Cortot-Thibaud-Casals Trio.
Structure.
There are three movements:
The playing time of the trio is about 18 minutes.

Dirac matter

The term Dirac matter refers to a class of condensed matter systems which can be effectively described by the Dirac equation. Even though the Dirac equation itself was formulated for fermions, the quasi-particles present within Dirac matter can be of any statistics. As a consequence, Dirac matter can be distinguished in fermionic, bosonic or anyonic Dirac matter. Prominent examples of Dirac matter are Graphene, topological insulators, Dirac semimetals, Weyl semimetals, various high-temperature superconductors with formula_1-wave pairing and liquid Helium-3. The effective theory of such systems is classified by a specific choice of the Dirac mass, the Dirac velocity, the Dirac matrices and the space-time curvature. The universal treatment of the class of Dirac matter in terms of an effective theory leads to a common features with respect to the density of states, the heat capacity and impurity scattering.
Definition.
Members of the class of Dirac matter differ significantly in nature. However, all examples of Dirac matter are unified by similarities within the algebraic structure of an effective theory describing them.
General.
The general definition of Dirac matter is a condensed matter system where the quasi-particle excitations can be described in curved spacetime by the generalised Dirac equation:
In the above definition formula_3 denotes a covariant vector depending on the formula_4-dimensional momentum formula_5 (formula_1 space formula_7 time dimension), formula_8 is the vierbein describing the curvature of the space, formula_9 the quasi-particle mass and formula_10 the Dirac velocity. Note that since in Dirac matter the Dirac equation gives the effective theory of the quasiparticles, the energy from the mass term is formula_11, not the rest mass formula_12 of a massive particle. formula_13 refers to a set of Dirac matrices, where the defining for the construction is given by the anticommutation relation,
formula_15 is the Minkowski metric with signature (+ - - -) and formula_16 is the formula_17-dimensional unit matrix.
In all equations, implicit summation over formula_18 and formula_19 is used (Einstein convention). Furthermore, formula_20 is the wavefunction. The unifying feature of all Dirac matter is the matrix structure of the equation describing the quasi-particle excitations.
In the limit where formula_21, i.e. the covariant derivative, conventional Dirac matter is obtained. However, this general definition allows the description of matter with higher order dispersion relations and in curved spacetime as long as the effective Hamiltonian exhibits the matrix structure specific to the Dirac equation.
Common (conventional).
The majority of experimental realisations of Dirac matter to date are in the limit of formula_22 which therefore defines conventional Dirac matter in which the quasiparticles are described by the Dirac equation in curved space-time,
Here, formula_24 denotes the covariant derivative. As an example, for the flat metric, the energy of a free Dirac particle differs significantly from the classical kinetic energy where energy is proportional to momentum squared:
Here, formula_26 is the cyclotron frequency which is linearly dependent of the applied magnetic field and the charge of the particle. There are two distinct features between the Landau level quantization for 2D Schrödinger fermions (ordinary matter) and 2D Dirac fermions. First, the energy for Schrödinger fermions is linearly dependent with respect to the integer quantum number formula_27, whereas it exhibits a square-root dependence for the Dirac fermions. This key difference plays an important role in the experimental verification of Dirac matter. Furthermore, for formula_28 there exists a 0 energy level for Dirac fermions which is independent of the cyclotron frequency formula_26 and with that of the applied magnetic field. For example, the existence of the zeroth Landau level gives rise to a quantum Hall effect where the Hall conductance in quantized at half-integer values.
Fermionic Dirac matter.
In the context of Fermionic quasiparticles, the Dirac velocity is identical to the Fermi velocity; in bosonic systems, no Fermi velocity exists, so the Dirac velocity is a more general property of such systems.
Graphene.
Graphene is a 2-dimensional crystalline allotrope of carbon, where the carbon atoms are arranged on a hexagonal lattice.
Each carbon atom forms formula_30-bonds to the three neighboring atoms that lie in the graphene plane at angles of 120formula_31. These bonds are mediated by three of carbon's four electrons while the fourth electron, which occupies a formula_32 orbital, mediates an out-of-plane -bond that leads to the electronic bands at the Fermi level. The unique transport properties and the semimetallic state of graphene are the result of the delocalized electrons occupying these pformula_33 orbitals.
The semimetallic state corresponds to a linear crossing of energy bands at the formula_34 and formula_35 points of graphene's hexagonal Brillouin zone. At these two points, the electronic structure can be effectively described by the Hamiltonian
Here, formula_37 and formula_38 are two of the three Pauli matrices.
The factor formula_39 indicates whether the Hamiltonian describes is centred on the formula_34 or formula_35 valley at the corner of hexagonal Brillouin zone. For graphene, the Dirac velocity is about formula_42 eV formula_43. An energy gap in the dispersion of graphene can be obtained from a low-energy Hamiltionain of the form 
which now contains a mass term formula_45. There are several distinct ways of introducing a mass term, and the results have different characteristics. The most practical approach for creating a gap (introducing a mass term) is to break the sublattice symmetry of the lattice where each carbon atom is slightly different to its nearest but identical to its next-nearest neighbours; an effect that may result from substrate effects.
Topological insulators.
A topological insulator is a material that behaves as an insulator in its interior (bulk) but whose surface contains conducting states. This property represents a non-trivial, symmetry protected topological order. As a consequence, electrons in topological insulators can only move along the surface of the material. In the bulk of a non-interacting topological insulator, the Fermi level is positioned within the gap between the conduction and valence bands. On the surface, there are special states within the bulk energy gap which can be effectively described by a Dirac Hamiltonian: 
where formula_47 is normal to the surface and formula_48 is in the real spin basis. However, if we rotate spin by a unitary operator, formula_49, we will end up with the standard notation of Dirac Hamiltonian, formula_50. 
Such Dirac cones emerging on the surface of 3-dimensional crystals were observed in experiment, e.g.: bismuth selenide (Biformula_51Seformula_52), tin telluride (SnTe) and many other materials.
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs).
The low-energy properties some semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers, can be described by a two-dimensional massive (gapped) Dirac Hamiltonian with an additional term describing a strong spin–orbit coupling: 
The spin-orbit coupling formula_54 provides a large spin-splitting in the valence band and formula_55 indicates the spin degree of freedom. As for graphene, formula_56 gives the valley degree of freedom - whether near the formula_34 or formula_58 point of the hexagonal Brillouin zone. Transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers are often discussed in reference to potential applications in valleytronics.
Weyl semimetals.
Weyl semimetals, for example tantalum arsenide (TaAs) and related materials, strontium silicide (SrSiformula_51) have a Hamiltonian that is very similar to that of graphene, but now includes all three Pauli matrices and the linear crossings occur in 3D:
Since all three Pauli matrices are present, there is no further Pauli matrix that could open a gap in the spectrum and Weyl points are therefore topologically protected. Tilting of the linear cones so the Dirac velocity varies leads to type II Weyl semimetals.
One distinct, experimentally observable feature of Weyl semimetals is that the surface states form Fermi arcs since the Fermi surface does not form a closed loop.
Dirac semimetals.
In crystals that are symmetric under inversion and time reversal, electronic energy bands are two-fold degenerate. This degeneracy is referred to as Kramers degeneracy. Therefore, semimetals with linear crossings of two energy bands (two-fold degeneracy) at the Fermi energy exhibit a four-fold degeneracy at the crossing point. The effective Hamiltonian for these states can be written as 
This has exactly the matrix structure of Dirac matter. Examples of experimentally realised Dirac semimetals are sodium bismuthide (Naformula_52Bi) and cadmium arsenide (Cdformula_52Asformula_51)
Bosonic Dirac matter.
While historic interest focussed on fermionic quasiparticles that have potential for technological applications, particularly in electronics, the mathematical structure of the Dirac equation is not restricted to the statistics of the particles. This has led to recent development of the concept of bosonic Dirac matter.
In the case of bosons, there is no Pauli exclusion principle to confine excitations close to the chemical potential (Fermi energy for fermions) so the entire Brillouin zone must be included. At low temperatures, the bosons will collect at the lowest energy point, the formula_65-point of the lower band. Energy must be added to excite the quasiparticles to the vicinity of the linear crossing point.
Several examples of Dirac matter with fermionic quasi-particles occur in systems where there is a hexagonal crystal lattice; so bosonic quasiparticles on an hexagonal lattice are the natural candidates for bosonic Dirac matter. In fact, the underlying symmetry of a crystal structure strongly constrains and protects the emergence of linear band crossings. Typical bosonic quasiparticles in condensed matter are magnons, phonons, polaritons and plasmons.
Existing examples of bosonic Dirac matter include transition metal halides such as CrXformula_52 (X= Cl, Br, I), where the magnon spectrum exhibits linear crossings, granular superconductors in a honeycomb lattice and hexagonal arrays of semiconductor microcavities hosting microcavity polaritons with linear crossings. Like graphene, all these systems have an hexagonal lattice structure.
Anyonic Dirac materials.
Anyonic Dirac matter is a hypothetical field which is rather unexplored to date. An anyon is a type of quasiparticle that can only occur in two-dimensional systems. Considering bosons and fermions, the interchange of two particles contributes a factor of 1 or -1 to the wave function. In contrast, the operation of exchanging two identical anyons causes a global phase shift. Anyons are generally classified as "abelian" or "non-abelian," according to whether the elementary excitations of the theory transform under an abelian representation of the braid group or a non-abelian one. Abelian anyons have been detected in connection to the fractional quantum Hall effect. The possible construction of anyonic Dirac matter relies on the symmetry protection of crossings of anyonic energy bands. In comparison to bosons and fermions the situation gets more complicated as translations in space do not necessarily commute. Additionally, for given spatial symmetries, the group structure describing the anyon strongly depends on the specific phase of the anyon interchange. For example, for bosons, a rotation of a particle about 2 i.e., 360formula_31, will not change its wave function. For fermions, a rotation of a particle about 2, will contribute a factor of formula_68 to its wave function, whereas a 4 rotation, i.e., a rotation about 720formula_31, will give the same wave function as before. For anyons, an even higher degree of rotation can be necessary, e.g., 6, 8, etc., to leave the wave function invariant.

Harbans Lall Gulati

Harbans Lall Gulati (c. 1896 – 13 June 1967) was an Indian-born physician living in London, who was a councillor for both the Conservative and Labour parties. After the Second World War he took a special interest in the effect of rationing on the health of the population and was an active campaigner for the extension of mobile canteen services to older people who could not queue for rations. He had a special interest in ophthalmology and worked as a general practitioner in Battersea, London for over four decades.
Early life.
Gulati, known popularly as "Lall", was born around 1896 in Shaipur, near Lahore, Punjab, India. His exact date of birth is uncertain. He was the tenth son of Dola Ram Gulati and he had one younger sister.
Career.
In 1916, Gulati became a medical officer in the Indian Medical Service after completing his medical training in Lahore. In 1919, he was in Amritsar at the time of the Amritsar massacre. In 1920, for reasons unknown, he worked his passage to the United Kingdom where he arrived in Liverpool penniless and walked to London. His qualifications were not recognised in the UK and therefore he repeated his further education and medical training at Charing Cross Hospital. Friendless and without money, he did unskilled work at night to pay for his studies. Eventually qualifying with LRCP and MRCP in 1926, he entered general practice in the largely working-class district of Battersea in London.
Gulati was an active member of the St John and Red Cross organisations. He campaigned to extend mobile canteen services to older people who could not queue for rations in post-war Britain. He was later, in addition, closely connected with the Royal Westminster Ophthalmic Hospital after passing the diploma in ophthalmic medicine and surgery in 1945.
Politics.
In 1934, Gulati was elected a councillor for the Conservative Party. However, he resigned from the party in 1947 because of their lack of support for the National Health Service He was a member of the Food Control Committee, where he was concerned about post-war rationing effects on the health of the population and he joined the Socialist Medical Association and the Labour Party, becoming a Labour member of the London County Council for Battersea South and later standing unsuccessfully for parliament. He was a magistrate and a freemason. As an active member of the committee of the Indian YMCA in London, he witnessed its replanning and building.
Family and personal.
Gulati married Norah Louisa Knobel on 1 August 1931, at St Michael's Church, Battersea. They had two sons and two daughters, one of whom died at the age of four in 1938. His elder son also became a doctor, specializing in orthopedics. His younger son is a solicitor, and followed his father into local politics, becoming mayor of Reigate &amp; Banstead in 1984. His granddaughter, Anita Gulati, attributed her grandfather's resilience partly to meditation, saying: "my grandfather used to close his consultation room door for 20 minutes to meditate".
Death and legacy.
He died suddenly on 13 June 1967 at the age of 70.
Following an interview with his son, Gulati's story was mentioned in Julian M. Simpson's "Migrant architects of the NHS; South Asian doctors and the reinvention of British general practice (1940s-1980s)", and used to show how imperial legacies and medical migration shaped the UK's healthcare in the first four decades following the founding of the NHS.

Toronto Maple Leafs in popular culture

The National Hockey League (NHL)'s Toronto Maple Leafs has been the point of subject for a number of media in Canadian popular culture, including artworks, books, novels, and songs. 
Film.
References to the Toronto Maple Leafs have been made typically in association with the city of Toronto, such as the case in the beginning of the 2010 spy film "Fair Game". During the scene, CIA agent Valerie Plame was being questioned by a suspicious weapons trafficker. He asks her if she is an American, and after responding that she is Canadian, he asks her about the Leafs. She replies that she is not a fan.
The rivalry between the Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens was also featured in the National Film Board of Canada's adaptation of "The Hockey Sweater" by Roch Carrier. Completed a year after the book's publication, the National Film Board of Canada adapted the story into a ten-minute animated short film called "The Sweater". It was animated by Sheldon Cohen and voiced by Carrier. The film became one of the National Film Board's most popular works and has won numerous awards. It was named the Best Animated Film at the 1981 British Academy Film Awards.
Another film where the hockey club was heavily featured was in "Face-Off", a Canadian film about a rookie Maple Leafs player and his romance with a musician. The film featured several players from the NHL, including Bobby Orr, George Armstrong, and Gordie Howe. The 1993 film "Gross Misconduct" focused on the life of former Maple Leafs left wing Brian Spencer. The hockey club was also featured in the 2006 television documentary series "", by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
Comedian Mike Myers, a fan, often included references and even an entire plot line in his films. In "Austin Powers in Goldmember", the ticker below the news item on a television reads, "Maple Leafs win Stanley Cup". In another scene, the character Mini-Me wears a Maple Leafs sweater. In addition to the references included in several films, the Maple Leafs also played a central role in Myers' 2008 film "The Love Guru", where he played a guru hired to help the Maple Leafs' star player.
Literature.
References to the Leafs in literature includes Foster Hewitt juvenile hockey novel, "He Shoots, He Scores!". Published in 1949, it featured the members of the team, including actual managers and players. In 1963, Scott Young wrote "A Boy at the Leafs' Camp", a children's book giving a behind-the-scenes insight into the sport.
Several books concerning the Maple Leafs have been written, and later readapted into film. In 1971, Young and George Robertson co-wrote an adult hockey-romance novel, "Face-off", about the experiences of a star rookie player, Billy Duke, with the Leafs. The novel became a movie in 1971 with Art Hindle as Billy Duke. The film featured many of the players. Jim McKenny, body-doubled for Hindle for the on-ice action scenes because of his resemblance to Hindle. Owner Ballard had a part as the team doctor.
In 1979, Roch Carrier wrote the short story "The Hockey Sweater" about a Montreal Canadiens fan who is mistakenly sent a sweater of their rival, the Maple Leafs. Originally published in French as "Une abominable feuille d'érable sur la glace" ("An abominable maple leaf on the ice"), it referred to the Maple Leafs sweater a mother forced her son to wear. The boy is forced to weat the sweater and faces persecution of his peers and coach, also fans of the Canadiens. The boy is presumably based on Carrier himself when he was young. In 1980, the story was turned into an animated short by the National Film Board of Canada. An excerpt of the book is featured on the Canadian five-dollar Canadian Journey bills, a series of banknotes issued from 2002 to 2013.
Radio shows.
In 1946, the comedy team of Wayne and Shuster performed a sketch on their CBC radio program in which the imaginary hockey team, the Mimico Mice, competed against the Leafs. Foster Hewitt provided the play-by-play of the game, with real player names used for the Leafs and Wayne and Shuster voiced the entire Mimico team.
Song.
In the video for the hit Leo Sayer song “When I Need You” (1976), he walks on the beach in Brighton, U.K. wearing a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater under his half done-up jacket. In 1990 live videos for the song "F*!#in' Up", Neil Young sports a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey. In 1992, Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip released the song "Fifty Mission Cap", which memorialized Bill Barilko. Barilko scored the series winning goal for the 1951 Stanley Cup Finals before disappearing months later. On October 17, 2017, several days after the death of The Tragically Hip's lead singer Gord Downie, the Maple Leafs held a moment of silence prior to their game, as well as lower the banner of Barilko's retired number.
Other songs which reference the team includes "Out for a Rip" by hip-hop artist B.Rich, who stated his desire to see the club win the Stanley Cup, stating that "if the Leafs win the Cup," he would jump in a lake. In a rare French-language example, Québecois singer Bob Bissonnette praises the club, and the tradition of Hockey Night in Canada in his song 'Maple Leafs.' Canadian musician Joni Mitchell also mentions the Leafs in the song “Raised on Robbery” which is featured on her 1974 album "Court and Spark".
Visual art.
College station of the Toronto subway system feature a pair of murals called "Hockey Knights in Canada", named after "Hockey Night in Canada"; one depicting the Toronto Maple Leafs on the southbound side and facing the Montreal Canadiens on the northbound side, depicting the rivalry between the two clubs. They were created by Charles Pachter in 1984, when the Toronto Maple Leafs still played at nearby Maple Leaf Gardens.

Derek Arthur Jelley (born 4 March 1972) is a former professional rugby union player who appeared 145 times for Leicester Tigers between 1993–2003, 23 times for Wakefield and once for Rotherham Titans. Jelley played both loosehead and tighthead prop.
Career.
Leicester.
Jelley joined Leicester in 1992 at 21. His debut came on 4 April 1993 away to Rugby on the final day of the 1992-93 Courage League season. Jelley was regular understudy for Graham Rowntree with one of the two starting every game at loosehead prop between 2 September 1993 – 6 November 1996 until the emergence of Perry Freshwater forced Jelley onto the tighthead side of scrum. A shoulder injury kept Jelley out of action for four months and limited him to only three starts in Tigers 1997–98, however the following campaign was his best with a club-leading 35 appearances in the 1998–99 season, including 20 starts, as Leicester won the Premiership that season. Jelley's appearances became more limited as Freshwater was preferred as reserve loosehead and Ricky Nebbett was signed to cover tighthead. His final Leicester appearance was in 23 January 2003 at Welford Road in the Heineken Cup against Neath.
Wakefield and Rotherham.
Jelley joined Wakefield on loan for the 2002–03 National Division One season. After making his debut on 31 August 2002 against Exeter Chiefs he made 23 appearances for the Yorkshire club that season. He joined Rotherham in the summer of 2003 following their promotion to the Premiership but suffered a career ending shoulder injury in his only game for the club.

Capt. Thomas Fanning Farmstead

The Capt. Thomas Fanning Farmstead is a historic farm property at 1004 Shewville Road in Ledyard, Connecticut. With a building history dating to about 1746, it is one of the oldest surviving agricultural properties in the town, including the house, barn, and smaller outbuildings. The property, now reduced to , was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.
Description and history.
The Captain Thomas Fanning Farmstead is located in a rural setting in northern Ledyard, near the town line with Preston. It is set on four acres on the east side of Shewville Road, one of which houses the buildings of the farmstead around a grassy meadow. The house is a 1-1/2 story Cape style wood frame structure, with a central chimney. It is oriented with its main facade angled away from the road, toward the southeast. That facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance. A shed-roof section extends the building to the rear (toward the street). Outbuildings spread around the meadow include an 18th-century barn, and several 19th-century farm buildings: a corn crib, blacksmith shop, sheds, and another small barn. Some of the outbuildings stand on older foundations than what their construction methods suggest.
The documented history of the property begins in 1746-47, when Thomas Fanning purchased from Jonathan Brewster of Preston, with a barn standing on it. A portion of the house (roughly the western three bays) was built by Fanning not long afterward, and was probably widened to five bays by Fanning's son Frederick, who took over the property in 1789. He sold the property to his brother-in-law in 1793.

Marcelin Albert

Marcelin Albert (29 March 1851 – 21 December 1921) was a French cafe owner and winegrower considered the leader of the 1907 revolt of the Languedoc winegrowers.
Early years.
Marcelin Albert was born on 29 March 1851 in Argeliers, Aude.
The village is a few miles north of Narbonne.
He seems to have been a simple man but a powerful orator.
Albert owned a café and was a small-scale winegrower. 
Albert was a moderate republican, as were his fellow villagers, none of whom joined the strikes of 1904.
One historian described Albert as follows: "A small peasant from Argeliers, who looked like a Spanish Christ, Marcelin Albert was a jack of all trades: director of a theatrical troupe, a café owner and a winemaker. In his village he was called "lo Cigal" (the Cicada), because of his whimsical and carefree spirit.
In 1900 Albert began fighting for the defense of natural wine against fake wine."
In 1902, 1903 and 1905 Albert travelled around the villages of region talking to small groups of vinegrowers and workers and trying, without much success, to convince them to set aside their differences and form committees to demand help from the government.
Albert avoided politics, but spoke out for the rights of honourable, hard-working people who had been exploited by defrauders, merchants and the government.
During a slump in wine prices, in 1905 a demonstration of 15,000 people was staged in Béziers.
Albert then launched his "petition of 1905", which collected four hundred signatures.
It read, "The undersigned have decided to pursue their just claims to the end, to go on strike against the tax, to demand the resignation of all the elected bodies and commit all the communes of the south and Algeria to follow their example with shouts of 'Long live natural wine! Down with the poisoners!.
On 18 February 1907 Albert sent a telegram to Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau in which he spelled out the suffering in the Midi due to the slump.
Winegrower's revolt.
On 11 March 1907 the signal for the revolt was given by a group of Minervois vine growers in Argeliers. 
They were led by Albert and Elie Bernard, who founded the Comité de defense viticole (Committee of Viticulture Defense), known as the Comité d'Argeliers (Argeliers Committee). 
The Committee was composed of President Marcelin Albert, Vice-President Édouard Bourges and Secretaries Cathala, Richard and Bernard.
They organized a march to Narbonne of 87 vine growers for an interview with a parliamentary commission. 
The parliamentary committee to review the situation arrived in Narbonne on 11 March and received a delegation led by Albert.
The outcome was not satisfactory.
After their testimony the winegrowers' committee made a tour of the city, for the first time singing "La Vigneronne", which from that day became the anthem of the revolt of the paupers.
Albert considered the one and only worthwhile fight was for natural wines. 
He refused to engage in the debate on the divergent interests of the workers and the owners, did not question the presence of royalists who openly wanted to claim the movement, and did not appreciate that on the pretext that the Occitan language is the mother tongue of the Midi wine growers, the regionalists want to make the fight into a separatist movement.
On 24 March the first meeting organized by the Committee of Argeliers was held in front of 300 people in Sallèles-d'Aude. 
Marcelin Albert stood out for his gifts as an orator and his charisma.
During the revolt he was often called "the messiah" or "the redeemer". 
It was agreed to hold a meeting every Sunday in a different city.
On 21 April the first issue of "Le Tocsin" was published by the Argeliers Committee.
It was a weekly directed by Marcelin Albert and written by Louis Blanc. 
The first issue contained a request to parliament to pass a law against wine fraud.
Albert remained vague about what he wanted done.
In his view it was up to the government to solve the crisis.
On 12 May 1907 these were 150,000 demonstrators at the Béziers rally.
Jean Jaurès spoke and then Albert launched an ultimatum to the government asking it to raise the price of wine.
Ernest Ferroul set this ultimatum to expire on 10 June and advocated a tax strike if the government had not acted by then.
On 26 May from 220,000 to 250,000 people demonstrated in Carcassonne.
Marcelin Albert said, "The Albigenses were once gathered under these walls, they fell there in defense of their freedom. 
We will do like them! Forward for the defense of our rights! The Midi wants it, the Midi will have it!"
On 9 June 1907 there was a gigantic gathering in Montpellier. 
The Place de la Comédie was invaded by a crowd estimated to number from 600,000 to 800,000 people.
Marcelin Albert delivered such a speech that the journalist for "Le Figaro" wrote, "It was mad, sublime, terrifying".
On 19 June Ernest Ferroul was arrested at dawn at his home in Narbonne by troops of the 139th Infantry Regiment and imprisoned in Montpellier. 
News of the planned arrest of all members of the Committee of Argeliers caused an explosion.
Marcelin Albert, who had not been arrested, was hidden in the belfry of Argeliers.
Chased by the police, Marcelin Albert fled to Paris where he arrived on 22 June 1907. 
The National Assembly, in full debate over the bill against fraud, refused to receive him. 
Georges Clemenceau heard of his presence and agreed to grant him a hearing. 
The premier received him in his role of Minister of the Interior at Place Beauvau. 
During their interview he promised to repress fraud if, in return, Albert returned to Languedoc to calm the rebellion, and even agreed to be a prisoner. 
Clemenceau signed a safe-conduct for his return to the Aude and gave him one hundred francs to pay for his return by train. 
Albert was naive enough to accept it.
Clemenceau took the opportunity to give his version to the political journalists and stressed the history of the payment. 
The national dailies took this up and Albert's status changed from redeemer to sell-out.
On 24 June Albert was back in Narbonne. 
He met the members of the new defense committee and tried to convince them to suspend the movement. 
However, the interview with Clemenceau had totally discredited him in their eyes.
On 26 June Albert went to Montpellier to become a prisoner.
Last years.
Albert spent over a month in prison for his own safety, and was almost lynched when he was released.
He spent the rest of his life in obscurity.
No longer wanted in the Aude, Albert moved to Algeria. 
There the winemakers clubbed together to support someone who had defended their profession, but Albert died in poverty.
Albert died in his home village of Argelliers on 12 December 1921.
In 1948 Louis Blanc published a pamphlet on the 1907 revolt.
He wrote of Albert,
Today many plaques commemorate Albert and many public squares and municipal buildings are named after him.

<doc id="56731968" url="?curid=56731968" title="Nakrang Kingdom">
Nakrang Kingdom

Nakrang Kingdom () was the kingdom located in the northwestern part of the Korean Peninsula according to Samguk Sagi. The kingdom's sovereignty, however, is debated. 
According to the ancient Korean record of Samguk Sagi, the king of Nakrang named Choi Ri () met the Prince Hodong of Goguryeo and let him marry his daughter, the Princess of Nakrang. When Prince Hodong asked the princess to break drums and horns in the Nakrang's armory to prevent the kingdom's guards from alerting the attack by Goguryeo, the princess followed Hodong's instructions, leading Nakrang to be conquered by Goguryeo. 
Dispute regarding sovereignty.
The view regarding Nakrang's sovereignty is disputed. While Chinese and Japanese scholars claim that the name Nakrang actually meant Lelang Commandery of China's Han dynasty and Choi Ri was Lelang's governor rather than a king, Korean scholars often view Nakrang as an independent kingdom.  
Korean perspective.
Korean scholars tend to view Nakrang to be an independent kingdom given that the ancient Korean record Samguk Sagi referred Nakrang as a kingdom and Choi Ri as Nakrang's king (樂浪王). They also point out the lack of Chinese record mentioning Choi Ri as the official of Lelang. It is also noted that Goguryeo must had attacked Lelang Commandry during the time period mentioned in Samguk Sagi if the name Nakrang indeed referred to Lelang. However, there is no record of such war between Goguryeo and Lelang at the mentioned time, suggesting that Nakrang was possibly a different state than Lelang.
Because the record of Samguk Sagi also suggested that Choi Ri and Hodong met near modern-day Hamhung, some South Korean scholars speculate Nakrang to be a kingdom centered around Hamhung, possibly related to the several states that briefly evolved and lived after the abolishment of Lelang Commandery before being absorbed by Goguryeo.
North Korean academia fully assert that Nakrang was an independent country that existed in modern-day Pyongyang and composed Mahan confederacy, arguing Lelang Commandery to be actually located near Liao River of Liaodong Peninsula. The North Korean academia also speculate the Chinese-style ruins and relics found in Pyongyang to be either the war bounties, introduced through the trade, or even forged. They also emphasize that the Korean characteristics found in the ruins and relics should not be negated. 
Chinese and Japanese perspective.
The Chinese and Japanese scholars state that the Nakrang Kingdom was just another name used to refer to the Lelang Commandery. This perspective claims that it was referred to with the name of a kingdom because the residents were autonomous but still were controlled by the commandery. The king of the Nakrang kingdom was also interpreted to be the same title as the governor of the commanery.
Kenji Takahisa (Professor of Korean History at Senshu University) mentions “In that theory, there were Nakrang Kingdom which founded by old Korean ethnic group in Pyongyang, not Lelang Commandery of Han. However, it is difficult to prove this theory because there are many tombs influenced by Han culture found in Pyongyang, while there were not related archaeological and historical resources related to Lelang Commandery in Liaoning area.”
, criticized that the claim that Nakrang Kingdom is not same as Lelang Commandery and said that it ignored the situation of Lelang Commandery in the Eastern Han dynasty.る

Reunion (Gotham)

"Reunion" is the fourteenth episode of the fourth season and 80th episode overall from the Fox series "Gotham". The show is itself based on the characters created by DC Comics set in the Batman mythology. The episode was written by Peter Blake and directed by co-executive producer Annabelle K. Frost. It was first broadcast on March 15, 2018.
In the episode, Ivy decides to go against everyone who harmed her, targeting the Wayne Enterprises foundation charity event. Meanwhile, Nygma continues suffering a mental breakdown regarding his split personality, causing him to consider suicide. Bruce also continues pursuing Alfred to return to his old position to little to no success while Lee meets with Sofia to talk about business.
Plot.
Bruce (David Mazouz) burns down his vigilante's mask. He then goes to meet Alfred (Sean Pertwee), who refuses to return until he shows him "he's changed." Meanwhile, Ivy (Peyton List) arrives at a bar where she uses her plants to hypnotize the bystanders.
Lee (Morena Baccarin) meets with Sofia (Crystal Reed), who wants a sizable part of the Narrows' control. Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and the GCPD investigate the bar incident and discover that Ivy is responsible, intending to kill Bullock (Donal Logue) for her father's death. At Bullock's apartment, the GCPD watches as Ivy makes a broadcasting message throughout the TV to show her powers. Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) is still getting teased by his personality, to the point he's even considering suicide as a solution to avoid it.
Gordon and Bullock find Ivy on a warehouse but she uses her powers to escape and hold Bullock at her control. After battling Bullock with a gun, Gordon knocks him down, breaking Ivy's control. Bruce attends a charity foundation and runs into Alfred, who states that he needs to accept "who he really is." Then, Ivy interrupts the event and uses her plant to kill many people at the event when the GCPD arrives. Bruce dons a suit and rescues many people before being shot by Gordon on his bulletproof vest. However, he manages to escape. Afterwards Bruce finally makes up with Alfred, who returns to the mansion.
Sofia meets again with Lee, who refuses her offer for control of the Narrows. However, Sofia kills her bodyguard and smashes Lee's hand with a hammer, stating she now has control of the Narrows, putting Sampson (Stu "Large" Riley) as the new head. Nygma opts to return to Arkham instead. However, Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) reappears and he reveals to him that he had specifically written the letter so that his dual personality would read it and take Nygma back to Arkham. With Bullock back on the precinct, Gordon vows to take Sofia down.

William Randolph III (son of Thomas)

William Randolph III (1712 or 1713–1745) was the son of Thomas Randolph of Tuckahoe in Goochland County, Virginia. He built the elegant two-story residence for Tuckahoe. Randolph held the positions of Clerk and Justice in Goochland County and he represented the county as a member of the House of Burgesses. He was the first Clerk of Albemarle County.
He was a good friend of Peter Jefferson, whose wife Jane Randolph Jefferson was Randolph's first cousin. The Jefferson's raised Randolph's children after his wife's death in 1742 and his death in 1745.
Early life.
William was born in 1712 or 1713. Named after his grandfather William Randolph of Turkey Island, he was the son of Thomas Randolph and Judith Fleming Randolph, who was the daughter of Susanna Tarleton and Charles Fleming of New Kent County. William had two sisters, Maria Judith and Mary Isham.
Thomas founded Tuckahoe after he purchased land on September 4, 1714 from his brother John. The first church in the area Dover Church was built by his father in 1720 in exchange for 54,990 pounds of tobacco. Until 1728, the area was mostly wilderness with just a few homesteads. Thomas died in 1730. Judith married Nicolas Davies, an immigrant from Wales, on December 24, 1733.
Career.
Plantation manager and owner.
William Byrd of Westover visited Judith and questioned the difficulties the eighteen-year-old might face for taking on a lot of responsibility before getting a good education. In any event, Randolph became an able manager of the family's plantation and fit in well with the "elite planter culture". Household and farm work was performed by indentured servants and enslaved men, women, and children. The slave quarters at Tuckahoe were larger than most slave quarters, which could be as small as 12 by 8 feet. They were about 16 by 20 feet, but were divided into two units, which were separated by a central chimney. Each room had an exterior door.
Tuckahoe, located along the James River in Goochland County, Virginia, was near the properties of his uncle, Isham Randolph of Dungeness, and Peter and Jane Jefferson. He patented 2400 acres in what is now Albemarle County. The land was adjacent to a 2000-acre tract owned by Peter Jefferson. Randolph sold 200 acres that was adjacent to Peter Jefferson's Shadwell property in 1741 to Jefferson, who used if for the site of his home with his wife Jane.
Politics.
He worked for Goochland County as the Clerk and a Justice. In 1744, he became the first Clerk of Albemarle County, newly formed from part of Goochland County. He was elected to the House of Burgesses representing Goochland County in 1742, but died before the February 20, 1746 session.
Marriage and children.
In 1733, Randolph started building a two-story house on Tuckahoe.
In 1735, he married Maria Judith Page, the daughter of Hon. Mann Page and Judith Wormsley or Wormeley of Rosewell. Known as Mary, she had a dowry of £2000 sterling, which the couple used to finish building the mansion mansion for Tuckahoe. It was completed in 1840 and "The Washington Post" said that it is "one of the James River's most famous plantations.
They had four children, including their only son Thomas Mann Randolph Sr.
Death.
Randolph was widowed when Maria died by 1742. He wrote out a will in late 1745, knowing that his three children would become orphans on his death.
William Randolph died in 1745. Although Peter Jefferson had intended to establish a plantation off the Rivanna River, he instead moved his family to Tuckahoe in 1746 and raised William and Maria Judith's children there until 1752, when Thomas Randolph was 21 years of age. During that time Jefferson managed the plantation, was executor of William Randolph’s estate, and was guardian of the children. It was considered unusual that he did not chose a Randolph family member to be guardian of his children or executor of his estate.

Bjelaj Fortress

Bjelaj Fortress locally known as "Stari Grad Bjelaj" (Bjelaj old town), is a medieval town-fortress complex near the village of Bjelaj, Bosanski Petrovac, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Location.
Located on the edge of the Petrovac plain (or part thereof Bjelajsko fields), on the northern slope of the Osječenica mountain. The area around the city is uninhabited and lean. The whole complex is situated on a plateau about long.
History.
On the south end of the northern half, there is a great fort, a prehistoric site from the Bronze and Iron Age. On the north end, there is a small fort. The fort itself has two parts: a medieval southern and northern Ottoman part. The medieval town has a ground plan of an irregular rectangle over 40 meters long and a width of about 35 meters. From the tower on the west side is the beginning of the remains of a large pen that was added along with the medieval city in the Ottoman period.
First mentioned in written sources in 1495 and named after the whiteness (or tint) by which it stood out above Bjelajsko field. Ownership is attributed to Vladislaus II’s Treasurer, who in 1495 is recorded paying to Gašpar Perušić the sum of 30 forints "to preserve his city of Belaj" ("egregio Caspar Perusyth pro conservatione castri sui Belay dati sunt 30 fl."). This clearly shows the settlement was defended by this point. Ten years later, in 1505 had most of the city together with the Sokolac fortress and Ripač by Princess Beatrice Frankopan, limbs Duke Johannes Corvinus, and is in her name all three cities managed kaštelan Dujam Orlovčić.
Between 1530 and 1537, Bjelaj (Bilaj) came under Ottoman rule, becoming part of the Sanjak of Bosnia, the villagers and the cadillac Neretva. Already in 1540, it is mentioned for the first time on Bjelaj nahija, and later it is mentioned as Nahija Bjelaj-Blagaj, but soon falls under the cadiluk Kamengrad, which is mentioned as a cadil in the Bosnian or Klis sandbag. From 1562, Nađija Bjelaj was connected to the cadillac Novosel, who was in the cliché sandžak. It was noted that in 1577 a crew of 370 Ottoman mercenaries was placed in the fortress under the dizdar command. From 1592, the city was part of the Bihac captaincy, and from the 18th century to the composition of the Petrovac captaincy. Dizdar Bjelaj (Bilaja) Alijaga was in the demining commission with the Republic of Venice. In 1747 in Bjelaj there was a crew of 30 members and Dizdar Hasanag. According to the list of fortifications and weapons in them from 1833, in Bjelaj (Bilaj) there was 1 top of 12 pedals and 3 small canopies of 6 pedals.
Description.
Old town Bjelaj (Bilaj) has two parts: the southern medieval and northern Ottoman part. The medieval city has a layout of irregular rectangles over 40 m long (north-south) and about 35 m wide (east-west). The entrance to the city is in the northward.
Medieval part.
It is half-closed, with partially preserved arches and doorways. In the northwest corner, there is a massive round tower 2/3 off the ramparts, about 16 m high. The entrance to the tower is at a height of about 4 m above the current level of the land. According to the outer form, it is assumed that the inside of the tower was divided into three levels: the ground floor or basement, the level at the entrance level, and the space above the entrance because the ceiling can be seen on the canvas wall continuously. East of the entrance are the remains of a narrow, hollow, heavily-walled area as high as the ramparts (15-16m). That space was built up beside the rampart. Only the upper part of it was preserved and probably served for the rise of soldiers to the top of the wall on which they were coarse, and sometimes small loopholes. On the ground are the remains of the eastern part of the longitudinal wall that forms a whole with the vertical rest of the described wall beside the wall. These remains of a wall on the ground share the easternmost part of the interior of the city from the west. After a few meters they are lost to the south, and on the west side towards the tower, they do not see traces. The impression is that it was part of some enclosure that protected the penetration into the city. The western side of the city was harder defensive because the enemy could draw from the back. The western ramparts are therefore monolithic and end up with clods, of which only a very small part has been preserved. Beneath the level of the chestnut tree, there are a number of stone consoles on the top of the ramparts that served as a wooden backbone. Below them is a series of shorter brackets embedded in a rampart. The eastern rampart was facing Bjelaysko polje. On it are 4 large loopholes semi-rounded. and on the west side towards the tower, they do not see traces.

They are designed to shoot from a wooden or stone platform in a standing position. On some of them, the vertical and horizontal, nicely carved stone blocks and slabs that were used as frames are still on the inside of the ramparts. Above the loophole is a horizontal array of holes for the ceiling beams above which there are stone consoles. From the ramparts, there is a view of the entire Bjelas field and the surrounding area. The southern slum is completely demolished. Towards the tower next to the western ramparts is the remains of the tank. The fortresses and towers of an older fortress were built of travertine blocks and broken stone. In front of the northern rampart and entrance to the old part of the city, there is a ditch that is saturated, but its contours can be identified.
Ottoman part.
From the tower on the west side are the remains of a large patch which was built alongside the medieval city in the Ottoman era. The precinct is located north of the older part of the city, almost regular in a four-legged shape, 110 m long, about 40 m wide. Only parts of the western ramparts are preserved, up to a height of 2 m. According to the material, they are completely different from the walls of the medieval city. They were built from a finely broken stone blended with plenty of plaster. There was a small mosque in the backyard. Today, at its place, the hollow is filled with a bunch of stones. The entrance to the pavement was on the north wall. He was overwhelmed by a "shaggy bow". In this place, the overhead remains of the ramparts are barely visible or only its traces. The most well-preserved part of the Ottoman times is south and north of the medieval trench, along with the west side of the plateau. At the end of one section of the western ramparts, another entry appeared to be in that wall north of the ditch. Along the eastern side of the fortress is not preserved.
Current state.
On-site inspection in February 2007, found that the medieval city was still quite well preserved, while only parts of the western wall remained from the Ottoman peninsula. In the walls of the medieval city, the holes from which the stone was taken were seen. It is exposed to deterioration due to neglect, lack of maintenance and absence of an appropriate management plan.
Today Old town Bjelaj is located in the contact zone with the National Park "Una", and in 2007 it was declared a national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

1876 United States presidential election in Colorado

The 1876 United States presidential election in Colorado took place on November 7, 1876, as part of the 1876 United States presidential election. The state legislature chose three representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president, which would be the first and only time the state would do so.
Colorado voted in its first ever presidential election, having become the 38th state on August 1 of that year. The state cast three electoral votes for the Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes. These electors were chosen by the Colorado General Assembly, the state legislature, rather than by popular vote, the last time in American history that a state's electors were chosen without a popular vote. This proved to be decisive as Hayes would win the electoral vote by a margin of one vote. Had Colorado not been a state in time for the 1876 election, Hayes would have lost the 1876 election to Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden.

Galgeninsel

The Galgeninsel is a peninsula on the shore of Lake Constance near Lindau in the Bay of Reutin in Germany.
Geography.
The Galgeninsel peninsula lies 550 metres east of the island of Hoy and about 200 metres south of the loading sidings of Reutin's goods yard, and covers an area of around 1,600 square metres. The territory of the peninsula belongs to the borough of Lindau and "Gemarkung" of Reutin.
History.
The Galgeninsel was originally the island on which the gallows of the Free Imperial City of Lindau stood. Even today, a hole can be seen in a mighty stone block which once held the heavy gallows post. A 16th-century map still shows the Galgeninsel as an island, but not in the correct geographical location. A view of the town dating to the early 18th century gives no indication of whether it was an island or peninsula at that time, because it only appears at the edge of the picture. An 1836 map still clearly shows the Galgeninsel as an island or several islands. Later maps show the Galgeninsel as a peninsula. By 1856, the remains of a prehistoric settlement were observed in the lake near the Galgeninsel. More recent investigations, as part of the planned expansion of the goods year in 2005, did not yield archaeological finds however. The Galgeninsel and the surrounding Bay of Reutin ("Reutiner Bucht") have been designated as a nature reserve.
There is a story of a macabre test which a criminal who was under the death sentence had to undergo. His arms were tied tightly across his back, he was released on Galgeninsel and marched towards Inselstadt, which was a few hundred metres away. The criminal succeeded in making his way through the water, which is deep even at low tide, and reached the mainland. He thus regained his life and freedom.
The last person to be sentenced as a result of the witch trials in Lindau was Maria Madlener. She was executed by sword on 4 August 1730 on the Galgeninsel.
In 2017 the Galgeninsel was the setting of the German TV film, "Die Toten vom Bodensee – Der Wiederkehrer".

Louise Brachmann

Louise Brachmann (2 February 1777 — 17 September 1822) was a German poet, short story writer, and novelist.
Biography.
Louise Brachmann was born in Rochlitz, Saxony, to a civil service father and a cultured mother. Responsible for her education, Louise's mother was close to the Hardenberg family, which included the celebrated poet Novalis. Louise's mother introduced her to Novalis, who, recognizing Brachmann's talent and potential, recommended her to Friedrich von Schiller. Brachmann contributed to Schiller's journals the "Die Horen" and "Musenalmanach". In 1800, four years after her first suicide attempt, her parents, sister, and three close friends died. She met Sophie Mereau in Jena, where she published poems and short stories in modern journals. However, she failed to find a publisher to sponsor her work in her lifetime. Brachmann's second suicide attempt was thwarted and, a few days later, she drowned herself in the river Saale in Halle, Germany.

George B. Davis

George Breckenridge Davis (February 13, 1847 – December 16, 1914) was the tenth Judge Advocate General of the United States Army.
Davis was born at Ware, Massachusetts. In 1863, at the age of 16 years, he enlisted in the 1st Massachusetts Volunteer Cavalry. As a cavalryman and later a second lieutenant of volunteers, he served in 25 battles and engagements during the American Civil War.
Appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point two years after the War, Davis graduated in 1871 and was commissioned a second lieutenant of the 5th U.S. Cavalry. Immediately after his marriage to Ella Prince of West Springfield, Massachusetts, in July 1871, Lieutenant Davis spent two years on the Wyoming and Arizona frontiers with the 5th Cavalry. His next tour was at West Point, where he served for five years as Assistant Professor of Spanish, teaching French, geology, chemistry and mineralogy as well. Promotion to 1st Lieutenant in 1878 brought with it another five-year tour on the Western frontier.
The return to West Point in 1883 gave Davis a chance to head the History Department as principal assistant professor, and to serve as assistant professor of law, instructing also in geography and ethics. During this tour he completed his "Outline of International Law". Simultaneously with his promotion, Captain Davis was rotated to the Western Territory in August 1888.
Only four months later, however, Davis's professional abilities were recognized and required in Washington. He was appointed a Major, Judge Advocate General's Department, and transferred to the Office of the Secretary of War. Davis took advantage of the Washington tour to obtain his LL.B. and LL.M. degrees at Columbian (now George Washington University) Law School. He was made Lieutenant Colonel and Deputy Judge Advocate General in 1895, but left Washington the next year to serve as Professor of Law at West Point.
It was during the next few years that Davis completed his major publications. His "Elements of Law and Elements of International Law" (1897) were followed by his definitive "Treatise on the Military Law of the United States" in 1898. In addition, Davis authored several historical and professional works on the tactical use of cavalry. "The War of the Rebellion", a 70-volume compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate Armies, was principally his work and was published in his name in 1880-1901. Davis was promoted to Colonel in 1901, and a few months later became a Brigadier and Judge Advocate General, a post he was to occupy for a decade. (His appointment followed that of Thomas F. Barr of Massachusetts and John W. Clous, a native of Germany, each of whom served as Judge Advocate General for one day in May 1901 in order to retire with the rank of Brigadier General.) General Davis guided his department through the Spanish–American War, and handled the investigation and trial of the notorious cases arising out of that war. He also represented the United States as delegate plenipotentiary to the Geneva Conventions of 1903 and 1906, and the Hague Convention of 1907. On February 14, 1911, General Davis retired with a promotion to major general. He died on December 16, 1914.

Idiothele mira

Idiothele mira, also known as the blue-foot baboon or the trap-door tarantula, is a species of tarantula endemic to South Africa and is popularized by hobbyists for the striking blue coloration on the ventral side of the tarsi and metatarsi on each leg. Furthermore, the species is well known for belonging to one of two described genera of theraphosids that build a trapdoor, the other being "Typhochlaena".
Description.
"Idiothele mira" is a small species, mature females reaching 4.5 inches in diagonal leg span and is very reclusive, rarely leaving its burrow, usually only for mating purposes. This species is easily distinguished by its bright blue "toes" or tarsi and metatarsi, paired with a black and golden carapace, gold radiating within black in a "starburst" pattern, the abdomen is also golden with black speckling. Males have a smaller body size when compared to the leg span, and reach 3.5 inches on average. The eggsac of "Idiothele mira" commonly contains 25-45 spiderlings. The type specimen is a mature female found in the "Ndumo Game Farm" of South Africa, an area that has high summer rainfall followed by extremely dry winters.
Etymology.
From the Latin for "wonderful", referring to the sky-blue coloration on the tarsi and metatarsi.

Peter Ashmun Ames

Peter Ashmun Ames (June 10, 1888 - November 21, 1920) was an American British Army intelligence officer and member of the Cairo Gang who was assassinated by the Irish Republican Army.
Early life.
Peter Ashmun Ames was born on June 10, 1888, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, the son of Elias Hurlbut Ames (1851-1891) and Eleanor Gray Bushnell (1855-1946). Both Ames' father and maternal grandfather, Joseph Bushnell (1831-1918), came from old New England families and became wealthy during the Pennsylvania Oil Rush. Ames' great-grandfather was the Pittsburgh industrialist Daniel Bushnell. After Elias Ames' death in 1891 at age 39, Peter's mother moved the family to Morristown, New Jersey, where her children had a privileged upbringing in the town that was then known as an "inland Newport.". Ames attended the Stevens Institute of Technology, graduating in 1911.
Career.
In 1912, Ames moved to London to take a position with a firm in the city. In 1917, he joined the elite Grenadier Guards of the British Army and fought in France during the First World War. 
In June 1920, at the height of the Irish War of Independence, Ames moved to Dublin, Ireland on assignment from the British military intelligence, serving as an undercover agent for the MI5. Along with the other members of the Cairo Gang spy ring, Ames worked to track the operations of Irish Republican Army militants and maintain British control in Dublin. 
The activities of the Cairo Gang were soon detected by Irish Republican Army leaders, however, who formulated a plot, led by Michael Collins, to eliminate the covert group. On the morning of Sunday, November 21, 1920, IRA gunmen stormed into the house at 38 Upper Mount Street where Ames and another agent were staying. Ames attempted to reach for the .45-caliber Colt pistol he had hidden beneath his pillow, but was held down by the gunmen before he could get to his weapon. After being made to stand facing the wall of his bedroom, Ames was shot six times in the back and killed.
One of the assassins, Vinny Byrne, wrote an account of the murders:"As I opened the folding-doors, the officer, who was in bed, was in the act of going for his gun under his pillow. Doyle and myself dashed into the room, at the same time ordering him to put up his hands, which he did. Doyle dashed around by the side of the bed, and pulled a Colt .45 from beneath the pillow. Right behind us came Frank Saurin and he started collecting from papers etc., which was his job. I remember looking into a drawer and seeing a Sinn Fein tie there and, if I am not mistaken, photographs of the 1916 leaders. I ordered the British officer to get out of bed. He asked me what was going to happen and I replied : 'Ah, nothing.' I then ordered him to march in front of me ... I marched my officer down to the back room where the other officer was. He was standing up in the bed, facing the wall. I ordered mine to do likewise. When the two of them were together I thought to myself 'The Lord have mercy on your souls ! ' I then opened fire with my Peter. They both fell dead."The report delivered to the House of Lords on the murders of Bloody Sunday described the events at 38 Upper Mount as well:"This house was entered at 9.10 a.m. by twenty armed, unmasked men who were let in by a servant, Catherine Farrell, who unwillingly and under constraint pointed out the rooms occupied by Lieutenant Aimes, of the Grenadier Guards, and Lieutenant Bennett, of the R.A.S.C., Motor Transport. The maid rushed upstairs and warned an officer who was sleeping on the upper floor, and another male lodger, that murder was being done downstairs. A fusilade of shots was heard. When they came down-stairs they found two bodies in a pool of blood in Aimes's bedroom. Bennett had evidently been dragged from the bedroom in his bedclothes into his brother officer's room where both were shot together, their bodies lying side by side."
Personal life.
Peter Ashmun Ames was engaged to marry Millicent Orr-Ewing, a niece of the Duke of Roxburghe and a close friend of Barbara Cartland, at the time of his death. Their engagement was announced in "The New York Times" the same day that Ames was assassinated. Ames' brother, Joseph Bushnell Ames, was a prolific novelist, and his aunt, Alice Alden Bushnell, married a son of the lawyer George Goelet Kip. The philanthropist Mary Warden Harkness, wife of Charles W. Harkness, was the first cousin of Ames' mother Eleanor.

Lauren Hogg (born June 10, 2003) is an American author and activist against gun violence. She survived the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018 and after became a co-founder of March for Our Lives and advocates against gun violence. She is the younger sister of activist David Hogg.
Early life and Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.
Hogg was born on June 10, 2003, and is the daughter of Kevin Hogg, a former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Rebecca Boldrick, born in San Diego County, California and a teacher for Broward County Public Schools in Broward County, Florida. She is also the younger sister of David Hogg, both graduating from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018 and 2021, respectively. Hogg and her family moved to Washington, D.C. after her graduation in 2021.
In 2018, Hogg was a freshman at Stoneman Douglas High School when a gunman came onto campus and started shooting. Hogg was in a television production class when the shooting started; the fire alarm was activated and she believed it was possibly a prank because they had had a fire alarm drill earlier in the day. However, once in the stairwell after evacuating due to the alarm, she realized that it was not a prank after she saw students running out of the building. She went back to her classroom and unlocked a closet in the room and hid with other students. Hogg reunited with her brother and father later that day. She lost four friends in the shooting.
Gun control advocacy.
After the shooting, Hogg became an activist against gun violence in the United States and became a co-founder of the March for Our Lives protests. She co-authored a book with her brother, David Hogg, called "#NeverAgain: A New Generation Draws the Line" published by Random House.
Hogg testified as a witness before the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Recovery in September 2019, following new legislation in the United States Senate that addressed school safety. Before the hearing, she spoke at a rally against gun violence alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Speaking to members of the subcommittee, Hogg said, "I think if we did enough, I wouldn't be here. I wouldn't have lost my friends." She also told members that lawmakers need to take steps including hiring mental health professionals to provide grief counseling to students and provide security that does not militarize schools, in opposition to Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis signing a bill into law public school districts to arm teachers.
In 2019 Hogg wrote "Activist", a graphic novel.
Political views.
Hogg describes herself as liberal and supports raising the purchase age of firearms from 18 to 21, because the shooter of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting was 19 years old and purchased the gun legally.

The 2017 Ayorou attack occurred on 21 October 2017 when armed militants attacked a Nigerien military outpost in the village of Ayorou in southwestern Niger, killing 13 gendarmes. Occurring just weeks after a similar attack in the area killed four American and four Nigerien troops, the attack was carried out by gunmen who crossed the porous border from Mali. At dawn, militants in 4-5 vehicles and motorcycles and armed with machine guns and rocket launchers attacked paramilitary policemen in Ayorou, a small town on the banks of the Niger River 200 kilometers (125 mi) northwest of Niamey. Thirteen gendarmes were killed and five others were wounded. At least one of the attackers was killed as well. The attackers fled after police reinforcements arrived and pursued them to the border. A similar raid was carried out on the same outpost the previous May.
In a statement released by the U.S. embassy, the United States strongly condemned the attack and offered condolences to the families of the victims.

Columbus O'Donnell Iselin (September 26, 1851 – November 11, 1933) was an American financier and philanthropists who was prominent in New York Society during the Gilded Age.
Early life.
Iselin was born in New York City on September 26, 1851. He was fourth of seven children born to Adrian Georg Iselin (1818–1905) and Eleanora (née O'Donnell) Iselin (1821–1897). His siblings were Adrian Iselin Jr., who married Louise Caylus, and Sarah Gracie King Bronson, the widow of Frederic Bronson; William Emil Iselin, who married Alice Rogers Jones; Eleanora Iselin, who married DeLancey Astor Kane, brother of Woodbury Kane and great-grandson of John Jacob Astor; Charles Oliver Iselin, who married Fannie Garner, and later, Edith Hope Goddard; Georgine Iselin, a Papal Countess who did not marry; and Emilie Eleanora Iselin, who married John George Beresford, a cousin of Lord Charles Beresford and grandson of Henry Beresford, 2nd Marquess of Waterford. in 1898.

In Switzerland, the Iselin family had been merchants, public officials, and military and professional men since the 14th century. His maternal grandparents were General Columbus O'Donnell, who was connected with the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, and his wife Eleanora (née Pascault) O'Donnell of Baltimore, Maryland. His mother was related to John Carroll, the first Roman Catholic bishop in the United States and the founder of Georgetown University.

Iselin's father, a former dry goods merchant, founded the investment bank of A. Iselin and Co., located at 36 Wall Street, in 1854. Columbus continued his father's work at the firm following their father's retirement in 1878. After his father's death in 1905, he and his elder brother Adrian Iselin Jr. took control of the firm. His nephew, Ernest Iselin, was director of the company from 1929 to 1934 and chairman of the board from 1936 to 1954. The firm was in existence until 1936 when it was merged with Dominick &amp; Dominick, an investment and merchant banking firm that exists to this day.

Kantō Massacre

The Kantō Massacre was a mass murder which the Japanese military, police and vigilantes committed against the Korean residents of the Kantō region, as well as socialists, communists, anarchists, and other dissidents, in the immediate aftermath of the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. The massacre of Korean residents in particular is also known as the Massacre of Koreans in 1923.
The massacre occurred over a period of three weeks starting on September 1, 1923, the day on which a massive earthquake struck the Kantō region. During this period, soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army, police and vigilantes murdered an estimated 6,000 ethnic Koreans and Japanese socialists. The massacre was denied by Japanese authorities almost immediately after it occurred, while it was celebrated by certain elements in the public. It continues to be alternately denied and celebrated by Japanese right-wing groups today.
Timeline.
September 1: Korean labor union offers food relief.
Korean laborers in Yokohama had joined a stevedore union led by the Japanese organizer Yamaguchi Seiken. Yamaguchi was a left-wing organizer and at the May Day rally in 1920 some of his union members had shouted anti-colonial slogans, incurring arrests and abuse from Japanese police. On September 1, 1923, immediately after the earthquake, Yamaguchi organized his union to provide food and water to the neighborhood, including commandeering supplies from ruined buildings. Police regarded the labor union as a "nest of socialists" and were likely unsettled by the well-organized food relief program.
September 1–2: Police spread false rumors and give permission to kill.
Kanagawa Prefectural Police chief Nishizaka Katsuto reported that on the night of September 1 he gave his district chiefs "a certain mission to deal with the emergency situation," the details of which he refused to describe. Towards the end of his life, Nishizaka told an interviewer that "someone must have said that 'Korean malcontents' were dangerous in such a time of confusion."
According to multiple reports from Japanese witnesses, beginning on the night of September 2 police officers in Yokohama, Kanagawa and Tokyo began informing residents that it was permissible to kill Koreans. Some orders were conditional, such as killing Koreans who resist arrest, but others were more direct: "kill any Koreans who enter the neighborhood" or "kill any Koreans you find." Also on the night of September 2, as police organized a vigilante band to kill Koreans in the Noge region of Yokohama, one of the organizing police officers told a newspaper reporter that Koreans had been caught with a list of neighborhoods to burn, carrying gasoline and poison for wells. In the town of Yokosuka, police officers told locals that Korean men were raping Japanese women, inciting Japanese men to form vigilante lynch mobs. In Bunkyō, the police falsely reported that Koreans had poisoned the water and food supply. Nishizaka's final report on the massacre acknowledges in a secret appendix that these rumors were all false.
September 2–9: Japanese lynch mobs massacre Koreans and others.
As a result of the police-initiated rumors, beginning on September 2 Japanese citizens organized themselves into vigilante bands and accosted strangers on the street. Those who were believed to be Korean or Chinese were murdered on the spot. Vigilantes armed themselves with bamboo spears, clubs, Japanese swords, and guns. People who wore Korean or Chinese clothes were immediately killed, along with members of minority groups such as Ryukyuans whose languages were difficult for other Japanese people and foreigners to understand. 
On the morning of September 3, the Home Ministry issued a message to police stations around the capital encouraging the spread of rumors and violence, stating that “there are a group of people who want to take advantage of disasters. Be careful because Koreans are planning terrorism and robbery by arson and bombs." 
Koreans, Chinese, and Ryukyuans wore Japanese clothing in order to hide their identities. They also tried to properly pronounce shibboleths such as "十五円五十銭" (15 yen and 50 sen), with difficult elongated vowels. Those who failed these tests were killed. During that time, not only Koreans but also Chinese, Ryukyuans, and foreigners were all marked as Koreans. Some journalists who came to Tokyo were mistaken for Koreans and killed due to differences in their pronunciations. The vigilantes were indiscriminate with regards to gender and age. When the massacre reached its peak, the rivers Sumidagawa and Arakawa which flowed through Tokyo were stained with blood.
The filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who was a child at the time, was astonished to witness the irrational behavior of the mob.
Some Koreans sought safety in police stations in order to escape the slaughter, but in some areas vigilantes broke into police stations and pulled them out. In other cases, police officers handed groups of Koreans over to local vigilantes, who proceeded to kill them. The arrival of foreigners and other people in Tokyo meant death. The police continued to assist the killings or responded to reports of murder passively. In contrast, the Yakuza, who accepted Koreans among their membership, protected Koreans from the lynch mobs. 
Both vigilantes and Japanese Army troops burned Korean bodies in order to destroy the evidence of murder. Official Japanese reports in September claimed that only five Koreans had been killed, and even years after, the number of acknowledged deaths remained in the low hundreds. After the massacre, Korean survivors painstakingly documented the extent of the massacre. Based on their testimonies, Japanese eyewitness accounts, and additional academic research, current estimates of the death toll range from 6,000 to 9,000. Between 50 to 90 percent of the Korean population of Yokohama was killed.
September 3–16: Police and army assassinate left-wing leaders.
Amidst the mob violence, regional police and the Imperial Army used the pretext of civil unrest to liquidate political dissidents. Socialists such as (平澤計七) and the Chinese communal leader Wang Xitian (王希天), were abducted and killed by local police and Imperial Army, who claimed the radicals intended to use the crisis as an opportunity to overthrow the Japanese government.
In a particularly egregious instance known as the Amakasu Incident, the married couple Sakae Ōsugi (Japan's first Esperanto teacher) and Noe Itō, both anarchists and feminists, were executed by Imperial Army officer Masahiko Amakasu along with their six-year-old nephew. The bodies of the parents and child were thrown in a well. The incident created national outrage and Amakasu was sentenced to ten years in prison, but he served only three.
September 18–November: Show trials and unpaid labor.
Beginning on September 18, the Japanese government arrested 735 participants in the massacre. However, the government had no intent of sentencing the participants as they would murderers. In November, the "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" reported that during the trials, the defendants and the judges were both smiling and laughing as they recounted the lynchings. The prosecution recommended light sentences.
As knowledge of the lynch mobs spread through the Korean community, thousands attempted to flee the city. The Tokyo police tasked a collaborationist group called Sōaikai with arresting escaping Koreans and detaining them in camps in Honjo, Tokyo. Tokyo police chief Maruyama Tsurukichi ordered the Sōaikai to confine Koreans to the camps to prevent them from spreading news of the massacre abroad. The Sōaikai eventually ordered 4,000 Koreans to perform unpaid labor cleaning up the city ruins for over two months.
Aftermath.
On September 5, after the Prime Minister of Japan acknowledged that unlawful killings had occurred, Tokyo officials met secretly to discuss a way to deny and minimize the massacre. Laying out their plans in a memorandum, they agreed to minimize the number of dead, blame the rumors of Korean violence on the labor organizer Yamaguchi Seiken, and frameup innocent Koreans and accuse them of actually rioting. This plan was executed in the following months. A ban on reporting the death count was obeyed by all newspapers, while officials claimed only five people had died. On October 21, almost two months after the massacre began, local police arrested 23 Koreans, simultaneously lifting the ban so that the initial reporting on the full scale of the massacre was mixed with the false arrests.
Yamaguchi was publicly blamed by Japanese officials for starting the rumors of Korean mobs, but this logically incoherent charge was never formalized. After being held in prison for several months he was finally prosecuted only for redistributing food and water from ruined houses to earthquake survivors without permission of the homeowners. In July 1924 he was sentenced to two years in prison; it is unknown if he survived his imprisonment.
Korean newspapers in Seoul were blocked from receiving information about the massacre by local police. Two Koreans who personally escaped Tokyo and rushed to Seoul to report the news were arrested for "spreading false information" and the news report about them was completely censored. When word of the massacre did reach the Korean peninsula, Japan attempted to placate the Koreans by distributing films throughout the country showing Koreans being well treated. These films were reportedly poorly received. The Governor-General of Korea paid out 200 yen in compensation to 832 families of massacre victims, although the Japanese government on the mainland only admitted to about 250 deaths. The Governor-General also published and distributed propaganda leaflets with "beautiful stories" ("bidan" 美談) of Japanese protecting Koreans from lynch mobs. Police chief Nishizaka himself distributed "bidan" stories of heroic police protecting Koreans, which he later admitted in an interview were carefully selected to omit unflattering aspects.
Japanese whitewashing and denialism.
After the massacre, Navy Minister Takarabe Takeshi praised the Japanese lynch mobs for their "martial spirit," describing them as a successful result of military conscription. Paper plays called kamishibai were performed for children which portrayed the slaughter with vivid, bloody illustrations. Performers would encourage children to cheer for the lynch mobs as they killed "dangerous" Koreans. In 1927, an official history of Yokohama City claimed that the rumors of Korean attackers had "some basis in fact." In 1996, historian J. Michael Allen remarked that the massacre is "hardly known outside Korea."
Books denying the massacre and repeating the government frame story of 1923 became constant bestsellers in the 2010s. In April 2017, the Cabinet Office deleted historical evidence and acknowledgement of the massacre from their website. Beginning 2017, Tokyo mayor Yuriko Koike broke decades of precedent by refusing to acknowledge the massacre or offer condolences to the descendants of survivors, saying that whether a massacre occurred is a matter of historical debate. In July 2020, Koike was re-elected as mayor of Tokyo in a landslide victory. In September 2020 a Japanese group held a rally in Sumida, Tokyo calling for a memorial to the massacre located in Yokoamichō Park to be demolished, saying that the massacre never happened and the memorial constituted "hate speech against our ancestors."
Literary and artistic portrayals.
Prewar narratives by Koreans frequently appealed to a Japanese readership to heal the wounds which were caused by ethnic divides, while in the immediate postwar period the "emperor system" was blamed for brainwashing massacre participants to act against their better instincts. After the 1970s such appeals to people's higher consciences faded away, and the massacre became part of a marker of indelible difference between the Japanese and Korean peoples and the Japanese people's willful ignorance of the massacre. Ri Kaisei's 1975 novel "Exile and Freedom" exemplifies this turning point with a central monologue: "Can you guarantee that it won't happen again right here and now? Even if you did, would your guarantees make Korean nightmares go away? No chance..." 
As the massacre passed out of living memory in the 1990s, it became hidden history to younger generations of Zainichi Koreans. In the 2015 novel "Green and Red" ("Midori to aka" 『緑と赤』), by Zainichi novelist (深沢潮), the Zainichi protagonist learns about the massacre by reading about it in a history book, which serves to give excess weight to her fears over anti-Korean sentiment. Fukazawa emphasizes that the narrator is driven to discover this history out of anxiety rather than having any preexisting historical understanding.
Director Oh Chongkong (吳充功, 오충공) made two documentary films about the pogrom: "Hidden Scars: The Massacre of Koreans from the Arakawa River Bank to Shitamachi in Tokyo" ("Kakusareta tsumeato: Tokyo aragawa dote shūhen kara Shitamachi no gyakusatsu" 隠された爪跡: 東京荒川土手周辺から下町の虐殺, 1983) and "The Disposed-of Koreans: The Great Kanto Earthquake and Camp Narashino" ("Harasagareta Chōsenjin: Kantō Daishinsai to Narashino shūyōjo" 払い下げられた朝鮮人: 関東大震災と習志野収容所, 1986).
There have been several plays about the massacre. The playwright and Esperantist Ujaku Akita wrote "Gaikotsu no buchō" (骸骨の舞跳) in 1924, decrying the culture of silence by Japanese; its first printing was banned by the Japanese censors. It was translated into Esperanto as "Danco de skeletoj" in 1927. The playwright Koreya Senda did not write about the violence explicitly, but adopted the pen name "Koreya" after he was mistaken for a Korean by the mob. In 1986, a Japanese playwright, Fukuchi Kazuyoshi (福地一義), discovered his father's diary, read the account of the massacre which is contained in it and wrote a play which is based on his father's account. The play was briefly revived in 2017.
In 2014, non fiction writer Katō Naoki documented the massacre in his book "September on the Streets of Tokyo" ("Kugatsu, Tōkyō no rojō de" 九月、東京の路上で). This book has also been translated into Esperanto. As of 2020, Katō continues to advocate on behalf of victims' families and fight against historical revisionism.

Miloš Havel

Miloš Havel (3 November 1899 – 25 February 1968) was a Czech film producer and studio executive. Havel was a director of the film production company Lucernafilm, which was founded by his father in 1912. He was also a chairman of the film studio A-B, which built its new studios in Barrandov in 1932. He remained in charge of the studio during German occupation of Czechoslovakia. After World War II his wartime activities were criticized heavily, and he was put on trial for charges relating to collaboration with Nazi Germany. Though acquitted, he was banned from working in the film industry. He left the country and settled in Munich. He was the uncle of Czech president Václav Havel.
Career.
Havel ran the movie theater Lucerna Palace in Prague and later established the Barrandov Studios. During the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, Havel was forced to sell his share in Barrandov Studios but he remained in charge, and protected its staff from forced labour in Germany. At that time, Barrandov Studios produced newsreels and propaganda films for the government of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia as well as Czech productions. Havel was later credited with using his influence in the Protectorate to enable Lída Baarová, the former mistress of Joseph Goebbels, to perform in what have become some of her best films.
Following World War II, Havel was denounced from a variety of quarters for his wartime activities; though sometimes the accusations were politically motivated, even Havel family friend Jaromír Kopecký privately confided in Václav Havel his opinion that Havel was a Nazi collaborator.
Havel attempted to emigrate, but his exit visa was denied. In March 1949, he was arrested and put on trial on charges related to collaboration with Nazi Germany. The prosecution also alleged that he had used Lucerna Palace to fulfill his "perverted cravings" for young men. Ultimately cleared of the charges against him due to lack of evidence, he was nevertheless banned from working in the film industry as "morally unfit", and Barrandov Studios was nationalized. Havel attempted to skip the country in 1949, but was arrested by Soviet authorities and deported back to Czechoslovakia where he was sentenced to one year of labor. Released early due to poor health, he went to stay with the family of Václav Havel, receiving a mixed welcome on his arrival with Václav Havel's mother telling Havel the family had experienced "enough troubles already because of you".
Havel left the country a second time in 1952, ultimately settling in Munich where he filed suit against UFA GmbH for not paying for its wartime use of Barrandov. Havel used the proceeds from his successful lawsuit to go into business in Munich.
Personal life and legacy.
Havel was the uncle of Václav Havel. In 1999, Václav Havel organized a hundredth birthday party for his late uncle. A film on the life of Miloš Havel, with a screenplay by Jan Novák, has been in development since 2016.
In a review of Havel's biography, Anna Batistová wrote that "His short membership in the National Fascist League, his connections to Freemasons, Czech and German intelligence, and the disclosure of one of his friends as a double agent just add to the ambiguity, which, on the one hand, does not allow us to paint his character simply black or white. On the other hand, as the author of his biography argues, this ambiguity probably allowed him to help the domestic film industry, and to ultimately save it from German hands."

Burgabo lies at the mouth of the Burgabo River and is connected via a dirt road to Kamboni, the southernmost town in Somalia, away at the Kenyan border. The connections with the sparsely populated inland and towards the north consist of barely accessible paths. The district capital Badhaadhe lies to the northwest. Offshore are reefs and the Bajuni Islands, which extend northeastward to Kismayo.
On the northern edge of the town, there are extensive charcoal storage sites; charcoal is produced in the hinterland and exported from Burgabo to the Arabian Peninsula via dhow. This export is banned by the United Nations Security Council because the Islamic terror group Al-Shabaab is financed by the proceeds.
Burgabo has a tropical savanna climate with an average annual temperature of 27.2 °C. The hottest month is April with an average of 28.8 °C; the coolest month is July, averaging 25.6 °C. The annual precipitation amounts to approximately . The dry season is from January to March, followed by a rainy season from April to July. After that, rainfall regularly falls with a small peak in October. The wettest month is May when there is then about , more than a quarter of the annual total. The annual fluctuations can also be considerable.
History.
Greco-Roman.
The area is believed to correspond with the ancient emporium of Nikon, which is described in the 1st century CE Greco-Roman travelogue the "Periplus of the Erythraean Sea".
The archaeogical site (known by the early 20th century name "Port Dunford") contains a number of ancient ruins, including several pillar tombs. Prior to its collapse, one these structures' pillars stood 11 meters high from the ground, making it the tallest tower of its kind in the wider region.
Additionally, the area features a square edifice covered with a low, dome-shaped vault. It is one of the main local standing structures.
In 1913, Haywood reportedly found at Port Dunford a large collection of old coins, along with a vessel similar to a Greek amphora. He later disposed of the amphora pieces, and the vessel was also said to have been crushed during a storm. In 1930, Hayward showed the coins to an official with the British Museum, H. Mattingly. 87 pieces in total, they ranged in date from the 3rd century BCE to the early 4th century CE. Among the coins were 17 copper mints from the Ptolemy III to Ptolemy V dynasties of Ptolemaic Egypt, five pieces of uncertain origin dating from the 1st to 3rd centuries BCE, six pieces that had been minted under Imperial Rome between the reigns of Nero and Antoninus Pius, forty-six coins ranging from Roman Emperors Maximinus II to Constans, six mints derived from the Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate, and seven pieces from Ottoman Egypt.
Early trading.
Based on the archaeological finds, Mortimer Wheeler suggested that Port Dunford was likely a trading station from at least the Roman period. In 1955, he and Dr. A.G. Mathew in turn visited the area. They discovered porcelain, pottery and building remains dating from the 16th century onwards.
19th century.
Following an agreement between the German East Africa Company and Sultan Ali ibn Ismail of Kismayo at the end of 1886, a German trading station called Hohenzollernhafen was established at Wubushi (Burgabo) Bay. At that time, the entire southern part of the Somali coast was nominally in the hands of the Sultanate of Zanzibar, but the Germans circumvented that problem by concluding a protection treaty with Ali ibn Ismail, who was hostile to Zanzibar.
After the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty of 1890, the area came under British suzerainty and the port was renamed Port Durnford (also Port Dunford or Wubushi).
20th century.
In 1905, the area was described as follows:
Port Durnford formed part of the East Africa Protectorate (first part of Tanaland province and later Jubaland) until, along with the rest of Jubaland, was ceded to the Italians in 1924 when it became known as Bur Gavo. First part of Trans-Juba, it became part of Italian Somaliland in 1926 and, with independence in 1960, part of Somalia.
21st century.
At the beginning of the 21st century, the town numbered just under 4,000 residents, similar to the population at the start of the 20th century (about 3,500 residents). In the Somali Civil War, the city was a haven for various Islamist groups, and the population fell to around 300 in 2011. Expeditionary Kenya Defence Forces and Somali Armed Forces of the Federal Government of Somalia, supported by French naval artillery and U.S. air strikes, occupied the area of Burgabo at the end of October 2011 in the campaign against Al-Shabaab terrorists.

Sarah Howard, Countess of Suffolk

Sarah Howard, Countess of Suffolk (died 27 May 1776), formerly Sarah Inwen, was the wife of Henry Howard, 10th Earl of Suffolk, and subsequently the wife of Lucius Cary, 7th Viscount Falkland. 
Sarah Inwen was the daughter of Thomas Inwen, a brewer of Southwark, and his wife, Sarah Hucks, and was distantly related to Jane Austen. She married the Earl of Suffolk on 13 May 1735. Her father's money appears to have been one of the attractions for him. The earl died in 1745, aged 39, leaving no surviving children. The earldom passed to Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Berkshire, a great grandson of the 1st Earl.
Sarah remarried, her second husband being Lucius Cary, 7th Viscount Falkland, whom she married on 10 October 1752 as his second wife; he had previously been married to Jane Butler. Thereafter, Sarah's surname became Cary, and she was known as Viscountess Falkland. Viscount Falkland had four surviving children from his first marriage and none from his second marriage.
Her will, proved in June 1776, contained bequests to a number of charitable causes, including St George's Hospital and Christ Church Hospital, as well as bequests to many individuals who were friends or servants. Her house, Widford Hall, was left to a relative on her mother's side, William Hucks. She stipulated that she should be buried at St Mary's Church, Widford, Essex, and that her grave should take the form of a pyramid. The resulting monument was designed by George Gibson and erected in 1778. Her husband, the viscount, lived until 1785.

A point guard, he played college basketball for Loyola University Chicago, and was the 2018 Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year. Custer briefly played professional basketball for Śląsk Wroclaw of the Polish Basketball League. He then became the Director of Player Development for Loyola's men's team, and later for Oklahoma. 
High school career.
Custer played high school basketball at Blue Valley Northwest High School in Overland Park, Kansas, where he and future Loyola teammate Ben Richardson led the team to back-to-back state championships. Custer ultimately committed early to play for coach Fred Hoiberg at Iowa State. He also received offers from Oklahoma State and Kansas State, and Kansas coach Bill Self told him he was good enough to play for the Jayhawks but they had too many guards at that moment. 
College career.
As a freshman in the 2014–15 season, Custer played sparingly behind the Cyclones' Monté Morris, one of the top point guards in the Big 12 Conference. Custer chose to transfer following the season, after scoring 13 points in 12 games. He ultimately re-joined Richardson under coach Porter Moser at Loyola after Moser took him to lunch and met with his parents. After sitting out the 2015–16 season per National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) transfer rules, Custer immediately joined the Ramblers' starting lineup, allowing star Milton Doyle to play off the ball. Custer averaged 11.6 points and 3.1 assists per game as a sophomore. 
As a redshirt junior, Custer led the Ramblers to the Missouri Valley Conference regular-season title, despite missing five games to an ankle injury. Custer was named the MVC Player of the Year. Following a run through the 2018 MVC Tournament, Custer and the Ramblers entered the 2018 NCAA Tournament as an 11 seed. After a first-round win over the Miami Hurricanes, Custer led the team to a 63–62 second-round win over Tennessee. Custer hit the game-winner with 3.7 seconds left to advance the Ramblers to the Sweet 16. He ended up leading the Ramblers to the Final Four while averaging 13.2 points and 4.2 assists per game. At the close of the 2017-18 season, Custer was awarded the Lou Henson Award for top mid-major player in the country.
Professional career.

March 1–3, 2018 nor'easter

The March 1–3, 2018 nor'easter was a powerful nor'easter that caused major impacts in the Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States. It originated as the northernmost low of a stationary front over the Midwest on March 1, which moved eastward into the Northeast later that night. A new low pressure system rapidly formed off the coast on March 2 as it slowly meandered near the coastline. It peaked later that day and brought hurricane-force winds to coastal New England before gradually moving out to sea by March 3. Producing over of snow in some areas, it was one of the most significant March snowstorms in many areas, particularly in Upstate New York. In other areas, it challenged storm surge records set by other significant storms, such as Hurricane Sandy. It was unofficially named "Winter Storm Riley" by The Weather Channel. 
Although the most severe damage was caused by flooding as well as snow, unusually high tides and storm surges along the coast, wind and downed trees caused massive inland power outages, with the number of outages as high as 1.9 million at one point. By March 4, least 9 people were known to have been killed as a result of the storm, with 5 of them being killed by falling trees or branches. Recovery efforts were later hampered as a second nor'easter began to impact the area just a few days after the first one struck.
Meteorological history.
A stationary front was draped over the central United States on the last day of February 2018. During this time period, dangerous flash flooding occurred as a result. On March 1, one of the northernmost lows split from the boundary and began tracking northwards. Tracking into colder air near the border between the U.S and Canada, snow broke out in the eastern half of the Midwest; the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) began issuing storm summaries later that day. Overnight into the early morning hours of March 2, a new low formed and rapidly strengthened off the coast of New Jersey, while snow began to slowly increase in coverage near Pennsylvania and southern New York.
Rapid deepening of the low continued as it moved slowly westward, before it bottomed out around or so later that evening. Intrusion of cold air caused heavy wet snow to break out closer to the coast, resulting in snow engulfing much of the Tri-State Area, including New York City and areas further south. Winds also increased as the pressure gradient of the system increased, with gusts reaching as high as in some areas. Gradually, the storm also began to move out to sea, with the precipitation shield of the system receding from the coast. Consequently, by the early morning hours of March 3, the WPC terminated storm summaries on the storm after it moved far enough away from the East Coast, while also maintaining peak intensity. The system weakened over the next few days, before it split into two systems on March 5, one of which became a hurricane-force low.
Preparations and impact.

Paul Erickson (activist)

Paul Erickson (born 1962) is an American conservative political operative, lawyer, and businessperson. He has been involved in several Republican presidential campaigns. He has strong ties to the National Rifle Association and Russian interests and in 2017 was subject to federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. In November 2019, Erickson pleaded guilty to federal charges of wire fraud and money laundering in connection with an effort to defraud investors in an oil development scheme. He was sentenced to seven years in federal prison in July 2020, but was granted a full pardon in January 2021, shortly before Donald Trump's last day in office.
Education.
Erickson's hometown is Vermillion, South Dakota. He attended the University of South Dakota and then transferred to Yale University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics and political science in 1984. In 1980, while at USD, Erickson coordinated a youth campaign for Representative Jim Abdnor. For a year between his time at USD and Yale, Erickson served as the national treasurer of the College Republicans in Washington, D.C., whose staff at the time included Grover Norquist, Ralph Reed, and Jack Abramoff. Abramoff later wrote, "To every college Republican who contacted the national office, Paul Erickson was by far the most impressive person they had ever encountered in politics."
Also while in college, Erickson wrote "Fritzbusters", a comedy routine that was critical of Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale which had similarities to the then newly released film "Ghostbusters" (1984). Erickson and some fellow College Republicans performed Fritzbusters at the 1984 Republican National Convention and later as a warm-up act for Ronald Reagan at some rallies during the 1984 United States presidential election. The campaign stopped running Fritzbusters after more than 100 students wearing Fritzbusters shirts heckled Mondale in September 1984. Erickson earned a Juris Doctor (law) degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1988.
Political consulting.
In addition to his political work while in college, Erickson worked in 1985 as the deputy campaign manager for Richard Viguerie’s unsuccessful campaign for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia.
Frustrated by the tax increase led by President George H. W. Bush, Erickson served as the national political director / campaign manager for the 1992 presidential campaign of Pat Buchanan. A biographer of Buchanan later said Erickson was "the best there was at the price Pat could afford."
Erickson later served as an advisor to Mitt Romney for both of his presidential campaigns. He is also a former board member of the American Conservative Union, the group that organizes the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). He was a friend of Andrew Breitbart.
Stephen Moore, founder of the right-leaning limited-government group Club for Growth often relies on what he calls Erickson's “clever and creative ideas.” However, Lee Schoenbeck, a former Republican Watertown Representative to the South Dakota House of Representatives, has called him "the single biggest phony I’ve ever met in South Dakota politics." Casey Phillips, a South Dakota Republican political consultant, has said of Erickson, "He likes to put people in touch with people. He’s a person that’s at the center of relationships all over the place."
Business undertakings.
Erickson worked as an executive producer of "Red Scorpion" (1988), an anticommunist action film produced by Jack Abramoff.
From 1993 to 1994, Erickson acted as a media adviser, agent, and lawyer for John Wayne Bobbitt, whose wife Lorena had cut off his penis with a kitchen knife. Erickson booked Bobbitt on an international "Love Hurts" tour during which Bobbitt made appearances on television shows such as "The Howard Stern Show".
In 1994, Erickson obtained a $30,000 contract with Jack Abramoff to lobby for entrance into the United States by Mobutu Sese Seko, the military dictator of the Democratic Republic of the Congo who had been banned from the entering the United States due to the corrupt and dictatorial nature of his regime. Mobutu sought a visit to the United Nations to claim credit for this offer, but his visa request was ultimately denied due to his past human rights abuses.
Senior care and medical technologies.
In 1997, Erickson founded Compass Care, a senior living company based in South Dakota dedicated to developing non-nursing home care options for seniors in the Midwest. This venture led to senior care consulting spinoffs, independent living communities and the licensing of medical technology. Erickson and his companies have amassed at least seven civil court judgments against them over the years. In two such cases, lawsuits by investors in Compass Care alleged that Erickson had predicted investment returns of 25–100% but that neither investor received any returns and that Erickson had reneged on his promises to refund the original investments. One investor won a judgment for $115,417 in 2003 while another obtained a judgment for $190,000 in 2008. Two of Erickson's lawyers withdrew from the second case, one after Erickson wrote him a bad check.
Prison sentence and pardon.
On February 6, 2019, Erickson was indicted by a grand jury in the US District of South Dakota for wire fraud and money laundering in connection with his activities with Compass Care and for defrauding investors of Investing with Dignity, a start-up wheelchair development and manufacturing venture. He pleaded not guilty and was released on bond.
In November 2019, Erickson pleaded guilty to federal charges of wire fraud and money laundering in connection with an effort to defraud investors in an oil development scheme. He was sentenced to seven years in federal prison on July 6, 2020, and granted a full presidential pardon on January 20, 2021, Donald Trump's last day in office as president of the United States.
NRA and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.
Erickson has strong ties to both the National Rifle Association and the Russian gun rights community. He has supported Maria Butina, a former assistant to Aleksandr Torshin and the founder of a Russian gun rights group called "The Right to Bear Arms". In 2016, Erickson and Butina set up a South Dakota business named "Bridges, LLC", which Erickson later said was created to provide financial assistance for Butina's graduate studies.
During Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016, Erickson attempted to develop a back-channel between the NRA and the Russian government. In May 2016, Erickson sent an e-mail with the subject line "Kremlin Connection" to Trump campaign adviser Rick Dearborn asking Dearborn and then-Senator Jeff Sessions for advice on setting up a meeting between Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin at an annual NRA convention. After Trump won the presidential election in November 2016, Erickson said he was advising his transition team.
Erickson, Butina, and Torshin have been part of an investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Torshin has also been the subject of a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigations into whether the Russian government attempted to illegally funnel money to the NRA in order to help Trump win the presidency. In July 2018 Butina was arrested by the FBI and charged with conspiring to act as an unregistered agent of the Russian Federation. In Butina's indictment, federal prosecutors said an unnamed American political operative, later identified as Erickson, had worked with Butina to arrange introductions to influential people inside the U.S. and to advance Russian interests. Butina pleaded guilty in December 2018, saying that she had engaged in a conspiracy against the United States with Erickson and Torshin. Meanwhile Erickson was under investigation by federal law enforcement agencies for the same offense.
Religious activities.
Erickson served a term on the board of directors of the Institute for Lutheran Theology.
In 1997 Erickson helped to organize a religious revival service on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Promise Keepers, an Evangelical Christian men's organization. Hundreds of thousands of men participated in the day-long service.
Personal life.
Erickson is single and has never married. He has homes in New York, Los Angeles, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
According to prosecutor charges against Butina, Erickson and Butina lived together. Butina's defense alleged a long time relationship with Erickson.

The Weraerai ethnonym was formed from their word for no, namely "wirai/werai".
Language.
The Weraerai language, "Wiraiari", is thought to belong to the Wiradjuri branch of the Wiradhuric languages with Robert M. W. Dixon stating that it may be a further dialect of the former.
Country.
Norman Tindale estimated their lands as extending over some , on the northern side of the Gwydir River from Moree to Bingara. It took in Yallaroi, and their northernmost extension ran to Warialda and Gilgil Creek, and from Inverell to north of Wallangra on the Macintyre River. Their western frontier was at Garah.
Mythology and social rite of initiation.
In one early report by the Reverend Greenway, the Weraerai were said to share much mythology with the Gamilaraay. Using European analogies, he described their supreme god as Baiame, creator of the "murri" (aboriginal people) who had an earthly regent called "Turramūlan", whose name meant 'one-legged' since 'his locomotive instruments, or feet and legs, (were) in the form of an Indian yale, all on one side; hence his name, signifying 'one-legged'. His consort "Muni Burribian" was delegated with the task of initiating women into the domestic arts. Turramūlan's presence is summoned by the whirling of a bullroarer during the rites of initiation at a bora circle.
Soon the leaders appeared by a long train of aborigines in single file. They were all painted in red, yellow, and white figures, the white prevailing in stripes down their arms and thighs: each was girded with a specially constructed belt or girdle of opossum known as a "ghūtūr," and fringed around by a sort of short kilt made of split opossum, native cat, and squirrel skins respectively, according to the totem to which they belonged. Their hair was dressed in various ways and well combed and greased, then frosted over with swandown or that of other birds, each had round their head under the hair, at the sides and back, a band netted closely and broad where it passed over the forehead, this is known as a "ngooloomere" (from the covering the forehead) this was of a great variety of colour amongst them. Each carried in his left hand a small packet of very fine ashes or white or grey earth dust, the en closing material was of soft bark, this was struck by the right hand, thereby emitting some of the powder within, which floating in the air forms a misty cloud all over. The blows were given in solemn cadence chanted in a subdued voice by all, and added much to the real solemnity of the scene...they entered upon another prepared enclosure, in which lay an enormous representation of a serpent made of stuff mud or clay and branded across by yellow, red, and white adornments and bands...Round this figure the whole body marched in much the same style and manner as at their first entrance on the scene, but bending forward occasionally as at certain points fixed simultaneously with a sort of inclination of the body as if expressing reverence. The motions throughout were made with all the accuracy and precision of the most perfectly drilled troops or well taught dancers. When this function was completed and open space prepared there, they formed a square by regularly preserved ranks, and commenced a grand corroboree, moving in unbroken mass forward a space, then backward, then from left to right, then from right to left in one unbroken order, and with faultless precision as to time and manner, their voices and limbs.
History of contact.
The Weraerai were reportedly one of the tribes, including the Gamilaraay, that were killed during punitive expeditions that took place and peaked with the Waterloo Creek massacre of 1838.

Barton (1801 ship)

Barton was launched in Bermuda, probably in 1799, and built of Bermuda cedar. She first appears in registers under the "Barton" name in 1801 as a slave ship. The French captured her in 1802 before she had delivered the slaves she had purchased for her second voyage.
Career.
"Barton" entered "Lloyd's Register" in 1801 with J. Wilson, master, Seller &amp; Co., owner, and trade Liverpool–Africa. She entered the "Register of Shipping" in 1802 with the same master and owner, and origin.
First slave voyage (1801-1802): Captain John Wilson sailed from Liverpool on 19 November 1801, bound for West Africa. "Barton" started acquiring slaves on 12 December 1812 in the area between Rio Nuñez and the Assini River. She arrived at St Thomas, Danish West Indies on 28 July 1802. She had embarked 185 slaves and landed 166, for a loss rate of 10.3%. She left St Thomas on 13 September and arrived back at Liverpool on 17 October. 
Second slave voyage (1802-capture): Captain Wilson sailed from Liverpool with 21 crew members, bound for West Africa. "Barton" embarked an estimated 310 slaves at Rio Nuñez. On her way to the West Indies the French captured her. Her captors took her into Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe, where they landed 279 slaves.
"Lloyd's List" reported on 6 December 1803 that "Barton" had been captured and taken into Guadeloupe.
Post-script.
A report from Charleston, South Carolina, stated that the master of the British vessel "Barton" had come from Guadeloupe and had reported to the Collector of the Customs at Charleston that a French privateer had captured an American ship and a brig, both of New York. The ship was "Hopewell", Sisson, master, and the brig "Rockland", Akins, master. The American lost 16 men killed and wounded, and the French several killed and wounded. When "Rockland" struck the "French people of colour" who were aboard her jumped overboard, drowning themselves. The context was that the French had banned all trade with Haiti during the Haitian Revolution and were treating as pirates any armed vessels conducting such trade. Furthermore, in this particular case one of "Rockland"s passengers was said to have been a black general, and she was carrying mail to Haiti. The French authorities in Guadeloupe condemned "Rockwell" as a prize of war.

Prostitution in California

Prostitution in California is illegal. 
Recent history.
In November 2012, the Californian government passed Proposition 35 through ballot initiative, meaning that anyone who is a registered sex offender—including sex workers and those whose actions were not Internet-based—to turn over a list of all their Internet identifiers and service providers to law enforcement. The law expands the definition of trafficking to anyone who benefits financially from prostitution, regardless of intent, and sex workers have not only opposed the further criminalization of their work, but also the portrayal of all sex workers as victims that the law perpetuates. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Northern California (ACLU-NC) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed a federal class-action lawsuit to block implementation of unconstitutional provisions of Proposition 35 in mid-2013 and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco heard oral arguments on September 10, 2013. As of February 12, 2014, further information on the outcome of this lawsuit are yet to be published.
A media article published on February 8, 2014, provided details of a police sting operation in the Sonoma County area of California and the police officers involved experienced difficulties with the very high number of respondents to the false advertisement that they published on the Internet. After several hours, 10 men were arrested, followed by the arrest of former prosecutor and judicial candidate John LemMon—the authorities involved stated that the market is overwhelming. At the same time, the county District Attorney's Office is establishing a version of the FOPP for Sonoma County and the program will be active in mid-2014.
On February 11, 2014, sex worker activists protested a San Francisco anti-trafficking panel discussion held by the San Francisco Collaborative Against Human Trafficking, as they believe that it will further criminalize adults in the sex industry. Maxine Doogan, an organizer with the Erotic Service Providers Union, stated: "Their goal is to disappear the whole sex industry by criminalizing the people that participate in it. Targeting our customers is a flawed approach." Doogan also included in a press release announcing the protest that the term "john" as a descriptor for sex work clients is demeaning and dehumanizes customers.
Legal challenge.
The "Erotic Service Providers Legal, Educational and Research Project" on behalf of 3 ex-sex workers and a client, challenged the state's prostitution laws in court. They submitted that the prostitution laws violate the rights of people to engage in consensual sex and cited a Supreme Court 2003 ruling that revoked laws against gay sex acts. In October 2017, the Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco allowed the challenge to proceed. However the U.S. Court of Appeals rejected the challenge in January 2018 on the grounds that prohibition of prostitution was in the public interest.
Sex Workers Outreach Project.
A chapter of the Sex Workers Outreach Project (SWOP)—a national advocacy group and decriminalization effort founded by and for sex workers in 2003—exists in the Bay Area of San Francisco and its members meet on a monthly basis. The chapter represents the sex-positive and activist ethos that underpins the local sex-workers' movement that also included the East Bay's Lusty Lady cooperative that, while it was open, remained the only business of its kind globally to be fully unionized and worker-owned. San Francisco is where the American sex-workers' rights movement was founded and decriminalization measures in Berkeley and San Francisco were garnering support as early as 2004.
John school.
In the city of San Francisco, a First Offender Prostitution Program (FOPP), also known as "john school", has been established as a court diversion program for apprehended clients of the sex industry. The SAGE Project, one of the founders of the initiative, defines the FOPP as a "demand reduction strategy" and explains the program's philosophy in the following manner:
FOPP was founded on the theory that if male consumers had a better understanding of the risks and impact of their behavior when soliciting prostitution, they would cease to do so ... Understanding that everyone has different motivations, triggers and fears that inspire them to act, FOPP utilizes a variety of perspectives so that consumers are exposed to a range of experts who engage with the issue from different angles. This approach, the founders believed, would deliver a holistic understanding of the commercial sex industry that would empower sustained behavior change for a diverse set of individuals ... The FOPP model educates consumers on the harmful effects their actions have on themselves, those engaged in the sex industry, and their community.

Valentina Bergamaschi

Valentina Bergamaschi (born 22 January 1997) is an Italian football striker who plays for A.C. Milan Women of Serie A. In 2018 A.C. Milan obtained the playing licence of ACF Brescia Femminile, whom Bergamaschi had joined in 2017 after three seasons in Swiss football with Rapid Lugano, FF Lugano 1976, and FC Neunkirch. With Neunkirch she won the Nationalliga A championship and the Swiss Women's Cup in 2016–2017.
A member of the senior Italy women's national football team since 2016, Bergamaschi also has third place medals from the 2014 UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship and the 2014 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup.
Club career.
Bergamaschi, who was born in Varese but grew up and lived with her parents in Cittiglio, began competitive activity by joining FC Caravate, a club that promotes football in the homonymous Italian town, playing with boys from the age of nine years old.
In May 2011, Bergamaschi was called up to the representative under-15 team of Lombardy to participate in the "Torneo delle Regioni" (Tournament of the Regions) held in Chianciano Terme from 26 June to 3 July 2011. During the tournament, which the representative of Lombardy won by beating the Veneto in the final, Bergamaschi scored one of the goals and was noticed by the selectors of the Italy women's national under-17 football team, being called at the end of the tournament for a training camp with coaches Enrico Sbardella and Rita Guarino.
As a promising young player from Lombardy, Bergamaschi was contacted by a number of football clubs in higher divisions, but decided to sign for Alto Verbano, a club that was about to compete in the 2011–2012 Serie D Italian regional Championship, then at the lowly fifth level of Italian women's football. With Bergamaschi showing her qualities from the first match of the season Alto Verbano topped the league table, and retained their position until the end of the championship, gaining promotion to Serie C for 2012–2013.
During the 2014 summer transfer market, she joined Rapid Lugano of the Swiss Nationalliga B. Bergamaschi helped the club secure promotion to Nationalliga A at the end of the 2014–2015 season. Before the start of 2015–2016, the women's team left the men's club, becoming Lugano 1976. Bergamaschi decided to remain with the newly independent club for the following season. Ahead of the 2016–17 campaign, she transferred to FC Neunkirch.
She won a league and Swiss Women's Cup double in the 2016–2017 season with Neunkirch, also finishing league top-scorer with 24 goals. But in June 2017 she became a free agent when Neunkirch withdrew from the Swiss championship and folded. In early July she agreed to join Brescia, gaining her first opportunity to play in Serie A.
In July 2018 she signed as a full-time professional with newly formed A.C. Milan Women, who had obtained Brescia's Serie A playing licence.
International career.
She was called into the senior national team for the 2016 International Women's Football Tournament of Manaus.
FOOTBALL CAREER TRANSFERS AND STATISTICS.
We are going to show you the list of football clubs and seasons in which Valentina Bergamaschi has played. It includes the total number of appearance (caps), substitution details, goals, yellow and red cards stats.

2018 Northeast Conference Women's Basketball Tournament

The 2018 Northeast Conference Women's Basketball Tournament was the concluding event of the 2017–18 season of the Northeast Conference (NEC), held from March 7–11, 2018. Unlike most NCAA Division I basketball conference tournaments, the NEC tournament does not include all of the league's teams. The tournament instead features only the top eight teams from regular-season NEC play. Regular-season co-champion Saint Francis of Pennsylvania won the tournament and with it the NEC's automatic berth in the 2018 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament.
Format.
For the first time, the NEC Women's Basketball Tournament did not use what the conference calls a "complete high-seed hosting" format, in which all games are played at the home of the higher seed. In addition, the tournament did not reseed teams after each round, a format it had used since the 2011 edition. Instead, each half of the bracket was hosted by one of the league's two top seeds. The final continues to be played at the home court of the top remaining seed.
Seeds.
The NEC uses the following criteria for breaking two-way ties in the conference standings:
The procedure for breaking ties in which three or more teams are involved will not be discussed here, since no such ties existed this season.

John Morgan (swimmer)

John Morgan is an American swimmer who won 13 gold medals across two Paralympic Games. He made his debut at the 1984 Summer Paralympics where he won five golds, then returned at the 1992 Games in Barcelona where he medalled in all ten events in which he competed. Morgan's success at these Games included setting six world records; throughout his career he set a total of 14 world records. He was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2008 and the United States Association of Blind Athletes' Hall of Fame in 2011.
Biography.
Morgan was born in San Gabriel, California, and was taught to swim in the ocean at Huntington Beach by his parents. He joined the local swim team and worked as a junior lifeguard. The family moved to Argentina, his father's home country, when Morgan was 13. Morgan was finding success as a competitive swimmer and he completed a 20K marathon river swim at the age of 15. While exercising, an accident with a springed exerciser he was holding left Morgan with two detached retinas. Over the next two years his eyesight deteriorated, until in 1980 at age 18 he lost all vision. In 1984, while studying mathematics at University of California, Irvine, he was selected for the All-American Team for open water swimming.
Morgan was competing as a blind swimmer in B1 category events when he attended the International Games for the Disabled, subsequently known as the Paralympic Games, in 1984. He found great success, finishing the tournament with five gold medals. In 1988 he attended the University of California, Berkeley to do his master's degree and consequently missed the Paralympic Games that year. After completing his studies in 1991, he took part in a open water marathon in Argentina which he completed in 12th position with a time of 8 hours and 24 minutes. Morgan returned for the 1992 Games in Barcelona, again finding success by winning eight golds in backstroke, butterfly, freestyle, and medley events, as well as silver in two breaststroke distances.
Morgan was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2008 and the United States Association of Blind Athletes' Hall of Fame in 2011.
Aside from swimming, Morgan has pushed himself in other athletic endeavours, including tandem cycling and the successful ascent of Mount Kilimanjaro.

Wilding Picture Productions

Wilding Picture Productions, Inc. (also known as Wilding Studios or Wilding) was a major supplier of audio-visual communications services, involved primarily in the production and distribution of motion pictures, slidefilms, TV commercials, and business shows. It produced industrial films for many corporations on a wide range of subjects, from expounding proper use of the company's products to productivity. During World War II, it was the main supplier of war-related films for the United States Armed Forces.
History.
1914–1936: Detroit period.
The company was founded in Detroit by Norman Wilding (1892–1947), in 1914.
1937–1966: Chicago Essanay Studio period.
In 1937, Wilding moved into the Essanay Building in Chicago, once owned by Essanay Film Manufacturing Company. Over the next few decades, Wilding became one of the country's biggest producers of industrial films. At its peak, the company owned studios in Chicago, Detroit and New York. In 1958, Wilding produced around 100 to 125 major business films, at a total cost of about 130 million dollars. Its customers included Ford, Chrysler, Goodyear, General Electric, U.S. Steel, Alcoa, and Amoco
During the Second World War, Wilding produced many films for the US Armed Services. These included training films such as "Combat Fatigue: Insomnia (1945)""," an educational film used to teach soldiers how to overcome insomnia; and product promotion films such as "Heritage for Victory (ca.1940s)" and "Army on Wheels (1940)""," which concentrated on vehicles and technologies used in World War II.
1967–Now: Closure.
In 1967, Wilding was acquired by local Chicago projector manufacturer Bell &amp; Howell, which ultimately closed Wilding's Chicago unit in 1972. Bell &amp; Howell donated the real estate to Ch. 11, which in turn sold the property. Wilding's exhibits division and creative operations for the John Deere account remained in business in downtown Chicago until 1985.
Wilding was sold to Maritz, LLC on January 4, 1981. Maritz merged Wilding with their existing film and events production subsidiary, Communico, and named the new company Maritz Communications. Wilding's heavily unionized labor force did not blend well with Maritz's non-union culture, and over the subsequent five years, Maritz sold or closed down several Wilding operating units. These included event staging equipment rental, film editing, sound studios and major exhibit production.
Maritz Communications closed in 1992, and film and events clients were serviced by Maritz, LLC. In 1997, Maritz, LLC spun-off video production operations to Visiontracks, and meetings and events to EventSource. Maritz, LLC kept a creative group employed until 2009, when all media and event operations were closed.

Hammarbyleden

Hammarbyleden is an artificial waterway in Stockholm which connects Lake Mälaren with Saltsjön, the westernmost bay of the Baltic Sea. The waterway is located along the southern edge of Södermalm, one of Stockholm's many islands.
The waterway is composed mostly of interconnected natural bodies of water, which were expanded and dredged in the late-1910s and 1920s; the waterway was opened in 1929. A water lock was constructed as part of the project to account for the water level variation between Lake Mälaren and the Baltic Sea.
Route.
The waterway begins at Liljeholmsviken (near the eastern edge of Lake Mälaren) where it flows east into Årstaviken. At the eastern end of Årstaviken is the water lock, called , which lowers the water level from Årstaviken into Hammarby Sjö (Hammarby Lake). The final connection between Hammarby Lake and Saltsjön is made through the . The canal meets Saltsjön near the wharf of Masthamnen.

Nicolas Brigaut

Nicolas Brigaut (1653–1686) was a French pirate and buccaneer active in the Caribbean. He was closely associated with fellow corsair Michel de Grammont.
History.
Brigaut first went to sea in 1679, surviving a shipwreck before joining the "flibustier" (French buccaneer) fleet of Sieur de Grammont. Over the next few years he was part of their expeditions attacking Cumana, Maracaibo, and Cartagena. By 1683 he had risen to the position of quartermaster aboard the ship "La Mutine" commanded by Michiel Andrieszoon. Andrieszoon sailed up the American east coast to Boston to resupply in late 1684. While there Brigaut purchased a 40-ton sloop of his own.
Now in command of his own vessel, he and other buccaneers gathered off the coast of Caracas for another raid which never materialized. The pirates dispersed, and Brigaut left to find Grammont, with whom he sailed in a 1685 attack on Campeche alongside Laurens de Graaf. While there Brigaut transferred to command of a captured Spanish galliot. Afterwards he sailed for Roatan, where he rendezvoused with Grammont’s ship "Le Hardi". Grammont and Brigaut conspired to attack the Spanish again at Saint Augustine, Florida, possibly with help from English colonists in Charleston.
They arrived off Florida at the end of April 1686. Grammont sent Brigaut ahead to Matanzas Inlet to capture guides and interpreters and gather intelligence on Saint Augustine. Brigaut’s men captured several Indians and Spaniards but were attacked by a contingent of Spanish soldiers. Brigaut’s forces retreated to their ship; during the night a storm forced his ship aground. The Frenchmen tried to come ashore but met resistance, then failing to free the galliot, they returned to the beach and marched overland to await rescue by Grammont. The Governor of Florida sent additional soldiers who attacked Brigaut and his men, slaughtering over forty of them (including their Spanish prisoners) and leaving alive only Brigaut, a black sailor named Diego, and a young boy.
The Spanish Governor interrogated Brigaut and Diego, at first mistaking Brigaut for Spanish turncoat Alonso de Avesilla thanks to Brigaut having flown Spanish flags to disguise his ship. Brigaut revealed their plan to attack Saint Augustine and confirmed the involvement of men from the Carolinas. He also confessed that La Salle had established a French colony in Mississippi, which alarmed the Governor. Brigaut and Diego were hanged at the end of May 1686. Grammont himself tried approaching the coast in "Le Hardi" but was run aground just as Brigaut had been; his ship was lost with all hands.
The Lords Proprietors wrote to Governor James Colleton of South Carolina early the following year, warning him to restrain his colonists from dealing with pirates or attacking the Spanish. They cautioned that:
…the people of Carolina have received the pirates who have unjustly burned and robbed the houses of the Spaniards. Could any rational man doubt that the Spaniards would seek revenge, and would be justified in seeking it, if this be true? We have also been informed that a design was on foot in Carolina to take St. Augustine, which our Government was ready to countenance, being persuaded that they were justified by our clause permitting invaders to be pursued beyond the bounds of our province. But that clause means only a pursuit in heat of victory, not a granting of commissions and a deliberate invasion of the King of Spain's dominions.

Sanctify (song)

"Sanctify" is a song recorded by British synthpop band Years &amp; Years. Written by Olly Alexander and its producer Kid Harpoon, it was released on 7 March 2018 by Polydor Records, as the lead single from the band's second studio album, "Palo Santo" (2018). It was voted as the 3rd hottest record of the year 2018 as part of Annie Mac's hottest record of the year.
Release and background.
The band first teased the song via social media on 16 February 2018, with a cryptic video featuring a grainy footage of their "King" music video as well as ideograms, leading to speculation of an upcoming announcement. They later shared another video featuring a picture of lead singer Olly Alexander that encouraged fans to sign up to their mailing list. Their website, which was linked in the video captions, also hinted that something was "coming soon". On 2 March 2018, the band posted a video which revealed the song's title and release details.
According to "Nylon", "Sanctify" was inspired by Alexander's relationship with a straight man, in which "things became chaotic at a certain point". He explained: "There's so much that goes on in an experience like that. On the one hand, the guy is struggling with his sexuality and feeling unable to express himself as anything other than straight while also desiring me. I'm on the other side feeling like both a sinner and saint or a devil and angel, leading this guy down a path of 'sinfulness' while, at the same time, helping him explore his sexuality." The band's older songs "have been about [Alexander] and [his] life", but "Sanctify" was referred to as one of the "more sexually overt songs". Alexander stated that he has "felt more empowered to be even more confessional in [his] writing" and is "not shying away from certain topics anymore". He concluded by saying: "I feel like being gay is a blessing. I wanted that to come through in the song."
Composition.
"Sanctify" is a BDSM-referencing dance, dark pop, pop and R&amp;B song, with early 2000s pop music influences. Alexander told Beats 1: "Then the music side of it, I wanted something that felt like it could be Britney-era 'Slave 4 U' meets Timbaland or Neptunes... that's my favorite kind of stuff to listen to." He added in an interview with Capital: "When we were making it, it just sounded like a really nice blend of my favourite kind of old skool RnB, but also felt kinda fresh, so it felt like the best foot forward."
Music video.
The accompanying music video was directed by Fred Rowson. It was situated in an imaginary future metropolis called Palo Santo, where people are captured and made to dance as a form of entertainment for androids. It began with Alexander being taken to an audition. At first, he is restrained by a cuff around his neck. After it releases, he dances and emotes more freely. Alexander revealed in a press release: "It's the first part of a bigger jigsaw puzzle and my hope is that it confuses the hell out of people but also excites them in a mysterious and sensual way. We've deliberately hidden lots of different meanings and I want people to come up with their own interpretations, I'm asking people to jump down the rabbit hole with me and let their imagination run free."
Critical reception.
Robin Murray of "Clash" regarded the song as a piece of "potent, poised pop music" which "embraces creativity as a realm for reinvention". Bianca Gracie of Fuse felt that the song indicates "an unexpected but thrilling sonic direction", writing that it "takes a much sharper turn into dark-pop territory". Philip Cosores of "Uproxx" opined that it "sounds decidedly more Justin [Bieber]", despite Alexander's claim of Spears influences, "but either way, the pop bona fides of the track can't be denied".

Wessyngton (Cedar Hill, Tennessee)

Wessyngton is a historic mansion on a former tobacco plantation in Cedar Hill, Tennessee, U.S. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
The house was built in 1815 for Joseph Washington, his wife Mary née Cheatham, and their infant son George Augustine Washington (1815-1892). Washington developed it as a tobacco plantation, and his son continued to operate it for that commodity crop.
George served in the Tennessee General Assembly from 1873 to 1875. His son Joseph E. Washington followed him into politics, serving in the United States House of Representatives from 1887 to 1897. In 1860 George owned 274 slaves, who cultivated thousands of acres of land. After the war and emancipation, most of the freedmen stayed on the plantation, with some working as domestic servants for the family, and most as sharecroppers. In the 1890s, Joseph Washington and his wife commissioned portraits of some of their servants from noted artist Maria Howard Weeden of Huntsville, Alabama.
After Joseph's death, his widow Mary Bolling Kemp Washington owned the plantation from 1915 to 1938. After her death, it passed to their three children.
The Washingtons grew tobacco on the plantation, which was known as the largest tobacco plantation in the United States. It 1976 it was recognized as a Century Farm.
Architectural significance.
The house was designed in the Federal architectural style. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since May 6, 1971.

Euura destricta

Euura destricta is a species of sawfly belonging to the family Tenthredinidae (common sawflies). The larvae feed on the leaves of willow ("Salix" species).
Description of the gall.
These are simple galls with the leaf rolled, or folded downwards affecting one or both sides of the leaf. The female forms the gall before she lays her eggs, with the caterpillar feeding inside the fold. It will also feed on ungalled parts of the leaf, or other leaves. The gall is usually found on bay willow ("S. pentandra"), and can also be found on gray willow ("S. glauca") and tea-leaved willow ("S. phylicifolia").
Redfern et al. state that, in Great Britain, it is safe to identify the galls of this species and "Euura oblita" by the foodplants. "E. oblita" feeds on crack willow ("S. fragilis") and white willow ("S. alba"). In Great Britain, other "Euura" species do not form galls on these host plants.
Distribution.
The sawfly has been found in Finland, Great Britain (England and Scotland), Ireland and Sweden.

Conscription in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

Conscription in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is legal according to provisions in the current Constitution of the DRC, and formerly the Constitution of Zaire adopted in 1964. Although mandatory military service is not in effect in the DRC currently, many rebel groups and the Armed Forces have forced youths into service, including child soldiers.
Legal basis.
In Article 63 of the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it states that "All Congolese have the sacred right and duty to defend the country and its territorial integrity in the face of an external threat or aggression" and that "a compulsory military service may be established under the conditions prescribed by law." Previously, under the government of Mobutu Sese Seko, Article 30 of the Constitution of Zaire stated "All Zairians who become 18 are liable for military service; this may be replaced by a civilian service on conditions set out by law."
History.
The Mobutu regime made no attempt to enforce compulsory service. In March 1998, a national service center was established with about 300 instructors training 2,000 youths. The government of President Laurent Kabila planned to set 33 centers to train as many as 50,000 people. This was part of an effort to integrate former militias into a national army. Apparently Kabila planned on introducing national service for all citizens and creating a national army of 600,000 troops, although they had no way of paying such a large number. Unofficially, many youths were press-ganged and forced into service, by either the Armed Forces of DR Congo (FARDC) or by various armed militant groups throughout the country. Kabila's ADFL had drafted as many as 10,000 child soldiers during the First Congo War.

I Remember You (2017 film)

I Remember You () is a 2017 Icelandic mystery-horror film co-written and directed by Óskar Thór Axelsson. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Yrsa Sigurðardóttir.
Plot.
Freyr, a doctor in a city in Iceland, assists local police when an elderly woman is found hung inside of an old church. Crosses are found carved into her back, which is assumed to be the result of abuse, but when the dead woman's husband insists he never touched her, policewoman Dagny links the death to the mysterious disappearance of a young boy, Bernódus, who vanished decades earlier. Dagny shows him a photograph of Bernódus's classmates, with eight of their faces scratched out with crosses. She explains that the classmates were known for bullying Bernódus, who had crosses carved on his back from his ultra-religious, abusive father (who blamed him for the death of his wife in childbirth). Six of the eight have been killed in mysterious accidents and were all found with crosses carved into their backs. Freyr, who is still reeling from the unsolved disappearance of his own son, Benni, while Benni was playing hide-and-seek with a friend, begins to see visions of Bernódus.
In the second plotline, married couple Katrin and Garðar (recovering from a recent estrangement), along with Katrin's best friend Líf, move to a small, abandoned hamlet to renovate an old, decades-abandoned house to turn into a bed and breakfast. While exploring the area, Katrin stumbles upon an old cemetery, with one of the graves missing a headstone. She begins to experience paranormal incidents around the area, including seeing Bernódus's ghost near the creek along with the missing headstone and hearing strange sounds in the house, which cause her to fall down the stairs and sprain her foot. As the house gets no cell phone reception, the group is unable to call for help. Katrin also ventures into the house's cellar, where she finds the body of Bernódus, who is carrying a picture of his mother, who resembles Katrin. The group is shaken by the discovery, but are again unable to get into contact with others. Katrin refuses to stay in the house any longer, and they move to another unoccupied home nearby.
Freyr continues to experience his own strange incidents. Benni's autistic friend only reveals that Benni was last seen in a "green submarine." The seventh bully of Bernódus is found dead after an apparent suicide attempt, and Freyr finds dozens of newspaper clippings about Benni's disappearance in one of his rooms. Freyr also learns that the eighth bully was Úrsúla, a woman he knows who is suffering from schizophrenia. An addled Úrsúla tells him that Benni is "at the bottom" of "somewhere green," but Freyr is unable to get more out of her; a clairvoyant who claims to be in contact with Benni's ghost gives similar information. Meanwhile, Katrin learns that Garðar and Líf were having an affair during their estrangement, which leaves her feeling betrayed. However, Garðar and Líf are still in love, and while Katrin is away, they plan to run away together and abandon Katrin. As they discuss their feelings, they are attacked by what appears to be a young boy who throws a stone through their window before running away to a nearby whale house. Garðar and Líf give chase and encounter Bernódus's ghost inside. The chimney then collapses on top of both of them. Katrin discovers Garðar dead and Líf mortally wounded. Katrin runs to try to find cell phone reception to call for help using Líf's phone, but in doing so discovers that Líf was pregnant with Garðar's baby, and the two were planning to run away together. A devastated Katrin leaves without calling, and goes to sleep in the cellar with Bernódus's body.
Freyr awakens in the middle of the night and goes for a jog, where he once again sees Bernódus's ghost and gives chase. Bernódus leads him to a trapped Úrsúla, who claims that Bernódus is always with her; she reveals that she was the last one to see him before his disappearance, and saw him hiding in a boat, which she kept a secret for decades. Ursula also adds that Bernodus had been 'woken up' by the arrival of Benni's ghost to the house. Bernódus disembarked at the abandoned hamlet, which held the grave of his late mother, whose headstone Katrin discovered; alone, he wandered around the empty house before perishing in the cellar. Meanwhile, Benni's friend draws a green submarine, which his mother sends to Dagny. In a moment of inspiration, Dagny realizes that what he is describing is not a submarine, but a septic tank. She examines the gas station footage where Benni was last seen, and the footage reveals Katrin, Garðar and Líf; they were carrying a septic tank with them to renovate the house with. 
It is revealed that Katrin, Garðar and Líf's plotline took place years earlier. Garðar and Líf's bodies were discovered, but Katrin was never found. Dagny posits that Benni crawled inside the septic tank in the gas station while the three were inside having a meal and died. They make their way to the abandoned house, where Benni's body is found inside the septic tank. Devastated but finally having closure, Freyr sits inside the house. Something draws him to the cellar, where the bodies of Katrin and Bernódus lay, but he shuts its door without looking inside. He leaves with Benni's body (including his blue-jacketed ghost, implying that he's no longer stuck), as the ghosts of Katrin and Bernódus hold hands and sadly watch him go.
Reception.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 7 reviews, with an average rating of 6.25/10. The website incorrectly spells the title "Eg man big". Cath Clarke from "The Guardian" gave the film three out of five stars and wrote: "Maybe it’s a matter of personal taste, but for me, the spectre of a supernatural explanation felt like a plot cop-out. Or perhaps the movie simply lacks a truly shocking moment of horror. It’s entertaining enough, but certainly didn’t have me reaching for a jumper." Frank Scheck from "The Hollywood Reporter" said: "I Remember You certainly traffics in clichés, such as its central character of an emotionally tortured investigator dealing with tragic events in his past. But the horror elements are relatively fresh to the genre, with director Axelsson teasing them out in intriguingly subtle fashion until the ending in which the various plot strands are satisfyingly tied together." Noel Murray from "Los Angeles Times" wrote: "But while the horror elements certainly could have been more horrifying, "I Remember You" does have a strong sense of place and character. The genre's a little twisted, but the film should still appeal to fans of books about moody detectives, doggedly pursuing justice against a frosty backdrop." Andy Webster from "The New York Times", stated: "The Icelandic director Oskar Thor Axelsson is clearly fluent in horror conventions. But he has commendable restraint, and his latest film, “I Remember You,” transcends genre pyrotechnics even as it incorporates elements of Nordic noir."

Victory Park (Riga)

Victory Park (, ) is a park in Riga, located on the left bank of the Daugava, in the district of Āgenskalns.The modern area of the park is 36.7 hectares.
History.
When Latvia was in the Russian Empire, the park was known as Riga Petrovsky Park (, ). It was created in 1909 on the eve of a large-scale celebration of the bicentennial anniversary of the actual accession of the Governorate of Livonia to the Russian Empire. The official opening ceremony of the park complex took place in the middle of 1910 in the presence of Tsar Nicholas II, and the Mayor of Riga George Armitstead.
In 1923, the park was renamed Victory Park in honor of the victory in 1919 over the West Russian Volunteer Army under the command of Colonel Pavel Bermondt-Avalov during the Latvian War of Independence.
Before the Second World War, a reconstruction of the park was carried out, aimed at creating a new socially significant leisure center for the population of the Latvian capital. During the Soviet occupation, the Riga City Council decided to rename the park after the XXII Congress of the CPSU. In 1985, a monument in honor of the soldiers of the Soviet Army was opened. At this point, the Riga City Council renamed the park to Victory Park again.

Söderström (Stockholm)

Söderström is a river in central Stockholm that connects Lake Mälaren with the Baltic Sea. It runs south of Gamla stan from Riddarfjärden to Stockholms ström (the western part of Saltsjön). It is one of two natural waterways between Mälaren and the Baltic sea, the other being Norrström north of Gamla stan.
The river is locked by Karl Johansslussen (Karl Johan's lock), and most of the time is conceived as more like a bay of Mälaren. The area around the lock is known as the Slussenområdet, and beginning in 2016 is undergoing a major revitalization. The channel of an older lock, known as the Nils Ericson lock, still exists just to the north of Karl Johansslussen. This lock is hidden by the steps leading to Karl Johans Torg, but it still allows for the discharge of water from Mälaren into the Baltic. It is planned to convert the channel of this older lock into a fish ladder, as the revitalized area will include two much larger discharge channels on either side of the new lock.

Rochester Electronics

Rochester Electronics, LLC is a privately owned American technology company headquartered in Newburyport, MA, United States that manufactures and globally distributes semiconductors that are either obsolete or nearing the end of their product lifecycle. The company works under authorization from original semiconductor manufacturers to distribute and is licensed to manufacture obsolete semiconductors.
History.
Rochester Electronics was founded in 1981 by Curt Gerrish. Gerrish started his career at Motorola where he remained for two decades. It was at Motorola that he learned of the challenge major corporations and government agencies face when a semiconductor nears the end of its product lifecycle.
Gerrish found that a semiconductor's product lifecycle is much shorter than that of the product in which it is placed. Realizing there was a need for the distribution of end-of-life semiconductor products when no longer supported by the original manufacturer, he left his position at Motorola and started Rochester Electronics.
Present.
Rochester Electronics owns billions of silicon die which are stored in nitrogen-purged dry boxes, and billions more finished devices warehoused in temperature and humidity controlled facilities both in Newburyport, Massachusetts and in Portsmouth, NH, a free trade-zone area. In addition to distributing discontinued semiconductors, they assemble and test products as a semiconductor manufacturer licensed under the original manufacturer. They also have the ability to replicate parts that no longer have available silicon or design documents.
Semiconductor anti-counterfeit awareness.
Since semiconductors are engineered within an incalculable number of critical systems and products such as airplanes, trains, lifesaving health equipment, etc. a failure of one has the potential to pose considerable risk to the health and safety of people around the globe. There have been several documented incidents of counterfeit semiconductors causing and/or potentially causing serious health and safety issues. In 2006, Rochester Electronics initiated the formation of the Semiconductor Industry Association's [SIA] Anti-Counterfeiting Task Force (ACTF). They remain an active participant promoting best procurement practices and the importance of avoiding counterfeit and substandard semiconductors.

Mabel Isabel Wilcox

Mabel Isabel Wilcox (November 4, 1882 – December 28, 1978) was a pioneering nurse on the island of Kauai. She served with the Red Cross in Europe during World War I, and was decorated by Elisabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Belgium and by the Mayor of Le Havre. She was instrumental in instituting public nursing services on Kauai and in getting a hospital built on the island.
Family background.
She was born November 4, 1882, in the Kingdom of Hawaii, on the island of Kauai, as one of six children of Samuel Whitney Wilcox (1847–1929) and Emma Washburn Lyman Wilcox (1849–1934). Mabel's mother was a seminary student in Chicago in 1871 when the Great Chicago Fire occurred. Her father was a Kauai sugar planter, manager of a cattle ranch, and sheriff of Kauai for 25 years.
Maternal grandparents David Belden Lyman (1803–1884) and Sarah Joiner Lyman (1805–1885), and paternal grandparents Abner Wilcox (1808–1869) and Lucy Eliza Hart Wilcox (1814–1869), had been sent to Hawaii by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in Massachusetts. She was the niece of businessmen George Norton Wilcox and Albert Spencer Wilcox.
Her sisters and brothers were high-achieving individuals. Sister Lucy Etta Wilcox Sloggett (1877–1933) was a civic leader on Kauai, and also the World War I secretary of the Maui chapter of the American Red Cross. Sister Elsie Hart Wilcox (1879–1954) served as a senator in the Hawaii territorial legislature. Her older brother Ralph Lyman Wilcox (1876–1913) was a plantation overseer on Kauai; brother Charles Henry Wilcox (1880–1920) served in the Hawaii National Guard, managed sugar plantations, and had been a representative in the territorial legislature; brother Gaylord Parke Wilcox (1881–1970) was Chairman of the Board of Grove Farm, Ltd.
Education and early career.
She received her early education at home from a private instructor, transferring later to Punahou School on Oahu, followed by three years at Oakland High School in California, completing her basic education at the college preparatory Dana Hall School in Massachusetts.
Her parents discouraged her from a career in nursing, but she persisted in pursuing her profession at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, receiving her RN degree in 1911. According to Johns Hopkins, she was the first Hawaii resident to graduate from the school. Upon graduation, she remained in New York for several years, affiliated with the Buffalo Red Cross War Relief organization.
In 1915, she returned home to Kauai as an employee of the Territorial Board of Health. Instituting the island's first public nursing services, she was influential in raising funds and getting the territorial legislature to allocate land to build the Samuel Mahelona Memorial Hospital at Kapaa.
World War I.
With the outbreak of World War I, Johns Hopkins pediatrician Edwards A. Park, working with the American Red Cross Belgian Commission, headed the Children's Hospital in Le Havre as a facility for refugee Belgian children. He appointed Mabel as head nurse in supervision over 15 other nurses, among whom was Ethel Moseley Damon of Honolulu. They provided medical care and a safe haven for the children, often putting themselves in harm's way behind enemy lines to assist refugee women. In recognition of their war-time services, Mabel and Ethel were decorated with the Queen Elisabeth Medal by the Queen Elisabeth of Belgium and the Bronze Medal of the City of Le Havre by the Mayor of Le Havre.
Postwar career.
Returning home to Kauai, she became the trustee and treasurer of Samuel Mahelona Memorial Hospital, and a probation officer of the Kauai County Juvenile Court. In the ensuing decades, she served in administrative and advisory capacities of numerous boards and institutions. Mabel and her sisters renovated the Wai‘oli Mission House, which had been the boyhood home of their father. The house is now part of the Waioli Mission District on Kauai.
She died at home on December 28, 1978, and is buried on the island of Kauai.

2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships – Women's shot put

The women's shot put at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships took place on 2 March 2018.
Summary.
No qualifying round was needed, so all entrants were finalists. In the first round Danniel Thomas-Dodd took the lead with an 18.92m. Paulina Guba and Gao Yang held the next two positions. Thomas-Dodd improved slightly in the second round but was displaced by the next thrower, Gong Lijiao with an 18.98m. Gao also improved with her best of the day 18.77m. In a vulnerable fifth position after two rounds, Anita Márton saw no challenge to remaining in the competition, then let loose a 19.48m to leapfrog into the lead. Thomas-Dodd wasn't able to answer that, but as the next to step into the ring, she did throw her best of the day 19.22m, good enough to improve her own Jamaican national record and her hold on silver. In the final round, Gong threw a 19.08m to solidify her bronze medal position, almost matched by Thomas-Dodd's final effort of 19.07m, but with gold in hand and the pressure off again, Márton threw a new Hungarian national record to cap off her day.
Márton's gold medal was the first for Hungary in the World Championships. Thomas-Dodd's was the first medal for a Jamaican woman in the shot put.
Results.
The final was started at 20:09.

Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature

The Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature (EDGES) is an experiment and radio telescope located in a radio quiet zone at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory in Western Australia. It is a collaboration between Arizona State University and Haystack Observatory, with infrastructure provided by CSIRO. EoR stands for epoch of reionization, a time in cosmic history when neutral atomic hydrogen gas became ionised due to ultraviolet light from the first stars.
Low-band instruments.
The experiment has two low-band instruments, each of which has a dipole antenna pointed to the zenith and observing a single polarisation. The antenna is around in size, sat on a ground shield. It is coupled with a radio receiver, with a 100m cable run to a digital spectrometer. The instruments operate at , and are separated by 150m. Observations started in August 2015.
78 MHz absorption profile.
In March 2018 the collaboration published a paper in "Nature" announcing the discovery of a broad absorption profile centered at a frequency of formula_1MHz in the sky-averaged signal after subtracting Galactic synchrotron emission. The absorption profile has a width of formula_2MHz and an amplitude of formula_3K, against a background RMS of 0.025K, giving it a signal-to-noise ratio of 37. The equivalent redshift is centered at formula_4, spanning z=20–15. The signal is possibly due to ultraviolet light from the first stars in the Universe altering the emission of the 21cm line by lowering the temperature of the hydrogen relative to the cosmic microwave background (the mechanism is Wouthuysen–Field coupling). A "more exotic scenario," encouraged by the unexpected strength of the absorption, is that the signal is due to interactions between dark matter and baryons.
High-band instruments.
The high-band instrument is of similar design, and operates at .

Mohnenfluh

The Mohnenfluh is a 2,544-metre-high mountain in the Austrian state of Vorarlberg.
The Mohnenfluh is the second-highest summit in the region of Schröcken after the Braunarlspitze, and is in the Lechquellen Mountains. An ascent is usually made via the Mohnen Saddle (2,315 m) and the south arête.
The Bregenzer Ach rises on the eastern flank of the Mohnenfluh above Schröcken at a height of about 2,400 metres.
The name "Mohn(-en)" may be connected to the word "Mond" ("moon"). Because there are also mountain meadows or "Bergmähder" nearby, it may be derived from "Mahd" / "Mähen" ("meadow").

Dally Ribbon Roping

Dally Ribbon Roping, also known as ribbon roping, is a team rodeo event that features a steer and one mounted riders and one contestant on foot. It is a timed event. The roper starts in the box and the runner must start from a designated spot determined by the field judge. Some rules allow a runner to start anywhere in the arena.
The event begins when the steer breaks the barrier. The roper must rope the steer. Any type of catch is legal. The roper must then "dally" which is to make several loops around the saddle horn with the rope. The runner must then grab the ribbon off the calf's tail. The runner then races back to the box, and the time is stopped once the runner crosses the barrier. Many organizations, like the National Little Britches Rodeo Association allow coed teams.

Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone

The Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone is a high-tech manufacturing area in Bayan Lepas, near the southeastern tip of Penang Island in Penang, Malaysia. Created in 1972, the area is Malaysia's first free-trade zone and was instrumental in alleviating an economic crisis in Penang. The zone is now home to various multinational firms, including Bosch, Motorola, Dell, Intel and Hewlett-Packard, and has been regarded as the "Silicon Valley of the East".
History.
The Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone was the brainchild of Lim Chong Eu, who served as the Chief Minister of Penang between 1969 and 1990, as a measure to alleviate Penang's economic downturn at the time. George Town, Penang's capital city, had its free port status revoked by the Malaysian federal government in 1969, leading to massive unemployment which peaked at 16.4%. Lim identified the electronics sector as having the best potential to absorb the state's excess semi-skilled workforce.
Nearly of land adjacent to the Penang International Airport were acquired for the construction of Malaysia's first free trade zone, as well as the adjacent township of Bayan Baru. The Penang Development Corporation (PDC) was tasked with the construction of both the zone and the residential township. To attract Multinational corporations to the zone, the Free Trade Zones Act was enacted by the Malaysian federal government in 1971 and pioneer tax incentives were offered.
The first phase of the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone, covering an area between the airport, Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah and the Kluang River, was opened in 1972. The zone has since been expanded and developed in phases. Phase 2 encompasses an area between Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah, Bukit Gedung and the Snake Temple. Phase 3 was partially built on reclaimed land, while Phase 4, the largest and final phase, was completed by the 1990s.
The Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone proved successful in attracting multinational firms and its creation played a vital role in reversing Penang's economic crisis. Intel, AMD, Hewlett-Packard, Clarion, National Semiconductor, Hitachi, Osram, and Bosch—collectively known as the "Samurai Eight"—were the first multinational companies to set up factories within the zone, followed by several other firms including Motorola and Dell. These firms are also supported by smaller, local-owned enterprises and startups, such as Piktochart. Consequently, the manufacturing sector became one of Penang's largest economic sectors, while the zone itself has been described by the international press as the "Silicon Valley of the East".
Tenants.
The following is an incomplete list of multinational firms within the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone.

Russian Overture, Op. 72, () is an overture composed in 1936 by Sergei Prokofiev. 
In 1936 Prokofiev returned permanently to the USSR. He showed sketches of the overture to Eugen Szenkar, who accepted it for his orchestra. Prokofiev used a large orchestra, as he had previously in the "Scythian Suite" and "Seven, They are Seven". The overture was completed on 25 September 1936 and premiered on 29 October in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory by Moscow State Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Szenkar, who subsequently performed it in Paris and elsewhere in Europe. After the premiere, Prokofiev reorchestrated the piece on the advice of Szenkar, reducing the number of brass, woodwind and percussion players. On 15 October 1937, it was given its American premiere by the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Serge Koussevitzky. According to Prokofiev's biographer, Simon Morrison, the overture "includes motives derived from Russian folkdance, salon song and liturgical chant."

DeLancey Astor Kane

DeLancey Astor Kane (August 28, 1844 – April 4, 1915) was an American soldier and horseman who was prominent in New York Society during the Gilded Age. He was called the "father of coaching in the United States."
Early life.
Kane was born on August 28, 1844, in Newport, Rhode Island. He was the second of eight children born to Oliver DeLancey Kane (1816–1874) and Louisa Dorothea (née Langdon) Kane (1821–1894). His brothers were Walter Langdon, John Innes Kane, Woodbury Kane, S. Nicholson Kane. His sisters were Louisa Langdon Kane, Emily Astor Kane (who married Augustus Jay and was the mother of Peter Augustus Jay), and Sybil Kent Kane.
Kane was a grandson of Walter Langdon and Dorothea (née Astor) Langdon of the Astor family and a great-grandson of John Jacob Astor. He was a cousin of Colonel John Jacob Astor IV. His paternal lineage descended from John O'Kane who emigrated to the country in 1752 from County Londonderry and Antrim, Ireland. During the American Revolutionary War, O'Kane (who dropped the "'O" once in America) was living at Sharyvogne, his estate in Dutchess County, which was confiscated after the War due to his Loyalist ties. His eldest son, John Jr., stayed and became one of the most prominent merchants in New York.
The family lived fashionably in lower Broadway. Their summer cottage, Beach Cliffe, designed by Detlef Lienau, was one of the earliest Newport houses "to attain a sort of Beaux-Arts purity." Kane graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1868. Following his service in the U.S. Army, he studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, in England and in 1873, graduated from Columbia Law School.
Career.
Kane, who inherited $10,000,000 from his mother's family, was a lieutenant in the First Cavalry, U.S.A. from 1868 to 1870, when he retired as a colonel, a title by which he was known for most of his life.
In 1876, Kane founded, with Col. William Jay, The Coaching Club of New York devoted to the coaching of horses which he picked up after his time spent in England. His stagecoach, "Tally-ho" was the first private stagecoach for pleasure riding in the United States.
Society life.
In 1892, both Kane and his wife Eleanora were included in Ward McAllister's "Four Hundred", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in "The New York Times". Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom.
He was a member of the Union Club, Metropolitan Club, the Knickerbocker Club, Country Club, the Coaching Club, the New York Yacht Club and the Larchmont Yacht Clubs.
His wife's father built them a county estate, known as "The Paddocks" in Davenport Neck, New Rochelle. The estate had a panoramic view of the Long Island Sound and Fort Slocum.
Personal life.
In 1872, Kane was married to Eleanora Iselin (1849–1938), the daughter of Adrian Georg Iselin, a prominent New York merchant and banker. Eleanora was also the sister of Adrian Jr., Columbus and Charles Iselin. In 1901, Kane and his wife purchased the former home of Arthur Astor Carey in Newport for $100,000 where he became a permanent resident. Together, they were the parents of one child:
Kane died of pneumonia on April 4, 1915, at the Kane estate in Davenport Neck in New Rochelle, New York.

Helen Appleton Read

Helen Lincoln Appleton Read (August 25, 1887 – December 3, 1974) was an American art critic and art historian.
Helen Lincoln Appleton was born on August 25, 1887 in Brooklyn Heights to R. Ross Appleton and his wife. Her father was a banker, who, by 1914, was President of the Security Bank of New York; She had a sister, Mary E. Appleton. Both sisters ultimately worked in the art world and became known as "the Appleton Girls".
Helen attended Brooklyn Heights Seminary, then Smith College from 1904 to 1908, majoring in art history. From 1908-14, she studied painting at the Art Students League under the supervision of William Merritt Chase and Frank Vincent DuMond and at the New York School of Art with painter Robert Henri. While studying art, she also sat for paintings, including two works by Eugene Speicher, "Red, White and Blue" (1914) and "Miss Helen Appleton" which won the 1911 Proctor Prize from the National Academy.
In 1914, she married Charles Albert Read III, son of Charles Albert Read Jr. and Ellen Arvilla (Hatfield) Read from Boston and Manchester-by-the-Sea. The couple had daughter, Helen Read, the following year, by then residing at 38 Livingston Street in Brooklyn. Charles and Helen Appleton Read eventually divorced, and as of 1967, Helen Appleton Read lived with Mary in their childhood home in Brooklyn Heights. Like Helen, Mary had a career in the arts, working at the Whitney Museum from its founding.
Following the birth of her daughter, Helen Appleton Read returned to art history and criticism, including authoring a book on her former painting teacher Robert Henri (1931). From 1922 to 1938, Appleton Read worked as art critic for "The Brooklyn Eagle"; for part of that period (1925 to 1930) she also served as associate art editor of "Vogue". She joined the contemporary portraiture gallery, Portraits, Inc., then located at 460 Park Avenue, in 1943 as gallery director, then became president in 1957. She retired in 1972, but continued as a consultant.
Appleton Read died on December 3, 1974, aged 87, at her Brooklyn Heights home at 146 Hicks Street, a historic Federal townhouse built in 1826. She was survived by her daughter, three granddaughters, and her sister.

Aviamotornaya (Bolshaya Koltsevaya line)

Aviamotornaya () is a station on the Bolshaya Koltsevaya line of the Moscow Metro. The station was opened on 27 March 2020 as part of Nekrasovskaya line extension.
Similar to Aviamotornaya on the Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya line, that station's name comes from Aviamotornaya Ulitsa, which, in turn, is named for the Baranov Central Institute of Aviation Motor Development.
Construction.
In July 2016, the Lefortovo market was cleared in order to begin construction on the station. Construction on the north lobby began in February 2017. Tunneling began in September 2017 starting with the left tunnel, followed by the right tunnel in October of that year.
Layout.
The station has two lobbies, one that exits to Aviamotornaya Ulitsa with a second at Proyezd Entuziastov. It is part of a transit hub that allows transfers to the existing Aviamotornaya station as well as the Novaya stop on the Kazanskoye branch of the Moscow Railway. In addition, there is a commercial component for vendors that previously had space in the now-demolished market.

Gregor Luthe

Gregor Luthe (born 19 October 1970) is a German chemist, toxicologist, nanotechnologist, inventor and entrepreneur. He is known for his work on toxicology of PCBs and PBDEs.
Early life.
Luthe was born in Epe on 19 October 1970, the only child of bricklayer and stove fitter Ewald Luthe and spinning mill worker Käthe Luthe, née Böcker. Luthe had a hard start at school as he stammered until 9th grade, when he learned to manage this, and leaped forward, leaving the lower education Hauptschule to enter the Gymnasium in Bardel, finishing it 1989 as best in class.
At the age of 19, he traveled to visit the GDR two weeks before the Fall of the Berlin Wall. Luthe was held for STASI questioning on 9 November 1989. He learned about this day's events only on the day of his release, the following morning.
Career.
Gregor Luthe studied chemistry, biology and physics at the University of Münster (1990 to 1995), where he specialized on fluorinated analogs of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds and graduated with the diploma. In 2002 he obtained his doctorate at the VU University Amsterdam (Netherlands). Starting 1996 he worked as a lecturer at the Saxion University of Applied Sciences in Enschede (Netherlands). As Marie Curie fellow of the European Council Luthe went to Trondheim (Norway) 2002 to 2005, where he was a senior researcher at the NTNU, and also worked as the technical director and associate of the company "Chiron". 2005 he was awarded with the Feodor Lynen research scholarship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation to study toxicology in Berkeley at the University of Iowa (USA), where he still is visiting professor and supervises doctorate students of the interdisciplinary graduate program in human toxicology. Luthe started investigating in e.g. the toxicology of PCBs and PBDEs. After some months as a lecturer at the University of Hawaii at Hilo he returned to Europe, to be a lecturer at the Saxion University of Applied Sciences in Enschede (Netherlands). 2007 to 2008 Luthe was additionally lecturer at the Jacobs University Bremen. In 2010 Gregor Luthe founded the company "Windplussonne GmbH".
In February 2012 Gregor Luthe was appointed Professor of Nanotechnology ("NanoBioInterface") at Saxion in Enschede, which was the first Nanotechnology lectureship in the Netherlands. The chair focuses on the development and application of NanoBio interface production techniques which are essential for medical, biological, toxicological and chemical applications, e. g. Lab-on-a-Chip devices. Luthe also engaged in multiple regional and international research partnerships and events, e.g. in January 2014 by establishing the "Euregional Conference of Applied Nanotechnology" (ECAN 2014) in Enschede, partnered by "Alumni Nanotechnology Saxion" (A.N.S), Saxion University of Applied Sciences, the MESA+ Institute for Nanotechnology (University of Twente) and CeNTech (University of Münster). In September 2014 Gregor Luthe was co-initiating the cooperation of the University of Twente and Saxion University of Applied Sciences, to promote joint research in the field of Nanotechnology and to start the Netherlands' first Master's degree program in nanotechnology. In 2014 Gregor Luthe founded the company "Smart Material Printing" with former students, to work on the production of new materials for 3D printing technologies as well as antibacterial surfaces. He also co-founded the company "Nanobay – NB GmbH". Gregor Luthe left his chair in Nanotechnology at Saxion in February 2015 to focus on his company activities. Luthe continues to engage in research projects and scientific work.

You Kiddin' Me

You Kiddin' Me is an American hidden camera practical joke reality show series that premiered on September 22, 2018, on Facebook Watch.
Premise.
"You Kiddin' Me" is described as "a comedic prank series where kids are in charge and celebrities must do everything their own children say. The series peeks into the family relationships of Hollywood stars as children prank their famous parents and an unsuspecting public."
Production.
On March 2, 2018, it was announced that Facebook had given the production a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes. Executive producers are set to include Kim Kardashian, Jennifer O'Connell, Brian Tannenbaum, Peter M. Cohen, and Melissa Stokes. Production companies involved in the series are slated to consist of Lionsgate Television. On September 7, 2018, it was announced that the series would premiere on September 22, 2018.
Reception.
In a negative review, "The Ringer"s Kate Knibbs criticized the series saying, "Every era gets the "Punk'd" it deserves, and we are living through a spectacularly dumb and cruel moment. There’s something fitting about how Facebook, notorious for flooding the internet with viral garbage, debuted an accidental, weirdly cruel anti-comedy in its push for original content. "You Kiddin’ Me?!" isn't funny."

Sacred Lies

Sacred Lies is an American drama streaming television series based on the novel "The Sacred Lies of Minnow Bly" by Stephanie Oakes that premiered on July 27, 2018 on Facebook Watch. The series was created by Raelle Tucker and stars Elena Kampouris, Kevin Carroll, Kiana Madeira, Toby Huss, and Ryan Robbins. Its second season premiered on February 20, 2020 under the title "Sacred Lies: The Singing Bones". On June 15, 2020, the first two seasons were acquired by Peacock.
Premise.
"Sacred Lies" (Season 1) follows "a handless teen who escapes from a cult and finds herself in juvenile detention, suspected of knowing who killed her cult leader."
Production.
Background.
Series creator Raelle Tucker has expressed how she was initially drawn into developing the series due to her own childhood experiences growing up in a cult. During the 1970s, Tucker and her family were members of the Rajneesh movement and years later these events would inspire her to want to work on a project involving the subject of cults.
Development.
On January 16, 2018, it was announced that Facebook had given the production, a television series adaptation of Stephanie Oakes's novel "The Sacred Lies of Minnow Bly", a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes. The series was set to be written by Raelle Tucker who would also executive produce alongside Scott Winant, Jason Blum, Marci Wiseman, and Jeremy Gold. Tucker was also set to act as the series' showrunner while Winant would direct the first two episodes. Production companies involved in the series were slated to include Blumhouse Television, a subsidiary of independent film company Blumhouse Productions. On June 23, 2018, it was announced that the series would premiere on July 27, 2018. On December 13, 2018, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a second season which premiered on February 20, 2020 under the title "Sacred Lies: The Singing Bones".
Series writer Molly Nussbaum has expressed the difficulty involved in the series' writing due to the time constraints imposed by Facebook. She explained how instead of viewing the limitation as an obstacle the staff saw it as a creative opportunity saying, "the 30-minute challenge really made us rigorous and smart."
Casting.
On March 2, 2018, it was announced that Elena Kampouris, Kevin Carroll, Kiana Madeira, and Ryan Robbins had been cast in main roles. A month later, it was announced that Toby Huss had joined the main cast in a series regular role and that Katrina Law and Leah Gibson would appear in a recurring capacity.
Filming.
Principal photography for season one began on March 15, 2018 in Vancouver, Canada and was set to last until May 25, 2018. Filming for the second season began on July 3, 2019 and ended on September 13, 2019.
Release.
Marketing.
On June 23, 2018, a teaser trailer for the series was released. On July 16, 2018, the full trailer for the series was released. From July 19 to July 22, 2018, during the 2018 San Diego Comic-Con, the series was promoted through an escape room experience outside of Petco Park.
Premiere.
On June 24, 2018, the series held a screening at Seriesfest, an annual international television festival, at the Sie FilmCenter in Denver, Colorado. The screening was followed by a question-and-answer session with creator/executive producer Raelle Tucker, director/executive producer Scott Winant, Blumhouse co-president of television Jeremy Gold, and cast members including Kiana Madeira, Kevin Carroll, and Elena Kampouris. It was moderated by Facebook Watch's head of development, Mina Lefevre.
Reception.
In a positive review, "Variety"s Caroline Framke offered the series praise saying, "With episodes running at an economical half-hour, "Sacred Lies" maintains a solid enough balance between withholding answers and laying groundwork for the mysteries ahead." In a similarly favorable critique, "Paste"s Alexis Gunderson lauded the series saying, "It is very artistic, not just in the color saturation, but in every shot of hands, fingers, and things that need hands and fingers to cross Minnow's line of sight in the detention center—shots that would feel fetishizing were it not for the absolute opacity of thought with which the shrewd Minnow, who is never presented as an object of pity, regards them. It is absolutely artistic. It is also grim. It is also an active, challenging watch. It is, as far as I can tell, all the things everyone's favorite dark prestige television is." In a more mixed assessment, "The Globe and Mail"s John Doyle offered the series restrained approval saying, ""Sacred Lies" is a good, multilayered drama, although the vaguely supernatural quality to Minnow's past is milked a bit too hard." In an overall negative review, "Indiewire"s Ben Travers gave the series a grade of "C-" and criticized it saying, "This half-hour drama is ineffective in teasing its larger mystery, and its dialogue can be laughably blunt. Die-hard fans of the book may stick around to see how it all plays out, but that would take a level of commitment usually seen...in cults!"

Coping planning

Coping planning is an approach to supporting people who are distressed. It is part of a biopsychosocial approach to mental health and wellbeing that comprises healthy environments, responsive parenting, belonging, healthy activities, coping, psychological resilience and treatment of illness. Coping planning normalises distress as a universal human experience. It draws on a health-focused approach to coping, to improve emotion regulation and decrease the memory of unpleasant emotions. Coping planning interventions are effective when people are supported in the process of forming coping plans.
Approach.
Coping planning aims to meet the needs of people who ask for help with distress, including suicidal ideation. By addressing "why" someone asks for help, the focus stays on what the person needs rather than on what the helper wants to do. It provides an alternative to the widely used, but non-evidence-based risk-assessment approach to suicide prevention. Needs assessment and support focuses on the individual needs of each person. They are rated as low (coping independently), moderate (may need additional low-intensity professional support), or high (needs immediate high-intensity professional support).
Applications.
In addition to suicide prevention training for health professionals, coping planning has been used to train journalists, and to help a range of people cope better, including carers, university students, and with children to improve emotional regulation.
In suicide prevention.
Coping planning is designed to contribute to suicide prevention in a number of ways. Firstly, it provides a framework to support people whenever they seek help, rather than waiting until they are considered high-risk for death by suicide. Secondly, it aims to focus on helping people to cope, rather than to stay safe from suicide, which, according to ironic process theory, makes it more likely that people will think about suicide. Healthy coping strategies improve overall wellbeing and reduce distress. The approach is designed for use in both low (e.g., psychological first aiders or telephone helplines) and high intensity services (e.g., emergency departments or inpatient care units).

First Universalist Church (Atlanta)

The First Universalist Church of Atlanta, organized in 1895, re-established a Universalist presence in Atlanta, Georgia. Initial missionary efforts in 1879 were short-lived and failed to establish a permanent presence in the city. With the explicit assistance the Young People's Christian Union, this second missionary effort enabled the Universalists to sustain their presence and construct a church building on East Harris in 1900. The Universalists occupied the church until 1918 when they merged with Atlanta's Unitarians.
The combined churches selected the Unitarian church on West Peachtree Street as their collective home. The combined church known by several names over the next three decades collapsed in 1951.
History.
Universalist Churches in Georgia.
At the start of 1879, the Universalists in Georgia had a statewide rural presence of 10 churches with a total membership of 236. In the summer of that same year, Rev. William Clayton Bowman attempted to establish an urban Universalist presence in Atlanta.
Born in 1833 in the mountain region of North Carolina, W.C. Bowman had limited access to both formal education and regular religious services. His exposure to religion came from itinerant Methodist, Baptist and Dunker preachers and revival exaltations to go to the 'mourner's bench' and 'seek religion.' Bowman, however, found more doubt than religion. He rejected the doctrine of endless punishment. "I still held to the Bible as the infallible word of God, but it was redeemed in my mind from the horrible meanings given to it by orthodoxy." Bowman self-converted to universalism. 
First Missionary Effort in Atlanta.
In July 1879, Bowman held several Universalist services in the Hall of Representatives in the Georgia Capitol Building in Atlanta. Later services were regularly held at the Georgia Academy of Science on Mitchell Street. In October 1880, he was re-elected pastor of the city’s Universalist church. Also in 1880, his Atlanta church was listed in the inventory of Georgia's Universalist churches showing a membership of 11 families.
Rev. D.B. Clayton, a South Carolina itinerant Universalist minister, moved to Atlanta in 1890 to assist Bowman and publish the newly founded "Atlanta Universalist" newspaper. 
By early 1881, the same doubt that drew Bowman from orthodox religion to Universalism drew him to the spiritualism. Bowman severed his connection with the Universalist church and began leading services at the Liberal and Spiritual Church. Bowman continued his connection with the Liberal and Spiritual Church until July 1883 when he left Atlanta for Cincinnati. 
Following Bowman’s departure from the nascent Universalist church, Rev. Clayton sporadically held Sunday services until the summer of 1882, after which the Universalist activities in Atlanta ceased.
Just as the Universalist missionary effort was ending in Atlanta, the Unitarians were starting their efforts to establish a church in Atlanta. By March 1883, the Unitarians had organized the Church of Our Father. This liberal church provided former members of Bowman's Universalist church a temporary home until the Universalists could resume their own missionary work in the city.
Second Missionary Effort in Atlanta.
In October 1893, Universalist missionary work resumed in Atlanta with an announcement in the local paper stating that "Rev. Q.H. Shinn, the National Evangelist of the Universalist Church will visit the city for ten days. The Unitarians offered Rev. Shinn use of their church to hold services." 
Rev. Quillen Hamilton Shinn was born in 1845 and fellowshipped in the Vermont Convention. In his early career, he preached on a circuit that included Canada and Nebraska as well as holding the pastorate in several New England churches. In 1891 he committed himself exclusively to itinerant missionary work. More significantly for the resumption of missionary work in Atlanta, in 1893 the Universalist’s Young People's Christian Union (Y.P.C.U.) elected Rev. Shinn to be their national organizer.
The Young People's Christian Union was organized in 1889 and adopted missionary work as its main focus. 
In February 1895, in order to raise a Universalist congregation, Rev. Shinn and Rev. D.B. Clayton joined Rev. McGlauflin, the Y.P.C.U. Southern Missionary, to conduct a series of revival meetings in Atlanta. The announcement in the local papers of the weeklong revival revealed the difficulties the Universalist’s message of universal salvation faced in a community holding orthodox religious views on sin and eternal damnation. The February 15 headline in "The Atlanta Constitution" read, "It’s Not Infidelity. Rev. Q.H. Shinn, Universalist, Defends His Church and Creed." 
The Universalists were undeterred. The November 1895 issue of "Onward", the Y.P.C.U. magazine, a front-page article declared, "On to Atlanta! The ground is broken at Atlanta, Ga. The die is cast. The Rubicon crossed. We have put our hand to the plough, there is no turning back now." The Universalists continued their missionary efforts. In April 1896, Rev. McGlauflin resigned his pastorate at the Grace Universalist Church in Harriman, Tennessee, an earlier Y.P.C.U. missionary project. He moved to Atlanta, relocated the headquarters of the Y.P.C.U. Southern Missionary to that city and assumed the pastorate of the Universalist church. By 1900, membership in the church had risen to just over 100 and sufficient funds had been collected to build a church at 16 East Harris Street. The church was dedicated on July 15, 1900. 
Christianity Questioned.
Shortly after the dedication of the new church building, the Christian bona fides of Atlanta's Universalists (and Unitarians) was challenged by religious fervor born in the dawn of a new century from Christians in Great Britain. 
To usher in the twentieth century, the Federation of Free Churches in Great Britain embraced the idea of a religious revival called the National Simultaneous Mission. The idea caught the imagination of Christians in the United States who envisioned a coast-to-coast, simultaneous revival "born in prayer and the preaching of the old-fashioned Gospel and carried forward in trusting dependence on the Holy Spirit." A Central Committee of Christian leaders was formed in New York. On February 8, 1903, the New York Central Committee called for a nationwide Gospel Campaign.
Atlanta's Christian ministers responded enthusiastically. On February 27, Atlanta pastors from all denominations, including Rev. McGlauflin from the Universalist Church and Rev. Langston from the Unitarian church, gathered to coordinate activities. The next day, "The Atlanta Constitution" carried an article with the headline, "Plans Complete for Religious Revival" stating that two prominent Universalists, Rev. F.A. Bisbee and Rev. A.A. Ross, would participate. 
Two days later, strong opposition was voiced regarding the participation of Universalists and Unitarians. Rev. G. Campbell Morgan, a prominent British-born evangelical who had recently moved to Massachusetts, shocked an audience of 2,200 people in an impassioned speech stating, "I can not and will not enter into any alliance with men whose creed denies the essential elements of salvation." 
Rev. Len G. Broughton, the fundamentalist minister of Atlanta’s Baptist Tabernacle, added his voice to the opposition. Although there were ministers who supported the Universalists and Unitarians, in the end, both denominations were excluded from the gospel campaign. 
On the same day as the official opening of the gospel campaign, Rev. McGlauflin preached at his church, "When St. Paul was once thrown into prison those responsible for the act regretted it afterward and sent him word that it would be agreeable if he would quietly leave by a side door which they would leave open for him. He said, ‘No.’ If they wish me to leave let them come and openly set me free. I shall follow the apostolic example." 
Merger with Unitarians and Collapse.
In February 1918 the Universalists elected to merge with Atlanta’s Unitarians. The merger was announced in a February 23, 1918 article in "The Atlanta Constitution". "The Unitarian and Universalists of Atlanta will meet in public worship at the Unitarian Church, 301 West Peachtree street, tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock. This is the first meeting under a temporary merger of the two congregations which is planned to last for the duration of the war. Rev. T.B. Fisher, the retiring minister of the Universalist church, will preach on 'The Larger Destiny.' All friends are cordially invited."
The merger of the two denominations, however, continued long after the conclusion of the war in November 1918.
Once combined, the Unitarians and Universalists renamed their joint church the Liberal Christian Church. The Universalist church building on East Harris Street was sold in April 1920 for $20,000 and the proceeds were set aside to assist the newly federated congregation.
The merger continued until 1951 when the combined church was engulfed in controversy regarding accusations of communist sympathizing and racial segregation. The national organizations for both the Universalist Church of America and the American Unitarian Association withdrew support for the federated church. The American Unitarian Association, which held the property deed, sold the building in 1951. The church officially disbanded.
Renewed Efforts in Atlanta.
Following the sale of the church building and the disbanding of the original congregation, the Universalist Church of America and the American Unitarian Association coordinated efforts to raise a new liberal church in Atlanta. Rev. Glenn O. Canfield was dispatched to the city in early 1952. He successfully regrouped several former members and attracted new members and re-chartered the United Liberal Church. In 1966, the church changed its name to the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Atlanta (UUCA).

Trail course

Trail Course is a rodeo event in which a horse and rider attempt to complete a series of obstacles in the fastest time. It combines the horse's athletic ability and the horsemanship skills of a rider in order to safely and successfully maneuver a horse through a series of five obstacles. The rider must remain mounted the entire time. It is similar to Trail competition at horse shows, but with emphasis on speed rather than style.
Modern event.
Today the trail course is mostly a youth rodeo event. The National Little Britches Rodeo has both a senior girl trail course competition and a junior girl trail course competition. The only difference is the jump is removed from the junior girls' event. Some college rodeo programs also compete in the trail course.
Obstacles.
There are five obstacles that must be navigated. The obstacles can be placed in any order, and are usually rearranged between rounds. The obstacles are:
The course covers about 100 yards in total distance.
Rules.
The rider must remain on the horse the entire time. The rider must complete the course in the laid out order and may not skip an obstacle. The rider must carry the 3 X 5 "mail" card with her until she places it in the mailbox.
10 second penalties will be assessed for the following:

S. Nicholson Kane

Samuel Nicholson Kane (July 2, 1846 – November 15, 1906) was an American soldier and sailor prominent in New York Society during the Gilded Age who served as the Commodore of New York Yacht Club.
Early life.
Kane was born on July 2, 1846 in New York City. He was one of eight children born to Oliver DeLancey Kane (1816–1874) and Louisa Dorothea (née Langdon) Kane (1821–1894). His brothers were Walter Langdon Kane, DeLancey Astor Kane, John Innes Kane, Woodbury Kane. His sisters were Louisa Langdon Kane, Emily Astor Kane (who married Augustus Jay and was the mother of Peter Augustus Jay), and Sybil Kent Kane.
He was the grandson of Walter Langdon and Dorothea (née Astor) Langdon and the great-grandson of John Jacob Astor. He was a cousin of Lt. Col. John Jacob Astor IV. His paternal lineage descended from John O'Kane who emigrated to the country in 1752 from County Londonderry and Antrim, Ireland. During the American Revolutionary War, O'Kane (who dropped the "'O" once in America) was living at Sharyvogne, his estate in Dutchess County, which was confiscated after the War due to his Loyalist times. His eldest son, John Jr., stayed and became one of the most prominent merchants in New York.
The family lived at "Beach Cliffe", designed by Detlef Lienau, which was one of the earliest Newport cottages "to attain a sort of Beaux-Arts purity." After prep school in New York, Kane attended and graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1866. After his service in the Navy, he entered Cambridge University in England where he graduated in 1873. After returning the United States, he studied law at Albany Law School.
Career.
After the Naval Academy, Kane was assigned the grade of ensign and began working on the staff of Admiral David Farragut. He resigned from the U.S. Navy in 1868. After the Navy, he attended university in England then returned to the United States for law school, and was admitted to the bar. Even though he was admitted, due to his "ample means", he did not practice his profession.
In 1874, he became a member of the New York Yacht Club, where he served as Commodore and an officer for many years. During the beginning of the Spanish–American War, he volunteered as an Ensign and in ten days, was promoted to Senior Lieutenant, serving on the staff of Admiral Charles Dwight Sigsbee, serving until the end of the war. Kane was honorably discharged on November 15, 1898.
Society life.
In 1892, Kane, along with two of his brothers and their wives, were included in Ward McAllister's "Four Hundred", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in "The New York Times". Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom.
He was a member of the Union Club, Metropolitan Club, the Knickerbocker Club, the New York Yacht Club, and the American Geographical Society.
Personal life.
Kane lived at the Kane family mansion at 23 West 47th Street in Manhattan. In 1889, he was described as:
"He is an enthusiastic yachtsman, and is an excellent whip. He has traveled much, is a discriminating collector of books, and is exceptionally well-like, being very affable and a "raconteur" of unusual eloquence."
Kane, who suffered from cirrhosis hepatitis, died of intestinal hemorrhages in a sleeping car in Manassas, Virginia about thirty miles from Washington, DC on November 15, 1906. He had been in Hot Springs for three weeks seeking treatment. He was buried at Island Cemetery in Newport, Rhode Island.

<doc id="56733788" url="?curid=56733788" title="Wei Yijie">
Wei Yijie

Wei Yijie (Chinese: 魏裔介; August 19, 1616 – April 27, 1686) was a prominent Han Chinese scholar and official serving in the early Qing Dynasty, during the rules of the Shunzhi Emperor, Oboi, and the Kangxi Emperor and was known for his focus and advocacy of the reformation the Examination system.
Early career.
Wei Yijie was from Baixiang, in western Zhili. He passed the 1646 "Jinshi" examination and gained a reputation for his focus on the examination system. Wei served in his first administrative position in 1648 when he was the placed as the principal examiner for the Shanxi province. In the same year, he wrote about his views on how to best reform the examination system, particularly the examination used by the military, raising it to a level more closely in line with the civil examination, the banning of the publishing of examination essays by non-governmental entities, and the publication and introduction of the Xiaojing into a regular rotation of questions based on the Classic in examinations. In 1655, Wei was promoted to the post of principal vice censor-in-chief and was responsible for the administration of the metropolitan military examination in that year. In 1659, Wei made a petition to the emperor critical about infanticide and the drowning of little girls in the southeastern provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian. The Shunzhi Emperor agreed with Wei and issued an edict against Infanticide.
Sometime between 1659 and 1661, Wei left his position as censor and held no position in office. When the Shunzhi Emperor died in 1661, Wei was recalled to serve as censor during the regency period of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor.
Career under Kangxi.
During the regency period of the Kangxi reign, Wei Yijie used his high position as principal vice censor-in-chief to influence the regency leadership in reforming the Examination system that was in place. In his work "Keju yi", Wei expresses his disdain of the examination format used at the time, which placed great emphasis on the Eight Legged Essay, recommending instead examinations which focused more on the policy aspects of the exams by placing them in the first session of examinations and moving the Eight legged Essay to a later session of the exam. Wei's preference to policy questions was due to his belief that scholars chosen for their response to these questions would benefit the dynasty because these scholars would be very knowledgeable about the issues that affected China. In 1663, the Ministry of Rites announced a format change to the examination system that matched what Wei had proposed, which would take place in the 1664 and 1667 exam years.
Wei was an advocate for the resumption of the requirement for Bannermen to take examination, which had been rescinded in 1657 due to provincial instability, in order to obtain office in the central government. Wei believed that for the dynasty to continue to exist, Bannermen would need to adhere to the same standards that other officials met in order to maintain an effective central government. In 1663, due to the influence of Wei proposals, translations for the examinations were made in Manchu, Mongolian, and Hanjun. Later in the Kangxi reign, translations were discontinued and all Bannermen were required to take examinations in Han Chinese. In 1665, Wei was made a Grand Secretary of the Nei Mishuyuan, one of the Inner Three Academies. In 1670, Wei was promoted to Minister of Rites and conducted ceremonial and literary assignments such as editing the Shunzhi Veritable Record. Wei fell ill in early 1671 and resigned from his position in the Ministry of Rites and subsequently retired from official service and was given the title of Grand Mentor of the Heir Apparent in 1672 for his service to the Qing Dynasty. Wei remained in retirement until his death on April 27, 1686.
Religious views.
Wei Yijie was officially a follower of orthodox Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi, but is believed to have been a secret Christian in his private life. Wei is known to have compared Christianity and Confucianism in a positive manner in a testimonial on the seventieth birthday of the Jesuit missionary Johann Adam Schall von Bell.

2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships – Men's long jump

The men's long jump at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships took place on 2 March 2018.
Summary.
With only 15 entrants, the event went straight to the final. On the third jump of the competition, Radek Juška did a 7.99m. It turned out to be his best of the day. Only Juan Miguel Echevarría was able to do better in the first round, his 8.19m put him into the lead. In the second round, Ruswahl Samaai and defending champion Marquis Dendy both jumped 8.02m, with Samaai holding the tiebreaker. Samaai solidified his position on his third attempt with an 8.05m. His teammate, reigning outdoor champion Luvo Manyonga was in jeopardy of not getting any more jumps with two fouls. His 8.33m took him from last to first. The fourth round got more serious; Echevarría jumped 8.36m to take back the lead. Next on the runway, Manyonga bettered that with an African indoor record 8.44m. In the fifth round, Shi Yuhao's 8.12m pushed Samaai off the podium. The next jumper Dendy pushed Shi off with an 8.42m, putting himself in silver medal position. Jarrion Lawson improved to 8.14m on the next jump and two jumpers later, Echevarría hit the winner . Nobody was able to improve their position in the final round.
In addition to being the 2018 world leader, Echevarría's jump made him the number seven indoor performer of all time. Manyonga's jump has him tied for number nine on that list, with Mike Powell and Larry Myricks. Dendy's jump ranks tied for number fifteen.
Results.
The final was started at 19:35.

Lorenz energy cycle

The Lorenz energy cycle describes the generation, conversion and dissipation of energy in the general atmospheric circulation. It is named after the meteorologist Edward N. Lorenz who worked on its mathematical formulation in the 1950s. 
Description.
Introduction.
Any atmospheric circulation system, whether it is a small-scale weather system or a large-scale zonal wind system, is maintained by the supply of kinetic energy. The development of such a system requires either a transformation of some other form of energy into kinetic energy, or the conversion of the kinetic energy of another system into that of the developing system.
On a global scale, the atmospheric circulation must carry energy polewards, because there is a net gain of energy in the tropics through incoming solar radiation and net loss of energy in high latitudes through thermal emission. At low latitudes, where the Hadley cell takes shape, the poleward transport of energy is done by the mean meridional circulation. At mid-latitudes in contrast, the influence of longitudinally asymmetric features, referred to as eddies, is dominant over the mean flow. For a closer examination, it is useful to split all parameters (e.g. P) into their zonal-mean (denoted by an overline, e.g. ) and their departures from the zonal mean due to orography, land-sea contrasts, weather systems and any other eddy-like features (denoted by a prime, e.g. P').
Energy reservoirs.
The available potential energy is the amount of potential energy in the atmosphere that can be converted into kinetic energy. In a statically stable atmosphere, the zonal-mean available potential energy is approximated as:
where formula_2 is the integral over the Earth's entire atmosphere, ρ0 is the mean density of air, N is the buoyancy frequency, a measure of static stability, Φ is the geopotential and z* denotes a log-pressure coordinate.
Eddy available potential energy P' is approximated as:
Zonal-mean kinetic energy is approximated as:
where u and v are the zonal and meridional components of air velocity.
Eddy kinetic energy K' is approximated as:
Sources, sinks and conversion of energy.
The description of the Lorenz Energy Cycle is completed by a mathematical formalism for the generation of potential energy through diabatic heating, its conversion to kinetic energy through vertical motion of air and the dissipation of kinetic energy through friction. A conversion of zonal-mean energy to eddy energy and vice versa is possible where eddies interact with the mean flow and displace warm/cold air.

Lucius Pullaienus Gargilius Antiquus

Lucius Pullaienus Gargilius Antiquus was a Roman senator, who held a number of offices in the imperial service during the reign of Antoninus Pius. He is known to have been a suffect consul in the early years of the reign of Marcus Aurelius, most likely in the year 162. He is known entirely from inscriptions.
His "cursus honorum" is partially known from an inscription set up at Marmaraereglisi / Perinthus in Thracia. Antiquus began his career as one of the "decemviri stlitibus judicandis", one of the four boards that form the "vigintiviri"; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. Next was commissioned military tribune with Legio III Gallica, which was stationed in Syria. He was appointed quaestor as a candidate of the emperor, and upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy Antiquus would be enrolled in the Senate. Two more of the traditional Republican magistracies followed: plebeian tribune, then praetor around the year 150.
After stepping down as praetor, Antiquus was appointed curator of the "viae tres Trajana": the Via Clodia, Via Cassia, and Via Ciminia; Alföldy dates this office from around the year 152 to around 155. Then he was commissioned "legatus legionis" or commander of Legio I Minervia from around the year 155 to around 158. The third office he held before acceding to the consulate was as governor of the imperial province of Thracia, which Alföldy dates from around the year 158 to around 161.
His life after he stepped down as consul is a blank.

Charley's Aunt (1925 film)

Charley's Aunt is a 1925 American silent comedy film directed by Scott Sidney and starring Syd Chaplin, Ethel Shannon, and Lucien Littlefield. It was one of a handful of leading roles for Syd Chaplin, older brother of the more famous Charlie. 
It is an adaptation of Brandon Thomas' 1892 farce of the same name about an Oxford University student who dresses up as a woman to fool a visitor. One of several film versions of the play, it was adapted again by Columbia Pictures as a sound film in 1930. The film was a commercial success, grossing over half a million dollars. It was popular in Germany, where it released by the leading film company UFA.
Plot.
As described in a review in a film magazine, while on vacation, Fancourt Babberley (Chaplin), known to his friends as Babbs, falls in love with Ela (Shannon) and schemes to help her father (Francis), who has lost heavily at roulette. Babbs sends him away and later learns the truth, starts for England with her chaperon Donna Lucia (Jenson). In the meantime, Babbs friends Jack (James) and Charlie (Harrison), on hearing that Donna, Charley's wealthy aunt from Brazil, will visit him, invite their girls Amy (Akin) and Kitty (Bonner) to a luncheon, hoping to propose to them. Donna does not arrive, and Jack and Charley persuade Babbs to use some stage makeup left over from a college play to pose as Charley's aunt. The situation is then complicated when Spettigue (Page), the guardian of the young women who opposes their love affairs, and Jack's father Sir Francis Chesney (Smalley) show up. Both are interested in Charley's aunt because of her supposed great wealth. In the midst of the exciting situation Donna, the real aunt, appears but conceals her identity. Finally, Babbs gets consent for the young women's marriage by promising to marry Spettigue, and then reveals that he has been masquerading. In the end, all is straightened out and Babbs wins Ela while Donna marries Sir Francis, who was her old sweetheart.
Preservation.
Copies of "Charley's Aunt" are located in several film archives including the BFI National Archive, George Eastman Museum Motion Picture Collection, and Academy Film Archive.

List of ancient Ligurian tribes

The Ligures (singular Ligus or Ligur; English: Ligurians; Greek: - "Lígues") were an ancient Indo-European people who appear to have originated in, and gave their name to, Liguria, a region of north-western Italy. Elements of the Ligures appear to have migrated to other areas of western Europe, including the Iberian peninsula.
They had a tribal organization with numerous tribes that are listed below:
Ligures mixed with other peoples.
Celto-Ligurians / Gallo-Ligurians.
May have been Celtic tribes influenced by Ligurians, heavyly Celticized Ligurian tribes that shifted to a Celtic ethnolinguistic identity or mixed Celtic-Ligurian tribes. They dwelt in southeastern Transalpine Gaul and northwestern Cisalpine Gaul, mainly in the Western Alps regions, Rhodanus eastern basin and upper Po river basin.
Possible Ligurian tribes.
In the islands of Corsica and far northern Sardinia dwelt a group of tribes called Corsi (Ancient Corsicans or Paleo-Corsicans) that may have been related to the Ligures or part of them. The Rutuli were a people that some modern scholars think were related to the Ligurians
The Corsi were an ancient people of Sardinia and Corsica, to which they gave the name. They dwelt at the extreme north-east of Sardinia, in the region today known as Gallura.

Eugen Ion Sturza (born December 15, 1984) is a Moldovan politician. He was the Minister of Defence of Moldova under President Igor Dodon and Prime Minister Pavel Filip. Sturza at the time of his appointment was the youngest member of the Filip Cabinet, at 33 years old.
Career.
In 2004, Sturza began his studies at the Academy of Economic Studies of Moldova in Chisinau. After graduating, he became an advisor to Prime Minister Vlad Filat until 2013, when he became the Chief of Prime Minister's Office, a position he kept until 2015. That same year, he became a moderator within the Institute for European Policies and Reforms. On 17 October 2017, the Constitutional Court of Moldova suspended President Igor Dodon for refusing to appoint Sturza as advised by the Prime-Minister (the Constitutional Court concluded at the time that the Prime-Minister´s advice was binding for the President and refusal to approve the appointment violated the Constitution). On October 24, 2017, Sturza was sworn in as Minister of Defense against the wishes of President Dodon. In the first 6 months in this position, Sturza has made it a goal to strengthen the Armed Forces where his predecessors did not. He was removed from his post as a result of the 2019 Moldovan constitutional crisis. In his farewell address, Sturza said that he hopes that under his leadership, the ministry "laid the foundation of an army of the future, and the Western model of development will remain the only accepted model for anyone to take over the leadership of the institution."
He is married and has a baby. He is fluent in English as well as Russian.

2018–19 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team

The 2018–19 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team represented Indiana University in the 2018–19 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Their head coach was Archie Miller, his second year as Indiana head coach. The team played its home games at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana, as a member of the Big Ten Conference. The season officially kicked off with its annual event, Hoosier Hysteria, on September 29, 2018.
Despite getting off to a strong start of 12–2, which included 3 conference wins, IU struggled mightily down the backstretch of the season. Riddled with injuries and the inability to shoot, the Hoosiers lost 12 of 13 games before turning things around and finishing the regular season with a 4-game winning streak. Having put themselves back into the conversation for making the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 3 years, the Hoosiers looked to knock off Ohio State in the Big Ten Tournament. With a win, many bracketologists had IU safely in the field. However, the Hoosiers fell short and lost to Ohio State, 75–79. IU was deemed one of the Last Four Out in the NCAA Tournament, so they earned 1-seed in the NIT, where they advanced to the Quarterfinals before losing to Wichita State, 63–73. Thus, the Hoosiers 119th season ended with an overall record of 19–16 and 8–12 in the Big Ten.
Previous season.
Miller's first season was a major remodeling job, starting with laying the foundation of a pack-line defense and valuing possessions. Early in the season, Miller stated practices were 75% defense, 25% offense. That scheme showed early and often, as the Hoosiers struggled mightily throughout the season to find any flow or rhythm on offense, despite the defense making leaps and bounds in the overall rankings of Division 1 basketball. With a surprising early second round loss in the 2018 Big Ten Tournament to Rutgers, 67–76, and losing enough games to keep them out of both the NCAA tournament and NIT, including games in which they were favored, such as Indiana State and Fort Wayne, IU's first season under their new coach came to a disappointing close. They finished with an overall record of 16–15 and 9–9 in the Big Ten.
Offseason.
Departures.
On April 12, 2018, junior forward Juwan Morgan announced he was entering the NBA draft, but he would not sign with an agent. However, on May 29, 2018, it was revealed that he had withdrawn from the draft and would return for his senior season.
Recruiting class.
With the commitment of Romeo Langford on April 30, 2018, not only did Archie Miller recruit his first 5-star player, he also landed IU's first Indiana Mr. Basketball since Cody Zeller in 2011. In addition, he also signed two other finalists for the award in Rob Phinisee and Damezi Anderson. Miller rounded out the incoming class with the second best player from Ohio in Jerome Hunter, as well as another 4-star in Jake Forrester from Pennsylvania; this group of high school seniors comprised a Top 10 2018 recruiting class. Within the state of Indiana, there was a total of four 5- and 4-star 2018 recruits, 3 of whom committed to Indiana. The last addition to the team roster was made on May 3, 2018 when graduate transfer Evan Fitzner of Saint Mary's College claimed the final scholarship available.
Schedule and results.
The 2018–19 season will mark the first time in Big Ten history that the teams will play a 20-game conference schedule. The new schedule will also include a regional component to increase the frequency of games among teams in similar areas. Over the course of a six-year cycle (12 playing opportunities), in-state rivals will play each other 12 times, regional opponents will play 10 times, and all other teams will play nine times. Three in-state series that will be guaranteed home-and-homes: Illinois and Northwestern, Indiana and Purdue, and Michigan and Michigan State will always play twice.

Weston Bridge Halt railway station

Weston Bridge Platform railway station or Weston Bridge Halt railway station was opened to serve miners travelling to the Ayr Colliery No. 9 Pit that stood near Annbank and those from the village that worked at other pits in the area, East Ayrshire, Scotland. The station was on the line that was originally part of the Ayr and Cumnock Branch of the Glasgow and South Western Railway. The location was well chosen as it lay close to the village, the hamlet of Burnbrae and at the busy crossroads at Weston Bridge.
History.
Little is recorded about the station however it is known to have been operational in July 1936 and July 1938. Wham states that it was used by miners travelling to work at collieries in the 1920s and 1930s. The London, Midland and Scottish railway opened the station as Weston Bridge Halt and had renamed it as Weston Bridge Platform by July 1926. The platform has been demolished and no signs of the station remain at the location.
The now solely freight line running through the station site is still operational (datum 2018), serving the Killoch Washery that lies to the south-east, beyond the village of Drongan.
Auchencruive Colliery Platform was a similar station built for the sole use miners and it was located a short distance to the East of Mossblown Junction, serving the workers of the colliery from 1898 to 1926. Miner's platforms were not unusual and another existed as Bargany Colliery Platform near Killochan on the line to Girvan.
The next station south on the Ayr - Cumnock branch used to be Trabboch, now closed and demolished, near Stair and the hamlet of that name and the colliery served by the railway. Annbank and its junction lay to the north.
Infrastructure.
The station consisted of a single platform located on a curved section of track in a cutting on the eastern side of the single track line below the Weston Bridge opposite the old smithy. The halt was reached via a short footpath and steps running from the road above with vehicular access. Once this track lay close to a crane and siding running from Ayr colliery No.9. The lodge house at the entrance to Enterkine House still stands near by. The platform is not shown to have had a shelter or any other facilities and in addition no signalling appears to have been provided although a signal was located at the junction for Ayr Colliery.
A slight raised area is all that remains of the station together with the path that once led to it.

Hannu Krankka

Hannu Krankka (birth year unknown - died c. 1630) was one of the leaders of Finnish peasants during the 1596-97 Cudgel War, the largest uprising (with about 3,000 casualties) in what is now the country of Finland when it was under Swedish rule. The peasants, including those in Krankka's home region of northern Ostrobothnia, rebelled against oppression, including often unbearable borgläger-type taxation.
In early 1597, midway into the war after the uprising's first leader Jaakko Ilkka had been executed, the bailiff Israel Laurinpoika with the help of Perttu Palo and Krankka recruited more than 3,000 men. Krankka, a veteran leader during war with Russia, was chosen to serve as commander over companies from Liminka, Kemi and Ii.
In February 1597 the leaders and peasants went to Ilmajoki. While preparing for a major battle here, Laurinpoika said he was going to leave to gather more men to fight but fled instead, causing disorganization. Additionally, the peasants had relatively primitive weapons, such as clubs and spears, to use against the well-equipped troops of Clas Fleming serving under Sweden's King Sigismund. The peasants were defeated at this, the final battle, with many casualties. Krankka was captured and imprisoned at Turku Castle. Later that year when Duke Charles (the future King Charles IX of Sweden), an enemy of Sigismund, took control of the castle, he was freed.
In more recent times Krankka and the other peasant leaders are remembered as being part of what some historians consider being the first movements toward Finland's independence. Krankka's uprising days are the subject of Kaarlo Kramsu's 1887 poem, "Hannu Krankka." In 2005, a bronze statue of Krankka by sculptor Niilo Rikula was erected near Liminka, Finland.

Zelda F. Gamson

Zelda Gamson (born March 12, 1936) is an American sociologist, writer and activist. Her scholarly work has primarily focused on the sociology of higher education, in particular innovation and change.
Personal life and education.
Born Zelda Finkelstein in Philadelphia, Gamson is the daughter of Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. She attended public schools in Philadelphia, and studied at the University of Pennsylvania and Antioch College before completing her undergraduate degree at University of Michigan in 1958.

Career and scholarship.
Gamson's doctoral dissertation about Monteith College, an experimental college for non-elite students at Wayne State University, brought her into the orbit of David Riesman, with whom she later co-authored an in-depth study of mass higher education. Her early research focused on student organizations, student-faculty relations, higher education within Israeli kibbutzim, minority experiences on college campuses, and mass education. She later became involved in national efforts for higher education reform, with a particular focus on undergraduate educational practice. Her work has centered on the ways higher education is and can be organized for civic engagement and the common good, as well as on stratification and inequality in higher education. Her most notable work in this arena includes "Liberating Education" (1984), "Seven Principles for Good Practice in Higher Education" (1987, with Arthur Chickering), "Applying the Seven Principles of Good Practice in Undergraduate Education" (1991, with Arthur Chickering), and "Revitalizing General Education in a Time of Scarcity" (1997, with Sandra Kanter and Howard London). The "Seven Principles" continue to be widely circulated in settings such as college teaching and learning centers, as well as in the development of pedagogy and educational technology. Gamson was an invited member of the Study Group on the Conditions of Excellence in Undergraduate Education sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education's National Institute of Education. Foundations that have supported her research include the Carnegie Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Mental Health, the Ford Foundation, the Lilly Endowment, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the Pew Charitable Trusts. She has also written for non-academic publications such as "Jewish Currents."
Gamson spent more than seventeen years at the University of Michigan, with appointments at the Institute for Social Research, the Center for the Study of Higher Education, and the Residential College. In 1988, she moved to the University of Massachusetts in Boston, where she founded the Higher Education Doctoral Program and was the Founding Director of the New England Resource Center for Higher Education (NERCHE).

Robert de Bruce Trotter

Dr Robert de Bruce Trotter MB LRCPE LRCPSG (1833–1907) was a 19th-century Scottish physician remembered as an author and poet often writing under the pseudonym of Mrs Maria Trotter. Under the further pseudonym Saxon he "edited" his own texts. His books therefore appear as written by Mrs M Trotter and edited by Saxon. This presumably gave appeal and credibility to both male and female readers.
Life.
He was born on 25 July 1834 in Dalbeattie in Galloway, the eldest of four sons to Robert de Bruce Trotter Sr, all sons becoming physicians. His mother was Martha ("Maria") Nithsdale. The family moved to Auchencairn soon after he was born. He was educated there then in 1846 went to work in a law office in Glasgow.
He left the law office to study Medicine at Glasgow University graduating MB ChB around 1854. As a physician he practiced in Galloway, and began collecting local folktales and anecdotes.
He retired to Tayview House, 2 Tay Street in Perth, Scotland.
He died in Perth on 3 December 1907 and is buried in Wellshill Cemetery in the north of the city. The grave lies on the south wall of the southern path linking to the Jeanfield section.
Family.
He was married to Helen Finlay Baird (1851-1917).
Principal works.
In an attempt to reintroduce his work to a contemporary audience, selections from "Galloway Gossip" were included in the anthology "The Sound of our Voices" edited by Pete Fortune and Liz Niven, published by Dumfries and Galloway Libraries (2000). Further selections, and an essay on Trotter himself, by Pete Fortune, were published in the journal of the Scots Language Society, "Lallans" in 2001.

He ran in the 2018 primary election to become the San Diego County Sheriff against his boss and 9-year-incumbent, Bill Gore. He is currently the highest ranking openly gay employee in the department, and would have been the first openly gay San Diego County Sheriff if elected. He lost on June 5, 2018 with 43.4% of the vote. He retired from the department after his defeat. Following Gore's retirement, Myers announced he would run again for the Sheriff's position.
Career.
Dave Myers has worked for the San Diego Sheriff's Department since 1985. He became a Commander in 2012 and is currently the highest ranking openly gay employee in the department.
Sheriff candidacy.
Dave Myers announced his run for San Diego County Sheriff in February 2017 against his boss and 9-year-incumbent, Bill Gore. If elected, Myers would have been the first openly gay San Diego County Sheriff. Myers claimed to have experienced several instances of retaliation at work due to his candidacy.
During his run, Myers said the department does not respond well to community issues and criticized Gore's handling of important cases. Myers stated there is a lack of diversity in the force, and believes there needs to be more LGBT, women and minorities serving in the San Diego Sheriff Department. Myers wanted to prohibit the shackling of pregnant inmates while they give birth. He wanted the department to focus on rehabilitation instead of incarceration for misdemeanors and low level drug offenses. Unlike Sheriff Gore, Myers has supported California's cannabis laws, citing the fact that 60% of San Diego residents voted to legalize cannabis in 2016. Myers called for greater transparency in the Sheriff's department and wanted to deploy body cameras for the entire San Diego police department so that videos of important incidents could be made available to the public within 24 hours. 
Gore canceled a debate with Myers due to a scheduling conflict in March 2018. Gore stated he was unable to debate Myers due to laws limiting his ability to talk about employee conduct. In April 2018, Gore said during an interview that he used to be friends with Myers but now wished he could fire him.
On June 5, 2018, Myers lost with 43.4% of the vote to Gore's 56.4%.

Ach, wie wärs möglich dann

Ach, wie ist's möglich dann also known as Treue Liebe (True/Loyal Love), is a German now-traditional song. Friedrich Wilhelm Kücken (1810 - 1882), a German composer and conductor, claimed to have composed the tune, and that it was later modified "probably by Silcher" ("wahrscheinlich von Silcher her") and given the general name "Thüringer Volkslied" ("Thuringian folksong"). Its popularity helped Küchen get chosen for the court of Grand Duke Paul Friedrich von Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The tune is used at West Point, Lincoln University (Missouri) ("Lincoln, O, Lincoln") and Wake Forest University. Marlene Dietrich sang the song and it has been used in a couple of movies.
The lyrics are generally credited to Helmina von Chézy.
"Ach wie ist's möglich, dann
daß ich dich lassen kann!
Hab dich von Herzen lieb,
das glaube mir.
Du hast die Seele mein
so ganz genommen ein,
daß ich kein Andre lieb,
als dich allein."
"Blau ist ein Blümelein,
das heißt Vergißnichtmein;
dies Blümlein leg ans Herz
und denk an mich!
Stirbt Blüm' und Hoffnung gleich,
wir sind an Liebe reich,
denn die stirbt nie bei mir,
das glaube mir!"
"Wär ich ein Vögelein,
wollt ich bald bei dir sein,
scheut Falk und Habicht nicht,
flög schnell zu dir;
schöß mich ein Jäger tot,
fiel ich in deinen Schoß;
sähst du mich traurig an,
gern stürb ich dann."
"Oh, how is it possible
that I can leave you!
I hold you in my heart,
believe that of me!
You have my soul
taken so completely,
that I love no one,
but you alone.
Blue is a little flower,
that is called forget-me-not;
Lay this bloom upon your heart
and think of me!
Were flower and hope to die,
we would still be rich in love,
because it would never die in me,
believe that of me.
If I were a little bird,
I would soon be with you,
Not avoiding falcon or hawk, 
I would fly quickly to you;
If a hunter mortally wounded me,
And I fell onto your lap;
If you were saddened,
I would die in peace."

Eloise Kummer

Margery Eloise Kummer (June 17, 1916 - August 24, 2008) was an American radio and television actress.
Early years.
Kummer was born in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Martin Kummer. After graduating in 1933 from Sheboygan High School, where she won honors in dramatics, she attended the University of Wisconsin, graduating from its School of Speech. Later, working at the perfume counter in a department store in Chicago allowed her to study "manners of speech, reactions, opinions, and characteristics in general" of women. After working in the store, she began acting on radio.
Career.
Radio.
In October 1937, Krummer successfully auditioned for a part in "Curtain Time" and, as a result, appeared in the program's October 15, 1937, broadcast on WGN. A March 11, 1938, newspaper item reported, "Miss Kummer has been heard frequently on programs over Chicago stations ..." By October 2, 1938, she had been chosen as a member of the permanent cast of "Fortunes of Emily" on WGN.
Kummer's roles on radio programs included those shown in the table below:
In 1957, Kummer was co-host with Josh Brady of two 15-minute daily talk programs on WBBM in Chicago. "The Eloise and Josh Show" aired in the mornings, and "The Josh and Eloise Show" was broadcast in the evenings.
She returned to radio drama in 1980, taking the role of Circe in a 12-hour, $1.5 million National Radio Theater production of Homer's "Odyssey".
Television.
In 1949, Kummer portrayed Kay Carter on "These Are My Children", which has been inaccurately described as the first televised daytime soap opera (it was actually preceded by the DuMont series "Faraway Hill" in 1946 and "Highway to the Stars" in 1947), but was the first soap opera strip. Kummer also played Nancy Bennett on "The Bennetts".
State fair narration.
In 1962, Kummer recorded the narration for an exhibit at Hawaii's State Fair. The "talking glass lady" was described in an article in the "Honolulu Star-Bulletin" as "a plexiglass model of a 28-year-old woman." As the exhibit's lighting changed to focus on first one internal organ and then another, Kummer's narration described how each spotlighted organ functioned.
Personal life.
On August 3, 1946, in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Kummer married Raymond A. Jones, an officer of the American Federation of Radio Artists. They had two children and remained married until his death in 1978. Their daughter, Amanda Jones, won the Miss USA title in 1973.

Errol Leslie Buddle (29 April 1928 – 22 February 2018) was an Australian jazz musician.
Errol Buddle was born on 29 April 1928, and raised in Adelaide. Buddle first learned the banjo and mandolin. He began learning jazz after listening to a Bobby Limb performance in 1944. Buddle attended the Elder Conservatorium of Music as well as the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. Influenced by the sound of the bassoon in Igor Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring" and "The Firebird", Buddle began playing the instrument. Over the course of his career, Buddle played fourteen reed instruments and several others. Buddle moved to Melbourne in 1946 and began playing the radio circuit. He relocated to Sydney by 1951 and performed weekly at the nightclub Chequers'. Buddle and Don Varella moved to Windsor, Ontario, in 1952, where Buddle joined the Windsor Symphony Orchestra.
Buddle often performed in Detroit, Michigan, where he met and collaborated with Elvin Jones and Johnnie Davis. Buddle also performed at the jazz club Klein's. The manager, George Klein, eventually asked Buddle to lead what later became the Errol Buddle Quartet. Buddle founded The Australian Jazz Quartet with Jack Brokensha, Bryce Rohde and Dick Healey. The group served as the backing band to several musicians and later played throughout North America before touring Australia in 1958, then disbanded. Buddle performed occasionally thereafter. He died at home in Potts Point, New South Wales on 22 February 2018, aged 89.

The team had no nickname in 1919, with the "Aggie" term being introduced in 1922.
The school did not field a team in 1918 due to World War I. The 1919 team competed as an independent and was led by head coach William E. Bobbitt in his only season as head coach for the school. They played home games in Davis, California. University Farm finished with a record of two wins and five losses (2–5) and was outscored by their opponents 63–109 for the 1919 season.

Breakin' It Up, Breakin' It Down

Breakin' It Up, Breakin' It Down is a blues album by Muddy Waters, Johnny Winter, and James Cotton. It was recorded live in 1977, and released in 2007. It reached number 3 on the "Billboard" Blues Albums chart.
Production.
In January 1977, blues guitarist and singer Muddy Waters released the studio album "Hard Again". It was very well-received, and helped revive Waters' career. It won a Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording. "Hard Again" was produced by Johnny Winter. Winter and James Cotton both played on the album, on guitar and harmonica respectively.
In March 1977, Waters, Winter, Cotton, and the other musicians who had played on "Hard Again" went on a concert tour to promote it. The songs on "Breakin' It Up, Breakin' It Down" were recorded at three of those concerts – March 4 at the Palladium in New York City, March 6 at the Tower Theater in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, and March 18 at the Masonic Temple Theater in Detroit. The concert tapes languished in the vaults of several different record companies, until they were released thirty years later.
In August 1977, Winter released a studio album recorded by the same group of musicians, titled "Nothin' but the Blues".
Critical reception.
On "AllMusic", Richie Unterberger said, "It might have been spurred by a Muddy Waters album, but in fact Waters, Winter, and Cotton all took vocals – sometimes alone, and sometimes on the same song – on stage, and these 11 songs feature the vocals of each of the three in about equal measure... It's undeniable, however, that Waters was, even at this relatively advanced age, by far the most commanding singer of the trio."
In "All About Jazz", Doug Collette wrote, "Waters, Winter and Cotton share the music as well as the stage – a crucial distinction in the dynamics that radiate from "How Long Can a Fool Go Wrong". There is familiar material here, including "Can't Be Satisfied" – Waters' signature tune and first hit – "Trouble No More", and the rousing (albeit somewhat predictable) encore, "Got My Mojo Workin'". There's a palpable sense that these songs are not only finding a new audience, but being rediscovered by the musicians, hence the reciprocal excitement builds through the sequencing of tracks."
In "Vintage Guitar", Dan Forte said, "Not a dull moment is to be found, as Muddy reprises his first hit, "Can't Be Satisfied", and shares vocals with Perkins on "Caledonia"; Winter serves up the Freddie King slow blues "Love Her with a Feeling" and J.B. Lenoir's bopping "Mama, Talk to Your Daughter"; and Cotton fires up "Rocket 88" and mines the deepest of all shuffles on "How Long Can a Fool Go Wrong".
On "Blinded by Sound", Josh Hathaway said, ""Caledonia" is one of the high points on this set and best examples of what Waters' presence means to a song. His performance is vital and magnetic and his interplay with Cotton and Pinetop is priceless!... Blues lovers will – and should – flock to this disc. It's not Waters at his best yet it reinforces just what a towering figure he is in the history of the blues and popular music."

Clifford R. Evans

Clifford Russel Evans, (June 23, 1937 – February 14, 2018) was a Canadian trade unionist, pension plan innovator, and a key player in the creation of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.
Early life.
Evans was born in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, on June 23, 1937.
Activism and career.
Evans became a member of the Retail Clerks International Union (RCIU) in 1957 when he organized the workers at the Dominion Store in Guelph, Ontario, where he was employed. 
That same year he was elected vice president of RCIU Local 206, and two months later, at the age of 19, he became its full-time secretary treasurer.
In 1960, he was appointed international representative for the RCIU, focused on southern Ontario, and in 1969 he returned to Local 206 to become its president.
In 1970, the Canadian region of the RCIU was created with Evans elected as the union's first Canadian director.
When the RCIU merged with the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America in 1979 to create the UFCW, Cliff was elected director of region 19, and an international vice president, at the new union's founding convention.
As director of region 19, Evans set a new standard for worker organizing in Canada, scaling the region's total membership from 5,000 in 1957 to 65,000 in 1986.
Evans also led UFCW through one of the largest union battles in Canadian history, which took place during the 1980s and involved the Canadian Auto Workers raiding more than 25,000 UFCW members in Newfoundland who worked as fisherman.
In 1988, regions 18 and 19 of the union merged to create the UFCW Canadian council and a singular national office, and Evans was elected the union's first director representing the entire Canadian membership. 
Evans served as the UFCW Canadian director until his retirement in 1992.
Awards.
Evans was awarded the Order of Ontario in 1996 for his commitment to workers and, in particular, his role in creating the Canadian Commercial Workers Industry Pension Plan, which, since its founding, has become Canada's largest multi-employer pension plan with more than $2.3 billion in assets, 275,000 members, and 180 participating employers.

2018 Sittwe bombings

The 2018 Sittwe bombings were a series of three bomb blasts in Sittwe, the capital of Myanmar's Rakhine State. One police officer received minor injuries from the blasts.
Background.
Ethnic Rakhine insurgent groups have been fighting the government of Myanmar since the early 1950s. Bombings are not uncommon in Myanmar due to the various ongoing insurgencies in the country, but they have been a rare occurrence in Rakhine State. However, Rakhine State has experienced an increase in guerrilla-style attacks by insurgents since 2016.
Bombings.
One of the bombs exploded at around 4:30 am (MMT) in the backyard of a residence belonging to Tin Maung Swe, a state government secretary, whilst the other two went off near a high court and a land record office. The blasts slightly injured a police officer. Authorities suspected that Swe was targeted because of his high position in the local administration. Three unexploded bombs were recovered and defused by authorities afterwards.
Investigation.
Seven suspects were arrested by the Myanmar Police Force immediately after the bombing, whilst two others were detained later in the investigation. Naing Soe, a senior leader of the Arakan National Council (ANC) was among those arrested.
On 26 March 2018, the police released five of the nine suspects, including Naing Soe, after they failed to find evidence against them within 30 days as police procedure requires. The released suspects were originally charged under Myanmar's counter-terrorism laws, but their release was ordered by the court after the police failed to show evidence linking them to the bombings. An extension for the police's remand of three of the suspects still detained was approved by the court on the same day; two of the suspects were accused of illegally crossing the Bangladesh–Myanmar border, whilst another was accused of being involved with a bombing in Mrauk U.

Mastodonte dei Giovi (locomotive)

The Mastodonte dei Giovi was a special double steam locomotive built specifically for use on the difficult Apennine stretch of the new Turin - Genoa railway line, inaugurated in 1853.
History.
The construction of the Giovi Railway, which was intended to be the backbone of the Piedmontese railway system connecting Turin to the port city of Genoa, posed the serious problem of how to cross the Giovi Pass with its steep inclines. Initially it was planned to use a rope system with hydraulic motors. However, an international competition announced by the Semmering railway of Austria had brought other solutions more suitable to increase the uphill haulage capacity of the locomotives of the time. 
The Cockerill workshops had studied a solution that met with particular favour. It was a double-boiler locomotive, similar to a Double Fairlie. It had a central firebox on a single long frame, and required a driver and two firemen. This solution impressed the brilliant Italian engineer Germain Sommeiller but he considered it would be difficult to negotiate the sharp curves of the Giovi given the long rigid frame. He then studied an ingenious solution. His machine was composed of two 0-4-0 locomotives coupled back-to-back. The coupling was semi-permanent but was detachable if necessary in case of breakdown or for maintenance. A jointed platform allowed operation with only one driver and one stoker.
The locomotive units were well-proven two-axle machines of Stephenson design. Ten pairs were built, some by Stephenson in England and some by John Cockerill and Company in Seraing, Belgium. A pair of locomotives delivered 382 horsepower and could haul a train of 130 tons at 12 km per hour on a 3.6% gradient. The name "Mastodonti dei Giovi" was borrowed from that of a large fossil found during the excavation of the tunnel near Busalla. The locomotives served until the mid 1870s, when they were replaced by Beugniot locomotives with 4 coupled axles. The locomotives went through several changes of ownership and details are shown in the list below.
Rebuilds.
Following their replacement with more modern machines, the SFAI, between 1870 and 1871, studied their re-use:. Two double units, 76 + 77 and 78 + 79 were divided and rebuilt at the Officine Nuove di Torino as separate tank locomotives. A new longer boiler was fitted and the frame was lengthened by adding a third coupled axle. The "new" locomotives became SFAI 1408-1411. In 1874 four units that had taken the numbers SFAI 1404-1407 were separated and coupled to three-axle tenders. In 1885, following the "Conventions" which assigned the stock of the SFAI to the Rete Mediterranea (RM), SFAI 1408-1411 were renumbered RM 5201-5204. In 1905, only two of these four passed to the Ferrovie dello Stato, nos. 5201 and 5203, and they were re-registered as FS 8231 and 8232 (FS Class 823). In 1907, they were renumbered FS 8151 and 8152 (FS Class 815). They were scrapped between 1911 and 1912 and none has been preserved.

John David Brcin

John David Brcin (; born Jovan Brčin; August 15 1899 - October 31 1983) was an American sculptor and artist.
Background and education.
Brcin was born into a Serb family in Gračac (modern-day Croatia), to parents David and Milica Kesić Brčin as "Jovan Brčin". His father died when he was two years old. After his father's death, Brcin was brought up by an uncle who was a carpenter and mason. As a child, Brcin helped him carve simple wooden objects during the winter months. He immigrated to the United States in 1913 to join an older brother who was working at a bank in Gary, Indiana.
In 1917, Brcin studied sculpture at Chicago's Art Institute, where he received a fellowship allowing him to pursue his studies for one year in Serbia, France and Italy. He obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts from The Art Institute of Chicago and a Master of Arts from Ohio State University.Brcin became a member of the National Sculpture Society in 1935.
He married Blanche Elizabeth Moore in 1923 and died in 1983 in Boulder, Colorado.
Career.
Brcin's style relied on traditional portraiture and streamlined designs, as well as sharply cut geometric details done in bas-relief. He received various public commissions throughout the United States and also taught at several art schools.
In 1929, Brcin became the official sculptor during the construction of the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, Nebraska. He carved the building's pink marble exterior panels, featuring figures of Native Americans and European settlers. He also sculpted the memorial tablet to George Joslyn, various column and pilaster capitals, and the rosette designs of several entrances. According to the Chicago Herald-Examiner, "Brcin’s carvings are a new thing; they are full of dynamic thrust, a smooth sharp-edged symmetry which admirably interprets the spirit of an age governed by machinery." Brcin also designed the museum's "Sioux Warrior" statue which was only completed in 2009 using his original plaster prototype.
In 1948, Brcin produced the Governor Horner State Memorial, a granite monument located in Chicago, Illinois. The outdoor sculpture illustrates the career of Henry Horner, the 30th governor of Illinois. Originally erected in Grant Park, the memorial can now be found in Horner Park.
In addition to commission work, Brcin was hired in 1922 to teach modeling and drawing at the Minneapolis School of Art. From 1923 to 1924, he headed the sculpture department at Milwaukee's Layton School of Art. He later taught modeling at Rockford College for two years starting in 1934.
Exhibitions.
During the 1920s, Brcin participated in several group exhibitions, as well as having a one-man show in Chicago which subsequently. traveled to the Brooks Memorial Gallery in Memphis, the Art Institute of Omaha, the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, and the Witte Museum in San Antonio.
He later exhibited at New York's National Academy of Design, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, The Art Institute of Chicago, the Detroit Institute of Arts, The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (MFAH), the Legion of Honor (museum), the Brooklyn Museum, the Albright–Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, and the Milwaukee Institute of Art &amp; Design.
His work is represented in permanent collections at the University of Illinois, Roosevelt University, and the Evansville Museum of Arts, History and Science located in Indiana.

He described it in an interview: "I went through an identity crisis that almost completely destroyed me when I was on that show. All of that said, my experience on Top Model was incredible and life changing. It was a very positive thing. I just wish I could've desensitized myself to all of the pressure I was receiving to 'man up' or to ‘act straight.’"
Tyra Banks also helped Hindorff get through some tough times during the show: "She told me that what I had to offer was polarizing…and that I should use that to my advantage. That advice has served me very well! She was also the one who recommended that I get into event hosting and red carpet hosting! I've made most of the money I've earned in 2015 through hosting at events and on red carpets so she definitely knew what she was talking about! I love her endlessly."
After his run on the 20th cycle of ANTM he returned for three cameos on the next season.

Julio C. Arteaga

Julio C. Arteaga (29 October 1867 – 1923) was a Puerto Rican musician and composer of danzas.
Early years.
Julio Carlos de Arteaga Matheu (a.k.a., Julio Carlos Arteaga Matheu) was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, on 29 October 1867 to Diego Arteaga Lopez, from Venezuela, and Isabel Matheu. He had two siblings, Juan Jose and Herminia Isabel.
Professional career.
A composer and musician from Puerto Rico, Arteaga's musical performances were not limited to Puerto Rico, and he traveled to New York City often performing there as well. Among his many musical awards, at a music competition in Paris he won First Prize in Piano Performance in 1890.
Music school.
After teaching music theory and music lessons out of his home for a while, in 1898 he co-founded the "Asociación Musical de Puerto Rico" (Puerto Rico Music Association). In that same year he and Felipe Gutiérrez Espinosa, another outstanding Puerto Rican composer, approached Governor Guy V. Henry with a proposal to establish a music institute in San Juan. While the project never materialized due to lack of interest in Governor Henry's administration, it gave birth to the idea of establishing music schools independent of the public instruction system.
Together with his wife, Nicolasa Torruellas, he founded the Arteaga Academy in Ponce, where they taught piano, music theory, organ, and
voice, among others. Among his pupils was Monserrate Ferrer Otero ("Monsita Ferrer"), and Mercedes Arias. This last one, Mercedes Arias, was the failed love of Juan Morel Campos, the woman he loved but could never marry, and on whom Morel Campos found inspiration for several of his great masterpiece danzas, including "Maldito Amor" (Damned Love), "No Me Toques" (Don't Touch Me) and "Alma Sublime" (Sublime Soul). He returned to New York City where he had studied violin and works as organist at St. Patrick's Cathedral from 1920 to 1923. He died in New York City in 1923.
Family life.
Arteaga married Daría Nicolasa Torruellas, also a musician, with whom he had five children, four boys (including Pedro [1903–], and Julio Carlos [1907–]), and a girl. The girl, Genoveva, would become an outstanding musician herself.

Metastereotype

In social psychology, a metastereotype (or meta-stereotype) is a stereotype that members of one group have about the way in which they are stereotypically viewed by members of another group. In other words, it is a stereotype about a stereotype. They have been shown to have adverse effects on individuals that hold them, including on their levels of anxiety in interracial conversations. Meta-stereotypes held by African Americans regarding the stereotypes White Americans have about them have been found to be largely both negative and accurate. People portray meta-stereotypes of their ingroup more positively when talking to a member of an outgroup than to a fellow member of their ingroup.
Ingroup vs. outgroup in meta-stereotyping.
The ingroup vs. outgroup phenomenon, originally described by sociology and social psychology, has been closely tied to human stereotyping and meta-stereotyping tendencies. While "ingroup" is commonly defined as a social group to which an individual belongs, the "outgroup" is a social group with which the individual does not identify. The criteria for group membership include but are not limited to one's race, culture, nationality, ethnicity, age, gender, religion, and sexual orientation.
The tendency to favor one's own social group is called an ingroup bias, and it can be both explicit (conscious and controllable) and implicit (unconscious and instinctual). The realistic conflict theory, social identity theory, and optimal distinctiveness theory aim to explain the ingroup bias and its possible negative impacts on the outgroups. Favoritism of one’s own group does not always lead to discrimination of and hostility towards outgroups. However, racial prejudice was found to be closely related to the development of social cognition in children around the age of 5 years. 
Social projection, which is a tendency to attribute one’s own feelings and attitudes to others, is also important for understanding how the ingroup vs. outgroup phenomenon relates to meta-stereotyping. Humans tend to project and share their own social attitudes to the other members of the ingroup. For example, members of a dominant Australian group who held more negative attitudes toward members of a low status Australian group perceived greater ingroup agreement and support for their attitudes .
Social projection is important for understanding of the role of ingroup vs. outgroup in meta-stereotyping. Tajfel (1981) stated that "no social group is an island", and, therefore, it is likely that members of a particular group are aware of the opinions other groups held about them (e.g. the members of punk subculture may believe that the dominant non-punk culture perceives them as rioters). When an ingroup believes that the outgroup perceives the members of the ingroup negatively, it can reversely increase the negative stereotypes, prejudice, and hostility about the outgroup. For example, a dominant group of White Canadians held negative stereotypes about a lower status group of Aboriginal Canadians when the dominant white group thought that the lower status Aboriginal group held negative feelings towards them. Such behavior is traditionally called "outgroup meta-prejudice".
"Ingroup meta-prejudice" also exists, and it describes the way the individual members of the ingroup understand the ingroup’s collective stereotypes about a particular outgroup. For example, individuals belonging to Indonesian Sunni Muslim group held negative stereotypes about the way their own group perceived two outgroups; Ahmadiyya and Christians.  Interestingly, research indicates that that ingroup meta-prejudice can mediate the effects of outgroup meta-prejudice on prejudice (i.e. ingroup members’ beliefs about the way the ingroup perceives the outgroup can influence the stereotypes and the meta-stereotypes about the outgroup held by the ingroup). For example, a member of a biker group may believe that his group of bikers thinks that outsiders perceive them as criminals. Such interaction between ingroup and outgroup meta-prejudice can strengthen prejudice and stereotypes in an individual.
Furthermore, ingroup members may attempt to modify the perceived stereotype held by the outgroup about the ingroup (i.e. meta-stereotype) to their advantage by confirming the positive traits and disconfirming the negative ones. For example, a group of undergraduate Belgian students (ingroup) were more likely to confirm self-identified meta-stereotypical traits about the Belgian population in front of a French audience (outgroup) when the trait was positive and disconfirm it when it was negative. Such attempts to present the ingroup in a more favorable light was not present when the audience was Belgian (ingroup).
Meta-stereotypes can have positive effects on the interaction between the ingroup and outgroup as well. Italian students (ingroup) were found to experience more enjoyment from expected interaction with African immigrants (outgroup) when informed that the outgroup perceives them positively. Members of minority (ingroup) who endorsed a high-dependency meta-stereotype (i.e. belief that the ingroup is dependent on the outgroup) also tend to seek more help from the outgroup, even if help-seeking reversely confirms the dependency meta-stereotype
Effects of meta-stereotypes on the individual.
The holding of certain types of meta-stereotypes has been shown to have adverse effects. For example, people who are exposed to negative meta-stereotypes about their own group tend to have lower identification with their ingroup, and that individuals may avoid seeking needed help if by doing so they may confirm negative stereotype of their group.
Other studies have shown that individuals facing meta-stereotypes tend to feel more anxious interacting with members who were not from their own racial group, and that individuals who identified negative meta-stereotypes tended to be angrier and have fewer positive attitudes towards the outgroup. Meta-stereotypes have also been associated with lower anticipated enjoyment in intergroup interactions, higher levels of anxiety in interracial conversations, and negative racial attitudes.
Meta-stereotypes have also been linked to negative effects in the workplace. Meta-stereotypes were linked to lower employability beliefs for stigmatized groups. For example, women and minorities in the workplace showed increase self-doubt, lower self-esteem, and undermined attitudes towards their ability to obtain a job. Research has also shown that meta-stereotypes affect older age individuals.  Due to meta-stereotypes about age, older workers were found to perceive less work opportunities, which leads to a greater desire to retire. In general, negative meta-stereotyping is associated with more negative individual self-view.
Awareness and endorsement of meta-stereotypes have been linked to negative effects on the individual. Research supported that awareness of negative meta-stereotypes was both directly and indirectly linked to poorer health and increased alcohol use. The research revealed that being aware that others held negative stereotypes about an individual’s race, helped predict negative mental health outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, and hostility. This in turn predicted reduced self-care behaviors and increased the use of drugs and alcohol for coping.  Embracing meta-stereotypes have also been linked to negative effects in black women. Black women who endorsed the meta-stereotypes were more susceptible to engage in risky sexual behaviors binge drinking, and marijuana use.
Meta-stereotypes across different populations.
Minorities.
When majority members of a population felt that the minority members wanted to seek contact with them, their meta-stereotypes about themselves were more positive and that led to them having more positive attitudes about the minority group.
The collectivistic meta-stereotype of Asians may lead them to think that they need to be more of an individual. This self-perceived notion of individuation may lead to tension with their culture and a continuation of their stereotype to relieve this tension.
White Americans may hold the meta-stereotype that Black Americans perceive them negatively. The majority of Black Americans surveyed believed that White Americans think Black Americans are more likely to commit violent crimes, are better athletes, are less intelligent, would rather live off welfare than work, have low moral standards, are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, are always whining about racism, are lazy, have no self-discipline, and are religious. These meta-stereotypes are perceived at a higher rate by Black Americans than the rate at which White Americans actually report believing these stereotypes.
Another example of meta-stereotypes can be found between Aboriginal and White Canadians. Aboriginal Canadians perceive White Canadians as egocentric, lacking feeling, prejudice, ambitious, and high status. Conversely, White Canadian’s meta-stereotype of Aboriginals was perceived as lazy, rebellious, lacking ambition, low status, unscientific in nature, and unsociable.
Age.
Younger people hold meta-stereotypes that older people think they are lazy and unmotivated, irresponsible, unreliable, inexperienced and add no value. Older people hold meta-stereotypes that younger people think they are boring, stubborn, and grumpy. These results are not representative of what young people actually think of older people.
Gender.
Men and women typically hold meta-stereotypes about the opposite genders. For example, meta-stereotypes held by men about women include women being affectionate, artificial, attentive, attractive, bad-drivers, bitchy, controlling, fearful, feminine, fussy, gentle, giving, gossipy, insecure, intuitive, moody, multitaskers, nagging, organized, sensitive, shy, soft-hearted, sweet, timid, understanding.
Religion.
Between non-believers and believers, the meta-stereotype about non-believers is being immoral (low in altruism and honesty) and high in extraversion. Non-believers also tend to exaggerate their differences on the topic of meta-stereotypes. Believers that hold strong ingroup bias feel that non-believers see them as dogmatic and dishonest.

Hagar International is a Swiss-based global humanitarian nonprofit organization offering services and assistance to people who have escaped sexual slavery and/or human trafficking. It is focused on helping victims with recovery, and was founded in Cambodia in 1994 by Pierre Tami. Hagar started providing services to Afghanistan and Vietnam in 2009. It expanded to Myanmar in 2014. Hagar International has been noted for working with male victims in addition to women and children. A main goal is to help victims achieve stability and financial independence though skill-based training and job opportunity programs. Hagar International recommends an ongoing process which starts with the victim, then the victim's family, and finally helps integrate them into the community. The organization often works directly with local and federal governments to improve social services. Several children from their special "catch-up" schools have been able to graduate and go to university. They have a legal protection unit, which was established in 2011, and helps provide legal services and representation in court.
Hagar International was named after the biblical character Hagar from the Book of Genesis 16–21. Hagar, a slave, was raped and impregnated by her master, then abused by her master's jealous wife. Hagar ran away, but was forced by God to go back to slavery and bear her master's son. Hagar International's goal is to help people like Hagar who are suffering from sexual abuse.

Jon Parrish Peede

Jon Parrish Peede is an American book editor and literary review publisher, who served as the chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities from 2018 to 2021.
Early life.
Jon Parrish Peede was born in Mississippi, and he grew up in Brandon, Mississippi. His father was Dr Robert Louis Peede Sr and his mother, Mary Ann Parrish. He has three brothers.
Peede graduated from Vanderbilt University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in English. He attended the University of Mississippi, where one of his professors was William R. Ferris, and he earned a master's degree in Southern Studies. Peede and Ferris both served as chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities.
Career.
Peede was a book editor for the Mercer University Press from 1994 to 1996. He served as director of publications and later director of communications at Millsaps College from 1997 to 2003. He worked for the National Endowment for the Arts in senior roles from 2003 to 2011, including four years as director of literature grants. He was the publisher of the "Virginia Quarterly Review" at the University of Virginia from 2011 to 2016. 
When William Drea Adams resigned as the chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities in May 2017, Peede became "the Trump administration’s new liaison to the N.E.H.". As acting chair in October 2017, he acknowledged that President Donald J. Trump wanted to eliminate the agency or at least reduce the budget. In March 2018, Peede was nominated by President Trump to become the new chair of the NEH. He was confirmed in April 2018. With bipartisan support in Congress, the agency budget dramatically increased during Peede's tenure from $147.9 million to $167.5 million. He also oversaw the federal agency's awarding of $75 million in CARES Act funding in direct grants and through state humanities council partnerships. 
In January 2021, Peede resigned as the head of the federal agency. In a press release, the NEH credited him with creating a new category of grants to support infrastructure and capacity-building at humanities institutions, awarding emergency grants for cultural organizations affected by natural disasters, funding a partnership with the First Nations Development Institute to support the revitalization of Native American languages, and creating the “A More Perfect Union” grant program to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States in 2026. 
Peede is a frequent advocate for improved K-12 teaching of U.S. history and civic education, and he awarded funding to create the Educating for American Democracy initiative that included 300 higher education and nonprofit partners and scholars. In partnership with the Teagle Foundation under the leadership of Andrew Delbanco, Peede provided NEH funding to support faculty salaries and programmatic expenses for undergraduate general education programs that include classics as well as contemporary literary works by authors of diverse backgrounds.
Peede is the co-editor of a collection of essays about Flannery O'Connor. He has written for numerous journals, magazines, and other publications, often on Southern culture.
His awards include an honorary degree from Manchester Community College in New Hampshire in 2019 and the President’s Medal of Distinction from California State University, Fresno in 2019. 
Personal life.
Peede has a wife and a daughter.

Counterattack (newsletter)

Counterattack was a weekly subscription-based, anti-communist, mimeographed newsletter, which ran from 1947 to the 1950s and was published by a "private, independent organization" of the same name and started by three ex-Federal Bureau of Investigation agents.
Formation.
In May 1947, "a group of former FBI agents" founded a "private, independent organization" called Counterattack.
Description.
The full title of the publication was "Counterattack: The Newsletter of Facts on Communism".
The weekly subscription-based newsletter headquartered at 55 W. 42 Street, New York.
"Counterattack" was available by subscription and on news stands and in stores for one dollar in New York City. An annual subscription cost $24. Its target subscribers included "Security Officers, Personnel Directors, Employment managers and all sorts of people whose business requires them to know the facts about the background of organizations and/or individuals." By 1949, "Counterattack" had earned some $200,000 in revenue.
In 1952, "Time" magazine reported:["Counterattack"] never paid salaries of more than $6,000 a year, and it paid only a few dividends of $1 each on its 1,000 shares of stock. Its special research jobs for corporations, ad agencies, unions, etc. now account for about 5% of its income; the rest comes from "Counterattack".
Mission.
Its self-proclaimed "principal functions" were to:
Counterattack staff.
Staff members included:
ABC (publisher).
Alfred Kohlberg, an American textile importer and an ardent member of the anti-communist China Lobby, funded the group, registered as American Business Consultants, Inc. (ABC) in 1947, "an extremist group of corporate and ex-government personnel." Affiliates of ABC included Lawrence Johnson (owners of a supermarket chain in upstate New York) and Jack Wren (former Naval Intelligence officer at BBDO advertising agency). (Kohlberg was also an original national council member of the John Birch Society.)
Keenan served as ABC president, Bierly as vice president, and Kirkpatrick as secretary-treasurer.
ABC offered a service costing $5 to investigate people. Newsletter subscribers (clients) included: Bendix Aviation, Du Pont, General Motors, Metropolitan Life, R.J. Reynolds, and F.W. Woolworth.
History.
In 1946, Kirkpatrick and Bierly were implicated in "pirating" of security informants for "Plain Talk" magazine and soon thereafter for "Counterattack" newsletter. Kirkpatrick and Bierly also used FBI information to capitalize upon their FBI association. Together with Keenan, they formed first "John Quincy Adams Associates" in Washington, DC, and then "American Business Consultants, Inc.", in New York City, publisher of "Counterattack" newsletter.
On March 26, 1947, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) to air his views on communism. Hoover said:The mad march of red fascism is a cause for concern in America. But the deceit, the trickery, and the lies of the American communists are catching up with them. Whenever the spotlight of truth is focused upon them the cry, "red baiting." Now that their aims and objectives are being exposed they are creating a Committee for the Constitutional Rights of Communists, and are feverishly working to build up what they term a quarter-million-dollar defense fund to place in ads in papers, to publish pamphlets, to buy radio time. They know that today it is a fight to the finish and that their backs will soon be to the wall.The Communist Party of the United States is a fifth column if there ever was one. It is far better organized than were the Nazis in occupied countries prior to their capitulation. They are seeking to weaken America just as they did in the era of obstruction when they were aligned with Nazis. Their goal is the overthrow of our government. HUAC's investigations gathered momentum after Hoover's speech – and, shortly after that speech, "Counterattack" launched publishing.
Political counterattacks.
As early as December 1947, "Counterattack" had denounced the presidential aspirations of former U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace and his Progressive Party. It tracked other political parties that supported the Progressive Party, including the American Labor Party and the National Farmers Union. It also attacked American labor unions, particularly the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACW) and their support (CIO) or not (ACW).
In late March 1948, "Counterattack" had started to seek to rally its readers to take action against communists and communist organizations.
In May 1948, "Counterattack" denounced the communist opposition to the Mundt-Nixon Bill.
On July 2, 1948, Keenan and Kirkpatrick testified before the Special Subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor. Kennan described himself as publisher of "Counterattack", ABC president, and Brooklyn resident: he also notice service as FBI agent from 1942 to 1948. Keenan further testified that he was a lawyer and partner in the firm of Alexander and Keenan. Kirkpatrick described himself as managing editor of "Counterattack", ABC secretary-treasurer, and Queens resident: he noted service as FBI agent from 1941 to 1945. Kirkpatrick further testified that, after the FBI, he had worked for Macy's and then joined ABC in June 1946. They claimed to have some twelve employees, who included other ex-FBI agents. Among them were Jeremiah Buckley (head of research) and Harry Morgan (former vice president of the American Communications Association-CIO union). They stated circulation at that time ran between 1,400 and 1,500 subscribers.
In 1949, "Counterattack" denounced the Scientific and Cultural Conference for World Peace (July 1949) as a communist-front plot.
By 1949-1950, Ed Sullivan was consulting "Counterattack" Kirkpatrick for guidance on whom to avoid as a "pinko".
HUAC and Red Channels.
In October 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) began investigating the influence and infiltration of communism in Hollywood, which some regard as a prelude to McCarthyism and others regard as the beginning of the Second Red Scare. A period of blacklisting in the Entertainment industry began with a contempt of Congress charge against the "Hollywood Ten".
American Business Consultants were part of a larger network, which included HUAC, which researched allegedly communist-related activities of individuals and organizations. Composed of several former FBI agents, ABC obtained information from the FBI and had access to the files of HUAC.
On June 22, 1950, "Counterattack" published a special issue, "Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television", with intent to "expos[e] the most important aspects of Communist activity in America each week."
"Red Channels" shook the Entertainment industry. Starting in August 1950, Young &amp; Rubicam advertising agency and its radio and television program-sponsoring client General Foods ran into "pinko" issues over "The Aldrich Family" and "The Goldbergs".
In September 1950, "Billboard" magazine published an exposé "The Inside on 'Counterattack'", which promised the "full story of paper and operators", an "ex-FBI foursome".
Peak.
In 1951, Bierly left the newsletter. He claimed that "Counterattack" had "changed into an opinion and editorial sheet—short on facts and long on opinion." He also admitted that Red Channels had led to "lots of people getting kicked around". He set up his own research outfit with Columbia Pictures as an initial client.
In 1952, "Counterattack" seems to have peaked at 7,500 subscribers. By late June 1952, "Time" magazine reported, Kirkpatrick, AKA "Mr. Counterattack", had left the newsletter for "primarily personal reasons".
Decline.
In mid-March 1948, actor Fredric March and his wife Florence Eldridge sued "Counterattack" for defamation and damages of $250,000. "Counterattack" settled with them out of court–"an expensive lesson" in libel.
The first publication whose accusation against "Counterattack" for "extortion-style" tactics stuck was a weekly newsletter called "In Fact" in an article dated July 17, 1950.
Lawsuits against "Counterattack" seemed to have stopped its publication by 1954, 1955, or 1958 though the organization (and ABC) seem to have survived until 1968 or even 1973.
Archives.
The right-wing Church League of America obtained research files from American Business Consultants.
Bloomsburg University's library has made several issues available in PDF format online.

After Twenty Years

"After Twenty Years" is a short story written by O. Henry, first published in his anthology, "The Four Million" in 1906.
Plot.
Jimmy Wells and Bob were raised in New York City and grew up as very close friends. Their paths diverged when Bob moved west to make his fortune and Jimmy stayed in New York as young adults. Before they parted, though, Bob and Jimmy agreed to meet in twenty years at the restaurant where they last saw each other.
After twenty years have passed, Bob is waiting for Jimmy at the appointed spot. A policeman on patrol stops to question, and Bob tells the policeman his story. Bob boasts of how well he has fared and tells the policeman that he does not doubt that Jimmy will show up.
Later, "Jimmy Wells" arrives, and as they walk into a lighted area, Bob discovers that this is not the same Jimmy he knew, because twenty years cannot change a man's nose. The man reveals himself to be a plainclothes policeman who arrests “Silky” Bob, a wanted criminal. Before going to the police station, he gives Bob a letter from Jimmy. Bob reads it and realizes that the policeman he met earlier was in fact, Jimmy Wells. In the letter, Jimmy explains that when he arrived at the designated spot and realized that his old friend, Bob, was the criminal that police were on the lookout for, he did not have the heart to arrest him. Instead, he sent a plainclothes officer to do so.

Macrobiotus shonaicus

Macrobiotus shonaicus () is a species of tardigrade in the family Macrobiotidae. it is only known from its type locality: Tsuruoka, Japan. The species description was published in 2018. The insides of their first three pairs of legs have a slight fold above their claws, and their eggs have processes whose terminal discs split off into thin filaments.
Taxonomic history.
The species description was written by Daniel Stec, Kazuharu Arakawa, and Łukasz Michalczyk; it was published in "PLOS One" in February 2018.
Arakawa collected ten "M. shonaicus" specimens in May 2016 from moss growing in his apartment building's parking lot, in Tsuruoka, Japan. The moss, "Bryum argenteum", was growing on a concrete surface. One pair of these tardigrades successfully reproduced in vitro, yielding an isogenic strain. The holotype, 57 paratypes, and 34 eggs were deposited at Jagiellonian University in Kraków. An additional 17 paratypes and 7 eggs were deposited at Keio University, Tsuruoka.
The specific epithet, "shonaicus", is named after Shōnai, which the authors describe as "the region in Japan where the new species was collected".
Distribution.
The type locality is , "Otsuka-machi, Tsuruoka-City, Japan".
Description.
Juveniles have a white body, while the body of adults is a slightly yellowish. They have eyes. Round pores with a diameter of 0.2–0.4 μm are scattered over the surface of their legs, their sides, and their backs. The internal surface of their first three pairs of legs have a bulge; these pairs also have an inside fold above the claws. This species is dioecious, but there are no secondary sex characteristics. The measurements of their body lengths range 218–743 μm.
The eggs' color ranges from white to pale yellow and their shape ranges from spherical to slightly ovoid. The full diameter of the eggs range 56.4–70.8 μm. Their surface is covered with protruding inverted goblet-shaped platforms, whose terminal disc is surrounded by "teeth" which extend out into thin, fragile filaments.
Stec and colleagues performed an experiment to see if females could reproduce parthenogenetically. Reproduction was not observed when individuals were separated and not allowed to mate, suggesting they cannot.
Stec and colleagues sequenced four molecular markers: 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, ITS-2, and mitochondrial COI. DNA was sequenced from four specimens. The sequences were submitted to GenBank. Their analysis yielded a single haplotype each for the 18S rRNA and the 28S rRNA and two haplotypes each for the ITS-2 and COI. The most conservative marker with respect to other species in the "M. hufelandi" complex was 18S rRNA, which differed 0.3–3.3% from the available sequences in GenBank. This was followed by 28S rRNA (5.0–9.8%), ITS-2 (11.2–29.7%), and COI (19.6–26.9%).
Phylogeny.
Stec and colleagues' analysis placed "M. shonaicus" in a clade along with "M. paulinae", "M. polypiformis", "M. scoticus" and "M. kristenseni". This clade is within the "hufelandi" group.

Walter Lenck

Walter Lenck (1873-1952) was a versatile German artist - sculptor, draftsman, painter, architect, cellist, composer and dramatist. Escaping Nazi persecution he emigrated in 1936 to Johannesburg, South Africa, where he lived until his death. Between 1911 and 1913 he changed his original surname, Lewy, to Lenck.
Life.
He was born in Berlin on September 2, 1873, son of banker Oscar Lewy and his wife Rosalie, "née" Samuelson, first cousin of her husband.
From a young age he was fond of drawing animals at the zoo and illustrating scenes from Greek mythology, with a special interest in the saga of the Argonauts. Dissatisfied with the work in his father's bank he did sketches of clients. Despite his fondness for drawing he began his artistic career with musical studies and became a virtuoso cellist. Having always been interested in sculpture, he then devoted himself to this branch of art at the Royal Academy in Berlin as a disciple of the sculptor Paul Friedrich Meyerheim, simultaneously continuing architecture studies, and then in Paris, where he was influenced by the school of Antoine-Louis Barye and in Brussels with Constantin Meunier. After completing his studies, he made a living painting portraits until he earned a reputation as a sculptor.
In 1910, the German government sent his monumental sculpture "Jason" to the International Railway and Land Transportation Exhibition, one of several held that year in Buenos Aires on the occasion of the centenary of Argentine independence. Still as Walter Lewy the artist traveled from Hamburg, embarking on the steamer König Friedrich August on May 21. At the International Art Exhibition, held at San Martín Square, he presented three bronze sculptures.
The reason is not known, but by the end of 1913 and perhaps when he moved to Vienna he had already changed his surname, since he appeared as Walter Lenck, cellist, in a December announcement that year of a concert to be held there in January 1914. He would spend fourteen years in Vienna where, without neglecting his sculpture, he developed a wide-ranging musical activity as a cello and viola da gamba instrumentalist, and participated in design contests for public monuments.
In 1916 he organized an exhibition of his architectural and sculptural works in a room at the Musikverein, which he personally rented. The contract stipulated that the association would receive in payment the amount collected from the sale of tickets, once the installation and administrative expenses incurred by the artist had been covered. The show would open on May 2 and would extend, in principle, for a month; it received favorable reviews.
That same year, Lenck was one of the founders of the Collegium Musicum in Vienna, an organization dedicated to rescue and disseminate works of ancient music by German composers, performing frequent concerts in which he played the cello and viola da gamba.
In September 1922, Gertrude Richardson Brigham, a correspondent for "The Washington Times", met Lenck during a visit to Vienna as part of a tour of European capitals. She was interested in contacting painters and sculptors for an exhibition of modern art planned by the newspaper, to be held the following season in Washington. She describes him in an article published on October 22 that included photos of two works by the artist, written under her pseudonym, Viktor Flambeau:
He lived in Berlin until his emigration to South Africa in 1936, where he continued his sculptural work; the catalog of a solo show in Johannesburg in 1945 lists more than a dozen bronzes of animals, his great specialty, and portrait busts, oil paintings and drawings. He did not neglect his activity as a musical composer and dramatist, although he had to stop playing the cello for medical reasons.
He died in Johannesburg on August 13, 1952, aged 78, and was buried there.
Work.
Sculpture.
The monumental "Jason and the Bulls of Aeëtes" presents the hero when he has just subdued the two ferocious fire-breathing animals, the first of the tasks called for by Aeëtes, king of Colchis, when Jason claimed the golden fleece.
It was fourteen feet tall without the base and was completed in 1909, at the artist's expense. The German government sent the bronze to Buenos Aires in 1910 and it was installed at the center of the "Parque de las Naciones", in the International Railway and Land Transportation Exhibition, one of several held to celebrate the centenary of Argentine independence. According to different sources it received the Grand Prize, something that has not been possible to verify. The local government tried to buy it for 250,000 marks, but the German government did not authorize the sale. Returning home in 1911 and unable to find a buyer for the piece, the artist lent it to Berlin Zoo, where it was installed in front of the Elephant House. During the inflationary crisis of the mid-1920s Lenck, in need of money, offered to sell it to the city of Berlin but although he did not request a high sum negotiations did not prosper. In 1927 the Leipzig merchant Otto Schultz offered 25,000 marks for the work, of which he paid 20,000. Before the operation was finalized he went bankrupt; a group of anonymous donors led by Johannes Ebbing, director of the Leipzig zoo, finally collected the remaining sum and bought the sculpture. The artist supervised the dismantling of the work in Berlin in February 1928. It was erected in Leipzig Zoo the following May, coinciding with the fiftieth anniversary of the park.
Not everyone welcomed the work in its new destination. The painter Max Schwimmer criticized it harshly in a newspaper article entitled "Jason the Terrible", calling it "monumental kitsch".
In 2015 it was fully restored by the Free State of Saxony at a cost of 33,000 euros and the hero's helmet recovered its original gilding.
Small-scale versions appear occasionally at art auctions.
Throughout his career he made a large number of animal sculptures in bronze. The three pieces he presented at the Centennial International Art Exhibition in Buenos Aires - "Archer", "Lion", and "Buffalo and Lion," appear in the catalog but with no indication of dimensions. An almost life-size version of the third is installed at Memorial Boulevard, Johannesburg Zoo, South Africa, donated by the artist in 1936.
Two sources mention another monumental bronze, "Fighting Mammoths (or Mastodons)". One of them says that it was bought by the Berlin City Council in 1929 and installed in that city's zoo. The park was destroyed in the last days of World War II and the current administration has no records or photographs of this work in its archives.
He made portrait busts of personalities of his time such as King Edward VIII, Paul von Hindenburg, the German president Friedrich Ebert, Chief Rabbi Juda L. Landau of South Africa, R. Wolff and H. Tietz, Gustav Marchet, among others, and a statuette of Empress Zita of Bourbon-Parma with her son Otto, the crown prince. A limited edition of an image of the popular Austrian actor and operetta tenor Alexander Girardi, who had died in April 1918, was advertised in a July newspaper; the piece, 65 cm tall and made of polychrome imitation majolica, was priced at 225 crowns.
Some years later, the Berlin City Council commissioned a work illustrating the Siegfried cycle, but when Hitler assumed power relations with the sculptor broke down and the work was never carried out.
Architecture.
 Lenck designed several monuments, none of which were built, but he presented the plans and models at his 1916 exhibition in Vienna.
The "Monument to Peace and Alliance" stood out; it was conceived to be built on the side of a hill at the border between Bohemia and Saxony, in homage to the unity between Germany and Austria-Hungary. The model appears in photographs published in newspapers, in the poster designed by the architect Otto Polak for the exhibition and in a charcoal perspective by Reinhold Völkel. The great central tower of the mausoleum is surrounded by terraces and galleries, decorated with sculptural groups on pilasters, of two of which Lenck exhibited plaster models.
In 1915 he designed a memorial to the sinking of the Austro-Hungarian submarine U-12 and its commander, Lieutenant Egon Lerch, to be erected in Vienna. The sinking, witnessed by ships of the Italian navy during the war, took place on August 7, 1915, at the Venice lagoon entrance, apparently when the submarine hit a mine. The design combined the figure of the submarine and the letter U into a plastic unit.
Another design was for a "Bulgarian Monument", depicting the meeting in Serbia of three riders - one Austrian, one German and one Bulgarian.
Music and Theater.
Numerous reviews of concerts in newspapers of the time highlight his successful professional career in Vienna as a performer of the cello and the then little-known viola da gamba. His works as a composer, in practically all forms but preferring the symphony, were well received in Germany. In 1936 he was working on a dramatic trilogy, "Emmanuel", a play with musical interludes.

List of United States presidential candidates by number of votes received

Following is a list of United States presidential candidates by number of votes received. Elections have tended to have more participation in each successive election, due to the increasing population of the United States, and, in some instances, expansion of the right to vote to larger segments of society. Prior to the election of 1824, most states did not have a popular vote. In the election of 1824, only 18 of the 24 states held a popular vote, but by the election of 1828, 22 of the 24 states held a popular vote. Minor candidates are excluded if they received fewer than 100,000 votes, or less than .1% of the vote in their election year.
List of presidential candidates by lifetime votes.
The following list indicates lifetime votes received across multiple elections in which the candidate was the nominee of a political party or was otherwise on a presidential ballot. It does include write-in votes that may have been received by candidates in elections in which they were not candidates.

Jump Off Joe (Washington)

Jump off Joe is a butte in the Horse Heaven Hills south of Kennewick in the U.S. state of Washington. Jump off Joe rises above the Tri-Cities and is visible throughout much of the region, including in parts of Umatilla and Morrow Counties in Oregon to the south. A gravel road approaches the summit from the south up a steep incline. On a clear day, visitors to the summit can see Mount Hood, Mount Adams and Mount Rainier.
Jump off Joe's high elevation compared to the surrounding area makes it an ideal location to place towers for radio and television communications. Among these is an amateur radio repeater that provides coverage to much of the Columbia Basin. Two major local television stations, NBC affiliate KNDU and ABC affiliate KVEW have their towers atop the butte. FM radio stations with transmitters on top of the butte include KUJ-FM and KORD-FM.
Geology.
Jump off Joe and the greater Horse Heaven Hills are anticlines within the Yakima Fold Belt. The belt is a series of fault lines extending throughout south-central Washington which are part of the larger Olympic–Wallowa Lineament. The lineament runs from Port Angeles to the Wallowa Mountains in northeastern Oregon.
Rocks in the area are predominantly basalt, part of the Columbia River Basalt Group. Lava flows believed to have originated from the Yellowstone hotspot approximately 10 to 15 million years ago when the hotspot was located in western Idaho. These lava flows covered large portions of Washington and Oregon all the way to the Pacific Ocean in basalt up to thick.
During the Last Glacial Maximum, ice sheets extended into what is today the Idaho Panhandle, blocking the flow of the Clark Fork River creating Glacial Lake Missoula. Over a period of 2,000 years the weight of the water behind this ice dam caused it to break sending a surge of water toward the Pacific Ocean. This water would backup at the Horse Heaven Hills, flowing through and deepening Wallula Gap located a few miles southeast.
Climate and ecology.
Jump off Joe lies in a semi-arid environment within the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains. Being nearly above the Columbia River, Jump off Joe receives more snow than the Tri-Cities and can remain snow covered for much of the winter season. High winds in the area provide an excellent setting for wind turbines to generate power. Like most of the Mid Columbia, the butte is treeless. Plant life includes native grasses and sagebrush.
Annual rainfall at the nearest airport, the Tri-Cities Airport in Pasco is . Afternoon temperatures in the summer can exceed . Jump off Joe frequently lies above inversions that form in the Columbia Basin during high pressure systems in the winter months.

Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig

Time Crisis (referred to as "Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig") is a fortnightly internet radio show hosted by Ezra Koenig and Jake Longstreth. The show began airing on July 12, 2015 on Apple Music's radio service, Beats 1. The show covers a variety of topics, such as politics, corporate food history, 1970s rock music, city living, as well as frequently analyzing the latest in contemporary pop music by contrasting it with music released in another era. In addition to Koenig, a variety of guest hosts have appeared over the show's history, including Jonah Hill, Rashida Jones and Jamie Foxx. Since 2017, Koenig is accompanied by co-host, Jake Longstreth, a YouTuber, who regularly proclaims his love for the "tasteful palette" of early 70's classic rock, plus music from The Grateful Dead, Ween and Guided by Voices.
The show typically airs every two weeks. In March 2020, motivated by the increased number of listeners working from home due to the novel coronavirus, Time Crisis began airing on a weekly basis. As of October 6, 2020, 132 episodes have aired. The show is in its sixth season, as of 2020.
Format and Segments.
The show follows a general format each episode during its two-hour runtime, usually with listener emails and other discussions in the first half of the show and the "Top Five on iTunes" at the episode's conclusion.
News Discussions.
The most common segment on the call, in which Koenig and his co-hosts discuss the most relevant and obscure news topics of the week, generally relating to politics or current happenings in the world of entertainment.
"The Time Crisis Mail Bag".
This has been a regular segment since the show's third season. Initially, the segment began after a fan located Jake Longstreth's personal email. The segment now utilizes the email 8minutecapecod@gmail.com a reference to an episode aired in July 2017 where they joked about the prospect of an 8 minute Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa to be played on the next Vampire Weekend tour.
Fans generally send in questions regarding 1970s music and suggest artists to the hosts that they believe are "tasteful" and fit Longstreth's ideal palette. Another popular topic submitted by fans relates to the corporate food history segment of the show.
Corporate Food History Discussions.
Frequently, Koenig and guests analyse the current landscape of the corporate food industry, as well as looking back on the history of snack foods across the world. In 2016, Jennifer Saenz, chief marketing executive of the Frito-Lay corporation appeared. Additionally, the show has discussed Subway on multiple episodes and their obscure promotions, such as the "Five Dollar Footlong" deal. In 2018, the show highly criticised the "Lady Dorito" proposition by hosting a "Lady Dorito's Town Hall", featuring Rashida Jones and Longstreth's wife and filmmaker, Hannah Fidell.
"Time Crisis Hotline".
Koenig regularly takes phone calls and has intimate discussions with notable journalists, political commentators, corporate food professionals and celebrities. Notable calls have included "Seinfeld" theme composer Jonathan Wolff, Reading Rainbow composer Steve Horelick, and more.
"Jake's Takes".
A recurring segment in which Longstreth recommends or discusses music, with notable recommendations such as The Grateful Dead, Guided by Voices, Ween, Phish, Neil Young, Small Faces and more. Occasionally, Longstreth compiles playlists for Apple Music, notably "The Tasteful Palette of Seventies Rock" and more recently, "Jake's Old Wisdom Playlist".
"Sweet Chili Heat World Premiere".
A segment in which the crew premiere fan generated music. The music is often inspired by events that take place on previous episodes of the show.
"Top Five on iTunes".
Koenig and Longstreth regularly compare and contrast the iTunes chart from the current week with another music chart from the same week in another year. Notably, the show has regularly jokingly criticized the music of Ed Sheeran, such as his 2017 hit, "Shape of You". Koenig and Longstreth commonly refer to the song as "Bed Sheets", in reference to one of the song's lines. Fan response to this criticism has been overwhelmingly positive, with one particular fan even compiling the discussions into a complete 32-minute compilation.
Other Segments.
Other segments have included "New York News".

Christopher Macosko

Christopher W. Macosko (1944) is an American chemical engineer and professor emeritus in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at the University of Minnesota. He is internationally known for his work in polymer science and engineering, especially in the areas of rheology and polymer processing. Macosko is an author of more than 500 academic papers, dozens of patents, and two books including the text: "Rheology: Principles, Measurements and Applications" (Wiley/VCH, 1994). He served as Director of the Industrial Partnership for Research in Interfacial and Materials Engineering (IPRIME), a university-industry consortium at the University of Minnesota, from 1999 to 2018. Macosko and his wife Kathleen have been married since 1967 and are long-time residents of Minneapolis. They have four children and 12 grandchildren.
Early life and education.
Macosko received a B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering in 1966 from Carnegie-Mellon University. He then spent one year at Imperial College, London and obtained an M.S. degree in Chemical Engineering in 1967. Macosko earned his Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering in 1970 from Princeton University, where he worked under the supervision of Bryce Maxwell. His thesis work included the design of a new less-compliant rheometer. Macosko and a fellow graduate student, Joe Starita, co-founded the company Rheometrics, whose instruments have significantly advanced the field of rheology. The company is now part of TA Instruments, a world-leading manufacturer of rheological devices.
Research at Minnesota.
In 1970, Macosko joined the University of Minnesota and become one of the first assistant professors in the then newly combined Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. His research on polymers served as a bridge between the two disciplines, and his leadership helped attract other faculty in this area and contributed to the international reputation in polymers at the University of Minnesota. Macosko's research was centered around polymer processing, with special emphasis on the structure-function relation between polymer morphology and the associated rheological, mechanical, electronic, and other physical properties. He made significant contributions toward understanding the rheology of polymer materials, such as the characterization of network formation during gelation, the elasticity of foams, interfacial area generation in reactive blends, and the viscoelastic character of polymer composites. Macosko's research has addressed a broad range of polymer processing operations including reaction injection molding, extrusion, melt blowing, and coating. His current research interests include network polymerization, nanoparticle reinforced polymer composites, interfacial reaction during polymer blending, and polymerization with phase separation. Macosko has taught short courses for many years on rheological measurements that have attracted industrial interest.
Awards, honors, and professional service.
, Macosko has graduated over 100 Ph.D. students, and has supervised more than 50 postdoctoral researchers. Many of his students and postdocs have become faculty members at major research universities across the world (e.g., Julio Ottino at Northwestern University). Macosko was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2001 for the invention, development, and dissemination of new methods of reactive polymer processing and rheological property measurement. He was awarded the Bingham Medal by the Society of Rheology in 2004. He has also received Charles M. A. Stine Award (now called the Braskem Award) in Materials Engineering and Sciences from American Institute of Chemical Engineers in 1988 at Northwestern University. In addition, Macosko has received numerous awards including the Pall Award for Applied Polymer Research in 1997, the Banbury Award from American Chemical Society in 2006, the International Award from the Society of Polymer Science Japan (SPSJ) in 2008, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Conference on Advanced Molding Technology and Materials Processing in 2012.
Works.
Chris Macosko has authored numerous journal articles describing significant advances in polymer rheology, melt processing, and nanocomposites which includes but is not limited to:
Chris was also the author of two highly influential books:

Port Cresson massacre

The Port Cresson massacre was a lopsided battle that occurred on June 10, 1835, in the territory of modern-day Liberia between former American slaves and descendants of American slaves on the one hand and Bassa forces on the other.
Background.
Port Cresson was a settlement established in west Africa in 1834 at the behest of the Pennsylvania branch of the abolitionist American Colonization Society for purposes of the "repatriation" of freed slaves, and the descendants of slaves, to Africa. At the time of the massacre, it was populated by approximately 130 African-Americans, as well as one Caucasian representative of the Pennsylvania society, Edward Hankinson.
According to R. McDowell, a physician visiting Edina at the time of attack, local slave traders decided they did not want to do business so close to a repatriation settlement and had informed the local Bassa chief, King Joe, that they intended to move their business elsewhere. An "exasperated" King Joe—who was equipped with arms provided by American and European slavers—pledged to drive the settlers out.
Massacre.
On June 10, 1835, Port Cresson was attacked by the forces of King Joe. As the settlers were pacifist Quakers, they lacked arms or any other means with which to defend themselves. Roughly twenty of the Port Cresson settlers were killed outright by King Joe's men, with the remainder managing to flee the bloodshed and escape to the armed settlement of Monrovia, where Hankinson appealed for aid. Meanwhile, King Joe continued on to attack nearby Edina; however, a second indigenous leader, King Bob, intervened to defend the Edina settlement, and Joe was forced to withdraw.
Aftermath.
On learning of the massacre at Port Cresson, Elijah Johnson, a veteran of the War of 1812, assembled a company of 120 armed volunteers and set out on a punitive expedition to engage King Joe. The Monrovia government routed the opposing forces. A peace accord was signed on November 6, 1835. In it, Joe promised to pay indemnifications, stop participating in the slave trade, and submit all territorial disputes to settler courts for adjudication.
Hankinson, traumatized by the attack, refused to return to the devastated Port Cresson settlement. The demonstration of the military power of the Monrovian forces against Joe helped cement the central importance of Liberia among the disparate repatriation colonies being established in west Africa.

Sidney Crawford

Sidney "Sid" Crawford (4 November 1885 – 14 May 1968) was a South Australian businessman born in Victoria.
History.
Edward James Frederick Crawford (c. 1808 – 15 May 1880), at one time a prosperous brewer associated with the Hindmarsh Brewery. He was also a serious trader in real estate, but went bankrupt in the recession that accompanied the drought of 1864–1867 and in 1868 moved with his wife, three sons and a daughter to Victoria, out of reach of his creditors.
His eldest son James John Crawford (7 February 1848 – 17 October 1926) had a privileged childhood in Adelaide, living in North Adelaide and educated at St. Peter's College. An accountant, he moved to Whanganui, New Zealand, where he married, then to Warrnambool and Ararat where, according to at least one reference he had a penurious existence.

Jenkins School, at 75 Pane St. in Jenkins, Kentucky, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.
It was deemed notable "as the largest and finest school to be produced as part of the efforts by Consolidation Coal Company to develop Jenkins, a coal camp, in the coal rich mountains of eastern Kentucky. Jenkins School’s construction in 1912 heralded a dramatic period of coal investment in Jenkins, leading the town to be considered one of the crown jewels of coal towns—Consolidation Coal Company would bring politicians and visitors from all around the United States and abroad to see their accomplishments in this Letcher County settlement. As other Jenkins buildings of this period have been lost to neglect or demolition, Jenkins School and its level of preservation remains as a touchstone to the community’s coal industry heritage."
The school was redeveloped into 26 affordable apartments for senior citizens, and a senior citizens center, in a project completed in 2014.

2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships – Men's shot put

The men's shot put at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships took place on 3 March 2018.
Summary.
Thomas Walsh came in as the defending champion. Five throws into the competition, he threw to improve upon his own Oceanian record set while winning the previous championships. Nobody would beat that mark in the competition, except Walsh himself, first equalling it in the third round then throwing as the final attempt of the day. Indoor marks now being acceptable, that mark moved him to the number 15# performer in the shot put of all time, displacing Ryan Whiting who was in the competition.
The race for the other medals was much more competitive. On their first attempts, Whiting threw 20.96m, Darrell Hill threw 21.06m, David Storl threw 21.14m and Darlan Romani threw 21.23m. Romani and Storl held those positions until the fourth round when, Tomáš Staněk threw 21.44m to move into silver position. Two throws later, Storl matched that mark exactly. With a superior 2nd (and 3rd) best throw, Storl held the tiebreaker. In the final round, Romani couldn't get back on the podium with his 21.37m, a new South American indoor record, then Storl improved on his tie breaking position again.

The men's 60 metres at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships took place on 3 March 2018.
Summary.
Fifteen years after his first silver medal, remarkable 43-year-old Kim Collins returned to yet another World Championship, qualifying for the semi-final round, but he did not start. The favorite in the event was Christian Coleman, just two weeks after his second world record in this event this season. While two American athletes qualifying for the final is not uncommon, two Chinese athletes qualifying for the final might be the sign of a new trend.
In the final, Coleman was out fast, but next to him in the center of the track Su Bingtian was out with him. Ján Volko and Emre Zafer Barnes were also out fast, but faded quickly. Giving ground at the beginning, Ronnie Baker hit his top speed mid-race, about the same time as Coleman reached his. Coleman managed a little separation from Su, while Baker was making up lost ground. Su continued to press Coleman to the line, but Coleman finished strongly with a lean for a metre victory. Su barely held off the fast closing Baker to take the first global medal for a Chinese sprinter. Behind the medalists, Zhenye Xie gave China a 2-4 punch as he barely held off the last to fifth explosion by Hassan Taftian.
Coleman's winning time of 6.37 would have been the world record prior to his other efforts this season. Su improved upon his own Asian record, his third consecutive national record at the World Indoor Championships.

Sando (official)

Sando (alternately Sanduo, San To, Sadowo; Chinese: 三多; pinyin: Sān Duō; Mongolian: Сандо; 1876－1941) courtesy name Liu Qiao ( 六橋) was a Qing dynasty and later Republic of China civil servant who most notably served as the 62nd and last Manchu "Amban" (昂邦 ; Resident Commissioner) of Outer Mongolia from 1909 to 1911. Although ethnically a Mongol, Sando's aggressive implementation of Beijing ordered reforms, including increased immigration of Han Chinese to the area and a rapid buildup of a sinicized military to fend off growing Russian influence, aggravated Mongols and precipitated moves by Khalkha nobles to declare independence from China in 1911.
Early life.
Sando was born in 1876 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, as a member of the White Banner of Mongolia. He studied under the prominent Chinese scholar Yu Yue, and later became a scholar himself. He is also believed to have studied in Japan for a period. At a young age he entered the Manchu civil service and held several high level civil and military offices in Zhejiang, Beijing, and Hohhot. He served as prefect of the Hangzhou government, then was named Director of the Hangzhou Military Academy. In 1902, he moved to Beijing where he became proctor of the Imperial University. In 1907, he became a Counselor on the Board of Civil Administration. In 1908, he was appointed "Fu du-tong" (副都統), or Deputy Lieutenant-General in Guihua (present day Hohhot). He would eventually write at least seven volumes of poetry and took a deep interest in the archeology and history of Mongolia.
Amban of Urga.
Sando was named Amban of Urga (modern day Ulaanbaatar) responsible for Tsetsen Khan and Tüsheet Khan aimags, on November 26, 1909. Upon his arrival in March 1910, he implemented in rapid succession a spate of "New Administration" Qing reform policies and projects. He promoted increased immigration of Han Chinese farmers, which he felt was a more effective way to counter expanding Russian influence in the area than simply garrisoning troops, and built up the Qing military capacity by establishing a Military Training Office under the domineering leadership of Army Chief of Staff Colonel Tang Zaili (唐在礼) who forcibly recruited Mongolians, including lamas, into the cavalry and local Chinese into the machine gun battalion. To enforce law and order, Sando recruited 100 patrolmen and 44 policemen and levied taxes on gold, timber, carriage and camels to subsidize establishment of effective law courts. He introduced improvements to postal operations between Urga and Beijing, the education system, and to heath and sanitation (for example, he introduced street lights to the capital and created the first public toilets). He dispatched agents to investigate Outer Mongolia's natural resource potential, created the Bureau of Cultivation to exploit agricultural possibilities, especially in the central Tusheet Khan area of the country, and planned construction of a railway between the Urga and Beijing.
Local Khalkha Mongols, unsettled by Sando's brutishness and the rapid pace of reforms, viewed these moves as little more than a purposeful colonization of the country. Sando's support suffered further following the Deyiyong Incident in April 1910. When a price dispute between Mongol monks and Chinese carpenters in Urga quickly devolved into a riot, Sando responded harshly, personally leading the armed response at Gandan Monastery, the principal monastery in the city. The protesting lamas pelted him and his troops with stones, forcing them to withdraw. Outraged, Sando demanded that the Mongolian spiritual leader, the Jebstundamba Khutuktu, surrender a particular lama believed to be the ringleader of the incident. The Khutuktu refused and Sando fined him. In response, representatives of the Jebstundamba Khutuktu petitioned the Qing government to remove Sando, but without success.
Other incidents followed, all underscoring Sando's diminishing authority. A minor noble, Togtokh Taij, with a small band, had with the connivance of local Mongolian officials plundered several Chinese merchant shops in eastern Mongolia. Two detachments of soldiers sent by Sandoo to capture Togtokh were killed after being lured into a trap. Mongolian princes resisted providing soldiers for Sando's army. And the prince of the khoshuun which Togtokh had raided refused Sando's demand to pay compensation to the plundered Chinese merchants.
Sando and his entire administration were eventually despised for their oppressive tactics. Opposition to Sando's administration continued to spread, in particular to Tang Zaili's heavy-handed attempts to tighten military control over Outer Mongolia. Tang's tactics eventually led to his recall after Mongolian leaders and the Russian Ambassador put pressure on Beijing. However, with Qing rule collapsing, Sando found support from Beijing dwindling. Believing that his position was untenable, Sando wired the Beijing government asking for permission to resign, but his request was denied.
Delegation to St. Petersburg.
Sando's forcefulness was one factor in the decision of Mongolian nobles, among them Prince Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren, Da Lam Tserenchimed, and Mijiddorjiin Khanddorj, with the blessing of the Jebstundamba Khutuktu, to send a delegation to St. Petersburg in 1911 to seek Russian backing for Mongolian independence from China. In a letter to the Russian government, the Mongolian delegation accused the Qing of aggressive colonization of Outer Mongolia, creating Chinese administrative units, weakening the power of local Mongolian government institutions, and replacing Mongolian garrisons with Chinese troops along the Mongolian-Russian border. They proclaimed their intention declare independence to save their country from the fate of overt colonization by ethnic Chinese as suffered by their Inner Mongolian kinsmen.
On learning of the Mongolian mission to Russia, the Qing government instructed Sando to investigate. Sando immediately summoned the head of the Khutukhtu's ecclesiastical administration (Ikh shav’), the "Erdene Shanzav" Gonchigjalzangiin Badamdorj, and demanded an explanation. Badamdorj, pleading that he had not been involved, revealed the entire plot to Sando, who then demanded that the Khutuktu withdraw his request for Russian troops. The Khutuktu agreed, provided that Sando dismantle the New Administration. Sando cabled to Beijing for instructions, and was told that parts of the New Administration could be delayed.
The moment was ripe for conciliation. Sando chose to bully instead. He ordered the princes in Urga to sign a statement that only a few individuals had been responsible for the appeal to Russia. The princes did give such a declaration, but only orally. Sando then ordered the Mongolians to have no further contact with the Russian consulate, threatening in case of disobedience to bring an additional 500 troops to Urga and to arm the Chinese population in the city. He posted sentries around the Khutuktu's palace with orders to bar Russian visitors. And he sent a contingent of troops to the Russian-Mongolian border to intercept the Mongolian delegation to Russia on its return.
Mongolian independence.
In the meantime, the Mongolian delegation to Russia secretly returned, and reported the results of its trip to a group of princes and lamas. They composed a joint memorial to the Khutukhtu asking what Mongolia should do in lieu of the provincial uprisings. He advised that Mongolians form a state of their own. On December 1, 1911, a delegation of nobles and lamas visited Sando's office, and informed him of their decision to declare independence and to install the Khutuktu as emperor. Sando pleaded with the delegation. He admitted that what had come to pass was the result of his own folly, and he promised to recommend full autonomy for Mongolia, but not independence. The delegation curtly replied that it had come simply to deliver a message, not to debate it. Sando was ordered to leave the country within 24 hours. There was little Sando could do. He had only 150 troops, who in any event were in an unruly mood because of arrears in back pay. On the following day, his soldiers were disarmed by Mongolian militiamen, as well as Russian Cossacks of the consular convoy under command of Grigory Semyonov, future Ataman. Sando and his staff moved into the Russian consulate compound for their own safety and then were escorted to the Russian border by Cossacks on December 5.
After Mongolia.
From there, Sando travelled to Mukden in Manchuria, where he received a telegram expressing the emperor's astonishment over Sando's inability to control the Mongols. The Amban was removed from office, and he was ordered to await an inquiry into his conduct. The fall of the Qing dynasty in February 1912 saved him from further embarrassment, or worse.
Sando continued his public career in the newly established Republic of China. In October 1912 he was appointed Deputy Lieutenant-General in Mukden , and the following month he was concurrently named Deputy Lieutenant-General of Jinzhou. In September 1920, with the support of Zhang Zuolin he became the director of the Beijing Bureau of Emigration and Labor. In December 1921 he became Chief of the Bureau of Civil Appointments in the cabinet office. In June 1922 he was named Associate Director of the Famine Relief Bureau, and in October of the same year he was named head of the College of Marshals. Information about the last years of Sando's life is vague. However, it is believed he died in 1941.

2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships – Men's 1500 metres

The men's 1500 metres at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships took place on 3 and 4 March 2018.
Summary.
Two disqualifications and three national records highlighted the heats.
In the final, 2012 champion, Abdelaati Iguider jumped out to an early lead, with the American pair of Ben Blankenship and Craig Engels immediately behind him. The entire field jogged through the first 400 at warm up pace, 1:15.84. Blankenship found himself in the lead, looking around as if, "where is everybody?" At 600 metres, in 1:52.48, finally 18 year old Samuel Tefera came forward, the pace quickened slightly. He was joined by teammate Aman Wote and the pace began to get quicker, though still not 30 per lap pace. 800 metres in 2:23.68. Iguider came back to Tefera's shoulder, both speeding up to run a 28.49 lap, 1000 metres in 2:52.16. Blankenship held on to their back, Wote boxing him in on the outside. A 27.38 lap for 1200 in 3:19.54. Jake Wightman ran out in lane 3 to run around the crowd into third place as Iguider squeezed into the lead on the inside. With 300 metres to go, Marcin Lewandowski, known more as an 800 metres runner, was at the back of the pack, but he too moved to the outside and started sprinting past the field, reaching Wightman at the bell. Wightman held Lewandowski to the outside of the penultimate turn but on the backstretch, he passed and set off after Tefera and Iguider. A 25.38 lap, 3:44.84 would have won the race most years, but they still had 100 metres to go. It came down to a final 50 metre sprint on the home stretch. Tefera passed Iguider and ran away to victory, with Lewandowski in full sprint behind him. A desperate Iguider began leaning five metres before the finish, but he couldn't hold off Lewandowski speeding past for silver. For Iguider, it was his second bronze medal in this event, to go along with the complete set of medals he had already collected between 2010 and 2014.
The winning time of 3:58.19 would be a slow mile time in this era. Tefera had run significantly faster, setting the World Junior Record in the event at 3:36.05, just 36 days earlier. That was his first experience on an indoor track.

Faygoluvers

Faygoluvers is a website originally dedicated to horrorcore music, and eventually included underground music as a whole. It was founded in 1999 initially to cover news relating to Insane Clown Posse and other similar artists. Over time, the website evolved to include the underground music community as a whole. They provide news articles, album reviews, music videos, free songs, filmed concerts, new interviews, upcoming events, and more. There is also featured content, such as the annual FLH Music Awards, the Unreleased Underground music archive, an Underground Spotlight section, a weekly podcast, and various other editorials.
History.
Faygoluvers was originally created by Ricky Winowiecki, a fan known as Faygoluver. It was initially created to follow the latest from the horrorcore rap duo Insane Clown Posse, and other associated acts from their record label Psychopathic Records, such as Twiztid, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Myzery, Psychopathic Rydas, and the then-upcoming supergroup Dark Lotus. Although originally containing only news articles, the site evolved to include more content, such as album reviews and free music.
Over time, ownership of the website was switched over to another prominent figure known as ScottieD. Also, due to the increasing popularity of horrorcore music as a whole, more artists than just Insane Clown Posse started to be covered. This ranged from Tech N9ne of Strange Music, Kottonmouth Kings of Suburban Noize, and more. Although rap/hip-hop was still the main focus, other genres started to be covered as well, mainly rock/heavy metal. Due to many other websites offering news postings, Faygoluvers eventually started to include original content; thus, an entire archive of interviews, videos, reviews, songs, and more started to compile together.
The website also has its hand in other ventures as well. The Faygoluvers Mixtapes was a continuous project released exclusively on the website using its namesake as a record label. The annual DCG Con includes a tsuro tournament hosted by Faygoluvers itself. Faygoluvers also provides hourly coverage at the Gathering of the Juggalos, and have made prominent appearances at other public events. In addition, every year since 2014, there is an awards ceremony highlighting the underground music scene, known as the FLH Music Awards, complete with its own voting system and uploaded ceremony.
In popular culture, Faygoluvers is mentioned in the liner notes for Insane Clown Posse's 2002 album . They are also mentioned in the song "Dot Com" by Dark Lotus off their 2001 debut album Tales From the Lotus Pod.

Post Collegiate.
Enekwechi threw over twenty metres in the shot put for the first time in 2016. He won his first national title at the 2016 Nigerian Championships in Sapele with a distance of 19.60 m. He chased after the Olympic qualification shot put mark of 20.50 m but only managed a best of 20.45 that year. It was in 2017 that he first represented Nigeria internationally. At the London World Championships, he did not make it out of the qualifying round. He also represented Nigeria at the 2018 World Indoor Championships.
2018 was a breakthrough year for Enekwechi. At the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, he won a silver medal behind Tom Walsh with a throw of 21.14 m. At the time, this was a personal best for him. Enekwechi then went on to win the shot put title at the African championships in Asaba later in the year. His winning mark of 21.08 m is the African championships record.

2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships – Men's 4 × 400 metres relay

The men's 4 × 400 metres relay at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships took place on 3 and 4 March 2018.
Summary.
In the heats, the Dominican Republic rested their star, disqualified silver medalist Luguelín Santos. They didn't qualify and Santos did not get to run the final. Similarly, USA was able to rest their stars, Michael Cherry and Aldrich Bailey while successfully qualifying for the final.
In the final, USA was out fast with Fred Kerley having a marginal edge at the break, but extending it by running an efficient tangent from lane 6, netting himself a 3-metre lead over Poland's Karol Zalewski. Zalewski kept that gap for most of the second lap, losing a little ground in the handoff. Kerley's split 44.84. The Borlée brothers, represented by Dylan Borlée, representing Belgium were an equal gap back. With an efficient handoff to Michael Cherry, USA gained another 3 metres. Through the second leg, Rafał Omelko chipped away at Cherry's lead, by the time the handoff took place, the gap between USA and Poland was back to 3 metres. Behind them, Jereem Richards brought Trinidad and Tobago past Jonathan Borlée and approached passing Omelko before fading back. Cherry's split was 45.39. The third leg for USA was Aldrich Bailey, vs Poland's Łukasz Krawczuk, Bailey lost another meter as Poland, Trinidad and Tobago and Belgium gained. Bailey's split 46.10. After taking the baton, USA's Vernon Norwood accelerated to open another metre. Behind him, Poland's Jakub Krzewina led the pursuers, with TTO's Lalonde Gordon and Belgium's Kevin Borlée in close order. By the end of the first lap, Norwood had extended the lead to 5 metres, but down the final backstretch, the lead began to shrink. Coming off the final turn, Krzewina had a burst of speed, Norwood straightened up and tightened up, Krzewina went by. Five metres back Borlée was attempting a similar move on Gordon, without as much authority. In a tight battle for bronze, Borlée was able to outlearn Gordon.
Poland's winning time was a new world indoor record, beating USA's team from four years earlier. The final split was timed at 45.44 from when Norwood crossed the line, but considering he made up at least three metres, Krzewina's time was considerably faster. Behind them, Belgium and Trinidad and Tobago set national records.
The Poland 4x400 meter relay team not only made themselves astonished by this unbelievable record, but they astonished everyone in attendance and the world. This world record was the first world record ever set for the IAAF World Indoor Championships. The four men on the relay team, were originally going for the European world record, and not only did they beat that record, but they also beat the indoor world record for the men's 4x400 meter relay. What makes this event even more astonishing, was the fact that the U.S.A. team had also beaten the previous world record for the men's indoor 4x400 meter relay, but were just shy of setting the record themselves after falling short to Poland's team. The previous record was previously held by the United States, and in an unbelievable fashion both teams managed to beat this record in a tight race, the previous time being 3:02.14 from 2014. This amazing accomplishment was not only the new IAAF World Indoor Championship record, but also the indoor world record, truly an astonishing accomplishment.

The women's 4 × 400 metres relay at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships took place on 3 and 4 March 2018.
Summary.
USA, in lane 5 was led off by Quanera Hayes, opening up a slight lead from the gun, but going in to the second turn, Ukraine's Tetyana Melnyk accelerated and hit the break line ahead. Hayes was unable to get ahead of Melnyk, held to the outside of their penultimate turn. Down the backstretch, Hayes was able to ease into the lead, with Jamaica's Tovea Jenkins on her heels. Through the final turn Hayes and Jenkins put a gap on the next pursuer as Melnyk tied up and Poland's Justyna Święty-Ersetic had to make her way around the obstacle. Hayes's split 51.56. With Jamaica now in second place, Janieve Russell squeezed inside of Ukraine's #2 runner Kateryna Klymiuk to take the handoff just behind USA's Georganne Moline, who, with help from the momentary chaos, opened up an additional 2 metres on Russell. Poland's Patrycja Wyciszkiewicz latched on to Russell as Moline expanded the gap to 5 metres after the first lap. There was more than 15 metres further gap back to the British team represented by Hannah Williams. On her second lap, Moline struggled, at one point losing her balance on the steeply banked turn. Russell pulled in the gap, the two teams passing virtually at the same time, with Wyciszkiewicz just a metre back, the split 50.87. USA's Shakima Wimbley got to the turn first and held a 1 metre lead over Jamaica's Anastasia Le-Roy. Two metres back Aleksandra Gaworska kept Poland in the mix. Through her first lap, Wimbley opened up an additional metre on Le-Roy as the two separated from Gaworska. Wimbley's split 51.27. On the anchor, USA had the world champion Courtney Okolo, while Jamaica had their star Stephenie Ann McPherson untested from these championships, a victim of the lane violation disqualification epidemic. McPherson stayed locked to Okolo, more than a metre behind, with Poland's Małgorzata Hołub-Kowalik another 7 metres back. Down the first backstretch, Okolo stretched the lead, but in the second turn McPherson reeled her back in. The second time down the backstretch Okolo extended the lead again and coming off the final turn McPherson took another run at her, closing the gap slightly but unable to make enough progress. USA crossed the line first, Jamaica second, Poland third and distantly, GBR, Ukraine and Italy.
After the race, there was a flurry of disqualifications and appeals. After the dust settled, Jamaica was disqualified for Russell's maneuver at the handoff, advancing Poland to silver and the home team to bronze. Initially, Great Britain were disqualified for obstruction after a protest from the Ukrainian team. As a result, the originally fifth-placed Ukraine team was briefly boosted to bronze, but then an appeal by the British team against the disqualification was successful and the result reinstated.

Distribution.
It is found in South Asian countries like India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh towards Russian Far East of China, Siberia, Japan, Korea to South East Asian Sundaland.
Taxonomy.
The systematics of the species has been considered taxonomically stable since a revision by Yves de Lajonquière (1977). However, by J. W. Tutt, 1902 it was accepted as a member of its own subgenus, "Routlegdia", and then erroneously as the "Orienthrix" by Yuri A. Tschistjakov in 1998.
Description.
Forewings are leaf like with an oblique postmedial yellow patch on the dorsal surface sometimes with a violet saturation. The caterpillar is known to feed on "Dalbergia" species. Adults are found from rainforest and coastal associations. Male has a wingspan of 33–55 mm and 50–70 mm in females. Female is much larger and more robust than the male. Antennae bipectinate (comb like on both sides) in both sexes, whereas the female has shorter rami. Body color is bright lilac reddish. Subspecies "divisa" in Sri Lanka is much darker. The characteristic feature is the pair of large white discal spots, one under the other in each forewing, whereas the lower spot is often covered with reddish scales and less prominent. Hindwings are lightly divided with darker zones.
The female lays spherical eggs where the color ranges from rose to porcelain white with greenish spots. Body of the caterpillar is brown to ash gray. There are black and gray speckles dorsally. The white to yellow colored spots and streaks grouped to form a complete marble pattern. It is a typical tent caterpillar with lateral lappets with two types of setae. One setae is long, elastic, and sparsely haired all over the body. The other setae has small blackish cheta by giving characteristic appearance. Mesothorax bears a dorso-median line of black setae. The caterpillar is known to feed on "Lespedeza" and "Dalbergia" species. Pupation takes place in an elongated whitish papery cocoon attached to the host plant. In Siberia, it is noted that the pupal stage is about 20 days.
Subspecies.
Five subspecies are recognized, along with new subspecies.

Lucius Attius Macro

Lucius Attius Macro was a Roman senator and general, who was active during the early second century. He was suffect consul in the later part of AD 134 as the colleague of Publius Licinius Pansa. He is known entirely from inscriptions.
After serving as praetor, Macro was "legatus legionis" or commander of two Roman legions: Legio I Adiutrix, which was stationed at Brigetio in Pannonia Superior; and Legio VII Gemina, which was stationed in Hispania Tarraconensis. Senators rarely commanded more than one legion in their career; in compiling a list of all men known to have commanded two or more, Anthony Birley identified only thirty-three men. Attius Macro is also attested as governor of Pannonia Inferior immediately before he acceded to the consulate; Werner Eck dates his tenure in that province from the year 130 to 134.
After he stepped down from the consulate, the life of Attius Macro is a blank.

2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships – Men's 60 metres hurdles

The men's 60 metres hurdles at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships took place on 3 and 4 March 2018.
Summary.
Andrew Pozzi led both qualifying rounds to prove he was a leading contender. Four the third championship in a row, France put two athletes into the final, one of them was returning silver medalist Pascal Martinot-Lagarde in his fourth straight final. Outdoor world record holder Aries Merritt also made the final, though expectations for him are not as lofty since his kidney transplant.
After setting his national record as the #2 qualifier in the semi-finals, Milan Trajkovic false started himself out of the finals. Pozzi was the first over the first hurdle, but only inches ahead of Jarret Eaton. Between hurdles, Eaton exploded to almost a foot (30 cm) advantage over the next hurdle, about the same advantage Pozzi held over Martinot-Lagarde. Both Pozzi and Martinot-Lagarde rattled the second hurdle, though Martinot-Lagarde lost more ground being knocked off balance. Eaton extended his lead, doubling it over the third hurdle, which he rattled. Martinot-Lagarde slammed the third hurdle and was out of contention, replaced by his teammate Aurel Manga and Merritt another two feet behind Pozzi. Going over the fourth hurdle, Merritt looked to have a slight advantage over Manga but by the final barrier Manga had the advantage. Eaton slammed the final hurdle, losing some of his momentum, Pozzi caught him before the finish. Manga clearly beat Merritt to the line for bronze.

Caspian-Caucasian Front

The Caspian-Caucasian Front () was a front of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War, formed on 8 December 1918 as a branch of the Southern Front. The Front was disbanded on 13 March 1919 and the troops transferred to form a separate 11th Army.
Operations.
The Caspian-Caucasian Front covered the Lower Volga, the Northern and Western coasts of the Caspian Sea and the Northern Caucasus.
The Front headquarters were located in Astrakhan.
The task of the Front was to have the 11th Army continue the offensive against the Armavir -Tikhoretsk line held by the White troops of Denikin, while the 12th Army was to launch an offensive against Petrovsk - Derbent. 
The troops of the 11th Army were not able to carry out the assigned tasks, as they were opposed by considerable enemy forces.
The 12th Army was also forced to conduct defensive battles in the districts of Kizlyar and west of Guryev. In January 1919, the troops of the 11th Army were defeated in the Northern Caucasus Operation (1918–1919) and in February they retreated over the Manych River into the region of Astrakhan.
On February 4, 1919, the "Stavropol Front" was created to defend Astrakhan. In February 1919, the troops of the Front managed to secure Astrakhan and the mouth of the Volga and to prevent the union of Denikin's troops with the Ural white Cossacks. 
The Front was disbanded on 13 March 1919.

6 High Street, Llandaff

6 High Street is an 18th-century building in Llandaff, Cardiff, Wales. It was possibly built as a one and a half storey building in the early 18th century of thick rubble masonry and in c. 1840 was extended to a three-storey building. It is thought to have been part of the old farm on The Cathedral Green, Llandaff, which was demolished in the early 19th century. Today the building is a teahouse. The building is a Grade II listed structure and it was listed because it is "Included as a largely C18 house and for its group value with the other listed buildings around The Cathedral Green and on the High Street."

Summary.
The two Americans with the fastest times in the semi-final round, Shakima Wimbley and Courtney Okolo were given the outer two lanes in the final, 5 and 6 respectively. Wimbley started quickly, making up a little ground on Okolo's stagger, while Okolo took a more measured approach to her speed, putting on a burst just before the cones, then taking the tangent to lane 1 to take the lead unobstructed. Wimbley closed in much sooner, forcing Eilidh Doyle to squeeze inside to take second position with a lap to go. Okolo just continued to extend her lead, seven metres by the finish for a clear win. Wimbley ran on Doyle's outside through most of the last lap, finally conceding to run the last part of the last turn behind Doyle. On the final straightaway, Wimbley took one more run at Doyle, passing her for the silver. Justyna Święty-Ersetic also closed quickly but could not catch Doyle for bronze.

The men's 800 metres at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships took place on 2 and 3 March 2018.
Summary.
Heats were held on the second day of competition to eliminate only four competitors, one of them turned out to be the world leader coming into these championships, American champion, Donavan Brazier. With lane violations being disqualified aggressively already at these championships, Brazier knew his fate and jogged the rest of his race. Led by Álvaro de Arriba, heat 1 turned out to be significantly faster than the final.
The final started with Mostafa Smaili taking the advantage at the break, edging out Saúl Ordóñez. Ordóñez took up a position on Smaili's shoulder, the rest of the field lined up behind them until two laps to go. Ordóñez moved out to the lead, and 2014 silver medalist Adam Kszczot moved from the back to quickly to take up the second position with Drew Windle covering the move. For the next lap, Ordóñez kept looking over his shoulder while keeping Kszczot at bay. At the bell, Kszczot cruised into the lead, the rest of the field, led by Elliot Giles swarmed forward, leaving Windle out the back. Through the final lap, Kszczot just extended his lead to take a four-metre victory. Behind him, Windle squeezed past Álvaro de Arriba and Smaili on the inside, then slid to the outside on the home straightaway to pass Giles and with a lean at the line, Ordóñez to take silver.
Following the race, Windle was disqualified for obstruction. The decision was later reversed on appeal, reinstating his silver medal.

Agabala Guliyev's House

Agabala Guliyev's house is the former home of Azerbaijani monarch Agabala Gulyev, designed by architect Y.Y. Skibinsky. It impacted the national-romantic movement of architecture in Baku. The architecture of the building has many advantages thanks to its three-dimensional facade, despite the fact that the building was built in narrow streets. Figarov-Fatullayev notes that under the influence of this house, in 1898-1901, Nikolayevskaya (now Istiglaliyyat) street. The building of the Girls School of H.Z.Taghiyev was built on the basis of V. Qoslavsky's project. The building is considered to be of the best examples of Azerbaijan's national architecture, with the importance of Skibinsky's creativity. 
History.
At the end of the nineteenth century, almost all city neighborhoods had been built in the center of Baku. A stylistic trend was formed incorporating different varieties of European architecture, and eclectic environments had begun to be flavored with modernity. 
The first period of architectural development in Baku was about to end; in the new socio-economic conditions, the national-romantic direction opened itself to revival.
Agabala Guliyev was one of the monarchs of Baku who often traveled to Western Europe. He decided to build a house in the traditions of local architecture. He owned several properties in the Icheri Sheher. He was against the European style used in urban buildings, so he hired Skibinsky and ordered him to employ the Shirvanshah's Palace, Middle East and Arabic architecture. As the Shirvanshahs Palace was nearby, Skibinsky acquired photographs of Middle Eastern architecture. This architecture had attracted the attention of European and especially German scholars; albums, trials and other iconographic material were accessible to Skibinski.

Crosier Monastery, Maastricht

The Crosier Monastery or Monastery of the Crutched Friars () is a former monastery of the Order of the Holy Cross in Maastricht, Netherlands. The well-preserved convent buildings house a five-star hotel, the Kruisherenhotel. It is a rare example of a Gothic monastery in the Netherlands, having survived more or less in its entirety. The buildings from the 15th and 16th century constitute three listed buildings ("Rijksmonuments"). The more or less intact monastery archive is unique in the Netherlands.
History.
Foundation.
The Canons Regular of the Order of the Holy Cross (Latin: "Ordo Sanctae Crucis", OSC) was founded around 1210 in the city of Huy, some 30 km south-west of Liège in present-day Belgium. The initiator was Theodore of Celles, a canon of Liège Cathedral and a former crusader. The order was recognized by the pope in 1248. Initially, the order mainly spread in France and England. Later, Crosier monasteries were founded in the Mosan region and elsewhere in the Low Countries, as in Namur (ca. 1248), Liège (before 1270), Asperen (1314), Cuijk-Sint Agatha (1367), Aachen (1372), Venlo (1399) and Roermond (1422).
Around 1400 the Crosiers experienced a period of monastic decline. In 1410 the superior general of the order, Libertus van Bommel, made it compulsory for all priors to annually attend the general chapter of the order in Huy. Thereafter, the priors of monasteries north of Maastricht would stay overnight in Maastricht on their way to Huy. In 1433 this proved to be problematic when all accommodation was booked because of the "heiligdomsvaart", a seven-yearly pilgrimage. A wealthy citizen, Gilles of Elderen, offered the Crosiers a place to stay in some houses that he owned at Kommel. In 1436 Gilles donated five houses with gardens at Kommel, as well as some money, to the superior general of the Crosiers, stipulating that this was to be used for founding a new monastery in Maastricht.
The founding of the new monastery could only happen with permission of the bishop of Liège, the dean of St. Servatius' and the parson of St John's, in whose jurisdiction the monastery was. The latter two gave their permission in October 1437. John of Heinsberg, bishop of Liège, did so in January 1438, allowing the Crosiers to build a walled monastery, including a church, a bell tower, a dormitorium, gardens and a cemetery.
Initially the friars lived in houses donated by Gilles of Elderen. A small chapel was built for celebrating the Liturgy of the Hours. In 1439 the Fraternity of the Holy Cross was founded. Its goal was to promote the devotion to the Holy Cross, as well as to financially support the new monastic foundation.
The founding of the Crosier Monastery in Maastricht in 1438 was part of a wave of monastic foundations within the Order. The Crosier Monastery in Venlo was for most of these – including the Maastricht monastery – the mother monastery. After Maastricht, more monasteries were founded in the Mosan region: Borgloon-Kerniel (1438), 's-Hertogenbosch (1468) and Maaseik (1474). In the case of the latter monastery, the Maastricht Crosiers were the mother monastery.
Construction history.
The first stone of the monastery church was laid in 1440. Petrus Toom and Johannes van Haeren were mentioned as architects (or master builders). In 1459 the choir was finished but it was not consecrated until 1470. In 1462 and again in 1480 the clock tower (or perhaps a ridge turret) was destroyed in a storm. It was replaced by a smaller ridge turret. After a prolonged break, construction continued in 1501 under prior Walterus Beckers of Herentals. The nave and aisles were finished in 1509.
The first section of the new monastery, the east wing, was built in 1480-81. This part housed the sacristy, the chapter hall and a temporary refectory. In 1495 construction of the west wing commenced. The ground floor with the new, permanent refectory was finished in 1500; the upper floor with cells for the friars around 1520. The old refectory became the library, as well as the prior's quarters and a guesthouse. The south wing was finished last by prior Mathias Mijnecom (1517–27) after the old brewery and bakery had been destroyed by fire. Around 1520 the church and monastery had the extent and the appearance that it would keep for the next 500 years.
Monastic life.
The Maastricht Crosiers started in 1438 with four friars. In 1468 there were 15; in 1483 this had increased to 23. In 1500, the Maastricht monastery was among the larger foundations of the order. The fifth prior, Walterus of Herentals (1483-1517), accepted 24 new priests, many of whom came from Maastricht.
The Crutched Friars were friars, living a communal life according to the Rule of St. Augustine. Their first and foremost task was to pray and sing the Liturgy of the Hours. Several of them served as priests in nunneries or third order monasteries in Maastricht, such as the Canonesses Regular of the Holy Sepulchre (Bonnefantenklooster), the Third Order Grey Sisters (Grauwzustersklooster), the Third Order Sisters of St Andrew (Sint-Andriesklooster) and the Alexians (Cellebroedersklooster), or in parish churches in Maastricht or nearby villages, such as Vlijtingen, Bolbeek and Haccourt. Other friars worked as copyists and illuminators of manuscripts, or bookbinders, later also as printers. Others worked in hospitality (the monastery offered accommodation to lay people; the elderly could 'buy themselves into the monastery') or nursing (as during the plague epidemics of 1529 and 1579). A further source of income were mass stipends, as well as the sale of burial rights in the church (for which the church was known). Over the centuries the Crosiers got ever wealthier because of the accumulation of property that people left to them. Most of this property (or income from real estate) was located in the vicinity of Maastricht, mostly in the border region with Belgium.
The Fraternity of the Holy Cross seems to have existed from 1439 until 1579; after that there is no mention of it. Another fraternity was founded around 1510 and lasted till the dissolution of the monastery. It was devoted to the patron saint of the Crosiers, Saint Michael. The fraternities had their own altars in the Crosier church. The Fraternity of Saint Michael possibly ordered a wooden statue of Saint Michael from the famous wood sculptor Jan van Steffeswert in 1512.
Decline.
The monastery was frequently damaged during sieges due to its elevated location near the western city wall. The monastery suffered particularly during the Eighty Years' War. During the Siege of Maastricht (1579) many Crutched Friars died; those that survived perished during the ensuing plague epidemic. For a while the monastery remained uninhabited. In 1581 prior Hubertus of Stavelot sold some of the Crosiers' possessions in order to pay for the repair of the monastery buildings (including the partial renewal of the church's vaults). In 1582 the books that had been shipped to Aachen for safety, returned to Maastricht. After this, the monastery would not reach the same level of prosperity that it had enjoyed before. Where it had previously 25 or more friars, in 1615 it had only 9, and throughout the 17th and 18th century it would never exceed 15.
In 1629 a high ransom was paid for prior Martinus Pauli who had been captured by Dutch militia near Liège and was kept prisoner in Emmerich. More wartime hardship came with the Capture of Maastricht by the Dutch in 1632 and the Capture by the French in 1673. After the siege of 1673, Louis XIV of France donated 2100 guilders to the monastery for repairs. After the French left in 1678, the monastery suffered from forced billeting of the Dutch garrison.
Worldly influence entered the monastery in the 18th century. This became apparent with the wearing of wigs and more fashionable clothing (see drawing above). The enthusiasm of the Counter-Reformation had dwindled, as was the case in other monasteries in Maastricht. The spiritual influence of the Crosiers on their surroundings was negligible, both in Maastricht and elsewhere. Several monasteries were forced to close for lack of friars. In Maastricht, only ten Crutched Friars took holy orders between 1760 and 1796.
List of priors.
From 1438 until 1796 around 30 priors were in charge of the Maastricht Crosier foundation. Initially, the monastery was not allowed to choose its own prior. Later, probably from the 16th century onward, priors were chosen by the so-called house chapter, made up of all priests (friars who had taken holy orders) and presided by the magister general from Huy. A sub-prior (coadjutor) and a manager (procurator) were appointed by the prior, after consulting with the house chapter. In some cases a prior would be procurator too.
Dissolution of the monastery; military use.
The Capture of Maastricht by the French general Kléber in 1794 and the ensuing incorporation of the city in the French First Republic meant the end of all monasteries in Maastricht. In 1796 the Maastricht Crosier Monastery was dissolved. The eight priests and two lay-brothers that remained were forced to leave the monastery within one year. Under French law, those that wanted to remain active as priests had to swear the so-called Oath of Hatred (towards the monarchy and anarchy). Apparently six Maastricht Crosiers refused to do so. As a result they were deported to the penal colony Cayenne. One fled to Germany, another was allowed to return home after he got sick during the voyage, and others were pardoned 
after interference by the Francophile barrister Charles Roemers. Prior Joseph Leurs withdrew to Sittard but was then made prior of the Crosier Monastery Sint Agatha in Cuijk in 1804, where he died two years later. This monastery led a dormant existence with a few elderly friars until the mid-19th century, when it played a key-role in the resurrection of the Order. The dissolution of the Maastricht monastery met with few protests. The institution had outlived itself.
The former monastery buildings were given a military purpose as an arsenal and barracks for the French troops. When the French left in 1814, the Dutch garrison took over the buildings. They were used as barracks, storage for military clothing and the garrison's bakery. Although the former monastery was owned by the city of Maastricht, it was the Ministry of War that decided how it was to be used. When the city housed a cholera clinic in one of the wings, it was told that this was not in accordance with the military purpose. In the 19th century the decaying complex – the only medieval monastery that had escaped destruction – inspired local artists as Philippe van Gulpen (1792-1862) and Alexander Schaepkens (1815-1899).
Agricultural testing station; other uses.
In the late 19th century Victor de Stuers was concerned about the rapidly decaying monastery. Through his contacts with the government in The Hague he managed to find funding for the renovation of the building that was to be given a new purpose. From 1897 onward, the National Agricultural Testing Station ("Rijkslandbouwproefstation") gradually moved into the monastery wings, after restoration by chief government architect Jacobus van Lokhorst. In 1906 part of the east wing collapsed during restoration work. The church was renovated in 1912-14 by chief government architect Daniël Knuttel. Under the church floor Knuttel discovered fragments of a Renaissance tabernacle tower (see description below). The church was then used for exhibitions, meetings and for registering the unemployed during the Great Depression. During and after the Second World War the church was first used by the German occupiers, then by the American liberators and finally by a Dutch organisation that helped to recuperate lost possessions after the war ("Nederlandse Beheersinstituut").
The Maastricht testing station initially did agricultural research for the southern provinces of the Netherlands. It was gradually given additional tasks, as for example the national research on fertilisers and on cattle feed. In 1947 the Crozier church was added to its premises and in 1953 a wooden shed was built into the church, making extra room for laboratories. During the eighty years that the institution was based in Maastricht it always remained an outsider. Most of its personnel came from outside the region. The former monastery buildings were fenced off and remained an alien body in the city. In the late 1970s the institution was moved in phases to Wageningen, closer to the agricultural university there.
The city of Maastricht once again took charge of the buildings around 1980. From 1985-90 the church was used as a temporary parish church for the parish of St. Servatius, whose own church underwent restoration. The church was then used by Opera Zuid for storage and rehearsal studios. Parts of the monastery were briefly occupied by squatters.
Current destination: Kruisherenhotel.
In 2000 the city of Maastricht sold the complex to local entrepreneur Camille Oostwegel, who already owned several luxury hotels and restaurants in the South Limburg region. In 2003-05 the buildings were renovated and re-purposed to house a luxury design hotel with 60 rooms. The renovations were led by Rob Brouwers of SATIJNplus architects. As the building is a rijksmonument, all constructive elements such as the two mezzanines in the church, as well as the entrances, walkways, glass elevators, reception areas and toilets had to be reversible ('box in box' principle). Rob Brouwers added a modern COR-TEN steel pavilion on the south side. German designer Ingo Maurer added a copper tunnel entrance on the north side. Maurer also designed several light sculptures for the cloister yard and the church interior.
At the opening ceremony of the Kruisherenhotel on 1 September 2005, the superior general of the Crosier Order, Rein Vaanhold, said in his speech that the new purpose of the building was consistent with its historical function: making guests feel welcome. The hotel received the bi-annual Monument Prize of the Municipality of Maastricht (the Victor de Stuers medal) in 2005. Also in 2005, interior designer Henk Vos received the European Design Award for his daring design of the hotel interior. In 2011 it was named "hotel of the year" in the Dutch edition of the Gault Millau guide. In 2017 the hotel was officially recognized as a five-star hotel by European Hotel Classification, the only one in Maastricht and Limburg.
Architectural heritage.
Monastery church.
Exterior.
The Maastricht Crosier Church is a spireless, three-, or rather two-aisled monastery church (the south aisle is a pseudo-aisle). It was built between 1440 and 1509 in the local Mosan Gothic style, using local yellow limestone ("Limburgse mergel") on a plinth of bluestone from Namur ("Naamse steen"). The roofs are covered with sheets of slate. The architecture is similar to that of other Gothic monastery churches in the Mosan region, like the Dominican and Minorite churches in Maastricht, which however are two centuries older. The west façade features a (secondary) entrance, as well as a large and a small window, both with pointed arches. The windows had been bricked up in the 19th century but were fitted out with new tracery and colourless leaded glass in the early 20th century. The bluestone finial at the top of the west gable was replaced with a copy around 2004 (the original finial stands in a hotel corridor). The north aisle as well as the north clerestory have five windows, with buttresses in between. The window above the main entrance is blind. The modern entrance by Ingo Maurer has the shape of a tunnel made of copper. The choir has the same height as the nave. Five bricked-up windows of the apse, like the west windows, were reopened and reglazed in the early 20th century. The windows of the choir bays, between the apse and the nave, are blind. Most of the south (pseudo-)aisle is hidden from sight behind the cloisters. Three clerestory windows can be detected from the cloister yard
Interior.
The length of the church (nave plus choir) is ca. 42.6 m (inside measurements); the choir measures 18.1 m and the nave 24.5 m. The total width of nave and aisles is ca. 17 m; the nave by itself 10 m. Both choir and nave are 14.85 m high, the aisles are lower. The choir consists of two bays and a seven-sided apse. Five tall apse windows with colourless glass make the space very light. The nave consists of five bays and has net vaulting, probably dating from shortly after 1579 (see 'History' above). The connection between the choir vaults and the nave is far from seamless and still very much visible. Only the north aisle is a full aisle, 4.5 m wide and 7.7 m high. The pillars between the aisle and nave are of Namur stone. The south aisle is a pseudo-aisle. It is only 2.4 m wide and consists of five side chapels that were built between the buttresses. Three of these chapels are still recognizable as such, the others have been walled off and are now part of the cloisters.
In order to create more usable space for the hotel, two mezzanines were constructed inside the church in 2003-05. The larger mezzanine runs parallel with the nave and part of the choir. It is connected to other parts of the hotel by glass walkways and elevators. On top is a restaurant seating 85. Below is a wine bar and a glass 'wine cellar'. The smaller mezzanine fills the north aisle. It has a reading room on top and lavatories and offices below. An egg-shaped office designed by Ingo Maurer is near the west entrance. All this can be removed without permanent damage to the building.
Murals.
The choir vaults are decorated with murals from the 15th and 16th century that are partly in a poor state. Some of these were completed in 1461 by Master Gerardus but were altered by an unknown hand in 1571. The decorations consist of floral wreaths, the "Arma Christi", angels, busts of monks and knights with banderoles. The text on the banderoles is virtually illegible. A depiction of a cross with the coat of arms of the Crosier Order and two human figures – possibly a Roman and a female saint – may refer to the Finding of the True Cross by Saint Helena.
The south-west chapel contains a large mural, most likely from the second quarter of the 16th century. The main depiction portrays eight scenes from the life of Saint Gertrude: six within a pointed arch on the south wall of the chapel; the other two (originally four?) on the side walls. Depicted are: the birth of Gertrude, the taking of the vows, a bishop consecrating Nivelles Abbey, Gertrude saving a house on fire, and Gertrude saving a ship in a storm. The mural on the west wall shows "Saint Gertrude's love drink" ("Sint-Geerteminnedronk"), the ancient custom to drink to a healthy homecoming of someone who is undertaking a long journey. Saint Gertrude is the patron saint of travellers.
Sculptures.
Both the architectural sculpture in the church and the sculptural fragments that were recovered in 1913 from underneath the church floor, testify of a rich artistic tradition. The massive late-Gothic capitals that adorn the composite columns between the nave and the north aisle, are impressive both in size and skill. The ribvaults are decorated with sculpted keystones and corbels. Beautifully detailed are the four corbels with the evangelists' symbols. Two Baroque altars have been preserved in the south chapels. They are of local limestone with stucco decorations in Louis Quatorze style.
Two interesting reliefs decorate the north and south wall of the choir. The smaller one on the north wall depicts a heart that is pierced by a sword with two hands folded in prayer below. Inside the heart the letters IHS (Jesus) and MA (Mary) have been carved; above it the date 1595. This might be an epitaph that was removed from elsewhere. The larger relief on the opposite wall consists of four vertically arranged parts, partly damaged by a 19th-century mezzanine floor. It probably refers to a "Vidimus" (Latin: "we have seen") of 1482, in which the dean of St. Servatius confirmed a privilege of Pope John XXII of 1318, allowing the Crosiers to celebrate mass, collect money, etc. The papal tiara and Saint Peter's Keys of Heaven are clearly recognizable. Above and below are depictions of the coat of arms of the Crosiers and what looks like a sundial or an astrological chart. These may not be related to the central reliefs. The bottom drawing may be connected to prior Mathias Mijnecom who was known as "Astronomas" because of his knowledge of mathematics and astronomy.
Ledger stones.
Around ten ledger stones remain in the church, all of laypersons. For the burghers of Maastricht the Crosier Church obviously was a popular place to be buried. It is remarkable that no graves of friars or other clergy have survived. Burials of friars in the church are mentioned in the monastery archive. It is also known that the Jesuit preacher Hendrik Denijs was buried in the choir of the church in 1571, and that three years later the dean of St. Servatius', Nicolaas van der Straeten, was buried in the same grave. None of the remaining ledger stones are in their original location. Some were moved to the cloisters (see below); others were most likely destroyed in the 19th century.
Some ledger stones were used twice, as was the case with the damaged stone that originally covered the grave of "jonker" Gerard van der Marck and his wife in 1482. It was reused for Art Proenen and his wife in 1618. The ledger stone of Elisabeth and Vaes Nuellens from 1510 is decorated with the Lamb of God and the Four Evangelists' symbols in the corners. A large sculpted ledger stone was moved to one of the chapels during the early-20th-century restorations. The stone from 1605 once covered the grave of mayor and "schepen" Johan Sdrogen and his wife Verona Weertz. Against a wall in the south-east chapel stands a ledger stone of 1639 with the damaged coat of arms of Lysbeth Coenegracht, widow of Herman Jekermans. Leaning against the wall of the north aisle are three ledger stones that were moved here from elsewhere. They are visible only through the glass back wall in the toilets. The 16th-century stone of mayor Mathijs Nollens's family is very worn. Next to this is a 17th-century stone with the coats of arms of the families Meesters and Selen. The third stone along this wall also dates from the 17th century and was part of the grave of mayor Andries van Stockhem and his wife Catharine.
Monastery wings.
Outer walls.
The four wings of the monastery make the shape of an imperfect square between the streets Kruisherengang and Kommel. The north wing runs parallel to the south aisle of the church and for that reason is not visible from the street. The east wing overlooks Kommel, a street that at this point has the appearance of a square. In 2009 it was redesigned as a park with trees, box hedges, flower beds and cobbled paths. A bronze sculpture of a horse ("Julius Solway", Arthur Spronken, 1982) was relocated in front of the hotel, also in 2009. The south wing is visible only from a secluded garden between the monastery and a row of houses along Kommel. Both the south wing and the west wing end in a stepped gable.
The outer walls are largely built with local limestone ("mergel") with incidental use of brick, sometimes in alternating bands with limestone. The lower part of the west wing was replaced in 1928 by Nivelstein sandstone, which is harder. Pointed Gothic windows, partly dating from the 15th century, appear on the ground floor of the south and east wing, and in the stepped gables. Elsewhere 16th-century rectangular windows with stone frames and muntins and wooden window shutters predominate. The shutters, including those of the dormers with their tented roofs, are painted red and white, the colours of the Crosiers' cross. The entrances in the outer walls of the south and west wings have pediments with the Crosiers' cross. Above a door in the east wing is a lintel with the name of the agricultural testing station ("Rijkslandbouwproefstation") in blackletters.
Cloister yard.
The cloister yard is a quadrangle that is not entirely square, surrounded by four monastery wings. The lower Gothic windows on this side were probably once open; they were (re)glazed in the 19th century. Gothic windows also appear in the upper floor of the south wing; the lower windows in this wing are wider than elsewhere. Also, the south wing features a centrally-placed one-storey outbuilding with a hip roof that protrudes into the cloister yard. As is the case with the street-facing façades, brightly coloured window shutters decorate the Renaissance windows around the cloister yard.
The cloister yard may have been used originally as a herb garden ("hortus medicus"). It is now a hotel patio. The white pavement and the colour of the garden furniture, as well as the red and white window shutters, refer to the colours of the Crosiers' cross. A modern staircase leads to a fire escape tunnel that goes under the south wing of the cloisters, connecting the courtyard to the outside world. A light sculpture by Ingo Maurer in the shape of an illuminated vertical column filled with 3000 litres of water with silver dust has been temporarily removed because of malfunctioning.
Interior.
The monastery wings consist of a ground floor and two floors above, of which the upper floor is directly underneath the roof. Parts of the building are furnished with cellars that have barrel vaults. Surrounding the cloister yard are the cloister corridors. The leaded glass windows date from the late 19th century and were possibly designed in the studios of Pierre Cuypers in Roermond. The ceilings are supported by beams with profiled corbels, which are all painted white. The tiled floors were renewed in 2004. The north corridor is narrower because it is adjacent to the church. The other corridors provide access to rooms that have windows looking out onto the street. The protruding section of the south corridor contains a lavabo (including a hand pump until the late 20th century).
Several interesting ledger stones have been moved here, probably from the church. The floor of the lavabo space in the south corridor consists of a large ledger stone from the 17th century that once covered the grave of the Alards family. Another ledger stone has been placed against the north wall of the north corridor. It dates from 1624 when both Thomas Ulrich and his wife Anna were buried underneath it.
The public spaces and rooms of the Kruisherenhotel – fifty in the main building and ten in the Renaissance House and Casa Nova (see below) – were individually conceived by interior architect Henk Vos, who made use of furniture and lighting designs by Le Corbusier, Philip Starck, Marc Newson, Ingo Maurer and others.
Other buildings.
The Crosier Monastery in Maastricht is unique in the Netherlands as it has been preserved in its original state almost completely. Some minor parts have not survived. As late as 1962, a 17th-century gateway with the Crosiers' coat of arms was demolished. Along Kommel there are some small houses (all "Rijksmonuments") that may or may not have been part of the monastery. They are privately owned and not part of the hotel.
Adjacent to this row of houses are two buildings that are now part of the Kruisherenhotel. The 17th-century building on the south-west corner is known as "Renaissance House" (Kruisherengang nr. 23). It is a remnant of the original gatehouse and gatekeeper's lodge that stood here. There is some evidence on the north façade that this building was once bigger. The house is built in the local style of the Mosan Renaissance with alternating layers of brick and limestone, a stepped gable and bluestone door and window frames. A brand new pavilion clad in COR-TEN steel was added to the east of this in 2004. Between this "Casa Nova" and the south wing of the main monastery a patio garden has been laid out.
It is not clear whether anything remains of the tenant farms, tithe barns and other buildings that were once owned by the Maastricht Crosiers. In the small village of Herderen in Belgian Limburg, where the Crosiers owned several properties, a street is named after them, the Kruisherenstraat.
Other heritage.
Tabernacle tower.
A former eye-catcher in the Crosier Church must have been the imposing 16th-century tabernacle tower. It was around ten meters high and only fragments of it survived. It was sculpted in or shortly after 1561 by Liège sculptor Guillaume de Jonckeu. The contract for the work between De Jonckeu and prior Servaes Heynsberch still exists. According to this contract, the tabernacle was to follow the example of a similar one in St. John's Cathedral in 's-Hertogenbosch (destroyed during the "beeldenstorm" of 1568). De Jonckeu received 120 Brabant guilders for the work. The money was provided by the dean of St. Servatius, Nicolaas van der Straeten, who was buried in front of the tabernacle in 1573. During the restoration of the church in 1913 around 15 fragments of the tabernacle were discovered underneath the church floor. They are part of the collection of the LGOG Limburg Historical Society, now in storage at the Bonnefantenmuseum. Some of the fragments, described in detail by the art historian "jonkheer" Eugène van Nispen tot Sevenaer in 1926, may have gone missing.
With the help of the remaining fragments and the surviving contract, it is possible to make a fairly accurate reconstruction of the tabernacle tower. It was constructed of natural stone (Avesnes limestone?), 35 Liège feet tall (ca. 10 meters), and consisted of six or seven sections on top of each other. The pedestal was decorated with statues of the Seven Virtues. On top of this was the proper tabernacle which had three metal doors with statues of angels in between (one of the angels, 70 cm tall and standing in a niche, has been preserved). It could be reached via three steps of Namur bluestone. Above the tabernacle were three eucharist-themed reliefs: the Last Supper (seven fragments remaining), the manna rain in the desert, and the priesthood of Melchizedek. On top of this were statues of the four evangelists (of which Saint Luke survives), then statues of the four Doctors of the Church, and finally statues of two local holy bishops, Saint Servatius and Saint Lambert. The latter two sculptures were placed underneath a ciborium.
The style is that of the Northern Renaissance, of which Liège under prince-bishop Érard de La Marck had become a major centre. No other works by Guillaume de Jonckeu are known. The sculptures have a certain dynamic but lack detail. Some of the architectural parts are mindful of the work of Cornelis Floris de Vriendt, though less refined. Tabernacle towers with a similar architectural scheme can be found elsewhere in the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, as in St. Leonard's Church, Zoutleeuw.
Other artworks and liturgical objects.
As evidenced in the bookkeeping records of the monastery, the Maastricht woodcarver Jan van Steffeswert received several commissions from the Crosiers between 1512 and 1516. Among these were a statue of Saint Michael of 1512 and one of the Virgin Mary of 1515. It is unlikely that any of these still exist. In 1733 local artist Jean-Baptiste Coclers painted the four evangelists for the chancel in the Crosier Church. The whereabouts of these paintings are unknown.
A small sculpture that did survive is an heirloom from a previous occupier, the agricultural testing station. The wooden statuette of a Crosier used to be in the director's office but was given to the Kruisherenhotel when it opened in 2005. It now stands in a niche in the apse of the former church. A series of Renaissance corbels are also relatively late arrivals in the building. They are on loan from the Bonnefantenmuseum but their provenance is unknown. Some have the form of caryatids, others of lions or fantasy creatures that hold coats of arms. Since 2005 the corbels are on display in the stairwells and corridors in the hotel.
A fragment of the 15th-century choir stalls has been reused in the attic of a house adjacent to the monastery. The acquisition of various liturgical objects is listed in the Crosiers' archive, but only a few have survived. A precious monstrance and a chalice by the Maastricht silversmith Johannes Wery (1695-1750) must have once adorned the main altar in the Crosier Church. Both are now in the church treasury of Burtscheid Abbey (near Aachen).
Books and manuscripts.
Book covers and manuscripts were produced in the Crosier Monastery until the second half of the 16th century. The book covers were made of calf leather with embossed decorations of lions, flowers, leaves or lozenge shapes. Several carry an emblem: an angel holding the Crosiers' coat of arms. Famous copyists were Daniël van Keulen (ca. 1462-1489), Franciscus van Nijmegen (ca. 1493-1531) and Jasper Schaefdriess (ca. 1519-1569). The latter was asked to teach copyists in Liège in 1533. Theodoricus van Sittard and Johannes Leerdam were well-known bookbinders around 1500. Johannes Leerdam worked in Maastricht for about ten years, then moved to London towards the end of his life.
Few manuscripts produced in the Crosiers' scriptorium in Maastricht have survived. Four manuscripts from the 15th and 16th century are in the collection of the National Library of the Netherlands in The Hague ("Koninklijke Bibliotheek" or KB). Other collections with Maastricht Crosiers' manuscripts are: the University Library Groningen (UBG), the Utrecht University Library (UBU) and the Leiden University Library.
Starting in 1528, prior Jan Proenen kept meticulous records of the financial affairs of the monastery. He also recorded the books he purchased for the library. In 13 years he bought over 60 books, half of which were non-religious. In 1536 he bought a Latin dictionary in five languages by Ambrogio Calepino. By special order of the National Convention, it was confiscated by the French in January 1795. In February, the rest of the valuable books were confiscated and shipped to France. All of the books bought by Proenen went missing, except for one. His "Novus orbis regionum ac insularium veteribus incognitarum", published in Basel in 1532, purchased and annotated by Proenen in 1533, and bound in the Crosiers' own bookbindery, is now in the collection of the city library in Maastricht (Centre Céramique, CC).
Crosier archive.
The archive of the Crosier Monastery has been part of the Dutch National Archives ("Rijksarchief") since 1882. It is now stored in the Regionaal Historisch Centrum Limburg (RHCL), based in a former Minorite monastery in Maastricht. The Crosier archive measures 9.9 m and consists of 304 charters on parchment and 110 archival calendars, bundles and loose papers. it is considered special because of its completeness which is unique in this part of Europe. Almost the entire financial administration of the monastery from 1450 to 1795 has been preserved. It provides valuable information, not only about the monastery but about many aspects of life in Maastricht in general.
The oldest and most vulnerable documents are packed in Lexan (a polycarbonate) and stored in a secure and refrigerated strongroom. Around sixty documents precede the founding of the monastery. They are either related to the early history of the Crosier Order, or to transactions of real estate later acquired by the Crosiers. Three documents are of paramount importance for the history of the monastery: the original deed of 1436 in which five houses at Kommel where transferred to the Crosiers, the permission for the monastery foundation by the local clergy (1437), and the permission granted by the bishop of Liège (1438). In 2015 most of the Crosier archive was preserved and digitalised as a result of a national conservation programme ("Metamorfoze").
The original matrix of the seal of the Maastricht Crosiers dates from the 15th-century. After having been lost for decades, it was discovered by chance in 1876 and is now part of the RHCL archives. Its diameter is 3.5 cm. In the centre is a quatrefoil with the head of Christ crowned with thorns. The text around the quatrefoil is in Latin: "+ S: COVENTUS.FRM SACTE. CRUCIS. TRAICTENCIS".

Drumsagard Castle

Drumsagard Castle, near Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, was a motte and bailey castle which was then built of stone. The castle was the caput of the barony of Drumsagard. Drumsagard was held in the 13th century by the Oliphant family, before it passed by marriage to the de Moravia family. It passed to the Douglas family in 1370 by the marriage of Archibald Douglas, Earl of Douglas to Johanna, daughter of Thomas Moray of Bothwell. The Hamilton family were granted the lands in 1452.
Drumsagard was ruinous by 1796, and the stone used to build the nearby Hallside Farms. An eponymous housing development now surrounds the site of the castle.

2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships – Women's 1500 metres

The women's 1500 metres at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships took place on 2 and 3 March 2018.
Summary.
The final saw the return of several lead combatants from the 3000 metres two days earlier. Their strategies changed here. At the gun, world record holder Genzebe Dibaba started more aggressively, showing her intent to mark the leader, who turned out to be Beatrice Chepkoech. Returning champion, Sifan Hassan went to her familiar position at the back of the pack. After a lap of easy jogging, Rababe Arafi moved out to a faster pace, immediately marked by Dibaba. The additional speed quickly brought Hassan into a marking position on Chepkoech behind Dibaba, then Laura Muir squeezed through the inside to run behind Dibaba. After another lap, Dibaba tired of the gamesmanship and took the lead. Hassan, Muir, Chepkoech, Arafi and Winny Chebet formed a chase pack that separated from the rest of the field. Over two faster laps, Chepkoech moved past Hassan to mark Dibaba as the three broke away from the other three, with Muir looking like she was struggling to hold on to the back of the second group. But with three laps to go, Muir sprinted around the group and quickly bridged the gap back to lead group. Chepkoech struggled and fell off the back leaving a three woman breakaway, with Dibaba leading Hassan then Muir with two laps to go. The medalists were decided as the two Kenyan women faded in the rearview mirror. The positions remained the same until the final backstretch when Muir sprinted past Hassan as Dibaba pulled away. Dibaba continued to pull away to the finish, Muir separating from Hassan.

SS Princess Anne

The SS "Princess Anne" was a Virginia Ferry Company (VFC) steam ship that plied the route across Chesapeake Bay between Little Creek, near Norfolk, and Kiptopeke Beach, at the southern end of the Eastern Shore of Virginia. She was known for her streamlined superstructure designed by Raymond Loewy, which attracted the attention of the newsreels and the nautical press.
In 1993, she was sunk as an artificial reef and scuba diving site off the coast of West Palm Beach, Florida.
History.
The ship was designed by Raymond Loewy in 1933 for the Virginia Ferry Company, a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad for whom Loewy had done a great deal of design work. Using the hull of an older ferry from within the VFC's fleet as a basis, he created a streamlined superstructure that Christopher Innes has described as possibly influenced by Norman Bel Geddes' 1932 Streamlined Ocean Liner. The paintwork emphasized the sleek form with one unbroken line flowing from stem to stern.
The "Princess Anne" entered service on 9 July 1936, plying the route between Little Creek (then in Princess Anne County) and Kiptopeke Beach, Virginia, across the Chesapeake Bay, a distance of around 21 miles. "The Nautical Gazette" recorded the event under the headline "The Svelte "Princess Anne" Makes Her Debut", describing her as "ultra-modern". A Universal Newsreel showed her under way. In 1940, the "Keystone Motorist" described her, with the SS "Delmarva", as one of "two of the largest motor transports in the world".
The ferry service across the Chesapeake Bay ended after the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel opened in April 1964. Four of the seven ferries operated by the Virginia Ferry Company were acquired by the Delaware River and Bay Authority, including the "Princess Anne" which was renamed the SS "New Jersey" after which she traveled between Cape May, New Jersey and Lewes, Delaware. The ship was originally in length but on an unknown date she was cut in half and lengthened by the insertion of an additional hull section, giving her a new length of .
A set of black and white photographs from 1940 showing migrant workers waiting to board at the Little Creek end of the ferry and travelling on board is in the collection of the Library of Congress.
In 1993, she was sunk off the coast of West Palm Beach, Florida, as an artificial reef and scuba diving site. She sits at a depth of approximately 100 feet and can be located at 26° 47.60' North latitude and 80° 00.20' West longitude.

Giovanni Folci

Giovanni Folci (24 February 1890 - 31 March 1963) was an Italian Roman Catholic priest and the founder of the Sisters Handmaids of Jesus Crucified. Folci began his ecclesial studies after he turned ten and was called to serve as a chaplain to Italian soldiers on the frontlines during the course of World War I until his capture and release. His main priorities as a priest included tending to the ill and poor and also focused on the education of children while seeking to establish a religious congregation that would continue that work.
Folci's beatification process launched in 2003 and he became titled as a Servant of God as the investigation was opened in his native Como. The investigation culminated on 30 September 2015 after Pope Francis confirmed his life of heroic virtue and named him as Venerable.
Life.
Education and priesthood.
Giovanni Folci was born in Como on 24 February 1890 as one of four children to the devout Carlo Folci and Teresa Sonzini. His father was a store manager and also owned a tavern adjoining the store. He was baptized on 27 February in the San Michele parish church. His two brothers were Giuseppe and Giacomo and his sister was Carolina.
Folci began to serve as an altar server in 1897 and in the summer months lived with his maternal grandmother in Malnate where he also got to know his uncle (now a Servant of God) Carlo Sonzini who was a seminarian in Milan. The relationship he forged with his uncle fostered within Folci the call to enter the priesthood. His uncle soon suggested to his parents that he be sent to Vendrogno to complete his studies where his academic results were so good that he was permitted to skip the fifth grade. In summer 1901 he attended the ordination of his uncle and sometime after that towards summer's end arrived in Como to commence his own studies for the priesthood. But in 1904 he suffered from lung disease and was sent to Valduce to be treated. He returned to his studies once he recovered and passed his examinations in 1909.
He was made a deacon on 6 January 1913. Folci was ordained to the priesthood in Como on 13 July 1913 and he celebrated his first Mass on 14 July in the Santuario del Crocifisso in Como with his uncle at his side. On 20 July he celebrated Mass in his parish of origin in his hometown. In August 1913 the Bishop of Como appointed him as the parish priest for Valle di Colorina and sent him there instead of to upper Valmalenco as was predicted for him. He arrived with his mother for the first time in Valle di Colorina on 23 August with the stationmaster welcoming him at the station.
Chaplain and imprisonment.
But the outbreak of World War I in Europe saw him summoned to the frontlines that August as a chaplain in which he was later decorated for his actions. He was appointed as a chaplain for the soldiers at the end of September and served in that role until May 1916 when he was permitted a period of rest; he resumed his activities in October. Folci and several others were later taken as prisoners in November 1917 following the defeat of Caporetto and then interned in concentration camps across German regions until 1919 once the Red Cross arrived to oversee prisoner release following the war's end. It was during his time in prison that he tended to his fellow prisoners. He was first held in detention in Rastatt in Baden-Württemberg and received permission to celebrate Mass for himself and his fellow prisoners.
In September 1918 he was sent to a hospital near Limburg to tend to German soldiers and decided upon the armistice in 1918 not to leave the hospital. He left just over a month later in January 1919 and passed through Rome where he met with Pope Benedict XV who encouraged his idea to erect a monument to the fallen and victimized of the war.
Projects.
Upon his return to his parish in July 1919 he had the desire to commemorate the imprisoned and the fallen which his parishioners supported. To that end he decided to erect the Santuario del Prigioniero dedicated to the Blessed Sacrament in his parish to honor those fallen; this project was completed and was consecrated on 27 September 1925. In December 1925 he rested following a period of exhaustion. He later founded - next to that place - his religious congregation known as the Sisters Handmaids of Jesus Crucified on 29 November 1926 alongside several religious and priests. This order took several forms during his lifetime. In 1919 he founded a center for the education of children and at a later stage founded the Et in Terra Pax home for retreats for priests and others.
He later bought at Santa Caterina di Valfurva an old hotel which he converted into a Casa Alpina for pre-seminarians and another at Villa di Santa Croce in Como which also acted as a retirement home for older priests. In 1950 he opened a home for the Spiritual Exercises and the Casa Gesù for the care of ill priests in Loano. It was also in 1950 that he travelled to Rome to celebrate the proclamation of the dogma of the Assumption of the Mother of God. Folci was successful in 1956 with the establishment of the San Pio X Pre-Seminario within the Vatican state which received approval from Pope Pius XII and was a venture that Monsignor Domenico Tardini also supported. Federico Tedeschini - the archpriest for the Vatican - also agreed with Folci's proposal. He and the students of the San Pio X Pre-Seminario met with Pius XII in Castel Gandolfo on 2 October 1952.
He was present on 5 February 1957 at the bedside of his uncle (who was made a Monsignor in 1942) who died not long after Folci arrived. On 23 February 1960 he was appointed as the rector for the Santuario della Madonna del Soccorso in Ossuccio and was hospitalized in Milan in 1960 after suffering heart problems while in Albenga.
Death.
On 30 March 1963 he returned from Loano to his parish after having passed through Como. He was found dead on the floor in his room on 31 March after the religious of his order waited for his presence to celebrate Mass. Folci's remains are interred (since October 1963) in the Santuario di Valle di Colorina in the main chapel beneath the main altar. His resting place is marked with a bronze monument that depicts a priest rendering assistance to a soldier.
Beatification process.
The beatification process launched on 7 July 2003 under Pope John Paul II and he was titled as a Servant of God after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints published the "nihil obstat" (no objections) decree that would allow for the cause's launch. The Bishop of Como inaugurated the diocesan investigation for the cause on 15 September 2004 and closed it in Como on 19 November 2005; the C.C.S. validated this process in Rome on 24 February 2007.
The postulation then drafted and compiled the Positio dossier that collated witness testimonies and gathered documentation accumulated from the diocesan process; this dossier was submitted to the C.C.S. on 16 February 2013. The dossier received approval from theologians on 3 June 2014 and from the C.C.S. members on 22 September 2015. He was declared to be Venerable the following 30 September after Pope Francis confirmed his life of heroic virtue.
The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Francesca Consolini.

The men's 3000 metres at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships took place on 2 and 4 March 2018.
Summary.
With more lane violations being called even as they would be less significant in a race of this distance, four were disqualified in the heats, most notably Olympic silver medalist Paul Chelimo, jostled into taking one step inside the rail.
The final began at a jog, with first Yassin Bouih stepping out to the lead, then Clemens Bleistein to lead the race through at 1:14.58 first 400. The three Ethiopian runners all went to the back of the pack. Davis Kiplangat moved to the front but didn't really push the pace. After another lap, Adel Mechaal took the point, the next 400 accomplished even slower in at 1:15.12. Mechaal took the field through another slightly faster 400 in 1:12.12 as the Ethiopians at the back began to get impatient. Hagos Gebrhiwet began to move forward in the pack, then Yomif Kejelcha joined him. Towards the end of the next 400, Selemon Barega made a big move to sweep toward the front. With the acceleration, the Kenyans and ex-pat Shadrack Kipchirchir moved forward, Kejelcha taking over the lead. Mechaal came back to re-join the mix, then Barega made a big move to reach Kejelcha's shoulder, an Ethiopian wall at the front. Gebrhiwet then came forward on the outside, closing the box on the pursuers Kipchirchir and exchanging elbows with Mechaal. Gebrhiwet continued to move forward to second position. The three Ethiopians continued to accelerate, their strategic box broken into a line at the front. Free to move, Bethwell Birgen ran past Barega at the bell while Kejelcha was breaking free off the front. Down the final backstretch Birgen passed the fading Gebrhiwet. As Kejelcha extended his lead on to victory, Barega passed Gebrhiwet on the final turn, then launched his final sprint past a struggling Birgen who barely held off a resurgent Gebrhiwet and Mechaal for bronze.

Józef Schreier

Józef Schreier (; 18 February 1909, Drohobycz, Austria-Hungary – April 1943, Drohobycz, Occupied Poland) was a Polish mathematician of Jewish origin, known for his work in functional analysis, group theory and combinatorics. He was a member of the Lwów School of Mathematics and a victim of the Holocaust.
Józef Schreier was born on 18 February 1909 in Drohobycz. His father was a rabbi and doctor of philosophy. His cousin was the musician Alfred Schreyer. From 1927-31 he studied at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lwów.
In his first published paper, he defined what later came to be known as Schreier sets in order to show that not all Banach spaces possess the weak Banach-Saks property, disproving a conjecture of Stefan Banach and Stanisław Saks. Schreier sets were later discovered independently by researchers in Ramsey theory.
Schreier completed his master's degree "On tournament elimination systems" in 1932 under the direction of Hugo Steinhaus. Schreier correctly conjectured that to determine the second largest number in an unordered list requires at least formula_1 comparisons. In 1934, he completed his doctorate, "On finite base in topological groups" under Banach.
In 1932 he married Zofia Rosenblatt. Schreier often played blindfold chess.
He was a friend of Stanisław Ulam and co-authored eight papers with him. They were the only two undergraduates who attended the meetings at the Scottish Café in Lwów. (Schreier contributed ten questions to the Scottish Book.) Together they proved the Baire–Schreier–Ulam theorem and Schreier–Ulam theorem.
According to Ulam,
With the outbreak of World War II, Eastern Poland including Drohobycz was occupied by the USSR in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. After Operation Barbarossa, this territory was invaded by Nazi Germany. The Jews of Drohobycz were confined to the Drohobycz Ghetto. In April 1943, the Germans discovered—or were informed of—an underground bunker in which Schreier was hiding with other Jews. It took three days for them to force their way in. Schreier committed suicide by cyanide rather than be captured. Of a prewar Jewish population of 10,000 in Drohobycz, approximately 400 survived the war. Schreier's wife was one of them and later moved to Israel, where she remarried.

Summary.
Kendra Harrison came into these championships as the favorite based on her outdoor world record, but so far world championship medals have evaded her. She dominated her way through the rounds.
In the final, Christina Manning got the best start along with Devynne Charlton, but Harrison quickly made up ground. By the second hurdle, she had a foot (30 cm) lead, over the two, with Charlton fading from contention after that, while Sharika Nelvis and Isabelle Pedersen were the next back by the third hurdle. Nadine Visser pulled even with Pedersen still 2 feet behind Nelvis. Out front, Harrison had a metre lead over Manning. On the run in, Harrison and Manning retained their positions, while Visser closed quickly to take bronze from Nelvis. Seventh over the last barrier, Cindy Roleder also closed quickly to almost catch Nelvis for fourth. Harrison's winning time of 7.70 was a new Championship record.

Sunayani Devi

Sunayani Devi () (18 June 1875 – 23 February 1962) was an Indian painter born into the aristocratic Tagore family in Calcutta, West Bengal. She was a self taught artist, with no academic training in art. Inspired by her brothers, Abanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, and Samarendranath Tagore, she started painting only at the age of 30. She was married at the age of 12 to the grandson of Raja Ram Mohan Roy.
Early life.
Sunayani Devi was born on 18 June 1875 in the historically influential Tagore family in Calcutta to Gunendranath Thakur and Soudamini Devi. She was married at the age of 12 to Rajanimohan Chattopadhyaya. According to the writer, Partha Mitter, she never had formal training in art other than the art and music lessons as feminine accomplishments.
Painting style and themes.
Known to be a true primitive of the Bengal Art School, she drew inspiration from the Pata folk painting style which was familiar to the women of the Tagore household, often depicting scenes from Indian epics and mythologies in her works. Some of her notable works are "Sadhika", "Ardhanarisvar", "Satir Dehatyag", "Milk Maids" and "Yashoda and Krishna". According to Stella Kramrisch, she was the first modern painter in India. Her works were exhibited in 1922 as part of the Bauhaus artists' exhibition in Calcutta. Since the beginning, her works have been original and bold. They resemble the ancient Jain manuscript paintings. She applied wash technique to its fullest and later her works echoed the native imagery like village clay dolls that would be used as ornamentation. Her works are an amalgamation of modernist dialogue of primitive simplicity and a larger national discourse of being rooted in its cultural identity, thus carving her image as a nationalist artist. Critical analyses of her portraits, have led her to be addressed as a naïve painter, who used folk themes with allure and sensitivity.
Exhibitions.
Among Devi's exhibitions are:

Chantal Montellier

Chantal Montellier, born on August 1, 1947, in Bouthéon near Saint-Étienne in the Loire Department, is a French comics creator and artist, editorial cartoonist, novelist, and painter. As the first female editorial cartoonist in France, she is noted for pioneering women's involvement in comic books.
Biography.
Chantal Montellier studied at the École Supérieure d'Art et Design Saint-Étienne from 1962 to 1969. From 1969 to 1973, she was a professor of visual arts in colleges and high schools. From 1989 to 1993, she taught courses at Paris 8 University. Starting in 1972, she worked as an editorial cartoonist for "Combat syndicaliste", "Politis", "Maintenant", "L'Humanité", "L'Autre Journal", "Marianne", "France nouvelle", and "Révolution", among others, at a time when she was the only woman exercising her talents in the male-dominated field of work. As a comics creator, she contributed notably at "Charlie Mensuel", "Métal Hurlant", "", "(À suivre)", and "Psikopat".
Her realistic drawing, often in black and white early on, recalls that of Jacques Tardi, José Muñoz, or even Guido Crepax. She integrated many "modernist" graphic experiments (like ) before settling on her own profoundly original aesthetic.
Montellier began publishing comic strips such as "Andy Gang" in "Charlie Mensuel" in 1974 and in the French feminist comics magazine "Ah! Nana" in 1976. Her dystopian strip "1996", originally appearing in "Métal Hurlant," was reprinted in "Heavy Metal" in the United States in the late 1970s, bringing her work to the notice of Anglophone readers.
Chantal Montellier is one of the rare comic strip creators to have affirmed (and continues to affirm) her political and feminist engagement. For example, in "Les Damnés de Nanterre", an investigative comic strip about Florence Rey, she takes apart the official version of the shootout at the Place de la Nation, which set the police against an anarchist group. She came to suffer consequences for it: when she was first invited to Lausanne, for the 2007 , her appearance was canceled on the pretext that her presence might bother the other authors there.
Among her projects is her personal web site where, since 2007, her autobiographical account "De l'art et des cochons" (Of Art and Pigs) prominently features her comics universe (its actresses and actors, publishers, etc.) and an album of comics that she describes, inside quotation marks, as "erotic."
In 2007 she co-founded, with Jeanne Puchol, the , named for Artemisia Gentileschi, a prize annually awarded to comics created by one or more women.
In 2017, she brought out a new, completely revised edition of "Shelter Market" published by Les Impressions Nouvelles and a novel inspired by her own life, "Les vies et les morts de Cléo Stirner", in the literature collection of Éditions Goater.
Political engagement.
In 2012, Montellier supported Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the Left Party candidate in the presidential election.

2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships – Women's pentathlon

The women's pentathlon at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships took place on 2 March 2018.
Summary.
No podium athletes returned from the previous championships, nor the 2017 World Championships or Olympics. The top returnee was sixth place Kendell Williams, while Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Yorgelis Rodríguez just missed the medals at the World Championships less than six months earlier.
Williams and her American teammate Erica Bougard dominated the first event, running the 60 meters hurdles in 8.08 and 8.07, respectively. Johnson-Thompson and Rodríguez came forward in the high jump clearing and 1.88m respectively. Johnson-Thompson took a 13 point lead over Bougard. Antoinette Nana Djimou had the best shot put by more than a metre over any of the leaders, 3 metres over Bougard, Williams and almost as much for Johnson-Thompson. Rodríguez took over the lead by 13 points over Johnson-Thompson, while Ivona Dadic moved into third just a point behind Johnson-Thompson. Back to another Johnson-Thompson specialty event, she long jumped to put 10 cm on Dadic and 35 cm on Rodríguez. A 2 cm superior jump by Eliška Klučinová was enough to displace Bougard from fourth place, both more than 100 points out of second place, still almost 40 points behind Rodríguez in third. In the final event, the 800 meters, Johnson-Thompson left no doubt, winning the race outright. More than a second behind her, Rodríguez did beat Dadic, but only by .12, not nearly enough to make up the 65 point deficit.

Mithu Sen

Mithu Sen is an Indian conceptual artist. Born in West Bengal in 1971.
Early life &amp; education.
Sen was born in 1971 in West Bengal and obtained Bachelor's and Master's degrees in painting from Kala Bhavan at Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan, West Bengal. Later, she completed a post-graduate program (visiting) at the Glasgow School of Art in the United Kingdom on the Charles Wallace India Trust Award for 2000–2001.
Sen's Bengali poetry has been published in collected volumes, as well as in magazines and journals since she was a young adult.
Work.
Sen’s conceptual practice with a varied set of surfaces, materials, and processes that emerge in the wake of her regular negotiations with her milieu. Her work often deals with the complexities of the body in its physical, basal, erotic and sexless forms. A lot of her works deal with the self as a matrix of identities and myths – questioning societal norms, fixed beliefs, and categorisations.
Sen's material art work, which she calls “byproducts” of her larger process, contrast scale, imagery and genre to problematize existing notions of hospitality, sexuality, communication, and contract. Known for her often erotically and emotionally charged imagery, Sen’s work blurs the line between distance and intimacy, often explored through what she calls “radical hospitality”.
Using the virtual and the real forms of social relation and individual experience, both spontaneous and premeditated, Sen creates work fundamentally as a performer. Many of her performance-based works challenge the notion of language as a proprietary means of communication, attempting to outsmart linguistic hegemonies and codes of propriety by creating an abstract body of gibberish text she calls “non-language”. Non-language, whose use creates moments of what Sen calls “lingual anarchy” employs glitch, noise, sonic affect in its spontaneous creation. Before turning to the aporias of non-communicative language, Sen was a practicing poet in Bengali.
Sen’s recent works extend from the promise of language and community to the legality of contract, opening up questions caught between law and living.
Career and exhibitions.
Sen was the first artist to be awarded The Skoda Prize in 2010 for Indian contemporary art. In 2015, she also won the Prudential Eye Award for the Best Emerging Artist Using Drawing.
Her selected exhibitions and projects include:
Personal life.
Sen lives and works in New Delhi. She is an enthusiastic traveller.

2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships – Men's heptathlon

The men's heptathlon at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships took place on 2 and 3 March 2018.
Summary.
With the retirement of defending champion Ashton Eaton, the multi event world opened up. 2016 Olympic silver medalist Kévin Mayer assumed the top spot winning the 2017 World Championships. His pursuers included Olympic bronze medalist Damian Warner and world championship bronze medalist Kai Kazmirek.
In the 60 metres, Warner ran the top time of 6.74, his personal best, but Mayer was only .11 behind, also running his personal best, putting Warner 41 points ahead. In the long jump, Kazmirek boomed a personal best to offset one of the poorer 60 metre times to move into a tight group fighting for third place. Oleksiy Kasyanov actually held an 8 point advantage in third, with Dominik Distelberger joining the other two within 13 points of each other. At the top of the leader board, Mayer had another personal best of 7.55m in the long jump to pull within two points of Warner. In the shot put, Mayer overpowered Warner, his more than 2 feet further than Warner, who threw his personal best 14.90m. Mayer had a 45 point lead. Kazmirek's personal best 14.55m shot put put him 16 points up for third place. As the last event of the first day, Mayer and Warner topped out at 2.02m, with Kazmirek gaining a little ground with a 2.05m. At that height, Maicel Uibo had barely warmed up. Uibo kept clearing heights all the way up to , which also moved him into a solid third place, exactly 100 points behind Mayer.
Warner began the second day with a 7.67 60 metres hurdles, .16 better than Mayer and enough to pull him back to 4 points behind. Both Kazmirek and Uibo ran personal bests, but Kazmirek was .24 better to give him a 45 point advantage. Kasyanov pushed over a hurdle to take himself out of the race. In the pole vault, Warner got over a personal best 4.90m to only lose 10 cm and another 30 points to Mayer. Again on the vertical jump, Uibo excelled clearing a personal best of , which was matched by Eelco Sintnicolaas who was still in sixth place, behind Zachery Ziemek. But Kazmirek had also jumped a personal best 5.20m, so Uibo was still 13 points behind. In order to win the championship, Warner needed to beat Mayer by about 3 seconds in the 1000 meters, and Uibo needed to beat Kazmirek by about 1.3 seconds. Both Warner 2:37.12 and Uibo 2:38.51 ran personal bests in first and second place. Mayer was able to stay about 2 and a half seconds behind Warner to take the championship by a scant 5 points. Uibo beat Kazmirek by over 3 and a half seconds to take the bronze. Warner was able to beat Mike Smith's 25 year old Canadian national record.

French Restoration style

The French Restoration style was predominantly Neoclassicism, though it also showed the beginnings of romanticism in music and literature. The term describes the arts, architecture, and decorative arts of the Bourbon Restoration period (1814–1830), during the reign of Louis XVIII and Charles X from the fall of Napoleon to the July Revolution of 1830 and the beginning of the reign of Louis-Philippe.
Architecture and design.
Public buildings and monuments.
To commemorate the memory of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette and to expiate the crime of their execution, King Louis XVIII built the Chapelle expiatoire by Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine on the site of the small cemetery of the Madeleine, where their remains (now in the Basilica of Saint-Denis) had been hastily buried following their execution. It was completed and dedicated in 1826.
The royal government restored the symbols of the old regime, but continued the construction of most of the monuments and urban projects begun by Napoleon. The church of La Madeleine, begun under Louis XVI, had been turned by Napoleon into the Temple of Glory (1807). It was now turned back to its original purpose, as the Royal church of La Madeleine. All of the public buildings and churches of the Restoration were built in a relentlessly neoclassical style. Work resumed, slowly, on the unfinished Arc de Triomphe, begun by Napoleon. At the end of the reign of Louis XVIII, the government decided to transform it from a monument to the victories of Napoleon into a monument celebrating the victory of the Duke of Angôuleme over the Spanish revolutionaries who had overthrown their Bourbon king. A new inscription was planned: "To the Army of the Pyrenees" but the inscription had not been carved and the work was still not finished when the regime was toppled in 1830. 
The Canal Saint-Martin was finished in 1822, and the building of the Bourse de Paris, or stock market, designed and begun by Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart from 1808 to 1813, was modified and completed by Éloi Labarre in 1826. New storehouses for grain near the Arsenal, new slaughterhouses, and new markets were finished. Three new suspension bridges were built over the Seine; the Pont d'Archeveché, the Pont des Invalides and footbridge of the Grève. All three were rebuilt later in the century.
Religious architecture.
Several new churches were begun during the Restoration to replace those destroyed during the Revolution. A battle took place between architects who wanted a neogothic style, modeled after Notre-Dame, or the neoclassical style, modeled after the basilicas of ancient Rome. The battle was won by a majority of neoclassicists on the Commission of Public Buildings, who dominated until 1850. Jean Chalgrin had designed Saint-Philippe de Role before the Revolution in a neoclassical style; it was completed (1823–30) by Étienne-Hippolyte Godde. Godde also completed Chalgrin's project for Saint-Pierre-du-Gros-Caillou {1822–29), and built the neoclassic basilicas of Notre-Dame-du-Bonne Nouvelle ((1823–30) and Saint-Denys-du-Saint-Sacrament (1826–35). Other notable neoclassical architects of the Restoration included Louis-Hippolyte Lebas, who built Notre-Dame-de-Lorette (1823–36); (1823–30); and Jacques Ignace Hittorff, who built the church of Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul (1824–44). Hittorff went on to along a brilliant career in the reigns of Louis Philippe and Napoleon III, designing the new plan of the Place de la Concorde and constructing the Gare du Nord railway station (1861–66). 
Commercial architecture - the shopping gallery.
A new form of commercial architecture had appeared at the end of the 18th century; the passage, or shopping gallery, a row of shops along a narrow street covered by a glass roof. They were made possible by improved technologies of glass and cast iron, and were popular since few Paris streets had sidewalks and pedestrians had to compete with wagons, carts, animals and crowds of people. The first indoor shopping gallery in Paris had opened at the Palais-Royal in 1786; rows of shops, along with cafes and the first restaurants, were located under the arcade around the garden. It was followed by the passage Feydau in 1790–91, the passage du Caire in 1799, and the Passage des Panoramas in 1800. In 1834 the architect Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine carried the idea a step further, covering an entire courtyard of the Palais-Royal, the Galerie d'Orleans, with a glass skylight. The gallery remained covered until 1935. It was the ancestor of the glass skylights of the Paris department stores of the later 19th century. 
Residential architecture.
During the Restoration, and particularly after the coronation of King Charles X in 1824. New residential neighborhoods were built on the Right Bank in Paris, as the city grew to the north and west. Between 1824 and 1826, a time of economic prosperity, the quarters of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Europe, Beaugrenelle and Passy were all laid out and construction began. The width of lots grew larger; from six to eight meters wide for a single house to between twelve and twenty meters for a residential building. The typical new residential building was four to five stories high, with an attic roof sloping forty-five degrees, broken by five to seven windows. The decoration was largely adapted from that of the Rue de Rivoli; horizontal rather than vertical orders, and simpler decoration. The windows were larger and occupied a larger portion of the façades. Decoration was provided by ornamental iron shutters and then wrought-iron balconies. Variations of this model were the standard on Paris boulevards until the Second Empire.
The hôtel particular, or large private house of the Restoration, usually was built in a neoclassical style, based on Greek architecture or the style of Palladio, particularly in the new residential quarters of Nouvelle Athenes and the Square d'Orleans on Rue Taibout (9th arrondissement), a private residential square (1829–35) in the English neoclassical style designed by Edward Cresy. Residents of the square included George Sand and Frédéric Chopin. Some of the houses in the new quarters in the 8th arrondissement, particularly the quarter of François I, begun in 1822, were made in a more picturesque style, a combination of the Renaissance and classical style, called the "Troubadour" style. This marked the beginning of the movement away from uniform neoclassicism toward eclectic residential architecture.
Interior Design and Furniture.
The decorative style of the French Restoration borrowed from both the geometry of the neoclassical style era, and the overload of decoration of the Louis XIV style, along with the color of Renaissance. One of the best examples is the Charles X museum within the Louvre, a suite of rooms that was created for, among other purposes, the Salon of artists that was held there annually. The ceilings were divided into compartments filled with paintings and lavishly decorated with corniches, columns and pilasters. The neo-Gothic also began to appear in interior decoration during the 1820, particularly in the design of galleries and salons with arches and arched windows and rose windows modeled after those in gothic cathedrals. Another feature of the French restoration was polychromy, the use of bright colors in the decorations, either with colored stone, glass, or paintings. Ceilings were particularly lavish, with hemicycles, cupolas, pendants, and vaults, often filled with decorative paintings. 
Another good example of the French Restoration style of design is the interior of the Chapelle expiatoire. While the layout of the building and architecture is sober and perfectly Greco-Roman neoclassicism, the inside of the dome is decorated with rosettes, and there is an abundance of high-relief sculpted decoration in bands below the cornices and between the columns supporting the dome, including stylized Maltese crosses, fleur-de-lis and roses. The floor also has elaborate polychrome decoration in stone with the same motifs. 
With the downfall of Napoleon, those aristocrats who had fled France during the Revolution began to return; they found their furniture had largely been confiscated and sold during the Revolution, and they had little money to buy lavish new furniture. The new King, Louis XVIII, liked the Empire style, so that style remained in place, with slightly rounded lines, and the removal of the Napoleonic symbols and ornaments, After the death of Louis XVIII in 1824, the new King, his brother Charles X, allotted an indemnity to aristocrats whose belongings had been confiscated during the Revolution, and the luxury furniture industry began to revive. Interest began to develop in older styles, particularly Gothic and Renaissance, especially after the creation of a museum of French monuments during the Revolution, but the gothic revival movement did not become really strong until after the publication in 1831 of "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" by Victor Hugo (1831).
Ornament of gilded bronze became rarer; most ornament was marquetry inlay, either light wood into dark, or dark wood into light; often in form of very elaborate floral designs, under the influence of the Duchesse de Berry. Under Charles X, the "á la Cathédral" or Cathedral chair became popular, with a back resembling the form of a Gothic stained glass window. The Gothic rose also became a popular decoration on furniture, along with stylized palmettes and other floral designs. Comfort was another consideration in the design of new chairs. The Voltaire armchair, with sabre-curved front legs, a high curving padded back and padded armrests, became popular. It took its name from a popular illustration of portrait of Voltaire, made about 1820, which showed him seated in s similar armchair.
Painting.
The Restoration saw the beginning of the long battle between neoclassicism and romanticism in painting and other domains of art. Jacques-Louis David, the dominant neoclassical painter during the reign of Napoleon, went into exile in Belgium; however, other prominent students of David remained in Paris, and continued the style, simply changing the subject matter. They included François Gérard, who painted the coronation of King Charles X in 1827, following almost exactly the composition used by David in his coronation painting of the Emperor Napoleon. Other former pupils of David included Antoine-Jean Gros (1771-1835), and the most prominent of all, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, (1780-1867), who painted his famous "Grand Odalisque" in the year that Napoleon first went into exile.
The new generation of neoclassicists, led by Ingres and Gérard, largely ignored the idea of a classicism based on Ancient Roman and Greek values, and concentrated instead on the perfection of the depiction of human body, by its lines, composition and color. During the Restoration, Ingres was commissioned to paint a mural for the ceiling of the Salle Clarac of the Louvre, called "Apothéose de Homer". Completed in 1827, it brought together all of the famous artists of history, attending the crowning of Homer by an angel. Ingres also surpassed all of his contemporaries of the period as a portrait painter. In 1819 Ingres painted "Roger rescuing Angelique", inspired by St. George slaying a dragon, in an almost surrealistic setting. Here Ingres' style foreshadowed the drama of Gustave Moreau Other painters who often followed the more delicate and sensual version of neoclassicism included Pierre-Paul Prud'hon (1758–1821), and the portraitist Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun.
An entirely different approach to painting was taken by Jean Louis Théodore Géricault with his painting "The Raft of the Meduse" (1818–1819), depicting the true story of the survivors of a shipwreck, gathered on a raft, appealing for help to a far distant ship. Géricault had meticulously studied anatomy to make the dead bodies on the raft more realistic. The painting was bitterly attacked by many critics and defended by many others, including the poet Baudelaire and the painter Horace Vernet. Géricault returned to the theme in 1821-24, with "The Tempest" or "The shipwreck" a painting of a corpse washed ashore on beach during storm. (1821–24), illustrating graphically again how humans were powerless against nature. In 1822–23, Gericault painted "La Folle", a portrait of a madwoman in a Paris asylum with a distant, hopeless stare. His school of painting became known a "theatrical romanticism".
Eugène Delacroix was another major painter of "theatrical romanticism" who emerged during the Restoration. As a young painter, he was particularly impressed by the works of Rubens in the Louvre, by the drawings of Goya, and the paintings of Constable. After traveling to England, where he met Constable, he returned to Paris and became friends with Stendhal, Balzac and Victor Hugo. At the Paris Salon of 1827, he showed nine paintings. The following year, he presented "The Death of Sardanapale". In the fall of 1830, shortly after the July Revolution, which toppled King Charles X, he painted "Liberty Leading the People", which was presented at the 1831 Salon, and became one of the icons of French art.
Sculpture.
The most prominent French sculptor of the Restoration was François Joseph Bosio (1768-1845). Born in Monaco, he received a scholarship from the Prince of Monaco to study in Paris, under Augustin Pajou. During the Empire of Napoleon, he sculpted some of the plaques on the column in Place Vendôme, and made numerous portrait busts of the Emperor's family. During the restoration, he became the royal sculptor to the King, and made both portrait busts and sculptors in the classical-romantic style. He made the central statue Louis XVI for the Expiatory Chapel, called "Apotheosis of Louis XVI" or "Louis XVI called to immortality, supported by an angel". In 1828 he completed a new work of sculpture for the top of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel at the Louvre. A chariot and horse sculpture, taken by Napoleon from St Mark's Basilica in Venice, had originally been placed atop the arch, but it had been returned to Venice after Napoleon's downfall. The Bourbons commissioned Bosio to make a new work, Peace guiding a Chariot, to commemorate the Bourbon Restoration. Bosio was also commissioned to replace the equestrian statue of Louis XIV which had been the centerpiece of Place des Victoires, which had been destroyed during the Revolution. His new version, twelve meters high, was installed in 1828.
Another notable French sculptor of the period was Pierre Jean David 1788–1856), who called himself David d'Angers, to distinguish himself from his teacher, Jacques Louis David. He worked in the studio of Jacques Louis David beginning in 1809. Then, between 1811 and 1816 he studied at the French Academy in Rome, where he became familiar with the works of Canova, the great Italian master of romanticism. However, he turned his own work toward classicism, illustrating the patriotic and moral virtues. He made busts or statues of many notable statesmen, including the Marquis de Lafayette, Thomas Jefferson and Goethe. In 1830, he began working on his best-known work, the frieze over the entrance of the Pantheon, titled "The Country recognizes its great men", which he completed in 1837. 
Another notable sculptor who began his career during the Restoration was François Rude, (1784–1847), He moved to Paris from Dijon in 1805 to study with Pierre Cartellier. In 1811 he won the Prix de Rome, but he was a confirmed Bonapartist, and after the downfall of Napoleon, he went into exile in Belgium, where he had success as a portrait sculptor. He did not return until 1827. Between 1833 and 1836, he made the celebrated sculptures, called "Les Marseillaise", which decorate the Arc de Triomphe.
Literature and theater.
The Bourbon restoration saw the rise of romanticism to the position of the dominant movement in French literature. The earliest prominent romantic was François-René de Chateaubriand, an essayist and diplomat. He began the Restoration as a committed defender of the Catholic faith and royalist, but gradually moved into the liberal opposition and became a fervent supporter of freedom of speech. Other prominent romantic writers of the period included the poet and politician Alphonse de Lamartine, Gérard de Nerval, Alfred de Musset, Théophile Gautier, and Prosper Mérimée.
Despite limitations on press freedom, Paris editors published the first works of some of France's most famous writers. Honoré de Balzac moved to Paris in 1814, studied at the University of Paris, wrote his first play in 1820, and published his first novel, "Les Chouans", in 1829. Alexandre Dumas moved to Paris in 1822, and found a position working for the future King, Louis-Philippe, at the Palais-Royal. In 1829, At the age of 27, he published his first play, "Henri III and his Courts". Stendhal, a pioneer of literary realism, published his first novel, "The Red and the Black", in 1830.
The young Victor Hugo declared that he wanted to be "Chateaubriand or nothing". His first book of poems, published in 1822 when he was twenty years old, earned him a royal prize from Louis XVIII. His second book of poems in 1826 established him as one of France's leading poets. He wrote his first plays, "Cromwell" and "Hernani" in 1827 and 1830, and his first short novel, "The Last Days of a Condemned Man", in 1829. The premiere of the ultra-romantic play "Hernani" caused a riot in the audience, on the eve of the fall of the Bourbon Monarchy,
Music.
The restoration of the monarchy with the coronation of Louis XVIII brought an end to the era of gigantic outdoor celebrations with patriotic music of the Revolution and the Empire of Napoleon. Instead, music returned to the salons of the old aristocracy, who returned from exile, and the new aristocracy created under Napoleon Bonaparte. The Music Conservatory in Paris was renamed the Royal School of Music, and the King commissioned the Italian-born Luigi Cherubini, newly named music director of the chapel of the Tuileries Palace, to write a requiem mass for Louis XVI, as well as a coronation mass for himself. The composer Gaspare Spontini was named director of royal music. A royal institution of religious music was also established in 1825, to perform early masterpieces of French religious music by Clément Janequin and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, which had been banned during the Revolution and ignored under Napoleon I. 
The composers most performed in the part of the period were the work of composers of the pre-revolutionary period, Gluck, Sacchini and Spontini, but new composers soon appeared, including Carl Maria von Weber, who arrived from Germany, and staged a highly-successful French version of the first romantic German opera, "Der Freischütz", or "The Marksman", in 1824.
The most successful musical theater of the period was the Théâtre-Italien, which performed in the Salle Favert in Paris; it produced the a series of operas by the most famous composer of the period, Gioachino Rossini, including "The Barber of Seville" in 1819. Rossini moved to Paris in 1824, and was named Director of Music and Staging at the Théâtre-Italien. Only Italian works were presented, always in Italian. Rossini became the most prominent figure of the Paris musical world, writing the music for the coronation of Charles X in 1824.
In 1820 a Bonapartist assassinated the Duke du Berry at the Paris opera house on rue de Richelieu. King Louis XVIII ordered the immediate closing, and then the demolition, of the Opera House. The Opera moved to the Salle Le Peletier, where it remained for fifty years. This theater was the scene of the birth of the first French grand opera, and the first romantic opera, with the premier of "La Muette de Portici" by Auber in July 1829. The theme of this opera, the rebellion of the people of Naples against Spanish rule, was particularly romantic and revolutionary. A performance of the opera in Brussels in 1830 led to riots, followed by a real revolution. Wagner attended a performance and wrote, "it was something entirely new; no one had seen a subject of an opera so current; it was the first true musical drama in five acts entirely provided with all the elements of tragedy, and notable also for its tragic ending."
The Paris opera continued to astonish its audiences with new musical and visual effects. For the opera "The Last Days of Pompeii" by Giovanni Pacini, the opera employed the scientist and inventor Louis Daguerre to create optical illusions on a screen simulating dancing flames and the waves of the sea.
To satisfy the demands of Paris opera-goers for truly grand opera, Rossini was commissioned to write the Le siège de Corinthe and then "William Tell". This last work, which premiered at the Pelletier opera house on August 3, 1829, despite its famed overture, disappointed the critics, who criticized its excessive length, weak story, and lack of action. The criticism stung Rossini, and, at the age of thirty-seven, he retired from writing operas.
The musical salons of the aristocracy had a working-class counterpart in Paris during the Restoration; the "goguette", musical clubs formed by Paris workers, craftsmen, and employees. There were "goguettes" of both men and women. They usually met once a week, often in the back room of a cabaret, where they would enthusiastically sing popular, comic, and sentimental songs. During the Restoration, songs were also an important form of political expression. The poet and songwriter Pierre-Jean de Béranger became famous for his songs ridiculing the aristocracy, the established church and the ultra-conservative parliament. He was imprisoned twice for his songs, in 1821 and 1828, which only added to his fame. His supporters around France sent "foie gras", fine cheeses and wines to him in prison. The celebrated Paris police chief Eugène François Vidocq sent his men to infiltrate the "goguettes" and arrest those who sang songs ridiculing the monarch.

Holzkirchen station

Holzkirchen station is a railway station on the Munich S-Bahn in the district of Holzkirchen in Upper Bavaria, Germany. It is served by the S-Bahn line , Bayerische Oberlandbahn (BOB) and Meridian.
Location.
Holzkirchen station is a junction station where the Munich–Holzkirchen railway, Mangfall Valley Railway (to Rosenheim), Holzkirchen–Lenggries railway and Holzkirchen–Schliersee railway join together.
History.
Holzkirchen station was opened on 31 October 1857 together with the section Großhesselohe-Rosenheim the Bavarian Maximilian Railway. The entire Maximilian Railway Ulm-Munich-Salzburg was completed on 1 August 1860. On 23 November 1861 a route to Miesbach was opened so that Holzkirchen became a railway junction. In 1862, the Munich–Holzkirchen railway was double-tracked due to the increasing volume of traffic. In 1868 the Holzkirchen-Miesbach line was extended to Hausham and in 1869 to Schliersee. On 15 October 1871, the Munich–Rosenheim railway (Munich-Grafing-Rosenheim) was opened, which made the previous detour of the Maximilian Railway over Holzkirchen unnecessary. Since most of the trains went via Grafing, the Bavarian Maximilian Railway and the Holzkirchen station lost their traffic.
On 1 June 1874 another outgoing line from Holzkirchen route to Bad Tölz was opened.
On 24 November 2009, there was a motor fire in an train of the Bayerische Oberlandbahn.

Cirrothauma

Cirrothauma is a genus of deep water octopuses from the cirrate family Cirroteuthidae. The species "Cirrothauma" are fragile, gelatinous deep-sea octopods with a shell, a moderate saddle, and triangular wings. Their eyes either have lenses, as seen in the species "Cirrothauma murrayi" or they have reduced eyes without lenses, shown in the other extant species "Cirrothauma magna". Both species were placed in "Cirrothauma" due to the fact that they possess similar shells. These octopuses have been reported to live in all the world's oceans, except for the Southern Ocean.
Species.
There are two currently recognised species within the genus "Cirrothauma"

Michael R. Strain

Michael R. Strain is an American economist. He is currently the Director of Economic Policy Studies and the Arthur F. Burns Scholar in Political Economy at the American Enterprise Institute. He is also a research fellow at the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, and a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion. Strain's research focuses on labor economics, public finance, and social policy.
Education and career.
Strain graduated from Rockhurst High School in Kansas City, Missouri, before attending Marquette University and graduating magna cum laude.
Strain holds a Ph.D. in economics from Cornell University. In 2005, he joined the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as an assistant economist until 2008 when he joined the Center for Economic Studies at the US Census Bureau. While still working at the US Census Bureau, he took up the job of administrator at the New York Census Research Data Centers in 2011.
In 2012, Strain left the Census Bureau and joined the American Enterprise Institute as a Research Fellow and later became the Deputy Director of Economic Policy Studies at the institute in 2015. Since becoming AEI’s Director of Economic Policy in 2016, Strain leads the work of the institute in the economic policy, financial markets, and health care policy.
He is the editor of "The US Labor Market: Questions and Challenges for Public Policy" He co-edited, with Stan Veuger, the "Economic Freedom and Human Flourishing: Perspectives from Political Philosophy." 
Strain has published academic research on the Paycheck Protection Program, the Earned Income Tax Credit, the gender pay gap, the effects of minimum wage laws, the Affordable Care Act, and payday lending. He has published policy research on increasing employment, the "socially optimal" top marginal income tax rate, worksharing unemployment insurance programs, the effects of job loss, and the federal budget.
In 2013, National Review's Reihan Salam described him as the "most important conservative reformer, and the one who could have the biggest beneficial impact on the well-being of Americans struggling to climb the economic ladder." He was featured in a 2014 "New York Times Magazine" cover story as one of the main intellectuals in the reform conservative movement. He contributed a chapter to "Room to Grow: Conservative Reforms for a Limited Government and a Thriving Middle Class", a reform conservative manifesto that New York Times columnist David Brooks called "the most coherent and compelling policy agenda the American right has produced this century." He was identified by Karl Rove in 2014 as one of the new "conservative reformers." His work has been cited by The Economist magazine as contributing “to an intellectual revolution in macroeconomics."
Strain's work on the economic policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic, employment, anti-poverty and upward mobility issues, and economic opportunity has been featured or profiled in many publications, including "The New York Times", The Atlantic, and National Review, among others. Strain was cited by The New York Times as being among the first economists to warn that President Biden’s stimulus plans could spark inflation. He is a regular guest on major media outlets, including CNBC, MSNBC, and Marketplace Radio. He has testified before Congress and speaks often to a variety of audiences.
In January 2020, Strain published "The American Dream is Not Dead: (But Populism Might Kill It)", in which he writes that despite popular conceptions about long-term economic stagnation, America is still broadly characterized by upward mobility. Strain argues that when measured properly, wages and incomes have risen over the past several decades. Thus, contrary to what populist politicians and commentators of both parties often say, America’s economic system is not “rigged.”
The book received mostly positive reviews. Washington Post columnist George F. Will praised the book as “an inoculation against politically motivated misinformation.” Former House speaker Paul Ryan wrote: “Without glossing over the real challenges that too many Americans face, Michael Strain makes a persuasive case that the American dream remains alive and well.” Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary, described the book as “a welcome antidote to the pervasive pessimism surrounding economic policy debates.” Robert Verbruggen in National Review wrote he had “one criticism of the book more broadly: There isn’t a whole lot here about how ‘populism could kill’ the American Dream,” but said the book would be “a good gift for that pessimistic reactionary down the street.”
Personal life.
Strain is Catholic. Strain and his wife have two children.

SPD party member vote on the 2018 coalition agreement of Germany

The SPD party member vote on the 2018 coalition agreement of Germany took place from 20 February to 2 March 2018. The membership of the center-left SPD decided via postal vote whether to accept a coalition agreement with Germany's center-right CDU and CSU. The result, 66.02% in favor of the Yes campaign, was published on 4 March 2018. It was decisive for Angela Merkel's plan to get re-elected as chancellor of Germany on 14 March in the German Bundestag.
Background.
From 2005, the SPD had been the junior partner in successive coalition governments led by Angela Merkel. After the German Federal elections in 2017 in which the SPD received only 20.5% of the vote, its worst result since the Second World War, SPD leader Martin Schulz ruled out any participation of his party in a new federal government with the CDU party of Angela Merkel. Even after the failed coalition talks between CDU, FDP, and Alliance 90/The Greens, the party board stuck to the decision. But, by late 2017, the attitude of the SPD's leadership had changed with its board voting in favor of exploratory talks in December that year. After the initial discussion's were successfully completed, the SPD entered formal coalition talks with CDU and CSU in January 2018. Martin Schulz had to step down after the coalition talks.
Procedure.
All SPD members received their election documents in the run up to 20 February 2018. All registered members on the 6 February 2018 at 6 p.m., (a total of 463,723) were eligible to vote. The question was: "Soll die Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD) den mit der Christlich Demokratischen Union (CDU) und der Christlich-Sozialen Union (CSU) ausgehandelten Koalitionsvertrag vom Februar 2018 abschließen?" ("Should the Social Democratic Party of Germany enter into the coalition treaty agreed with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union of Germany (CSU) in February 2018?")
Campaign.
Several SPD politicians asked the party members to vote Yes, such as Andrea Nahles and Thomas Oppermann. Kevin Kühnert, chairman of the Jusos party youth organisation and the #NoGroKo ("No Grand Coalition") initiative promoted the No campaign. Some SPD politicians such as SPD vice chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel feared extensive consequences for the party, in the case of a No vote. The Minister President of Lower Saxony, Stephan Weil, warned of a "phase of political instability" in the case of a No victory. Also, the German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel urged his party "not to retreat into the study rooms". New Federal elections were seen by many observers as a possible result of a No vote, whilst a CDU minority government was considered a possibility by some.
Result.
The result was 66.02% in favor of the coalition agreement.

Hamichlol

Hamichlol ( "The Entirety") is a censored wiki-based Internet encyclopedia project for the Haredi public. Most of the articles on the site are exact copies (as of the date they were copied) of articles from the Hebrew Wikipedia or re-edited versions of Hebrew Wikipedia articles, adapted for the ultra-Orthodox reader, while original articles currently constitutes only a small portion of all the articles on the site. The site is managed and operated by the Institute for Literacy and Proper Knowledge, which was established for the purpose of creating the site.
The editor community of the site censors mainly any mentioning of homosexuality, information that contradicts a creationist worldview, and behaviors deemed immodest. The site is referred to by the site owners as an "aspeklaria" (), which means in Latin "mirror", as it is a re-edited edition of the Hebrew Wikipedia.
The site was launched on January 11, 2015. As of October 2, 2020 the site contained 279,979 articles, which is about three thousand more than the Hebrew Wikipedia. However, many of the site's articles, such as the one on God, are being edited and reviewed for compliance with Talmudic law and are not available to the general public.
As of October 2, 2020 the site's Alexa's ranking was 222 in Israel.
Background.
In 2014 the Israeli Hasidic rabbi Yosef Kaminer founded the Institute for Literacy and Proper Knowledge () through which the site would be produced. The site is intended for the "Haredi" (Ultra-Orthodox Jews) public who are very conservative and refrain from using Wikipedia's content according to their stringent interpretations of "halakha". Hamichlol aspires to be "the largest Jewish encyclopedia in history, which includes articles on all issues pertaining to the Torah, Jewish values and the history of the Jewish people, but also knowledge pertaining to mankind and from all the secular" ( [transliteration: "hulin"]) "fields–written in clean language according to the Jewish worldview."
History and description.
Originally, the site of the site imported the entire Hebrew Wikipedia and re-edited or deleted the content which they considered not proper for the Torah-observant public, and specifically the ultra-Orthodox readers. The content is imported from the Hebrew Wikipedia in accordance with Wikipedia's free license, which enables editors to perform such a "split". It is easy to find information which was omitted by comparing specific articles on the site with the parallel articles at the Hebrew Wikipedia. Examples include:
The owners of the website state that in the instances in which imported articles from Wikipedia contain content deemed problematic, the editorial team of the website will gradually review the articles to determine whether the content is appropriate: problematic articles which also contain proper content will be rewritten, while the articles with totally inappropriate content will eventually be permanently deleted. As of August 25, 2018, some of the articles that are most sought-after at the Hebrew Wikipedia but are temporarily blocked awaiting review include: Gal Gadot, Ofra Haza, Sigmund Freud, New Testament, Academy Awards, Human evolution, Woman, Status quo (Israel), Age of Enlightenment, Breast cancer, Tower of Babel, Muslims, The Simpsons, Apocalypse, Table tennis, Homo, Platonic love, Sport in Israel, Bourekas films, Handball, Race (human categorization), Jewish and democratic state, Maccabiah Games, Catholic Church, Satire, Paganism, Samaritanism.

Józef Wielhorski (composer)

Count Józef Wielhorski (1816/1817–1892) was Polish pianist and composer.
Life and compositions.
Józef Wielhorski was born in Rusinów, Radom Governorate, in 1817 or 1818. His parents were count Józef Wielhorski and Salomea Dembińska (daughter of Wolbromska). When young Frédéric Chopin visited Rusinów, Józef swooned by listening to him playing piano. While studying at Berlin university, he took lessons from Wilhelm Taubert. He married Marya Iżycka, but this marriage provided no children.
Wielhorski was neither a professional virtuoso, nor a professional composer. He highly esteemed Mozart's music. According to Polish musician Jan Kleczyński, his own compositions, though being mostly bagatelles, valses and mazurkas, bear little reminiscences to those of Chopin. Another of his favorite genres was march. His compositions did not gain success even during his life, and he was not interested in this. Kleczyński explained such a failure through their relative difficulty: Wielhorski asks for much larger hands than was typical in salon music. His friend, the composer Aleksander Zarzycki performed some pieces by Wielhorski in concerts.
He died in a hotel in Sanremo, Italy, in an elevator accident.

Adeela Suleman

Adeela Suleman is a contemporary Pakistani sculptor and artist, based in Karachi. She is known for the social and political commentary underlying her sculptures, which are created out of mundane, everyday objects.
Suleman was an Associate Professor at the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture and served as Head of the Fine Arts Department at the university from 2008 to 2019. She is also the founding member and Director of Vasl Artists’ Association.
Early life &amp; education.
Adeela was born in Karachi, Pakistan, in 1970. She completed her bachelor's degree from St. Joseph's and then acquired a master's degree in international relations from the University of Karachi in 1995. After this, she switched her focus to art, completing a Bachelor of Fine Arts in sculpture from the Indus Valley School of Art &amp; Architecture in 1999.
Career.
Adeela's work takes domestic objects and materials from everyday life and transforms them into sculptures. Her art has consistently reflected an engagement with contemporary socio-political concerns, primarily gender in Pakistani society, an engagement that has continued from her earlier university days.
One of the themes running through her art is the restrictions that women face in the private sphere. She created helmets, body armour and corsets made out of kitchen utensils and other functional tools, to show the entrapment that the private sphere imposes upon women in Pakistani society.
Her more recent work has moved towards flatter silhouettes, creating tableaux on steel sheets, where pastoral scenes are rendered in the filigree tradition of Islamic art on the hard steel surface. These pastoral images are juxtaposed with symbols of destruction like weapons; the contradiction in these images signifies the indifference of society to the violence present within it. Suleman's work displays recurring motifs of organic elements like flowers and birds.
Adeela was the project coordinator of "Reimagining the walls of Karachi", a scheme, run by I am Karachi (a charity), that aimed to repaint the walls of the city and cover up the hate graffiti in 1600 different locations.
Exhibitions.
Adeela's work has been exhibited in both national and international exhibitions. Some of her exhibitions include:
Group.
She has also participated in the Singapore Biennale (2016), Sea Triennial, Jakarta (2013), Asia Triennial II, Manchester (2011), Fukuoka Asian Art Triennale (2002) and the Karachi Biennale (2017) and (2019).
Reviews and features of work appear in Artforum and the New York Times, among other publications.
Karachi Biennale 2019.
Adeela's installation, the "Killing Fields of Karachi", an exhibition on the 444 extra-judicial killings by Rao Anwar, a former Malir SSP (Senior Superintendent), was destroyed by law enforcement agencies. This sparked protest among Pakistani artists, academics and activists. The artist collective, Creative Process Projects, demanded that the Biennale and its organizers stand in support of Adeela. The call was endorsed by Sheema Kermani, Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy, Marvi Mazhar and others.
In a statement, organizers of the Karachi Biennale said: With regards to the exhibition in question, we feel that despite the artist’s perspective, it is not compatible with the ethos of KB19 whose theme is 'Ecology and the Environment'."
The statement added that "politicizing the [biennale] platform will go against our efforts to bring art into the public and drawing artists from the fringe to the mainstream cultural discourse".
Vasl Artists' Association.
Vasl Artists’ Association is affiliated with the Triangle Network, UK, an international network of artists and art organizations. The term ‘Vasl’ originating from both Urdu and Persian poetry, has an enriched deep association of a physical or transcendent connection between two. Inspired by this philosophy, Vasl Artist’s Association functions as a platform for encouraging the freedom to express and nurture creativity.
Established in 2001 and based in Karachi, Pakistan, Vasl is a not-for-profit organization (global network of artists and visual arts organization) that supports professional development and cultural exchange. Since its inception, more than 600 international and local artists have undertaken Vasl residencies, attended various workshops and created projects of significance. Adeela Suleman is a founding member of Vasl Artists' Association and the current Director of the company.

Y.G. Srimati

Y.G. Srimati (1926 - 2007) 20th century musician, dancer and painter born in Mysore, India. From a very young age, she was trained in Indian classical music, dance and painting . Y.G. Srimati became a highly accomplished vocalist and performer of Carnatic music and became a participant of the Indian Independence Movement from Chennai. She was deeply influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and at rallies addressed by him she would perform devotional songs in various Indian languages. She dedicated her art work to nationalist themes, often painting figures from Hindu mythology, her style being influenced by Nandalal Bose and the frescoes of the Ajanta Caves. Her talent was recognized and in 1952 during her first solo exhibition
Personal life.
Born in 1926 in Mysore then in the Kingdom of Mysore. Srimati grew up in Madras (now Chennai) in a Tamil Brahmin family. Her older brother, Y.G. Doraisami, mentored her in classical dance, singing, instrumental music and painting. Her grandfather was the chief astrologer in the court of the Maharaja of Mysore. The family initials of 'Y.G.' was an honorific title granted by the Maharaja. Her grandfather died when her father was a year old and her family's land was seized. Her father was married off at the age of six and was disinherited. Following which he dedicated himself to the education of his children.
Srimati danced as a child and her first solo performance happened when she was seven. She started to paint when she was in her early teens. Her brother was an art collector and he sponsored various artists.
In 1963, she got a scholarship to the Art Students League of New York, where she met fellow artist, Michael Pellettieri. They later became partners and he even went to contribute some of the paintings made by her to Metropolitan Museum of Art after she died.
Career.
Y.G Srimati’s career started when she received training in four traditional South Indian arts, voice, music, dance and painting. She became devoted towards these arts. She kept her lifelong friendship with Carnatic vocalist M.S. Subbulakshmi. During the Freedom Struggle, Y.G Srimati would often sing devotional songs at gatherings led by M.K Gandhi. 
She got the opportunity to go on a tour in India, United States and in the United Kingdom with the classical dancer Ram Gopal.
Influences &amp; Style.
The theme of Y.G. Srimati's paintings is based on devotion. She did not date or sign her work.
Most of Srimati's work was inspired from mythology and religion. She pursued her musical career even after shifting to New York. And the exhibition also includes one of her Tamburas which was the vestige of her musical career.
Srimati was intrigued by Indian religious epic literature and visions of rural culture. She had this nationalist sentiment which was the subject matter of the conscious expression. The Met Collection featured 25 watercoloured paintings which expressed musical instruments, archival photographs and performance recordings.
The art critic Holland Cotter said :
"Ms. Srimati’s choreographic take on naturalism makes everyday subjects—a woman dressing, a family riding to market—look heroic, and images of deities and saints look approachable human. In the end, she’s a devotional artist, in the religious or spiritual sense: Her 1947-48 painting of the Hindu goddess Saraswati was originally displayed on her family’s home altar."
Being a trained classical dancer, a lot of her artwork was dedicated to the treatment of the physical form. Some of her more popular paintings comprise 'The Bullock Cart' and 'Parashurama'. She died in 2007 in her hometown Chennai, at the age of 81.
The first retrospective exhibition of her work "An Artist of Her Time : Y.G. Srimati and the Indian Style" opened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2016.
Her work was influenced by ragas, dance positions and mythological tales. When she was 26, she had her first exhibition, inaugurating the Centenary Hall Madras Museum in the year 1952.

The Main Features of Cybernetics

"The Main Features of Cybernetics" () was a key text which led to the emergence of cybernetics in the Soviet Union, published in July–August 1955 volume of the state philosophical organ, "Voprosy filosofii" (Problems of Philosophy), No. 4. pp. 136–148. The article was attributed to three significant soviet scientists, Sergei Sobolev, Alexey Lyapunov, and Anatoly Kitov and, for the first time, presented the tenets of cybernetics to a Soviet audience. Alongside the article "What is Cybernetics" by Ernst Kolman, published in the same volume, Benjamin Peters has considered this article to have "set the stage for the revolution of cybernetics in the Soviet Union".
Kitov was the principal author. He had been delivering a number of lectures about cybernetics since 1953. He negotiated with Sobolev and Lyapunov to become joint authors, which they eventually agreed to.
The article outlined three areas of cybernetics:
A political point was added at the end of the article:
Impact.
The mathematician Victor Glushkov was living in Sverdlovsk when he read the article along with Kitov's book "Electronic digital machines". He saw the importance of cybernetics as being in relationship to computer science, and started leading a team working on the "Kiev Computer". Rather than seeing the computers as just a big adding machine, Glushkov approach meant working on areas which came to be called artificial intelligence.

Harewood House, Calstock

Harewood House was an ancient manor house, built originally by the Saxons, in Cornwall, England. It is located by an ancient river crossing, originally used by the Romans to get to a nearby Roman fort. Harewood Estate is surrounded by old mine workings, so the house faces towards Morwellham Quay.
History.
In Saxon times Calstock was in the Kingdom of Cornwall, which resisted the spread of Wessex from the east. In 838 CE Wessex had spread as far as the River Tamar, and a battle for independence was fought near Calstock. Following the Norman Conquest, Calstock manor was recorded in the Domesday Book. The Saxon manor (held by Asgar) was taken over, and in the 14th century became part of the Duchy of Cornwall: one of the 17 Antiqua maneria. 
At the time of Domesday Book (1086) the manor was held by Reginald from Robert, Count of Mortain. There were two and a half hides of land and land for 12 ploughs. Reginald held one virgate of land with 2 ploughs and 12 serfs. 30 villains and 30 smallholders had the rest of the land with 6 ploughs. There were 100 acres of woodland, 3 square leagues of pasture and 3 pigs. The value of the manor was £3 sterling though it had formerly been worth £6. 
The manor was sold by the Duchy to John Williams of Scorrier House circa 1807. 1807 saw Sir William Lewis Salusbury-Trelawny, 8th Baronet, of the Salusbury-Trelawny baronets, purchase the estate. 
St Andrew's Parish.
Granite cross.
A granite cross at the eastern end of the churchyard marks the grave of Sir William Lewis Salusbury-Trelawny, 8th Baronet, of Harewood House, Calstock, part of Salusbury-Trelawny baronets, who was for sometime the Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall and M.P. for East Cornwall. He died at Harewood in 1856, aged seventy five years. Folklore says that Sir William didn't want his body ever to leave his estate and so he was carried in through the back gate to his current resting spot, closest to his estate. Inside the church, just north of the pulpit, are two plaques:
Modern day.
Harewood House has since been changed. The house is now only two storeys tall as the roof height has been lowered. The building is divided east and west by a rather out-of-place looking large stone doorway. Whilst West Harewood House is a single residential property the East comprises two.

Lindau (island)

On the island of Lindau in the eastern Lake Constance is the "Altstadt" of the Bavarian county town of Lindau, which occupies the eastern part of the island. The island of Lindau, which forms 2% of the area and 12% of the population of the entire town, is one of the town's ten administrative districts. The district is just called "Insel" ("Island").
History.
The present island of Lindau originally consisted of three separate islands, which were formed by the moraine of the Rhine Glacier:
On an 1822 map (long before the construction of the railway, which opened in 1854) the three individual islands can be made out:
Even in 1831 it was said that: "the little town of Lindau lies on three islands in Lake Constance, linked by bridges…"
The remaining history of the island of Lindau is inextricably bound up with the history of the town of Lindau itself.
Geography.
The island of Lindau currently has about 3,000 inhabitants on an area of 68 hectares (0.68 km²). The last official figures from the population census of 25 May 1987 gave the population as 2755, making Lindau the second-largest island in Lake Constance after Reichenau in terms of area and population. For centuries, Lindau was the most populous island and it was only after the decline in population in the old town in the late 1980s that it passed the baton to Reichenau at the other end of the lake, which was six times the size and more rural in character. In the 1970 census, the island's population was still 4,413, and in 1904 as much as 5,853.
The island is separated from the Lindau quarter of Aeschach on the mainland by the Kleiner See. The "Kleiner See" is bounded in the east by the 150-metre-long Landtor Bridge ("Landtorbrücke"), over which the "Chelles Allee" runs, and in the west by the 410-metre-long railway causeway and covers an area of around 20 hectares. There was a bridge at this spot as early as the 13th century; by contrast the railway embankment was built in the 19th century. The railway causeway carries four tracks and has a heavily used cycleway and footpath on its eastern side. It has two bridges under which boats may pass. The railway running over the causeway from Aeschach to the island of Lindau was the last section of the Ludwig South-North Railway, to be taken into operation. It was opened on 1 March 1854 as part of the Allgäu Railway.
The old town of Lindau, which is a listed monument, occupies the large eastern part of the island of Lindau, also known as the "main island" ("Hauptinsel"). In the centre is the main street of "Maximilianstraße" with the two gable fronts of the town hall on the "Reichsplatz". Parallel to "Maximilianstraße" there is the "Ludwigstraße" in the south and the "Grub" in the north. The curvature of both roads enables the line of the medieval fortifications of the island to be seen. The smaller formerly separate island of "Hintere Insel" is located west of the historical town wall and the old moat. This rear part of the island was enlarged around 1970 by a good four hectares, by the reclamation of an area of the lake between the "Pulverschanze" and the "Sternschanze". It now covers an area of eleven hectares, about one sixth of the island and is dominated by the Lake Constance Clinic of ENT physician and cosmetic surgeon, Werner Mang. The westernmost point of the "Hintere Insel" and of the whole island is marked by the 1508 Powder Tower and the former Luitpold-Kaserne built in 1902/03.

SS D.R. Hanna

SS "D.R. Hanna" was a long American Great Lakes freighter that operated on the Great Lakes from November 12, 1906 to her sinking on May 16, 1919 after a collision with "Quincy A. Shaw". "D.R. Hanna" was like many other freighters, and was used to haul bulk cargoes such as iron ore, coal and grain.
History.
"D.R. Hanna" (Official number 203676) was a product of the American Ship Building Company of Lorain, Ohio and was built for the Pioneer Steamship Company (Hutchinson &amp; Company, Mgr.) of Fairport, Ohio. She had a length of , a beam of and a height of . She was powered by a triple expansion steam engine and fueled by two coal-fired Scotch marine boilers. She had a gross register tonnage of 7,023 tons and a net register tonnage of 5,491 tons. She was launched on October 20, 1906 as hull number #346.
On September 1, 1910 "D.R. Hanna" collided with the steamer "Harvey H. Brown". "D.R. Hanna" was sent to Detroit, Michigan for temporary repairs. On September 29, 1910 "D.R. Hanna" sailed to Cleveland, Ohio. "Harvey H. Brown" was badly damaged and it did not sail at all in that shipping season.
On October 13, 1915 "D.R. Hanna" had of her foremast knocked off when she struck the Superior Avenue high level bridge in Cleveland. She had a new foremast installed in Detroit.
On May 19, 1916 "D.R. Hanna" ran aground near the Little Rapids Cut after her steering gear failed. She was temporarily repaired and sailed to Chicago, Illinois for repairs.
On September 6, 1918 "D.R. Hanna" ran aground on the Detour Shoal on Lake Huron. She was bound for Indiana Harbor, Indiana with a cargo of iron ore. The steam barge "F.T. Newman" was sent to assist "D.R. Hanna". Meanwhile, the long freighter "LaSalle" ran aground and the steam barge "Reliance" was sent to her aid. As soon as "Reliance" freed "LaSalle" she went to free "D.R. Hanna". After she was freed the "Hanna" sailed to Indiana Harbor and unloaded her cargo; after unloading the "Hanna" was taken to the Ecorse, Michigan yard of the Great Lakes Engineering Works where she was placed in dry dock She damaged between 50 and 60 of her steel hull plates, her stern post and her rudder stock. She also cracked her tail shaft.
Final voyage.
On May 16, 1919 "D.R. Hanna" was bound from Duluth, Minnesota for Buffalo, New York with 377,000 bushels of wheat in her cargo hold when she was rammed by "Quincy A. Shaw" in heavy fog. "Quincy A. Shaw" was upbound with coal at the time the collision occurred. Soon after the collision "D.R. Hanna" rolled over and sank. Her crew were rescued by "Quincy A. Shaw". No lives were lost. The cargo of "D.R. Hanna" was valued at $840,000, the insurance loss was set at $421,000.
"D.R. Hanna" today.
The remains of "D.R. Hanna" rest in of water about off the Thunder Bay Island Light. Her wreck was located upside down in October 1919. The wreck of "D.R. Hanna" in part of the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve and is also the largest wreck in the underwater preserve. The closest wreck of a steam-powered freighter is the wreck of which was lost during the White Hurricane of 1913.

List of songs recorded by Kiss

Kiss is an American Hard Rock band from New York City, New York. Formed in January 1973, the group originally included rhythm guitarist and vocalist Paul Stanley, bassist and vocalist Gene Simmons, lead guitarist Ace Frehley and drummer Peter Criss. Songwriting is typically led by Stanley and Simmons, who also perform the majority of lead vocals, although all members regularly contribute. The band's self-titled debut album featured only one songwriting credit for Frehley and Criss (on "Love Theme from Kiss", written by all four members), as well as a cover version of Bobby Rydell's "Kissin' Time". Frehley wrote or co-wrote three songs on "Hotter than Hell", and two on 1975's "Dressed to Kill". For "Destroyer", the band worked closely with producer Bob Ezrin, who was credited for songwriting on seven of the album's nine tracks.
"Rock and Roll Over", released in 1976, was again led by Stanley and Simmons, with Sean Delaney co-credited alongside the former on three tracks. 1977's "Love Gun" featured a writing credit each for Frehley and Criss, as well as a cover of "Then She Kissed Me", originally by The Crystals. After each member released an eponymous solo album in 1978, Kiss returned in 1979 with "Dynasty", which featured session drummer Anton Fig in place of the injured Criss. Fig also performed on "Unmasked" the following year, by which time Criss had left Kiss. "Unmasked" included several songwriters from outside of the band, including producer Vini Poncia on all but three tracks. Following the addition of Eric Carr on drums, the band released "Music from "The Elder"" in 1981, which was the last to feature Frehley who departed the following year.
Frehley was replaced by Vinnie Vincent, who first wrote and performed on "Creatures of the Night" in 1982. The album also featured two songs co-written by Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance. Vincent remained for the 1983 follow-up "Lick It Up", although left after the album's touring cycle. He was replaced for "Animalize" by Mark St. John, which included songs co-written by Desmond Child, Mitch Weissman and Jean Beauvoir. Bruce Kulick debuted on "Asylum" as the band's fourth lead guitarist, which again included credits for Child and Beauvoir. "Crazy Nights" and "Hot in the Shade" featured returning contributors Poncia, Child and Weissman, as well as new additions such as Tommy Thayer, Michael Bolton and Bob Halligan Jr. Carr died of cancer on November 24, 1991, with Eric Singer taking over as the band's drummer.
The band's 1992 release "Revenge" was largely co-written with Ezrin, who had returned as producer. In 1996, Frehley and Criss returned for an original lineup reunion tour. The group released "Psycho Circus" in 1998, which was primarily written by Stanley and Simmons with contributions from Curtis Cuomo, Holly Knight, Karl Cochran, Ezrin and Kulick. By 2004, the lineup of Kiss included lead guitarist Thayer and drummer Singer. The group's next studio album followed in 2009 – "Sonic Boom" was written entirely by the band's members, with all but Singer credited. 2012's "Monster" credited the drummer on just one track, "Back to the Stone Age", which was written by the whole band. In early 2015, Kiss released a single in collaboration with Japanese idol group Momoiro Clover Z entitled "Yume no Ukiyo ni Saite Mi na".

Margaret Hills

Margaret Hills (née Robertson 1882 – 1967) was a British teacher, suffragist organiser, feminist and socialist. She was first female councillor on Stroud District Council and later served as a Councillor on Gloucestershire County Council.
Early life.
Margaret Robertson was born at 41 Fitzroy Road, Primrose Hill, London on 1 March 1882. Her father, Henry Robert Robertson, was an artist of Scottish extraction and Her mother, Agnes Lucy Turner, was a descendant of Robert Chamberlain, who founded the china works of Chamberlain &amp; Son at Worcester (which later became Royal Worcester), and her mother's relatives included John Davidson (traveller), the African explorer, and George Fownes, both of whom were Fellows of the Royal Society. Her paternal grandfather had a private school in Slough.
Her siblings were botanist Agnes Arber, classicist Donald Struan Robertson and portrait artist Janet Robertson. She is the great aunt of musician Thomas Dolby.
Hills attended North London Collegiate School (founded by Frances Buss) and obtained an open scholarship in 1901 to attend Somerville College, Oxford and obtained first class honours in 1904 (at a time when women were not awarded degrees by the University). She was later awarded a Batchelor of Arts by Trinity College Dublin in 1906, in common with many other Oxbridge Women as neither University awarded women degrees
She attended the Cambridge Training College for Women from 1904 -1905 and obtained a Teacher Training Certificate and joined the staff of the Queen Elizabeth Grammar School for Girls, Mansfield and left the school at Christmas 1907 to seek a teaching post in London, however, "she finally decided to give up teaching for the present and work for the cause[ Women's Suffrage]"
Suffragist organiser.
The first recorded occasion of Margaret being involved in Women's Suffrage was as a floor speaker at a Women's Suffrage meeting in St Augustine's Hall, Highgate, London in February 1908. It is likely that she was already working for NUWSS as, the following month she worked on campaigns at both the Hastings and Peckham by-elections and wrote an article in Women's Franchise on the NUWSS policy concerning By-elections. The July 1908 Masthead of the NUWSS pages within Women's Franchise lists Margaret as an NUWSS Organiser. Later in the year the NUWSS could proudly announce that it employed three permanent organisers, including Margaret
She was appointed as Organiser for the North of England Society for Women's Suffrage in May 1909 By1911 this had become the Manchester and District Federation of Women's Suffrage Societies and she described herself as Organising Secretary in the 1911 census. In December 1912 she was appointed the organiser of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies Election Fighting Fund.
She was an organiser and speaker in various key public debates about women's suffrage, including a debate at the Royal Albert Hall in November 1912, and in the Co-operative Hall, Burnley in 1910.
Hills lobbied both the nascent Labour Party and the Miner's Federation, including Robert Brown, Provost of Dalkeith and Secretary of the Scottish Miners Federation, who was fielded as the first Labour Party candidate to contest the seat in the 1912 Midlothian by-election.
Peace activities.
Hills was a pacifist and opposed the First World War. In 1915 the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom held a summit in the Hague. She was organising secretary to the original British organising committee and responsible for negotiating the supply of passports for attendees with the Government (at that time passports were issued on a single trip basis). She was also a member of the Executive Committee of the Movement for Democratic Control
As an elected representative.
In April 1928, Hills was elected to Stroud Urban District Council. She is credited with driving through housing improvements including Stroud's first slum clearance scheme at Middle Hill, off Bisley Old-Road, Stroud.
In 1937 Hills was elected to Gloucestershire County Council, where she remained as a councillor until 1952. She served on the education committee after she ceased to be a councillor. Her work is remembered in the name of a housing estate in the town.
Personal life.
Hills met her future husband, Harold Hills, in 1913, whilst holidaying at Pella Italy where they were introduced by mutual friend Fenner Brockway. A few days after they met they swam a mile across Lake Orla and announced their engagement two months later. On 6 August 1914, two days after the First World War broke out, they were married at Hampstead. Fenner Brockway states "I congratulated Harold on marrying Margaret, but I have never forgiven him for taking her out of politics." On the same evening they were married, Harold, a reservist doctor in the RAMC, reported for duty at Aldershot with the 4th Field Ambulance and landed in France on 16 August with the Expeditionary Force. He was reported missing with eight other doctors from the Field Ambulance, it was later reported that he had been taken prisoner of war but was part of British/German prisoner exchange of medics on 1 July 1915.
Harold Hills had trained as a doctor before the War and was employed at Long Grove Hospital, Epsom which was a London County Council mental hospital, to which he returned to after the war, for a time. His time with the 4th Army included giving expert evidence in Court Martials concerning soldiers facing charges of desertion
In 1922 they moved to Stroud, where Harold took over the practice of Doctor Henry Hardy at 11 Rowcroft and succeeded him as Certifying Surgeon under the Factories Acts. The family took up residence at the surgery and remained there until they moved to Cotsmoor, Private Road, Rodborough (now known as Lotus Cottage). In 1954 they downsized to a smaller house in the grounds which remained the family home for the rest of their lives.
Their first child, Margaret Clare, was born on 18 February 1917 at Mossley Hill, Liverpool.

Louis-François-Sébastien Fauvel

Louis-François-Sebastien Fauvel (born September 14, 1753 in Clermont-en-Beauvaisis and died March 12, 1838 in Smyrna) was a French painter, diplomat and archaeologist who was long stationed in Athens. Fauvel has been called the "Father of Archeology in Greece."
Biography.
Louis-François-Sébastien Fauvel made his first stay in Greece in 1780-1782 in the service of the Comte de Choiseul-Gouffier. His archaeological work was meant to complete the Comte's "Voyage pittoresque de la Grèce". When the Count was appointed the ambassador of France to the Sublime Porte in 1784, he again engaged Fauvel. The latter did not support the life of the embassy in the Ottoman capital and did many archaeological trips to collect the material for the future publications and the collection of antiques of his patron, through Greece or in the summer of 1789, Egypt. It was then that he expressed his tiredness of working for someone who did not recognize his qualities.
Fauvel settled permanently in Athens in the summer of 1793, after the emigration of Choiseul-Gouffier to Russia. In February 1796, he ended up being recognized for his archaeological work and named "non-resident partner" of the Institut de France. This assured him of funding for the pursuit of his research. He succeeded, for example, in sending to the Louvre a metope and a section of the Parthenon frieze.
The Egyptian campaign entailed his imprisonment and his expulsion from the Ottoman Empire. He arrived in complete destitution in Paris in December 1801, sixteen years after leaving France. He participated in the work of the Institute. Seeking to return to Greece, he obtained the post of Vice-Consul of France in Athens. He was back there in January 1803. There he competed with Lord Elgin's agents, including Giovanni Battista Lusieri, for the Parthenon marbles. Taking advantage of the reversal of the alliances, the French vice-consul managed to make the self-same agents search on his behalf. However, he could not carry out the archaeological work he was considering: he could not get away from Athens where his consular activities, however rare, held him back. Above all, he did not have the financial means to open large projects.
He then contented himself with limited research that he never published. In the same way, he sold the objects that he discovered, thus leaving the travellers who became the owners to publish their works on his discoveries. However, he played a key role in the development of archaeological knowledge of Athens and Attica by making the "cicerone" (guide) to the "tourists" who visited him.
During the Greek War of Independence Fauvel held anti-Hellenic sentiments. He fled the fighting and fled to Smyrna where he died.

Thomas Dennis (priest)

Thomas John Dennis (1869-1917) was an Anglican priest who was the main translator of the Bible into the Igbo language.
Childhood and education.
Dennis was born into a farming family in Langney in Sussex on 17 September 1869 and grew up in Cuckfield, Guestling and St Leonards. He was the eldest of eight children, four of whom were to follow him into overseas Christian mission. 
He applied to joined the Church Missionary Society (CMS) in 1889, and because he had not been able to complete his education, was sent to the CMS Institution in Clapham before attending the CMS training college in Islington. 
Dennis was ordained in St Paul's Cathedral in 1893, and served for some months as an assistant curate in the parish of St. Marys, Islington.
Work in West Africa.
He was assigned to West Africa in 1893. He was acting Vice-Principal of Fourah Bay College, Freetown, Sierra Leone (1893–1894) before joining the Niger Mission in November 1894. Initially, his duties were mainly administrative, as acting mission secretary in 1895. He married Matilda (Mattie) Silman in 1897, and in the same year, following the death of H. H. Dobinson, was appointed mission secretary. He was appointed Archdeacon of Onitsha in 1905, although he had been fulfilling this responsibility de facto since 1897. He was Commissary and Examining Chaplain to the Rt Rev. Herbert Tugwell, Bishop in Western Equatorial Africa. He studied at Durham University, completing a BA in 1902 as an unattached student.
Bible translation.
Dennis was one of the new generation of Evangelicals who were disappointed that the Niger mission was not a "Scriptural Mission". Most translation efforts were directed towards hymnals and liturgy, the only previous Bible translation work being an extremely literal translation of the four gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, and some of the Pauline epistles. 
Dennis therefore undertook a new translation of the Bible into the Igbo language under the auspices of the British and Foreign Bible Society. It was considered that he alone had anything near what could be regarded as the experience and training for translation work. He was a key player in the development of Union Igbo, a written standard intended to serve all dialects. The Union Igbo New Testament was published in 1908 and the whole Bible in 1913. By the time of his death, five years later, 25,215 Bibles had been sold. This version was very influential but criticised by artists, among them Chinua Achebe, as stultifying the Igbo language.
He also published a grammar of Igbo (1901), a literacy primer (1903, revised 1911), and an Igbo translation of "Pilgrim's Progress".
Death.
In 1917 Dennis and his wife set sail for England on the Elder Dempster steamship "Karina". On 1 August they were torpedoed off the south coast of Ireland just outside Queenstown and the ship sank. Mattie was rescued but Dennis drowned. One of their suitcases, containing a draft of the Igbo-English dictionary and part of an Igbo grammar, later washed up on the coast of Wales. A fisherman found it, broken open on the beach. He collected the papers and dried them out. The suitcase had Dennis's name printed on the outside, and also contained the address of a donor. The fisherman wrote to her, and she in turn contacted Mattie. By this means the dictionary manuscript was eventually returned to CMS, who published it in 1923.
Legacy.
The Dennis Memorial Grammar School in Onitsha is named after him.

Endsleigh Gardens

Endsleigh Gardens is a street in the Bloomsbury district of central London, in the London Borough of Camden. It runs south-west to north-east from Gordon Street to Woburn Place. The south-west end becomes Gower Place after the junction with Gordon Street. Taviton Street and Endsleigh Street run off the south side.
Endsleigh Gardens was formerly the south side of Euston Square, which in 1878 was the site of the "Euston Square Murder". In 1879 the Metropolitan Board of Works renamed the street Endsleigh Gardens in response to local requests.
Euston Square Murder.
Endsleigh Gardens was originally the southern part of Euston Square. In 1877 or 1878, number four Euston Square was the site of a murder that became popularly known as the "Euston Square Murder" after the body of Matilda Hacker was found in the coal cellar of the house in 1879. She had last been seen in 1877. 
Hannah Dobbs, a former servant at the house and mistress of the leaseholder Severin Bastendorff, was arrested after it was found that she had pawned some of Hacker's possessions. In 1879 she was tried for murder at the Old Bailey, but acquitted due to lack of evidence.
Renaming.
As of 25 September 1879, the Metropolitan Board of Works of London recorded the receipt of a letter from the Vestry of Saint Pancras, asking that the south side of Euston Square be renamed Endsleigh Gardens, and the houses renumbered. The vestry had received the request from George Cubitt, M. P., a freeholder of the south side of Euston Square, along with a petition signed by "nearly the whole of the leaseholders and occupiers of the houses there". The vestry meeting had voted in favour, 69 to 3. 
As of 28 November 1879, a committee reported to the Metropolitan Board of Works in favour of the request, and as of 5 December 1879, the change was moved, seconded and resolved.
The reasons for the request are not recorded in the Board of Works' minutes. Some accounts suggest that the name was changed to avoid the notoriety of the Euston Square Murder. As early as 1884 "The Building News" noted, in discussing various name changes, that "A little while before the inhabitants of the north [sic] side of Euston-square tried to bury the murderous memories attached thereto beneath the name of Endsleigh-gardens."
Buildings.
Friends House is on the north side of the street between Endsleigh Gardens and the Euston Road.
A 1953 Ordnance Survey map shows on the south side the Endsleigh Hotel on the corner with Gordon Street, a YWCA hostel and the Caledonian Christian Club between Taviton Street and Endsleigh Street, and the Cora Hotel at the east end on the corner with Upper Woburn Place. On the north side is Drayton House on the corner with Gordon Street, Friends House, and a weights and measures office for the London County Council.
Notable residents.
Residents of the street have included: 
On 10 September 1889, the poet and novelist Amy Levy killed herself at the family home at No 7, aged 27, by carbon monoxide poisoning after suffering from depression. There has been some campaigning for a blue plaque there to remember her. Oscar Wilde described her as "a girl who has a touch of genius in her work".
In the 1890s, there were reports of prostitution in the area. Resident James Stock complained to the Metropolitan Police of "the fearful prevalence… of a gross state of street prostitution attended by features of a very disgusting character, particularly between the hours of 10 and 12 at which it is not fit for any respectable female to walk about and young men cannot do so without molestation."

Lesley Fitton

Josephine Lesley Fitton (born 1953) is a British classical archaeologist and the Keeper of the Department of Greece and Rome at the British Museum. She is particularly known for her work on the Minoans, the Cyclades, and the Greek Bronze Age.
Education and career.
Fitton was born in Rochdale in 1953 and attended Bury Grammar School for Girls where she was friends with Victoria Wood.
Fitton has spent her career working at the British Museum. She started as a research assistant in the Department of Greece and Rome, and then progressed to become the Assistant Keeper responsible for the Greek Bronze Age collections. Since 2007, Fitton has been the Keeper (Head of Department).
She was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 29 April 1999.
Fitton's current work includes the digitisation of the collection of Cypriot antiquities at the British Museum. She also works on Troy.
Fitton has written a number of books to make her subject matter accessible to undergraduates and general readers. Her 2002 book "Minoans" was pitched to make the latest archaeological information accessible and affordable to students.
She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to museums and the arts.
Television and film.
Fitton has appeared or consulted on several television series:
Troy.
Fitton also gave advice on historical accuracy to the producers and cast of Troy in 2004. Fitton reflected on her experience in a 2009 volume on the film, where she considered whether the film should have adhered more closely to historical facts. While Fitton believed that the film could have done more to reflect historical and archaeological realities, she concluded that:Yet my personal view is that the story is not history, that Homer was not a historian, and that something of Homer would certainly have been lost in a purist archaeological approach. Ultimately, dramatic success matters more than the archaeological accuracy of Helen’s hairpins. It matters more for modern audiences to feel for Achilles in his progress from war machine to man, to sympathize with Hector in his efforts to defend all that was dear to him, and in the end to mourn for Priam and for Troy.

Anatole-Joseph Toulotte

Anatole-Joseph Toulotte (7 January 1852 – 23 January 1907) was a French White Fathers missionary who was Vicar Apostolic of Sahara and Sudan from 1893 to 1897.
Under his leadership the first White Fathers missions were established in the French Sudan (Mali) at Ségou and Timbuktu.
A solitary, ascetic person, he was not a natural leader and drove himself too hard without regard for his health.
He retired in 1897 due to physical and mental exhaustion after a long trip in West Africa.
He is known as coauthor of a monumental history of Christian Africa in ancient times.
Life.
Early years (1852–74).
Anatole-Joseph Toulotte was born on 7 January 1852 in Lisbourg, Pas-de-Calais, in the diocese of Arras.
He attended the college of Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais, for his secondary education.
He entered the Grand Seminary of Arras in 1871.
He was inspired by a visit of Father Félix Charmetant() and decided to become a missionary.
He arrived in Algiers in February 1873 with his co-student Léonce Bridoux, the future bishop, to begin his novitiate.
He was ordained a priest of the White Fathers on 24 October 1874.
Missionary (1874–91).
Toulotte perfected his Arabic and taught this language in the novitiate.
In 1875 he was elected a member of the General Council of the White Fathers, and was also given direction of the Arab novitiate or "Petit Noviciat".
He was then assigned to the Sahara for two years, where he met the young Father Siméon Lourdel.
After this he was assigned to Jerusalem as part of the first team of White Fathers in this city, where he remained for two years.
He showed great ability for the study of languages and ancient documents.
He was somewhat solitary and ascetic, and did not always fit well into the life of the community.
In September 1880 he was named assistant general and returned to Algiers, where Cardinal Charles Lavigerie gave him direction of the novitiate.
A few months later Toulotte volunteered to leave in a planned caravan to Equatorial Africa.
Lavigerie named him superior of the fourth caravan but then, perhaps due to shortage of personnel, cancelled this appointment and asked him to return to Jerusalem.
Two years later in 1884 Toulotte was assigned to La Marsa, near Tunis, with three other researchers.
They were tasked with preparing publication of a monumental history of ancient Christian Africa.
He continued this work in Rome in a new community established there in 1886.
Apostolic vicariate (1891–97).
The Apostolic Prefecture of the Sahara and the Sudan became an apostolic vicariate in 1891.
Lavigerie appointed Toulotte the coadjutor bishop.
He left Rome to take up this position.
Toulotte was a meticulous academic and a solitary ascetic, not a leader.
The cardinal would have preferred the more outgoing Augustin Hacquard to head the apostolic vicariate, but the White Fathers council had selected Toulotte due to his saintly reputation.
Toulotte became Apostolic Administrator of Sahara and Sudan on 29 May 1891.
On 2 June 1891 he was appointed Titular Bishop of Thagaste.
He was ordained in the cathedral of Algiers in the Archdiocese of Algiers on 12 July 1891.
Lavigerie died at Algiers on 26 November 1892.
Toulotte automatically became Vicar Apostolic after the cardinal's death.
Toulotte was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Sahara and Sudan on 4 March 1893.
His principal consecrator was Barthélemy Clément Combes, Bishop of Constantine.
At this time the vicariate had five missions in the M'zab but none in the Sudan.
Toulotte based himself at Ghardaïa, Algeria, and travelled widely to visit the existing White Fathers missions and to found new ones.
Toulotte decided to organize a mission in the Sudan, and in 1894 was given permission to enter the Sudan from Senegal with a mission headed by a Frenchman.
The Ministry of the Colonies issued the authorization on 9 November 1894 and on 25 December 1894 the first caravan, four White Fathers, left from Marseille.
Hacquard was the leader of this group, which reached Ségou on the Niger River on 1 April 1895.
Toulotte visited Ségou and Timbuktu in 1896–97.
The long trip of several months took him to the loop of the Niger River and to the Atlantic coast at Conakry in what is now Guinea.
He was ascetic and unsparing of his health, and at the end of this trip was exhausted and on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
Last years (1897–1907).
On his return to Europe Toulotte said he wanted to retire.
His request was immediately accepted by the Holy See on the advice of Bishop Léon Livinhac, superior of the White Fathers, who had noted his extreme physical and mental exhaustion.
Toulotte resigned on 18 October 1897.
He was succeeded by Hacquard.
Toulotte retired to Rome, where he recovered his health while living an almost hermit-like life.
Anatole-Joseph Toulotte died in Rome on 23 January 1907.
He left a reputation of great sanctity.

Diamond Babu

Diamond Babu is an Indian film public relations officer and media consultant who predominantly works in Tamil cinema. He has worked more than 600 films as public relations officer in Indian cinema.
Early life.
Babu's father Film News Anandan was one of the earliest journalists, managers and chroniclers of Tamil cinema, and he wanted his son to enter the film industry. Babu, on the other hand, was comfortably educated in Delhi and employed in a bank. To satisfy his father's wish, he left his bank job, started the "Diamond" film club and screened films for a close group at Devi Bala, Sathyam and Subham theatres in the early 80's. Tamil films faced some hiccups at the censors, and one such trouble was the reason Babu became a fully fledged PRO, since he realised that being knowledgeable in Hindi, he could be a bridge between the north and the south.
Career.
In 1986, when producer Aabhavanan wanted to convert a five-minute documentary into a commercial film, Babu's father canvassed for funds—the concept of crowdfunding is not new – and Babu got drawn into the struggle and was made the PRO.
In 1986, when Oomai Vizhigal faced some hurdle in getting the censorship, Babu was able to liaise with the tribunal in Delhi. The film, starring Vijayakanth was a blockbuster hit. After Oomai Vizhigal his next nine films were also successive blockbuster hits and he was looked as lucky PRO in Tamil film industry.

Francesca Grilli

Francesca Grilli (born 1978) in Bologna Italy is a visual artist best known for her performances, film and installation pieces.
Early life and education.
Francesca Grilli was educated at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Bologna (IT) where she received her BA in 1997, she received an MA from the Istituto Superiore per le Industrie Artistiche in Urbino (IT) in 2001. In 2005 she was selected for the Advanced Course in Visual Art at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Como (IT), visiting professor Alfredo Jaar. She attended the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam in 2007-2008.
Career.
Francesca Grilli's early works focus on videos documenting her performances inspired by her interaction with members of her family, such as "194.9 MHz" (2006) for example, where she describes the relationships with her father, or "Gordon" (2007) where she invited her grandfather to play Bocce with her. Since 2006 her focus shifts to performance and sound installations such as "Arriverà e ci coglierà di sorpresa" (2006) where she invited two elderly dancers to dance Tango for 3 hours in front of a video projection of an empty dancehall. The next year she presented "Enduring Midnight" (2007) where she asked an aged woman, who used to be a Soprano singer, to perform at midnight. Both the performances stress on the ageing body in relation to time and their ability to challenge their physical limits putting memory to test.
With "Moth" (2009) she started a research about the idea of the 'resistant body', meaning a body with some sort of physical limitation, which sees such limitation as a special condition to explore, within a performative act. The work analyzes the relationship between a singer affected by Albinism and light, through a scientific experiment which uses the Rubens' tube. The performer interacts with the light source generated by the experiment in order to control it: the flame reacts on the voice of the performer according to her tone and volume. 
In 2010 she realizes "The Conversation" where she invited a deaf teenager to listen to live music through the vibration produced by the sound waves, and to sing using the Italian Sign Language. The performance was the recipient of the Nuove Arti award, promoted by the Museo d'Arte Moderna di Bologna, Italy.
"Gold" (2011), "Iron" (2011) and "Variazioni per Voce" (2012) focus on the state censorship on music operated by the Istituto Centrale per i Beni Sonori ed Audiovisivi di Roma (IT) emphasizing on the paradox between the preservation of cultural heritage and its destruction.
In "Fe2O3, OSSIDO FERRICO" presented at the Italian Pavillion at the Venice Biennale in 2013, she incorporates some elements of her previous artworks, in particular, the use of sound as the main element. The artist invited a group of female performers, who were asked to interact daily with a massive iron wall through vocalizations for six months. A microphone was connected to a mechanism that released drops of water on the iron surface causing its corrosion. The idea was to eventually open a gap on the wall using the performances' voices and water.
In 2015 for the performance "Family" presented at the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven (NL) she invited a family from the city composed by 4 individuals (a child, a father, a mother and a grandmother) to sing a repertoire related to the museum's collection, every change of season until 2017. Throughout two years the members of the family grew older and their voices changed, especially as regards the youngest and the oldest family member. Every performance was documented with a photograph and audio recorded in order to prove the effect of time on the bodies and the voices. The museum acquired the documentation which is now part of the collection.
The "Forgetting of Air" (2016) uses air as the material shared between the audience and the performer. Considering breathing as the first individual autonomous action that brings life to a being and inspired by the recent facts regarding migratory fluxes throughout the Mediterranean Sea, Grilli invited professional and non-professional performers with a refugee background to just breath into a cone-shaped device in a room filled with steam. Due to the fact that the performers had experienced first hand the risk of suffocation or drowning the work enphasisez on the precariousness of human life.
Work.
Awards and nominations.
In 2016 she was recipient of the Premio NY promoted by Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with the Italian Academy and the Columbia University in New York (US). In 2013 she won the Nettuno d'oro in Bologna (IT). In 2010 she won the Terna Prize in Rome (IT) and she was nominated for the Fritschly prize, Het Domein Museum (NL). In 2009 she was awarded the Nuove Arti award by the Museo d'Arte Moderna di Bologna(IT). In 2008 she was nominated for the Emerging Talents Award, Strozzina Foundation, Florence (IT) and she won the Italian Wave award at Artissima, Turin (IT). In 2007 she was recipient of the ICEBERG prize in Bologna (IT) and in 2006 she won the International Performance Award at the Centrale Fies, Dro (IT).

List of stations owned or operated by Nexstar Media Group

Nexstar Media Group is the largest owner of television stations in the United States, currently owning or operating a total of 197 television stations across the United States, many of which are affiliates of the four major U.S. television networks and are located in markets as large as New York City and as small as San Angelo, Texas. It also operates all of the stations owned by affiliated companies, such as Mission Broadcasting, Vaughan Media, and White Knight Broadcasting under local marketing agreements.
The following stations listed below are either owned and operated by Nexstar, or controlled by Nexstar through management services agreements (MSAs) with affiliated companies like Mission Broadcasting and Shield Media, among others, to comply with current FCC ownership limits. Until November 2015, Nexstar also held the license of one station which was operated by Sinclair Broadcast Group through an MSA. Most of the stations Nexstar owns and operates were acquired through acquisitions of Quorum Broadcasting in 2003, Newport Television in 2012, Communications Corporation of America in 2015, Media General in 2017, and Tribune Media in 2019.
Each Nexstar cluster also operates its own news website, though many stations owned by Nexstar before the Media General merger do not use their station branding or call letters in the addresses, choosing to use a slogan related to their area instead. Despite this, in all cases, all call letter-specific addresses are retained by Nexstar and redirect to a station's site for familiarity to site visitors and to discourage cybersquatting. The Media General and Tribune stations acquired by Nexstar (the Media General deal also included Frankly, which provides platform software and CMS services for many television station websites) have all retained their previous addresses, including call letter-specific addresses, and as a direct result of the deal, some Nexstar stations have resumed using call-only addresses. Slogan web addresses have generally been deprecated across the broadcast industry with the rise of social media, specifically due to fake news 'local news' websites which also use slogan addresses, and are easily confused with real broadcast stations.
Formerly, Nexstar stations also maintained separate deal of the day sites on the .biz domain with paid "ask the experts" sections and advertorial sections, though the decline of the local deal of the day business model, along with wariness of viewers of .biz sites from its association with spam marketing saw these sites eventually close when the Media General deal closed.

Stations are arranged alphabetically by state and by city of license.

Peter Gottfried Kremsner

Peter Gottfried Kremsner (born 16 May 1961 in Wiener Neustadt, Austria) is a specialist in tropical medicine and Full Professor at the University of Tübingen, Germany. Since 1992 he has been leading the Centre de Recherches Médicales de Lambaréné (CERMEL), Gabon, now as president. For about three decades Kremsner has played an important role in the worldwide research of tropical infectious diseases.
Biography.
Kremsner grew up in Sigleß, Austria. He studied medicine at the University of Vienna and graduated as a Doctor of Medicine in 1985. He started his academic career as a medical researcher at the Institute of Specific Prophylaxis and Tropical Medicine, University of Vienna. 1987 he went to Brazil working there for the Superintendencia de Campanhas de Saude Publica at Rio Branco. From 1988 to 1996 he held the position of a group leader at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Berlin. 1990 he earned his habilitation for Tropical Medicine and Specific Prophylaxis at the University of Vienna and 1992 an additional habilitation for Tropical Medicine and Parasitology at the Humboldt University of Berlin. 
1992 he started the medical research center in Lambaréné, now Centre de Recherches Médicales de Lambaréné (CERMEL), and made it one of the premier research and training centers in Africa. 1996 Kremsner was appointed Professor for Parasitology at the University of Tübingen. Since 2008 he has been Chairman and Professor for Tropical Medicine, Travel Medicine and Parasitology at Tübingen University as well as Director of the Institute for Tropical Medicine. In 2014 he was additionally appointed CEO of the Comprehensive Infectious Disease Center of University Hospital Tübingen. 2016 he became also Adjunct Professor at the Medical University of Vienna.
Research.
Kremsner led numerous studies on tropical infectious diseases and is author of more than 600 scientific publications. Since 20 years he is one of the most cited scientists in the field of parasitology and malaria in Europe and worldwide. He has been principal investigator on key studies for the development of atovaquone/proguanil, artesunate/amodiaquine, artesunate/pyronaridine and parenteral artesunate for malaria therapy and prophylaxis. 
Kremsner and his team developed a simplified method for assessment of severity of malaria. Outcome can now be predicted and therapy focused by health care providers using the "Lambaréné Score", which uses two clinical characteristics, coma and deep breathing without laboratory assessment. This was accomplished by using data from a study in 26,000 children with severe malaria in Africa led by him. 
Kremsner took part in the phase 3 testing of the malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01, as a member of the governing clinical trial partnership committee and coordinator of clinical trials in Lambaréné. Since 2011, he and his team are working on development of other malaria vaccines, notably PfSPZ-based vaccines in cooperation with Sanaria Inc. A study carried out by his team in Tübingen of a PfSPZ vaccine showed 100 percent protection, a level consistent with WHO guidelines for worldwide use. Kremsner and his teams in Tübingen and Lambaréné also established a Plasmodium falciparum controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) model. Use of this CHMI model dramatically reduces the time needed for clinical development of malaria vaccine and drug candidates.
Private life.
Kremsner is married to the lawyer Inge Thomforde. They have three children (Helene, Gottfried and Ferdinand). He is interested in classical music, arts and literature.
In addition to his citizenship of the European Union (Austrian), Kremsner is also a Gabonese citizen.

Enrique Cárdenas González

Enrique Cárdenas González (February 4, 1927 – March 1, 2018) was a Mexican politician and a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He served as Governor of Tamaulipas from 1975 to 1981 and Municipal President of Ciudad Victoria from 1968 until 1971. Nationally, Cárdenas served in the Senate of the Republic for two terms, as well as Undersecretary of Finance during the administration of President Luis Echeverría during the 1970s.
Life.
Cárdenas was born in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, on February 4, 1927. In the 1950s, he began his business career selling cars in Tampico and later moved to Matamoros, where he sold and repaired farm implements.
His brother Jorge started a radio station, XEGW, in Ciudad Victoria in 1957. Ultimately, after working as one of its sales agents, Enrique acquired XEGW from his brother. In 1969, Cárdenas started Organización Radiofónica Tamaulipeca, which continues to operate radio stations in Ciudad Victoria and Ciudad Mante. Separately from ORT, he also was the original owner of XEIR radio in Ciudad Valles, San Luis Potosí.
In 1963, Cárdenas entered politics. His cousin, Morelos Jaime Canseco González, was critical in promoting him to the head of the state electoral commission. When Gustavo Díaz Ordaz left the Federal Electoral Commission to run for president, Luis Echeverría took his place, starting a friendship that would catalyze Cárdenas's political career. In 1968, with Echeverría as Secretary of the Interior, he intervened to have Cárdenas be named the mayor of Ciudad Victoria. However, he would only serve in that post for a year before being named to the first of two Senate stints.
Cárdenas promoted Tamaulipas's agricultural sector during his tenure as governor from 1975 to 1981 through his program called "Revolución Verde", or Green Revolution. The initiative led to the modernization of Tamaulipas's agriculture industry, including an increase in land clearing and tillage for farming. Tamaulipas became known as one of the "granaries of Mexico" as a result of the state programs.
Enrique Cárdenas died at his home in Ciudad Victoria at 3:00 a.m. on March 1, 2018, at the age of 91. He was survived by his wife, Bertha del Avellano, the former First Lady of Tamaulipas, and their five children - Laura, José, Enrique Cárdenas del Avellano (PRI politician), Eduardo, and Alejandro.

Blyew v. United States

Blyew v. United States was a case heard before the U.S. Supreme Court in April 1872 addressing the civil rights of African Americans, as well as states' rights issues. The case involved the testimony of African American victims of an attack by two White people using an axe that left four people dead. Kentucky state law prohibited the testimony of a "Negro" against a white man and barred African Americans from serving on juries. 
The case was eventually moved to Federal court, where the attackers were convicted. The State of Kentucky then appealed the case to the Supreme Court citing states rights in defense of its laws prohibiting African Americans from testifying against Whites. The case was a test of the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The Supreme Court ruled that victims were not entitled to protection from the state law because word "affected" in the law did not apply to victims of crimes who are not defendants in a case. Noah Swayne (the first Republican appointed to the Supreme Court) and Joseph Bradley dissented. 
The civil rights legislation was subsequently modified and comments in the dissent are noted for putting forth a group right to the adequate protection of the law. Justice William Strong wrote that any case involving an African American witness could be brought to a Federal Court if the court had ruled for the victims and upheld the right of African Americans to testify in court.

Julia Hülsmann

Julia Hülsmann (born 17 July 1968 in Bonn, Germany) is a German jazz pianist and composer. Her compositions are often based on literary works, especially poetry.
Biography.
Hülsmann received music lessons from the age of eleven, and like both of her parents, she plays the piano. As a teenager, she heard a lot of pop music, with particular songwriters like Sting or Randy Newman impressed her. Mediated by her piano teacher, she heard and played music by Chick Corea, Bill Evans, Michael Brecker and Miles Davis.
During her schooldays, she played keyboards and piano in various ensemble instrumentations. After a short period in Frankfurt am Main she moved to Berlin. She was trained as a piano teacher and earned a degree in jazz piano at the Berlin University of the Arts in 1991. Her teachers include Walter Norris, Aki Takase and David Friedman. In particular, she was inspired and influenced by US pianist and composer Don Grolnick. In 1992, Hülsmann joined the Federal Youth Jazz Orchestra, then directed by Peter Herbolzheimer. After graduating in 1996, together with bassist Marc Muellbauer and drummer Rainer Winch she founded the "Julia Hülsmann Trio". The trio played music, initially borrowed mainly from the standard repertoire of jazz, at various festivals and smaller tours. In early 2000, Hülsmann took lessons while studying in New York with Richie Beirach, Maria Schneider, Gil Goldstein and Jane Ira Bloom.
At a concert by Wolfgang Muthspiel she got to know the Norwegian singer Rebekka Bakken. Hülsmann began writing or composing for Bakken and released her debut CD "Trio".at the end of 2000 with her trio. After writing some compositions, the difficult path to finding suitable lyrics for the vocal project began. She eventually discovered the poet E. E. Cummings. She won Bakken for her project, and in 2003 the album "Scattering Poems" appeared. It was several weeks in the German Top 10 jazz releases.
Hülsmanns 's next project was a hommage to the American songwriter Randy Newman. She rearranged several of his songs. At the suggestion of bassist Dieter Ilg, Hülsmann invited the Italian singer Anna Lauvergnac, who also performed with the Vienna Art Orchestra, among others. In 2004, the edited pieces were released on the ACT label on the album "Come Closer".
In her subsequent project Hülsmann worked together with the singer Roger Cicero. Once again she was inspired by poems in her compositions; this time from the pen of the American poet Emily Dickinson, and the album "Good Morning Midnight" was released in 2006. With her trio in the cast with bassist Marc Muellbauer and drummer Heinrich Köbberling, she recorded the album "The End of a Summer" exclusively with her own compositions (released in 2008 on the label ECM). In addition to her own trio Hülsmann also appeared as a pianist in the "United Women’s Orchestra", as a guest musician with Judy Niemack, in the quintet of Meike Goosmann or as a duo with Angelika Niescier.
Since 2001 she also has a teaching assignment at the Berlin University of the Arts and holds composition workshops at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater in Hannover. From 2012 until the end of 2013 she was the chairman of the Union of German Jazz Musicians. As the successor to Michael Schiefel, she was able to give impulses to the music scene Moers throughout the year 2014, as an "improviser in residence".
Honors.
The album "Scattering Poems" has received the gold "German Jazz Award".
In 2008 the trio of Hülsmann received the "Jazzpott" of the poster art Hof Rüttenscheid in Essen. In April 2010 she was invited to the (third) German Jazz Meeting with her trio. As co-initiator of the 2012 founding of the "Union Deutscher Jazzmusiker" erhielt sie 2016 den Ehrenpreis des WDR Jazzpreis. She was awarded the Honorary Prize of the 2016 WDR Jazz Prize. In addition, she received the SWR Jazz Prize as a musician, "which gives jazz in Europe pioneering impulses" the same year.

Grünau Cross–Berlin Brandenburg Airport railway

The Grünau Cross–Berlin Brandenburg Airport railway is a railway line in the south of Berlin, the capital of Germany, and in the adjacent areas of Brandenburg. It is used by the Berlin S-Bahn. The first, section was opened in 1962 and served mainly as a connection to Berlin Schönefeld Airport and the associated long-distance station. In 2011, a extension went into operation to connect with Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER).
History.
The only railway between the radial Berlin–Dresden and Berlin–Görlitz railways until the 1930s was the Neukölln-Mittenwalde Railway, which was also a radial line. The latter also served the village of Schönefeld. Plans for a tangential connection with Berlin's developing railway bypass had been developed for several decades, but they were only actually realised west of the Berlin–Halle railway ("Anhalter Bahn"). During the Nazi period, the Outer Freight Ring ("Güteraußenring", GAR) was built to a temporary low standard; this ran in the area of the southern Berlin city boundary from the Berlin–Halle railway to the east. After the Second World War, passenger traffic ran briefly between Berlin-Grünau and Lichtenrade via Schönefeld and later, between 1955 and 1958, passenger traffic ran again from Grünau to Großziethen.
As a result of the divisions of Germany and Berlin, through rail traffic between most of the surrounding areas and West Berlin (with the exception of the S-Bahn) was cut off in the early 1950s. The traffic ran from the southern radial lines over the beginning of the Berlin outer ring ("Berliner Außenring", BAR), which was built in the eastern part of Berlin in the 1950s. Since it was still possible to move largely unhindered between the eastern and western parts of the city, control stations were also set up at the borders between East Berlin and the surrounding area where passengers were checked before they travelled to Berlin. Such a control station was also built in Schönefeld. The station did not serve public transport, but travellers passing through Berlin-Schönefeld Airport, which was opened for civil use in 1955, could use the trains stopping there.
In order to improve access to the airport, an S-Bahn line was planned to the airport as early as 1958. There were also considerations of extending the line to the west to Rangsdorf or along the BAR to Ludwigsfelde. The construction of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961 made a railway connection even more urgent. Travellers from the areas to the south of Berlin would be able to change to the S-Bahn in Schönefeld. So soon afterwards work started on the construction of the line.
S-Bahn line to Schönefeld Airport.
Work on the line began at the end of September 1961. A second track was built between Altglienicke and Schoenefeld (except under the Waltersdorfer Chaussee underpass) and the infrastructure in the Altglienicke area had to be rebuilt so that an approach road to an expressway could be built next to the railway. The Germanenstraße road bridge was demolished and replaced by a pedestrian bridge with platform access. Grünbergallee station (originally planned with the name of "Falkenhöhe") was rebuilt and the former halt of Schönefeld Siedlung on the Outer Freight Ring was closed. The facilities of Schoenefeld station, now serviced by ordinary public transport services, were extended slightly. A new S-Bahn platform and a pedestrian bridge were built and a station building was built in 1962. Nevertheless, the station remained provisional for a long time.
The line went into operation on 26 February 1962, but Grünbergallee station did not open until 27 May 1962. A possible extension of the S-Bahn along the outer ring towards Wuhlheide was prepared at the Grünau Cross (Grünauer Kreuz), where the BAR crosses the Berlin–Görlitz railway. The power supply of the line was built with a provisional substation at Grünau Cross, which was later replaced by a new building.
From 1985 to 1987, the section between Grünau Cross and Altglienicke was upgraded to two tracks. This increased the efficiency of the line. The ultimate goal was to allow a third group of services (i.e., three trains per direction at 20-minute intervals) to better serve the new development areas in the Altglienicke area. However, this increase in services did not occur. The last single-track section under the Waltersdorfer Chaussee bridge was eliminated in 1991.
Extension to Berlin-Brandenburg Airport.
In the 1990s, the Schönefeld area was chosen when the location of a new major airport for Berlin was examined. An area in the southern part of the existing airport was chosen as the location for the new terminal building. Various concepts for its connection to Berlin were investigated. Two options for an S-Bahn connection were favoured: on the one hand, an underground connection from the existing Schönefeld station under the runway and, on the other hand, an east-west connection from Blankenfelde station on the Dresden Railway through the airport station and continuing to the Görlitz Railway.
Neither of these options were chosen. Instead, a connection was built that runs around the airport from the old Schönefeld station in a large loop to the north and then reaches the new airport station in a tunnel from the west together with the mainline railway. It uses two tracks of the four tracks of the Berlin outer ring that were built in the 1980s but were no longer needed due to falling freight traffic and changed traffic flows to Berlin since reunification. Originally, no intermediate station was planned, but the community of Schönefeld financed the construction of Waßmannsdorf station. The new line and a long-distance railway have been in operation since 31 October 2011. Originally the Berlin-Brandenburg Airport was supposed to begin operations on the same day. However, there have been extensive delays to its construction. It is now not expected to be open before the Autumn of 2020. After January 2012, route training for train drivers was carried out on the new line, but these were stopped when the opening of the airport was delayed. However, trips are still being made to keep the line operational and to ventilate the underground airport station.
Passenger services.
Shortly after the opening of the line, it was operated with two S-Bahn train groups, that is two trains per direction at 20-minute intervals. In 1962, the Bernau – central Schönefeld airport train group (running during the whole operating day) and the Friedrichstrasse – Schönefeld train group (not running during the evening) served the line. A few years later, the latter train group operated during the entire operating time to/from the Berlin Stadtbahn. Since then, it has been the main train group on the line. In 1990, it was extended in the western part of the city to Charlottenburg and sometimes to Westkreuz. Since 1991, it has carried the line number of S9. Because of the construction work at Ostkreuz, it has not run on the Stadtbahn since 2009, but instead runs to Pankow or Blankenburg, but after the completion of the connection curve, services will return to the Stadtbahn.
The second train group to Schönefeld has changed several times. For a long time there were continuous connections between Schönefeld and Oranienburg. Since the end of 2002, the S 45 line has been operating from Schönefeld via Baumschulenweg to the southern Ringbahn. The terminus of the line (as of 2016) is generally Südkreuz, with some trains continuing Bundesplatz. These two services are to run on the line after completion of the new airport and then terminate at Berlin Brandenburg Airport station.
Route.
The line starts in Grünau Cross, where the Berlin outer ring crosses the Berlin–Görlitz railway. The many connecting curves allow trains to operate in all directions. For the S-Bahn, the only branch in this area is the separation of the line to the airport from the S-Bahn line along the Görlitz Railway towards Grünau and Königs Wusterhausen. The line to the airport turns to the southwest and initially uses the former route of the Outer Freight Ring. Altglienicke station is located, together with a feeder road to an autobahn, in a cutting between the districts of Altglienicke and Bohnsdorf. The line runs to the west and reaches Grünbergallee station. On the same street there is one of the few level crossings on the Berlin S-Bahn network.
The line crosses the Berlin city limits and again meets the Berlin outer ring. Berlin Schönefeld Airport station has an island platform for the S-Bahn with two S-Bahn tracks; it formerly had three island platforms for mainline services. Originally, no extension of the S-Bahn line was planned. Therefore, the extension of the S-Bahn line continues on the axis of the former long-distance tracks from the southern island platform, which was therefore taken out of service. The outer ring had been four-tracked in this area in the 1980s. The new S-Bahn line uses the two southern tracks of the outer ring. It follows the ring for several kilometres and turns to the south in Waßmannsdorf and runs into Waßmannsdorf station, which is built on an embankment. At Selchow the line meets the long-distance tracks of the Glasower Damm Ost–Bohnsdorf Süd railway and they run together initially in a trough, then through a several kilometre-long tunnel to the east and then northeast to Berlin Brandenburg Airport. This is where the S-Bahn line ends, while the long-distance train tracks continue to the Görlitz Railway. The airport station is only about in a direct line from Schönefeld station, while the S-Bahn line between the two stations is long.
With the construction of the extension of the line, a new turnback facility was built in Schönefeld station. There is no turnback facility in the new airport station, so trains reverse at the platform. The airport station is controlled by a computer-based interlocking in Selchow.

Fortunatianus of Aquileia

Fortunatianus of Aquileia, bishop of Aquileia in the mid fourth century A.D, according to Jerome of (North) African origin (De vir. ill. 97), was the author of apparently the oldest surviving Western commentary on the Gospels, hitherto known from a few excerpts (two identified by Wilmart from a Troyes manuscript and another by Bischoff from Angers) and a reference in Jerome's correspondence (thus predating Hilary on St. Matthew); in 2012, his commentary was identified by the editor Lukas Dorfbauer in a ninth-century manuscript from the library of Cologne Cathedral.
Fortunatianus may have eventually inclined to anti-Nicene doctrine but at l.984-6 the text clearly states the Trinity as being of one substance. He also admitted a large figurative element in the Gospel narratives. (An example: l.499 seq. Fortunatianus' treatment of the Magi "returning by another way.") An interesting detail is his identification of two of the four Evangelists based on Ezekiel and the Apocalypse at the opening of his text: Mark is the eagle and John the lion.
Fortunatianus was a signatory at the western Council of Serdica (343) which condemned Arius' teaching; he subsequently entertained Athanasius on his return journey from Treves to Alexandria, and was chosen by Pope Liberius to defend Athanasius at the Council of Milan (355) where however he yielded, doubtless with good grace, to pressure from Emperor Constantius II; in the aftermath of the council he urged Pope Liberius to conform.

Richard O. Culver Jr.

Richard O. "Dick" Culver Jr. (April 9, 1936 – February 24, 2014) was a decorated United States Marine Corps officer who was one of the founders of the Marine Corps Scout Sniper School in Quantico, Virginia. Culver served in combat in Vietnam and was awarded the Silver Star for his heroic actions during a firefight in 1967.
Early years.
Richard Otis Culver Jr. was born on Alcatraz Island on April 9, 1936. His father, Richard O. Culver, was a guard at the Federal Penitentiary there and the family lived on the island. Richard Jr. was the first child born on the island while it was a Federal Penitentiary. His father was a retired Marine Corps lieutenant colonel who had served in the Banana Wars and in China.
Culver's family moved to Hopewell, Virginia, where he attended elementary school and completed his high school education.
Culver enlisted in the Marine Corps at age 17. He graduated from high school in 1954 and then attended Virginia Military Institute (VMI), where he was a member of the Marine Corps Reserves. While at VMI, he competed as captain of the VMI Pistol team, and on the Marine Corps Reserve Rifle and Pistol team at the National Matches. He earned his bachelor's degree in physics in 1958. He later earned a master's degree in physics.
Marine Corps service.
Culver enlisted into active service in the US Marine Corps on November 11, 1958. He subsequently attended Officer Candidate School (OCS) and was commissioned as a Marine Corps second lieutenant.
Vietnam War.
Culver served two combat tours in Vietnam. In his first tour, from 1967 to 1968, he was wounded on his first day in combat and awarded the Purple Heart. After recovering, he led reconnaissance patrols. He then saw combat experience with the infantry, where he served as a company commander. While serving as the commanding officer of H Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, in Vietnam, Culver was awarded the Silver Star for his actions on July 21, 1967, during a firefight with a North Vietnamese Army company. As described in his obituary, he "exposed himself to fire several times, rallied his Marines, coordinated fire and medevacs, called in artillery and air support, and forced the enemy to break contact after suffering numerous casualties".
Culver had a second tour to Vietnam from 1971 to 1972.
Sniper school.
After the Vietnam War, the Marine Corps moved forward with forming a permanent Scout Sniper program. Together with Major Edward James Land (who was Culver's commanding officer in Vietnam), Culver helped form, and was the first commander of, the first Marine Corps Scout Sniper School at Quantico, Virginia. Culver's senior NCO was GySgt Carlos Hathcock.
Culver was a member and later commanding officer of the Marine Corps Rifle and Pistol team, earning several medals in competition.
Silver Star citation.
For heroism in combat on July 21, 1967, when a Captain in the United States Marine Corps, in Company H, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade:
The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain Richard O. Culver, Jr. (MCSN: 0-75696), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as the Commanding Officer of Company H, Second Battalion, Third Marines, Ninth Marine Amphibious Brigade, in the Republic of Vietnam on 21 July 1967. While engaged in a company-size search and destroy mission near the village of Ap Sieu Quan during Operation BEAR CHAIN, Captain Culver had established a defensive perimeter outside the village and had deployed one platoon to search the area when the entire company came under intense small arms and automatic weapons fire form an estimated North Vietnamese Army company firing from entrenched, heavily-fortified positions and sustained several casualties. Reacting immediately, he displayed exceptional courage and leadership as he exposed himself to hostile fire to move forward to a vantage point where he could more advantageously observe the action and direct the fire and movement of his men. He found that the Marines were temporarily pinned down by fire being delivered from a tree line 300 meters distant from his defensive perimeter and from positions within the village. Exhibiting an extensive knowledge of tactics, Captain Culver quickly consolidated his position, established a base of fire to cover the evacuation of the wounded and maneuvered the search platoon back to the perimeter. He then called for gunship, fixed wing and artillery support. Completely disregarding his own safety, he repeatedly moved about the perimeter in the face of heavy North Vietnamese fire to encourage his men, ensure the security of each firing position and direct he fire of the company mortars. When the gunships arrived, Captain Culver accurately directed their fire against hostile positions seventy-five meters from the front elements of his unit. Oblivious to the danger to his own life, he continued to expose himself to North Vietnamese fire to adjust rocket fire on other enemy positions. After the fixed wing aircraft arrived, he skillfully adjusted their runs directly on top of the enemy bunkers and trench lines. When all the aircraft had expended their ordnance and departed, Captain Culver called in heavy artillery and accurately adjusted their fire. Establishing a well-integrated night defensive perimeter, he was able to provide security not only for his company but also for 250 refugees who had fled to the Marines for protection. Leading a coordinated two-platoon attack against the enemy the following morning, he found that the North Vietnamese had been successfully routed and had left five dead, one rifle, several grenades, demolitions and numerous pieces of equipment.

Siata 208S

The Siata 208S (Sport) is an Italian sports car produced by Siata. Presented in 1952, the 208 Sport wore a lightweight sports spider aluminum body designed by Giovanni Michelotti and built by Rocco Motto. Only 35 208s Spiders were produced, including the two Bertone designed prototypes. It is the roadster counterpart to the Siata 208 CS. 
History.
The car rose to prominence after actor and race car driver Steve McQueen purchased model BS523 from Los Angeles-based Siata importer Ernie McAfee in the mid-1950s. McQueen reportedly rebadged the car with Ferrari emblems and dubbed the car his "Little Ferrari".
Performance.
Mechanically, the 208S was derived partly from the Fiat 8V, with which it shared Fiat's all alloy Tipo 104 70° 2-liter V8 engine. This engine produced 125 hp (93.2 kW) and allowed it to reach a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph). "Road &amp; Track" recorded a 0-60 mph (97 km/h) time of 12.4 seconds and a quarter mile time of 17.8 seconds during its tests. The 208s wore all aluminum bodywork and featured four wheel independent suspension which was advanced for its time.
