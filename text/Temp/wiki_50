Solaristor

A solaristor (from SOLAR cell transISTOR) is a compact two-terminal self-powered phototransistor. The two-in-one transistor plus solar cell achieves the high-low current modulation by a memresistive effect in the flow of photogenerated carriers. The term was coined by Dr Amador Perez-Tomas working in collaboration with other ICN2 researchers in 2018 when they demonstrated the concept in a ferroelectric-oxide/organic bulk heterojunction solar cell.
Principle of operation.
In a basic solaristor embodiment, the self-powered transistor effect is achieved by the integration of a light absorber layer (a material that absorbs photon energy) in series with a functional semiconductor transport layer, which internal conductivity or contact resistance can be modified externally.
Light absorber (solar cell element).
In general, the light absorber is a semiconductor p–n junction that:
Additionally, in thin-film solar cells, buffer electron and hole semiconductor transport layers are introduced at the respective metal electrodes to avoid electron-hole recombination and to remove the metal/absorber Schottky barrier.
Conductivity modulator (transistor element).
A solaristor effect is achieved by modifying the internal field properties or the overall conductivity of the solar cell.
Ferroelectric solaristors. One possibility is the use of ferroelectric semiconductors as transport layers. A ferroelectric layer can be seen as a semiconductor with switchable surface charge polarity. Because of this tuneable dipole effect, ferroelectrics bend their electronic band structure and offsets with respect to adjacent metals and/or semiconductors when switching the ferroelectric polarization so that the overall conductivity can be tuned orders of magnitude.
Two-terminal phototransistors.
Conventional photodiodes or photodetectors do not switch as a phototransistor does when biased through its third terminal (gate). An additional advantage of a solaristor is, therefore, the potential reduction of the standard phototransistor's area and interconnection complexity. By using solaristors, it would be possible in theory to replace the in-plane three-electrode architecture by a vertical, two-electrode photodiode-like architecture in systems like photo-sensors, cameras, or displays.

Raychael Stine

Raychael Stine (born April 19, 1981) is an American painter and educator. She has exhibited nationally and internationally, and is a professor at the University of New Mexico.
Biography.
Raychael Stine was born and spent her early years in Chardon, Ohio. Her family moved briefly to New Jersey before settling in north Texas, where she attended Flower Mound High School. She received her BFA in painting at the University of Texas at Dallas. She received an MFA at the University of Illinois Chicago. She lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where she is Assistant Professor in Painting &amp; Drawing at the University of New Mexico.
Subjects and themes.
Stine is known for her use of dogs as a primary subject of her paintings. About this practice she states, "It's sort of illegal subject matter in the serious contemporary art world because it's really sentimental and soft, and it's not thought of as intellectual or conceptual. But figuring out how to relate to something or understand it physically and visually is like the entire process of a painting."

1896 United States presidential election in Washington (state)

The 1896 United States presidential election in Washington took place on November 3, 1896. All contemporary 45 states were part of the 1896 United States presidential election. State voters chose four electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
Washington was won by the Democratic nominees, former U.S. Representative William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska and his running mate Arthur Sewall of Maine. Two electors cast their Vice Presidential ballots for Thomas E. Watson.
As a result of his win in the state, Bryan would become the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Washington state. He would later lose the state against McKinley in 1900 and then against William Howard Taft in 1908. Bryan would also be the only one to do so until Woodrow Wilson won it in 1916.
This is the last time the loser won a majority of Clallam County votes.

Orianda

Orianda (originally named Ragna IV, also previously known as Sabina) is an Bermudian staysail schooner. It was built in 1937 by C. Andersen, designed by Danish naval architect Oscar W. Dahlstrom. It was used in Denmark during World War II and captured by Germany before being recovered and restored. It is currently used as a charter vessel.
History.
When "Orianda" was purchased in 2009 from the Benlloch family, the history of its origin was little known and incorrect. For many years, it was believed that "Orianda" was commissioned by Christian X, the King of Denmark, or by the Duke of Oresund. The new owners traced the history of the ship back to Carl Andersen and a shipyard in Faaborg which no longer existed. After comparing historic documents and photographs from the era, it was determined that "Orianda" was originally "Ragna IV".
"Ragna IV" was designed by Danish naval architect Oscar W. Dahlstrom. It was originally designed as a racing cruiser in 1937 and was completed by C. Andersen Shipbuilders in Faaborg. The earliest known owner was Ole Sundo according to Lloyd's registry in London in 1939.
The ship was used by Denmark during World War II. It was seized by the Nazi forces during Operation Weserübung and later found abandoned on the shores of Denmark by Baron Johan Otto Raben-Levetzau in 1944. The ship was in disrepair, missing its masts and rigging. Sundo sold it to Baron Raben-Levetzau who restored it at the port of Svendborg. 
In 1952, Raben-Levetzau sailed the ship to Sweden where the hull was painted and the ship re-registered under the name "Sabina" at the Royal Swedish Yachting Club. It was used as a charter in the 1950s until being sold to Stergios C. Souyouldjoglen, the Greek Ambassador to Denmark. It was again sold in 1969, this time to Mr. Draikis of Raleigh Brothers. Ownership changed hands numerous more times under the name "Sabina", until it was renamed and registered in Antigua under the name "Orianda" in 1981. The same year, it was purchased by Neil Peart of the rock band Rush, who wrote about it in his 2011 book "Roadshow".
Peter Phillilps purchased "Orianda" from Peart in 1987. The day after the purchase, the vessel caught fire and damaged most of the boat while anchored in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands. After restoring the boat, Phillips continued to sail it until he sold it to a real estate developer by the name of Benlloch in 1991. The family owned the boat for two decades and even entered it in the Spanish Classic Yacht Regatta in Valencia. The ship was sold in 2009 and completely restored in the Roman shipyard Tecnomar. It is currently operated as a charter boat by The Classic Yacht Experience.

Yeffe Kimball

Yeffe Kimball, born Effie Goodman, (March 30, 1906– April 11, 1978) was an American artist known for her abstract modernist work on Native American culture and space exploration. Kimball created work under an assumed Osage Indian identity, rising to prominence after her admittance of the painting "Sacred Buffalo" into the First Annual Exhibition of American Indian Painting at the Philbrook Art Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1946.
Biography.
Born Effie Violetta Goodman to white parents, Oather Alvis Goodman and Martha Clementine Smith on March 30, 1906, her residence in 1910 was Rayville, Missouri. Kimball claimed to have been born in 1914 in Mountain Park, Oklahoma. Kimball was the fourth of at least nine children. 
Kimball's last name is the result of her first annulled marriage, which likely enabled her to erase her previous identity. Kimball cited a fabricated background of an Osage father known as “Other Good-Man” or “Other Good-Man Smith”, but there are no Osage records that exist to support this claim. Furthermore, there are no reservation records that show any type of Native American ancestry in Kimball's family. This assumed identity and cultural appropriation brought her great success as a Native American artist. Kimball married Harvey L. Slatin, an atomic scientist, in 1948. Slatin's work influenced Kimball's work, evident in her “fused earth” work from the 1960s.
Education and career.
Kimball's work is known for its Western modernist style and focus on Native American subjects and themes. While many mid-20th century American Indian painters used water-based paints, such as casein and distemper, Kimball mostly painted in oil.
Early references claim that Kimball studied at the University of Oklahoma in the 1930s. Lacking sufficient evidence to support this, as the university has no records documenting her attendance, it instead appears that Kimball was a designer for a Kansas City department store before she moved to New York City with her second husband to start her art career in 1935. Kimball studied at the Arts Student League in New York City from 1935 to 1939, traveling abroad to Europe to do independent studies in France and Italy. In Europe, she discovered African art, which influenced her study of Native American painting and traditions.
The national Philbrook Indian Annual exhibition accepted entries from Native Americans all over the United States that created work based on Native themes and drew attention as Native American painting was rising in popularity post-World War II. Kimball's first entry into the exhibition in 1946, "Sacred Buffalo", was accepted into the show, but did not win awards and was not purchased by the museum. Her entry the following year, "To the Happy Hunting Ground", won her an honorable mention in the Plains region category from the juror. This painting cemented Kimball's career in Native art, securing her future entries in the Annual Philbrook exhibition and as a supposed Native artist.
Kimball exhibited work in more than one hundred shows in galleries and museums between 1942 and 1965. Around 60 of the numerous shows she was in over her career were solo exhibitions around the United States and Europe. The National Academy of Design, the Whitney Museum, and the Carnegie Institute, as well as being the first woman to have work displayed in the NASA art collection, are among her major exhibitions in the United States.
Yeffe Kimball established herself as a writer and critic of Native American art. She reviewed the 1946 and 1947 Philbrook Indian Annuals for "Art Digest", a New York Publication. Kimball also illustrated "The Story of the Totem Pole" in 1949 and "The Pueblo Indians in Story, Song, and Dance" in 1955, both children's books focused on Indian legends. In 1965, she co-authored and illustrated a cookbook with Jean Anderson titled "The Art of American Indian Cooking".
Native American advocacy.
Kimball was engaged in Native American political activism in the later part of her life, working on Native-run committees for the Department of the Interior that supported political, educational, and cultural Native American groups throughout the 1950s up until the late 1970s. Kimball organized art auctions to raise money for Native American causes, and worked with the U.S. State Department to choose objects that were displayed in an international exhibition of Native American art in 1953. Several of the organizations she worked for and founded, such as Arrow, worked to support Native American youth, education, arts, and health.
Death and legacy.
Kimball died in her vacation home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on April 11, 1978, from cancer.
Much of Kimball's work is now housed in publicly funded institutions, further complicating the significance and historical meaning and value of her artwork. The Department of the Interior with which she worked for collected ninety-five of her pieces, including paintings, prints, and drawings, along with some of her other personal Native American and art-related belongings. Other artwork was donated to or given by Kimball to the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe. This institution collected nine of her paintings along with a large sum of ethnographic photographs that she took in the 1950s.
Kimball's self-identification as an Osage Indian raises many questions as to why she would adopt a minority identity. At the time Kimball began making art under the Native American category, in the late 1930s, there was not only a large market for Native American art but also different understandings of cultural identities. The lack of knowledge at the time allowed Kimball, along with many other “counterfeit Indians”, to pass as Native American. In addition, the art world at the time was a male-dominated field, making it difficult or often impossible for a woman's career to develop. Bill Anthes state's, “indeed, Indianness provided Kimball with a position of strength on which to build a career, and she styled herself as the exotic curiosity of being an Indian in New York as well as a rising star in the Indian exhibitions of the West”. Her fabricated identity was and is still widely believed to be true and cited by both Native and non-Native audiences. Some in the postwar Native American art world were aware of Kimball's charade, such as Frederick J. Dockstader, director of the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. Despite knowing this, he and a few others felt that Kimball's dedication to Native American rights and advocacy justified her false identity, because it indicated her sincere connection to Indian culture, unparalleled by others falsely claiming to be Native American in the twentieth-century.

Jane Maria Bowkett

Jane Maria Bowkett (1837–1891) was a British traditional Victorian genre painter who worked primarily in oils. Her work has been described as 'delightful, slightly naive pictures of women and children, either interiors, or often beach scenes'. She managed, however, to establish a successful career as a professional artist in a male dominated occupation. It has been suggested that in some paintings, she created scenes that were ambiguous by refusing to depict women as models of moral virtue, and depicting mothers and children as being content regardless of a male presence. It is also suggested that the painting "Young Lady in a Conservatory" makes social commentary on the moral restrictions placed upon women as the subject is seen in a small conservatory with minimal room to move.
Biography and career.
Born in London, Jane Maria Bowkett was the eldest of thirteen siblings. Many of her sisters became artists as well. Her father, Thomas Bowkett, was a medical practitioner and was active in the Chartist Movement. In 1862 J. M. Bowkett married the artist Charles Stuart, but continued to sign her work using her maiden name. She gave birth to six children, only three of which survived childbirth. The family, however, subsequently prospered, and in the mid 1880s Bowkett and her husband finally purchased an impressive newly built property in Hampstead with a huge galleried studio connected to the spacious house by a barrel-vaulted conservatory. She lived in this home until her death in 1891.
When Bowkett was first training to paint she attended a government-run school of design in London. Bowkett worked primarily in oils in which she often painted everyday domestic and genre scenes. She had a successful career. Her exhibition record started in 1858 with "Angels Heads after Joshua Reynolds" at the Society of Female Artists (later the Society of Women Artists). In 1860, she made her debut at the British Institution with "Put your finger in the foxhole". This was sold for 3 guineas. Her last painting was exhibited at the Royal Hibernian Academy ("The Bailiff's Daughter of Islington") in 1891. The price was £35. During the intervening years she exhibited over 120 paintings at these and many other galleries such as Society of British Artists (RBA), Royal Scottish Academy, Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts, Walker Art Gallery, Manchester Art Gallery, Royal Institute of Oil Painters. High prices could be achieved for her work; for instance, at the RBA in 1875 "On the Sands at Shanklin, Isle of Wight" sold for £157.10s. She also had four exhibits at the Royal Academy; one in 1861 ("Preparing for dinner"), two in 1881 ("Ophelia" and "Four miles more") and one in 1882 ("Sally in our Alley", etc.).
Feminist interpretation of Bowkett's work.
An example of Bowkett's work which has been subject to feminist interpretation is "Preparing Tea" (or "Time for tea" as it had been retitled when sold for £2000 at Christie's South Kensington on 16 March 2011). This painting shows a woman, presumably a wife and mother, spreading jam on toast as she gazes out the window while one of her children is toasting bread by a fire and the other child is carrying a pair of men's slippers. It has been suggested that Bowkett leaves some ambiguity in the facial expression of the mother as she sees her husband's train approaching in the distance. And that this piece depicted the ability of women and children alike to be happy without having to rely on a male presence. This critic also suggests that Bowkett's work combined concepts of everyday life, idealized domestic scenes, and ideals of motherhood in which she refused to depict women as being models of domestic virtue. This interpretation is suggested to be demonstrated in some of her other works where Bowkett depicts women bothering themselves with their home duties and not fulfilling expectations that were set for them. The critic concludes that by disrupting the interaction between form and content, Bowkett is able to leave moral ambiguity in her work.Comparing Bowkett’s ‘Preparing Tea’ with her similar painting ‘Looking out for Papa’ tends to argue against a consistent ambiguity in her work suggested by the critic. The latter painting’s title and content seems to indicate an unambiguous welcome for the imminent arrival of ‘Papa’.
It has been suggested that Bowkett saw conservatories as a form of artificial paradise. The painting "Young Lady in a Conservatory" (1870-1880) depicts a young woman in a conservatory tending to a lily in a large pot. Around her are various other plants such as fuchsias, pelargoniums, and ferns. It has been further suggested that this work depicts a sense of enclosure and makes social commentary about the moral restrictions set out for middle class women at this time (1870-1880) and that the protruding stamens on the lily add a reference to a sexual awakening which ties back to the concepts of moral restrictions.

<doc id="56930864" url="?curid=56930864" title="School choice in Pennsylvania">
School choice in Pennsylvania

The Pennsylvania school code, section 1327, policy for school choice is, “...to preserve the primary right and obligation of the parent or parents, or person or persons in loco parentis to a child, to choose the education and training for such child.”
Origins in the United States.
The origins of school choice can be traced to a 1955 proposal by the prominent economist and Nobel laureate Milton Friedman who suggested that America's public school system could be improved through free market principles. Friedman proposed giving parents the opportunity to use state and local funds, otherwise designated for local school districts, in the form of vouchers to attend other private or public institutions.
Forms of School Choice in Pennsylvania.
Educational Tax Credit.
Pennsylvania became the first state to pass an education tax credit targeted at corporations. This legislation came on May 7, 2001 and was passed with overwhelming bi-partisan support. Pennsylvania's Educational Improvement Tax Credit, known as EITC, allows companies a 75 percent tax credit for donations made to non-profit scholarships or educational improvement organizations. If the company makes the same donation over a two-year commitment, the tax credit increases to 90 percent. The tax credits are capped at $750,000 annually or $200,000 for pre-k donations.
Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credits.
The Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit Program or OSTC provides tax credits to eligible businesses that contribute to an Opportunity Scholarship Organization. These funds are used to provide scholarships to eligible elementary or secondary school students enrolled in “low-achieving” schools. These funds may be used to pay tuition to another public or private school. Low achieving schools are defined as being ranked among the bottom 15 percent based on combined math and reading scores from the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA).
Charter schools.
Pennsylvania enacted Act 22 in 1997 during Governor Ridge's administration. This bipartisan legislation authorized the establishment of charter schools within the Commonwealth. There are currently 135 charter schools operating in Pennsylvania. Over 50,000 students are enrolled in these schools.
Cyber Charter Schools.
Last year, 32,958 students were enrolled in cyber charter schools throughout Pennsylvania. That number signifies about 2 per cent of PA's overall public school enrollment. Advocates for cyber charters like the routine contact with instructors and the increased instruction time that online education offers.
Inter-district Choice.
In Pennsylvania's Chester Upland School District, officials have been forced to look to surrounding Delaware County schools, since there are no other eligible schools within the district. However, such instances are problematic, because outlying schools are not always eager to accept students from low performing school districts. Although open enrollment is not mandated in Pennsylvania, the state's Department of Education encourages school districts to work together on the matter.
Recent Legislative Reform Measures.
In October 2017 Pennsylvania State Senator John DiSanto, a Republican from Dauphin County proposed legislation for Educational Savings Accounts (ESA). This legislation would have allowed families of children attending public schools which are performing in the bottom 15 per cent to state-funded education savings accounts. A vote on this new legislation was postponed by the PA Senate Education Committee in December 2017. It also failed to get out of committee in October with a 6-6 deadlock vote.
Support.
Supporters of school choice in Pennsylvania cite the fact that educational choice gives parents greater flexibility to choose the right educational environment for their children regardless of the location of their home school districts. This alternative education comes at lower costs than traditional public schooling. Pennsylvania has been describes as being the “envy of choice advocates across the country” for its pioneer legislation that has given the Commonwealth's families such flexibility.
Opposition.
School choice has received vehement opposition since its inception and during its considerable recent growth. Opponents claim that school choice options take money away from public school systems, many of which are located within financially stressed and academically failing areas. Critics, such as PA State Auditor General Eugene DePasquale, have called for an overhaul of legislation to bring greater financial and educational oversight.
Public School Response.
Faced with tight educational budgets and declining enrollments, some public school systems in the Commonwealth have made innovative curriculum changes to keep pace with school choice options. Keystone School District implemented a greater focus on digital technologies to be competitive. This district not only revised traditional courses, but also instituted on-line courses in advanced placement and dual enrollment classes, in addition to a hybrid curriculum and an aggressive outreach campaign to boost enrollment. The Quakertown Community School District not only implemented an online learning program, but also a performing arts program that includes theater and a dance studio that has drastically reduced its annual tuition reimbursement rates.

Villa Heights Plantation

Villa Heights Plantation was originally the home of Lt. Colonel Elijah McClanahan in Roanoke, Virginia. Built in 1820, it has been substantially renovated and restored over the years, and has been known as "Long Meadow", "Villa Heights" and "The Compton-Bateman House". The familiar name, "Villa Heights", was also the origin of the neighborhood name of Villa Heights, Roanoke, Virginia. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.
Elijah McClanahan.
Elijah McClanahan (April 20, 1770 died 1857) built this home in 1820. "Built in 1820, the house was owned by Lt. Col. Elijah McClanahan, a War of 1812 veteran. The original Federal architecture was renovated in the early 20th century with Classical revival features on the interior and exterior and has been known as the Compton-Bateman house." This property was later to be known as part of the Villa Heights neighborhood in Roanoke, Virginia. Originally named "Long Meadow" by Col. McClanahan, over the years the name of the house was known as "Villa Heights", from which the neighborhood was named, to the Compton-Bateman house, as it is locally known today.
"The original dwelling of Villa Heights, built by Elijah McClanahan in 1820, was a comparatively modest Federal style house, compared to its 20th century evolution. However, it was still quite a substantial house for this area during the second quarter of the nineteenth century and, compared to most of the surrounding farmsteads of the time, would have been an iconic and impressive building. Character-defining features of its original Federal design included unpainted Flemish bond, load-bearing brick construction, a molded brick water table, and a five-bay facade with symmetrical fenestration and stone window sills. Today the façade also features Classical Revival detailing around the entry, notably a round-arched opening with a fanlight transom and
five-light sidelights, but it is undetermined as of yet if these were part of the original design or if they were added in a later alteration."
McClanahan was a substantial landowner of the region, and this was his main plantation house. The house later on passed to the Langhorne family.
Compton family.
Originally a simple two-story brick structure, Greek revival elements were added by the Compton family in the early 20th century. The Compton family sold the building to the city of Roanoke in 1958, and it remained a recreational center until it was closed in 1999."The last family that owned it, the Batemans, deeded it to the city in 1958."
Recreation center.
"The mansion served as a city recreation center from the late 1950s until 2007 and was damaged by a fire in 2011." The house had also been used as a satellite office for the Roanoke City Police force.
2011 fire.
There was a fire in the house in 2011, that caused about $600,000.00 worth of damage. The insurance will only cover $500,000.00, and so the city in is straits of what to do about the property. The fire severely damaged the roof. It burned so completely, there was little left of the roofing frame to attach tarps or other protective fabrics onto the house.
In spite of the fire, the home was added to the Virginia endangered landmarks list in 2013. "The Compton-Bateman House in Roanoke, also known as the Villa Heights Recreation Center. It was badly damaged in a fire and will not survive long without immediate attention. It's one of the few remaining antebellum houses in the city."

Gerard Valcin

Gerard Valcin (1923-1988) was a self taught, Haitian painter who is known most commonly for his work depicting Vodou rituals and the labors of everyday Haitian life.
Biography.
Gerard Valcin was born in 1923 in Haiti. Valcin was born into a very poor family and his parents couldn't pay for him to receive an education. He was in school for only 3 years until he quit to make money weaving twine for hats as a young boy. He only earned two cents for every three yards of wine he weaved; he then worked as a tile setter for twelve years. "Profits from the tile work allowed me to paint." – Gerard Valcin.
Vulcan received no formal training in painting of any art form. However, as a young boy, Valcin would watch a man in his neighborhood paint Vodou Spirits on pieces of cardboard in his front yard. The paint was made from limes, eggs, bark and homemade rum. After seeing this, he started painting himself with similar homemade paints. He began painting from his spiritual imagination – influenced by country life and the blending of Vodou and Masonic Masonry. However, most of his work comes from the inspiration of Vodou Spirits, beliefs, and ceremonies. While working as a tile setter, he met a group of painters who were using real, store bought, paints. "I saw them pressing a tube. I didn't know what it was. I thought it was toothpaste." – Gerard Valcin.
In 1947, Valcin brought one of his paintings to the Centre d'Arte in Port-au-Prince. Dwight Peters, the director of the Centre d'Arte, was scouting just such untrained artists and wanted to nurture their work. In 1950, Valcin official started the Centre d'Arte. Peters provided Valcin, and other such artists, with supplies and space to exhibit and sell their work. Gerard Valcin died in 1988. He was an important figure in the second generation of Haitian painters. "Painting, rum, music, work, and nothing else." – Gerard Valcin.

Stark Mountain (also known as General Stark Mountain) is a mountain in the Green Mountains in the U.S. state of Vermont. Located in the town of Fayston in Washington County, the mountain summit is in elevation. Stark Mountain is named after General John Stark, hero of the Battle of Bennington fought in 1777.
Drainage basin.
Stark Mountain stands within the watershed of Lake Champlain, which drains into the Richelieu River in Québec, the Saint Lawrence River, and then eventually into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. On the east side of the ridge, Stark Mountain drains into Mill Brook, thence into the Mad River, the Winooski River, and into Lake Champlain. On the west side of the ridge, Stark Mountain drains into the Huntington River and into the Winooski River.
Hiking.
The Long Trail traverses the summit of Stark Mountain, approximately north of Mount Ellen. The closest side trail providing access to this section of the Long Trail is the Jerusalem Trail in Starksboro, Vermont, which is also named after John Stark.
Just east of Camel's Hump State Forest in Starksboro, on the north peak of Stark Mountain at , sits Stark's Nest, a warming hut for winter skiers at the Mad River Glen ski area. In the summer, the hut becomes an overnight lodge for hikers. The hike from Appalachian Gap to Stark's Nest via the Long Trail is with of vertical gain.

Lherison Debrise (also spelled Lherison Debrues/Lherrison Debrues) is a Haitian artist.
Early life.
Debrise was born in Cap Haitian in 1971. At fourteen he followed his mother to the Bel Air area after she left when he was a young child. He lived near a Vodou Priest and flag maker known as Tibout, where he often spent much of his time. He later “began participating in the atelier, which included flag making".
Career.
Debrise began creating his own flags and searching the rural areas for objects he could sell in the Port-au-Prince market. He later combined his business with local sculptors who worked in the Iron Market, acting as an agent for them.
Debrise decorates human skulls with sequins, and decorates them to represent Port-au-Prince. Debrise’ sequins are used in his decoration of Vodou flags.
Debrise’ art is considered “post-Kreyol” or Creole. Kreyol is the culture admitted by French colonies in the Americas. “Kreyol culture is guided by the upper and middle classes of Haiti, classes that Debrise is not from. Kreyol culture in poetry, in music, hide the raw, the gothic, the ‘ugly’ He, on the other hand, brings all of this to his audience, as the truth about Haitian society and especially Haitian imagination.”

Record is the fifth solo studio album by English singer and songwriter Tracey Thorn.

The album released by Merge Records on 2 March 2018 to mostly positive reviews from critics.
Critical reception.
Writing for "Pitchfork", music journalist Laura Snapes described "Record" as "one of the defining albums of [Thorn's] 38-year career", while "Rolling Stone" critic Rob Sheffield said "Thorn's Synth-Pop 'Record' Delivers Sisterly Passion, Wry Wisdom". Robert Christgau wrote in his review for "Vice": "Calm, deliberate, undemonstrative, Thorn is a singer some find magical and others prosaic. I've always tended other, but when a 55-year-old wife and mother claims she's recorded 'nine feminist bangers,' I pay attention. And these definitely work up some fairy dust. The beats evoke without mimicking the subtle electro-dance of Thorn and her beatmaking husband Ben Watt's 20th-century band, Everything but the Girl, and in her undemonstrative way, she sequences the catchiest tracks last ['Face' and 'Dancefloor']".

Early life.
Agathe Aladin was born on May 25, 1967 in Jacmel, one of several children of Haitian painter Theard Aladin. She spent much of her early life watching and helping her father paint. Upon her father's death in 1993, Agathe began her own paintings, following the style of her father. Painting runs in the Aladin family, as her father and his cousins, Prefete Duffaut and Paulesu Vital, were also painters in Haiti. In addition to learning the craft of painting from her father and other family, she studied with Maurice Vital.
Biography.
Aladin paints vodou scenes, family scenes, womanhood scenes, and every day scenes. She is said to call her style of painting "imaginary free." Aladin now lives in Carrefour, Haiti with her husband and three children. Her home was destroyed in the 2010 earthquake, causing Aladin and her family to live for five months under tarps and sheets until tents were provided.
A collection of four oil paintings by Agathe Aladin is held at the Waterloo Center for the Arts, including the oil painting "Music in the Countryside" (1998), which depicts a woman playing an instrument while wearing a purple headdress and is surrounded by an ox, calf, stream, and hills.

Melva Lowe de Goodin

Melva Lowe de Goodin (born 1945) is an Afro-Panamanian academic and writer, whose work has focused on adding back the historical contributions of Panama's Afro-Caribbean people. Educated in the United States, she began her teaching career in Africa and upon returning to Panama recognized how invisible the community of blacks who were not Latino were. Joining the newly developing black movement in the country, she strove to educate and preserve the history of West Indians who had immigrated to Panama. Teaching at the University of Panama and simultaneously designing a course and teaching English at Florida State University-Panama, she carried on a dual career of activism and education until 2000, when she was made head of the English Department at the University of Panama. She has published two textbooks; a history of the African diaspora in Panama, which has been published multiple times in both English and Spanish; and wrote a widely-known play to address the historical contributions and biases which have impacted Panama's black citizens.
Early life.
Melva Lowe was born in 1945 in Red Tank, a town in the Panama Canal Zone to Matilde (née Wilson) and Oscar Lowe. She was the third child in a family of five children born to the couple who were first generation Afro-Panamanians. Her grandparents, immigrated from Jamaica as laborers to build the canal and lived in the zone designated for West Indian immigrants. Soon after her birth, her family moved to the town of La Boca, where she completed her primary studies. Around 1956, the family moved to Paraíso, where she finished her secondary schooling, at the Panama Canal Company schools, before moving to the United States to study at the Connecticut College for Women. After graduating with her bachelor's degree in 1968, she went on to complete a master's degree in English at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1970.
Career.
After completing her graduate studies, Professor Goodin took a post to teach at the University of Zambia in Lusaka. The university was in need of teachers and she believed that the experience would give her insight on the struggles of African people. After teaching in Zambia, she returned to Panama and was hired as a professor of English and literature at the University of Panama. In 1974, she was hired to design the English as a second language course for Florida State University-Panama and served as coordinator of the program for more than twenty years, while simultaneously teaching at the University of Panama.
Frustrated by the lack of inclusion in history texts of the African heritage in Panama, Lowe de Goodin became involved in the nascent black movement in Panama along with Gerardo Maloney. Alberto Smith, and Reina Torres de Araúz, among others. They organized an anthropological conference to discuss how they could preserve the contributions of the African diaspora in Panama. In 1980, the activists opened the Afro-Antillean Museum, but by the end of the year, realized that they did not have sufficient funds to keep the museum open. Hosting fairs and events to raise awareness of black history among the black population, the group developed a network. In 1981, Lowe de Goodin founded the Society of Friends of the West Indian Museum in Panama (), to raise funds and preserve cultural and literary heritage of Afro-Panamanians. In addition, the organization, formed on the model of the NAACP, brings about awareness of racism and actively supports an end to racial discrimination and measures to gain equality. She became the inaugural president and served through 1984. She was reelected president of SAMAAP in 1998 and served a two-year term.
In 1985, Lowe de Goodin wrote a play, "De Barbados a Panamá" (From Barbados to Panama) to tell the story of the Caribbean migrants who came to work on the Panama canal. The drama tells of the discrimination faced by Afro-Caribbean and Chinese laborers, who built the canal and railroad, and the legal impediments which required them to speak Spanish before they could attain citizenship. The work showed the importance of bi-lingual identity to immigrant communities and how the official stance to bar them from speaking English, branded them as outsiders, even among Afro-Latino neighbors. The drama allowed Lowe de Goodin to correct the historiography of the country, challenging both the omission of Afro-Caribbeans and the myths, like they all immigrated from Jamaica and were impervious to disease, in a literary format which was in common use at that time among women writers from Latin America. The play was first staged in 1985, and was performed again in 1997, when it was also televised. In 1999, the play was published as a book, in both English and Spanish.
In 1986, she founded the Panamanian branch of Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) and became its first president. In 1999, she left Florida State University and was appointed as the Director of the English Department at the University of Panama the following year, serving in that capacity through 2006. She has published two textbooks, "Practical Lessons in Business English" volumes 1 and 2, as well as a history of Afro-Panamanians, which has been published in both English and Spanish, as well as in a second Spanish edition, "Afrodescendientes en el Istmo de Panamá 1501–2012" (People of African ancestry in Panama, 1501–2012). The English edition of her book was released on the centennial of the construction of the Panama Canal. It evaluates the historical contributions of Panama's black citizens and how the cultural mix between Spanish, African and indigenous have led to a richer heritage, including the development of the country, as well as folklore and gastronomic traditions.

Myrlande Constant

Myrlande Constant (born 1968) is a Haitian textile artist who specializes in Vodou themed flags, or "drapo Vodou". Since she began making Vodou flags in the 1990s, she has transformed and surpassed this medium, preferring to make large-scale tableau, she describes her work as "painting with beads." Constant is married and the mother of four children.
Biography.
Constant was born in Port-au-Prince in Haiti where, as a teenager, she learned the art of beading while working with her mother in a Port-au-Prince factory making wedding dresses. Once she quit that job, she moved on to be one of the most celebrated artists for making Vodou drapo. Constant has taken part in the revolution in the art of drapo-making over the last two decades. She has been making flags since the 1900s. Since the 1900s, there was an abrupt shift in drapo-making, which was primarily a male art form. There are several new designers who are women now, one of them being Myrlande Constant. Because of the impact that Constant has on other people, she influences art-making in other individuals, in particular Marilyn Houlberg.
Constant bears witness to her nation's calamities. For example, after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, the artwork Myrlande made represented the collectivistic society through the things that were going on at the time.
Her works are densely beaded flags (some as large as six by seven feet). Constant's flags are much larger than traditional flags. In 2011, Constant participated in a series of exhibitions, workshops, and lectures at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, where she conducted a three-day flag-making workshop.
Principal expositions and works.
Myrlande Constant had her first sale to Richard A Morse, who was the manager of the Oloffson Hotel in Port-au-Prince. Other subsequent sales of her outstanding Vodou flags were made through the connections of her husband, Charles, who convinced customers and visitors at the hotel to buy her work. Many of Constant's inspirations for her artwork came from her father, who is a Vodou priest and Christian. She states that she has no one to thank but the spirits and God before the spirits. She additionally states that the mystical feelings and aspirations come from her thoughts. Everything she puts on a flag is there for a reason because the spirit keeps her working. Constant is also inspired by Milo Rigaud's landmark book called "Veve". This book contains symbolic drawings of spirits made on Vodou temple floors. Constant uses that inspiration to remember her memories of Vodou ceremonies and knowledge of the spirits to create her own design in the flags.
The main process of the making of her flags starts with pencil drawings on white cloth. Second, she sews the sequins and beads to the cloth. Lastly, she incorporates the colors that associate with the spirits. Typically, most of her works are as large as bedspreads depicting various significant events in Vodou and Haitian history through using needle, thread, cloth, and tiny adornments.
Constant is particularly a well-known Haitian and Vodou artist in many parts of the world. Specifically, her piece of the 2010 Haiti earthquake apocalypse was recognized as an immediate potential for becoming one of the 2011 Ghetto Biennale Exhibition in New York's most extreme and powerful artistic visions. In 2014, her work was exhibited along with André Eugène, Adler Guerrier, Pascale Monnin, and others in a group show co-curated by Herns Louis Marcelin and Kate Ramsey titled "Transformative Visions: Works by Haitian Artists from the Permanent Collection" that was held at the University of Miami Lowe Art Museum. In 2018, she was one of the participating artists in the group show, PÒTOPRENS: The Urban Artists of Port-au-Prince at Pioneer Works, co-curated by Haitian-American artist and curator Edouard Duval-Carrié and British artist and curator Leah Gordon. In 2019, along with twenty-two other artists, her work was exhibited in "The Last Supper" themed Faena Art Festival in Miami. Pushing the boundaries of the form, the largest of her flags measured 10 by 7 feet. In 2022, a retrospective of her work will be held at the Fowler Museum at UCLA.
Haiti madi 12 januye 2010 (Haiti Tuesday, January 12, 2010)
239 x 249 cm
Private collection
This piece of artwork is made with fabric, beads, and sequins. Myrlande Constant's tableau depicts the ruins and aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. It was commissioned by the Fowler Museum with funds provided by the Fay Bettye Green Fund to Commission New Work. This piece makes the viewer feel the need to study the miseries and disasters that happen in human life. The chaoticness of the imagery resembles how chaotic the actual event was in 2010. The visual characteristics include a border of crossbones and skulls, and angels and God looking down on the situation resembling the prophet Ezekiel's vision of dry bones: “The hand of the Lord was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and set me in the middle of the valley, it was full of bones. Ezekiel 37:1).” Other aspects of this piece include homes, churches, and Vodou temples, all being reduced to rubble. Dogs and pigs gnaw on the unburied unprotected human remains. The Catholic Archbishop Serge Miot, who is a man of God, lies dead under the fallen roof of his cathedral with a hand on a bible. Other individuals in the piece are shown as Vodouists who either carry a child in their arms or wheelbarrow the dead and wounded to the appropriate destinations as a summoning mortal to the hand of their maker in the call of Gabriel. More individuals either pick up the ruins or sink to the ground as if remaining upright on solid earth is not an option. Constant's piece depicted a meaning that explained the suffering as ultimately, just as with life, letting death go on. Looking forward to Ash Wednesday being faithful and having anticipation on Eastertide's Resurrection were things that Constant reminded the victims of. The victims were shown, “Remember that thou art dust, and to dust thou shalt return.” And so, too, the Gede will rise up to their feet, shake off the dirt, adjust their glasses, straighten their hats, grab their canes and crutches, and dance.

Crymogæa

Crymogæa (from Greek Κρυογαια, "ice-land") in is a book in Latin written by the Icelandic scholar Arngrímur Jónsson and published in Hamburg in 1609 and again in 1610. It was the first historical description of Iceland since Íslendingabók and the first comprehensive book about the history of Iceland.
Contents.
The book was aimed at foreign readers. The first part narrates the history of Iceland until the end of the Icelandic Commonwealth. The second part contains stories about the medieval Icelandic heroes. The third part continues the history of Iceland until Jónsson's time. Aside from the political and cultural history of Iceland, the book offers descriptions of the religion and language of the Icelanders.
Legacy.
Presenting the medieval period as a heroic golden age, followed by a decline into corruption under foreign rule, Jónsson created an influential narrative of Icelandic history which caused a revival of Icelandic scholars' interest in their past in the 17th century, and even influenced the Icelandic independence movement in the 19th century. It has been called "the manifesto of Icelandic patriotism."
"Crymogæa's" influence stretched much farther than Iceland. Because of it, Jónsson became the best-known Icelander among the learned Europeans in the 17th century. His humanistic work made them aware of the Icelandic sagas and kindled a general interest in medieval Icelandic literature. "Crymogæa" also introduced Norse mythology to the rest of Europe.

Kerry Freedman

Kerry Freedman is Professor of Art and Design Education at Northern Illinois University and Coordinator of Doctoral Programs in the College of Visual and Performing Arts. She is also a past Head of the Art + Design Education Division. Professor Freedman's research focuses on questions concerning the relationship of curriculum to art, culture, and technology.  Recently, she has particularly focused on inquiries into student learning through engagement with visual culture. She has provided significant leadership to the field through her various service roles and publications. Freedman's service roles include, but are not limited to: Senior Editor of "Studies in Art Education", the research journal of the National Art Education Association, and World Councilor of the International Society for Education through Art, a UNESCO affiliate. She was the co-Chair of the Art Education Research Institute.
Freedman is an active researcher with over 100 published articles and book chapters and her work has been translated into multiple languages. Freedman has done over 200 national and international presentations. She has been a Fulbright Scholar in countries of the former Soviet Union and Visiting Professor at several universities, including Harvard University, Cambridge University, University of Melbourne, University of Barcelona, and University of Sao Paulo.
The art education paradigm shift to VCAE (Visual Culture Art Education) has been greatly influenced by her work. Freedman's book, "Teaching Visual Culture", provided guidance in the transition from a narrow, discipline-based focus on fine art in education. Freedman argued that visual culture, including popular culture and fine art, is socially constructed and has become pervasive, shaping all aspects of public behavior and influencing conceptions of self. She sought a response to these conditions from educators to prepare students for the promises and pitfalls of visual culture. Recently, Kerry Freedman was an editor for the curriculum volume of The International Encyclopedia of Art &amp; Design Education, the first art and design education encyclopedia to be published.
Education.
Kerry Freedman obtained her Bachelor of Fine Arts and master's degrees in Art Education from the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana. Her Ph.D. in Curriculum and Instruction-Art Education with minors in Art (Computer Graphics), and Psychology was granted by the University of Wisconsin–Madison.
Career.
After teaching K-12 art, Freedman's higher education career began as a professor at the University of Minnesota from 1985–2000. Currently, she is a professor of Art and Design Education at Northern Illinois University. While at Northern Illinois University, Freedman was elected as a Distinguished Fellow of the National Art Education Association (NAEA) in 2000, received the 2006 NAEA Higher Art Educator of the year, and the 2014 Higher Art Educator of the Year by the Illinois Art Education Association (IAEA). She has also received the Leon Jackman Award (the Australian national award for distinguished research in art education), the Ziegfeld Award, the Manual Barkan Award (NAEA), the United States Society for Education through Art Award (2019) among others.
Freedman has worked in over twenty-five countries and has done over one hundred and fifty national and international presentations. She has also supported the arts through several PBS Kids publications that emphasized the importance of art in child development, self-expression, and developing connections.

Gerung of Meissen

Gerung (died 20 November 1170) was bishop of Meissen from 1152 to 1150, and previously abbot of Posa or Bosau Abbey.
His time as bishop is particularly remembered for the treaty which he agreed in 1154 with the immigrant Flemish settlers in Kühren. Also during Gerung's time in office Vladislaus II, Duke of Bohemia, because of border disputes with the Margravate of Meissen, overran the territory of the bishopric and caused much destruction, for which when he became king he compensated the bishop.
In 1160 Gerung took part with other bishops in an Imperial Diet in Erfurt, to discuss the suppression of the revolt in Milan against Emperor Frederick I. In 1163 he sat in judgment with the Emperor on the murderers of Archbishop Arnold of Selenhofen in Mainz, with serious consequences for the city, which suffered the loss of several important rights.
Gerung fell ill during a visit to Petersberg Abbey and died there. His body was transported for burial to Meissen Cathedral.

Gerard Fortune

Gerard Fortune, commonly known by his first name Gerard, is a Haitian artist. His exact date of birth is uncertain, though Gerard has said he was alive during the Haitian dictatorship of Jean Claude Duvalier, which would put his age at about 50–60 years old. Gerard was born and raised in the city of Petionville, a suburb of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince.
Style and early works.
As an adult, Gerard worked as a pastry chef before starting to paint in 1978. He continued making new pieces, always in naive style – a brightly colored, childlike, style of painting.
The subjects of Gerard’s paintings are vast, ranging from everyday matters, Biblical scenes, portraits of Haitian generals and politicians, animals and athletes. Gerard himself has said, “I’m obligated to paint vodou and Jesus and flowers and the sea. And villages and anything that comes to mind.” “God tells me what to paint, the feeling of each painting.” He says that God gives hope to him. “Inspiration comes from God at all hours.” 
Exhibits.
His work has been exhibited internationally in places like Nottingham Contemporary. Two of the places that include Gerard’s work in their permanent collections are Ramapo College, New Jersey and the Waterloo Center for the Arts in Waterloo, Iowa.

Alex O'Loughlin post-episode interviews.
In a post-episode interview with "TV Guide" lead actor Alex O'Loughlin stated that the McGarrett and Rollins relationship "had now been finished the right way" and that "McGarrett would be an idiot to take Catherine back". When asked if there was hope for a romantic reunion between the two characters O'Loughlin stated: "The way she [Catherine] left things, it was pretty disgraceful. That being said, it does offer some closure for him. It's now been finished the right way. I just think if she [Catherine] came back and went, 'I'm available'... first of all, he [McGarrett] really likes Lynn. She's [Lynn] a great girl. And I don't think he [McGarrett] would just ditch her [Lynn]. That would be the wrong thing to do."

Claude Dambreville

Claude Dambreville (born 1934) is a Haitian writer and painter. He was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, December 17, 1934. After attending art school in Haiti, he became a painter. Dambreville continued to write and in 1983, he won the annual literary Henri Deschamps award for his novel, "Un gout de Fiel."
Biography.
Claude Dambreville grew up in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. From a very young age he began writing and drawing. His first job was running a local radio station, and in his spare time he would submit humorous articles and hand-drawn comics to a weekly Haitian newspaper. In 1968, he enrolled at the Centre d'Arte in Port-au-Prince and began taking art classes. Around the same time, he took correspondence courses from the ABC school of Paris, and then enrolled at L'Atelier, a Haitian school owned by the artist Nehemy Jean. During his time in school he began successfully working full time as an artist. While studying at L'Atelier in 1973, he met and married the daughter of one of his teachers, Bettyna Savain. In 1981, he received a grant from the United States to tour art schools and museums giving lectures on his work and Haitian art.

Painting.
Claude Dambreville is best known for his paintings of Haitian women at market. His style combines bold, minimalistic 2D color blocking, with soft, brushy modeling along with a strong use of light and shadow. His more contemporary works have focused on portrait style painting of women, children and musicians. When asked how he chooses his subject matter he said, "I take my inspiration from the popular and rustic life of Haiti. In my opinion, it's the only way to identify myself as a Haitian Painter."

Mary Josephine Walters

Mary Josephine Walters (1837–1883), also known as Josephine Walters or M.J. Walters, was part of the 19th century American landscape painting movement known as the Hudson River School. She studied under Asher Durand and specialized in oil and watercolor painting. Though there is not much information about her life, her paintings exhibited much of the immense detail and precision that her mentor’s work did. Much of Walter's painting was done in the Adirondack and Catskill Mountains, though most of her currently known works are of the Hudson River.
Biography.
Mary Josephine Walters learned to paint under the guidance of Asher Durand. Asher Durand’s son, John Durand, wrote briefly about Walters in his father’s biography. He mentions “Miss Josephine Walters, whom he often advised in the pursuit of her studies,” and also remarks that she possibly accompanied Asher Durand on journeys to the Catskills and other regions looking for scenery to paint. The "Brooklyn Eagle" once reported on her as well, stating, “Miss Walters has attained great excellence in landscape painting. Having been a student with Durand, Miss W. seems to have learned the manipulations of that master, and sketches and paints with delicacy and a good deal of elaboration.”
Mary Josephine Walters managed a studio between 1867 and 1875. Her studio was located in the YMCA Building in New York, while she resided in Brooklyn. Walters moved to Hohokus, New Jersey with her mother by 1880 and, as she never married or had children, was free to explore the wilderness of northern New Jersey and the Catskills at her leisure.
Notable works.
Walters often had exhibitions at the National Academy of Design, the Brooklyn Art Association, and even as far as the San Francisco Art Association between the 1860s and 1880s. She painted mostly forest scenery, and much of her work is done in oil paint and exhibits meticulously painted foliage and great attention to detail. This is likely due to her close study under Asher Durand, whose work also exhibited great detail. Some of her notable works include:

Theard Aladin

Theard Aladin (October 12, 1925 – August 17, 1993) was a Haitian self-taught artist, noted for his artwork depicting Haitian life and use of bright colors in paintings.
Biography.
Aladin was from Jacmel, a city on the southern coast of Haiti. After working as a stonemason and farmer for many years, Aladin suffered a serious back injury in 1983, which left him unable to continue this line of work. For months he supported his family by doing odd jobs around Jacmel, but in fall of 1984, he had a dream in which he was told that he was an artist. The very next day, he began his first painting. Shortly thereafter, Aladin moved to a house in Carrefour, a commune outside of Port-au-Prince, where he worked closely with other Haitian artists until 1987. The subject matter of his paintings was typically scenes of working-class Haitians, but occasionally Aladin depicted religious accounts inspired by Haitian Vodou.
Aladin's artwork has been featured in books, including "The Vodou Box" by Manuela Dunn Mascetti. He was also mentioned in the book "Latin American and Caribbean Artists of the Modern Era: A Biographical Dictionary" which said he was "noted for his colorful naive compositions depicting Haitian life."
He died of heart disease on August 17, 1993, at the age of 68.
Theard had nine children, among which is artist Agathe Aladin. She spent much of her early life watching and helping her father paint.
His work is included in various galleries and exhibitions including "The Jonathan Demme Collection of Self-Taught Art" (2014) at Material Culture Gallery in Philadelphia.

Betty Haas Pfister

Elizabeth Haas Pfister (July 23, 1921 – November 17, 2011) was an American aviator.
Biography.
Haas Pfister was born Elizabeth Haas in Great Neck, New York, the second of three children of Merle (née Simon) and Robert Kalman Haas Sr. (son of California retailer Kalman Haas). She expressed an interest in aviation from an early age, and she began taking flying lessons while attending Bennington College in Vermont. By the time she graduated (early, with a degree in marine biology), she had enough flight hours to be a candidate to join the Women Airforce Service Pilots.
As a member of WASP, starting in 1943, she flew military aircraft within the United States, ferrying them from factory to airfield or airfield to port. Like other WASP members, she also assisted with aerial target practice, towing airborne targets, and flew test flights.
After World War II ended, Haas Pfister purchased (for $750) a decommissioned Bell P-39 Airacobra fighter plane. The plane, with serial number 44-2433, never saw combat during the war. Haas Pfister named it "Galloping Gertie", painted it red and white, and used it in races and exhibitions. The plane was loaned to the Smithsonian Institution in 1950, with the donation becoming permanent in 1956. In her racing career, Haas Pfister twice won the All Women’s International Air Race, in 1950 and 1952.
In her later career, Haas Pfister undertook a number of aviation endeavors. After the war, she worked for Pan American Airways as a stewardess and served as an aviation instructor. She started flying other aircraft like gliders and balloons, and in 1953, she earned her helicopter license, the 52nd American woman to do so. She competed with the U.S. Helicopter Team in the 1973 and 1978 world championships and later served as a judge.
Haas Pfister advocated for upgrades to the Aspen–Pitkin County Airport that allowed it to accommodate major commercial traffic. She supervised the construction of the Aspen Valley Hospital Heliport. She also helped found the Pitkin County Air Rescue Group, flying numerous rescue missions in the mountains. She founded the Aspen chapter of the Ninety-Nines International Organization of Women Pilots and the Snowmass, Colorado, Balloon Festival.
Awards and honors.
Haas Pfister was inducted into the Colorado Aviation Hall of Fame in 1984. The National Aeronautic Association gave her the Katharine Wright Memorial Award in 1992 and the Elder Statesman of Aviation Award in 1994. Whirly-Girls International, which she served as President from 1985–1987, gave her their Livingston Award in 1995.
In 2010, Haas Pfister was in attendance when the members of WASP, as a group, were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal.
Personal life.
Haas Pfister married Arthur Pfister in 1954; he died in 2008. They had three children: Suzanne Pfister, Christina Pfister Smith, and Nancy Pfister.

Andrea Bolley

Andrea Bolley (born 1949) is a Canadian abstract painter based in Toronto.
Work.
Bolley's paintings are abstract canvases which take their inspiration from Colour Field painters such as Helen Frankenthaler, Clyfford Still and Jules Olitski. Her work has been praised for the complex treatment of surface and depth. Bolley has made distinctive use of paper, both as a tool for the application of paint and in her "paper paintings", which incorporate a paper collage element. Bolley participated in the Art Gallery of Ontario's Artists with their Work program in the 1970s, for which she presented art workshops throughout the province of Ontario. In the 1970s and 1980s, Bolley worked closely with the painter Tony Calzetta and the two artists' work was paired in a number of exhibitions.
Exhibitions.
Bolley's first major exhibition was held at the Pollock Gallery in 1977, and received critical attention for the artist's seriousness and ability to establish her own expressive voice within the tradition of colour field painting. A retrospective exhibition of Bolley's work was held at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre in 1981. Solo exhibitions of her work have also been held at the Thames Art Gallery (2004), Gallery 132, Toronto (1994-2003), Gallery One (1984-1986), and the Pollock Gallery (1977-1980).
Collections.
Bolley's work is in major public and private collections including the Art Gallery of Windsor, Canada Council Art Bank, Imperial Oil, Labatt's of Canada, and Toronto Dominion Bank.

The Inheritance (play)

The Inheritance is a play by Matthew Lopez that is inspired by the novel "Howards End" by E. M. Forster. The play premiered in London at the Young Vic in March 2018, before transferring to Broadway in November 2019.
Productions.
Original London production.
The play was commissioned by Hartford Stage in Hartford, Connecticut. The play was produced in London at the Young Vic Theatre under the direction of Stephen Daldry in March 2018. The play was staged in two parts of over three hours each, intended to be viewed sequentially. It examines love between gay men in contemporary New York a generation after the AIDS epidemic. It asks what the current generation owes to its forebears.
The production transferred to the Noel Coward Theatre in London's West End on 21 September 2018 and was produced by Tom Kirdahy, Sonia Friedman, and Hunter Arnold.
"The Inheritance" won Best Play at the London Evening Standard Theatre Awards 2018.
"The Inheritance" also won Best New Play, Best Director for Stephen Daldry and Best Actor for Kyle Soller at both the 2019 Critics' Circle Awards and the 2019 Laurence Olivier Awards, also winning an Olivier for Best Lighting for Jon Clark.
Original Broadway production.
The play premiered on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on 27 September 2019 in previews, with the official opening on 17 November. The production features Lois Smith as Margaret, with Kyle Soller and John Benjamin Hickey, among others, reprising their roles from the London production.
In December 2019, it was announced that Tony Goldwyn would replace Hickey for a four-month stint beginning in January 2020, while Hickey was set to direct a revival of "Plaza Suite". However, in February 2020, it was announced that "The Inheritance" would close on March 15, after 46 previews and 138 regular performances. On March 12, the final four performances were cancelled when all Broadway theaters closed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
Critical response.
The reviewer for "The Telegraph" called the play “perhaps the most important American play of this century.” 
The "Variety" reviewer wrote the play is a "...vast, imperfect and unwieldy masterpiece that unpicks queer politics and neoliberal economics anew. In addressing the debt gay men owe to their forebears, it dares to ask whether the past hasn’t also sold the present up short."
"The Guardian" reviewer wrote: "While Lopez’s play has a literary framework, it teems with life and incident...Lopez is also unafraid to periodically stop the plot and clear the stage for an impassioned debate: one of the most intense is about the status of gay culture which, having fought so long against oppression, now finds itself in danger of being co-opted."
The show received mixed to negative reviews on Broadway. As Ben Brantley wrote in "The New York Times": "Its breadth doesn't always translate into depth."
Michael Billington praised Paul Hilton's performance the Young Vic Theatre production in a list by "The Guardian" writers of the 50 greatest theatre shows since 2000, in which "The Inheritance" placed 15th.

The ship was completed in 1931 and was the only pleasure boat build by the Electric Boat Company during that period due to the beginning of the Great Depression. The ship was christened in 1931 and made its maiden voyage from New London, Connecticut to Oyster Bay. 
The Puritan was put up for sale in 1932 after the death of Edward Brown. It was purchased in 1933 by Harry Bauer, the president of Southern California Edison, for $35,000. He sailed the ship from the eastern United States to California by way of the Panama Canal. Sterling Hayden, only seventeen at the time, was a passenger on the journey and would later write about it in his 1963 biography, "Wanderer". Bauer sold the Puritan for $1 to the United States Navy on December 7th, 1941, the day of the Attack on Pearl Harbor. 
Beginning active duty with the U.S. Navy, commissioned as , "Puritan" was assigned to the Western Sea Frontier, 11th Naval District, San Diego. Fear of Japanese attack had reached a zenith on the west coast by 1942. "Puritan" operated on the San Diego Coastal Patrol throughout her Naval career, guarding against such an attack. "Puritan" had but a brief tour with the U.S. Navy and was placed out of service at San Diego, California, on 27 September 1943. She was struck from the Navy Register on 28 June 1944 and transferred to the War Shipping Administration for return to her former owner on 18 November 1944.
Bauer owned the "Puritan" up until his death in 1961. In 1957, he allowed the American Museum of Natural History in New York to use the "Puritan" as a base of operations for an expedition. The expedition focused on the gulf of California and logged more than 4,000 miles while collecting specimens and studying the region. Members of the expedition included Oakes Plimpton, Richard Van Gelder, and Richard G. Zweifel and led to the discovery of Van Gelder's bat, among other finds. In 1963, the boat was purchased at auction for $90,300 by Doyle D.W. Downey after sitting in mooring for two years after Bauer's death. 
Downey had previously purchased the "Satartia" (later known as "Southwind") from Bauer, another schooner designed by John Alden. Downey used the Puritan in the charter trade in the Virgin Islands. In 1967, he ended up selling the Puritan to Mariano Prado-Sosa for $120,000. Mariano was a member of a wealthy Peruvian family that included Mariano Ignacio Prado, former president of Peru. Mariano refurbished the schooner and begins using it as a charter between Miami, Florida and the Virgin Islands. The boat was seized by the Mexican government on a charter to Acapulco. It was seized on behalf of the Peruvian government who blamed the Prado family for inequalities in Peru. 
In 1971, the "Puritan" was towed from Acapulco to Costa Rica and then brought back to Miami. At the time, the schooner was in poor shape in that nothing on the boat was operative except for the main engine. The toilets were plugged, batteries dead, and it could not travel more than four knots due to the condition of the hull. It was purchased by Bill and Patsy Bolling in 1972, who spent seven months restoring the schooner. They returned the "Puritan" to charter in the Caribbean and also took part in schooner races, winning the Mystic Seaport Invitational Schooner Race in 1973.
The "Puritan" was sold to Oscar Schmidt in 1978. Schmidt sailed the Puritan to Newport, Rhode Island in 1980 for the America's Cup races. While there, he entered it into the Classic Yacht Regatta where it won first in class. The schooner spends the next decade sailing the world, visiting places such as Bermuda and France. In 1989, it was sold again, this time to Arturo Ferruzzi who keeps it in Antibes until it is sold to the current owner in 2015. It underwent a full refit and was put into service as a charter vessel with The Classic Yacht Experience.

Alice Garver

Alice Garver (1924-1966) was an American painter and printmaker, particularly known for large-format abstract expressionist drawings and monotype prints. She is recognized as an important Albuquerque, New Mexico artist.
Personal life and education.
Garver was born in Toledo, Ohio and studied at the University of Toledo, Toledo Art Museum, and Skidmore College. She married husband Jack Garver in 1946, after which the couple moved to Albuquerque in order for Garver to study at the University of New Mexico under emeritus professor Raymond Jonson. Alice and Jack Garver had three children.
Artistic works.
Alice Garver was known for her large-scale drawings and prints, with most produced in the 1950s using a unique printing technique. Her primary technique is described in the book "Visualizing Albuquerque:"Garver rolled a solid color onto the matrix and laid the paper on top of the ink. By drawing and pressing on the back of the paper she transferred loose, sketchy marks to the paper. By repeating this process over and over with multiple colors, Garver created highly energetic works at a huge scale for the period.Garver also produced murals, most notably fifteen eight-by-twelve foot murals in Albuquerque's First National Bank Building East, which depicted various periods of New Mexico history; subjects include the Duke of Alburquerque (17th floor), the atomic age (16th floor), pioneer wagons, and indigenous peoples. The murals were created by sketching images, applying color to rice paper, and subsequent rubbing, with colors adhered to walls with the use of wheat paste. Relatively few works by Garver survive, including the murals, due to their delicate nature.
Both Alice and Jack Garver's work appears to be influenced by the style of Jackson Pollock, particularly the "all-over" linear effect. Their paintings have been described as having "an autonomous quality, as if the paining had somehow, at least in part, materialized by itself, freed from the artist's hand." Alice achieves this effect through transferring color from another surface through rubbing, as described above; the result resembles a "natural discoloration."
Garver was one of 20 Albuquerque artists whose work was displayed in a February 1960 show organized by de Kooning at The Great Jones Gallery in New York City. One of Garver's monoprints--"Sleeping Woman,"which incorporates "classical figuration within expressionism"—was featured in the 2013 South Broadway Cultural Center's exhibition "Albuquerque Art: A Look Back." Another of Garver's monoprints (Untitled landscape, ca. 1950s, monoprint on paper mounted on panel, 40x 95 in.) was also featured in a 2015 exhibition, Visualizing Albuquerque, on display in a number of museums and galleries across Albuquerque.

Marjorie Ann Nuhn

Marjorie Ann Nuhn (October 31, 1898–January 1988) was an American painter who focused on watercolor. She was part of the Stone City Art Colony and studied under many teachers, most notably Adrian Dornbush. After the colony, she continued to travel around North America looking for inspiration for her work. She came back to Cedar Falls when she retired, then died in January 1988.
Life.
Nuhn was born in Cedar Falls, Iowa and raised by her parents, William and Anna Nuhn. She also had two younger siblings. Her brother Ferner was born in 1903 and her sister Hilda was born in 1906. She grew up in Cedar Falls, attending elementary school through high school there her entire life. She even stayed in town for college, graduating in 1926 from the University of Northern Iowa with a certificate to teach kindergarten.
After receiving encouragement from her instructors, Nuhn decided to forgo teaching to pursue her career as an artist. In 1929, she enrolled in the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. It was here that she learned about the various media that she used for the rest of her career. She continued her studies at the Chicago Art Institute. There she learned a lot about watercolor painting but she really grew in this medium when she went to the Stone City Art Colony.
Nuhn attended the colony from 1932 to 1933. While she was there, artists like Grant Wood and John Steuart Curry were instructors. Adrian Dornbush, her faculty mentor at the colony, was the one most involved with her learning. Out of all the instructors there, he was able to really identify Nuhn's strengths and help develop them while she was there. Once she left the colony, she returned home to continue developing her artwork on her own.
Her style was very abstract with its use of watercolor to morph and blend color to create an image. While it was representational, houses and trees are clearly what they are, it wasn't realistic by any means. She found success at home with small exhibitions, but she felt like she needed a change. Most of her work at the time focused on her home state of Iowa. While this wasn't shameful to her, she wanted to broaden her scope and paint other scenes from around the country.
Her interest in Native American culture and themes brought her to many places in the US. These locations include Vermont, California, New Mexico, and Arizona. While she lived in New Mexico, she attended some classes at the Arsuna School of Fine Arts. She also made many trips in the 1960s to Yellowstone National Park. The colored hot pools at the park were what fascinated her the most. She dedicated many abstract pieces of hers to these natural springs.
Her trips eventually took her out of the country. She spent about ten months in Mexico, from 1939 to 1940, visiting Taxco, Mexico City and elsewhere. The following year, she went to Guatemala, spending three months visiting locations such as Guatemala City and Antigua. She would return to Mexico in 1949, to look for further inspiration. The subjects she really liked painting from both locations were the people. All of her trips were done in a car on her own. She would pack enough clothes and art supplies to last the whole trip. It is also noted that she had learned to be very resourceful on her long trips.
She found a lot of success in Cedar Falls. Whenever she came back home from her trips, she would have new pieces to show at local exhibitions. Many local galleries in town like the Cedar Falls Art Association, benefited from the crowds she drew to every new opening. Nuhn also had many successful solo exhibitions in other parts of the US. These locations include Chicago, Santa Fe, New York, Des Moines and Dubuque.
In 1975, the University of Northern Iowa gave a retrospective exhibition of her and her artwork, located at the Maucker Union. After a few more exhibitions, she retired to her home town and lived at a local health care center until her death.

Paul Revere Pottery

The Paul Revere Pottery was a woman-run American art pottery founded during the Progressive Era in Boston, Massachusetts in the United States. It emerged as a subgroup of the Saturday Evening Girls Club (S.E.G.). The library group was started and guided by Edith Guerrier, a librarian; her partner, Edith Brown, an artist; and Helen Osborne Storrow, the financial patron of the group. The Saturday Evening Girls Club was established in 1899, and located in Boston's North End. The group aimed to serve as an intellectual and social hub for young immigrant girls that otherwise had very few economic, educational, or social opportunities due to cultural differences. Paul Revere Pottery was established in the early twentieth century. The pottery gained national and international recognition.
The Saturday Evening Girls.
Facilitated by Guerrier, the Saturday Evening Girls Club was a Progressive era reading group consisting of young Jewish and Italian working women. The group met at the North Bennet Street Industrial School (NBSIS), a community charity building that provided educational opportunities and training in vocational skills for both boys and girls. Much like other groups and charity organizations of the era, the clubs and facilities at NBSIS aimed to Americanize the young persons, bridging the cultural gap between immigrant families and Protestant American culture. The multiple reading groups that Guerrier led were organized and named after the day of the week the women met; the Saturday Evening Girls consisting mostly of older girls with responsibilities to their families or who additionally held down jobs. The women of S.E.G. had either immigrated themselves or were born to immigrant parents. Through activities and group discussions, the S.E.G. provided social and intellectual stimulation for the young women, exposing them to an array of experience across religious, language, and ethnic divides. Weekly meetings covered subjects ranging from music, literature, economics, job opportunities, and art. Often, prominent members of the Boston community would attend the S.E.G. meetings and give lectures or lead group discussions on a variety of historical and contemporary issues. Involvement in clubs like the S.E.G. provided the space to advance women's education in a manner that worked outside of traditional education methods, exposing the young woman to opportunities for socializing without fear of provocation for being female, for being of a specific religious group, or ethnicity. The women participating in S.E.G. stand out from turn of the century women at large, as S.E.G.’s members pursued higher education at a significantly higher rate than the native-born women surrounding them.
The Pottery.
While on vacation in Europe in 1906, Guerrier and Brown were inspired by the folk work of peasant artisans. The connection, economically and culturally, between the artisans and the women of S.E.G. seemed strong to Guerrier and Brown:
Guerrier and Brown suspected that once trained, the pottery works sold by the S.E.G.s would provide an opportunity to gain additional income for many of the girls whose endeavors for higher education stood in direct contrast to the economic disparity and needs of their families.
Brown's art training contributed to solidifying the dream for a pottery. Starting in 1908, Brown taught pottery classes at NBSIS. Admittance of girls to the pottery classes was not supported by the institution, much to the frustration of Brown and Guerrier. NBSIS did not officially find the pursuit a worthwhile endeavor for young ladies. According to the institution, pottery classes did not increase the young women's potential for success as future mothers and assistants to their families. The commodification of their work turned the work from leisure-activity into a capitalist venture, which the institution deemed an unsuitable pursuit.
Storrow, a philanthropist and friend of Guerrier and Brown, decided to fund the pottery. In 1908, Storrow bought a four-story brick building in the North End, located on Hull Street. The Library Club House, or Hull House as it was often called, was very near to the Old North Church. The iconic church, where Paul Revere had hung his lantern, inspired the pottery's name: Paul Revere Pottery.
The S.E.G. had to seek much of their own funding to support the pottery and maintain themselves through the accomplishments they had cultivated as a group. S.E.G. secured funds through musical performance, reciting dialogues and plays, and poetry readings to wealthy members of the community and at different institutional galas and socials.
The prices of the wares produced by the pottery were only affordable to middle or upper class families; Storrow subsidized the wares. By 1914, Storrow's philanthropy had new aims with different organizations and concerns. She gave the S.E.G.s a year to become self-sustaining, provided them with a new building for their expanding pottery business, and then withdrew her financial support in 1915. Paul Revere Pottery continued to flourish for several decades, garnering national and international recognition through features in magazines, journals, and newsletters. At the height of its popularity in the 1910s, the pottery's wares were sold in most major cities throughout the United States.
18 Hull Street, the original site of the pottery, is a stop on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.
Design.
The earthenware works came in numerous forms, operated at multiple levels of function and utility, and had complex, decorative glaze surfaces. Guerrier and Brown hired a local potter and pottery chemist who had worked in the Merrimac Pottery of Newburyport, Massachusetts, to help set the pottery in motion. The chemist provided the S.E.G. with a handful of recipes to begin working with.&lt;/ref&gt; The studio primarily utilized yellow, blue, green, gray, white, and brown glazes at its onset. The range of glaze formulas and colorant usage expanded over time as technical skill was built and funding was more readily established. Soon, the pottery had a rich array of colors on their ware that played off and activated more fully the fanciful design elements.
Brown is credited for the principle designs for the pottery's works. Popular surface treatment of ceramic ware began to permeate the technical process and design. These designs harkened back to folk art while simultaneously expressing influence from Art Nouveau. The motifs ranged from simplified, country landscapes and houses of import to scenes from American history, such as Paul Revere making his famous ride. Floral designs including stylized lotus, tulips, and roses adorned many surfaces in equal measure with barnyard or symbolic wild animals, which pranced alongside winding script or grassy horizon lines. Bowls and plates with phrases or mottos involving allusions to virtues, or pieces bearing individualized names, were the most popular from the pottery, especially within the run of ware that was designed as a children's line.
Many of the forms that came out of the pottery were wheel thrown, but the forms which were more popular and produced in greater abundance were expressed from molds. Every pottery piece is signed with “S.E.G.” on the bottom, signifying the reading group, followed by the initials of the young woman artist who made or finished the form. On occasion, multiple initials were present on the forms.
In addition to making pottery vessels and objects, Paul Revere Pottery also made several ceramic tile friezes, usually depicting people interacting in wholesome environments with idyllic, romantic interactions occurring amongst characters and animals.
Edith Brown.
The pottery's artistic director, Edith Brown (September 10, 1872 - August 27, 1932), was born in Novia Scotia. In the early 1890s she moved to Boston, where she taught art classes at the North Bennet Street School. She met Edith Guerrier while taking an evening class at the Museum School (now the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts). and in 1908 became director of the pottery studio. Brown and Guerrier lived together in an apartment above the pottery in Brighton until Brown's death in 1932. Brown is remembered on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail. In 2014, her work was included with that of Alice Austin, Sara Galner, Edith Guerrier, Ethel Reed, and Mary H. Northend in an exhibit at the Boston University Art Gallery titled "Craft &amp; Modernity: Professional Women Artists in Boston (1890-1920)."
Sara Galner.
One of the pottery's most celebrated artists was Sara Galner (1894-1982), a Jewish Austro-Hungarian immigrant who worked there for over ten years. Galner migrated to the United States with her family in 1901 and grew up on Salem Street in the North End. At the age of 14 she left school to go to work, but continued her education at the Central Evening High School and was active in the Saturday Evening Girls. In 1911 she went to work full-time at the pottery, where her starting salary was $7 a week. She quickly distinguished herself as a decorator with a special talent for floral designs. She also worked as a salesperson and eventually became the manager of the pottery's Washington, D.C. store. Galner stayed on at the pottery until 1921, when she married Morris Bloom. Over 130 ceramic works decorated by Galner are included in the permanent collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

Satellite internet constellation

A satellite internet constellation is a constellation of artificial satellites providing satellite internet service. In particular, the term has come to refer to a new generation of very large constellations (sometimes referred to as a megaconstellations) orbiting in low Earth orbit (LEO) to provide low-latency, high bandwidth (broadband) internet service.
History.
While more-limited satellite internet services have been available through geosynchronous commsats orbiting in geostationary orbit for years, these have been of quite limited bandwidth (not broadband), high-latency, and provided at such a relatively high price that demand for the services offered has been quite low.
In the 1990s, several LEO satellite internet constellations were proposed and developed, including Celestri (63 satellites) and Teledesic (initially 840, later 288 satellites). These projects were abandoned after the bankruptcy of the Iridium and Globalstar satellite phone constellations in the early 00's.
In the 2010s, interest in satellite internet constellations reemerged due to the dropping cost of launching to space and the increased demand for broadband internet access. Internet satellite constellations are planned by private companies like OneWeb (OneWeb constellation), SpaceX (Starlink), Amazon (Project Kuiper), Samsung, Boeing and Russia's Roscosmos (Sfera) and China (Hongwan, 2018, or national satellite internet project, 2021).. By late 2018, more than 18,000 new satellites had been proposed to be launched and placed in LEO orbits between 2019 and 2025. This is more than ten times as many satellites as the sum of all active satellites in space as of March 2018. More recent proposals by 2020 could bring that number to over 100,000.
A year after the start of fielding the first satellite internet constellation—Starlink which began launching in late 2019 and began beta test of the network in late 2020; OneWeb began satellite deployment in 1H2020—the competitive disruption to established satellite company business models began to be better understood. In early 2021, the three largest European satellite operators SES, Eutelsat, and Hispasat—which had until that time eschewed developing and fielding a broadband satellite internet constellation with private funds—informed the European Commission that they would be willing invest in the development of such a project if the European Union were to invest government funds in the effort as well. All three companies had formerly focused on the provision of communication services from GEO and MEO orbits, while the newer satellite internet providers have been fielding their constellations exclusively in LEO.
Design.
Proposed systems vary greatly in the number of satellites, the types of orbits and the telecommunication architecture (in particular the presence or absence of inter-satellite links). System designs have been analyzed using statistical methods and simulations to estimate the total throughput. Particularly challenging is the dynamic nature of the network, as LEO satellites typically pass over a given location in less than 10 minutes.
Potential.
For continental distances (greater than about 3,000 km), LEO satellite internet networks are expected to be able to provide lower latency than optical fiber links. This is expected to hold even without inter-satellite links, using only ground station relays. The new networks are said to be able to "potentially compete with today's ISPs in many settings".
Criticism.
Critics have objected against the increased light pollution for astronomy and the increased possibility satellite collisions resulting in space debris. Astronomers have studied the potential effects increased satellite usage in Low Earth Orbit would have on very large telescope that use ultra-wide imaging exposures, such as the 8.4-meter Simonyi Survey Telescope used in the Legacy Survey of Space and Time project at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. They found that 30 to 40% of exposures could be compromised during the first and last hours of the night.
Astronomers have also voiced concern over the impact satellite internet constellations will have on radio astronomy.

Ollie Josephine Prescott Baird Bennett

Ollie Josephine Prescott Baird Bennett (March 27, 1874 – February 4, 1957) was an American doctor, She was one of the first five women doctors to serve in the U.S. Army Medical Corps and as a first lieutenant in World War I. She instructed more than three hundred nurses and enlisted men in the administration of anesthesia at Camp McClellan, Alabama and served from May 1, 1918, to October 5, 1918.
Early life.
Ollie Josephine Prescott Baird Bennett was born in Decatur, Macon County, Illinois to John and America Stackhouse. She graduated from University of Pittsburgh and Boston Medical School.
World War I.
Ollie Josephine Prescott Baird was the first female medical officer commissioned in the U.S. Army. Upon joining the army she was sent to an anesthesia course at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, New York. She was one of three contract physician anesthetists who served stateside. Mary Botsford and Dolores Pinero were the other women.
Baird was assigned to Fort McClellan, near Anniston, Alabama, where she instructed nurses and enlisted men in how to dispense anesthesia. She was also in charge of anesthesia for two operating rooms and gave anesthesia to five to seven patients every day. She designed her own uniform because the U.S. Army did not have uniforms for female physicians. Baird later stated that she was instructed not to wear insignia, but the commanding officer of the hospital gave her permission to wear a cord on her hat denoting lieutenant.
Following her military service, she was appointed to the War Industries Board.
Personal life.
Ollie Josephine Stackhouse married George L. Prescott on July 15, 1889 in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois. She had one daughter by this marriage, Olive, Mrs. E.W. Digges. On July 3, 1909 she married William F. Baird in Boston, Massachusetts and had two children. She was twice widowed. On February 4, 1934 she married Christopher C. Bennett.
Dr. Bennett was active in her community. In 1928, she joined the Mary Washington Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR). She was a charter member of the Women's City Club, and was a member of the Washington Branch of the Association of the American University Women's Club, the Maryland Historical Society, the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, the National Genealogy Society, the Order of the Eastern Star, and the National Presbyterian Church. Genealogy and historical research were her hobbies.
Ollie Josephine Prescott Baird Bennett died on February 4, 1957 in Alexandria, Virginia and was interred at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.

William Tichenor House

The William Tichenor House, near Upton, Kentucky, is a historic house built around 1820. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.
It was built as a two-story dogtrot-style double pen house. The breezeway was later enclosed (c.1910). A separate log kitchen was linked by a frame addition c.1900.
It became the home of the William Tichenor family; William Tichenor was a shareholder in the 1896 formation of the Sonora Bank and he had a large farm south of
Sonora.
It was deemed notable "as a relatively unaltered example of a two-story dogtrot style home. It is one of the five most significant dogtrot log homes located in the county and retains its original plan."

Helen Waimel Robertson nee Staebler (1917-2002) was a Canadian sculptor.
Biography.
Born in Tartu, Estonia, Robertson emigrated with her family to Canada in 1926. In 1934, she received a scholarship to attend Ontario College of Art. One of her teachers was Emanuel Hahn, the first president of the Sculptors Society of Canada. She graduated from the four-year program in three years, and was the recipient of a Governor General's Academic Medal. Robinson became a member of the Sculptors' Society of Canada in 1954. Robertson eventually settled in Chippawa, Ontario, with her husband A. Blake Robertson and lived there for the rest of her life.
Work.
Robertson worked in several media, including metals, stone, and wood. She was commissioned by the Canadian government to sculpt coats of arms and other works. She designed the Canadian Coat of Arms in the St. Catharine's Federal Building, the coat of arms in the Customs Building in Niagara Falls, and Stations for the Cross for St. Kevin's Roman Catholic Church, Welland. Other commissions include works for the Colonnade in Toronto, the Cobourg Municipal Building, the Niagara Falls City Hall, St. Denis School in St. Catharines, and the Workman's Compensation Rehabilitation Centre.
In 1940, Robertson sculpted water nymphs for the Bullas Bros. Furniture store on Charles Street, Kitchener and they adorned that building until it was torn down in 1985. The city put the Bullas sculptures in storage as it searched for a permanent site for them until placing the cast stone works in the Centre In The Square.
In November 2002, the Niagara Parks Commission and Robertson's family unveiled three sculptures outside of the Niagara Parks Greenhouse. The three bronze sculptures are collectively known as 'Golden Fountain'.

Ben Crack-O

Ben Crack-O (d. December 14, 1842) was a king of the Crack-O tribe in the region around Cape Palmas, in the present day border area of Liberia and the Ivory Coast, in the 1840s. He was killed by men under Commodore Matthew C. Perry during the Ivory Coast Expedition.
Crack-O tribe.
King Crack-O ruled over the Crack-O tribe, who were an inland people that desiring to engage in foreign trade fought against the Bassa Cove and Berribee people and established ten miles of coast on which they built five towns.
Battle of Little Bereby.
Commodore Perry, Liberian Governor Joseph Jenkins Roberts, and King Crack-O agreed to hold a palaver at King Crack-O's capital of Little Berribee to discuss alleged piracy by King Crack-O against American shipping. During the meeting held on December 13, King Crack-O through an interpreter denied any involvement in piracy against the American schooner Mary Carver, which had been plundered earlier in the year in the vicinity. The American officers and Governor Roberts felt the interpreter was an "unskillful liar". Commodore Perry stood up and denounced the interpreter as a liar before moving to confront King Crack-O. A scuffle ensued and the US sergeant of the marines shot and wounded King Crack-O while two other marines bayoneted him. The gathering broke down into a melee with King Crack-O's men running in all directions. His interpreter was shot dead while trying to run away. Commodore Perry ordered the town to be burned. The American sailors "gave three cheers and then applied the torch" and in 15 minutes the whole town was set on fire.
King Crack-O was taken prisoner by the Americans and died from his wounds the next morning.

Mireille Delisme

Mireille Delisme, (also known by her commercial artist name, Mireille Delice), is a Haitian drapo Vodou artist from Léogâne, Haiti.
Biography.
Delisme's career began in 1986, when taught sewing and beading techniques by her cousin, named either Myrlande Constant or Yolande Ceauston. Soon after, she began working alongside her cousin in Port-au-Prince at a factory embellishing wedding dresses for export. Following the closing of the factory in 1990 due to political and economic issues, Delisme recalls having a dream in which she was visited by the spirits. When relating the dream to her father, an oungan (vodou priest), he interpreted the message to be from the vodou spirit or lwa named Erzulie. Erzulie, the spirit of love, is represented in vodou tradition by a heart, which was the same design symbolized in Delisme's dream. Using beads left over from her time at the factory, the heart symbol visualized in her dream became the sequin design for her first drapo (flag).
Delisme recollects having more than one dream in which spirits visited her. During the third dream, she was delivered the message that, “I did not have to work in the factory, but I could learn to work for myself and earn for my family.” In 1990, having lost her job at the factory in conjunction with the lwa messages, Delisme decided to begin her life as an independent artist at age 25. Delisme continued to master her needlework skills by creating more drapo, finding design inspiration from her dreams and vodou symbols given to her by her father. Much of Delisme's beadwork incorporates designs that represent traditional Vodou deities and are used to explain divinity and give clarity to life's expressions and meanings. Her flags represent her spirituality and are used for guidance, wisdom, and healing. Her bright color combinations within the sequins and beads add to the mood and spirit of each piece. Since becoming an independent artist, Delisme has built an atelier in Haiti. The workshop was constructed to more efficiently assemble the bead-work for her drapo designs. Delisme describes the envisioned designs to a paid artist to be drawn or traced for the drapo and once done, is passed on to be beaded by Delisme herself or one of her seven employed artists at the workshop.
In January 2010, Delisme's hometown was at the epicenter of a massive earthquake. Delisme and her family were among those affected by the earthquakes destruction. Although her home and workshop in the capital were safe, 18 miles away, Delisme stated, “I felt I had to express the disaster in Haiti in my artwork."
During the country's recovery, the Smithsonian—in collaboration with the people of Haiti, several national and international agencies, and the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities—coordinated the 2010 Folklife Festival. The festival was an effort to salvage, restore, and safeguard art treasures damaged or endangered by the earthquake. Several artists, including Delisme, participated in the event by demonstrating and selling their artwork in the Festival Marketplace.
In 2011, Delisme's work Catastrophe du 12 Janvier, a vodou flag created to depict the crumpled buildings and the bodies of the dead caused by the earthquake, was part of an annual exhibit at the Museum of International Folk Art titled “The Arts of Survival: Folk Expression in the Face of Natural Disaster.” The exhibit explored how folk artists helped their communities recover from four natural disasters that occurred around 2011: The Haitian Earthquake, Hurricane Katrina, Pakistani floods, and the Mt. Merapi volcanic explosion in Indonesia. Also part of International Folk Arts Week, Delisme sold more of her pieces at her booth during the Santa Fe International Folk Arts Market. She said she shipped about 160 flags and carried more in her suitcase in preparation for the event.

Work.
Geller's video work often featured herself as a performer. Works such as "48-Hour Beauty Blitz" (1982) examine cultural standards of feminine beauty from a feminist perspective. Her work has also been noted for its humorous perspective on gender and sexuality. Toward the end of her life, Geller produced small, hand-worked sculptures from found objects which she called "Shwabties", inspired by ancient Egyptian funerary figures, and created works on paper that took the form of illuminated pages from books, particularly medical texts. Critics have noted a shamanistic aspect of these later works.
Geller's video work is distributed by Video Pool in Winnipeg and Vtape in Toronto. Her work is in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada.

Christian Dustmann

Christian Dustmann, FBA, is a German economist who currently serves as Professor of Economics at the Department of Economics of University College London. There, he also works as Director of the Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration (CReAM), which he helped found. Dustmann belongs to the world's foremost labour economists and migration scholars.
Biography.
Dustmann earned a B.Sc. in business economics from the University of Bielefeld in 1983, followed by a M.A. in economics from the University of Georgia (Athens, Georgia) in 1985 and a M.Sc. in business economics from the University of Bielefeld in 1985. Thereafter, Dustmann went on to obtain a Ph.D. in economics from the European University Institute in Florence in 1992 and finally a habilitation in economics and econometrics from the University of Bielefeld in 1997. After his Ph.D., Dustmann briefly worked at the University of Bielefeld as assistant professor of economics from 1992 to 1994 and then moved to the University College London, where he has been working ever since, being promoted from lecturer to reader in 2002 and finally to full professor in 2004. In 2004, Dustmann also founded the Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration, whose director he remains. In parallel, he has held many visiting appointments, including at Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and Yale.
In terms of professional affiliations and memberships, Dustmann is a research associate of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Centre for Economic Policy, research fellow of the Centre for Economic Policy Research, member of the Council of the Royal Economic Society, elected fellow of the Academia Europaea, National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, Society of Labor Economists and British Academy. Moreover, in the past, he has served as president of the European Society for Population Economics and of the European Society for Labour Economists. Besides working as referee for numerous academic journals in economics, Dustmann performs editorial duties for the "Journal of Labor Economics" and has done so before for the "Journal of Population Economics" and the "Economic Journal". In addition to his positions in academia, Dustmann has advised the British Home Office, the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, and the Economic and Social Research Council.
Research.
Christian Dustmann's research interests include various topics within labour economics, including migration, inequality and education. Many of Dustmann's contributions to research in these areas are summarized in his edited volume on the economics of education and training (with Bernd Fitzenberger and Stephen Machin), his chapter on migration and education with Albrecht Glitz in the "Handbook of the Economics of Education" and in his edited volume on migration. According to IDEAS/RePEc, he ranks among the top 1% most cited economists worldwide.
Research on the economics of migration.
The economics of temporary and return migration.
One of the most important topics within Dustmann's research on migration concerns return migration (a.k.a. temporary migration). Using SOEP data, Dustmann finds that immigrants' duration of stay in Germany, i.e. whether or not they immigrate permanently, affects the convergence of natives' and immigrants' earnings as permanent immigrants' tend to invest more into country-specific human capital and, under certain circumstances, immigrants with higher ability are more likely to immigrate permanently. As a consequence, Dustmann argues that governments need to clarify as early as possible whether permanent immigration is possible and under which conditions. In further work (partly with Oliver Kirchkamp), Dustmann finds that return migration is affected by the relative volatility of labour markets in host and home countries and migrants' precautionary savings, by their education and the family bounds they have established prior to emigration (for Turkish Guest Workers), by the number and sex of children they have had in the host country, and by the wage differentials between Germany and their home countries. Moreover, he and Kirchkamp observe that the majority of returnees from Germany to Turkey among Turkish Guest Workers remained economically active, typically as entrepreneurs. With regard to the UK, Dustmann and Yoram Weiss explore how price differentials between the UK and migrants' home countries, migrants' preference to live in their home countries, and better opportunities to accumulate valuable human capital in the UK determine return migration. Moreover, in research with Josep Mestres, Dustmann finds that changes in return plans are related to large changes in immigrants' remittances to their home countries. Finally, along with Itzhak Fadlon, Weiss and Dustmann use a Roy model to explore the effect of return migration and skill-specific human capital accumulation on the brain drain in migrants' home countries, which may instead experience a "brain gain" if enough emigrants return after having strongly improved their skills abroad.
The effect of immigrants' host country language skills.
A second major area of research in Dustmann's work on migration relates to the effect of immigrants' host country language proficiency. Among else, he finds that fluency in German among immigrants increases in education, is lower for the elderly and women, and is only improved by labour market participation in the case of speaking. He also finds that immigrants' fluency in both speaking and especially writing German is associated with higher earnings. In another study, Dustmann observes that immigrants' acquisition of speaking and writing fluency is mostly driven by their parents' education level, whereas living in areas with high concentrations of immigrants has only a moderately negative effect. Furthermore, migrants' investments into language proficiency are shown to depend on whether migrants' intend to immigrate permanently or temporarily. In work with Arthur van Soest, Dustmann finds that the effect of language proficiency on immigrants' earnings was likely underestimated by earlier studies as the downward bias due to measurement errors in subjective language proficiency dominates the upward bias due to heterogeneity in terms of unobserved ability. Finally, together with Francesca Fabbri, Dustmann documents that language acquisition and labour market performance vary widely across non-white immigrants in the UK based on their ethnic origins and that English proficiency significantly increases immigrants' likelihood of employment and earnings.
Natives' attitudes towards immigration.
Together with Ian Preston, Dustmann has analysed the attitudes of ethnic majorities towards ethnic minorities. Among else, they find that earlier research in the UK likely overestimated the positive impact of local immigration on natives' attitudes towards immigrants because they omitted the tendency of xenophobic natives to move to locations with few migrants; instead, they find that, if anything, high concentrations of ethnic minorities likely exacerbated xenophobia in England. With David Card, they also find that xenophobic attitudes among European natives are mainly driven by concerns over how changes in the composition of the local population due to immigration may affect amenities from neighbourhoods, schools and workplaces, instead of concerns over wages and taxes, thus explaining why individuals with lower education tend to display more xenophobic attitudes, as they benefit relatively more from these public amenities than highly educated people. This dominance of welfare concerns over labour market concerns is also supported by earlier work on the UK, though racial and cultural prejudice also plays an important role there, if immigrants have a different ethnicity.
The effects of immigration on host countries and immigrants.
A fourth area in Dustmann's research on migration studies the impact of immigration on domestic labour markets. Therein, together with Fabbri and Preston, Dustmann finds that while immigration in Britain "overall" doesn't appear to have an effect on British natives' employment, labour force participation, unemployment, and wages, immigration in fact likely decreased the employment of medium-skilled natives and increased that of high-skilled natives. In further work with Albrecht Glitz and Tommaso Frattini, Dustmann studies how European countries' labour markets adjusted to recent immigration through changes in factor prices, output mix and production technology. This research is further complemented by work with Glitz, Yann Algan and Alan Manning that compares the performance of first- and second-generation immigrants in France, Germany and the UK in terms of education, earnings and employment, as well as by research with Frattini and Gianandrea Lanzara which shows that even though second-generation immigrants tend to perform worse than natives in terms of education, immigration has a strongly positive on their education relative to that of their peers in their home country. More recently, Dustmann, Frattini and Caroline Halls have also analyzed the fiscal effects of immigration in the UK, finding that European immigrants in general and especially immigrants from post-2004 EU Member States have made consistently positive contributions to the UK's public finances between 1995 and 2011, though the opposite holds true for non-EEA immigrants, in particular before 2000. Finally, together with Frattini and Preston, Dustmann finds that immigrants' move to the UK generally results in a considerable downgrade of their position within the wage distribution, which then in turns depresses slightly wages among the bottom fifth of native workers but increases wages for the upper half.
Other research in labour economics.
In parallel to his research on the economics of migration, Dustmann has also performed influential research on various other topics in labour economics, including wages, job benefits, education, and structural change:

Playing career.
Griffin lettered at Columbia from 1963 to 1965 under Jack Rohan. In his senior season, he averaged 8.8 points per game and 12 rebounds per game, finishing second in the Ivy League in rebounding behind Bill Bradley.
Coaching career.
After two years at Temple Law School, Griffin returned to his alma mater to begin his coaching career as an assistant for the Lions from 1967 to 1970. Griffin was on staff for Columbia's 1968 Ivy League Championship squad in which the team earned a berth in the 1968 NCAA Tournament, the last time the Lions have been to the NCAAs.
In 1970, Griffin accepted an assistant coaching position at RPI, where he was also the school's junior varsity coach. He returned to Columbia for one season to coach the Lions' freshman basketball team before accepting a position at Vermont under fellow Columbia alum Peter Salzberg for the 1974–75 season.
Griffin accepted his first head coaching job as the men's basketball coach at Colgate in 1976 where in six years, he amassed a 61-94 record. During his tenure, Griffin coached 1981 NBA draft pick and ECAC North Player of the Year, Mike Ferrara.
Taking a year off after leaving Colgate, Griffin spent one season as the head men's basketball coach at Thiel College, before returning to RPI as the head men's basketball coach, a position he would hold until 2014. Overall, including one season as the head women's basketball coach for the Engineers, Griffin compiled a 402-382 record, and earned three trips to the Division III NCAA Tournament.
Griffin would spend one season as the head boys basketball coach at the Hoosac School from 2014 to 2015 before stepping aside due to health issues.

2018 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team

The 2018 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team represented the Georgia Institute of Technology during the 2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Yellow Jackets were led by head coach Paul Johnson in his eleventh season on the job. They played their home games at Bobby Dodd Stadium. They competed as a member of the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). They finished the season 7–6, 5–3 in ACC play to finish in second place in the Coastal Division. They were invited to the Quick Lane Bowl where they lost to Minnesota.
On November 28, 2018, Johnson announced his retirement effectively after Georgia Tech's bowl game. On December 7, Temple head coach Geoff Collins, a former grad assistant and recruiting coordinator for Georgia Tech, was named Johnson's successor.

Game summaries.
Alcorn State.
Georgia Tech put up its first shutout in 5 years as they defeated a FCS to open the season.
at South Florida.
Quarterback Blake Barnett of South Florida, formerly the #1 recruit out of high school and transfer from Alabama and Arizona State University rushed and passed for two touchdowns each as USF erased a 10-point deficit late in the 4th quarter to hand Georgia Tech its first loss of the season. It would be USF's 6th win out of 7 chances against Power Five conferences.
at Pittsburgh.
Coming off a stinging loss to Penn State the week before, the Pitt defense rebounded mightily holding Tech to only 386 total yards. Questionable calls by Tech coach Paul Johnson were criticized such as a fake punt call in the first quarter on Tech's own 28-yard line and a 4th-down pass attempt at the Pitt 23-yard line in the 2nd quarter. Johnson later took responsibility for the bad play calls. "If we can't throw a pass that is eight yards and catch it, then that's a bad call," Johnson said. "That was a bad call. It was on me."
Clemson.
Georgia Tech completed just three passes and was held to 146 yards on the ground, nowhere near its nation-high rushing average of 392.7 coming into the game. Trevor Lawrence came into the game in the 2nd quarter and helped Clemson dominate despite Tech cutting the lead down to two touchdowns late in the first half off a TaQuon Marshall touchdown. Much of Bobby Dodd Stadium was filled with roaring Clemson fans on a hot afternoon. Coach Johnson said "we got our tails kicked."
Bowling Green.
Georgia Tech came into the game with the nation's best rushing attack while conversely, Bowling Green came into the game with the worst rushing defense in the nation. With a 41-yard reception in the second quarter, senior wingback Clinton Lynch became the first player in Georgia Tech history to achieve 1,000 career rushing yards (1,138) and 1,000 career receiving yards (1,015) as Tech snapped its 3-game losing streak by dominating FBS Bowling Green.
at Louisville.
Georgia Tech would score on each of its first nine drives, eight of which were for touchdowns, as Tech ran for a season high 542 yards in their first meeting with Louisville. It was Tech's 6th most point total in the modern era and first road win since the 2016 TaxSlayer Bowl.
Duke.
Duke's quarterback Daniel Jones converted three Georgia Tech fumbles late in the 3rd quarter for three touchdowns all in a span of about 3 minutes. It would be Duke's second straight win over Georgia Tech and fourth win in five seasons. Duke Coach David Cutcliffe stated that his squad's preparation to handle Tech's spread option offense starts every spring pre-season.
at Virginia Tech.
For this Thursday night matchup, Virginia Tech had taken a 21–14 lead and forced a punt by Georgia Tech's offense that was fumbled and recovered by Georgia Tech and led to a 12-yard TD drive. GT would dominate from there on Tobias Oliver's first start at QB where Georgia Tech gained 465 yards on offense, all rushing. It was Virginia Tech's most rushing yards given up since 1973 against SMU. That year was also the last time Virginia Tech had given up over 45 points to 3 different teams in one season until Georgia Tech's performance for this game.
at North Carolina.
Georgia Tech quarterback Tobias Oliver rushed for 120 yards and 2 TD while going 2/2 passing for 104 yards and 1 TD. Tech fumbled twice in the 2nd half allowing UNC to rally late and tie the game. Tech retook the lead off Oliver's second rushing touchdown of the game. UNC got the ball back the ensuing drive until Tech defensive lineman Anree Saint-Amour dropped back in coverage and intercepted UNC's Nathan Elliott's pass to halt their penultimate drive with 2:44 left. Tech would drive down and kick a field goal with 46 seconds left to seal the win.
Miami (FL).
Georgia Tech came out on top in what ended up being an atypical game with Miami that included a fumbled kickoff return, a muffed punt, and less than 110 combined plays. Miami received the opening kickoff and moved easily down the field for a 7–0 lead before Tech matched it. The fumbled kickoff followed shortly after, giving Tech the ball near the Miami red zone. After scoring to take a 14–7 lead, Tech was able to force a Miami punt. Tech was held to a 3 and out and punted back to Miami. The Tech defense forced a short 3rd and 1, which led Miami to go under center for one of the few times that night. Miami fumbled the snap and Tech recovered the ball on the Miami 39. Tech ended this drive in a field goal, making the score 17–7. On Miami's next drive, the Canes had a 3rd and 30+ due to penalties. As expected, this led to a punt for Miami. Not so expected was the low, rugby-style kick that never reached 10 feet from the ground, but was able to contact Tech's Nathan Cottrell, who was running down the field to block for the returner. Miami quickly jumped on the ball and was given a renewed set of downs, which they turned into a touchdown to make the score 17–14 Tech shortly before half time. Tech's drive to open the 3rd quarter resulted in a 3 and out, leading to the second of 3 GT punts on the night. The punt was further than the Miami returner was expecting, which caused him to attempt a catch over his shoulder. The returner muffed the punt and was pushed out of the way by GT's Juanyeh Thomas, who recovered the ball at the Miami 10-yard line. Tech was held to a field goal on the short field to make the score 20–14. Miami was then held to a 3 and out, which was followed by a Tech drive for a touchdown (27–14), scored on a 31-yard pass from Taquon Marshall to Brad Stewart. Miami was forced to punt again after a 6-play drive, giving Tech the ball just before the 4th quarter. Tech was forced to punt, but only after they bled 5 minutes off the clock. Miami then scored a touchdown, making the score 27–21, but leaving only 6:43 on the clock. Georgia Tech was then able to close out the game by converting 3 3rd downs, including an impressive 22-yard pass to Jalen Camp, and an 11-yard run from Jerry Howard. With the win, GT became bowl eligible.
Virginia.
In the span of just 11 seconds, Georgia Tech turned an early 7–3 deficit into a 13–7 lead. Virginia, backed up on its own 1 after a punt, had its quarterback Bryce Perkins take a snap in the end zone and rolled left to throw, only to be grabbed by Georgia Tech's Brant Mitchell and finished off by 325-pound nose tackle Brandon Adams for a safety. Juanyeh Thomas then returned the free kick 77 yards for a touchdown and Marshall ran for a 2-point conversion. The safety injured Perkins in what seemed as a serious injury at the time, but only wound up keeping him out of the game for one series.
After several lead changes, Georgia Tech's Brad Stewart caught the only pass of the game for the Yellow Jackets on a 3rd down to extend the drive and set up a field goal by Wesley Wells to go ahead late in the 4th quarter. Virginia would storm back down the field and kick a game-tying field goal by Brian Delaney towards the end of regulation to set up an overtime contest. Virginia won the toss and held Tech to a field goal. After Tech forced a field goal attempt on Virginia's part, Delaney kicked the ball wide left after a no call on false start by the Virginia offensive line resulting in a Georgia Tech victory.
The win guaranteed Georgia Tech's 2nd-place finish in the ACC Coastal division as Pitt had clinched the division earlier that day with a win over Wake Forest.
at Georgia.
Georgia Tech came in to Athens, GA defending a 2-game win streak in the home of the Bulldogs, but were limited to a season low in rushing yards. UGA scored on every drive of the first half all with different personnel. UGA pulled some of their first string starters in the 2nd half which led Tech to have some late touchdowns, but was not able to get over the insurmountable Georgia lead. The victory, combined with a #4 ranked Michigan loss to Ohio State propelled Georgia into #4 in the country heading into the 2018 SEC Championship Game against Alabama.
Days after the defeat, Coach Paul Johnson of Georgia Tech announced his retirement pending the conclusion of Tech's bowl game at the end of the season.

Jonas Balan

Jonas Balan (born 1956) is a Haitian metal artist and the head of family business in Croix-des-Bouquets, Haiti. He works alongside his four siblings to create and sell their art. Jonas Balan’s work includes metal images such as mermaids, children playing, and spiritual figures. He has also recently made geckos and painted sculptures. When it comes to colors he works with reds, yellows, oranges and aquatic blues, greens, and purples.
Biography and family.
Jonas Balan has three brothers (Julio, Joel, and Romel) and one sister (Mirtha) who were born in the village of Noailles. The brothers continue to work together to create art from metal drum pieces. They depict Vodou spirits in their work, particularly "Agwe", master of the sea (represented by a boat), and "Marasa" (twins associated with children and procreation).
Haitian metal sculpture goes back to the late 1940s. A blacksmith named Georges Liautaud started making decorative metal crosses for a local cemetery and then metal sculptures depicting the Vodou spirits. Liautaud started off with iron and then expanded to using discarded petrochemical steel drums, which Haiti had a large supply of. Liautaud took on apprentices that included John Sylyvestre. Sylyvestre then trained the Balan family. Sylyvestre and the Balan family shared a "lakou", or compound. Jonas Balan’s sister, Mirtha, is also a metal sculptor. She is a woman who is in a male-dominated craft. She learned alongside her brothers and now owns her own business.
The process.
Artists, such as Jonas, use metal drums to create sculptures. To prepare the drum, the artist starts by removing the ends (which can be used from smaller sculptures). A vertical slit is cut along the length of the cylinder using a hammer and a chisel. The artist then stuffs the drum with straw and paper, which is set on fire to burn off any paint or chemical residue. After the drum cools, it is flattened by climbing on top of the drum and use all his weight and strength to pull it apart. The whole sheet of metal would then be hammered to make the metal softer and easier to work with. Jonas would then draw on his designs using chalk and be cut out.

Beverly Magennis

Beverley Magennis (born 1942) is a ceramic sculptor who works within the nexus of tile and architectural form. 
Early life.
Born in Toronto, Beverley Magennis is a self-described feminist who covers architectural forms in ceramic tiles. 
Magennis received her AOCA from the Ontario College of Art in Toronto in 1964 and received her MA in Ceramics from the Claremont Graduate School and University Center in California in 1968.
Magennis came to New Mexico in the 1970s as a part of Roswell's Artist-in-Residence program, and taught art in Chama, New Mexico. 
Career.
She has worked in Los Angeles, where she was inspired by outsider artists, and throughout New Mexico, in Roswell, Albuquerque, and southwestern New Mexico. Magennis has tiled the interiors and exteriors of homes, including her own, with tiles, pennies, and mosaics, creating a "transformation of nonart materials into aestheticized objects." She also sculpts representational forms or repurposes commercial tiles which she fractures the tiles into abstract designs. She is well-known for her ceramic-tiled chairs, which usually include cats or birds, held in the collections of the New Mexico Museum of Art in Santa Fe, and the Albuquerque Museum of Art and History. She is noted for her quirky style fusing California modernism, breaking down barriers of high and low art through her tiled and mosaic artwork.
Literary career.
After moving back to Albuquerque from Catron County, New Mexico, Beverley began writing a series of books, under the name Bev Magennis, about life in Catron County. The first book, "Alibi Creek", was published by Torrey House Press in March 2016. Subsequent books comprise the series "Alibi Creek Tales" which includes "Desplazado," "Equity," "Nothing Fancy," and "Walker Walker."
Works.
Her home is considered an Albuquerque landmark, known as The Tile House, and was created during an 11-year period from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. It now belongs to Beverly's daughter, Erin Magennis, and her husband Kyle Ray, both artists carrying on the mosaic tradition. The mosaics on the exterior of the house includes over 150,000 tiles, as well as pennies, mirrors, cereal boxes, plastic straws, bottle caps, and cigarette lighters, in fractured rows and grids, modernizing the ancient technique of mosaic through a Warholian reuse of common materials. The interior of the house is governed by the same opportunistic reuse of materials, noted by visitors. The house is on the Cultural Registry of the City of Albuquerque.
The Dome Lady, which stands 26 feet tall, and around 19 feet wide is a guest house located in Apache Creek, New Mexico. With a concrete foundation, its skirt is reinforced with rebar concrete walls and the torso is constructed of metal lathe. The exterior is decorated in mosaic tile, with an entrance and windows. The torso is constructed has a bondo finish and is painted. The stucco interior contains a small kitchen, mosaic countertops, dining table, and sleeping quarters.
The 22 foot high mosaic sculpture, Tree of Life, created in 1999 and located at Fourth Street and Montano Rd. in North Valley, Albuquerque, New Mexico, is an artwork referencing the early peoples of Mexico and New Mexico, with black and white aminal images referencing Native American Mimbres pottery, as well as color figures from the Maya culture.
Mexican Hat, installed in 1997 on the City and County Building in Albuquerque, New Mexico, is a black and white lithograph print with two boxes, one with flowers, the other with a Mexican sombrero done in an illustrative style.
The Full Circle, located in Zia Park, Albuquerque, New Mexico, dates to 1990, and is another great example of her public mosaic sculptural installation works. It incorporates a ceramic tiled round bench surrounded by a low ceramic tiled wall, with a rainbow motif and other whimsical Native American symbols and figure, integrating into the adjacent playgrounds and Zia Elementary School.
Untitled (Chairs), are held in the New Mexico Museum of Art in Santa Fe, and were created in 2000. They are ceramic mosaic on cement sculpture and installed outside the museum. The floral motifs integrate into the grassy courtyard in which they are installed; "combining seemingly naive subject matter with a sophisticated sense of design and quirky sense of humor."
Patio Chair with Black Cat, held in the Albuquerque Museum of Art and History, was created in 1999 and features her signature ceramic mosaic, heavy sculptural architectonic style, and decorative motifs.

Lallinger Winkel

The Lallinger Winkel is a high valley, 162 km² in area, named after the village of Lalling, in the county of Deggendorf in the Bavarian Forest.
The region opens into the Danube plain to the southeast but is delimited to the northwest, north and east by the mountain ridges of the Danube Hills which keep at bay the cold winds and rain. Apart from Lalling, the Lallinger Winkel also extends into the municipalities of Schaufling and Hunding.
In the south near Auerbach the Lallinger Winkel is adjoined by the Hengersberg-Schwanenkirchen Tertiary Bay. From a geological view, the region is a section of the southern Bohemian Massif. Its rocks include various gneisses and granites.
The region around Lalling was developed as early as the foundation phase of Niederaltaich Abbey in the 8th century. During the 150-year initial period of clearances, many villages were built in the Lallinger Winkel. The abbey used the favourable climatic conditions for orchards and encouraged the settlers to grow apples, pears and peaches.
From 1861 to 1904 Lalling was the centre of a district fruit nursery. Even today the Lallinger Winkel is characterised by orchards and is called the 'fruit basket of the Bavarian Forest' ("Obstschüssel des Bayerischen Waldes"). Many small villages grow the traditional scattered orchards ("Streuobstwiesen"). The initiative Scattered Orchards Beyond the Year 2000 ("Streuobstanbau über das Jahr 2000") led to new plantings of thousands of standard fruit trees and the establishment of the freely accessible scattered orchard experience garden in Panholling, Hunding. Especially when the trees are in bloom or at harvest time, the orchards in the Lallinger Winkel are important for tourism. Also well known are the Lallingen snowdrop meadows ("Lallinger Schneeglöckerlwiese") and spring snowflakes.

A version of the legislation passed the Indiana General Assembly, but without language requiring that the stadium be home to a Major League Soccer team.
In 2020, Sandlin criticized the Marion County prosecutor on their decision to stop prosecuting marijuana possession cases in the country, and supported legislation that would allow the Indiana Attorney General to override county prosecutors' authority and discretion.

Eddie Durham's All-Star Girl Orchestra

Eddie Durham's All-Star Girl Orchestra was an African-American all-female band started by arranger Eddie Durham in January 1942. By November, the All-Stars were a part of Moe Gale's New York agency. The group was also known as "Eddie Durham's All-Girl Band" and performed throughout the country and internationally. The All-Stars typically had between eighteen and twenty-two members and pulled musicians from other popular bands of the time, including The Harlem Playgirls and The International Sweethearts of Rhythm.
History.
Popularity.
Starting July 9, 1943, the All-Star Girl Orchestra traveled throughout the United States and Canada performing, with concerts at cities, such as Columbus, South Carolina and Atlanta, Georgia and USO dates. The All-Stars were very popular during World War II and performed at United Service Organization (USO) Camp Shows. They dedicated at least one night per week on the war effort and their activities included raising war bonds, uplifting morale, and performing at military camps and USO centers. During their time together, they performed at seventy-two army camps throughout Canada. Unlike other bands that struggled to find funding during restrictive war times, the All-Stars had luxury buses adapt with hot and cold water, air conditioning, and sleeping accommodations. The band also received government supplied gas coupons. They had enough money because of Mary McLeod Bethune. She was the founder of the National Council of Negro Women and Bethune-Cook College. Mary McLeod Bethune received permission from Eleanor Roosevelt to allow the bus to travel anywhere. The All-Stars played at popular venues including the Paramount Theater, Apollo Theater, and Howard Theater, and were even invited to perform on Broadway in New York City. The All-Stars were repeat guests at the Apollo Theater. They performed in 1942 in February, September, and June, October 1943, and April 1944. At times, they performed with other popular acts including Ella Fitzgerald, Moms Mabley, and comedian duo Butterbeans and Susie.
Folding.
In 1945, after VJ day, the All-Stars were supposed to perform at Sweets' Ballroom in Oakland, California. After performing for one week, they disbanded because the male musicians were returning to the United States. Durham ensured each member returned home. Durham trained singer Jean Parks to take over the All-Stars. The band was then titled Jean Parks's All Star-Girl Band. However, the band officially ended less than a year later after Parks fell ill. Many of the former All-Star members went on to join other bands, including Lorraine Brown Guilford's Darlings of Rhythm.
Line Up.
The line-up of the All-Stars changed throughout its history.

In an interview with "América Televisión", Díaz explained that although she would prefer to stay away from politics, she supported her husband and his political future, telling the network, "I never liked it very much, because politics is politics, right? But if he wanted it and he wanted to do it, I have to support him..."

Ruan Dacheng

Ruan Dacheng ( 1587–1646) was a Chinese dramatist, poet and official during the Ming dynasty. His daughter, Ruan Lizhen, was also a dramatist. 
Ruan grew up in Huaining County, Anqing. He became a "jinshi" in 1616 and began a career as an official. Ruan aligned himself with the faction of the eunuch Wei Zhongxian and, after Wei fell from favour and committed suicide, was removed from office. He then retired to live as a hermit and it is believed that most of his literary production was undertaken during this time. 
In 1644, after the fall of Beijing to the invading Manchus, he became an official of the Southern Ming dynasty through the influence of his close friend Ma Shiying. In 1645 he surrendered to the Manchus.
After his death he was reviled as a traitor and he is a villain in Kong Shangren's "The Peach Blossom Fan". 
He was a patron of the garden designer Ji Cheng.

Athyma recurva

Athyma recurva is a butterfly found in the Palearctic that belongs to the browns 
family. It is endemic to China (West China and Tibet).
Description from Seitz.
P. recurva Leech (59c). Similar to the preceding ["Athyma disjuncta" Leech, 1890], but the cell-spots of the forewing 
different and the exterior macular band of the hindwing is nearer the margin. Underside red-brown, the spots as above, but
better developed, on the hindwing there runs a white curved stripe along the costal vein from the base to the
first spot of the discal band, which it sometimes joins. The edges of the band rather straight, but the exterior
edge may also be dentate, otherwise only transected by the dark veins. The female is larger and bears enlarged
white spots. Appears to be very rare. — West China: Moupin, Wa-shan, in June.

Steve Salerno

Steve Salerno is an American nonfiction author, essayist and educator best known for his 2005 critique of the self-help movement, SHAM: How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless. The book received a mostly enthusiastic critical reception, though some reviewers accused Salerno of overreach in his analysis of self-help's broader effects in society. In the book, Salerno argues that far from being merely an innocuous fad, self-help in recent decades has done significant damage to the American social fabric. Salerno ties that damage principally to self-esteem based education and the fallout from the two polar schools of self-help thoughts, Victimization and Empowerment. He is highly critical of Alcoholics Anonymous and derivative 12-step programs. He has also described the self-help movement's intrusion into politics. He and ABC's Dan Harris developed an hour-long PrimeTime special on the sweat lodge deaths caused by guru James Arthur Ray.
In the book, Salerno discusses Tony Robbins, Dr. Phil, Dr. Laura and a number of the other visible leaders of the personal-growth movement. He also explains Oprah Winfrey's role as a seminal figure in the movement. In the intervening years, Salerno has written numerous essays and reported pieces that followed the careers of major gurus after the book's publication and tracked their wider influence in American life in terms of politics, medicine and other areas. He is particularly notable for his work debunking the 2007 blockbuster book and DVD The Secret.
Other works.
Salerno's 1987 book "Deadly Blessing" chronicled the life and untimely death of Texas favorite son Price Daniel Jr. The book was put to screen by Warner Bros. as TV movie "Bed of Lies", starring Susan Dey and Chris Cooper. His first book "The Newest Profession" (1985), described the spread of high-powered sales techniques throughout society.
As an essayist, Salerno specializes in long-form personal experience pieces, like this piece on his lifelong obsession with the batting cages. In recent years Salerno has also emerged as a leading critic of political correctness and academic policies on same, writing variously for the Wall Street Journal, Quillette, USA Today and other publications.
Academic career.
Salerno spent several years as a visiting professor of journalism at Indiana University, and has taught at the adjunct level at Lehigh University and currently at University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). He also spent a year as writer-in-residence at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, PA.

Irish Landmark Trust

The Irish Landmark Trust is an architectural conservation and educational organisation founded in Ireland in 1992. Similar to the British Landmark Trust (founded in 1965), it is a registered charity which renovates buildings of historic interest and makes them available for holiday rental, while collating and sharing information on construction and restoration techniques. As of 2018, the organisation had restored over 30 properties on the island of Ireland, including a number of lighthouses and castles.
History.
Following meetings hosted by the chairperson of the then "Crafts Council of Ireland", Terry Kelly, the Irish Landmark Trust was established in the Republic of Ireland in 1992. It was established in Northern Ireland in 1996. Early funding of the charity included input from Chuck Feeney's Atlantic Philanthropies foundation.
After three years in operation, the charity opened its first property, Wicklow Head Lighthouse, which it had acquired as a hollow shell. 
In June 2017, the organisation celebrated its 25th anniversary at Castletown House.
Goal and approach.
The organisation's main stated aim is to "conserve and sustain iconic buildings", primarily "architecturally significant small buildings". It characterises itself as an educational trust, making the historic buildings accessible to the public, and documenting and sharing original construction techniques and modern restoration approaches. It uses a panel of conservation architects and local tradespeople in restoration projects. 
Maintenance and restoration works are funded by income generated from holiday rentals, as well as from State and other funding sources. In return for supporting the cost of renovation works, property owners provide the Irish Landmark Trust with a long term lease on the property – which later reverts to the owner; the lease may be for an owner's lifetime, or, typically, fifty years.
Organisation.
The organisation is overseen by non-executive trustees, as of 2020, 14 including the organisation's chairperson. As a not-for-profit operation, it maintains charitable status for its companies in both jurisdictions on the island of Ireland. Historian Nicholas Robinson (previously associated with the Irish Architectural Archive) was the first chairperson of the organisation, and was the president of the trust as of 2017. The chairperson as of 2020 is Mary Hanna.
It has a staff of approximately 5 administrative and 25 property management personnel, reporting to a CEO. As of 2020, the CEO is Mary O'Brien.
Funding.
Aside from the early Atlantic Philanthropies funds, the trust established an early relationship with the Heritage Council, and had for many years both a basic "stipend" from the council, and access to "Building at Risk" funds. It also received some local council conservation grants. Remaining funding came from a combination of the rental income of the portfolio of properties and private fundraising (a number of major Irish businesses are credited as donors). 
The charity also operates a "membership" scheme for what it terms "Landmarkers." The scheme, which does not involve membership of the charitable companies, primarily comprises three levels of regular donation and direct benefits include advance notice of special offers, and member-only viewing and educational events. Furniture and other items of use in restoration are also donated.
In 2014, the charity reported that the "core" funding from the Heritage Council was reduced by 30%, and the other grants had largely ceased, leading to a temporary stop to work on new buildings, funding from which had been 70% grant-based, to focus remaining funds on maintenance of existing rental stock. Overall grant income in the Republic of Ireland in 2017 was under 300,000 euro, alongside over 500,000 euro in donations, while grant income in Northern Ireland was negligible, but over 200,000 pounds came in from fundraising.
Properties.
As of 2018, the trust's 32 properties, of which 31 are available to rent, include a number of towers, gate lodges, thatched cottages, castles, lighthouses and at least one schoolhouse. The Trust's Temple Bar Georgian townhouse was withdrawn from letting in 2017, pending remedial works. Towers and castles managed by the organisation include Helen's Tower in County Down, and Clomantagh Castle in County Kilkenny, the oldest property held as of 2018. Lighthouses and lighthouse cottages renovated by the organisation include several at Galley Head Lighthouse in County Cork, Blackhead Lighthouse in County Antrim, and Wicklow Head Lighthouse. 
The taking on of new properties has been limited in the late 2010s, with the trust commenting in 2018 that it was having to turn down increasing numbers of offered properties due to funding limitations. As of April 2018 just one new project, at Elizabeth Fort in County Cork, was being actively renovated, and it was completed later that year. At the same time, two projects, one in the Phoenix Park and one involving the Saunderscourt Gate Lodges in Co. Wexford, were in planning.

The Mynde

The Mynde is a Grade I listed country house in the village of Much Dewchurch, Herefordshire, England which dates from the 15th century. 
Originally constructed in the 15th and 16th century it was remodelled in the 18th century and recast in the 19th century by William Atkinson. Built of sandstone rubble and brick, it is stuccoed on three sides. It has a rectangular floor plan with rear projecting wings to the west and an east facing frontage and is built in 3 storeys with a hipped Welsh slate roof. The main front elevation has 9 bays, with the central five bays slightly projecting, with a porch flanked by Doric columns supporting an entablature. 
It stands in a 1,180-acre estate and is approached along a mile-long private 'carriage drive' with views of the gardens, lake and the surrounding Herefordshire countryside.
History.
The estate had descended in the Pye family since the Norman conquest and was their family seat in Tudor times. Amongst the Pye owners of the property were the lawyer and Elizabethan courtier Walter Pye I and the Royalist courtier Walter Pye II.
In 1709 the Duke of Chandos acquired the house and added the striking Kings Hall with plasterwork by Bugatti and Attari. 
In 1740 it was purchased by Richard Symons of London. He was succeeded by his only surviving child, Anna Sophia Symons, who married Richard Peers. On inheriting the estate, their son, also Richard Peers, M.P., adopted the name Symons, and was created a baronet in 1774, but died unmarried in 1796, after which the estate passed to his sister's grandson Thomas Raymond, who likewise adopted the Symons name and arms. The estate then descended in the direct male line of the Symons family to Thomas Edward Raymond Symons (d. 1928), on whose death it was sold to a fellow army officer, Henry Ambrose Clive, younger son of General Edward Henry Clive of Perrystone Court, Herefordshire. In 1959 the estate was bought by William Anthony Twiston-Davies (d. 1989); his son, Audley, completed a restoration of the main house between 1997 and 2001, and put the property on the market in 2013.
In 2016 the property was sold for £15m.

Džemma Skulme

Džemma Lija Skulme (20 September 1925 – 9 November 2019) was a Latvian artist and modernist painter. Džemma Skulme's personality played a paramount role in Latvian art development and social life of Latvia in the second half of the 20th century.
Biography.
Džemma Lija Skulme came from the Skulme family of artists. She was the daughter of Latvian painter Oto Skulme (1889-1967) and Latvia's first woman sculptor Marta Liepiņa - Skulme (1890–1962). Oto, Marta, and Džemma's uncle Uga Skulme were members of the Riga Artists Group who determined the development of art in Latvia in the 1930s.
In 1949 Džemma Skulme graduated from the Art Academy of Latvia pictorial art department and the 1955 Repin Art Institute. From 1956 she was an Artists’ Union of Latvia member and was its chair from 1982-1992. In 1976 she was given the honorary title of People's Artist of the Latvian SSR. Since 1993 she was the president of Jaunrades Foundation. In 1992 she was elected honorary member of the Latvian Academy of Sciences, and received an honorary doctor degree from the Art Academy of Latvia in 1998. In recognition of her work, the Latvian Art Higher Education Institutions Association honoured her with the degree Dr. honoris causa for her contribution to Latvian culture.
Art.
Džemma Skulme worked in oil, acrylic and water-colours. Beginning in the 1970s she developed the theme of the caryatid, wherein she endeavored to reveal the ethical and spiritual strength of a woman ("The Women of Nica", 1968; "Caryatid", 1979, and others). She also turned to a rifleman theme, Latvian ethnography and the principles of folk art. In her paintings of the second half of 1960s her worldview became more dramatic and she has raised the expressiveness of her work by using large brush or even palette knife for colour application. In pieces like "Marta in Mask" (1973), "Valentīns Skulme as Richard III" (1974), and "Dialogue" (1975) the artist depicts with spontaneous ease dramatic or heroic images full of life and spirit. In the middle of 1950s she also became recognized for her book and magazine illustrations.
During 1960s artist turns to author technique - combination of acrylic and oil colour thus creating interesting textures. Her painting during this time has become more conceptual. During latest decades Džemma is using naive stylistics of children drawings to create vivid and painterly virtuoso artworks. She has worked as assistant decorator in Daile Theatre and Latvia Puppet Theatre (1945-1947).
The Latvian art historian Laima Slava is accentuating the line as the discovery of 1960s in Džemma Skulme's creative work: “At first it is smooth and constructive and defines the shape of a character, then it becomes lighter and more transparent.”

His first work was , the song was written in Semarang on September 7, 1944 and was first introduced to the public in January 1945, a few months before the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence on August 17, 1945. Through the song of Syukur, Mutahar wanted to reveal a great praise and affirm to the listener that the homeland of Indonesia which will soon be free is a gift of God.
His second song was created in 1946 under the title . The song was created in the toilet of Hotel Garuda Yogyakarta, at that time he was roommate with Hoegeng Iman Santoso who are both in charge of escorting Sukarno. Hoegeng confused to find paper and pens because Mutahar rushed to pour his ideas onto the paper. Hari Merdeka is often played on the anniversary of the Proclamation. In addition, the song of Syukur and Hari Merdeka was ever reworked by Addie MS with a philharmonic orchestra in Australia.

Together with 5 other youths with him as the escorts, he raised the Bendera Pusaka (the Flag of Indonesia) just as Indonesia Raya was played by a military band to a joyful populace. It would be repeated again in 1947 and 1949.
With the transfer of the capital to Jakarta, Mutahar did not see any flag raising ceremonies until 1966 at the Merdeka Palace but the flag raising method still remained. In 1967, he advised then President Suharto on the formation of the "Pasukan Pengibar Bendera Pusaka" or National Heirloom Flag Hoisting Troop, with a mission to escort, hoist and lower the flag during Independence Day and other national holiday celebrations in the national and regional levels. In time for the 22nd Independence Day, his suggestion was accepted. The Pasikbraka of today traces its origin to the 70-man color party that was formed for the 1967 Independence Day national flag ceremonies, he was the first mentor of the unit and helped chose and train its first generation personnel.

2018 Charlotte 49ers football team

The 2018 Charlotte 49ers football team represented the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in the 2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The 49ers played their home games at Jerry Richardson Stadium in Charlotte, NC, and competed in the East Division of Conference USA (C–USA). They were led by sixth-year head coach Brad Lambert. They finished the season 5–7, 4–4 in C-USA play to finish in fourth place in the East Division.
On November 18, head coach Brad Lambert was fired. He was allowed to stay on to coach their final game of the season. Lambert, who was the first and only coach Charlotte had in their history to that point, finished with a six-year record of 22–48.
On December 5, Charlotte hired Austin Peay head coach Will Healy for the job.
Previous season.
The 49ers finished the 2017 season 1–11, 1–7 in C-USA play to finish in last place in the East Division.
Coaching staff.
Following the disappointing one win season, there was speculation that Brad Lambert would be released. Charlotte Chancellor Phillip Dubois and athletics director Judy Rose issued a statement just days after the final game informing the community that Lambert would be retained for the following season. Lambert shook up his staff, firing defensive coordinator Matt Wallerstedt, quarterbacks coach and former offensive coordinator Jeff Mullen and receivers coach Damien Gary. Greg Adkins had replaced Mullen as offensive coordinator mid-season but went back to only having responsibility for the offensive line and running backs and would soon resign to join the staff at conference rival Marshall. Before the end of the year Youngstown State offensive coordinator and former Miami of Ohio head coach Shawn Montgomery would be called in to serve as the 49ers' play caller on offense. In February, former Oklahoma State defensive coordinator Glenn Spencer took the same position on the 49ers' staff. Charlie Shalaski took over responsibility for receivers at the same time. A week later Howard co-defensive coordinator Chip West would join the staff to serve as co-defensive coordinator with Spencer, with Spencer being responsible for linebackers and West being in charge of Cornerbacks. Graduate assistant Brad Queen would move up to the coaching staff to coach defensive tackles. Former Tulane head coach Chris Scelfo joined the staff before the Spring Game to serve as the 49ers offensive line coach and run game coordinator. James Adams's promotion to assistant head coach before the Spring Game rounded out the staff changes for the upcoming 2018 season.

Game summaries.
Fordham Rams.
Lightning delayed the start of the game for over an hour and both teams started off slowly after the delay. Charlotte took a one score lead into the halftime period, which saw another lightning delay force a temporary evacuation of the stadium. Fordham would get the score down to a field goal difference, but the Charlotte offense would finally pull away late with three consecutive touchdowns to end the game nearly five and a half hours after its scheduled start time.
Top performances for the game were narrowly dominated by the 49ers. Quarterback Chris Reynolds threw for 267 yards and a touchdown. Rusher Benny LeMay had 25 carries for 135 yards and two touchdowns. Victor Tucker had 7 receptions for 127 yards and a touchdown.
Game notes:
Appalachian State Mountaineers.
These two in-state schools met for the first time on the gridiron in this clash that saw high local interest. App, coming off a near upset win at ranked Penn State the previous weekend wanted to make a statement. They kept the Niners out of the endzone for the entire game. All nine of the Niners points came in the second quarter and from greater than 46 yards away off the foot of Jonathan Cruz. The game was still in reach at halftime, but three second half touchdowns sealed the victory for the Mountaineers.
Top performers for the game include App State quarterback Zach Thomas, who passed for 295 yards and two touchdowns. Both teams defenses were stingy on the ground. App's Jalin Moore and Charlotte's Benny LeMay had similar rushing states with Moore having 11 carries for 38 yards, and LeMay getting 35 yards on 7 carries. App's Corey Xavier Sutton had 3 receptions for 155 yards and two touchdowns.
Game notes:
Old Dominion Monarchs.
Due to the expected effects of Hurricane Florence along the eastern seaboard this game, originally scheduled for Saturday, September 15, was move up two days earlier to Thursday, September 13. Both teams would trade scores throughout the game but Charlotte would finish with the most to secure the conference opener victory and end the three-game season=opening home stand at two wins, one loss.
Top performers for the game were Charlotte quarterback Chris Reynolds who threw for 202 yards and two touchdowns. Old Dominions' Lala Davis rushed for 63 yards on 25 carriers earning two touchdowns. The Monarch' Jonathan Duhart had 7 receptions for 127 yards and a touchdown.
Game notes:
Massachusetts Minutemen.
Charlotte's first visit to the State of Massachusetts didn't go quite as they had planned. Giving up a devastating three touchdowns in the first three and a half minutes of the game, including an opening kickoff 93-yard return, a fumble recovery which one play later added another touchdown for the Minutemen, and a blocked punt that three plays later added the third UMass touchdown, would prove insurmountable for the Niners to overcome. Though the Niners would eventually find their offense and trade scores with the Minutement for the final three quarters of the game, the four first quarter touchdowns the Niners gave up proved to be the difference in the final score.
Top performers for the game included Charlotte quarterback Chris Reynolds, who passed for 283 yards and three touchdowns. UMass rusher Marquis Young had 12 carries for 77 yards and two touchdowns. The Minutemen's' Andy Isabella had 6 receptions for 85 yards and a touchdown.
Game notes:
First game for the program in the State of Massachusetts.
UAB Blazers.
Though a mostly defensive struggle, the eventual C-USA Champions never let the Niners get into their offensive groove, denying them a scoring chance until the fourth quarter. UAB would get the home win to avenge their previous season loss to the Niners, which had been the Niners' only win the previous season.
UAB quarterback A.J. Erdely passed for 214 yards and a touchdown. The Blazers' Spencer Brown had 18 carries for 68 yards and two touchdowns. Blazers' receiver Andre Wilson made the most of his two catches with 67 yards and a touchdown.
Game notes:
WKU Hilltoppers.
The struggling Hilltoppers rolled into Charlotte for the first time to take on the 49ers at home. The game was low scoring and close at halftime, but Charlotte soon found their offensive stride in the third quarter to put the game well out of reach.
Top performers for the game included Charlotte quarterback Chris Reynolds, who threw for 119 yards before a season-ending leg injury took him out of the game. Charlotte's Benny LeMay had 17 carries for 1231 yards and two touchdowns. Charlotte's Victor Tucker had 9 receptions for 91 yards.
Game notes:
Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders.
Charlotte would score first and take that lead into the second quarter, but by halftime the Blue Raiders would add two touchdowns of their own. Neither team found points in the third quarter but a costly Charlotte fumble on their own goal line would let the Blue Raider defense score. Charlotte would tack on another touchdown near the end of regulation but it wouldn't be enough to get a win as Charlotte's road woes continued.
Top performers included Middle Tennessee quarterback Brent Stockstill who passed for 111 yards, all three of the Blue Raiders' touchdowns, and an interception. Charlotte's Benny LeMay had 19 carries for 129 yards and a touchdown. Middle Tennessee's Ty Lee had 6 receptions for 60 yards and two touchdowns.
Game notes:
Southern Miss Golden Eagles.
Charlotte would take an early two touchdown lead in the first quarter, helped by a timely Juwan Foggie interception return on what looked otherwise like a scoring drive for the Golden Eagles. Charlotte held Southern Miss scoreless at the half. Both teams would tack on field goals in the third quarter before Southern Miss finally found the endzone in the fourth quarter. The Golden Eagles would add another touchdown late in the game but a 53-yard fourth quarter field goal from Jonathan Cruz proved to be the difference maker for the Niner's to get the home win.
Top performers for the game included Southern Miss quarterback Jack Abraham, who despite throwing 3 interceptions managed to gain 210 yards for the Golden Eagle through the air. Charlotte's Benny LeMay continued his march to a 1000-yard season with 19 carries for 62 yards. The Golden Eagles' Tim Jones had 5 receptions for 96 yards.
Game notes:
Tennessee Volunteers.
Early on it looked like the game would get out of hand as the Volunteers gained a two touchdown lead in the first quarter, but Charlotte's 6th place nationally ranked run defense would hold the traditional SEC power to negative running yardage well into the fourth quarter. Tennessee would finish the game with only 20 yards on the ground, but the Tennessee defense was able to keep the Niners from finding the endzone.
Top performers of the game included Tennessee quarterback Jarrett Guarantano, who threw for 172 yards and a touchdown. Charlotte's Benny LeMay had 24 carries for 81 yards, single-handedly quadrupling the total team rushing yardage of the Volunteers. Tennessee's Josh Palmer had 5 receptions for 71 yards and a touchdown.
Game notes:
Marshall Thundering Herd.
The game would stay a tight scoring affair with the Niner's evening the game up early in the third quarter, But Marshall would add two touchdowns and a field goal before the end of the quarter to earn the home victory and keeping the Niners winless on the road for the season.
Top performances for the game were Marshall quarterback Isaiah Green, with 178 passing yards and a touchdown. The Herd's Brendan Knox had 22 carries for 116 yards and a touchdown. Thundering Herd receiver Tyre Brady had 6 receptions for 95 yards.
Game notes:
FIU Panthers.
With the Panthers still in the hunt for the East Division crown and a chance to make the Conference USA Championship Game on the line, the 49ers faced a tall order on Senior Day. The two teams would trade leads with the Panthers heading in at the half with a one score lead. Despite a dominating ground performance from Charlotte rusher Benny LeMay, the Niners wouldn't find the lead again, but always managed to keep it within one score. A final on-sides recovery attempt failed and the Niners lost their second and last home game of the season.
Top performers for the game included Panthers' quarterback James Morgan, who threw for 268 yards and 2 touchdowns. Charlotte's Benny LeMay would rack up four touchdowns and 159 yards on 30 carries. Charlotte's Victor Tucker had 4 receptions for 115 yards.
Game notes:
Florida Atlantic Owls.
The defending Conference USA Champions were looking to extend their season by becoming bowl eligible off of a fifth straight win. The Niners were looking for their first road win and to send their seniors and their head coach out as victors. It looked like the Owls would have the upper hand early when they scored on the very first play from scrimmage, however the Niners would have the lead heading into the second quarter. The Owls had their biggest lead of the game heading into halftime, but in the second half Charlotte would battle back to retake the lead early in the fourth quarter. The Owls would tie the game up with a little more than three minutes left on the clock, but Charlotte kicker and two time Conference USA Special Teams Player of the Week Jonathan Cruz would hit a decisive 56 yard field goal with under half a minute left on the clock to give the Niners their only road win of the season.
Top performers of the game included Florida Atlantic passer Chris Robinson who threw for 273 yards and 2 touchdowns. Charlotte's Benny LeMay capped a stellar season with 24 carries for 173 yards and a touchdown. The Owls' Kerrith Whyte Jr. had 3 receptions for 92 yards and a touchdown.

Types of prostitution in modern Japan

Prostitution in modern Japan, as defined under Japanese law, is the illegal practice of sexual intercourse with an 'unspecified' (unacquainted) person in exchange for monetary compensation, which was criminalised in 1956 by the introduction of article 3 of the . However, the definition of prostitution made illegal under this law is strictly limited to sexual intercourse with an 'unspecified person', and does not criminalise the sale of numerous other acts performed by sex workers in exchange for compensation, such as oral sex, anal sex, mammary intercourse and other non-coital sex acts; the , also known as the "Law to Regulate Adult Entertainment Businesses", amended in 1985, 1999 and 2005, regulates these businesses, making only one definition of prostitution in Japan illegal.
Following the criminalisation of payment for sexual intercourse, the sex industry in Japan has developed into a number of varied businesses and offering services not prohibited under Japanese law. These fall into a number of categories known by various euphemistic names, such as soaplands, fashion health shops, and pink salons, with the term "health" commonly being a euphemism for sexual services. These businesses typically operate out of physical premises, either with their own employees or freelancers such as call girls, who may operate via Internet dating sites known as "sites" (Internet dating sites) or via delivery health services.
Delivery health.
, also known as or by the abbreviation , is a category of sex work in Japan that offers a "call girl" or escort service, dispatching sex workers to their customers' homes or to hotels. Delivery health businesses do not typically operate out of physical premises, instead employing freelancers, and advertise through handouts sent to mailboxes, posters in telephone booths, public toilets and similar places, usually in large cities within Japan; advertising is also conducted through a number of websites online.
Fashion health.
, or "health" for short, is a form of massage parlor which circumvents Japanese laws by offering a range of services that stop short of sexual intercourse. Fashion health clubs are typically found in most of Japan's larger cities, operating out of physical premises decorated with bright flashing lights and generally bright and garish decor. Often advertised euphemistically as "health clubs", fashion health clubs are known for occasionally confusing foreigners unfamiliar with fashion health businesses. Fashion health clubs commonly post pictures of their "masseuse" employees near the entrance, though the face and eyes may be censored with pixellation or black strips; some club entrances feature caricatured depictions of the services provided.
Image club.
An , or , is a type of brothel in Japan similar to fashion health parlors, differing in that image clubs are typically themed in the style of common or popular sexual fantasies, such as an office, a doctor's surgery, a classroom, or a train carriage. Sex workers employed at image clubs, whose activities are usually limited to oral sex, wear exaggerated costumes appropriate to the setting and the desire of the customer. Image clubs simulating molestation of female train passengers became popular in the wake of stricter enforcement of laws against groping on trains.
Image clubs may offer itemized pricing for particular services, such as taking instant photographs, removing a woman's underwear or taking it home. Women working at image clubs are paid around 30,000 to 35,000 yen per day, and may make more than 1 million yen per month.
Pink salon.
A ', or ' for short, is a type of brothel in Japan which specialises in oral sex. Pink salons avoid criminalisation under Japanese law by serving food, operating without showers or private rooms, and limiting the services provided to fellatio. Pink salons may also offer additional activities such as fingering a customer's "companion", and (intercrural sex). Pink salons are found across Japan, and workers commonly see a dozen or more customers per shift.
Soapland.
, or , which first developed following the criminalisation of compensated sexual intercourse with unacquainted persons in the late 1950s, began as a simple bathhouse service where women washed men's bodies. Originally referred to as , meaning "Turkish bath", the businesses were renamed following a 1984 campaign by Turkish scholar , with the name "soapland" chosen as the winning entry in a nationwide contest. The term is a "Japanlish" term, constructed from the two English words "soap" and "land".
Soaplands exploit a legal loophole in Japanese law, wherein compensated sexual intercourse may be conducted between 'specified' (acquainted) persons. In his book ("Control of Sex Business Operations"), Kansai University professor documented the practice of soapland businesses, wherein customers pay an entry fee to 'use the bathing facilities', and a separate fee for a massage. Whilst the massage takes place, the masseuse and the customer become 'acquainted', resulting in any paid sexual services following this as not being viewed as prostitution as defined by the law, an interpretation that has been utilised since the 1960s. However, some soaplands have, in previous decades, been prosecuted for violating the Anti-Prostitution Law, having been deemed to be places of prostitution, resulting in the cessation of these businesses.
A number of different types of soapland exist, typically located in complexes with varying numbers of soaplands. Well known complexes can be found in in , and in Tokyo, , in , in , in , in , and in . A number of other areas, especially in ("hot springs") towns, also feature soaplands. Although the main clientele for soaplands are men, there are also a few soaplands specifically for female clients. Prices for a session at a soapland vary depending on location, time of day, rank of provider, and length of the session.
 or intercrural sex in English translation is the Japanese term for a non-penetrative sex act popular in Japanese brothels. It is a form of frottage performed by a female sex worker upon a male client. The sex worker rubs the client's penis with her thighs (intercrural sex) and labia majora. The goal is to stimulate ejaculation without penile vaginal penetration, an activity circumventing the Anti-Prostitution Law.

Joy Buolamwini

Joy Adowaa Buolamwini is a Ghanaian-American computer scientist and digital activist based at the MIT Media Lab. She founded the Algorithmic Justice League, an organization that looks to challenge bias in decision making software. The organization does this by blending art and research to highlight the social implications and harms of AI.
Early life and education.
Buolamwini was born in Edmonton, Alberta, grew up in Mississippi and attended Cordova High School. At age 9, she was inspired by Kismet, the MIT robot, and taught herself XHTML, JavaScript and PHP. She was a competitive pole vaulter.
As an undergraduate, Buolamwini studied computer science at Georgia Institute of Technology, where she researched health informatics. Buolamwini graduated as a Stamps President's Scholar from Georgia Tech in 2012, and was the youngest finalist of the Georgia Tech InVenture Prize in 2009.
Buolamwini is a Rhodes Scholar, a Fulbright fellow, a Stamps scholar, an Astronaut Scholar and an Anita Borg Institute scholar. As a Rhodes Scholar, she studied learning and technology at Jesus College, Oxford. During her scholarship she took part in the first formal Service Year, working on community focused projects. She was awarded a Master's Degree from MIT in 2017 for research supervised by Ethan Zuckerman.
Career and research.
In 2011, she teamed with the Trachoma program at Carter Center, to develop an Android-based assessment system for Ethiopia and aid eradication of the disease worldwide. As a Fulbright fellow, in 2013 Buolamwini worked with local computer scientists in Zambia to empower Zambian youth to become technology creators. On September 14, 2016 Buolamwini appeared at the White House summit on Computer Science for All.
She is a researcher at the MIT Media Lab, where she identifies bias in algorithms and develops practices for accountability during their design; at the lab, Buolamwini is a member of Ethan Zuckerman's Center for Civic Media group. During her research, Buolamwini showed facial recognition systems 1,000 faces and asked them to identify whether faces were female or male, she found that software found it hard to identify dark-skinned women. Her project, "Gender Shades", has attracted significant media attention and become part of her MIT thesis. Her 2018 paper "Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification", prompted responses from IBM and Microsoft, who swiftly improved their software. She also created the Aspire Mirror, a device that lets you see a reflection of yourself based on what inspires you. Her program, Algorithmic Justice League, aims to highlight the bias in code that can lead to discrimination against underrepresented groups. She has created two films, 'Code4Rights' and 'Algorithmic Justice League: Unmasking Bias'. She is Chief Technology Officer for Techturized Inc, a haircare technology company.
Buolamwini's research is cited as an influence for Google, Microsoft in addressing gender and race bias in their products and processes.
Activism.
Joy Buolamwini founded the Algorithmic Justice League (AJL) in 2016 to lead the charge in acquiring equitable and accountable artificial intelligence (AI). The AJL organization combines art and research to illuminate the societal implications and harms of AI. The company's mission is to raise public awareness about the impacts of AI, equip society with research, give a voice to the most vulnerable communities, and galvanize the tech industry and congress.
The AJL website operates as a place to locate information and as a live blog. There are several sections on the site where people can share their stories and take action to donate or write to congressional representatives.
Voicing Erasure.
Voicing Erasure is one of the newer sections of research featured on the AJL website. Joy Buolamwini, Allison Koenecke, Safiya Noble, Ruha Benjamin, Kimberle Crenshaw, Megan Smith, and Sasha Costanza-Chock produced a spoken word about bias in voice systems. Buolamwini and Koenecke are the lead researchers uncovering the biases of voice systems. They've discovered that speech recognition systems have the most trouble with African American Vernacular English speakers, despite the disturbing fact that these systems are secretly listening to our conversations. The final issue addressed is the harmful gender stereotypes perpetuated by the subservient nature of Siri, Alexa, and Cortona.
The Coded Gaze: Unmasking Algorithmic Bias.
The Coded Gaze is a mini documentary debuted at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston in 2016 and currently available via YouTube. Buolamwini uses the mini documentary to concentrate on the bias which lies in Artificial Intelligence's function. The inspiration for the mini documentary and her research came when she was at MIT, creating her art "Aspire Mirror" which uses facial recognition to reflect another person who inspires you, onto your face. Buolamwini anticipated having Serena Williams, another dark-skinned woman, reflected onto her face. However, the technology did not recognize her face. Buolamwini's research investigates why this was occurring, and consequently led Buolamwini to conclude that the exclusion of people who look like her was a result of a term she dubbed, the "Coded Gaze." She further discusses this concept in the mini documentary, "The Coded Gaze." The documentary explores how AI is subject to racial and gender biases that reflect the views and cultural backgrounds of those who develop it.
Coded Bias.
The "Coded Bias" is a documentary film directed by Shalini Kantayya that features Joy Buolamwini’s research about AI inaccuracies in facial recognition technology and automated assessment software. It focuses on the lack of regulation of facial recognition tools sold by IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon that perpetuate racial and gender bias. The film tells the story about a battle between Brooklyn tenants and a building management company that tried to initiate facial recognition to enter the building. The film featured include Weapons of Math Destruction author Cathy O'Neill and members of Big Brother Watch, including Silkie Carlo, which is located in London. On April 5, 2021, the documentary was made available to stream on Netflix.
Awards and recognition.
In 2017, Buolamwini was awarded the grand prize in the professional category in the "Search for Hidden Figures" contest, tied to the release of the film "Hidden Figures" in December 2016. The contest, sponsored by PepsiCo and 21st Century Fox, was intended to "help uncover the next generation of female leaders in science, technology, engineering and math," and attracted 7,300 submissions from young women across the United States.
Buolamwini delivered a TEDx talk at Beacon Street entitled "How I'm fighting bias in algorithms". In 2018 she appeared on TED Radio Hour. She was featured on Amy Poehler's Smart Girls in 2018. "Fast Company" magazine listed her as one of four "design heroes who are defending democracy online". She was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women in 2018.
In 2019, Buolamwini was listed in Fortune Magazine's 2019 list of the World's Greatest Leaders. The magazine also termed her "the conscience of the A.I. revolution". She also made the inaugural Time 100 Next list in 2019. In 2020, Joy Buolamwini featured in a Levi's woman empowerment campaign for 8 March International Women's Day. She was also featured in the documentary Coded Bias.
Personal life.
Buolamwini has lived in Ghana; Barcelona, Spain; Oxford, United Kingdom; and in the U.S., Memphis, Tennessee and Atlanta, Georgia.

Władysław Wszebór Kulski (27 July 1903 – 16 May 1989) was a Polish political scientist.
Kulski was born in Warsaw, Poland. He was educated at the Warsaw School of Law, where he gained a Master of Laws in 1925. In 1927 he was awarded a "Doctor Juris" from the Paris School of Law. From 1928 until 1945 he was part of the Polish Foreign Service and from 1928 until 1933 he was a member of the League of Nations staff in the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 1933 until 1936 Kulski was a Counsellor and then Secretary of the Polish Permanent Delegation to the League and then (until 1940) he was head of the Legal Service at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1939 Kulski was sent to London to negotiate the Anglo-Polish military alliance. Afterwards, he was editor of the Polish White Book, a collection of diplomatic documents about the origin of the Second World War. He subsequently became Minister Plenipotentiary at the UK's Polish Embassy from 1940 until 1945.

Presidential Memorandum on Military Service by Transgender Individuals (2018)

The Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security Regarding Military Service by Transgender Individuals is the 43rd presidential memorandum signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on March 23, 2018.
The memorandum:
On 13 April 2018 the policy was stayed when a federal district court ruled that the 2018 memorandum essentially repeated the same issues as its predecessor order from 2017, that transgender service members (and transgender individuals as a class) were a protected class entitled to strict scrutiny of adverse laws (or at worst, a quasi-suspect class), and ordered that matter continue to a full trial hearing on the legality of the proposed policy.
On January 25, 2021, Trump's successor Joe Biden signed an executive order revoking this memorandum.
Enactment.
On March 23, 2018, Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, told the "Washington Blade" that the “DOD will still comply with federal court rulings and continue to assess and retain transgender service members,”. On March 24, 2018, Eastburn said that given ongoing lawsuits and court rulings on the issue that there is "likely be no immediate impact on transgender service." The Memorandum for Sector Commanders, Battalion Commanders, MEPS Commanders, Directors, and Special Staff Officers, issued December 8, 2017, enacted a policy guidance to recruits to explain how to enlist transgender individuals and states that the memorandum “shall remain in effect until expressly revoked.” On April 18, 2018, Commandant Paul F. Zukunft told the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security that the United States Coast Guard would continue to allow transgender members to serve unless specific legislation is passed banning them. On February 6, 2019, Maj. Gen. Matthew Beevers, the assistant adjutant general for the California National Guard, told the California Assembly Veterans Affairs Committee that the California National Guard would not remove transgender soldiers and airmen from its ranks.
Lawsuits.
There are four lawsuits involving the policy:
On April 13, 2018, the policy was stayed in "Karnoski vs. Trump" (Western District of Washington), when the court ruled that the 2018 memorandum essentially repeated the same issues as its predecessor order from 2017, that transgender service members (and transgender individuals as a class) were a protected class entitled to strict scrutiny of adverse laws (or at worst, a quasi-suspect class), and ordered that matter continue to a full trial hearing on the legality of the proposed policy. The government has petitioned the US Supreme Court in November 2018 to reverse the stay while the cases are pending. The Court, in a 5–4 order along ideological lines issued in January 2019, agreed to lift the stay while they continued to deliberate on the merits of the cases.
Repeal.
On January 25, 2021, President Joe Biden held a meeting with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and afterwards signed an executive order which lifted the transgender military ban.

Cerumenolytic

A cerumenolytic is an ear wax (cerumen) softening agent. Common cerumenolytics such as hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen peroxide - urea are topical preparations used to facilitate the removal of ear wax. Their side effects tend to be mild, including ear discomfort, transient loss of hearing, dizziness, and local irritation.
Medical uses.
Cerumenolytics are used to soften and break up ear wax. Using a cerumenolytic can reduce the need for flushing the ear with irrigants for wax removal. Additionally, cerumenolytics can also facilitate the manual removal of ear wax. Overall, all cerumenolytics are considered to be equivalent in efficacy. Cerumenolytics are administered directly into the ear, which is a form of topical administration that can be specified as "ototopical." Generally, the use of a cerumenolytic involves instilling several drops of the product into the affected ear once or twice daily for a treatment duration of 3 to 5 days. Each instillation is relatively quick (less than 5 minutes) and can be done either at home or in a clinical setting. However, like all ear wax treatments, the ear wax can reaccumulate in the ear after treatment, necessitating further treatment. Cerumenolytics are not recommended in children less than 3 years-old.
Available forms and classification.
Cerumenolytics are available as topical preparations intended for installation into the ear. Cerumenolytics can be classified based upon the formulation of their constituents: water based, oil based, or neither. 
Contraindications.
Cerumenolytics should not be used in ears that in which the ear drum has been perforated or is otherwise nonintact. Cerumenolytics should also be avoided in ears that are actively infected due to the lack of research in this area (i.e. people suffering from otitis externa, a type of ear infection).
Adverse effects.
In general, cerumenolytics can cause ear discomfort, transient loss of hearing, dizziness, and local irritation. Local reactions are least frequent with cerumenolytics that lack organic chemicals, such as a saline.
Overdose.
Using the cerumenolytic hydrogen peroxide as an example, no adverse effects are expected with overdose of an otic administered preparation. The average middle ear volume is 0.4 mL, which limits otic accumulation in overdose. It is unlikely that an cerumenolytic administered into the ear would cause systemic toxicity in an overdose situation, due to the lack of systemic absorption resulting from minimal volume flow within the inner ear. However, again using hydrogen peroxide as an example, clinically relevant overdoses of cerumenolytics are possible if the drugs are administered by other routes (e.g. by mouth).
Pharmacology.
The mechanism of action of cerumenolytics vary by the classification. Water-based cerumenolytics, including water itself, work by hydrating ear wax, fragmenting corneocytes (a type of skin cell) within the ear wax itself. Cerumenolytics with peroxides release oxygen upon contact with the skin, inducing effervescence (bubbling) that mechanically fragments ear wax. Oil-based cerumenolytics provide lubrication to the ear wax, softening the surface without fragmenting the ear wax. The mechanism of action of non-water- and non-oil-based cerumenolytics is unknown. Using carbamide peroxide as an example, the pharmacokinetics of cerumenolytics are not well studied.
Veterinary use.
Cerumenolytics are used to treat cerumen impaction in cats and dogs. The removal of cerumen is also an important step in the treatment of otitis in small animals. Veterinary cerumenolytics possess different potencies. Diocytl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate, and urea or carbamide peroxide are considered to be potent veterinary cerumenolytics.

Greg Wrubell

Greg Wrubell is a sports broadcaster based out of Cedar Hills, Utah. He is a commentator for college sports, including football, men's basketball, and women's soccer for Brigham Young University's (BYU) Sports Network and was the television voice for Utah Royals FC matches on KMYU their first season. He is also the Director of Broadcast Media at BYU.
Early life.
Wrubell was born and raised in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, where he developed an early love for hockey. He excelled at education and was allowed to skip first grade. He attended high school at Lord Beaverbrook High School. Despite his love of sports, Wrubell found he was not a very good player. Instead he attended choir, drama, and public speaking competitions.
Wrubell's father, Allan, sparked his interest in sports. Allan was the local public address announcer for the Saskatoon Blades. As a result Greg decided to pursue sports broadcasting in college. Greg applied to many schools and eventually chose BYU. Greg attended BYU and was quickly swept up in the school's national championship run. His first exposure to football occurred on his first day of school in 1984, when he watched BYU play at Pitt in BYU's Cougar Stadium. After seeing that action Greg knew he had found his calling and applied for a job at KBYU. They sent him to work covering the fencing team.
Broadcasting career.
After serving two years as a missionary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Brazil, Wrubell returned to BYU in 1987 and met his future wife, Tauna Fehrner, and began an internship at KSL. At the end of the summer, the two married and Wrubell parlayed his internship into weekend work where he became co-host of the KSL weekend sports talk show with Chris Tunis. Wrubell would remain at BYU until 1990 when he graduated with a degree in communications.
In 1992, Paul James invited Wrubell to join the BYU Cougars football radio team. Wrubell served as the sideline reporter for football and men's basketball. A heart attack led to James missing a few basketball games during the 1996-97 season, allowing Wrubell to move from the sidelines to play-by-play. Wrubell would become the full-time play-by-play voice for men's basketball during the 1997-98 season and then for football in 2001.
Wrubell gained nationwide exposure when he made the only national radio commentary of the 2014 Miami Beach Bowl, including the infamous brawl between BYU and Memphis. He followed that up by being featured nationally on ESPN's SportsCenter and IMG College's best of the week during weeks one and two of the 2015 BYU Cougars football season, following Tanner Mangum's hail-mary victories over Nebraska and Boise State.
In 2016, Wrubell left KSL where he had been a producer, reporter, host, and announcer and became the BYU Director of Broadcast Media. In 2018, Wrubell was hired as the first television broadcaster for Utah Royals FC.
Personal life.
Greg and Tauna Wrubell live in Cedar Hills, Utah and are the parents of four children. One of their children, Regan, has autism, so Wrubell has participated in many autism-related benefit events. Wrubell testified before the Utah Legislature for autism funding and solicited corporate sponsors to donate to autism-related causes. He has also acted as emcee for benefit auctions for those with autism and at a few BYU award shows.

Newcastle Town Hall

The Town Hall was a local government building located in St Nicholas Square, Newcastle upon Tyne.
History.
Until the mid-19th century civic leaders had held their meetings in the Guildhall. The town hall had its origins in the Corn Exchange which was designed by John and Benjamin Green and built in stone in St Nicholas Square (between the Bigg Market and the Cloth Market) by a private company in 1839. 
The foundation stone for the new town hall was laid by the mayor, Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell, in 1855. The design, which was undertaken by John Johnstone in the Italian neoclassical style, involved incorporating the Corn Exchange into the central section of the building as an assembly hall capable of accommodating 3,000 people: a large concert organ was acquired at that time. The design also involved a council chamber and municipal offices for Newcastle Town Council. The main frontage of the new building, facing the cathedral, had four Corinthian order columns on the ground floor and also on the first floor while the rear elevation, facing onto the Bigg Market, had a tower with a cupola. The works, which cost some £50,000, were completed in 1863. 
The first organised dog show in the UK was held in the assembly hall in the building in 1859. The town council, which became a city council in 1882, failed to maintain the building properly and the tower had to be demolished in the 1930s.
By the middle of the 20th century condition of the town hall had deteriorated to such an extent that the council was forced to relocate to modern facilities at Newcastle Civic Centre in Barras Bridge in 1968. A "winter zoo" involving lions, tigers, monkeys, exotic birds and snakes continued to be held in the building in the late 1960s but, ultimately, the town hall had to be demolished in 1973. The site was subsequently redeveloped to create a complex of modern office buildings known as No. 1 Cathedral Square (the southern section) and Stanegate House (the northern section).

Chellapilla Venkata Rao

Chellapilla Venkata Rao (1910–1971) was an Indian botanist.
Education.
He was awarded his PhD from the University of Tasmania in 1957 with a thesis entitled "Cytotaxonomic studies in the Proteaceae".
Academic appointments.
He worked in the Department of Botany, Andhra University, Waltair, from 1948 to 1967. During this period he worked for three years on the Palmaceae as a senior post-doctoral fellow of the National Institute of Science of India. From 1955 to 1957, under the Colombo plan as a post-doctoral research scholar working with H.N. Barber at the University of Tasmania, he received a PhD (in addition to his earlier D.Sc. from Andhra University – for work on Malvaceae). From 1967 until his death in 1971, he was head of the department of botany, Andhra University Postgraduate Centre, Guntur, India, where he both taught and wrote.
Research interests.
A major interest was the family Proteaceae, and in 1971, CSIR published his monograph on the family. The monograph was said by J.P.Rourke of the Compton Herbarium, himself a specialist in Proteaceae, to be
a broad survey of the whole family on the basis of the anatomy and morphology of the leaves, stems, inflorescences, flowers, and fruits of representative species from most of the living genera. Embryological features are treated in detail and accounts of the cytology and fossil records are also provided...As the leading researcher on this family, Venkata Rao has, not unnaturally, drawn heavily on his own work but has nevertheless succeeded in dealing with the literature as a whole in a comprehensive manner.
A second reviewer, Ronald Melville (of Kew Gardens), disagreed with Rao's phylogenetic and evolutionary conclusions but thought that many would be grateful to Venkata Rao "for bringing together in one volume such a detailed, comparative account of the vegetative and floral morphology and anatomy, the cytology and embryology, which will make it a valuable work of reference for a long time to come."
Within the Proteaceae, he authored the tribes, Macadamieae and Lambertieae (basionym of Lambertiinae) (both now subsumed into the Grevilleoideae).
He also worked on other families, in particular, the Sterculiaceae, Malvaceae and Bombacaceae (now subsumed in an enlarged Malvaceae), and also Euphorbiaceae, Elaeocarpaceae and Apocynaceae.
His work centred on plant anatomy, morphology and embryology and also involved other families.

Garry Tonon

Garry Lee Tonon (born September 12, 1991) is an American submission grappler and mixed martial artist. He is a five-time Eddie Bravo Invitational champion, and has won titles at ADCC submission wrestling championship, IBJJF World and Pan American championships.
He is known for his use of leglocks in submission-only grappling matches, and is considered to be part of the "Danaher Death Squad," a group of several young professional grapplers that train under John Danaher (martial artist) at Renzo Gracie Academy. They are recognized for their intense training schedule, as well as the utilization of Danaher's leg, back, and arm attack systems to consistently win grappling matches via submission, as opposed to points.
While he still maintains a consistent submission grappling training schedule, since his debut in early 2018 Tonon has focused primarily on training and competing in professional mixed martial arts competition. He is an active fighter for the Singapore-based mixed martial arts promotion ONE Championship. He officially signed with the organization in October 2017. Tonon is currently ranked No. 3 in the ONE Championship Featherweight rankings.
Tonon has background in folkstyle wrestling, and is also a black belt in BJJ under Tom DeBlass &amp; Ricardo Almeida, and is the head instructor of Brunswick BJJ in South Brunswick, New Jersey. He has also trained extensively with grappling and mixed martial arts coach John Danaher at Renzo Gracie Academy in Manhattan.

As a child, Tonon was identified as having ADHD by his mother, an employee of a non-profit organization for children with special needs. Tonon had his first introduction to grappling when he joined the wrestling team at his school in 5th grade. Tonon continued to wrestle for several more years, through his freshman year of high school. Tonon has credited wrestling &amp; martial arts with helping him to cope with his ADHD, and partially attributes his particular style of grappling to the disorder. He attended Lacey Township High School in Lacey Township, New Jersey, where he later graduated in 2009.
At age 14, a friend decided to bring Tonon to a local jiu-jitsu tournament, which interested Tonon. He soon began taking classes at his friend's jiu-jitsu academy, but lost interest after several months due to the school's focus on mixed martial arts, as opposed to jiu-jitsu. Shortly after leaving that school, Tonon found an advertisement for Tom DeBlass' academy, Ocean County Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and decided to continue his training there. While still attending high school, Tonon would consistently attend two classes per day at DeBlass' academy. DeBlass, noticing Tonon's interest in the sport, began bringing Tonon to Ricardo Almeida's academy for additional training.
Grappling career.
In 2008, after about a year of consistent jiu-jitsu training with DeBlass and Almeida, Tonon won his first title at the IBJJF World Championships in the Blue Belt Juvenile Division. After graduating high school in 2009, Tonon began pursuing a degree in exercise science at Rutgers University. While studying at Rutgers, Tonon maintained a rigorous training schedule and continued to compete in both local and international competitions, mostly competing in the gi for the first 5 years of his training, but later beginning to seek out more specialized, no-gi instruction from John Danaher. He was awarded his black belt by Tom DeBlass and Ricardo Almeida in September 2013. One month later, Tonon went on to compete for the first time in the ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship in Beijing, China, where he had matches with Kron Gracie, Marcus Almeida, Roberto "Cyborg" Abreu, and other well-known jiu-jitsu competitors.
From 2013 to 2017, Tonon went on to compete in numerous jiu-jitsu competitions as a black belt, including the IBJJF World &amp; Pan American Championships, Eddie Bravo Invitational, Metamoris, Grapplers Quest, North American Grappling Association (NAGA), Kasai Grappling, Polaris Pro Grappling, ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship, and others. His most notable wins include matches against AJ Agazarm, Joao Miyao, Dillon Danis, Ralek Gracie, and Vinny Magalhaes.
Mixed martial arts career.

The bout was subsequently rescheduled for on December 4, 2020 and it was confirmed that he would have to compete without his coach, John Danaher, in his corner for the first time due to travel restrictions in place in Singapore. Tonon was unable to finish as Matsushima defended his submissions, but secured the unanimous decision victory to earn the first decision win of his mixed martial arts career.

Arnaud Beltrame

Arnaud Jean-Georges Beltrame (; 18 April 1973 – 24 March 2018) was a lieutenant colonel in the French Gendarmerie nationale and deputy commander of the Departmental Gendarmerie's Aude unit, who was murdered by a terrorist at Trèbes after having exchanged himself for a hostage. French President Emmanuel Macron said that Beltrame deserved "the respect and admiration of the whole nation." For his bravery and adherence to duty he was posthumously promoted to colonel and made a Commander of the Legion of Honour.
Early life and education.
Beltrame was born on 18 April 1973 in Étampes, France.
Beltrame was a double "Major de promotion" who graduated at the top of his class in 2001 from the French Army EMIA military academy (École militaire interarmes) and in 2002 from French Gendarmerie nationale Officers School (École des officiers de la gendarmerie nationale).
Military career.
After following a reserve officer cursus during his military service, Beltrame became a serving reserve artillery officer, assigned first to the 35th Airborne artillery regiment in Tarbes and then the 8th artillery regiment in Commercy. He then transferred to the Gendarmerie and was briefly assigned to the Mobile Gendarmerie armored unit in Satory, near Versailles, before being selected in 2003 for the elite gendarmerie parachute squadron (EPIGN), also based at Satory. He deployed to Iraq in 2005 and received military honors for his service there. He then joined the Republican Guard, part of the national gendarmerie that provides guards of honor and security for the State. He was stationed at the Élysée Palace between 2006 and 2010 and then took command of a Departmental Gendarmerie company in Avranches from 2010 to 2014. After staff service with the Ministry of Ecology and post-graduate training in Business administration and Economy, he joined the Carcassonne Departmental gendarmerie unit in southwestern France in August 2017 as deputy commander.
Trèbes terrorist attack.
At about 11 a.m. on 24 March 2018, Redouane Lakdim, a terrorist claiming allegiance to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) stormed a supermarket in Trèbes armed with a handgun, a hunting knife, and three homemade bombs. He shot two people dead and took others hostage. Police negotiated for release of the hostages, and Beltrame offered to take the place of the final one, a female cashier. Beltrame set his mobile phone on a table with its line open so that police outside could monitor activity inside. After a three-hour stand-off, Lakdim stabbed and shot Beltrame. In response, GIGN operatives stormed the supermarket at 2:40 PM and killed the assailant. An autopsy revealed that Beltrame had sustained four bullet wounds but died from stab wounds to the throat.
Personal life.
Beltrame was reared in a nonreligious family but, at age 33, he converted to Catholic Christianity, receiving the sacraments of First Communion and Confirmation in 2008 after spending two years as a catechumen. In 2015, he made a pilgrimage to Basilica of Sainte-Anne d'Auray, "where he asked the Virgin Mary to help him to meet the woman of his life" and shortly afterwards, "he became friends with Marielle, whose faith is deep and discreet." He had married his partner in a civil ceremony in August 2016, but they had planned a church wedding in June 2018 at the Basilica of Saints Nazarius and Celsus. Prior to the terrorist attack at Trèbes, Beltrame made a pilgrimage to Compostela. Beltrame had also been a Freemason and received public honors from his Grand Lodge, but he had distanced himself from the fraternal order during his last years He had an interest in the history of France and its Christian roots. A week before his death, Beltrame buried his father, who had drowned in the Mediterranean in August 2017 and whose body had been recently recovered in the nets of a fishing boat.
Homages.
Minister of the Interior Gérard Collomb, and then French President Emmanuel Macron, spoke of Beltrame's bravery and heroism.
A national tribute was paid to Beltrame at Les Invalides on 27 March 2018 with Macron presiding. French flags and the banners of the Gendarmerie and the National Assembly were lowered to half-staff and many cities announced that streets, squares or buildings would be named in the colonel's honour.

D. James Kennedy Ministries

D. James Kennedy Ministries (DJKM), formerly “Coral Ridge Ministries,” is an evangelical Christian media outreach founded by minister and evangelist D. James Kennedy in 1974. The group is listed as an anti-LGBT hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center due to statements and positions which the SPLC describes as falsely demeaning gay and lesbian people.
Best known in the 1980s and 1990s for its flagship one-hour television program, "The Coral Ridge Hour", which claimed an audience of three million nationwide, D. James Kennedy Ministries now broadcasts a weekly half-hour TV program "Truths That Transform". Hosted by ministry president, Frank Wright, "Truths That Transform" airs nationwide on four cable networks and seeks to give a “biblical perspective” on “moral and cultural controversies.” The program includes interviews, news segments, and video excerpts from sermons preached by D. James Kennedy (1930–2007), the former senior minister of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
DJKM airs sermons preached by Kennedy on its weekly half-hour program, "Kennedy Classics". "Truth in Action Radio" is an Internet-only program featuring weekly messages from Kennedy.
History.
DJKM began in 1974 as “Coral Ridge Ministries Media,” the media outreach of D. James Kennedy. The ministry was re-branded as “Truth in Action Ministries” in 2011.
At Kennedy’s direction, the ministry produced and broadcast "Who Is This Jesus?", a one-hour television special aired on CBS affiliates at Christmas 2001. The program, co-hosted by Kennedy with actor Dean Jones, reached a claimed 20 million viewers, with its Easter follow-up, "Who Is This Jesus: Is He Risen?" The program offered scholarly viewpoints on the reliability of the Gospels, especially the resurrection claim. Associated Press religion writer Richard Ostling contrasted the broadcast to the 2000 Peter Jennings-hosted ABC News documentary, "The Search for Jesus", contending the program “achieved more journalistic success than Jennings at one point” by providing a broader cross-section of experts.
Programs.
Center for Christian Statesmanship.
The ministry launched the Washington, D.C.-based D. James Kennedy Center for Christian Statesmanship (CCS) in 1995. A Capitol Hill outreach to lawmakers and congressional staff, the Center is a discipleship and evangelism outreach to train and equip “Christian statesman.” It awards a "Distinguished Christian Statesman Award" annually to high-profile Christian political leaders. Past award recipients include Mike Pence, Tom DeLay, Sam Brownback, John Ashcroft, and Mike Huckabee.
Center for Reclaiming America for Christ.
DJKM founded its social action branch, The Center for Reclaiming America for Christ, in 1996. With an emphasis on cultural engagement, the ministry also hosted Reclaiming America for Christ conferences in Fort Lauderdale to inspire Christians to become involved in politics and Christian social action. Speakers included former vice president Dan Quayle, then-Sen. John Ashcroft, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, Jerry Falwell, and Judge Roy Moore. DJKM closed the Center for Reclaiming America for Christ in April 2007.
Center for Christian Leadership.
In 2018, DJKM began the D. James Kennedy Center for Christian Leadership, as an initiative of its Center for Christian Statesmanship in Washington, D.C. The Center for Christian Leadership provides comprehensive leadership training to those preparing to seek elected office and to those seeking other areas of service in the public policy arena.
Leadership.
Wright, a Kennedy protégé, and ordained Elder in the Presbyterian Church in America, served on the DJKM Board of Directors prior to being named president and chief executive officer (CEO) in 2015. Wright, formerly president and chief operating officer (COO) of the Salem Media Group, also served as president and CEO of the National Religious Broadcasters for 10 years, and as the founding executive director of the Center for Christian Statesmanship, at its launch by DJKM in 1995.
Awards.
The National Religious Broadcasters association (NRB) named "The Coral Ridge Hour" “Television Program of the Year” in 2003 and gave its “Best Radio Teaching Program for 2004” to the ministry’s daily radio program, "Truths That Transform". NRB inducted Kennedy into its Hall of Fame in 2005.
Dismissed defamation lawsuit against the SPLC.
DJKM filed a defamation suit in federal court against the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) on Aug. 22, 2017 after the group listed the ministry as an “anti-LGBT hate group.” The SPLC has exposed and sued white-supremacist groups under the direction of its founder, Morris Dees, but began focusing on immigration control groups and opponents of gay rights and same-sex marriage in the 2000s. It claims that DJKM engages in “anti-LGBT organizing and ideology . . . [and] demonizes LGBT people as threats to children, society and often public health.”
The DJKM suit alleges the SPLC "illegally trafficked in false and misleading descriptions of the services offered by DJKM and committed defamation against DJKM arising from the publication and distribution of false information that libels the ministry's reputation and subjects the ministry to disgrace, ridicule, odium, and contempt in the estimation of the public," a ministry statement said.
On February 21, 2018, a federal magistrate judge recommended that the suit be dismissed with prejudice, concluding that D. James Kennedy Ministries could not show that it had been libeled.
On September 19, 2019, the lawsuit was dismissed by Judge Myron H. Thompson, who ruled that the "SPLC's labeling of the group as [a hate group] is protected by the First Amendment."
SPLC Response.
In response, SPLC president J. Richard Cohen, said the lawsuit is "meritless" and that the ministry’s Bible-based views are not immune from criticism. He added: "We have a First Amendment right to express our opinions, just as Coral Ridge has a right to express its opinions."

He served for 35 years in the United States Military and earned many awards in marksmanship. He is most known for his role in the 1985 bombing of MOVE, which he classified as a terrorist organization.
1985 MOVE bombing.
On May 13, 1985, nearly 500 police officers moved in to execute arrest warrants on MOVE's members. Police commissioner Sambor read a long speech to the members of the organization. When they didn't respond, police moved in to forcibly remove them from the premises, leading to an armed standoff. After the police used over ten thousand rounds of ammunition, Sambor ordered the compound be breached. Two breaching charges made from a FBI-supplied explosive were dropped on the roof of the building, which ignited the fuel of a gasoline-powered generator there. Ramona Africa, the only adult survivor, reported that police shot at anyone attempting to escape the fire. In the end, 11 MOVE members including 5 children were killed in the blaze and 250 civilians were left homeless.
Sambor resigned as police commissioner in November of that year of his own decision, although advised not to by family and friends. Believing he was being made a "surrogate" by Mayor W. Wilson Goode, he did not wish to remain in the environment.

Ghodazari Wildlife Sanctuary

Ghodazari Wildlife Sanctuary is a wildlife reserve established in 2018 in Nagbhir in the Chandrapur district of the Vidarbha region in Maharashtra, India. It includes of southern tropical dry forest and a lake. The forest is considered a key region on the connecting corridor for the tiger migration between the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Project and Umred Karhandala Wildlife Sanctuary. It is named after a village of the same name that is almost in the middle of the forest, about 2 km from the dam and the resort. In Marathi, "ghoda" means horse and "zari" means a place with a water spring. 
Sanctuary.
Tigers are the main attraction and the reason for the creation of the sanctuary. Census records show there are at least 12 tigers in the region, but because the sanctuary is on the tiger migration pathway, tigers from the Tadoba and Umred Karhandala sanctuaries have been seen and recorded in tiger research in this region. The sanctuary is also home to other wild mammals such as Indian leopards, sloth bears, gaur, dhole, nilgai, small Indian civet, jungle cats, sambar, barking deer, chital, and wild boar.
Ghodazari lake is an important destination for the native and migratory birds due to its undisturbed water body and abundance of food. Numerous reptiles have been recorded there, including the Indian python, common Indian monitor, Indian cobra and Russell's viper.
The Ghodazari Wildlife Sanctuary consists mainly of deciduous forest which has an extensive distribution of teak, palas, ain, bija, hald, salai, semal, tendu, beheda, hirda, karaya gum, mahua and Bamboo trees.
Human–wildlife conflict.
The Chandrapur area faces issues with human–wildlife conflict due to the presence of tigers near villages. In 2017, 21 tiger deaths were recorded in Maharashtra, the highest number recorded there in ten years. Some of these deaths may have been related to poaching, and some were due to tigers coming into contact with electric fences erected by farmers. A study by NGO Wildlife Protection Survey of India, there were 84 tiger deaths in Maharashtra from 2010 to 2017, and 25 of them were due to poaching. 
Humans are sometimes the victims of this conflict in this area as well. Between 2006 and 2010, up to 61 people in the Chandrapur district were killed by tigers.

Zuzana Vačková

Zuzana Vačková (born 12 February 1969) is a Slovak actress best known for her role in the television series "Panelák".
Life and career.
Early life.
Zuzana Vačková was born in Nitra, a historical town in Western Slovakia. Shortly after her birth, her family moved to Prievidza. They later moved once more, this time to Bratislava.
Acting and studies.
Vačková has stated that acting happened to her by accident. Instead of enrolling in a Slovak-language course, as was her plan, she ended up taking drama. Shortly after she started attending the course, it was visited by Štefan Uher, a well-known Slovak director, who was looking for a young actress to play a role in his new movie "Kosenie Jastrabej lúky" (1981). Vačková won the audition, and thus got her first acting role, in a film associated with the Czechoslovak New Wave. The performance opened many new opportunities for her, both in film and television. A few months later, she starred in her first television movie, "Pulzovanie nášho vesmíru", which aired in 1982. This movie also marks the first time she met her future husband, Rastislav Rogel.
While already active in films, Vačková also managed to finish secondary school, and was accepted to the Academy of Performing Arts in Bratislava (VŠMU) in 1987. During this time, she continued to perform, appearing in a number of films, including a Russian production. One of her most notable roles from this period was in the Czech-language film "Sedmé nebe" (1987), which dealt with many controversial topics such as abortion; corruption; nepotism; generational differences; and lack of intimacy, honesty, and love in familial and human relationships.
In addition to her work in film and television, Vačková also performed in theatre, and she began garnering attention from critics.
At the Academy, her classmates included Zuzana Mauréry, Dagmar Bruckmayerová, Silvia Vargová, and many other actors who went on to become household names.
Vačková graduated from the Academy in 1991, and married her classmate Rastislav Rogel the same year. A year later, she gave birth to her first child, Jakub. The couple parted after six years. During this time, Vačková began doing voice acting on the side, dubbing foreign films into Slovak, and she also took other jobs, such as working in a flower shop and waitressing.
Between 2009 and 2014, she had a regular role in the television series "Panelák".
In 2016, she participated in the reality television show "Tvoja tvár znie povedome" (based on "Your Face Sounds Familiar"), where she won one episode with "The Shoop Shoop Song" by Cher.
Other activities.
Vačková is a member of various charity groups, such as Parasport 24, which supports handicapped athletes in Slovakia. She is also on the board of directors of the Linaje Foundation, which supports autistic and abused women. Members of this foundation have released a book titled "Rozprávky z Ôsmeho svetadielu" in order to raise funds for a residential facility for children and adults on the autism spectrum, in Borová.
Vačková teaches acting at the Conservatory in Bratislava.
In 2017, she co-wrote the book "Po anglicky so Zuzkou Vačkovou" ("In English with Zuzka Vačková") with actress Karin Haydu.

Mariajuana Smoking in Panama

 Smoking in Panama is the title of a 1933 report created by United States Army Medical Corps Colonel Joseph Franklin Siler (J.F. Siler) for the Commanding General of the Army's Panama Canal Department concerning cannabis (marijuana) use by U.S. military members. Use at that time in the Panama Canal Zone, then a U.S. territory, was a concern for military discipline and health.
The report has been called "one of the earliest semi-experimental studies" of cannabis. The report on Siler's research, going back to 1925, found that cannabis was "not habit forming in the same way as opiates and cocaine" and military delinquencies due to its use were "negligible in number" compared to alcohol.
Citations.
By other reports and research.
The 1933 report has been cited by other reports and research including the Surgeon General's 1988 "Health Consequences of Smoking: Nicotine Addiction", the Department of Health, Education and Welfare's 1972 report to Congress, "Licit and Illicit Drugs" by Consumers Union (1972), medical studies on human appetite, and others.
By legal defenses.
In 1964, Lowell Eggemeier's legal defense cited the 1933 government report, in the nation's first protest against what was called irrational drug control policy.

Villa Di Negro Rosazza dello Scoglietto

Villa Di Negro Rosazza "dello Scoglietto" or "lo Scoglietto" is a villa located in the quarter of San Teodoro in Genoa, Northwestern Italy. It was built in 1565 for the Doge Ambrogio Di Negro o for his son Orazio, in a coastal area that used to be outside of the city walls. The villa passed to the Durazzo family, who commissioned a renovation in the neoclassical style at the end of the 18th century. In the 19th century, the construction of the railway Turin-Genoa led to the destruction of the garden at the sea side, while the hill side remained largely untouched. The villa and the park are now owned by the Municipality of Genoa and destined to public use. The villa is located near the Dinegro station of the Metro of Genoa.
History.
The villa was commissioned in the 16th century by Doge Ambrogio Di Negro or his son Orazio in an area known as "Fassolo" - at the time outside of the city walls - where the Di Negro family owned a villa already since the beginning of the 15th century. Passed first to the Maniero family, then to the Durazzo family, the villa was completely remodeled in 1787 by the genoese architect Emanuele Andrea Tagliafichi for Gian Luca Durazzo, when it received the current neoclassical appearance.
In the 19th century the villa hosted famous guests, including Caroline of Brunswick, wife of George IV of the United Kingdom (1815), Pope Pius VII (1836), Honoré de Balzac and Lorenzo Pareto. Passed to the Rolla Rosazza family, it was later acquired by the Municipality of Genoa.
The original setting has radically changed as a result of the urbanization of the area and, in particular, of the construction of the Turin-Genoa railway in the 19th century, which led to the loss of the garden at the sea side. The garden at the hill side was renovated in 2015 and is now a public park.
Description.
Architecture.
The original appearance of the 16th-century villa, testified by an 18th-century engraving, featured a facade with loggias, architectural structures and large statues attributed to Giovanni Andrea Ansaldo. After the 18th century remodeling, the facade presents neoclassical structures with sculptures by Nicolò Stefano Traverso. Internally, the irregular layout shows an atypical distribution of the spaces.
Decoration.
The internal decoration preserves original 16th century elements, such as the portals, the frescoes in the piano nobile showing the achievements of Doge Ambrogio Di Negro against the Corsicans, and the grotesque paintings in the other rooms. Some 18th century elements are also visible, such as stucco decorations.
Garden.
The park of the villa, designed by the architect Tagliafichi in the 18th century, extended from the sea to the hill. While the front part is now lost, a monumental nymphaeum remains at the level of the main building, as well as the part at the back of the villa. The original distribution is documented by Martin-Pierre Gauthier.

Accra Technical University

The Accra Technical University was established in 1949 as a Technical School in Ghana and commissioned in 1957 as Accra Technical Institute and converted into a Technical University by the Parliament of Ghana in 2013.
History.
Establishment.
Accra Technical University was the first Technical University to be established. It was established in 1949 as a Technical School and commissioned in 1957 as Accra Technical Institute. In 1963, the Institute was renamed Accra Polytechnic, by the orders of the then President, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah. By the Polytechnic Law of 1992 (PNDC 321), which became fully operative in the 1993/1994 academic year, Accra Technical University was elevated to a tertiary status. The institution was then placed under the Higher Education Council with autonomy to award Higher National Diplomas (through the National Board for Professional and Technician Examinations [NABPTEX]).
With the passage of the PNDC Law 321, the University upgraded its programmes and facilities in it to provide middle-level manpower to revolutionise and feed the growing Ghanaian industries. Notwithstanding the difficulties that characterized the sudden change over from secondary to a tertiary status, Accra Technical University made a tremendous progress in its review and expansion of curricula to suit contemporary needs. Accra Technical University began to offer Higher National Diploma (HND) programmes in Mechanical Engineering, Electrical/Electronic Engineering, Building Technology, Civil Engineering, Furniture Design and Production, Secretaryship and Management Studies, Bilingual Secretaryship and Management Studies, Accountancy, Marketing, Purchasing and Supply, Hotel Catering and Institutional Management, Fashion Design and Textiles, Mathematics and Statistics, and Science Laboratory Technology. The technician courses offered by the Polytechnic were maintained.
University status.
In 2007 the Polytechnic Act (Act 745) was promulgated and it repealed PNDC Law 321 of 1992. This Act has granted the Polytechnics autonomy to award the Higher National Diplomas (HND), Diplomas and other Certificates accredited by the National Accreditation Board (NAB), and award Degrees subject to the conditions that the council of that Polytechnic may determine. Accra Technical University currently, offers ten (10) Degree (Btec) and fifteen (15) HND Programmes. These programmes are run in three schools. As a tertiary institution, Accra Technical University is governed by a Council established under the Technical University Act
2016 (Act 745).
Campus.
The campus is located at Barnes road, Accra
Academics.
The university has five faculties.
HND Programmes.
With the upgrade in status, the technician courses previously offered by the school were maintained, and Higher National Diploma (HND) programmes in the following fields were added:

Paul Harel

Paul Harel, born in Échauffour on May 18, 1854 and died on March 7, 1927, was a French poet and innkeeper.
Biography.
Early life.
Son of a Saint-Lô lawyer, Paul Harel often skipped school and was apprenticed to the pharmacist of Montreuil-l'Argillé at the age of fourteen, where he sold ointments while learning a little Latin from the local priest. From sixteen to nineteen, he was a typographer in Nogent-le-Rotrou, where he prints the works of Paulin Paris, Gaston Paris and Paul Meyer
Théophile Féret said of him: "Since the rhymes of brooch and sword, everyone knows the innkeeper of Échauffour, and since the Memories of inn, he has annexed his great hall to literature Norman. Before Barres, he identified some of the intimate connections between lineage, soil and ancestral worship. He wanted to root us in the homeland. "
In the preface to his first collection, Under the Apple Trees, published in 1879, Paul Harel took care to explain why he embraced the profession of hotelier: "My father was a lawyer, my grandfather innkeeper; I took up the job of this one for the sake of the picturesque. I thought I ought to give this bad example to my contemporaries, at a time when the sons of the earth are deserting their homes, where the life of the ancestors is unknown, if not scorned. If he has not regretted his choice, it is also a little because for him, "the great secret of everything is in charity", and that the ancestral profession allows him to practice this virtue on a large scale by welcoming to his home the poor, the beggars who pass on the road.
Later life.
Paul Harel was loved in return. He enjoyed a good reputation in his country. "In the Orne," says Féret, "one bears a religious tenderness to him. "
Paul Harel has sung the charms of nature and rural life with a sincerity and simplicity that exclude neither the picturesque nor the grandeur. In his last volume, which he prefers to others, The Far Hours (1903), he draws his inspiration above all from faith, which he can not conceive without charity. In 1895 he was called to direct, in Paris, a great Catholic magazine, La Quinzaine. But the splendours of the capital could not make him forget his native country: loving rustic simplicity, he soon resigned his directorial functions to return to Echauffour.

Damara horseshoe bat

The Damara horseshoe bat, "Rhinolophus damarensis", is a species of bat found in Africa.
Taxonomy and etymology.
It was described as a subspecies of Darling's horseshoe bat in 1946 by South African zoologist Austin Roberts.
It was largely maintained as a subspecies of Darling's horseshoe bat until 2013, when it was shown to be genetically distinct.
Its species name "damarensis" means "belonging to Damara." 
Roberts was possibly referencing Damaraland in Namibia.
Biology and ecology.
It is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places during the day such as caves and mines, particularly asbestos and gold mines.
It is a social species, forming colonies that generally consist of fewer than 100 individuals.
Range and habitat.
It is found in the eastern half of Southern Africa, with its range including Angola, Namibia, and South Africa.
Conservation.
It is currently assessed as least concern by the IUCN—its lowest conservation priority.
It meets the criteria for this assessment category because it has a large geographic range, as well as a population size of approximately 20,000 adults.
Potential threats to this species include habitat loss; the old mines that it uses as roosts are subject to disturbance if and when they are reopened.
Its range includes protected areas, such as ǀAi-ǀAis/Richtersveld Transfrontier Park and Augrabies Falls National Park.

Parliamentary elections was held in Mauritania in September 2018; the first round took place on 1 September, with a second round held on 15 September. At the national level, elections were held in 157 constituencies, each electing one member to the National Assembly. Elections were also held in 13 regional councils and 219 municipalities.
As a result of the election, Union for Republic (UPR) remained the single largest party at the national level both in terms of popular vote and seats.
Electoral system.
The 157 members of the National Assembly are elected by two methods; 113 are elected from single- or multi-member constituencies using either the two-round system or proportional representation; in single-member constituencies candidates require a majority of the vote to be elected in the first round and a plurality in the second round. In two-seat constituencies, voters vote for a party list (which must contain one man and one woman); if no list receives more than 50% of the vote in the first round, a second round is held, with the winning party taking both seats. In constituencies with three or more seats, closed list proportional representation is used, with seats allocated using the largest remainder method. For three-seat constituencies, party lists must include a female candidate in first or second on the list; for larger constituencies a zipper system is used, with alternate male and female candidates.
The other 40 seats are elected from a single nationwide constituency, also using closed list proportional representation, with half elected on separate lists reserved for women. A further four members are elected by the diaspora.

El Verdugo (short story)

El Verdugo is a short story by Honoré de Balzac, published in 1829. It one of the "Études philosophiques" in "La Comédie humaine".
Plot summary.
The story is set in Spain during the Peninsular War, in the coastal town of Menda. The occupying French garrison is commanded by a young officer named Victor Marchand, and he is in love with Clara, the daughter of Marquis Léganès, who is the local grandee. One night under cover of a local festival, there is an uprising against the French garrison, supported by British naval ships. The uprising is led by the Marquis and his sons. Marchand survives because he is warned by Clara, and as the last French survivor he flees to the nearby French military headquarters.
A few days later, the French retake Menda. The town surrenders without a fight, since the British had only sent ships with artillery, and no ground troops. The French general accepts the surrender, and promises not to loot and pillage the town in exchange for money, and the surrender of the leading citizens. The general then orders the hanging of the leaders of the uprising, including Marquis Léganès and his whole family.
Marquis Léganès asks the general, that he and his family be executed by beheading rather than hanging, and that his eldest son should be spared. The general agrees on condition that the son carry out the executions of his family. Léganès and the rest of his family persuade the eldest son, Juanito to agree. Marchand tries to persuade Clara that she will be spared if she agrees to marry him, but she refuses. Juanito then carries out the beheading of his father, two brothers and two sisters. The final intended victim is his mother which causes him to hesitate. She kills herself by jumping off the castle walls.
The story concludes by saying that Juanito does inherit his father's title. The King of Spain has given him the title of El Verdugo (the Executioner), but in his grief and guilt, Juanito shuns society.
Themes.
Sylvia Raphael wrote "..'El Verdugo' reminds us that the cruelty and heroism of war were as tragic in the days of the Peninsular War as they are now."
Balzac had planned to write a number of stories in the "Scènes de la vie militaire" section of "La Comedie humaine", but only completed two, "Les Chouans" and "Une passion dans le désert". However, "El Verdugo" is one of a number of works from other parts of "La Comedie humaine" along with "Le Médecin de campagne", "Adieu" and others which depict military scenes from the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.

Athelstan Braxton Hicks

Athelstan Braxton Hicks (19 June 1854 – 17 May 1902) was a coroner in London and Surrey for two decades at the end of the 19th century. He was given the nickname "The Children's Coroner" for his conscientiousness in investigating the suspicious deaths of children, and especially baby farming and the dangers of child life insurance. He would later publish a study on infanticide.
He was the son of Dr John Braxton Hicks, the well-known obstetrician, born in Tottenham, London.
Career.
He was a barrister at law who entered the Middle Temple in 1872 and was called to the bar in 1875. He was a special pleader on the Western Circuit and at the Middlesex Sessions. He was for some time a student at Guy's Hospital, where he gained considerable knowledge of medical jurisprudence. He was Deputy Coroner of the City of London and Borough of Southwark, the City of Westminster and the West London District. He was appointed Coroner in 1885 for the South-Western District of London and the Kingston Division of Surrey. For a time he served on the Joint Committee of the British Medical Association and the Coroners Society, of which he was honorary Secretary.
He wrote a pamphlet entitled "Hints to Medical Men Concerning the Granting of Certificates of Death" (London: William Clowes, 1889).
He made several reforms, notably that inquests were no longer held in public houses, and an improvement in providing local mortuaries.
He insisted that a full post-mortem be carried out on bodies. In 1898 he took a doctor, James Mackay, to court for perjury; Mackay had claimed to have performed a post-mortem on a 17-week child but when two other doctors examined the body they found no evidence that Mackay had done so.
Some of his more unusual inquests were the Pimlico poisoning by chloroform, the inquest on a body of a baby sent to the Home Secretary, the 'Lambeth Poisoning Case', the 'Tooting Horror', and the "Railway Murder" of Miss Camp.
One of his inquests, Elizabeth Jackson, has been linked, probably incorrectly, with the Jack the Ripper murders.
In the case of the 'Lambeth Gangs' he dealt with the murder of Henry Mappin by a street gang, the original Hooligans, who threatened witnesses and himself.
In the 'Battersea Cancer Cure' inquest he dealt with an unqualified "Dr Ferdinand" who advertised his claim to be able to cure cancer. It was not until the Cancer Act 1939 that advertisements for cancer cures were made illegal.
At the end of the 19th century there were more suicides from carbolic acid than from any other poison because there was no restriction on its sale. Braxton Hicks and other coroners called for its sale to be prohibited.
He gave evidence in 1890 and 1896 to the Select Committee on Infant Life Protection.
In 1899 Braxton Hicks wrote to the Home Secretary, Sir Matthew White Ridley, about the Police Order issued by the Metropolitan Commissioner of Police, Sir Edward Bradford, and the recovery of bodies in the Thames. In 1900 he succeeded in a reform of coroners being notified of the deaths of lunatics held in Poor Law Institutions.
In the Kingston District in 1901 he held 201 inquests: 121 males and 79 females with one case of treasure trove. The verdicts were murder 4 (3 newborn children), manslaughter 1, suicide 23, accidental 51, suffocated in bed 4, found drowned 10, excessive drinking 13, want of attention at birth 3. Infants under one year accounted for 42 of these. There were also 810 inquests in the South-Western district.
Infanticide.
Infanticide was common in the Victorian period for social reasons, such as illegitimacy, and the introduction of child life insurance additionally encouraged some women to kill their children for gain. Examples are Mary Ann Cotton, who murdered many of her 15 children as well as 3 husbands, Margaret Waters, the 'Brixton Baby Farmer', a professional baby-farmer who was found guilty of infanticide in 1870, Jessie King hanged in 1889, and Amelia Dyer, the 'Angel Maker', who murdered over 400 babies in her care.
Finding the dead bodies of murdered babies on the streets was common; 276 were recorded in London in 1870. Braxton Hicks held many inquests for bodies of children found in the street or on the banks of the Thames, such as in the 'Battersea Mystery', where the body of a baby was found by the Thames after being thrown into the water alive. The father was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 20 years. This was unusual, for example in the inquest of new born baby that died of head injuries the jury concluded that there was not sufficient evidence on its cause.
In many cases of infanticide the jury returned verdicts of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown but the police could not identify the child's parents. In another inquest in 1891 on the body of a baby girl found in the Thames "we have had about ten similar cases" where "as soon as the child is born, its head is knocked all to pieces and the body is then thrown into the river".
Obtaining convictions for the manslaughter of infants was difficult. For example, the case of Matilda Muncey, a registered baby farmer, who had had 36 children of whom 12 had died. She had an unregistered child, Evelina Marsh, who died of malnutrition. She was acquitted of manslaughter and was only fined £5 for neglecting to register the child and sent to prison for a month for not giving information to the coroner. The judge commented "that nothing was more likely to kill or more difficult of proof than the improper way of feeding."
Ada Chard-Williams.
The 1898 inquest on the body of a three months old girl who was strangled, "one of a series of cases in which children other than newly-born infants had recently been murdered and thrown away." There were other similar cases. He carried out the inquest on Selina Jones, whose body was washed up on the Thames at Battersea in 1899, and had been strangled by Ada Chard-Williams, a baby farmer who was later hanged at Newgate prison.
Amy Gregory.
Braxton Hicks held the inquest in 1895 on the death of Frances Maud Gregory, aged six weeks, the child of Amy Gregory (23), whose dead body was found on the ice in the Old Deer Park, Richmond. The mother was convicted of strangling her illegitimate child but granted a reprieve from execution by the Home Secretary. There were calls for more lenient sentences for infanticide leading to the comment "one reason why in all ages infanticide has been so lightly regarded is that it is a crime of which no man can in his own person by possibility be a victim. It is quite right that Amy Gregory should not be hanged; but the further cry that she should not be punished, is a plea that all women should be absolute over the lives of their little children." "Are we really going half-mad with pity for everybody except the totally defenceless? If not, why in the name of Christianity, as well as common-sense, do we object to the Home Secretary protecting babies of three months from being throttled?"
Overlaying.
Overlaying, where the child is accidentally smothered in bed, was common especially in overcrowded conditions or where the parents had been drinking. Braxton Hicks announced that he would disallow the expenses of the parents where he thought that the parents had been careless.
At an inquest in 1895 on the death by over-laying of a second child to a couple who had earlier received a caution, when the jury returned a verdict of accidental death he said
There had been "during the last ten months no less than 500 cases had occurred in which children had been suffocated while in bed with their parents, in London alone." He estimated that a third of the allegedly accidental deaths of children were due to suffocations.
However, he operated a poor box and could be generous when confronted with poverty: "it was no use reading the father a lesson on sleeping in a crowded room, for he was hard-up and could not pay for large apartments. The jury returned a verdict of "Accidental death," and expressed its opinion that the father had done the best he could in the circumstances."
Friendly Societies Act.
In 1889 Mr Braxton Hicks wrote a letter to "The Times" about the dangers of child life insurance, as outlined in the Friendly Societies Act 1875 which provided for payments on death of children, denouncing the practice of insuring children's lives to pay the expenses of their burial. He wrote that the insurances act as a temptation to the parents to neglect them, or feed them with improper food, and sometimes even to kill them, as in the excessively numerous cases of "over-laying" or suffocating in bed.
He then listed eleven proposals for amending the Act:-
He gave evidence in 1890 to the Committee of the House of Lords investigating Child Life Insurance. The recent Deptford poisoning case, where Mrs Winters had poisoned three people and set up multiple insurance policies, was raised.
The Friendly Societies Act 1896 subsequently did bring in limitations on the amount payable on the death of a child.
Stillbirth.
He also commented on the lack of recording of stillborn babies. Under British law stillborn babies were not registered and were not required to be buried in public burial grounds. Recording a birth as stillborn saved on funeral expenses and was a way of concealing infanticide. Undertakers would often store the bodies of stillborn babies for burial in adults' coffins for a small fee.
Amelia Hollis.
Braxton Hicks held inquests for two babies that were delivered by Amelia Hollis, a midwife, that were shown to have been suffocated after birth.
He was active against uncertified midwives and the dangers of midwives issuing certificates of stillbirth that could conceal infanticide. "At present it is the easiest thing in the world to dispose of an infant without anyone in authority being in the faintest degree wiser. Many newly-born infants are allowed to die, or are even murdered by the midwife who attends these houses, and it is positively this very interested individual who gives the certificate of still-birth."
He gave evidence in 1893 to the Select Committee about requiring the registration of stillbirths and the dangers of unregistered lying-in houses.
Obtaining manslaughter convictions for suffocating babies, which were then passed off as stillborn, was very difficult, as in the case of the death of Ernest Davy where Hollis was only found to have infringed the Registration Act by recording a stillbirth. Often women would have the charge reduced to concealment of birth. As noted by "The Spectator" in the Amy Gregory case "this is not one of the cases, unhappily so frequent, of infanticide, in which a mother distracted with shame and fear, has murdered her child almost at the moment of birth, and in which, by a conspiracy of mercy among Judges, doctors, and jurymen, a verdict is always returned of guilty only of concealment of birth."
Massacre of the Innocents.
In 1895 "The Sun" published an article "Massacre of the Innocents" highlighting the dangers of baby-farming, in the recording of stillbirths and quoting Braxton-Hicks on lying-in houses. "I have not the slightest doubt that a large amount of crime is covered by the expression 'still-birth'. There are a large number of cases of what are called newly-born children, which are found all over England, more especially in London and large towns, abandoned in streets, rivers, on commons, and so on. My opinion is that a great deal of that crime is due to what are called lying-in houses, which are not registered, or under the supervision of that sort, where the people who act as midwives constantly, as soon as the child is born, either drop it into a pail of water or smother it with a damp cloth. It is a very common thing, also, to find that they bash their heads on the floor and break their skulls. And it is a peculiar coincidence in these matters that at certain times we will have a concurrence of new-born children found, and their deaths all arising during a certain period of time in exactly the same way."
Registration was finally required by the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1926.
Baby farming.
He was active against the practise of baby-farming. The Infant Life Protection Act, 1872 had made registration with the local authority obligatory for any person taking in two or more infants under one year of age for a period greater than 24 hours. Also the Coroner had to be informed of the deaths of such infants.
In a reported case of baby farming Braxton Hicks said "Any child that dies in your quarter, where the cause is not as plain as a pike-staff, shall have an inquest held, and I'll have this case brought before the Children's Society."
The problem with the 1872 Act was that there were widespread exemptions, including relatives, day-nurses, hospitals and foster women. There was no 'authentification' of contracts between parent and baby-farmer. This was highlighted by the Arnold baby-farming inquest. He wrote to the Home Secretary about the case and in 1896 gave evidence to the Select Committee on Infant Life Protection Bill, with the Arnold case as one example.
The Arnold Baby-Farming Case.
Mrs Jane Arnold of Wolverton had been 'sweating' infants legally by doing so one at a time. She would take a lump sum for adoption and then pass the child on. She left a child with Mrs Saunders of Richmond and used her address for replies. Her activities came to light in an inquest in 1888 on the death of Isaac Arnold (alias John Bailey), aged 6 months, who died in Tooting. Arnold had placed the boy with Mrs Jessie Chapman of Tooting, who was licensed under the Infant Life Protection Act, and had already received another child, Edward Alexander Lovell, from her. Mrs Chapman notified the coroner. The jury returned a verdict of death from natural causes, but the activities of Mrs Arnold had been reported and were influential in leading to a change in the law. Braxton Hicks noted that she had had at least 25 infants and in his summing up he said:
In 1889 Mrs Arnold was again involved in the inquest of Edward Alexander Lovell, aged 2½, who died in an emaciated state at Newport Pagnell. The child had been received from a Mrs Williams of High Holborn, London when a month old with a payment of £30 for a year's keep. The boy was then handed over to Chapman in Thornton Heath, London, but when she did not receive her payments she returned the boy to Mrs Arnold. The jury were of the "opinion that there has been gross neglect in the case" but were unable to allocate responsibility. They added the rider that: "The jury are strongly of opinion that further legislation in what are usually known as baby farming cases is greatly needed, and particularly that the required legislation should extend to the care of one infant only, and that the age of the infant should not be limited to one year, but rather to five years and that it should be an offence for any person undertaking the care of such infant to sub farm it."
The Infant Life Protection Act of 1897 finally empowered local authorities to control the registration of nurses responsible for more than one infant under the age of five for a period longer than 48 hours. Under the Children's Act of 1908 "no infant could be kept in a home that was so unfit and so overcrowded as to endanger its health, and no infant could be kept by an unfit nurse who threatened, by neglect or abuse, its proper care and maintenance."
Accidental death.
Other causes of death were also dealt with. 
The 1908 Children's Act introduced legislation for the use of domestic fireguards.
In 1897 he was the principal witness before the Select Committee on Petroleum describing how the Coroners' Society wanted restrictions on the sale of cheap and dangerous paraffin lamps. He later wrote to "The Morning Post" about the safety standards of paraffin lamps.
At an inquest on a boating accident at Kew in which two men, Cazaly and Geraty, drowned, he "referred to the carelessness and indifference of watermen in letting out small boats to persons who possessed no knowledge of rowing", which led to the licensing of small boats.
He also campaigned for the control of the sale of poisons.
Personal life.
He married Fanny Sarah Sutton, daughter of Dr Sutton, in 1883 at St Gabriel's Church, Warwick Square. They had a daughter and a son, the pathologist John Athelstan Braxton Hicks M.D., M.R.C.P. (1885–1935).
He took a keen interest in promoting swimming for children and was president of the Battersea Swimming Club.
He died 17 May 1902 at his home in Lupus Street, Pimlico, from pneumonia. Following a service at St Gabriel's Church his funeral was at Norwood Cemetery on 21 May 1902.

William C. Mackie

William Charles Mackie (October 1, 1870 – August 1, 1931) was an American college football player and coach. He was an All-American guard at Harvard University and served as the head football coach at Bowdoin College. After football, Mackie practiced medicine and served as medical examiner for Norfolk County, Massachusetts.
Early life.
Mackie was born on October 1, 1870 in Boston to William B. and Mary Ann Mackie. He attended Boston Latin School and graduated from Harvard College in 1894 and Harvard Medical School in 1898.
Football.
Mackie played for the Harvard Crimson football team from 1891 to 1894. Before his first season with the team, Walter Camp described Mackie as "strong and active, knows what is required of him in both offence and defence, particularly the latter, and would steady up Harvard's center more than any man that could be selected". He started his sophomore year at center, but was moved to right guard before the 1892 Harvard-Yale game due to an injury to R. G. Acton. Mackie remained at right guard in 1893, while Acton moved to left guard. Mackie was named to the 1894 College Football All-America Team by John D. Merrill of "Leslie's Weekly" and S. V. R. Crosby of "The Boston Daily Globe".
In 1895, Mackie coached the Bowdoin College football team. On October 13, 1896, Mackie again became Bowdoin's coach. He took over for William Hoag, who left the team after three games. Bowdoin finished the season with a 5–3–2 overall record and a 3–3–1 under Mackie.
Medicine.
After graduating from medical school, Mackie worked as a general practitioner in Boston. In 1904 he moved to Brookline, Massachusetts and began practicing there. In 1912 he was appointed associate medical examiner for the 8th Norfolk District. During World War I, Mackie also served as Brookline's draft board examiner and was a member of the Volunteer Medical Corps. In February 1918, Mackie was appointed medical examiner of Norfolk County by Governor Samuel W. McCall. He was reappointed in 1925.
Personal life.
Mackie married Gerda Hooper Erickson on November 30, 1916. The couple had two daughters. He was a member of the General Church of the New Jerusalem. Mackie died on August 1, 1931 at his home in Brookline.

Schneider has authored several books, including "The Censor's Hand: The Misregulation of Human-Subject Research". 
Views on institutional review boards.
Schneider has argued that institutional review boards are unnecessary and harmful, restricting useful and innocuous research while being likely to permit truly dangerous studies. He stated in a 2018 lecture that IRBs are "deeply unethical system[s] of regulation" because they fail to reach consistent decisions and prohibit many experiments which have the potential to benefit patient health. Schneider cited a multi-center study of vitamin A supplementation for neonatal ICU patients which IRBs halted: one institution's IRB rejected the study because it considered the experiment unnecessary, claiming the benefits of vitamin A supplementation were proven; another denied it because it considered the effects of vitamin A on neonates too ill-studied to be ethical. He continued by noting that even without IRB approval, the doctors running the study would have had the ability to give or not give vitamin A to their patients, and even to collect data on the two groups. However, to compare the patients would require IRB approval.

Zipper system

The zipper system (also known as "vertical parity") is a method of drawing up party lists in proportional representation electoral systems. It requires candidates on the list to alternate between men and women in order to secure equal representation in candidacy and potentially elected members.
Use.
Some countries mandate the zipper system in their electoral laws. It was introduced in Italy in 1993, but overturned by the constitutional court in 1995. In countries without a legal requirement, parties may choose to implement the zipper system on their own lists, such as the Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP). The SAP's introduction of the zipper system in 1993 led to 48% of its in the 1994 general elections being female, and contributed to a record number of female MPs being elected to the Riksdag.

Rarriwuy Hick

Rarriwuy Hick (born ) is an Australian actress, known for her roles in the television series "Redfern Now", "Cleverman" and "Wentworth".
Biography.
Hick was born in Sydney, Australia. She grew up in both the suburb of Lilyfield, and in Dhalinybuy, an Aboriginal community in Arnhem Land, Northern Territory. She was raised speaking Yolŋu Matha and other Indigenous languages before learning English, and speaks seven dialects. Her mother, Janet Munyarryun, a Yolngu woman, was a founding member of Bangarra Dance Theatre. Her father is Paul Hick who was born in England.
Throughout her education, Hick was inspired by her mother to pursue dance and the arts. She attended a Catholic girls high school and showed sufficient interest in dance to establish a troupe. In 2009, she commenced studies at the National Aboriginal and Islander Skills Development Association (NAISDA) Dance College. She was asked to audition for the Aboriginal-produced play "Wrong Skin", and was successful, performing on the tour while studying.
Hick was living in Arnhem Land at the time of the 2007 Northern Territory National Emergency Response. She later remarked that the intervention was not having an effect on child abuse like intended and instead that her family's lives and finances were being "completely controlled by the government".
She established the dance group Yapa Mala and led its choreography. In 2011, she starred in the theatre play "Bloodland".
In May 2013, Hick and other actors from theatre production "The Shadow King" in Melbourne were refused taxi rides by several drivers who reportedly drove off after observing that the group members were of Indigenous appearance.
In 2016, Hick starred in a revival of the Louis Nowra play "The Golden Age" by the Sydney Theatre Company and her performance and dance received praise.
In 2018, Hick started a social media campaign using the hashtag #ourkidsbelongwithfamilies, which became a "rallying cry" of Indigenous Australians fighting to maintain their families together against removals and resettlement of children by authorities.

Naomi Wadler

Naomi Wadler (born October 16, 2006) is an American student and activist against gun violence. She has made speeches advocating for victims of gun violence in the United States, especially black female victims, most notably at the anti-gun protest March For Our Lives. She attends The Field School in Washington, DC. She is an 8th grader.
Personal life.
Wadler was adopted by Julie Wadler from an Ethiopian orphanage in 2007. Wadler's mother also adopted another daughter, Sarah, in 2009.
Wadler's African American father is a recreational hunter.
Wadler told "Elle" in April 2018 that she had been the victim of racism at her school because of her Jewish and Ethiopian heritages.
Political activism.
On March 14, 2018, Wadler helped organize a walkout of 60 fellow classmates at George Mason Elementary School. They stood in silence for 18 minutes: 17 minutes in memory of the 17 victims of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and one minute in memory of Courtlin Arrington, a black girl who had been a victim of gun violence at Huffman High School in Birmingham, Alabama.
On March 24, Wadler spoke to many people at March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C. She was the youngest speaker at the rally. She talked about why she pushed for the walkout and said that there's a disproportionate number of black female victims of gun violence in the United States. instead of holding the protest for 17 minutes like the people at the other schools, Wadler held the protest to last for 18 minutes. The extra minute was for a girl who was shot at her school in Alabama on March 7. Wadler was initially worried that discussing black female victims would be considered "off topic", but felt comfortable after finding out about "other students from all over would speak from their experiences". The speech became popular on Twitter, and was praised by black actresses.
Wadler subsequently spoke at the Women in the World Annual Summit and the "Teen Vogue" summit. Wadler received a standing ovation for her speech at the Tribeca Film Festival, where she received the Disruptive Innovation Award. Wadler mentioned a black woman who was killed in the Nashville Waffle House shooting on April 22, 2018, along with three black men. Wadler asserted that the perpetrator had been offered a bail, which was revoked after additional criminal charges, because he was white. Wadler was also a guest at "The Ellen DeGeneres Show". She spoke at the 2020 Davos Economic Forum highlighting racial disparities in addressing gun violence against black females in the United States saying: "White girls’ lives matter so much more than any black girl who dies in the inner city, or on the way to school. We don’t hear about them, they’re statistics." She was named one of "Teen Vogue" "21 Under 21" and shared a New York Magazine cover with actress Barbra Streisand.

SS America (1914)

America was a steam cargo ship built in 1914 by the Sørlandets Skibsbyggeri of Fevig for the Norge Mexico Gulf Linjen. She was ordered by the line before being acquired by Wilhelm Wilhelmsen.
Design and Construction.
In 1913 an English firm Fearnley &amp; Eger and Wilhelm Wilhelmsen established the "Norwegian Africa and Australia Line" (NAAL). At about the same time the two companies also took over the "Norge Mexico Gulf Linjen" (NMGL) involved in oil and oil products transportation to South America. NMGL ordered a new ship in 1913 before the acquisition, and "America" was completed for Wilhelm Wilhelmson for NOK 1,297,000.57 next year. The ship was laid down in 1913 at Sørlandets Skibsbyggeri shipyard in Fevig, launched on 3 September 1914 (yard number 169) and commissioned in October of the same year. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . "America" was assessed at 3,706 GRT, and 5,800 DWT. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 310 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to .
Operational history.
After completion "America" was put on the Norway-USA route connecting the East Coast ports of Boston and Philadelphia with Bergen and Kristiania. 
The vessel loaded up cargo, which included among other things granite, at Stavanger and then Bergen and departed for her maiden voyage on November 3, 1914 for Havana via Boston and other ports. The ship arrived at Boston on November 21 and departed the next day for Philadelphia where she arrived two days later. From Philadelphia "America" continued on her journey, called at Newport News on November 28 before proceeding to Havana the next day. "America" arrived in Havana on December 4, unloaded her cargo and departed Cuba on December 11 for Galveston which she reached two days later. After taking on cargo, the ship departed for Kristiania via Gulf ports and Newport News and arrived at her destination on January 29, 1915.
"America" departed for her next and final voyage from Kristiania to Boston on February 25, 1915. She carried about 7,000 bales of cellulose, 1,400 bales of tree pulp, 1,800 boxes of canned goods and was not fully loaded. The ship arrived at Boston on March 13, and after unloading left Boston on March 19 for Philadelphia, arriving there three days later.
Sinking.
"America" departed from Philadelphia on 28 March 1915 for her final voyage to Bergen with approximately 5,000 tons of general cargo. She had to stop at Kirkwall for inspection by the British authorities and spent 4 days there, departing 16 April 1915 to Sunderland. Upon arrival there next day, she had to unload part of her cargo including oil, leather and food supplies deemed to be contraband by the British. She left from Sunderland on 1 May 1915 with only 1,500 tons of cargo. Shortly after 22:00 on May 1, about east-northeast from the Longstone Lighthouse the ship was struck on port side in her engine room by a torpedo. The vessel quickly filled up with water, forcing her Captain Johan Endresen to order the crew to abandon ship. Three lifeboats were lowered and all 37 crew left the ship. "America" sank stern first at about 00:50 on May 2 in an approximate position . The torpedo was launched by the German submarine .

In 2020, Taylor opened up about her struggles with her mental health such as anxiety.
Career.
Juniors.
At the 2012 'British Junior National Championships' Taylor became Under-14 girls' singles winner beating Katie Swan in the final 7–6(7), 6–3. Later in the year she was runner-up at the world's most prestigious junior tournament Junior Orange Bowl losing to Maia Lumsden 6–3, 7–5, both players having been semifinalists in that year's European equivalent the Petits As. The following year the two players teamed up to become Under-16 British National Junior Champions in the Doubles competition.
Taylor, Katie Swan, Freya Christie and Maia Lumsden were members of the 2014 British team, coached by Judy Murray, that triumphed in the Maureen Connolly Challenge Trophy, an annual Under-18's competition against the USA.
2015.
In November Taylor won her first ITF title in South Africa, unseeded she came from a set down to upset top seeded Naomi Totka of Hungary in three sets.
2016 – Wimbledon Juniors 'poisoning' incident and recovery.
In 2016, Taylor achieved her best juniors results in her sole Junior Grand Slam appearance at Wimbledon. She reached the quarterfinals but had to retire in the following match against Kayla Day. Taylor contracted a bacterial infection called leptospirosis, which would keep her from playing tennis for a month. Initially, she was thought to have been poisoned while her bag was left unoccupied, however, medical experts declared this to be highly unlikely. Police later concluded that there was no evidence of deliberate poisoning.
Taylor recovered sufficiently to reach three consecutive ITF finals at Heraklion, Greece in October and November although failing to win any.
2017.
In May, as the sixth seed, she won her first 25k tournament, beating third seed Danielle Lao in the final in straight sets. Wimbledon granted wild card entries to her in both the singles and the doubles (partnering Freya Christie) qualifying draws, losing both in the first round. In November she began working with coaches Xavier Budo and David Sunyer, which she credits with changing her mindset, leading to her most successful period to date.
2018.
After three ITF title wins in February and March, Taylor broke into the top 200 rankings for the first time. She was subsequently chosen to represent Great Britain in the Fed Cup team alongside Johanna Konta, Heather Watson and Anna Smith for the World Group II play-off tie in Japan, however she did not play in any of the matches.
Taylor made her WTA Tour main-draw debut at the 2018 Nottingham Open. As a wild-card entry, she lost in the first round to the defending champion Donna Vekić, in three sets. In her first appearance in the main draw at Wimbledon, she lost to Eugenie Bouchard in three sets.

Minutes Before Six

Minutes Before Six (est. 2007) is an American blog that publishes articles, poetry and art from inmates held in prison in the United States. The website was founded by former Texas death row inmate Thomas Bartlett Whitaker with the help of volunteers in the free world. The name of the website refers to the hour (6 PM Central Time) at which (barring any pending appeals not decided) executions start to take place in Texas. The website provides a channel for prisoners (without access to the internet) to express themselves to the outside world. 
Prisoners send their contribution by postal mail to the Editor, Dina Milito. Volunteers then digitize them and post them online. Minutes Before Six is a nonprofit organization (EIN #82- 3422504). Milito, a victim of violent assault seeking to understand violence, wrote to Whitaker and other condemned inmates and is an opponent of capital punishment. Eventually the blog expanded to include other writers from prisons throughout the USA.

Bombing of Tokyo (10 March 1945)

On the night of 9/10 March 1945, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) conducted a devastating firebombing raid on Tokyo, the Japanese capital city. This attack was code-named Operation Meetinghouse by the USAAF and is known as the Great Tokyo Air Raid in Japan. Bombs dropped from 279 Boeing B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers burned out much of eastern Tokyo. More than 90,000 and possibly over 100,000 Japanese people were killed, mostly civilians, and one million were left homeless, making it the most destructive single air attack in human history. The Japanese air and civil defenses proved largely inadequate; 14 American aircraft and 96 airmen were lost.
The attack on Tokyo was an intensification of the air raids on Japan which had begun in June 1944. Prior to this operation, the USAAF had focused on a precision bombing campaign against Japanese industrial facilities. These attacks were generally unsuccessful, which contributed to the decision to shift to firebombing. The operation during the early hours of 10 March was the first major firebombing raid against a Japanese city, and the USAAF units employed significantly different tactics from those used in precision raids, including bombing by night with the aircraft flying at low altitudes. The extensive destruction caused by the raid led to these tactics becoming standard for the USAAF's B-29s until the end of the war.
There has been a long-running debate over the morality of the 10 March firebombing of Tokyo. The raid is often cited as a key example in criticism of the Allies' strategic bombing campaigns, with many historians and commentators arguing that it was not acceptable for the USAAF to deliberately target civilians, and other historians stating that the USAAF had no choice but to change to area bombing tactics given that the precision bombing campaign had failed. It is generally acknowledged that the tactics used against Tokyo and in similar subsequent raids were militarily successful. The attack is commemorated at two official memorials, several neighborhood memorials, and a privately run museum.
Background.
Pre-war USAAF doctrine emphasized the precision bombing of key industrial facilities over area bombing of cities. Early American strategic bombing attacks on Germany used precision tactics, with the bomber crews seeking to visually identify their targets. This proved difficult to achieve in practice. During the last 20 months of the war in Europe, non-visual attacks accounted for about half of the American strategic bombing campaign against Germany. These included major area bombing raids on Berlin and Dresden, as well as attacks on several towns and cities conducted as part of Operation Clarion. The American attacks on Germany mainly used high-explosive bombs, with incendiary bombs accounting for only 14 percent of those dropped by the Eighth Air Force. The British Bomber Command focused on destroying German cities from early 1942 until the end of the war, and incendiaries represented 21 percent of the tonnage of bombs its aircraft dropped. Area bombing of German cities by Allied forces resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians and massive firestorm in cities such as Hamburg and Dresden.
Japanese forces conducted area bombing attacks on Chinese cities throughout the war. Few attempts were made to target industrial facilities, with the goal of the campaign being to terrorize civilians and cut the Chinese forces off from their sources of supplies. Chongqing, China's provisional capital, was frequently attacked by aircraft using incendiary and high explosive bombs. These raids destroyed most of the city.
The American Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942 was the first air attack on Tokyo, but inflicted little damage on the city. In June 1944 the USAAF's XX Bomber Command began a campaign against Japan using B-29 Superfortress bombers flying from airfields in China. Tokyo was beyond the range of Superfortresses operating from China, and was not attacked. This changed in October 1944, when the B-29s of the XXI Bomber Command began moving into airfields in the Mariana Islands. These islands were close enough to Japan for the B-29s to conduct a sustained bombing campaign against Tokyo and most other Japanese cities. The first Superfortress flight over Tokyo took place on 1November, when a reconnaissance aircraft photographed industrial facilities and urban areas in the western districts of the city. The remainder of Tokyo was photographed in subsequent reconnaissance flights, and these images were used to plan the 10 March raid and other attacks on urban areas.
The overall plan for the strategic bombing campaign against Japan specified that it would commence with precision bombing raids against key industrial facilities, and later include firebombing attacks on cities. The first target directive issued to the XXI Bomber Command by its parent unit, the Twentieth Air Force, on 11 November, 1944 specified that the main target was Japanese aircraft and aviation engine factories. These targets were to be attacked by precision bombing. Japanese cities were specified as the secondary target, with area bombing being authorized for use against them. The directive also indicated that firebombing raids were likely to be ordered against cities to test the effectiveness of this tactic. The Twentieth Air Force had an unusual command structure, as it was personally headed by General Henry H. Arnold, the commanding officer of the USAAF.
B-29 raids on Tokyo commenced on 24 November. The first raid targeted an aircraft engine factory on the city's outskirts, and caused little damage. XXI Bomber Command's subsequent raids on Tokyo and other cities mainly used precision bombing tactics and high explosive bombs, and were largely unsuccessful due to adverse weather conditions and a range of mechanical problems which affected the B-29s. These failures led to the head of the Command being relieved in January 1945. Major General Curtis LeMay, the commander of XX Bomber Command, replaced him. Arnold and the Twentieth Air Force's headquarters regarded the campaign against Japan up to that time as unsuccessful, and LeMay understood that he would also be relieved if he failed to deliver results. LeMay believed that changing the emphasis from precision bombing to area bombing was the most promising option to turn the XXI Bomber Command's performance around.
Preparations.
Early incendiary raids on Japan.
USAAF planners began assessing the feasibility of a firebombing campaign against Japanese cities in 1943. Japan's main industrial facilities were vulnerable to such attacks as they were concentrated in several large cities, and a high proportion of production took place in homes and small factories in urban areas. The planners estimated that incendiary bomb attacks on Japan's six largest cities could cause physical damage to almost 40 percent of industrial facilities and result in the loss of 7.6 million man-months of labor. It was also estimated that these attacks would kill over 500,000 people, render about 7.75 million homeless and force almost 3.5 million to be evacuated. The plans for the strategic bombing offensive against Japan developed in 1943 specified that it would transition from a focus on the precision bombing of industrial targets to area bombing from around halfway in the campaign, which was forecast to be in March 1945.
Preparations for firebombing raids against Japan began well before March 1945. In 1943 the USAAF tested the effectiveness of incendiary bombs on adjoining German and Japanese-style domestic building complexes at the Dugway Proving Ground. These trials demonstrated that M69 incendiaries were particularly effective at starting uncontrollable fires. These weapons were dropped from B-29s in clusters, and used napalm as their incendiary filler. After the bomb struck the ground, a fuse ignited a charge which first sprayed napalm from the weapon, and then ignited it. Prior to March 1945, stockpiles of incendiary bombs were built up in the Mariana Islands. These were accumulated on the basis of XXI Bomber Command plans which specified that the B-29s would each carry of the weapons on 40 percent of their monthly sorties. Arnold and the Air Staff wanted to wait to use the incendiaries until a large-scale program of firebombing could be mounted, to overwhelm the Japanese city defenses.
Several raids were conducted to test the effectiveness of firebombing against Japanese cities. A small incendiary attack was made against Tokyo on the night of 29/30 November 1944, but caused little damage. Incendiaries were also used as part of several other raids. On 18 December 84 XX Bomber Command B-29s conducted an incendiary raid on the Chinese city of Hankou which caused extensive damage. That day, the Twentieth Air Force directed XXI Bomber Command to dispatch 100 B-29s on a firebombing raid against Nagoya. An initial attack took place on 22 December which was directed at an aircraft factory and involved 78 bombers using precision bombing tactics. Few of the incendiaries landed in the target area. On 3January, 97 Superfortresses were dispatched to firebomb Nagoya. This attack started some fires, which were soon brought under control by firefighters. The success in countering the raid led the Japanese authorities to become over-confident about their ability to protect cities against incendiary attacks. The next firebombing raid was directed against Kobe on 4February, and bombs dropped from 69 B-29s started fires which destroyed or damaged 1,039 buildings.
On 19 February the Twentieth Air Force issued a new targeting directive for XXI Bomber Command. While the Japanese aviation industry remained the primary target, the directive placed a stronger emphasis on firebombing raids against Japanese cities. The directive also called for a large-scale trial incendiary raid as soon as possible. This attack was made against Tokyo on 25 February. A total of 231 B-29s were dispatched, of which 172 arrived over the city; this was XXI Bomber Command's largest raid up to that time. The attack was conducted in daylight, with the bombers flying in formation at high altitudes. It caused extensive damage, with almost 28,000 buildings being destroyed. This was the most destructive raid to have been conducted against Japan, and LeMay and the Twentieth Air Force judged that it demonstrated that large-scale firebombing was an effective tactic.
The failure of a precision bombing attack on an aircraft factory in Tokyo on 4March marked the end of the period in which XXI Bomber Command primarily conducted such raids. Civilian casualties during these operations had been relatively low; for instance, all the raids against Tokyo prior to 10 March caused 1,292 deaths in the city.
Preparations to attack Tokyo.
In early March, LeMay judged that further precision bombing of Japanese industrial targets was unlikely to be successful due to the prevailing weather conditions over the country. There were on average only seven days of clear skies each month, and an intense jet stream made it difficult to aim bombs from high altitudes. Due to these constraints, LeMay decided to focus XXI Bomber Command's attacks on Japanese cities. While he made this decision on his own initiative, the general directions issued to LeMay permitted such operations. On 5March XXI Bomber Command's personnel were advised that no further major attacks would be scheduled until 9March. During this period LeMay's staff finalized plans for the attack on Tokyo. At a meeting on 7March, LeMay agreed to conduct an intense series of raids against targets on the island of Honshu between 9and 22 March as part of the preparations for the invasion of Okinawa on 1April.
LeMay decided to adopt radically different tactics for this campaign. Analysis by XXI Bomber Command staff of the 25 February raid concluded that the incendiary bombs had been dropped from too high an altitude, and attacking at lower levels would both improve accuracy and enable the B-29s to carry more bombs. This would also expose them to the Japanese air defenses, but LeMay judged that poor Japanese fire control tactics meant that the additional risk was moderate. As weather conditions over Japan tended to be more favorable at night and the LORAN systems the B-29s used to navigate were more effective after dusk, it was also decided to conduct the attack at night. This led to a decision to direct the aircraft to attack individually rather than in formations as it was not possible for the B-29s to keep station at night. Flying individually would also lead to reductions in fuel consumption as the pilots would not need to constantly adjust their engines to remain in formation. These fuel savings allowed the Superfortresses to carry twice their usual bomb load. USAAF intelligence had determined that the Japanese had only two night fighter units, and these were believed to pose little threat. As a result, LeMay decided to remove all of the B-29s' guns other than those at the rear of the aircraft to reduce the weight of the aircraft and further boost the weight of bombs they could carry. While LeMay made the ultimate decision to adopt the new tactics, he acknowledged that his plan combined ideas put forward by many officers. On 7March, some of the B-29 crews flew training missions in which they practiced using radar to navigate and attack a target from low altitude. The airmen were not told the purpose of this training.
The officers who commanded XXI Bomber Command's three flying wings agreed with the new tactics, but there were fears that they could result in heavy casualties. These concerns were shared by some of LeMay's staff. XXI Bomber Command's intelligence officers predicted that 70 percent of the bombers could be destroyed. LeMay consulted Arnold's chief of staff Brigadier General Lauris Norstad about the new tactics, but did not formally seek approval to adopt them. He later justified this action on the grounds that he had wanted to protect Arnold from blame had the attack been a failure. LeMay notified the Twentieth Air Force headquarters of his intended tactics on 8March, a day he knew Arnold and Norstad would be absent. There is no evidence that LeMay expected that the Twentieth Air Force would object to firebombing civilian areas, but he may have been concerned that it would have judged that the new tactics were too risky.
Japanese defenses.
The Japanese military anticipated that the USAAF would make major night attacks on the Tokyo region. After several small night raids were conducted on the region during December 1944 and January 1945, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force's 10th Air Division, which was responsible for intercepting attacks on the Kantō region, placed a greater emphasis on training its pilots to operate at night. One of the division's flying regiments (the 53rd Air Regiment) was also converted to a specialized night fighter unit. On the night of 3/4 March, the Japanese military intercepted American radio signals which indicated that the XXI Bomber Command was conducting a major night flying exercise. This was interpreted to mean that the force was preparing to start large-scale night raids on Japan. However, the Japanese did not expect the Americans to change to low altitude bombing tactics.
The military forces assigned to protect Tokyo were insufficient to stop a major raid. The Eastern District Army's Kanto Air Defense Sector was responsible for the air defense of the Tokyo region, and was accorded the highest priority for aircraft and antiaircraft guns. The 1st Antiaircraft Division controlled the antiaircraft guns stationed in the central region of Honshu, including Tokyo. It was made up of eight regiments with a total of 780 antiaircraft guns, as well as a regiment equipped with searchlights. American military intelligence estimated that 331 heavy and 307 light antiaircraft guns were allocated to Tokyo's defenses at the time of the raid. A network of picket boats, radar stations and lookout posts was responsible for detecting incoming raids. Due to shortages of radar and other fire control equipment, Japanese antiaircraft gunners found it difficult to target aircraft operating at night. The radar stations had a short range and fire control equipment for the antiaircraft batteries was unsophisticated. As of March 1945, most of the 10th Air Division's 210 combat aircraft were day fighters, with the 53rd Air Regiment operating 25 or 26 night fighters. The regiment was experiencing difficulties converting to the night fighter role, which included an overly intensive training program that exhausted its pilots.
Tokyo's civil defenses were also lacking. The city's fire department comprised around 8,000 firemen spread between 287 fire stations, but they had little modern firefighting equipment. The firefighting tactics used by the fire department were ineffective against incendiary bombs. Civilians had been organized into more than 140,000 neighborhood firefighting associations with a nominal strength of 2.75 million people, but these were also ill-equipped. The basic equipment issued to the firefighting associations was incapable of extinguishing fires started by M69s. Few air raid shelters had been constructed, though most households dug crude foxholes to shelter in near their homes. Firebreaks had been created across the city in an attempt to stop the spread of fire; over 200,000 houses were destroyed as part of this effort. Rubble was often not cleared from the firebreaks, which provided a source of fuel. The Japanese Government also encouraged children and civilians with non-essential jobs to evacuate Tokyo, and 1.7 million had departed by March 1945. However, many other civilians had moved into Tokyo from impoverished rural areas over the same period.
Attack.
Departure.
On 8 March, LeMay issued orders for a major firebombing attack on Tokyo the next night. The raid was to target a rectangular area in northeastern Tokyo designated Zone I by the USAAF which measured approximately by . This area was divided by the Sumida River, and included most of Asakusa, Honjo and Fukagawa Wards. These wards formed part of the informally defined Shitamachi district of Tokyo, which was mainly populated by working-class people and artisans. With a population of around 1.1 million, it was one of the most densely populated urban areas in the world. Zone I contained few militarily significant industrial facilities, though there were a large number of small factories which supplied Japan's war industries. The area was highly vulnerable to firebombing, as most buildings were constructed from wood and bamboo and were closely spaced. Due to this vulnerability, it had suffered extensive damage and heavy casualties from fires caused by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. The United States' intelligence services were aware of how vulnerable the region remained to fire, with the Office of Strategic Services rating it as containing the most combustible districts in Tokyo.
The orders for the raid issued to the B-29 crews stated that the main purpose of the attack was to destroy the many small factories located within the target area, but also noted that it was intended to cause civilian casualties as a means of disrupting production at major industrial facilities. Each of XXI Bomber Command's three wings was allocated a different altitude to bomb from, in bands between and . These altitudes were calculated to be too high for the light Japanese antiaircraft guns to reach, and below the effective range of the heavy antiaircraft guns.
LeMay was unable to lead the raid in person as he had been prohibited from placing himself in a situation where he could be captured after being briefed on the development of atomic bombs. Instead, the attack was led by the 314th Bombardment Wing's commanding officer, Brigadier General Thomas S. Power. LeMay considered Power to be the best of the wing commanding officers. The new tactics which were to be used in the operation were not well received by many airmen, who believed that it was safer to bomb from high altitudes and preferred to retain their defensive guns. Leaving behind the unneeded gunners also troubled many of the airmen, as bomber crews typically had a very close relationship.
In preparation for the attack, XXI Bomber Command's maintenance staff worked intensively over a 36-hour period to ready as many aircraft as possible. This effort proved successful, and 83 percent of the B-29s were available for action compared to the average serviceability rate of 60 percent. Other ground crew loaded the aircraft with bombs and fuel. A total of 346 B-29s were readied. The 73rd Bombardment Wing contributed 169 B-29s and the 313th Bombardment Wing 121; both units were based on Saipan. At the time of the raid the 314th Bombardment Wing was arriving at Guam in the Marianas, and able to provide only 56 B-29s. The B-29s in the squadrons which were scheduled to arrive over Tokyo first were armed with M47 bombs; these weapons used napalm and were capable of starting fires which required mechanized firefighting equipment to control. The bombers in the other units were loaded with clusters of M69s. The 73rd and 313th Bomb Wings' Superfortresses were each loaded with of bombs. As the 314th Bombardment Wing's B-29s would have to fly a greater distance, they each carried of bombs.
The attack force began departing its bases at 5:35 pm local time on 9March. It took two and three quarter hours for all of the 325 B-29s which were dispatched to take off. Turbulence was encountered on the flight to Japan, but the weather over Tokyo was good. There was little cloud cover, and visibility was good for the first bomber crews to arrive over Tokyo; they were able to see clearly for . Conditions on the ground were cold and windy, with the city experiencing gusts of between and blowing from the southeast.
The first B-29s over Tokyo were four aircraft tasked with guiding the others in. These Superfortresses arrived over the city shortly before midnight on 9March. They carried extra fuel, additional radios and XXI Bomber Command's best radio operators instead of bombs, and circled Tokyo at an altitude of throughout the raid. This tactic proved unsuccessful, and was later judged to have been unnecessary.
Over Tokyo.
The attack on Tokyo commenced at 12:08 am local time on 10 March. Pathfinder bombers simultaneously approached the target area at right angles to each other. These bombers were manned by the 73d and 313th Bombardment Wings' best crews. Their M47 bombs rapidly started fires in an "X" shape, which was used to direct the attacks for the remainder of the force. Each of XXI Bomber Command's wings and their subordinate groups had been briefed to attack different areas within the "X" shape to ensure that the raid caused widespread damage. As the fires expanded, the American bombers spread out to attack unaffected parts of the target area. Power's B-29 circled Tokyo for 90 minutes, with a team of cartographers who were assigned to him mapping the spread of the fires.
The raid lasted for approximately two hours and forty minutes. Visibility over Tokyo decreased over the course of the raid due to the extensive smoke over the city. This led some American aircraft to bomb parts of Tokyo well outside the target area. The heat from the fires also resulted in the final waves of aircraft experiencing heavy turbulence. Some American airmen also needed to use oxygen masks when the odor of burning flesh entered their aircraft. A total of 279 B-29s attacked Tokyo, dropping of bombs. Another 19 Superfortresses which were unable to reach Tokyo struck targets of opportunity or targets of last resort. These aircraft turned back early due to mechanical problems or pilots deciding to abort the main mission because they were afraid of being killed.
Tokyo's defenders were expecting an attack, but did not detect the American force until it arrived over the city. The air defense units in the Kanto Plain area had been placed on alert, but the night fighter units were instructed not to sortie any aircraft until an incoming raid was detected. While picket boats spotted the attack force, poor radio reception meant that most of their reports were not received. Due to disorganization in the defense commands, little action was taken on the scattered reports which came in from the boats. At around midnight on 9March a small number of B-29s were detected near Katsuura, but were thought to be conducting reconnaissance flights. Subsequent sightings of B-29s flying at low levels were not taken seriously, and the Japanese radar stations focused on searching for American aircraft operating at their usual high altitudes. The first alarm that a raid was in progress was issued at 12:15 am, just after the B-29s began dropping bombs on Tokyo. The 10th Air Division sortied all of its available night interceptors, and the 1st Antiaircraft Division's searchlight and antiaircraft units went into action.
As expected by LeMay, the defense of Tokyo was not effective. Many American units encountered considerable antiaircraft fire, but it was generally aimed at altitudes either above or below the bombers and reduced in intensity over time as gun positions were overwhelmed by fires. Nevertheless, the Japanese gunners shot down 12 B-29s. A further 42 were damaged, of which two had to be written off. The Japanese fighters were ineffective; their pilots received no guidance from radar stations and the efforts of the antiaircraft gunners and fighter units were not coordinated. No B-29s were shot down by fighters, and the American airmen reported only 76 sightings of Japanese fighters and 40 attacks by them over the course of the raid. Several Japanese pilots were killed when their aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed. Five of the downed B-29s managed to ditch in the sea, and their crews were rescued by United States Navy submarines. American casualties were 96 airmen killed or missing, and 6wounded or injured.
The surviving B-29s arrived back at their bases in the Mariana Islands between 6:10 and 11:27 am local time on 10 March. Many of the bombers were streaked with ashes from the fires their crews had caused.
On the ground.
Widespread fires rapidly developed across northeastern Tokyo. Within 30 minutes of the start of the raid the situation was beyond the fire department's control. An hour into the raid the fire department abandoned its efforts to stop the conflagration. Instead, the firemen focused on guiding people to safety and rescuing those trapped in burning buildings. Over 125 firemen and 500 civil guards who had been assigned to help them were killed, and 96 fire engines destroyed.
Driven by the strong wind, the large numbers of small fires started by the American incendiaries rapidly merged into major blazes. These formed firestorms which quickly advanced in a northwesterly direction and destroyed or damaged almost all the buildings in their path. The only buildings which survived the fire were constructed of stone. By an hour after the start of the attack most of eastern Tokyo either had been destroyed or was being affected by fires.
Civilians who stayed at their homes or attempted to fight the fire had virtually no chance of survival. Historian Richard B. Frank has written that "the key to survival was to grasp quickly that the situation was hopeless and flee". Soon after the start of the raid news broadcasts began advising civilians to evacuate as quickly as possible, but not all did so immediately. The foxholes which had been dug near most homes offered no protection against the firestorm, and civilians who sheltered in them were burned to death or died from suffocation.
Thousands of the evacuating civilians were killed. Families often sought to remain with their local neighborhood associations, but it was easy to become separated in the conditions. Few families managed to stay together throughout the night. Escape frequently proved impossible, as smoke reduced visibility to just a few feet and roads were rapidly cut by the fires. Crowds of civilians often panicked as they rushed towards the perceived safety of canals, with those who fell being crushed to death. The majority of those killed in the raid died while trying to evacuate. In many cases entire families were killed. One of the most deadly incidents occurred when the full bomb load of a B-29 landed in a crowd of civilians crossing the Kototoi Bridge over the Sumida River causing hundreds of people to be burned to death.
Few places in the targeted area provided safety. Many of those who attempted to evacuate to the large parks which had been created as refuges against fires following the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake were killed when the conflagration moved across these open spaces. Similarly, thousands of people who gathered in the grounds of the Sensō-ji temple in Asakusa died. Others sheltered in solid buildings, such as schools or theatres, and in canals. These were not proof against the firestorm, with smoke inhalation and heat killing large numbers of people in schools. Many of the people who attempted to shelter in canals were killed by smoke or when the passing firestorm sucked oxygen out of the area. However, these bodies of water provided safety to thousands of others. The fire finally burned itself out during mid-morning on 10 March, and came to a stop when it reached large open areas or the Nakagawa Canal. Thousands of people injured in the raid died over the following days.
After the raid, civilians across Tokyo offered assistance to the refugees. Firemen, police officers and soldiers also tried to rescue survivors trapped under collapsed buildings. Many refugees who had previously lived in slums were accommodated in prosperous parts of the city. Some of these refugees resented the differences in living conditions, prompting riots and looting. Refugee centers were also established in parks and other open areas. Over a million people left the city in the following weeks, with more than 90 percent being accommodated in nearby prefectures. Due to the extent of the damage and the exodus from Tokyo, no attempt was made to restore services to large sections of the city.
Aftermath.
Casualties.
Estimates of the number of people killed in the bombing of Tokyo on 10 March differ. After the raid, 79,466 bodies were recovered and recorded. Many other bodies were not recovered, and the city's director of health estimated that 83,600 people were killed and another 40,918 wounded. The Tokyo fire department put the casualties at 97,000 killed and 125,000 wounded, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department believed that 124,711 people had been killed or wounded. After the war, the United States Strategic Bombing Survey estimated the casualties as 87,793 killed and 40,918 injured. The survey also stated that the majority of the casualties were women, children and elderly people. Frank wrote in 1999 that historians generally believe that there were between 90,000 and 100,000 fatalities, but some argue that the number was much higher. For instance, Edwin P. Hoyt stated in 1987 that 200,000 people had been killed and in 2009 Mark Selden wrote that the number of deaths may have been several times the estimate of 100,000 used by the Japanese and United States Governments. As of 2011, the Tokyo Memorial Hall honored 105,400 people killed in the raid, the number of people whose ashes are interred in the building or were claimed by their family. As many bodies were not recovered, the number of fatalities is higher than this number. The large population movements out of and into Tokyo in the period before the raid, deaths of entire communities and destruction of records mean that it is not possible to know exactly how many died.
Most of the bodies which were recovered were buried in mass graves without being identified. Many bodies of people who had died while attempting to shelter in rivers were swept into the sea and never recovered. Attempts to collect bodies ceased 25 days after the raid.
The raid also caused widespread destruction. Police records show that 267,171 buildings were destroyed, which represented a quarter of all buildings in Tokyo at the time. This destruction rendered 1,008,005 survivors homeless. Most buildings in the Asakusa, Fukagawa, Honjo, Jōtō and Shitaya wards were destroyed, and seven other districts of the city experienced the loss of around half their buildings. Parts of another 14 wards suffered damage. Overall, of Tokyo was burned out. The number of people killed and area destroyed was the largest of any single air raid of World War II, including the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when each raid is considered by itself. The casualties and damage caused by the raid and absenteeism by workers in Tokyo considerably disrupted the Japanese war economy.
Reactions.
LeMay and Arnold considered the operation to have been a significant success on the basis of reports made by the airmen involved and the extensive damage shown in photographs taken by reconnaissance aircraft on 10 March. Arnold sent LeMay a congratulatory message which stated that "this mission shows your crews have the guts for anything". The aircrew who conducted the attack were also pleased with its results. A post-strike assessment by XXI Bomber Command attributed the scale of damage to the firebombing being concentrated on a specific area, with the bombers attacking within a short timeframe, and the strong winds present over Tokyo.
Few concerns were raised in the United States during the war about the morality of the 10 March attack on Tokyo or the firebombing of other Japanese cities. These tactics were supported by the majority of decision-makers and American civilians. Historian Michael Howard has observed that these attitudes reflected the limited options to end the war which were available at the time. For instance, both Arnold and LeMay regarded the 10 March raid and subsequent firebombing operations as being necessary to save American lives by bringing the war to a rapid conclusion. President Franklin D. Roosevelt probably also held this view. While Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson was aware of LeMay's tactics and troubled by the lack of public reaction in the United States to the firebombing of Tokyo, he permitted these operations to continue until the end of the war.
The raid was followed by similar attacks against Nagoya on the night of 11/12 March, Osaka in the early hours of 14 March, Kobe on 17/18 March and Nagoya again on 18/19 March. An unsuccessful night precision raid was also conducted against an aircraft engine factory in Nagoya on 23/24 March. The firebombing attacks ended only because XXI Bomber Command's stocks of incendiaries were exhausted. The attacks on Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Kobe during March burned out over of the cities. The number of people killed in Nagoya, Osaka and Kobe were much lower than those in 10 March attack on Tokyo with fewer than 10,000 fatalities in each operation. The lower casualties were, in part, the result of better preparations by the Japanese authorities which had resulted from a realization that they had greatly under-estimated the threat posed by firebombing.
The Japanese government initially attempted to suppress news of the extent of the 10 March raid, but later used it for propaganda purposes. A communique issued by the Imperial Headquarters on 10 March stated that only "various places within the city were set afire". However, rumors of the devastation rapidly spread across the country. In a break from the usual practice of downplaying the damage caused by air attacks, the Japanese Government encouraged the media to emphasize the extensive scale of the destruction in an attempt to motivate anger against the United States. Stories about the attack were on the front page of all Japanese newspapers on 11 March. Reporting focused on the perceived immorality of the attack and the number of B-29s which had been destroyed. Subsequent newspaper reports made little reference to the scale of casualties, and the few photos which were published showed little physical damage. When the Japanese Government's official broadcaster Radio Tokyo reported the attack it was labeled "slaughter bombing". Other radio broadcasts focused on B-29 losses and the claimed desire of Japanese civilians to continue the war. American newspaper reports focused on the physical damage to Tokyo, made little reference to casualties and did not include estimates of the death toll. This resulted from the content of USAAF communiques and reports rather than censorship.
The attack considerably damaged the morale of Japanese civilians, with it and the other firebombing raids in March convincing most that the war situation was worse than their government had admitted. The Japanese Government responded with a combination of repression, including heavy penalties for people accused of disloyalty or spreading rumors, and a propaganda campaign focused on restoring confidence in the country's air and civil defense measures. These measures were generally unsuccessful.
Few steps were taken to improve Tokyo's defenses after the raid. The majority of the 10th Air Division's senior officers were sacked or reassigned as punishment for the unit's failure on 10 March. Only 20 aircraft were sent to Tokyo to reinforce the 10th Air Division, and these were transferred elsewhere two weeks later when no further attacks were made against the capital. From April, the Japanese reduced their attempts to intercept Allied air raids to preserve aircraft to contest the expected invasion of Japan. The 1st Antiaircraft Division remained active until the end of the war in August 1945. The Japanese military never developed adequate defenses against night air raids, with the night fighter force remaining ineffective and many cities not being protected by antiaircraft guns.
Between April and mid-May XXI Bomber Command mainly focused on attacking airfields in southern Japan in support of the invasion of Okinawa. From 11 May until the end of the war the B-29s conducted day precision bombing attacks when weather conditions were favorable, and night firebombing raids against cities at all other times. Further incendiary attacks were conducted against Tokyo, with the final taking place on the night of 25/26 May. By this time, 50.8 percent of the city had been destroyed and more than 4million people left homeless. Further heavy bomber raids against Tokyo were judged to not be worthwhile, and it was removed from XXI Bomber Command's target list. By the end of the war, 75 percent of the sorties conducted by XXI Bomber Command had been part of firebombing operations.
Remembrance.
Following the war the bodies which had been buried in mass graves were exhumed and cremated. The ashes were interred in a charnel house located in Sumida's Yokoamicho Park which had originally been established to hold the remains of 58,000 victims of the 1923 earthquake. A Buddhist service has been conducted to mark the anniversary of the raid on 10 March each year since 1951. A number of small neighborhood memorials were also established across the affected area in the years after the raid. 10 March was designated Tokyo Peace Day by the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly in 1990.
Few other memorials were erected to commemorate the attack in the decades after the war. Efforts began in the 1970s to construct an official Tokyo Peace Museum to mark the raid, but the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly canceled the project in 1999. Instead, the Dwelling of Remembrance memorial to civilians killed in the raid was built in Yokoamicho Park. This memorial was dedicated in March 2001. The citizens who had been most active in campaigning for the Tokyo Peace Museum established the privately funded Center of the Tokyo Raids and War Damage, which opened in 2002. As of 2015, this center was the main repository of information in Japan about the firebombing raids. A small section of the Edo-Tokyo Museum also covers the air raids on Tokyo. The academic Cary Karacas has stated that a reason for the low-profile official commemoration of the attack in Japan is that the government does not want to acknowledge "that it was Japan who initiated the first-ever air raids on Asia’s cities". Karacas argues that the Japanese Government prefers to focus on the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as commemoration of these attacks "reinforces the Japanese-as-victim stereotype".
In 2007 a group of survivors of the 10 March raid and bereaved families launched a lawsuit seeking compensation and an apology for the Japanese Government's actions regarding the attack. As part of the case, it was argued that the raid had been a war crime and the Japanese Government had acted wrongly by agreeing to elements of the 1951 Treaty of San Francisco which waived the right to seek compensation for such actions from the US Government. The plaintiffs also claimed that the Japanese Government had violated the post-war constitution by compensating the military victims of the raid and their families, but not civilians. The Japanese Government argued that it did not have an obligation to compensate the victims of air raids. In 2009 the Tokyo District Court found in favor of the government. Since that time, a public campaign has advocated for the Japanese Government to pass legislation to provide compensation to civilian survivors of the raid.
Historiography.
Many historians have stated that the 10 March raid on Tokyo was a military success for the United States, and marked the start of the most effective period of air raids on Japan. For instance, the USAAF official history judged that the attack fully met LeMay's objectives, and it and the subsequent firebombing raids shortened the war. More recently, Tami Davis Biddle noted in "The Cambridge History of the Second World War" that "the Tokyo raid marked a dramatic turn in the American air campaign in the Far East; following on the heels of many months of frustration, it loosed the full weight of American industrial might on the faltering Japanese". Mark Lardas has written that 10 March operation was only the second genuinely successful raid on Japan (after an attack against an aircraft factory on 19 January), and "LeMay's decision to switch from precision bombardment to area incendiary missions and to conduct the incendiary missions from low altitudes" was the most important factor in the eventual success of the strategic bombing campaign.
Historians have also discussed the significance of the raid in the USAAF's transition from an emphasis on precision bombing to area bombing. Conrad C. Crane has observed that "the resort to fire raids marked another stage in the escalation towards total war and represented the culmination of trends begun in the air war against Germany". Kenneth P. Werrell noted that the firebombing of Japanese cities and the atomic bomb attacks "have come to epitomize the strategic bombing campaign against Japan. All else, some say, is a prelude or tangential". Historians such as Biddle, William W. Ralph and Barrett Tillman have argued that the decision to change to firebombing tactics was motivated by Arnold and LeMay's desire to prove that the B-29s were effective, and that a strategic bombing force could be a war-winning military arm. British historian Max Hastings shares this view, and has written that the circumstances in which XXI Bomber Command shifted to area attacks in 1945 mirrored those which led Bomber Command to do the same from 1942.
Like the bombing of Dresden, the bombing of Tokyo on 10 March 1945 is used as an example by historians and commentators who criticize the ethics and practices of the Allied strategic bombing campaigns. Concerns initially raised regarding these two raids in the years after World War II have over time evolved into widely-held doubts over the morality and effectiveness of the campaigns. For instance, Selden argues that the attack on Tokyo marked the beginning of an American "approach to warfare that targets entire populations for annihilation". As part of his general critique of Allied area bombing raids on German and Japanese cities, the philosopher A. C. Grayling judged that the 10 March raid was "unnecessary and disproportionate". Some commentators believe that racism motivated the decision to use firebombing tactics, in contrast to the USAAF's greater emphasis on precision bombing in its air campaign against Germany. Werrell has written that while racism may have influenced this, "many other factors were involved, which, I would submit, were more significant". Frank has reached similar conclusions. He also argues that the USAAF would have used firebombing tactics in Europe had German cities been as vulnerable to fire as Japanese cities were and intelligence on the German war economy been as lacking as it was on the Japanese war production facilities. Tillman has written that area bombing was the only viable tactic available to the USAAF at the time given the failure of the precision bombing campaign.
After the bombing, Emperor Hirohito toured the destroyed portions on 18 March. Historians' views of the effects of this experience on him differ. F.J. Bradley states that the visit convinced Hirohito that Japan had lost the war. Tillman has written that the raid had no effect on the Emperor, and Frank argues that Hirohito supported continuing the war until mid-1945.

Bazin River

The Bazin River is a river in Quebec, Canada, that flows from the La Tuque area of the La Tuque administrative authority of Mauricie to the Gatineau River in the unorganized territory of Lac-Oscar, in the Regional County Municipality (RCM) of Antoine-Labelle, in Laurentides (administrative region).
Toponymy.
The Bazin River flows through the canton of Bazin. This toponym evokes the memory of the French writer René Bazin (Angers, France 1853 - Paris, 1932). In the spring of 1912, Bazin arrived in Quebec as part of the Champlain Mission. He continued his stay in Quebec for the participation in the first congress of the French language in Canada which took place in June 1912. Bazin discovers the architectural beauty of Quebec City, overlooking "The most beautiful water crossroads of the world. The writer pays tribute to the rural population of the province.
In an article on September 1st, 1912, published by the "Revue des Deux Mondes", Bazin will tell the story of his trip to Quebec (city). As early as 1884, Bazin had treated Canada in his novel "Aunt Giron". In 1910, in a book called "La Douce France", Bazin tries to excite the nationalist fiber of young French people. His work was widely read in Canada-French, especially in the classical colleges of the time.
The name "Bazin River" has been on map documents since 1929. Previously, the river was known as the "Gatineau North East River" (1908) or simply "Gatineau River" (1914).
The place name Bazin River was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Bank of Place Names of the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

Rusticelia gens

The gens Rusticelia, occasionally spelled Rusticellia, was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. Hardly any members of this gens are mentioned in ancient writers, but a number are known from inscriptions.
Origin.
The nomen "Rusticelius" belongs to a class of gentilicia formed from cognomina ending in the diminutive suffixes "-illus" and "-ellus". It appears to be derived from "rusticellus", clownish, probably a diminutive of "rusticus", rural or unsophisticated, rustic.
Praenomina.
The chief praenomina of the Rusticelii were "Gaius", "Lucius", "Aulus", and "Quintus", all of which were very common throughout Roman history. Other praenomina are found infrequently, including "Marcus" and "Publius", otherwise common names.
Branches and cognomina.
The Rusticelii bore a variety of surnames in imperial times, most of which seem to have been personal cognomina. A number of Rusticelii lived at Ostia, Rome's ancient seaport, where several of them bore the surname "Felix", fortunate or happy.

Galina Petrova

Galina Petrova (; 9 September 1920 – 4 December 1943) was a medic and Chief Petty Officer in the 386th Independent Naval Infantry Battalion of the Black Sea Fleet during the Second World War. She died during a bombing attack on 4 December 1943 less than a month after she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin on 17 November 1943 for her bravery in the Kerch-Eltigen operation.
Early life.
Petrova was born on 9 September 1920 to a Russian family in Nikolaev, Ukraine in the Soviet Union. In 1940 after she graduated from secondary school with honors she entered the Forestry Department of the Novocherkassk Engineering Institute in Rostov. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union she entered nursing courses in Krasnodar.
Military career.
After graduating nursing courses Petrova entered the Soviet Navy as a nurse in 1942. She was present in the Kerch-Eltigen operation in 1943 with the rest of the Black Sea Fleet. On the night of 1 November she carried over twenty wounded soldiers from the battlefield in the night under the cover of darkness, running through a field of barbed wire and mines to reach numerous injured marines. For her bravery in the offensive she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union in November by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Less than a month after she received the award she was injured while holding back German soldiers in a series of following counterattacks in Eltigen on 3 December. She was taken to a hospital for her injuries but died the next day when the school building used as a hospital was bombed. Her remains were interred in the village of heroes in Crimea.
Recognition.
There are memorial plaques dedicated to her memory in Novocherkassk and South Russian State Polytechnic University as well as streets named in her honor in Sevastopol, Tuapse, Nikolaev, and the village of heroes in Kerch. Monuments in her likeness are present at the forestry institute where she studied and at the medical school in Kerch named after her.

The Manfred Mann Album

The Manfred Mann Album is the debut American studio album by Manfred Mann, released in September 1964 on Ascot Records. It contains the hit single "Do Wah Diddy Diddy", as well as covers of well-known R&amp;B hits such as "Smokestack Lightning" by Howlin' Wolf, "I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man" by Muddy Waters, and "Down the Road Apiece" by Will Bradley. Modern reviews of the album are generally positive and consider "The Manfred Mann Album" an important piece during the heydey of the British Invasion.
Background.
The twelve tracks on the record include the group's hit single "Do Wah Diddy Diddy", which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while the rest reflect on their love of R&amp;B, including cover versions of Howlin' Wolf's "Smokestack Lightning", Muddy Waters' "Got My Mojo Working", and Bo Diddley's "Bring It to Jerome". The album includes the Cannonball Adderley song "Sack O' Woe".
Eleven of the twelve tracks were taken from Manfred Mann's debut British release, "The Five Faces of Manfred Mann".
Reception.
In his retrospective review of the release, Richie Unterberger for AllMusic wrote “Manfred Mann's debut full-length U.S. platter was probably their strongest, and indeed one of the stronger British Invasion albums of the very competitive year of 1964. Besides the smash "Do Wah Diddy Diddy," it contained a number of fine soul and R&amp;B covers. Standouts were the versions of "Untie Me" and Ike &amp; Tina Turner's "It's Gonna Work Out Fine," as well as the strong pounding Paul Jones original, "Without You."
Track listing.
All credits adapted from the original releases.
Recording sessions.
All of the songs were recorded 17 December 1963 – 22 June 1964 at EMI Studios, London, England:

I Know That Name is the twelfth solo studio album by the English singer-songwriter Paul Carrack. It was originally released in 2008 on Carrack's own Carrack-UK label.
A reissue billed as the "Ultimate Version" was released in 2014. This reissue featured two additional tracks, replaced six tracks with newly remixed versions, and altered the running order.
Carrack originally recorded the song "Eyes Of Blue" on his 1996 album "Blue Views". The version on "I Know That Name" is an entirely new recording.
Reception.
AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine opines: ""I Know That Name" glides by on a mellow, soulful groove ... It's easy-rolling and even-handed, offering no surprises but plenty of comfort if you've ever been a fan of any of Carrack's work over the years."
William Pinfold of Record Collector notes that "I Know That Name" "should further bolster [Carrack's] reputation as a first-rate singer, songwriter and keyboardist...an album of mature, well-performed modern soul and soft rock."

Yi Yungao

Yi Yungao (; born Wenjiang District, Sichuan in 1951), also known as Wan Ko Yee (the Cantonese version of his name using Western name order) and His Holiness Dorje Chang Buddha III (第三世多杰羌佛) is a Chinese-American artist, Buddhist religious leader and self-declared third reincarnation of Dorje Chang (Vajradhara), a claim not universally accepted and doubted by many Buddhists.
He has many wealthy followers in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand and China. In 1999, he moved to the United States and now lives with his family in Pasadena, California. In addition to his Vajradhara claim, Yi also says that he is the second reincarnation of Vimalakirti and has performed miracles.
Art.
In March 2015, "Ink Lotus", a painting by Yi, sold for $16.5 million at public auction. In 2012, two paintings by Yi sold for $230,000 and $330,000. Greg Brown, an art appraiser with an emphasis in Asian art, expressed puzzlement at the sudden increase in value of works by Yi. Greg Brown was quoted by "LAist" as suggesting that followers of Yi were purchasing his art. A spokesman for Yi said that profits from sale of Yi's artwork were donated to charity.
In 2011, the International Art Museum of America opened in San Francisco, California. It originally only featured works by Yi. There is also a H.H. Dorje Chang Buddha III Cultural and Art Museum in Covina, California, whose mission is "to promote the superb accomplishments of an American with outstanding talent, H.H. Dorje Chang Buddha III, by displaying His achievements in culture, literature, philosophy, art, science, technology, and other fields."
Awards and lobbying.
He has been praised by several United States politicians, including the late Congressman Tom Lantos and Los Angeles County supervisors Hilda Solis and Michael D. Antonovich. Congresswoman Judy Chu presented a certificate to Yi in the past, but has said that she is "deeply disappointed" that the certificate "given under a different name and different circumstances [to Yi], is being used to mislead people." In June 2011 former Congressman Lester L. Wolff presented Yi and former Congressman Ben Gilman with the World Peace Prize. According to public records, Yi's followers have spent $120,000 lobbying members of Congress to pass resolutions honoring Yi and his family. In 2008, the International Buddhism Sangha Association paid lobbyist Robin Raphel $10,000 to arrange for Congresswoman Corrine Brown to introduce a resolution recognizing Yi as the "true incarnation of the primordial Buddha".
Chinese government.
The Chinese government has said that Yi is wanted for fraud, to the value of 60.8 million renminbi. A warrant was issued by Interpol for Yi's arrest, which was withdrawn in 2008. According to a spokesman for Yi, both people who have accused him of fraud have withdrawn their claims. Peter Schey of the Center for Human Rights &amp; Constitutional Law, who acted as Yi's lawyer, has stated the Chinese government levelled the charges against Yi for political reasons. On September 10 2013, police in Changchun, Jilin, suspended an "illegal" religious gathering of over 100 people whose visiting preacher was affiliated with Yi.

In 1978, he entered The College of the Resurrection, Mirfield, an Anglo-Catholic theological college, to train for Holy Orders and study theology. Following his studies, he graduated from the University of Oxford with a further first class BA degree. He left theological college in 1981 to be ordained. He later undertook postgraduate research at New College, Oxford: he completed his Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree in 1990 with a thesis titled "The sinlessness of Christ as a problem in modern systematic theology".
Ordained ministry.
Sheehy was ordained in the Church of England as a deacon in 1981 and as a priest in 1982. From 1981 to 1983, he served his curacy at St Barnabas' Church, Erdington in the Diocese of Birmingham. From 1983 to 1984, he served a further curacy at St Gregory the Great's Church, Small Heath. In 1984, he left the Diocese of Birmingham to return to the University of Oxford where he had been appointed Dean of Divinity, Chaplain, and Fellow of New College, Oxford. While at New College, he worked to increase chapel attendance and also taught law and theology. In 1990, he returned to parish ministry having been appointed Vicar of the Church of St Margaret with St Columba, Leytonstone in the Diocese of Chelmsford. He was additionally appointed priest-in-charge of nearby St Andrew's Church, Leytonstone in 1993. 
In 1996, Sheehy once more returned to Oxford having been appointed Principal of St Stephen's House, Oxford in succession to Edwin Barnes. St Stephen's House is an Anglo-Catholic theological college and a Permanent Private Hall of the University of Oxford. He also served as Chair of the Oxford Partnership for Theological Education and Training (OPTET) between 1999 and 2001: the OPTET consists of the numerous theological colleges and halls in and surrounding Oxford.
In 2006, after ten years heading a theologian college, Sheehy was appointed Team Rector of St Peter's Church, Swinton and Pendlebury in the Diocese of Manchester. The benefice receives alternative episcopal oversight from the Bishop of Beverley. Since 2008, he has also been an examining chaplain to the Bishop of Manchester and teaches doctrine at the All Saints Centre for Mission and Ministry, a part-time training course covering the North-West, Isle of Man and East Midlands. From 2011 to 2013, he was additionally the Area Dean of Eccles.
Views.
Sheehy belongs to the traditionalist Catholic tradition of the Church of England. As such, he rejects the ordination of women and supports the traditional definition of marriage (of one man and one woman). He is Regional Vicar for the North of England and Scotland Region of the Society of the Holy Cross (SSC).
Honours.
In 2004, Sheehy was awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity (DDhc) by the Graduate Theological Foundation. In 2009, he was awarded a DDhc degree by Nashotah House in Wisconsin.

Herbert A. Wilson

Herbert A. Wilson (November 27, 1870–May 7, 1934) was an American politician who served as Commissioner of the Boston Police Department and member of the Massachusetts General Court.
Early life.
Wilson was born on November 27, 1870 in Boston's Brighton neighborhood. He graduated from Brighton High School and studied civil engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He spent many years as an assistant engineer for the city of Boston. In 1908 he began working at the office of John Cheney, a bridge builder. Wilson eventually started his own engineering business.
Political career.
From 1913 to 1916, Wilson was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. From 1917 to 1918 he represented the Norfolk and Suffolk District in the Massachusetts Senate. On July 18, 1918 he was appointed by Boston Mayor Andrew James Peters to serve as the city's Building Commissioner. On April 3, 1922 Wilson was appointed by Governor Channing H. Cox to succeed the deceased Edwin Upton Curtis as Boston's police commissioner. He was reappointed by Governor Alvan T. Fuller in 1927. During his later years as commissioner, Wilson fought with Mayor James Michael Curley and District Attorney William J. Foley, who believed that there was a great deal of corruption in city government. In 1930, the head of BPD's liquor and vice raiding squad, Oliver Garrett, was convicted on conspiracy charges. Massachusetts Attorney General Joseph E. Warner found that Wilson had not taken part in any corruption, but faulted him for not discovering the corruption, negligence, and incompetency within his department and for awarding Garrett a fraudulent pension. Governor Frank G. Allen demanded Wilson's resignation, but he refused to quit. On May 5, 1930, the Massachusetts Governor's Council voted unanimously to remove Wilson "for the better protection of the public welfare".
Later life.
After his departure from the police department, Wilson resumed his engineering practice. He died on May 7, 1934 at his home in Brighton, Boston following several weeks of illness.

Jean Joseph Valéry

Count Jean Joseph Valéry (1828 – 26 March 1879) was a French shipowner and politician who was Senator of Corsica in 1876–79. He inherited a line of steamships for passenger, cargo and mail services that he greatly expanded to operate between southern France, Corsica, Italy, Spain and Algeria. Later the company ran into difficulty with growing competition, and after his death the ships were sold off.
Background.
Joseph Valéry was born in 1828 in Bastia, Corsica.
His father was Jean-Mathieu Valéry.
The Compagnie Valery frères was founded on 9 November 1840 in Bastia by the brothers Jean-Mathieu and Joseph Valéry.
The brothers were from Poretta-Brando, from a family of sailors of Cap Corse.
They established the first line served by a steamship between Bastia, Corsica, and Livorno, then in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.
In 1843 the limited company Joseph et Frères Valéry was founded with five ships: "Télégraph", "Golo", "Ambassadeur Pozzo di Borgo", "Maréchal Sebastiani" and "Letizia".
The company offered two return trips per week from Marseille to Bastia and Marseille to Ajaccio.
In 1845 the Compagnie Valéry placed an order with the shipyard of La Ciotat for the steamship "Bonaparte", an innovative design with an iron hull and a propeller.
Construction started that year, but was long and difficult.
The "Bonaparte" was launched on 17 January 1847.
The trials gave excellent results, with much lower fuel consumption per horsepower per hour than paddle boats.
On 19 October 1847 the "Bonaparte" collided with the "Comte de Paris" during the night and sank.
Between 1840 and 1883 forty-six ships flew the flag of the Compagnie Valéry.
In 1850 Valery Freres took over the dispatch service abandoned by the French government's postal packet boats.
Shipowner.
Jean-Mathieu Valéry died in 1854 and Jean Joseph Valéry became the partner of his uncle Joseph.
The company became the Compagnie Maritime Valery Frères &amp; Fils.
The company provided postal service between Marseille and Corsica.
In 1856 Valéry was named president of the Bastia Chamber of Commerce.
In 1856 the fleet was enlarged with the addition of the "Ajaccio", "Bastia", "Progrès", "Industrie", "Louise", "Jean-Mathieu", "Insulaire" and "Générale Abbatucci".
The 150 horsepower / ship "Roi Jérôme" was built for the company in 1861 in Scotland.
It was renamed the "Comte Joseph Valery" in 1877.
Valéry married Hortense Piccioni. 
Their daughter Marie Antoinette Valéry (c. 1858–1940) married Jean Casimir de Galard de Brassac de Béarn (1852–1910).
In 1861 the elder Joseph Valéry died and his nephew Joseph became the sole manager of the Compagnie des Paquebots de la Méditerranée.
Joseph Valéry established himself in Paris as one of the leaders of French maritime trade.
He became master of the Grand Orient de France Freemason lodge "la parfaite harmonie française" in Bastia.
He was made a papal count by Pope Pius IX.
Under Valéry the fleet expanded from 12 to 33 ships, and the capital from 120,000 to 12 million francs.
The company provided cabotage service to the Corsican ports, operated lines between Corsica and Marseile, Nice, Toulon and Sardinia as well as links from Marseille to Tunisia, Algeria and Spain.
Valery used his wealth to build a splendid mansion in Bastia, demolished in the 1950s.
An agreement was made on 10 July 1862 between Valéry and Édouard Vandal(), Director General of Posts, for the company to run a weekly postal service between Nice and alternately Ajaccio and Bastia.
An imperial decree of 25 April 1863 conformed this postal service concession.
The fleet was also granted the concession by the Italian state to provide the postal service between Genoa, Italy and Sicily, although all the ships flew the French flag.
After 18 years of monopoly, in 1868 the Compagnie Fraissinet became a competitor.
On 11 June 1870 Valéry's company won the concession for postal service and transport between France and Algeria, and on the eastern part of the Algerian coast.
After the fall of the Second French Empire in 1870 François Morelli became director of food and restaurants for Valéry's company.
He became one of Valéry's main partners.
In 1873 the company lost the Corsican postal service concession to the Fraissinet company.
Politician.
Valéry was a general councilor for Bastia.
He served as vice-consul of Spain, Austria and Greece and consul of Portugal.
He was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour, and received many foreign decorations.
Valéry was also the Bonapartist general councillor for the canton of Brando from 1871 to 1879.
Valéry was elected Senator of Corsica on 30 January 1876 by 288 votes out of 476.
During his campaign he was given strong support by Eugène Rouher, Denis Gavini and Jean-Charles Abbatucci.
His election was validated despite the fact that he had given senatorial electors free transport and food on one of his boats, from where they went under escort to vote.
In the senate he sat with the Bonapartist Appel au peuple group.
He voted for the dissolution of the chamber demanded by the ministry of de Broglie.
After Valéry was elected a senator his company was poorly managed.
Due to bad health he had to spend the winter in Florence, where he died on 26 March 1879.
He was aged 58.
Legacy.
On 22 June 1879 Valéry was replaced in the senate by Joseph Marie Piétri.
Morelli became president of the company.
Valéry's son and heir Jean-Mathieu squandered the company's capital recklessly.
In 1878 the company had 27 steamboats.
12 of these were sold by a private deed of 6 December 1880 to the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique to clear a bond debt.
By 1883 the company was ruined and Jean-Mathieu Valéry went into exile in Venezuela.
The Valéry family abandoned its business and in March 1883 sold the remaining 11 ships of its fleet to a company organized by Morelli with other Corsican capitalists to fight the Compagnie Fraissinet hegemony on Corsica.
Valery's tomb, in Carrara marble is in a mausoleum a few hundred yards from the village of Erbalunga, near the Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel chapel.

20th Fighter Wing

The 20th Fighter Wing (20 FW) is a wing of the United States Air Force and the host unit at Shaw Air Force Base South Carolina. The wing is assigned to Air Combat Command's Fifteenth Air Force.
The wing's mission is to provide, project, and sustain combat-ready aircraft in conventional and anti-radiation suppression of enemy air defenses, strategic attack, counter-air, air interdiction, joint maritime operations and combat search-and-rescue missions.
History.
The 20th Fighter Wing was established on 20 July 1947 at Shaw Field, South Carolina and activated on 15 August. Upon its activation, the 20th commanded the functions of both the support groups as well as the flying 20th Fighter Group and the squadrons assigned to it. On 26 August 1948, the wing's 20th Airdrome Group was discontinued and its elements became realigned under the 20th Air Base Group.
On 15 December 1993, the flight line at RAF Upper Heyford was closed. The wing moved without personnel and equipment from the UK to South Carolina on 1 January 1994, inheriting the personnel and equipment of the 363d Fighter Wing.
Two F-16s from the wing collided during a training flight on 15 October 2009. One F-16, piloted by Captain Lee Bryant, was able to land safely at Shaw. The other plane, piloted by Captain Nicholas Giglio, 32, apparently crashed into the ocean. Authorities believe that Giglio was killed instantly in the collision and did not eject. An accident investigation board determined that the crash was caused by pilot error. The board stated that Giglio was flying too fast and was not paying adequate attention as he attempted to rejoin Bryant's aircraft for the return flight to Shaw.
Units.
The 20th Fighter Wing is composed of four groups each with specific functions. The Operations Group controls all flying and airfield operations. The Maintenance Group performs maintenance of aircraft, ground equipment and aircraft components. The Mission Support Group has a wide range of responsibilities,a few of its functions are Security, Civil Engineering, Communications, Personnel Management, Logistics, Services and Contracting support. While the Medical Group provides medical and dental care.
Additionally, the 20th Comptroller Squadron reports directly to the wing commander.

John S. Trower

John S. Trower (1849-1911) was an American businessman. He was among the wealthiest African Americans in Pennsylvania and possibly the United States at the time of his death.
Early life and career.
Trower was born on October 3, 1849, in Eastville, Northampton County, Virginia. His parents, Luke and Anna M. Trower, were free black farmers and of mixed white, Native American and African American descent.
From age 16 to 21, Trower worked on the farm with his family, saving all that he could. All through his early life young Trower was hobbled with the necessity of servicing his family's debt. By the time he was 21 he had saved enough to lift this burden from his family and he felt free to go in search of a fortune. He presented his mother with the deed of the farm and bade her goodbye. At that time, the tide of immigration had already set in from the Virginia plantations toward the cities and young Trower drifted with it in the direction of Baltimore. There was $52 surplus after the farm was paid for and with this sum Trower, wholly inexperienced in the difficulties and dangers of city life, landed in Baltimore.
Trower was fortunate there in meeting the Mack family, with whom he made his home during the larger part of the time that he was in Baltimore. They gave him advice which proved of great value to him in his later life. While he was in Baltimore he obtained work in a restaurant as an oyster-opener and soon began, in spite of the small salary he received there, to accumulate a small capital. Partly because he believed he could better his condition in a Northern city and partly led by mere desire to see more of the world, he determined in 1870 to leave Baltimore and go to Philadelphia.
Business success.
Trower decided to settle in Germantown, one of the more wealthy and prosperous quarters of the city, and with the little capital that he had gotten together, he opened a restaurant. He found a modest place in Chelton Avenue in the neighborhood of the Philadelphia and Reading depot. This business seems to have prospered from the beginning. Very soon, Trower was doing, in addition to his restaurant business, a very respectable trade as a caterer. He won the favor of the fashionable people of Germantown and his increasing trade forced him rapidly into a larger and more lucrative business.
Within two blocks of his restaurant stood the old Germantown Savings Fund building. Fortunately for Trower, this building was left vacant at this time, the bank having just completed a new building into which it established itself. There was a demand for a first-class caterer's establishment in Germantown. Trower had succeeded in winning the goodwill of some of the wealthy citizens and, with their encouragement, he purchased and refitted the Savings Fund building and made out of it, at a cost of $25,000, a first-class caterer's establishment. He was now fairly on his feet in a business way and began to make money rapidly. It was at this time that he made the acquaintance and won the goodwill of some of the officers of William Cramp &amp; Sons, a shipbuilding company. Soon after this, in 1889, Trower had his first opportunity to cater for the Cramps. The firm employed him steadily after that time. Many of the world's most renowned war vessels were served upon their trial trips by Trower, among them the Yorktown, the Philadelphia, the Vesuvius, the New York, the Iowa, the Columbia, the Baltimore, the Minneapolis, the Newark, the Brooklyn, the Variag, the Retvizan, the Mecidiye, the Colorado and the Pennsylvania.
Trower's place of business was one of the most complete of its kind in the country. On the first floor were his offices, dining-room, delivery department and ice cream plant, which was run by electricity. On the second floor was a reception-room and a dining hall, which seated 150 guests, and the baking department. On the third floor were the storeroom and laundry. In the basement were china closets and storage-rooms. In his office he employed five clerks, all of whom were young African American men and women. The culinary, ice cream, baking, and delivery service departments employed 20 people. A large element of Trower's success must be attributed to the fact that he constantly sought to improve and extend his business. His trade was not limited to Germantown and Philadelphia, but extended throughout the state. On several occasions he served large orders in the South and West. At the time when John Wanamaker, of Philadelphia, was Postmaster General, Trower served him as caterer in a reception which was at that time one of the most elaborate that had ever been given in Washington, D.C.
In addition to his caterer's trade he did a lucrative real estate business. He owned considerable property both in Germantown and Ocean City, New Jersey, where he had his summer residence.
Personal life.
Outside of his business, Trower was a member of the well known Cherry Street Baptist Church. He was a member of the board of deacons, and of the board of trustees, and superintendent of the Sunday school. The National Baptist Convention made him the National Baptist Superintendent of the World. He was the President of the Sunday School Convention of Pennsylvania, a position he held for many years. Trower contributed greatly to the building up of a number of Baptist churches of his city and state. His advice was frequently sought in matters of finance and church policy in the Baptist denomination. He was president of the Cherry Building and Loan Society, treasurer of the Reliable Mutual Aid and Improvement Company, and treasurer of the Reliable Business Men's Building. He was a member of the board of trustees for the Home for Aged and Infirm Colored People, and member of the board of trustees for the Olive Cemetery. As president of the Pennsylvania Sunday School Convention, it was he who suggested the necessity of the establishment of an Industrial and Theological School in Pennsylvania. He purchased a farm in Downingtown, Pennsylvania, and held it in trust until the Baptists of the state were enabled to assume the responsibility of the purchase. Trower was also very active in charitable work.
Trower's wife was Miss Matilda Daniels, of Haymarket, Virginia. Matilda Trower took an active part in the business as well as rearing a family of six children.
Death.
Trower died in Philadelphia on April 4, 1911, at the age of 61. His reputed wealth of approximately $1 million placed him among the richest African Americans in Pennsylvania and possibly the United States.

L'Union Saint Jean-Baptist d'Amerique (Woonsocket, Rhode Island)

The L'Union Saint Jean-Baptiste d'Amerique is a historic building at 1 Social Street in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. Built in 1926, it housed a fraternal benefit society for French Canadian Roman Catholic immigrants for many years, serving a significant immigrant population in the community. The building is also a prominent example of Classical Revival architecture, designed by a French Canadian immigrant architect, Walter Fontaine. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.
Description and history.
The L'Union Saint Jean-Baptist d'Amerique building occupies a prominent site at the northern end of Woonsocket's Monument Square, at the southern corner of Social and Worrall Streets. It is a four-story masonry structure, built mainly out of brick but with a limestone facade. The facade faces west toward Social Street and Monument Square, and is dominated by monumental Corinthian columns and pilasters that rise from the second floor to an entablature beneath the projecting cornice. It is eight bays wide, with the outermost bays housing single sash windows, and the inner ones consisting of paired sash windows recessed between the columns. Panels of garlanded stone separate the windows in the inner bays. The ground-floor storefronts have a modern exterior, which has been applied over the original pressed metal storefronts.
L'Union Saint-Jean-Baptiste d’Amerique (USJB) was founded in 1900 to serve a burgeoning French Canadian immigrant population in New England and the United States, drawn by the prospect of employment in the many textile mills. In Woonsocket, for example, by 1900 fully 60% of the city's population was of French Canadian extraction, and by 1920 it was among the most French cities in the country. The USJB was a national organization which provided a support network for French Canadians, particularly supporting the continuation of French Canadian language and culture; its official language was French, and its membership was required to be Roman Catholic. The organization was originally headquartered in a building on Clinton Street, and had this building erected as its headquarters in 1926. It maintained its headquarters here until 1991, when it merged with Catholic Family Life Insurance.

Hanapēpē River

The Hanapepe River is a river on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It begins at the confluence of the Kō'ula River with the Manuahi Stream and flows generally south for to its mouth at Hanapepe and Eleele in the Pacific Ocean. The watershed covers an area of 27.7 square miles, draining roughly a twentieth of the island. The name Hanapepe translates to "crushed bay," which may refer to landslides in the area.
The river drains the fertile Hanapepe Valley, a region that was historically used for growing rice, taro, coffee, and sugarcane. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the valley attracted Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Filipino immigrant workers, many of whom started their own farms or businesses. More recently, the Hanapepe Valley was used for filming parts of the 1993 Steven Spielberg film "Jurassic Park".
Near its mouth in Hanapepe, the river passes under the Hanapepe Swinging Bridge. The footbridge was built in 1911 to provide Hanapepe residents with a way to cross the river, and was restored in 1992 after Hurricane Iniki. Considered a local tourist attraction, the bridge is popular with children due to its tendency to rock back and forth.

Kyle Kashuv

Kyle Kashuv (born May 20, 2001) is an American conservative activist. He survived the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and subsequently advocated for gun rights, notably in opposition to his fellow survivors' March for Our Lives movement. 
Shooting aftermath and activism.
On February 14, 2018, Kashuv hid in a closet near the building where the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting occurred. He was 16 years old, attending his junior year. He later petitioned President Donald Trump to award Peter Wang, a student who had helped several others escape before he was killed, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
In April 2018, Kashuv said he was questioned and intimidated by a Broward County officer and a school security officer after he posted a photo of himself posing at a shooting range with an AR-15 rifle, on his Twitter account. Kashuv explained that he wanted to learn the "physical mechanics" of guns and how to defend himself, as well as to "show people it's people that are the issue, not guns." Marjory Stoneman Douglas High history teacher Greg Pittman said the gesture was in poor taste, which Kashuv denied. He said other students told him that Pittman called him the "next Hitler" while discussing the photo.
Kashuv is a supporter of the Republican Party. He supported Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election, endorsing Trump's ideas about immigration, the Trump wall, and Trump's "America First" approach. Kashuv was initially guided by conservative commentators Ben Shapiro and Guy Benson. Kashuv has also worked for Ron DeSantis' campaign for the 2018 Florida gubernatorial election. By March 2018, Kashuv was in the process of producing a mobile phone application, ReachOut, which aims to let students who have emotional struggles to ask for help. In April 2018, Kashuv criticized CNN for being biased because one of their contributors, Joan Walsh, had liked a tweet by Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter died in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. In July 2018, Kashuv gave a speech at the 2018 National Western Conservative Summit. Kashuv also gave a speech in April 2019 at the yearly meeting of the National Rifle Association (NRA).
The "Miami Herald" in July 2018 wrote that the conservative Second Amendment supporter Kashuv had "gained a national following as a counterweight to the March For Our Lives" movement. Associated Press in February 2019 described Kashuv as "the most prominent conservative voice among the students" who had survived the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. As of June 2019, Kashuv has amassed over 300,000 followers on Twitter.
Turning Point USA.
Kashuv became director of high school outreach of the conservative group Turning Point USA and gave speeches about gun rights, including at Princeton University. Kashuv invited Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk to address Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, but the school did not permit the activity. Kashuv helped to plan the organization's 2018 High School Leadership Summit for over 800 students, and was lauded by Fox News in July 2018 as "a role model for young conservatives across the country." That month, Kirk described Kashuv as a "a national spokesperson for one of the most controversial and divisive issues of our time," and as "probably the most hated pro-gun advocate at the time besides Dana Loesch," a spokesperson of the NRA.
He resigned from Turning Point in May 2019, hours after former classmates threatened to make public screenshots of racist remarks Kashuv had made. Kashuv denied that his resignation was related to his racist remarks.
Washington, D.C. meetings.
Following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Michael Gruen, a 19-year old "influencer marketer," noticed Kashuv's posts on Twitter and approached him offering to help him get his message out. With the help of conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, and former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, meetings on Capitol Hill were set up for Kashuv in March 2018. The trip was mostly planned on short notice, with Kashuv reacting: "I never really wanted to get into politics." During his visit, Kashuv met with President Trump and his wife Melania Trump, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, two Democratic senators (Chris Murphy and Chuck Schumer), three Republican senators (Orrin Hatch, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz), Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, and CNN's Jim Acosta.
In April 2018, Kashuv met with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and discussed their support for the Second Amendment.
Gun rights views.
Kashuv supports the Second Amendment. Before the mass shooting, Kashuv supported zero gun restrictions, but after the mass shooting, Kashuv changed his position to favor much "stricter background checks and mental evaluations" for gun purchases, but still disagrees with banning any type of gun. He also does not support restrictions on standard capacity magazines. Regarding the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Kashuv did not blame gun laws, instead blaming the failures of law enforcement for failing to either stop the gunman during the shooting, or even identify the gunman as a threat before the shooting happened. Kashuv endorses the idea that "the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun"; he has advocated for schools to eliminate gun-free zones, and for policies allowing teachers and school staff to be armed. Kashuv supports the Senate's bipartisan STOP School Violence Act, which provides federal funds to develop an "anonymous reporting systems for threats of school violence," improve "school security infrastructure," and train students, school staff and law enforcement to prevent violence.
Kashuv said he agrees with fellow student activists David Hogg, Cameron Kasky and X González that gun deaths and school shootings need to be stopped, "and that shouldn't be delegitimized, ever." Kashuv's stated solutions to improve the situation differ from Hogg and Kasky's, but he has called for a debate with them to find "common middle ground." Kashuv has also said he felt frustrated that he was not invited to speak at the March for Our Lives event,&lt;ref name="Tillett_3/25/2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting it was because of his political views. Kashuv has described himself as speaking "calmly and logically" in contrast to "inflammatory language" used by other student activists. Kashuv believed that the "initial movement, in its purest form" coming out of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting "was amazing." He said that "It got corrupted because now it's represented as anti-gun and anti-NRA." He described March for Our Lives as being "anti-Republican" and said that the NRA does not have as much "evil power" over politicians as their critics believe. Kashuv himself was criticized by the students in Never Again MSD for his views on gun rights.
Criticism by Kurt Eichenwald.
In late March 2018, Kashuv was criticized online by "Newsweek" writer Kurt Eichenwald. In response, Kashuv called for a boycott of MSNBC, since Eichenwald had stated that he was an MSNBC contributor on his Twitter biography, although Eichenwald had actually not been an MSNBC contributor since a month prior. One of MSNBC's sponsors, Proactiv, removed its advertisements from the network in response.
Eichenwald apologized to Kashuv, claiming that his criticism of Kashuv was a case of mistaken identity because he had taken Kashuv to be another teenager who had frequently insulted him before. Kashuv accepted Eichenwald's apology.
In April 2018, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro published emails Eichenwald sent to him which included a statement that Kashuv was "in desperate need of psychiatric help." In those emails, Eichenwald stated that he was a contributing editor at "Vanity Fair", but "Vanity Fair" issued a statement saying that Eichenwald was not a contributor at the time.
Personal life.
Kashuv's parents emigrated to the United States from Israel in the 1990s before he was born. He grew up in Parkland, Florida. Kashuv considers himself to be politically conservative. He and his parents are Jewish. In 2019, he said he pays weekly visits to the synagogue.
In April 2018, a student at Lincoln Southeast High School in Lincoln, Nebraska, who admired Kashuv's for expressing views about gun rights contrary to so many of his classmates, asked Kashuv to her prom. Kashuv turned her down until she received more than 5,000 re-tweets of her posting with the help of Ben Shapiro. Kashuv did not have a tuxedo or airplane fare to get to Nebraska, so she set up a GoFundMe account, which raised the necessary money in two hours. Kashuv accompanied her to her prom, and met with Nebraska governor Pete Ricketts.
Controversy.
Several of Kashuv's classmates complained on social media and to the press regarding Kashuv's use of inflammatory and racist comments, including racial slurs against African-Americans. Kashuv was accused by his classmates of hypocrisy when he criticized Bill Nye for using vulgarities in a skit regarding climate change on "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver" (Nye had declared: "The planet's on fucking fire!"), stating that Nye "looked like a joke."
Screenshots of a Google Doc for a class study guide showed Kashuv writing "NIGGER" multiple times, discussing "JEWISH SLAVES," and declaring that he would "fucking make a CSOG map of Douglas and practice" (in a supposed reference to the "" shooter game and Stoneman Douglas High School). Text messages also reportedly showed Kashuv rating a female student "7/10" and stating that she "goes for niggerjocks."
On May 22, 2019, Kashuv released a statement about the screenshots and the comments within, admitting to writing the comments when he was 16 years old before the mass shooting occurred. Kashuv called his comments "offensive," "idiotic" and "inflammatory" and that the mass shooting changed him as a person. In an interview with "The New York Times", Kashuv said that the comments on the Google Doc were made late at night, and that he had "said a bunch of anti-Semitic stuff." On June 17, 2019, Kashuv stated that the comments were made "months before the shooting," and also said that Harvard University had rescinded its offer of admission as a result of the remarks. Kashuv published a letter by Harvard, which stated that they had considered "the qualities of maturity and moral character" in their decision. Kashuv has accused unidentified political opponents of having urged Harvard not to accept him.
Kashuv has said he would have to reapply to other colleges because it was too late to accept other offers. He had originally intended to take a gap year before matriculating into Harvard.

After some investigation, Ryota discovers the mysterious woman Naho (Aoi Miyazaki) to be the daughter of the best friend of her father (the town dentist Tori, (Nishida Toshiyuki), who grew up together. The two shared the love of a girl who they grew up, the mother of Naho.
While staying at the town, Ryota and his daughter begins to find out about its odd ways, in particular, with the town's belief in the local legendary Kuna creatures. After finding a tiny hat apparently belonging to one of the creatures, Ryota becomes fascinated with them, and gets his work involved in a hunt for them.
Ryota and the townspeople finally organise an event based around hunting for the creatures, and Ryota appears to see one. Eisuke dies, and Ryota comes to terms with his problematic relationship with his father.

Parochial Memories of 1758

The Parochial Memories of 1758 () are the results of an enquiry sent to every parish in Portugal following the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, by order of Sebastião de Carvalho e Melo, the Secretary of State of Internal Affairs of the Kingdom. The exercise was organised according to a plan containing sixty written questions; the compiled answers, relaying accounts on not only the damage sustained by the earthquake but also information on the local geography, demography, history, and economy, are valuable historical documents and are stored in the country's National Archive.
Because Secretary Carvalho e Melo (today more commonly known by the title of Marquis of Pombal) was the first to attempt an objective description of the broad causes and consequences of an earthquake, he is regarded as a forerunner of modern seismological scientists. By analysing and cross-referencing the parish priests' accounts, modern scientists are able to reconstruct the event with some degree of scientific precision; without the questionnaire, this would have been impossible.
The questionnaire.
The enquiry was split in three parts: the first, comprised 27 questions about the settlement; the second, 13 questions about the local landforms, specifically mountains; and the third, 20 questions about the local watercourses.
All three parts ended by asking if there was anything else that was worthy of memory, in an effort to collect more information about the parishes' local peculiarities.

Foldereid (municipality)

Foldereid is a former municipality in the northern part of the old Nord-Trøndelag county in Norway. The municipality existed from 1886 until its dissolution in 1964. The municipality encompassed the area surrounding the inner part of the Folda fjord, the "Innerfolda" in what is now the municipalities of Nærøysund and Høylandet in Trøndelag county. The village of Foldereid, where the Foldereid Church is located, was the administrative centre of the municipality.
History.
The municipality of Foldereid was established on 1 October 1886 when it was separated from the large municipality of Kolvereid (municipality). Initially, the new municipality had 948 residents. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Foldereid was dissolved. The eastern Kongsmoen area (population: 221) was merged into the neighboring municipality of Høylandet and the remainder of the municipality (population: 817) was merged into the neighboring municipality of Nærøy.
Government.
All municipalities in Norway, including Foldereid, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor.
Municipal council.
The municipal council of Foldereid was made up of 13 representatives that were elected to four year terms. The party breakdown of the final municipal council was as follows:

In 1860, the northern islands and coastal area of Kolvereid (population: 1,702) was separated to become the new municipality of Leka. Then on 1 October 1886, the northeastern part of the municipality (population: 948) surrounding the innermost parts of the Foldafjord was separated to become the new municipality of Foldereid. This left Kolvereid with 1,716 residents. On 1 January 1902, an unpopulated part of Kolvereid was transferred to the neighboring municipality of Nærøy. 
During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Kolvereid (population: 2,426) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Nærøy (population: 2,182), Gravvik (population: 816), and the western two-thirds of Foldereid to form the new, larger municipality of Nærøy.
Government.
All municipalities in Norway, including Kolvereid, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. 
Municipal council.
The municipal council of Kolvereid was made up of representatives that were elected to four year terms. The party breakdown of the final municipal council was as follows:

Allen Saalburg

Allen Russell Saalburg (1899–1987) was an American painter, illustrator, and screen printer born in Rochelle, Illinois. His father was the cartoonist Charles W. Saalburg. He studied at the Art Students League of New York before working in advertising and magazine illustration in the 1920s. A business trip he took to Paris in 1929 with his wife, sketching runway fashion for department stores, led to his first gallery show, at the esteemed Bernheim-Jeune, with his second in New York at a gallery of Louis Bouché. During the 1930s he had regular shows of screenprints on glass (his specialty) and wall panels, and directed a mural division of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), in New York City, overseeing murals in the Central Park Zoo and other New York locations. His murals in the Arsenal of Central Park survive today. 
In 1942, the United States Flag Association awarded him the Cross of Honor and Patriotic Service Cross for his painting "Flag Over Mt. Vernon". By the 1940s Saalburg had established his own press. He was married to fashion designer Muriel King, and later to Mary Faulconer, a painter. In 1947 after divorce and the loss of his child by his first wife, he moved to Bucks County, Pennsylvania, re-establishing his printing operation as the Canal Press, for the Delaware Canal nearby.
He died in Flemington, New Jersey, at the age of 88. His works can be found in the institutions such as the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Saffaracus of Paris

Saffaracus of Paris was a 6th century French bishop.
Early life.
We know almost nothing of his life, except that he was probably of Frankish origin and before being made Bishop of Paris he was an abbot.
Career.
Saffaracus was present at the Fifth Council of Orléans in 549.
Saffaracus is best known for having been at a council called to dismissed from his ministry. This event is reported by Gregory of Tours, who refers to it without giving any explanation. However, Charles Louandre specifies, that convinced of a capital crime, he was exiled to a monastery where he finished his days. Saffaracus, forgot the duties of his ministry. Accused and convinced by his own confession of a capital crime, in a council summoned to Paris expressly to judge him, he was condemned to be shut up for the rest of his days in a monastery; but this is an exceptional fact. 
This capital crime was probably simony or repeated adultery, as other authors have pointed out.
As for the council or synod in question, it is the Council of Paris, which some fix in 551, while others in 552, but more likely of 553. This council, organized to judge him, was summoned by King Childebert and presided over by the archbishop of Arles, Sapaudus.
Be that as it may, Saffaracus deposed was confined in a monastery and replaced by Eusebius, although Gregory of Tours says Saint Nicet replaced him.

Syrian Revolutionary Left Current

The Syrian Revolutionary Left Current is a leftist political organization that opposes the Ba'athist-led government of Syria. Formed in October 2011, the group supports the uprising against the Syrian government and aims to build a "democratic, civil, and pluralist state" in Syria, while opposing any foreign military intervention in the Syrian Civil War.
Ideology and history.
During the formation of the Syrian Revolutionary Left Current in October 2011, its founding documents stated that it "adopts the major objectives of the Syrian People's Revolution, for freedom, democracy, dignity and social justice, and is committed to engage in mass action to achieve these objectives." It considered that "revolutionary dynamics is about building a democracy from below", and advocated for participatory democracy and direct democracy. The Revolutionary Left Current opposes all forms of foreign military intervention in Syria, including by NATO, by the Arab League, by Israel, and by Turkey.
The Revolutionary Left Current's founding document also outlined a list of goals for the group and for other Syrian opposition groups, which were to overthrow the Syrian government and establish a "Provisional Revolutionary Government", dismantle the "security infrastructure of the state", and election of a Constituent Assembly.
In August 2013, the Syrian Revolutionary Left Current condemned the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the al-Nusra Front, and amid the Syrian Kurdish–Islamist conflict, it "reaffirmed its commitment" to support self-determination for Kurds in Syria. It also condemned the Syrian National Council for refusing to recognize rights for Kurdish people in Syria.
On 23 September 2014, the group condemned the American-led intervention in Syria which began with airstrikes against ISIL, al-Nusra Front, and Ahrar al-Sham in Syria.
In the spring of 2016, the Syrian Revolutionary Left Current and Greek leftist groups opened 6 centers in Athens, housing 2,400 Syrian refugees.
In September 2016, the Syrian Revolutionary Left Current formed an alliance with the Syrian National Democratic Alliance and the Syrian Democratic Forces on the basis of political decentralization and the establishment of a pluralist democracy in Syria. When the Turkish Armed Forces launched a military operation against the SDF in the Afrin Region on 20 January 2018, the Revolutionary Left Current condemned the operation and announced its support for the SDF in Afrin against Turkey. On 1 May 2019 (International Workers' Day), the Syrian Revolutionary Left Current released a statement condemning the "bourgeois regime" of Syria and Turkey, and blaming the collapse of the Syrian Revolution on the absence of a "revolutionary party".
Armed wing: People's Liberation Faction.
Armed members of the Revolutionary Left Current operating in Syria announced themselves in January 2014. On 18 March 2014, three armed and masked militants announced the formation of the People's Liberation Faction as part of the Syrian Revolutionary Left Current. Fighters of the group were armed with Kalashnikov rifles, PK machine guns, and RPG-7s. The group also used a technical, a mortar, and a DShK heavy machine gun. It cooperated with several local Free Syrian Army-affiliated groups.
On 12 April 2014, a unit in the group attempted to redeploy fighters from the Hama Governorate to support other rebel groups in the Battle of Aleppo, when they were stopped at an al-Nusra Front checkpoint. Clashes then ensued and 3 fighters from the People's Liberation Faction were killed.
Fighters of the group redeployed to Kobanî in order to reinforce the city against an ISIL offensive in September 2014.
In late 2014, due to persecution by "counter-revolutionary forces", the People's Liberation Faction largely suspended its activities in Syria. It officially announced its dissolution on 26 January 2015.

Arkansas City High School (Kansas)

Arkansas City High School is a public high school in Arkansas City, Kansas, United States, operated by Arkansas City USD 470. Similar to the nickname for the city, the high school is usually referred to as “Ark City”.
History.
During the early days of many new communities, church buildings were used for multiple purposes until other facilities could be built. On June 4, 1880, the first Arkansas City High School graduating class had its commencement at the First United Methodist Church. The district rented space in a former boarding house owned by H. P. Farrar in the period 1888 to 1891 to use for high school classes. The building got the nickname "Bed Bug Hall" due to the discovery of the pests.
From September 7, 1892 to 1922, high school classes were held in what is now known as Old Arkansas City High School. In 1893 the principal was L. E. Eddy and there were a total of three faculty. Cowley Community College was established in 1922 as the Arkansas City Junior College and, for thirty years, its facilities were in the basement of the Old Arkansas City High School building, one of the oldest remaining buildings in Arkansas City. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as "Old Arkansas City High School" and is Cowley College's Ireland Hall.
In 1922, students moved to a "new" high school.
Athletics.
The first athletic activities were a girls' basketball team organized by chemistry and physics teacher Roxana Oldroyd. In 1906 the boys' basketball team was created.
The tennis team and softball team have won several state championships. Arkansas City native Darren Daulton played fourteen seasons with the Philadelphia Phillies, in one of which they won the 1993 National League pennant, and three with the Florida Marlins, with whom he won the 1997 World Series. He was inducted into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame in 2006. Quarterback Jack Mitchell was an All-American in 1948 and the MVP of the 1949 Sugar Bowl.

<doc id="56934335" url="?curid=56934335" title="Otake Chikuha">
Otake Chikuha

 was a Japanese painter. He was first known for his "nihonga" and "ukiyo-e" paintings. Although he was a praised figure at the height of his career, he later lost his reputation. He moved onto experimenting with more ambitious styles motivated by his anti-mainstream sentiments.
Early life.
Chikuha was born in Niigata City, Niigata Prefecture as Somekichi in 1878. His father Otake Kuramatsu was a dyer, who also painted under the name Otake Kokuseki. His two brothers, Etsudo and Kokkan both became proliferate painters, and the three of them came to be known as the Otake Brothers.
Career.
At the age of four, he learned "nanga" under Sasada Unseki, and received the pseudonym Chikuha. In 1891, he moved to Toyama where his older brother, Etsudo lived at the time. To make a living, he started working on images for newspapers, and preliminary sketches for medicine advertisements. In 1896, he moved to Tokyo following his younger brother Kokkan who left three years earlier, and became a disciple of Kawabata Gyokusho. He also learned "yamato-e" techniques of portraiture from Kobori Tomoto, bird-and-flower painting from Kajita Hanko, Kano school line drawing from Hashimoto Gaho.
He started sending his works to Kyoshinkai, biennial exhibitions hosted by Nihon Kaiga Kyokai and Inten hosted by Nihon Bijutsuin. Both of these institutions were led by Okakura Tenshin, an influential figure in developing Japanese modern art institutions. Through these submissions and subsequent attention by Tenshin, Chikuha made himself known in the field. However, in 1908, due to political differences among artist groups and movements, Chikuha left Tenshin in anger.
His leave from Tenshin marks the beginning of his most proliferate period, during which he produced his most famous works. This includes "The Visit" ("Otodure"), his most known work which won "nito sho" (highest prize) in Bunten in 1910 (currently at National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo). He also won the "santo sho" (second highest prize) in 1909, "nito sho" in 1911. Although he continued to submit works to Bunten until 1918, he did not win any further awards. Due to his frustration, he decided to run for the general election in 1915, for a position in the House of Representatives. He did not get elected, and ended with much debt. It is this failure that lead him to decline in his later years.
In order to pay back his debt, Chikuha produced hundreds of "Sun", on sea waves, which caused his reputation to decline in the artistic community. Despite this he kept painting artistically vigorous works, moving from detailed portraits and sceneries to vivid abstracts.

Armenia S. White

Armenia S. White (November 1, 1817 – May 7, 1916) was an American suffragist, philanthropist, and social reformer. She was the first president of the New Hampshire Woman's Suffrage Association, and was well known for her many years, along with her husband, Nathaniel White, of Concord, New Hampshire, in works of philanthropy and reform.
Early years and education.
Armenia Smith Aldrich was born in Mendon, Massachusetts, November 1, 1817, daughter of John and Harriet (Smith) Aldrich. Her direct paternal line of ancestry in the United States began with George Aldrich, who, with his wife Catherine, came from Derbyshire, England, in 1631, and in 1663 was among the early settlers of Mendon, removing there from Braintree, Massachusetts. Jacob Ahlrich, son of George, married Huldah, daughter of Ferdinando Thayer, and was the father of Moses, born in 1690. Moses Aldrich was a preacher of the Quakers in Rhode Island. He travelled as an approved minister, not only in the colonies later forming the original states of the American Union, but in the West Indies and in England. He married in 1711 Hannah White.
Judge Caleb Aldrich, son of Moses, is mentioned in the "History of Woonsocket, Rhode Island", as father of Naaman and grandfather of John Aldrich, all of Smithfield, Rhode Island. Naaman was the father of John Aldrich, who was the father of Mrs. White.
White's maternal ancestry included three "Mayflower" Pilgrims, Edward Doty, Francis Cooke, and Stephen Hopkins, also Mr. Hopkins's second wife, Elizabeth, and their daughter Damaris, who both came with him to Plymouth, Massachusetts. White's mother, Harriet Smith Aldrich, was born, as recorded in Smithfield, February 21, 1795. She was a daughter of Samuel Smith and his wife, Hope Doten. Her parents were married at Plymouth, May 31, 1791, and moved to Smithfield. Samuel was a Revolutionary War soldier, born in Smithfield, enlisting in the American army at the age of sixteen years. The Doty-Doten genealogy shows that Hope Doten, born in Plymouth, in 1765, was daughter of James and Elizabeth (Kempton) Doten, and was descended from Edward Doty and his wife. Faith Clark, through John and Elizabeth (Cooke) Doty, Isaac' and Martha (Faunce) Doten, and Isaac* and Mary (Lanman) Doten, Isaac being father of James and grandfather of Hope Doten, White's maternal grandmother. Elizabeth, wife of John Doty (or Doten), was the daughter of Jacob Cooke (son of Francis') and his wife Damaris, daughter of Stephen Hopkins and his wife Elizabeth.
After the marriage of John Aldrich and Harriet Smith, they moved from Smithfield to Mendon. In 1830, Mr. and Mrs. John Aldrich removed from Mendon, to Boscawen, New Hampshire. Their daughter, Armenia, was educated in the public schools.
Career.
On November 1, 1836, on her nineteenth birthday, she married Nathaniel White, a young stage driver six years her senior, a native of Lancaster, New Hampshire. For four years after marriage, the Whites boarded in Concord, New Hampshire, his business being such as to render housekeeping inexpedient. For eight years thereafter, they kept house on Warren Street.
In 1848, they moved to a home in Concord, which then fronted on School Street, but after the opening of Capitol Street, when the State House was re-modelled, it was enlarged and improved and the entrance changed to Capitol Street. After Nathaniel's death in 1880, White remained, managing the affairs of the large estate left in her hands, and continuing her interest and efforts in the various charitable, benevolent and reform causes and enterprises, in which she had been engaged for many years.
Reared as a Quaker, she espoused the cause of Universalism, then just commanding the attention of people in the community, when making her choice of religious affiliation in Concord, and, with her husband, was active in the movement for the organization of a society and the establishment of. regular worship under that name and faith. Fully believing as did her husband also, in woman’s right to active participation in religious as well as civil affairs, it was through their influence that women were admitted to membership in this society—the first in Concord to admit them. She was soon instrumental in the organization of a woman’s auxiliary, known as the Ladies’ Social Aid Society, working in aid of the social and material interests of the denomination, of which she was chosen president, holding that position continually until her death, though for the last few years debarred, on account of physical disability, from the performance of its active duties. Throughout her life, working conjointly with her husband, as in other worthy causes, till his decease, and in her own behalf and in his name thereafter, she gave of her time and means, labor, care and devotion, for the welfare of this church, whose house of worship, originally built largely through their material contribution, and more than once re-modelled and improved in good part at their expense, was named, after Mr. White’s decease, in their honor— the “White Memorial Church.”
She was first and foremost among the women of the city and state in espousing every important cause in the fields of reform and philanthropy, and every movement in which she was interested in, commanded her support in time, money and effort. To the antislavery cause, with her husband, she was earnestly devoted. The temperance movement received their support in New Hampshire; and it was largely through White’s instrumentality that the New Hampshire Woman’s Christian Temperance Union was organized, of which she was elected the first president, holding the position, long in an active and later in an honorary capacity.
No cause was more dear to her, and none so long and persistently labored for, as that whose object was the enfranchisement of her own sex and the elevation of woman to the plane of political equality with man. She was the pioneer of the woman suffrage movement in New Hampshire. She was the first signer of the call for the first equal suffrage convention in the state, held in Eagle Hall, in Concord, in December 1868, in collaboration with Sarah Piper of Concord. White called the meeting to order and was elected the first president of the New Hampshire Woman Suffrage Association then organized, and held that position, until 1895, when she felt compelled to retire, thereafter holding the position of honorary president.
She was a delegate to the American Woman Suffrage Association, organized at Cleveland, Ohio, immediately after the New Hampshire Association was formed, and was vice-president of that association for New Hampshire many years. Mainly through her efforts, supported by her husband, the state legislature, in 1871, made women eligible to serve on school committees, and, in 1878, granted them the right of school suffrage, before any other New England state had accorded them such privilege.
White was active in organizing suffrage meetings and very hospitable in entertaining speakers, Lucy Stone, Mary Livermore, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Julia Ward Howe, and many others, having been her guests from time to time. She had in charge the New Hampshire tables at several suffrage bazaars held in Boston, and in various ways contributed to their success.
She was a constant and liberal contributor to the New Hampshire Centennial Home for the Aged, the Orphans' Home at Franklin, and the Mercy Home at Manchester. At the age of ninety-three, she still retained the presidency of the Ladies' Social Aid Society.
Personal life.
Nathaniel was born at Lancaster, New Hampshire, February 7, 1811, being a son of Samuel and Sarah (Freeman) White and descendant of William White, an early settler of Essex County, Massachusetts. For a number of years in his youth, he was employed in the Columbian Hotel in Concord. He started in business for himself in 1832, becoming a part owner in the stage route between Concord and Hanover, New Hampshire, later buying the line between Concord and Lowell, Massachusetts. In 1837, in partnership with Captain William Walker, he established himself in the express business, making tri-weekly trips to Boston. Upon the opening of the Concord Railroad in 1842, he became one of the original members of the express company then organized to deliver goods throughout New Hampshire and Canada. In his forty-eight years of business life, he purchased valuable realty in Chicago, hotel property in New Hampshire, and stock in various railroad corporations, banks, manufactories, and other companies, in addition to his interests in the express company and in Concord real estate. He took a deep interest in the establishment of the New Hampshire Asylum for the Insane, the State Reform School, the Orphans' Home at Franklin, New Hampshire, to which he gave a generous endowment, and of the Home for the Aged at Concord. He died at his home in Concord, October 2, 1880.
The children of Mr. and Mrs. White were John A., born March 31, 1838, died November 26, 1899; Armenia E., born March 22, 1847, married Horatio Hobbs of Boston, subsequently deceased: Lizzie H., born February 20, 1849, married Charles H. Newhall of Lynn, Massachusetts, died December 12, 1887; Annie F., born May 22, 1852, died November 9, 1865: Nathaniel Jr., born June 8, 1855, died October 4, 1904; Selden F., born July 10, 1857, died in infancy; Benjamin C., born June 16, 1861. There was also an adopted daughter, Harriet S., widow of Dr. David P. Dearborn of Brattleboro, Vermont.
She and her husband were original members of the Universalist Society in Concord. Long known as the "first lady of the land" in New Hampshire, White died on May 7, 1916.

Quince Ensemble (Sometimes referred to as Quince Contemporary Vocal Ensemble) is a contemporary treble vocal ensemble that specializes in contemporary classical music. In 2010, Amanda DeBoer Bartlett and Kayleigh Butcher met at a Neko Case concert in Bowling Green, Ohio while attending Bowling Green State University. Focusing on an all-female group, the two assembled a five-member ensemble consisting of McKayela Collins-Hornor, Aubrey von Almen, Liz Pearse, Kayleigh Butcher, and Amanda DeBoer Bartlett within a year. As performance schedules became more demanding, Aubrey and McKayela left the group, and Carrie Henneman Shaw of Ensemble Dal Niente joined the ensemble, resulting in the current quartet roster.
Quince has since performed extensively throughout the United States, performing primarily new music works by 20th and 21st century composers including: David Lang, Morton Feldman, and Steve Reich and most recently, Jennifer Jolley and Kate Soper (composer).
Quince is signed to New Focus Recordings, and has released two albums with them.

Dharma Bum Temple

Dharma Bum Temple is an American Buddhist temple in San Diego, California. The temple focuses on being an introductory center for beginners to learn Buddhism and aims to provide a space for Americans to practice Buddhism in the comfort of their own culture. It has its roots in Taiwanese Buddhism but identifies with ecumenical Buddhism, or interdenominational Buddhism.
Dharma Bum Temple was founded on New Year's Eve in 2006 by a group of three people. It was originally located in Downtown San Diego, where it became popular among locals and college students from the nearby San Diego State University (SDSU). The temple was involved in the founding of the first Buddhist college fraternity in the United States, Delta Beta Tau. Dharma Bum Temple made headlines in local newspapers in 2017 with its campaign to buy the 1927-built Swedenborgian Church in University Heights, San Diego, which the temple relocated to later that year.
Dharma Bum Temple holds free meditation and Buddhism classes for the general public and organizes community service events in the area. The temple is known for directing its members to other Buddhist temples in the area based on the forms of Buddhism that interest the person. The temple routinely hosts guest speakers from various traditions of Buddhism and organizes field trips to other Buddhist temples in the area. 
History.
Founding.
Dharma Bum Temple was founded by a group who met at a local Buddhist temple in San Diego in 2003. One of the members of the group, Jeffrey Zlotnik, eventually became president of the English-language chapter of the local temple. In 2005, the group went to the Fo Guang Shan monastery in Taiwan to study Buddhism and was invited to open a temple in San Diego under the International Bodhisattva Sangha in 2006. However, due to logistical problems and a lack of funding, the group abandoned the project shortly after opening the temple. Later that year, the group opened its own temple in Downtown San Diego under the name "Dharma Bum Center", after the 1958 Jack Kerouac book "The Dharma Bums". In September 2008, the temple officially changed its name to "Dharma Bum Temple".
In Downtown San Diego.
Dharma Bum Temple was located in and operated from Downtown San Diego from the end of 2006 to April 2017. When the temple reached maximum capacity in 2008, it attempted to move to a larger location in Downtown San Diego, but returned to the original building when the new location was found to not be suitable. In 2009, the temple acquired a Buddhist gift shop near San Diego State University (SDSU) called "Buddha for You" at the request of the previous owner, who was elderly and wanted somebody to entrust the store to. Although the gift shop rarely generated profit for Dharma Bum Temple, it played a significant role in the expansion of the temple's community. Due to its proximity to SDSU, Dharma Bum Temple and its services at "Buddha for You" became popular among college students and the temple eventually started holding regular events on the campus. This included the organization of an SDSU meditation club called the "Aztec Dharma Bums" and the founding of the first Buddhist college fraternity in the United States, Delta Beta Tau (ΔΒΤ).
Before the temple relocated, its services were divided between its main building in Downtown and the gift shop "Buddha for You". The latter hosted two meditation classes a week, attended by about forty participants each. The temple spent five years looking for a place to expand to but was unable to find a suitable location until 2016.
Campaign to buy the Swedenborgian Church.
In October 2016, Dharma Bum Temple started a campaign to purchase the Swedenborgian Church in University Heights, San Diego. According to Dharma Bum Temple co-founder Jeffrey Zlotnik, the church was the ideal place to expand to because it was centrally located near several major neighborhoods and districts in San Diego, was free from Downtown San Diego's parking and traffic problems, and was large enough to accommodate the growing congregation.
A developer offered $1.4 million for the church, which Dharma Bum Temple offered to match. However, preference was given to Dharma Bum Temple because the prior owner wanted the church to continue to be used for a spiritual purpose. Although Dharma Bum Temple only had $7,000 at the time, the temple agreed and entered escrow, having to raise $490,000 for the down payment within 108 days. To raise the money, Zlotnik launched a fundraising campaign on Facebook to ask for donations.
The campaign did very well, raising $103,800 from 321 donors in its first two weeks. It caught the attention of several local news outlets in San Diego because the temple and its congregation were able to raise the funds so rapidly. Due to the news coverage, several consultants and organizations contacted Zlotnik to ask for fundraising advice. Dharma Bum Temple received the last string of donations needed to make the down payment on February 14, 2017, the final day of the fundraiser. By the end of the campaign, the temple had raised $497,000 from 1,123 donors in 108 days (about $4,600 per day).
Relocation to University Heights.
After closing escrow, Dharma Bum Temple officially moved to its new location in University Heights on April 15, 2017. Since relocating, the temple consolidated Dharma Bum Temple and its separate gift shop, "Buddha for You," as well as all of the services that were held there into the new larger location. The new temple is expected to have three meditation areas and be able hold up to 300 people at one time.
Services.
Dharma Bum Temple focuses on being an introductory center for westerners to learn Buddhism in a culturally approachable way. The temple avoids pressuring its members into cultural Buddhist practices that may make westerners feel uncomfortable, such as chanting and bowing. Members of the temple refer to themselves as "Dharma Bums". The temple has a policy of welcoming all groups, including other religions. Although it does not identify with any specific school of Buddhism, the temple emphasizes principles of Mahayana Buddhism such as the teachings of the Heart Sutra. Its teachings include overcoming problems and eliminating suffering through meditation and the development of Buddhist principles. Like many temples influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, Dharma Bum Temple stresses the benefit of pursuing the Bodhisattva Path through the cultivation of the Six Mahayana Paramitas.
The temple is known for directing members to other Buddhist temples in the San Diego area after they start showing deeper interest in a particular form of the religion after attending Dharma Bum Temple. It regularly hosts guest speakers from various traditions of Buddhism and holds field trips in the summer to other Buddhist temples in San Diego to introduce attendees to their traditions. The temple also offers introductory classes on Buddhism in Spanish. 
Dharma Bum Temple has a strict "no charge" policy and its teachers are instructed to never ask for donations or give a sermon on Dāna, or giving. According to temple co-founder Jeffrey Zlotnik, this policy is in place to avoid pressuring attendees into giving unwillingly, which he says reduces the value of the practice of generosity. As a result, Dharma Bum Temple services are always free of charge and the temple is run solely off of voluntary donations. 
The temple's services are attended by a diverse demographic, with its largest demographic being young adult Caucasians. The temple does not actively advertise itself and relies mostly on word of mouth to attract members. Its events are mainly coordinated online through platforms such as Facebook. Dharma Bum Temple focuses on the development of its community around the structure of families, offering individual programs for each age group; including for young children, teenagers, and adults, and has a family program called the "Family Sangha". Along with traditional Buddhist services, Dharma Bum Temple also hosts a Buddhism based support group called the "Recovery Sangha". The program combines elements of the traditional Twelve-Step Program with Buddhism and meditation to help drug and alcohol addicts overcome their addictions. The temple hosts multiple Buddhism and meditation classes throughout the week. As of December 2018, its most popular weekly services were attracting around 70 people per class. 
Community outreach.
Food redistribution.
Dharma Bum Temple operates a weekly feed the homeless program called "Food Redistribution". The temple and volunteers for the program do not purchase food for the program but instead collect food from stores and farms in the area who would have otherwise thrown it away for not being fresh or being too close to the expiration date. The focus of the program is not just to feed the homeless but also to combat excessive food waste. All food prepared for the Dharma Bum Temple food redistribution program is vegetarian.
Prison outreach.
Since 2006, Dharma Bum Temple regularly visits prisons to teach meditation or Buddhism to inmates in San Diego. The program emphasizes Buddhism as a way to develop traits such as wisdom and compassion, rather than being a Buddhist. The goal of the program is to improve the minds of inmates so they can reintegrate into society more smoothly once they are released from prison.
Delta Beta Tau.
In 2015, Dharma Bum Temple started to organize a Buddhist college fraternity at the suggestion of its co-founder Jeffrey Zlotnik, who was in Beta Theta Pi in college. Although the temple originally planned on creating a fraternity and a sorority, it ended up organizing a single co-ed fraternity. The first chapter of the fraternity was founded at San Diego State University (SDSU), which the temple already had a strong presence on. The temple had already been running a meditation club on the campus called "The Aztec Dharma Bums".
Delta Beta Tau (ΔΒΤ) was founded in September 2015 at SDSU as the first Buddhist college fraternity in the United States, its name was based on the initials of Dharma Bum Temple. The co-ed fraternity was founded on the principles of the Six Paramitas of Mahayana Buddhism. Rules and activities for the fraternity are based on Buddhist principles and to join pledges do community service and attend meditation retreats. In 2017, the fraternity announced plans to start a chapter at University of California, San Diego (UCSD).
As of August 20, 2019 the fraternity has initiated 223 active members at its founding chapter at SDSU.

Tompkins was born in Washington, D.C., to a family with roots in Virginia; through her father she was the niece of Sally Louisa Tompkins, in whose will she was remembered. Much of her professional career was spent in France, where she attended the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts and studied with Léon Bonnat. She showed work at the salons of Paris and Brussels, and at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. She also sent work back to the United States for exhibition on other occasions. Tompkins favored Italian subjects for her paintings; she also produced portraits and figure pieces during her career. She spent time working in New York City later in her career. One source claims she died in that city; another states that she died in the city of her birth, where she is buried in the Oak Hill Cemetery. It has been claimed that her work is held by both the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, but it is unclear if this is still true.

Suicide of Hamed Nastoh

Hamed Bismel Nastoh (December 18, 1985 – March 11, 2000) was a Canadian high school student who died by suicide by jumping off the Pattullo Bridge due to bullying.
Early life.
Nastoh was born to Afghan parents in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada. Hamed Nastoh attended Enver Creek Secondary School in Surrey, along with his brother Abdullah. Nastoh was described as a smart student who liked horror movies, reading, dancing and music. Nastoh, then 14 years old, was bullied in person. In a note he mentions to his parents that high school was terrible for him, everyone in his school would call him "gay", "fag", "queer", "four-eyes" and "big-nose" because his average grades were above 90 percent. He left a suicide note saying "I hate myself for doing this to you," he wrote to his parents. "I really, really hate myself, but there is no other way out."
The Nastoh family lived on 143rd Street in Surrey, around away from the Pattullo Bridge, which spans the Fraser River and links Surrey and New Westminster. At 5:00 pm, Nastoh's mother, father, and younger brother, David, went outside to hang out with a neighbour. Hamed and his older brother, Abdullah, were home during the night. One hour later, Abdullah took a shower. Hamed put on his new Tommy Hilfiger jacket, left the house and made his way, probably by bus, to the Pattullo Bridge. When Nastoh arrived at the bridge he jumped to his death.
Investigation.
When Abdullah got out of the shower, he realized that Hamed had disappeared. He phoned his parents, and their father, Kirim, rushed home to investigate. On finding the note, he phoned the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Hamed did not give any hints about how he killed himself, and the RCMP searched around Nastoh's home.
The day after, police found his body in the Fraser River, just south of the Pattullo Bridge. He wore a blue Nike backpack filled with rocks to weigh himself down. According to the coroner's report, "They were unnecessary." Hamed Nastoh died from blunt trauma after his eye hit a rock in the water at around . The only noticeable mark was a minor scratch on his nose.
A week before his death, Hamed had attended a suicide awareness talk at Enver Creek Secondary School, given by a mother who had lost her son. In his note, Hamed wrote that he'd given his parents a "hint" when he mentioned that the speaker had said that suicidal people give hints.
Aftermath and impact on schools.
Homosexuality issues high school course.
Hamed's suicide from the Patullo Bridge made the Government of British Columbia to introduce the Grade 12 Homosexuality issues course. This course was developed in 2007 and is considered an elective course for Grade 12 high school students.
This course was meant to prevent a trial in court before the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal, which made the agreement to listen to a gay couples complaints that secondary schools in British Columbia are blameworthy of prejudice by not talking about sexual identities as how the curriculum expects.
As a comeback, the Liberal Party of Canada agreed with the Government of British Columbia in developing this course, which discusses the topic of tolerance, especially how it relates to sexual identities, ethnicity and race. However, the course will not be mandatory in 37 secondary schools in British Columbia that represent over 8,000 students.
Hamed Nastoh's Anti-Bullying Coalition.
Hamed mentioned in his suicide note for the reader to go to all the secondary schools in Surrey. He wanted other students to know that all forms of bullying can have a bad impact on the victim. Listening to his message, Nasima formed Hamed Nastoh's Anti-Bullying Coalition, to raise awareness of bullying in elementary and high schools, and help parents of children suffering from bullying. Nasima has presented Hamed's suicide note and story to numerous schools in British Columbia.
His mother states her message is clear and simple: "Suicide is not the solution." Using her son's suicide note to show how much he suffered in high school before committing suicide, Nasima hopes to give support to teenagers and the community and assure them they are not alone. Nasima said, "Seek help. If you don't talk about it nobody can hear," noting that children and teenagers are afraid of having discussions about being bullied if they notify their parents or teachers. Nasima says that Hamed Nastoh's Anti-Bullying Coalition has given her confidence to overcome her agony and misery.

Radbod of Seez

Bishop Radbod (Radbodus) was a French prelate of the 11th century.
Family.
Before becoming bishop of Sees, Radbod had a son, Guillaume Bonne-Âme, abbot of Saint-Etienne de Caen (1070-1079), then archbishop of Rouen (1079-1110). 
By his wife, he is related to the Flaitel family.
Biography.
His installation on the bishopric of Sees would be due to the will of the dukes of Normandy to regain control of the region held by Belleme.
His name appears in an act of donation of Richard, duke of Normandy, to Bernay Abbey dated 1027 at the latest. He also subscribes to the charter of Cerisy in 1032.

Sigefroi

Sigefroi or Sifroi (Sigefridus) was a Norman prelate of the early 11th century in what is today France.
Sigefroi was probably installed in the bishopric of Sees by the lords of Belleme around 1017. They restores some of the property of the bishopric they had monopolized in order to restore the chapter cathedral.
Sigefroi signed a charter of Guillaume de Dijon, abbot of Fécamp in 1017. In another document Sigefroi confirms in 1020 the donation of Richard, duke of Normandy, to the church of Sées of half of the city and the land of Boéville.

Azon the Venerable (Atso or Azo) was a prelate of the late 10th and early 11th century.
Under his rule the episcopal seat of Sées is restored after more than half a century of vacancy, following the destruction of the Carolingian cathedral and the enslavement by the Vikings of his bishop Adelin. This recovery is linked to the ecclesiastical normalization undertaken by the Duke of Normandy Richard Ist. During his episcopate, Azon raised the ruins of Sees Cathedral around 986, using stones from the fortifications of the city) the Venerable This cathedral will be burned by Yves de Bellême in 1047 to dislodge brigands knights.

Henry Adams (Wisconsin politician)

Henry Adams (April 30, 1811 - July 30, 1871) was a Green County, Wisconsin farmer who served as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly and the Wisconsin State Senate, as well as holding various local offices.
Background.
Adams was born on April 30, 1811 in Bedford County, Pennsylvania. He married Sarah Mills, likewise a Bedford County native, and they remained there for some time before moving to Coshocton County, Ohio where they lived until leaving for Wisconsin in 1845. They started a farm of 160 acres in what would become Mount Pleasant, Green County, Wisconsin. 
Public office.
Adams soon became active in public affairs. 
County and township offices.
In 1847 he was elected one of the county's three county commissioners. After statehood, in June 1849 he was chairman of the town board for Mount Pleasant, and thus "ex officio" a member of the county board of supervisors, remaining in that position until November of 1851. He returned to the board for the November 1853 session, being elected board chairman. In 1856, Adams was an unsuccessful candidate for county register of deeds. From 1861, state law reduced the county board to three supervisors. Adams was elected from the first district (the Towns of New Glarus, York, Exeter, Brooklyn, Washington and Mount Pleasant) in 1861, and re-elected in 1863. (He also served as assessor and justice of the peace for the township.)
State office.
Upon statehood, he was elected to the Green County seat in the State Assembly for the 1st Wisconsin Legislature as a Democrat, with 469 votes to 398 for John W. Stewart. He was not a candidate for re-election, and was succeeded by John C. Crawford, a Whig. In 1853, he ran for Wisconsin's 24th State Senate district, losing to Francis H. West, a Democrat who in the next session would join the newly-organized Republican Party. In 1859, he ran against old opponent John Stewart (now a Republican) for the vacant Senate seat (Republican incumbent John H. Warren was not a candidate), losing with 1175 votes to Stewart's 1633. In 1865, he won the Senate seat as a National Union candidate, with 1,517 votes to 746 for H. T. Pearson. He was re-elected in 1867 as a Republican, with 2,064 votes to 1,112 for a "Mr. Passmore" (first name unknown). He was not a candidate for re-election in 1869 (having moved to Hardin County, Iowa), and was succeeded by "Independent Republican" John C. Hall.
Civic organizations.
In addition to governmental offices, he served as an officer of the Green County Agricultural Society, and as a trustee for the Monticello Cemetery. 
Leaving and returning to Green County.
The Adams' sold their farm in 1868 and moved to Hardin County, Iowa, but soon returned to Green County, settling in Monroe, where they lived until Henry died on July 13, 1871. They had had ten children, eight still living at the time of his death.

John Laver

John David Michael Henry Laver, (20 January 1938 – 6 May 2020) was a British phonetician. He was Emeritus Professor of Speech Sciences at Queen Margaret University, and served as President of the International Phonetic Association from 1991 to 1995.
Life and career.
Laver was born in Nowshera, British India. His father was in the Indian and later British Army. He was raised in India for six years and spoke Hindustani and English, and later lived in Egypt, Libya, Kenya, and Cyprus up until the age of ten. After attending a boarding school in Hampshire, Laver entered the Royal Air Force College Cranwell to pursue a career as a military pilot, which he eventually gave up. He subsequently entered the University of Edinburgh in 1958 and graduated in 1962 with a degree in French language and literature. At Edinburgh, he was introduced to phonetics and to the Department of Phonetics headed by David Abercrombie, under which he obtained a postgraduate diploma in 1963.
From 1963 to 1966, Laver was a lecturer at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria. Formally, his post at Ibadan lasted for three years, but in the second year he was substituted by John Kelly while Laver returned to Edinburgh in exchange. In 1966, he was appointed a lecturer at Edinburgh, where he received a PhD in 1975, supervised by Abercrombie. In 1985, he was appointed Professor of Phonetics at Edinburgh, where he later received a Doctor of Letters. He was President of the International Phonetic Association from 1991 to 1995.
He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 1990 and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) in 1994. In the 1999 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to phonetics.
In 2013, Trinity College Dublin awarded him an honorary doctorate.
With Ronald E. Asher, Laver served as general editor of "The Encyclopedic Dictionary of Speech and Language" for Wiley-Blackwell, which involved nearly 40 contributors and was completed in 2013 after about 25 years of preparation. During a period of Laver's illness, however, Wiley-Blackwell withdrew from the contract, reverting copyright to the contributors.
He died in Scotland on 6 May 2020 after a long illness.
Personal life.
Laver married his colleague Sandy Hutcheson in 1974.

Ken Hinckley

Ken Hinckley (born 1969) is an American computer scientist and inventor. He is a senior principal research manager at Microsoft Research. He is known for his research in human-computer interaction, specifically on sensing techniques, pen computing, and cross-device interaction.
Background.
After received his bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1991, Hinckley completed a master's degree in Computer Science (1993) and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Virginia (1996), where he studied with advisor Randy Pausch.
Hinckley began working at Microsoft Research in 1997, where his primary research areas include novel input devices, device form-factors, and modalities of interaction. Hinckley has received numerous professional distinctions in the field of human-computer interaction. He has published over 80 academic papers in this field, and claims more than 150 patents. Hinckley is a member of the CHI Academy and has served as associate editor at ACM TOCHI (Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction) since 2003. His work has been cited more than 8000 times.
Work.
Hinckley has made notable contribution to the areas of human-computer modalities and their hardware design. His work spans numerous, often-overlapping topics, including bimanual interaction, sensing devices and techniques, pen and touch interaction, and cross-device interaction.
Bimanual interaction.
In the 1990s, Hinckley studied bimanual interaction at the University of Virginia, often in collaboration with doctoral advisor Pausch. His work had applications in the field of neurosurgery, specifically, in neurosurgical medical imaging.
Hinckley's doctoral thesis, "Haptic Issues for Virtual Manipulation" (1997) investigated two-handed spatial interaction in user interfaces for applications in neurosurgical visualization. The paper presents two-handed virtual manipulation as an alternative interaction technique for the WIMP interface and investigates the role of passive haptic feedback in virtual manipulation. Hinckley's thesis work was conducted in collaboration with the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Virginia.
Hinckley's research in bimanual interaction suggests that two-handed interfaces can offer cognitive advantages for the user, such as providing a perceptual frame of reference independent of visual feedback that single-handed interfaces lack.
Sensing techniques.
At Microsoft Research, Hinckley has studied sensing techniques in interaction with mobile handheld devices. In "Sensing Techniques for Mobile Interaction" (2000), Hinckley and co-authors Jeff Pierce, Mike Sinclair, and Eric Horvitz integrated hardware sensors into a mobile device to enable functionalities such as automatically powering up when the user picks up the device and switching between portrait and landscape display modes when the device's physical orientation changes. Implementation of tilt, touch, and proximity sensors produced a context-sensitive interface that responded to the user and the environment. Hinckley's research introduced new modes of interaction for mobile device UI design. Hinckley and his colleagues were awarded the UIST 2000 Best Paper Award for "Sensing Techniques for Mobile Interaction".
"Sensor Synaesthesia: Touch in Motion, and Motion in Touch" was published at CHI 2011. The work investigated multimodal input techniques on mobile handheld devices, specifically, how the combination of touch and motion sensing mutually enhanced, and enabled, synaesthetic techniques such as tilt-to-zoom and differentiating soft taps from hard taps. Hinckley and co-author Hyunyoung Song received the CHI 2011 Honorable Mention Award for their research.
Pen computing.
Some of Hinckley's recent work in sensing includes "Sensing Techniques for Stylus + Touch Interaction" (2014). A study conducted by researchers at University of Manitoba, Cornell University, and Microsoft Research explored grip and motion sensing in pen and touch interaction. The study employed a number of tools that evaluate user grip and motion behaviors in order to contextualize usage patterns using stylus and tablet devices. For instance, the research demonstrated how tablet grip sensing techniques could be used as heuristics to detect unintentional thumb contact with the touch screen. The project was featured on Gizmodo and FastCo Design.
Microsoft Office Keyboard.
As a member of the Microsoft Corporation Hardware Design Group, Hinckley served as a primary designer of the Microsoft Office Keyboard. The Microsoft Corporation Hardware Design Group was awarded the HFES (Human Factors and Ergonomics Society) User Centered Consumer Product Design Award by the HFES Consumer Product Technical Group.

Govindabhatta

Govinda-bhaṭṭa, known by his pen name Akbariya Kālidāsa ("Kalidasa of Akbar"), was a 16th-century Sanskrit-language court poet from present-day India. His patrons included Rewa's ruler Ramachandra and the Mughal emperor Akbar.
Works.
The texts attributed to Govindabhatta include:
Govindabhatta appears to have become quite popular, as his verses appear in at least six anthologies of the 17th and the 18th centuries. The texts that cite his verses include "Subhashita-haravali" (c. 1650), "Padyamrta-tarangini" (c. 1673), "Rasika-jivana" (later than c. 1735), Sundaradeva's "Sukti-Sundara", "Padyareni", and "Padyarchana".
Most of Govindabhatta's extant verses are devoted to description and praise of kings. The kings praised by him include Akbar (whom he calls Kabilendra or Jallaladin) and Ramachandra of Rewa (whom he calls Vaghela). He may have adopted the pen-name "Akbariya Kalidasa" to please Emperor Akbar.
In his poems, Govindabhatta pays homage to the gods Vishnu, Shiva, Bhavani, Ganesha, Krishna, Durga, and Jvalapa (Jvalamukhi).

Morgan Chua

Morgan Chua Heng Soon () (3 May 1949 – 22 March 2018) was a Singaporean political cartoonist. He was born in the Year of the Bull and the month of Taurus, his signature mascot.
Chua was known for his astute and biting political cartoons. He was described as "Review's Unsparing Brushman" by the "South China Morning Post" in the March 14, 1976 issue and by Asia Week as the "Legendary Cartoonist of Singapore".
Early life.
Chua was born at Byrne's Maternity Clinic in Singapore on May 3, 1949. He is the eldest of seven children (five younger sisters and a younger brother) born to Henry Chua Peng Yam, an Electrical and Sanitary Contractor, and his wife, Lily Teo Wah Sek. He spent his childhood in 350-B, Geylang Lorong 18, Singapore.
Describing his childhood, Chua mentioned he often drew animated strips with rolled paper to entertain his sisters, brother and the children in our neighborhood. Many believed these strips were good enough for entrance to the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) in Singapore.
Chua was educated in Presbyterian Boys’ School and he joined the 5th Singapore Company of Boys’ Brigade.
"National Pioneer".
Chua belongs to the first batch of young men to be called up for the national service in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) in 1967. His drawings were first published by the "Pioneer" ("National Pioneer" in the early days), a magazine published by SAF which provides news on army matters relating to Singapore. The cover of first issue is in plain text and a photo, and Chua's illustrations was published in the second and sequence issues.
He came to realization that he could use cartoon to represent people's voices and worked voluntarily for the "National Pioneer". "I will always serve my people and my country", Chua said.
Career.
The "Singapore Herald".
Chua began working for the newly established daily "The Singapore Herald" in 1970 as the chief editorial artist, joined by Lionel Rajapaksa and Gopal Chandradas. In 1971, the government closed the paper, alleging foreign financed plots, “Black Operations”. The paper was critical of then prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew who was offended by Chua's cartoon of Lee on a tank threatening to crush a baby representing press freedoms that reportedly caused the newspaper's shutdown.
"Far Eastern Economic Review".
Chua moved to Hong Kong, to the newly established weekly, "The Asian". Derek Davies, the editor of the "Far Eastern Economic Review" (FEER) had taken notice of Chua from his days in Singapore. So after travelling and working in Europe for 3.5 months, in late 1972 he began to do cartoons for the FEER. This led to him being hired as its first art director on December 1, 1972, at the age of 23. His work in this period included images of leaders such as Prince Sihanouk, Tun Razak, Indira Gandhi and Lee Kuan Yew.
The FEER enjoyed almost two decades of rapid growth. Iconic covers include Chua's image of Li Ka-shing as "Superman Li", and Margaret Thatcher leading the surrender. In 1981, Chua received a letter from Li Ka-shing for FEER's "Superman Li" cover. According to Chua, his inspiration for this cover was partly influenced by his son.
Tiananmen incident.
Morgan took a sabbatical from the FEER in 1988–89 to travel the Silk Road and other parts of China in early 1989. That happened to coincide with the Tiananmen Square protests on June 4, 1989, and Chua was so shocked by this event that he draw more than 100 cartoons of the massacre and was later published in his book "Tiananmen" in the same year.
Martial art.
While in Hong Kong, Chua has mastered the martial art, Wing Chun in the early 1970s. Chua was trained by one of Bruce Lee's instructors, believed to be Wong Shun Leung.
Retirement.
Back to Singapore.
Returning to FEER, he remained there until changing circumstance at the publication combined with a desire to return closer to his Singaporean roots. He returned to Singapore in 1999 and spent the most of the next 20 years between Singapore and Tanjung Pinang, Bintan, an island in Indonesia just across the straits from Singapore where it was close enough to the city.
As a semi-retiree enjoying life, he accepted the limitations of cartooning in Singapore and became acceptable to the leaders, including doing a book of cartoons of Lee Kuan Yew which was, he said, to "show the humane side” of the leader". In a short span of 20 years back in Singapore, he has closely worked with publishers, inspired many young cartoonists and illustrators and has published a few books of cartoons, particular to Singaporean.
In 2011, he received a complimentary letters from Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Hsien Loong for his work on Lee's late wife, Madam Kwa Geok Choo — "In Memory of Kwa Geok Choo (1921-2010)", which according to Chua "is even better than the Cultural Medallion award".
Illustrations for BBC.
The illustrations of Zhou Yong-kang by Chua for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was published on June 13, 2015. Zhou was convicted of bribery, abuse of power and the intentional disclosure of state secrets by the Intermediate Court. Zhou was said to have taken 129 million yuan (over $20 million) in bribes.
Death.
Chua was hard at work right up to the time he was down with Pleural effusion. He died on Thursday, 22 March 2018, aged 68, after he was hospitalized in a hospital in Bintan, Indonesia. and in a coma from which he never recovered. Chua was accompanied by his son and returned to Singapore on March 23, 2018.
Chua is now rested in Mandai Columbarium and his plaque is engraved with his signature mascot, a Taurus Bull, and quotes about his artwork.
Selected works.
Chua illustrated former president S. R. Nathan's "50 Stories From My Life".

Blue Tent Creek

Blue Tent Creek is a stream in the U.S. state of California. The stream flows for before it empties into the Sacramento River.
Two traditions attempt to explain the name "Blue Tent Creek": firstly, it may derive its name from the blue tent of a local prospector; secondly that it was named after a blue tent which was a landmark on a local stagecoach route.

Junud al-Makhdi

Katibat Junud al-Makhdi (commonly referred to as just Junud al-Makhdi) is an active armed jihadist group created by a merger of two smaller groups operating in Northern Syria, composed exclusively of Tatar and Bashkir fighters mainly from Tatarstan and Bashkortostan as well as other areas in Russia with Tatar and Bashkir populations.
History.
The group was created by a merger of Jamaat Bulgar and Jaish al-Shomal al-Islam in mid-2016 (each made up of Tatar fighters from Russia). Jamaat Bulgar was initially founded in Afghanistan with its headquarters in Waziristan by an Avar from Dagestan and its fighters fought alongside the Taliban while not being formally part of it for 10 years and became involved in the Syrian Civil War during the beginning with several fighters arriving in 2012. The second group was founded in Syria to combat the Assad regime. The leader of Jaish al-Shomal al-Islam is the current leader of the Junud al-Makhdi.
The group cooperates with the Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria as well as local Syrian Turkmen Brigades in the Latakia Governorate because of linguistic similarities in the Turkic languages. The group also calls on Russian Muslims to join its ranks as well as wage war domestically, and claims to have members active in both Russia and Yemen.

Every Generation Got Its Own Disease

"Every Generation Got Its Own Disease" (also simply known as "Every Generation") is a song by German rock band Fury in the Slaughterhouse. The song was released as the second single from the album "Mono".
Reception.
AllMusic reviewer Tom Demalon called the song "a dark, brooding cut with a hypnotic guitar line" and noted the bleak nature of the lyrics. Demalon said Kai Wingenfelder lacked much range, but called the song the band's best melody.
"Every Generation" is Fury in the Slaughterhouse's most popular and successful single. The song was a commercial success in the band's home country of Germany, peaking at a career high #44 on the Top 100 Singles chart. "Every Generation" was also a success on American rock radio, peaking at #13 and #21 on the Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts, respectively.

The Dark Element

The Dark Element is a Swedish/Finnish symphonic metal band formed by former Nightwish vocalist Anette Olzon and former Sonata Arctica guitarist Jani Liimatainen.
History.
In 2016, Frontiers Records offered Jani Liimatainen to record and publish a new album. Liimatainen had then thought that he was going to work with a female vocalist, because the singers of his previous projects had been men. Frontiers soon informed him that Anette Olzon would be the one. Also included in this album are some new songs from 2004, never used before.
The project was announced on August 29, 2017. The debut self-titled album was released on 10 November 2017, recorded with bassist Jonas Kuhlberg and drummer Jani Hurula (members of Cain's Offering).
The Dark Element gave its first show at the Sweden Rock Festival on June 7, 2018.
Their second album, "Songs the Night Sings" was released on 8 November 2019, recorded with new drummer Rolf Pilve (Stratovarius).

Organa (crater)

Organa is the informal name given to a crater on Pluto's largest moon, Charon. The crater was discovered by NASA's "New Horizons" space probe on its flyby of Pluto. The name was chosen as a reference to Leia Organa from the "Star Wars" media franchise in the theme of naming Charon's craters after science fiction characters. Organa crater is rich in frozen ammonia, which suggests it was created very recently. This crater is located in the northern Pluto-facing hemisphere of Charon.
Ammonia.
Organa crater is the only known crater on Charon that contains abundant ammonia. The ammonia was detected using the "New Horizons" LEISA instrument, by observing an absorption of infrared light in the band, which is associated with ammonia.
The source of the ammonia has not been confirmed, but it is associated with the impact process that created Organa crater, perhaps by removing the overlaying layer of water of ice and regolith. If this is confirmed, the detection could indicate that Charon has experienced cryovolcanic activity, with ammonia as magma. This interpretation is puzzling, since cryovolcanism isn't known to occur on such small bodies. In this scenario, the ammonia may have precipitated from an atmosphere, or soaked the ground from a subsurface source, or diffused out of the existing tholin.
An alternate explanation suggests the deposit of ammonia was delivered by the impactor that created Organa crater. In either case, it is believed that Organa crater is the result of a recent impact, less than 10 million years ago. The impact that created Organa crater may have been so recent that the ammonia hasn't yet been destroyed by radiation from space.

Adelaide Derby

The Adelaide Derby is an intra-city local derby between South Australia's two most historically successful football (soccer) clubs: Adelaide City and West Adelaide. The two sides were the first from the state to compete at national level when they became founding members of the National Soccer League in 1977. For more than 20 years, it was Adelaide's only intra-city derby. The rivalry was born before the national league developed however, when they competed in the state's first division. Adelaide City, then known as Adelaide Juventus were a club backed by Adelaide's Italian community, while West Adelaide Hellas drew their support from the city's Greek population. Since the demise of the NSL, the two clubs have returned to South Australian competition and continue their rivalry in the National Premier Leagues.
History.
State dominance: A rivalry is born.
Adelaide City was founded as Juventus in 1946 by a group of Italian migrants, some of whom had previously been members of a club called Savoia. In 1953, the club won its first South Australian first division title and its first Federation Cup. Juventus had won six league titles and five cups by the early 1960s. West Adelaide Hellas was founded in 1962 by some Greek migrants who had previously been part of the Hellenic Olympic club, banned by the South Australian Soccer Federation for crowd violence. The Greek club merged with the original West Adelaide, which was founded in 1910 and played home games at Hindmarsh Stadium. Like Juventus, it too quickly obtained promotion to the first division and the clubs established their rivalry.
Juventus and Hellas' first meeting came in September 1963, before the newly formed Hellas had even played its first game in the top tier. West Adelaide reached the final of that year's Federation Cup as it took out the second-tier competition. The final pit Hellas against Juventus but the dominant Italians proved too good for the upstarts, winning 5–1 in the final. Juventus won the first division that year – their seventh title.
Juventus also won the first league meeting between the two teams, a 2–0 away victory on 18 April 1964. However, later in the year, Hellas was to draw blood against its new rival for the first time. The sides again came face-to-face in the Federation Cup as they had the previous year. The first match ended in a 3-3 deadlock that extra time was unable to resolve, so a replay was contested. Hellas won 2-1 a week later and went on to win its first cup title. However, Juventus again won the league that year.
Again the two sides came against one another in the 1965 Federation Cup semi-final, Juventus this time exacting revenge and going on to win the title. In 1966, West Adelaide won the first division for the first time, taking out wins against Juventus home and away in the process. The first match between the pair that season finished 6–3 to Hellas and remains the highest scoring derby to date. The following year, Hellas thumped Juventus 4–0 in the league (to date its biggest derby win) and also demolished the Italian club 3–0 in the Federation Cup final. However, Juventus still managed to win the league, one point ahead of second-placed Hellas.
West Adelaide won the next two league championships, before Juventus won the league again in 1970. It also defeated Hellas in the Federation Cup final to claim the double. The two clubs had by now established themselves as South Australia's most powerful. Hellas won the 1971 competition, seven points clear of second-placed Juventus, but the Italian-backed club got revenge in the cup, beating Hellas in the final for the second straight season. Juventus would go on to win four Federation Cup finals in a row, all against West Adelaide.
Between 1966 and 1976, the two clubs won all but one league championship between them. Only Polonia Adelaide managed to break their dominance for a single season, winning the league in 1975.
The derby goes national.
Adelaide City, as the renamed Juventus was known, and West Adelaide became foundation members of the National Soccer League in 1977. On 20 June, the two clubs ran out for the first time against one another in a national competition. In front of 12,328 spectators, Adelaide City trounced West Adelaide 4–1 with goals from Brian Northcote, Agenor Muniz, Dixie Deans and John Nyskohus. Neil McGachey scored the only goal for Hellas. The match did not lack star quality, with Liverpool legend Graeme Souness lining up for West Adelaide. The return game at Olympic Sports Field finished 2-2. West Adelaide won an NSL Cup tie between the two clubs however, 3-2 after extra time. The two clubs were not allowed by the South Australian Soccer Federation to enter teams in the state competition that year, although they both re-entered in South Australia's second tier in 1978.
Arguably the biggest derby ever played between the two clubs was contested in the final round of the 1978 National Soccer League season. West Adelaide needed just a draw to win its first NSL title and become the first Adelaide club, and first outside New South Wales, to be crowned Australian champion. Adelaide City couldn't win the league but needed to win the game to deny its rival the title. John Perin scored the opening goal for the Italian-backed club with a long-range strike and City appeared destined to spoil West's party until Vic Bozanić lobbed home an equaliser five minutes from time. A crowd of 16,251 watched the game at Hindmarsh Stadium and it remains the highest recorded attendance of any derby between the two clubs.
West Adelaide wouldn't win another league derby until 1982. The two clubs also met semi-frequently in the NSL Cup, Hellas knocking City out of the 1982 and 1983 editions before the "Black and Whites" picked up a win in a new group phase format in 1984. Derby crowds dropped in the mid 1980s and only 3500 spectators watched City defeat West 4–1 at Olympic Sports Field in June 1985, where a young Aurelio Vidmar scored twice in his first derby. The NSL had been split into two conferences from 1984 to 1986 and the two Adelaide clubs competed alongside sides from Victoria and Queensland in the Southern conference. When the league's administrators chose to return to a single division for the 1987 season, they cut the number of clubs and relegated those which were not retained to their respective state leagues.
City had won its first league title in 1986 – a 2–1 loss to West Adelaide late in the season not withstanding. However, West Adelaide had struggled, finishing fourth from bottom in the conference. It was not included in the NSL for 1987 and did not return until the 1989–90 season, the first time the NSL was played in summer. West Adelaide's return to the national league was short-lived. The club finished second-to-last and lost both derbies on its return, although crowds had more than doubled since the mid-1980s. More than 10,000 watched the first derby at Hindmarsh Stadium where City had moved and would play out the rest of its time in the NSL. To make the NSL return more bitter for West, it also lost the 1989–90 NSL Cup Round of 16 game 3–0 to Adelaide City.
City soars, West struggles.
After another year in state league purgatory, West Adelaide returned to the NSL for the 1991–92 season. Again, City was ruthless in front of a 10,000-strong crowd at Hindmarsh, winning 4–1 with two goals apiece from club legend Sergio Melta and a young Carl Veart. Adelaide City would go on to win its second NSL title that season but West Adelaide was not going to be a pushover in the return fixture. More than 13,000 attended the game on 7 January 1992 and it was a future Socceroo striker Paul Agostino, then just 16 years old, who would get on to the end of a through ball and finish calmly past goalkeeper Robert Zabica to win the game 1-0 for West.
Both Adelaide City and West Adelaide made the finals in 1992–93 and the play-offs would pit the two Adelaide sides against one another at the business end of the season for the first time. It was Hellas that won the first leg of the semi-final but Adelaide City progressed after winning the second leg 2–1, having finished higher on the table after the minor round. Steve Maxwell scored the brace that ultimately helped City get past their local rivals although the season ended with a disappointing 1-0 grand final defeat to Marconi.
Adelaide City won another derby in December 1993; a 4-0 demolition. West Adelaide claimed glory two months later though, when Socceroo striker Greg Brown scored a brace in front of a packed Hindmarsh Stadium. His side won 2–0; City again won the championship. The two clubs also played off in a two-legged NSL Cup tie which City won 4–3 on aggregate.
The rest of the 1990s were particularly lean for West Adelaide as their crosstown rivals regularly finished among the top five and played finals football. West won the first derby of the 1994–95 season but the club's supporters did not realise they would only ever win one more NSL game against City again. West knocked City out of the 1994-95 NSL Cup on away goals after two drawn games, despite both matches being played at Hindmarsh Stadium. City won two derbies in each of the 1995–96 and 1996–97 seasons.
In 1998, West Adelaide rebranded itself as the Adelaide Sharks, in an attempt to attract more broadbased support beyond their traditional but dwindling base in Adelaide's Greek community. They ended City's run of derby wins with a 1–1 draw in their first derby under the Sharks moniker. Nathan Day, who would later play for City, scored West's goal. Adelaide City smashed the Sharks 5–0 in the first derby of the 1998–99 season. The result was the most one-sided in all 40 NSL games the two sides contested. There would only ever again be one more such derby in the national league.
Adelaide Sharks defeated City 1-0 thanks to a late Aleksandar Đurić goal on 4 April 1999. The crowd was just 3982 at Hindmarsh Stadium, almost 5000 less than watched the earlier fixture between the two clubs just three and a half months prior and a world removed from the crowds of more than 10,000 fans the derbies had traditionally attracted. Just a week before the 1999–00 season was due to start, the Sharks withdrew from the competition – bankrupt.
City would remain in the NSL until 2003 when it too pulled out of the competition, just weeks before the final edition was about to begin. It was replaced in the NSL by the newly formed Adelaide United, a club backed by the South Australian Soccer Federation and South Australian businessman and former Adelaide City sponsor Gordon Pickard. The April 1999 derby remains the last time two Adelaide clubs faced each other in a national league.
The derby is reborn.
Adelaide City returned its focus to the South Australian Premier League in 2004 upon withdrawing from the NSL. West Adelaide management legally separated its senior and junior arms into two clubs before the Sharks entered administration and ultimately folded in 1999.
West Adelaide's juniors survived through a merger with state league club Adelaide Olympic. In 2008, nine years since the last Adelaide derby was played in the NSL, West Adelaide ended its arrangement with Olympic and returned to fielding senior teams in the third tier of the South Australian competition. West Adelaide Hellas eventually won promotion back to the South Australian first tier, now called the National Premier Leagues South Australia, for the 2014 season.
West was drawn to host Adelaide City at its temporary home ground at West Beach in round 1 of its first season back in South Australia's top flight. The match was promoted in local media and attracted a crowd of 2900 – significantly higher than the average state league crowd. That match ended 1-1 and West Adelaide won the return leg at Adelaide City Park later in the season. The two clubs reached the final of the 2014 Federation Cup, which served as South Australia's qualifier to the inaugural FFA Cup. Adelaide City won the highly anticipated match 4–1 at Hindmarsh Stadium and went on to defeat Western Sydney Wanderers in the FFA Cup; becoming the first state league side to defeat an A-League club.
West Adelaide won its first championship since its return from bankruptcy the following season, despite a 4–0 loss to Adelaide City during the season. West also managed to knock City out of the cup, preventing the "Black and Whites" from embarking on a second FFA Cup campaign. Adelaide City responded by winning the next five derbies, including a 6-0 demolition in the final round of the 2017 FFSA season – the greatest ever winning margin in derby history.
Ahead of the first derby of the 2018 season, the clubs announced a perpetual trophy had been created to recognise the historical significance of the derby. Adelaide City defeated West Adelaide 4–0 at home on 17 March to claim the Real Adelaide Derby Cup.

Joye Hummel

Joye Evelyn Hummel (April 4, 1924April 5, 2021) was an American comic book author. She is noted for ghost-writing more than 70 "Wonder Woman" stories between 1944 and 1947.
Hummel was 19 years old when she began as a typist for the comic. She went on to write its scripts after William Moulton Marston fell ill, and stopped authoring the comics in the same year as his death three years later. Her contributions only became well-known in 2014 after she was interviewed for "The Secret History of Wonder Woman".
Early life.
Hummel was born on Long Island on April 4, 1924. Her parents were managers of a grocery store chain, and she was their only child. She attended high school in Freeport, New York, before studying at Middlebury College. After one year, she dropped out of college, intending to keep her mother company after her parents divorced.
Career.
Hummel attended the Katharine Gibbs secretarial school in Manhattan, graduating shortly after March 1944. There, she excelled in a psychology course taught by William Moulton Marston, the co-author of "Wonder Woman". He was swayed by the essays she wrote on a take-home exam, giving her the highest grades he had ever awarded to a student. He consequently employed her as his studio assistant after tea at the Harvard Club. At the time, Hummel had never read a comic book, let alone "Wonder Woman". She initially worked on typing out the scripts, before going on to writing over 70 of them. She was remunerated with $50 for every script she wrote.
When Marston became terminally ill with polio, Hummel took over. Her first story, titled "The Winged Maidens of Venus", appeared in the spring of 1945 in issue 12 of "Wonder Woman". Within three years of her in this writing role, the character became a major success. Hummel quit authoring "Wonder Woman" in late 1947 after her honeymoon, ostensibly to spend more time at home and care for her stepdaughter. She later revealed that she was aggrieved by how the comic's new writers eliminated much of the feminist themes championed by Marston, who had died earlier that year. She stated: "Even if I had not left because of my new daughter, I would have resigned if I was told I had to make [Wonder Woman] a masculine thinking and acting superwoman." She subsequently became a stockbroker.
Later recognition.
Hummel was the first woman to write stories for "Wonder Woman". At the time, she did not receive any recognition, since all of the initial comics were published under the pen name "Charles Moulton". Her contributions started to come to light after she was interviewed by Jill Lepore in 2014 for her book "The Secret History of Wonder Woman". Hummel was consequently contacted by the Smithsonian Institution, who asked her for the two packed binders containing the "Wonder Woman" issues she wrote. She also got in touch with Mark Evanier, who wanted to document the early years of comics. Hummel won the 2018 Bill Finger Award for Excellence in Comic Book Writing as a guest of honor at the San Diego Comic-Con International. This was conferred on comic book authors who go under the radar at the Eisner Awards, and is managed by Evanier.
Personal life.
Hummel married her first husband, David W. Murchison, in 1947. Together, they had two children: Robb and David Jr.; the latter predeceased her in 2015. Her husband died in 2000, and she married Jack Kelly two years later. They remained married until her death, and resided in Florida during their later years. She adopted the married name of Joye Murchison Kelly.
Hummel died on April 5, 2021, one day after her 97th birthday, at her home in Winter Haven, Florida.

Mad Dog Coll (1961 film)

Mad Dog Coll is a 1961 biographical movie directed by Burt Balaban. It marked Gene Hackman's film debut.
Plot.
The film is a heavily fictionalized treatment of the life of Vincent "Mad Dog" Coll Curran, who was born in 1908 in County Donegal, Ireland. In the film, Coll is depicted as growing up with an abusive father who beats and ridicules him (the film opens with him machine-gunning his father's gravestone), and started a street gang at a very young age, which led in turn to organized crime. He is portrayed as a psychopath, incapable of fear or compassion, who is never more happy than when he is recklessly shooting people with his tommy gun or feuding with the fellow mobster Dutch Schultz over whisky hijacking. The film ends with Coll being shot down by the police after Schultz puts a contract on him, but in fact he was arrested, tried, released, then later killed by associates of Lucky Luciano because he was making too much trouble for the syndicate. The incident where he allegedly was involved in the accidental shooting of a five-year-old boy (which led to his nickname in the press) is incorrectly associated with him shooting his way out of an attempt on his life (two boys hanging around the docks are killed), when in fact it happened as a result of a kidnapping he was accused of being part of. Dutch Schultz is depicted by Vincent Gardenia, who was 15 years older than Chandler—Coll was only seven years younger than Schultz.
Production.
Brook Hayward was cast in October 1960.
The film was distributed by Columbia.
Novelization.
In June, 1961, Monarch Books released a paperback novelization of the screenplay, by Frank Castle, writing under the pseudonym Steve Thurman. The cover featured a black-and-white still of the movie and an associate standing over the bedroom "rub-out" of a bullet-ridden married couple.
Reception.
The "New York Times" wrote that the film "belongs back in the pound."

Jordi Turull

Jordi Turull i Negre (born 6 September 1966) is a Spanish politician associated with Together for Catalonia. Since March 2018 he has been in pre-trial custody by order of the Supreme Court of Spain and accused of sedition and rebellion. On July 10, 2018 a Supreme Court judge suspended him as a deputy in the Catalan parliament.
Life and career.
Turull was born in Parets del Vallès, Spain. With a degree in law, he joined the Nationalist Youth of Catalonia in 1983 and Convergència Democràtica (CDC) in 1987. He was a councilor in the City Council of Parets del Vallès in 1987–2003, and headed the Convergència i Unió (CiU) list in the municipal elections of 1991, 1995 and 1999. He was a member of the Diputació de Barcelona in 1991–1996 and general director of the Catalan Institute of Volunteering between 1996–2000. He was the Regional President of CDC del Vallès Oriental in 2000–2004 and president of the CDC regional federation of Barcelona. He has also been an associate professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona.
Deputy in the Catalan Parliament since 2004, in 2010 he became spokesperson for the Convergència i Unió group in the Parliament of Catalonia and in March 2013 he was appointed as group president. He presided the research commission on the Fiscal Pact of the Parliament of Catalonia.
After the 2015 elections to the Parliament of Catalonia, he was elected president of the Junts pel Sí coalition. He held the position until July 14, 2017, when President Carles Puigdemont chose him as Councilor for Presidency and Government spokesman.
In the 2019 general election, Turull was elected member of the Congress of Deputies for the Province of Barcelona, being sworn in on 20 May 2019, but on 24 May, by a recommendation of the Supreme Court, the Board of the Congress suspended him and other imprisoned Catalan leaders. He also resigned as member of the Catalan Parliament on 18 May 2019.
Imprisonment.
On October 27, 2017 after the Parliament of Catalonia proclaimed the Catalan Republic, the Spanish Senate approved the measures proposed by the Spanish executive pursuant to Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978, including the dismissal of the President of the Generalitat of Catalonia and the entire executive, including Jordi Turull.
On November 2, 2017, eight members of the Catalan Government, including Jordi Turull, Oriol Junqueras, Josep Rull, Meritxell Borràs, Carles Mundó, Raül Romeva, Dolors Bassa, Joaquim Forn and ex-minister Santi Vila, gave testimony before the Spanish Audiencia Nacional general court. The prosecutor, Miguel Ángel Carballo, requested unconditional jail for all members of the Catalan Government, including Jordi Turull, which was subsequently decreed by the magistrate, Carmen Lamela. On December 4, Turull was released on bail after his case passed to the Supreme Court.
On December 21, Turull was re-elected to the Parliament with the list of Together for Catalonia in new elections. After the failed attempts to propose Carles Puigdemont or Jordi Sànchez for the presidency, on March 21, 2018, Turull was proposed for president. The investiture took place on March 22, 2018, and the parliamentarians rejected Turull's candidacy for President of the Generalitat with 65 votes against, 64 in favor and 4 abstentions.
One day later, on March 23, 2018, the magistrate of the Spanish High Court, Tribunal Supremo, Pablo Llarena sent him back to prison, together with the former president of Parliament Carme Forcadell and the ministers Raül Romeva, Josep Rull and Dolors Bassa. Llarena argued for unconditional provisional bail after considering that was a risk of flight and reiteration of the crimes for which they were prosecuted. In July 2018, he was transferred to a prison in Catalonia. Between December 1 and 21 2018, Turull and Jordi Sànchez started a hunger strike in order to 'raise awareness' of unfair treatment by Spain and to denounce that Spanish courts are refusing to process numerous appeals in relation to their cases.
On February 1, 2019, he was transferred back to a prison in Madrid, expecting trial that started February the 12th and ended and was remitted to decision on 12 June 2019.
On 14 October 2019 he was sentenced to a 12 years of prison term and disqualification for the sedition and misuse of public funds crimes. He was freed in June 2021 following a government pardon.

The Hangman's Whip

The Hangman's Whip is an American mystery novel by Mignon G. Eberhart. It was published by Doubleday (publisher) in 1940 and would be the last of Eberhart's novels with the company before moving to Random House.
Plot.
A young Chicago socialite named Search Abbott still carries a torch for Richard Bohan, an old flame who has since married. Declining the marriage proposal of another man, Search is reunited with Richard, who promises that his marriage is over. When Richard's covetous wife Eve turns up dead, however, everyone but Search naturally assumed that Richard is to blame. 
Reception.
The book received mostly positive reviews. Isaac Anderson's "New York Times" review said of "The Hangman's Whip": "The suspense in this story mounts steadily from the beginning to the dramatic climax. Mignon Eberhart, who has written many excellent mystery stories, has seldom, if ever, produced one better than "The Hangman's Whip"." 
Eberhart herself was extremely critical of the first edition dust jacket, describing it as "hideous" in her private correspondence.

Murder of Sherry Ann Duncan

The murder of Sherry Ann Duncan was a sensational crime that occurred in 1986 in Thailand. It is best known for the false incrimination of four suspects, some of whom died in prison during their nine years of incarceration, before being acquitted in 1995.
Duncan, a sixteen-year-old half-Thai/American student, was abducted after leaving her school in Bangkok on 22 July 1986; her body was found a few days later in wetlands in Samut Prakan Province. Four men were arrested, eventually convicted of murder, and sentenced to death in 1990. Later re-investigations by the Crime Suppression Division found evidence of false testimony by a key witness, and that the men had made forced confessions under duress. The convictions were overturned by the Supreme Court in 1995, but by then one of the wrongly accused men had died in prison, one had sustained permanent spinal injuries, and another died from tuberculosis shortly after release.
Two men were arrested and convicted for the murder. They implicated Suwiboon Patpongpanit for hiring them; she was convicted by the Court of First Instance but later acquitted by the Supreme Court in 1999 due to insufficient evidence. The police officer who led the original investigation, Police Colonel Mongkol Sripho, was retroactively dishonourably discharged for fabricating evidence, but he had already retired and emigrated to the United States, and was not brought to face criminal charges.
In 2003, the Civil Court awarded the scapegoats and/or their descendants 26 million baht in damages. The case is often raised as an example of police corruption and the problems facing Thailand's justice system. It was adapted into a film (titled "Sherry Ann" and directed by Charoon Wattanasin) by Five Star Production in 2001.

Kettenhofweg 124/124a

Kettenhofweg 124/124a is a listed semi-detached house from the early 20th century. The house on the Kettenhofweg in Frankfurt's Westend district was, in 1994, the scene of a sixfold murder whilst the house was being used as a brothel. The house stood empty for a while after the murders until it was brought by a Viennese real estate company. It is now occupied by an investment company.
The building.
The building is a neo-Baroque style double tenement with a rich, partially sculpted stone façade and overhanging side risalits. The building is partly original. It was built in 1902.
Brothel.
In 1977, the house was brought by Hungarian businessman Gabor Bartos and his German wife Ingrid. The couple lived in the ground floor, and in the converted cellar and on the first and second floors, they operated an exclusive brothel. The cellar consisted of a make-up room, a meeting room where the prostitutes were presented to clients, a sauna and a locker room. 
Many of the clients were from business, politics, authorities and from the judiciary. New clients were only accepted on the recommendation of existing clients. Ingrid Bartos also owned a stationery store in Frankfurt and would issue receipts for stationery to brothel customers so they could claim their visit against expenses. The prostitutes were mainly from Hungary, Estonia and the CIS countries.
Murders.
On August 15, 1994, the owners and four Russian prostitutes were found murdered. The body of Gabor Bartos was found in the sauna, strangled from behind, the bodies of his wife Ingrid and Marina Erokina were found in other rooms in the basement. Veronika Sorokina and Yelena Starikova were found dead on the first floor and Olga Lucina on the 2nd. All had been strangled with electrical flex. 
Initially the Russian mafia were suspected of the murders. Sofia Berwald, a Moldovan former prostitute in the brothel and her husband Eugen Berwald (born Yevgeny Balakin in Moldova) were detained as suspects. Police later established the murders occurred when Gabor Bartos returned from walking his dog to find Eugen and Sofia Berwald robbing the brothel. Eugen Berwald was sentenced to life imprisonment for sixfold murders, his wife Sofia was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment for robbery.
Frieda Vogel wrote a novel "Todesengel über Frankfurt : ein Psychothriller über die Bordell-Morde im Kettenhofweg" (Death angel over Frankfurt: a psychological thriller about the brothel murders in Kettenhofweg) based on the murders.

List of Parliamentary constituencies in the North East (region)

The region of North East England is divided into 29 parliamentary constituencies which is made up of 19 Borough Constituencies and 10 County Constituencies. Since the 2019 general election, 19 are represented by Labour MPs and 10 by Conservative MPs.
Proposed boundary changes.
The Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before Parliament they were not brought forward by the Government for approval. Accordingly, they did not come into effect for the 2019 election which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.
Under the terms of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.
On 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Chloe Smith, issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. Subsequently, the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020 was passed into law on 14 December 2020. This formally removed the duty to implement the 2018 review and set out the framework for future boundary reviews. The Act provided that the number of constituencies should remain at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.
The Act specified that the next review should be completed no later than 1 July 2023 and the Boundary Commission formally launched the 2023 Review on 5 January 2021. The Commission have calculated that the number of seats to be allocated to the North East region will decrease by two, from 29 to 27.
See 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies for further details.

Villa Croce in its current appearance was remodeled in the neoclassical style in the 19th century for Giovanni Giacomo Croce, modifying a preexisting 17th-century villa which belonged to the Spinola family. It was donated in 1951 to the Municipality to be transformed into a museum.
Opened in 1985, the Museum exhibits a permanent collection of Italian and international contemporary art, gathered by Maria Cernuschi Ghiringhelli, wife of the Italian painter and art collector Gino Ghiringhelli. From 2012, it is managed through a cooperation between public and private funds, involving the Municipality of Genoa, the Palazzo Ducale Foundation and a group of private supporters. From June 2012 to December 2017, the curator of the Museum was Ilaria Bonacossa. From January 2018, the curator of the Museum is Carlo Antonelli.

Malt tax

A malt tax is a tax upon the making or sale of Malted grain, which has been prepared using a process of steeping and drying to encourage germination and the conversion of its starch into sugars. Used in the production of beer and whisky for centuries, it is also an ingredient in modern foods.
Background.
Until the late 19th century, lack of access to clean drinking water meant particularly in urban areas, it was often safer to drink so-called small beer. These had relatively low levels of alcohol and were routinely drunk throughout the day by both workers and children; in 1797, one educationalist suggested for '...more robust children, water is preferable, and for the weaker ones, small beer ...'. 
This meant malt was seen as an essential part of dietary health for the poor and taxing it caused widespread dissent.
Taxation.
In England, malt was first taxed in 1644 by the Crown to help finance the English Civil War.
Article 14 of the 1707 Acts of Union between England and Scotland agreed the malt tax would not be applicable in Scotland until the conclusion of the 1701-1713 War of the Spanish Succession. After the Peace of Utrecht in April 1713, Parliament voted to extend the tax, despite protests from the 45 Scots Members of Parliament, which reflected general discontent on the impact of Union. At a meeting with Queen Anne on 26 May, a deputation that included the Earl of Mar and Duke of Argyll asked her to dissolve the Union, which was refused.
According to William Cobbett, this tax contributed to inequality, poverty, and malnutrition in England, as it created a monopoly for malting and brewing, preventing ordinary householders from brewing their own nutritious beer for everyday use.

Chapel of the Prophet Elias, Mount Olympus

Near the summits of Mount Olympus lies the chapel of the Prophet Elias (Greek: εξωκκλήσι του Προφήτη Ηλία). The Orthodox Church celebrates the saint on July 20.
Location.
The peak of Profitis Ilias (Προφήτης Ηλίας) is located near the highest peaks of Mount Olympus (Mytikas and Stefani). The closest mountain huts are the Apostolidis Hut (430 meters away) and the Christos Kakkalos Hut (around 600 meters away).
History.
Saint Dionysius, founder of the Monastery of the Holy Trinity (nowadays known as Monastery Agios Dionysios), also founded the chapel of the Prophet Elias in the 16th century. It was built on the ruins of an ancient structure. Dionysus, who practised an ascetic life, is said to have lived in the church at times. The chapel is the highest ecclesiastical building of the Orthodox Church worldwide.
The building.
The chapel was built on the top of Mount Profitis Ilias; the main building materials were the surrounding stones. The floor of the chapel is covered with stone slabs, the outer walls are made of layered stones, without further connecting material. Covered with stone slabs, the roof is supported by a solid wooden construction to support the snow load. An atrium is protected on the eastern and southern sides by a natural stone wall, which has an entrance on the north side. The low entrance to the chapel is on the south side of the building. 
Inside hang some icons; a small altar, framed by icons depicting saints of the Orthodox Church, gives believers the opportunity to light a candle.

Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact

The Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact is an Android smartphone manufactured and marketed by Sony. Part of the Xperia X series, the device was announced to the public along with the Xperia XZ2 at a press conference held at the annual 2018 Mobile World Congress event on February 26, 2018.
Hardware.
Design and Build.
The Xperia XZ2 Compact comes with the new "Ambient Flow" design, replacing the outdated "OmniBalance" that had been in use since 2013 with curvy corners. It consists of a new 7000-series aluminum alloy chassis that has a curved edge all around the device, plastic back, and 2.5D scratch-resistant front and made of Corning's Gorilla Glass 5, resulting in a symmetric and curvier design aesthetic. The most defining change in the Xperia XZ2 Compact, as well as the Xperia XZ2 Premium and XZ2, is the placement of the camera on the back. It is now symmetrically arranged on the top-center of the device, as opposed to being placed on the top left side like on previous Xperia smartphones. The NFC antenna is placed along the Triple Image Sensing System, the MotionEye camera module and the now US-enabled fingerprint sensor (except on Verizon), symmetrically aligned near the top-center axis of the device. The front houses the improved dual front-firing stereo speakers, one on the top bezel along with a 5 MP front camera, ambient light and proximity sensor and notification LED, and the other on the bottom bezel in an elongated slit along the edge of the glass and frame.
The Xperia XZ2 Compact's dimensions are in height, with a width of and a depth of and weighs approximately . The device comes in 4 colors: Liquid Black, Liquid Silver, Deep Green and Ash Pink.
Performance.
The Xperia XZ2 Compact is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845, built on a 10 nm process technology with 8 custom Kryo 385 processors (4x 2.7 GHz and 4x 1.7 GHz), 4/6 GB of LPDDR4X RAM and uses the Adreno 630 for graphics rendering. The device also has an internal storage of 64 GB and comes in single-SIM and dual-SIM versions, with both featuring LTE Cat. 16 with 3x carrier aggregation, a 4x4 MIMO antenna design with a total of 8 antennas. It also has microSD card expansion of up to 512 GB in a hybrid SIM 2 slot setup.
Camera.
MotionEye.
Sony debuted in the Xperia XZs and the XZ Premium the world's first three-layer stacked image sensor with DRAM for smartphones. Known as the Sony IMX400, the sensor features a RAM chip sandwiched in between the sensor and control circuitry layers which serves as a large and fast buffer to where the sensor can temporarily offload a significant amount of captured data before transferring it to the phone's internal memory for processing. This enables the camera to record super slow-motion videos at 960 fps, at a steady 720p resolution. Recording at super slow motion is limited to 0.18 seconds per buffer though, due to limitations.
The Xperia XZ2 Compact borrows the Motion Eye Camera from the Xperia XZ Premium and Xperia XZ1. It comprises a 19 MP 1/2.3” Exmor RS for mobile sensor with a 1.22 μm pixel pitch, f/2.0 aperture and 25 mm wide G Lens. It also features 4K HDR video recording, a world's first for Sony, which supports SteadyShot video stabilization alongside the standard 1080p/30 fps, a high-speed 1080p/60 fps and a 120 fps recording in 720p options. The front selfie camera has a 5-megapixel sensor (1/5") with 23 mm, f/2.2 lens, a 90-degree wide angle lens and SteadyShot with Intelligent Active Mode (5-axis stabilization).
Triple Image Sensing technology.
The Xperia XZ2 Compact has the Triple Image Sensing technology that started with the Xperia XZ as standard. It is composed of the image sensing (CMOS sensor with PDAF), distance sensing (Laser AF sensor) and color sensing (RGBC-IR sensor) systems, featuring a hybrid autofocus that utilizes Phase Detection (PDAF) to lock focus on a subject within 0.03 seconds, and also includes phase and contrast detection along with predictive motion tracking. It also has a laser autofocus sensor for fast tracking and locking focus on a subject, as well as an RGBC-IR ("RedGreenBlueClear-InfraRed") color sensor that assists the white balance function of the camera by providing additional data about the light conditions of the surrounding environment. It also has SteadyShot with Intelligent Auto in addition to the five-axis sensor-shift image stabilization first seen in the Xperia XZ. The Motion Eye Camera in the Xperia XZ2 Compact also has "Predictive Capture". When it detects fast-paced movement, the camera automatically captures a maximum of four photos before the shutter button is pressed, and lets the user select the best one afterwards. This is done without any user intervention and is possible due to the same built-in RAM chip on the image sensor used in capturing the 960 fps super slow-motion videos.
3D Creator.
The Xperia XZ2 Compact is also capable of capturing 3D objects without the need of a dual-camera setup, a feature that was first implemented into the Xperia XZ1. It utilizes the IMX400's built-in DRAM to offload captured data before being combined and built up in the proprietary 3D Creator application, creating a near-perfect rendition of the subject, be it a face of a person, a whole head or any object the user may wish to capture. The user is then given the option to use the rendered 3D image on the included animated figures for a more creative approach or have it 3D-printed by Sony's approved 3D printing companies, all within the app itself.
Battery.
The Xperia XZ2 Compact is powered by a non-removable 2870 mAh battery. Charging and data transfer is handled by a USB-C port with support for USB 3.1. It also has Qualcomm's QuickCharge 3.0 and Qnovo adaptive charging technology built-in. This allows the device to monitor the cell's electrochemical processes in real time and adjust charging parameters accordingly to minimize cell damage and extend the battery unit's lifespan.
Battery Care.
The Xperia XZ2 Compact also comes with Battery Care, Sony's proprietary charging algorithm that controls the charging process of the phone through machine learning. It recognizes the user's charging habits for a certain period and automatically adjusts itself to the pattern, for example an overnight charge, by stopping the initial charging to about 80-90 percent, and then continuing it until full from where it left off the next day. This effectively prevents the unnecessary damage to the battery's cells from excessive heat and current due to overcharging, further increasing the battery's life span.
Audio and Connectivity.
The Xperia XZ2 Compact is the first Xperia device that has no standard 3.5 mm audio jack, which has resulted in a somewhat mixed reaction from users and critics alike. To make up for the removal, the XZ2 Compact has improved wireless audio connectivity along with Sony's LDAC, an audio coding technology they developed, which is now a part of the Android Open Source Project, that enables the transmission of 24bit/96 kHz High-Resolution (Hi-Res) audio content over Bluetooth at up to 990 kbit/s, three times faster than conventional audio streaming codecs, to compatible audio devices.
Other connectivity options include Bluetooth 5 with aptX and Low Energy, NFC, 4x4 MIMO antennas for fast Wi-Fi and cellular upload/download speeds, dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, Wi-Fi Direct, MirrorLink, screen casting via Miracast and Google Cast, DLNA, GPS (with A-GPS), GLONASS, BeiDou and Galileo satellite positioning. The Xperia XZ2 Compact, like most new smartphone nowadays, has no FM radio.
Software.
The Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact launched with the Android 8.0 Oreo operating system, along with Smart Stamina battery saving modes and Sony's proprietary multimedia apps. Android Pie started rolling out in OTA updates on October 12, 2018. Android 10 arrived to Xperia XZ2 Compact on January 6, 2020.
Successor.
The flagship Sony Xperia XZ3, announced in August 2018, did not have a compact variant as previous flagship models have had since 2014. In May 2019 the Sony Xperia Ace (SO-02L) was introduced exclusively for Japan and the NTT Docomo carrier, which has been called the true "compact" successor of the XZ2 Compact. Unlike the XZ2 Compact, the Ace has a 3.5 mm headphone jack.
In 2019 Sony announced, that the whole hi-end "Xperia compact" series was dropped and discontinued, making XZ2c the last such product: The further "compact" phones are just the mid-class level.

Ngawait

The Ngawait, also spelt Ngawadj and other variations, and also known as Eritark and other names, were an Aboriginal Australian people of the mid-Riverland region, spanning the Murray River in South Australia. They have sometimes been referred to as part of the Meru people, a larger grouping which could also include the Ngaiawang and Erawirung peoples. There were at least two clans or sub-groups of the Ngawait people, the Barmerara Meru and Muljulpero maru.
Country.
In Norman Tindale's estimation, the Ngawait had approximately of tribal land. They were one of the Murray River tribes, situated between Boggy Flat and Penn Reach, running to the vicinity of Loxton. They were also on the western side of the Lake Bonney. Their purchase on the Murray was between Nildottie and Devon Downs, at a place known as "Wutjuwati".
Defined by the Ngawait language, the group's traditional lands are in the upper reaches of the Murray within South Australia. There are a number of dialect groups, such as the Barmerara Meru group at Barmera.
Their traditional lands were bordered on the west by the Ngaiawang and on the east by Erawirung peoples.
Social organisation.
The Ngawait were composed of sub-groups or clans, of which at least two are known:
Language.
They spoke the Ngawait language.
Initiation ceremony.
Edward Eyre was on hand to describe the rites of passages among the Ngawait which ushered in youths to full manhood. His account is summarized by R. H. Mathews in the following passage:-
When one of these tribes neared the appointed place of meeting the men of the tribe who had sent out the invitation sat down in a row to receive them. The novices, painted with red ochre and grease, sat behind the men, and the women sat behind the novices. The new mob now approached-the men painted and carrying their weapons, the women and children being the rear, separate from the men, and a little on one strangers halted, and some of their women singled out of the rest and stood between the two tribes. These women then threw down their cloaks and bags and raised a loud wail, accompanied by frantic gesticulations, lacerating their bodies with sharp shells till the blood flowed from the wounds. After some time had been spent in this way the women took up their bundles again and returned to the rear of their own party.An elderly man of the Narwijjerook people now advanced and held a short colloquy with the local mob. He then stepped back and brought his own men forward, exhibiting in front three uplifted spears, to which were attached the little nets left with them by the envoys already referred to, and which were the emblems of the duty they had to perform. The men of the Moorundie tribe now rose to their feet with a suppressed shout. The new arrivals then speared fifteen or sixteen of the local men in the left arm a little below the shoulder, the latter holding out their arms for the purpose of receiving the wounds. The Narwijjerooks then withdrew about a hundred yards and camped.
When all the tribes had arrived the date was fixed for carrying out the ceremonies. Early in the morning of the appointed day the novices were mustered out of the camp and ran away a short distance, where they were captured and thrown down. They were next raised up and surrounded by several natives, who held them while they were painted from head to foot with red ochre and grease. The mothers and other relatives then surrounded the group of men, crying and lamenting and lacerating their bodies with sharp shells or flints. When the painting of the novices was completed they were led away by their guardians to a little distance and placed, sitting down, on green bushes brought for the purpose. If they were permitted to move from where they were sitting, they had to hold a bunch of green boughs in each hand. Close to this place the three spears, with the nets attached, already mentioned, were stuck in a row in the ground. Three men then went and seated themselves at the foot of the three spears, with their legs crossed. Two men proceeded to where the novices were and, seizing each in succession by the legs and shoulders, carefully lifted them from the ground and carried them and laid them on their backs at full length on green boughs spread upon the ground in front of the three men sitting by the spears, so that the head of each novice rested on the lap of one of the three men. The novices kept their eyes closed all this while and pretended to be in a trance.
A cloak was then thrown over each novice and a man, selected from a distant tribe, came quietly up and sat down beside him, and, lifting up the cloak, commenced plucking the hair from the pubes. At intervals the operators were relieved by others of both sexes. When all the hair had been pulled out, that of each novice was carefully rolled up in green boughs, all the lots being put together and given to one of the old men to take care of. Bunches of green boughs were now placed under the arms and in the hands of each novice, after which several natives took hold of them, raising them suddenly and simultaneously to their feet, while a loud, guttural " whaugh ! " was uttered by the other natives standing around. The heads and bodies of the novices were then rubbed over with grease and red ochre, and tufts of feathers and kangaroo teeth were worn tied to the hair in front.

Jeffrey Kopstein

Jeffrey Kopstein (born 1962) is an American social scientist who specializes in interethnic violence, anti-liberal tendencies, and minority voting patterns with a focus on Jewish history in Russia and Europe. Kopstein received his PhD at University of California, Berkeley in 1991, subsequently held various positions at University of Colorado Boulder until 2002, subsequently at University of Toronto where he was a full processor until 2015, and from 2015 at University of California, Irvine, where he is Professor and Chair of Political Science.
Kopstein's recent research has focused on why Jews were massacred by the local populations in Eastern Europe during 1941 (in some 10 percent of localities), while in other localities the locals did not kill Jews on a wide scale despite the German encouragement. According to Kopstein, polarization within the community was a necessary prerequisite for a massacre.
According to Kopstein, research conducted inside and outside of Poland has established the complicity of some Poles in the Holocaust for instance in the Szczuczyn pogrom. Kopstein has called the 2018 Polish amendment to the Act on the Institute of National Remembrance an attempt to outlaw historical facts, as those who publish or publicly present scholarly findings on the complicity of Poles in the Holocaust would be risk a fine or imprisonment.

Time Served

Time Served is a 1999 R-rated American prison film directed by Glen Pitre and starring Catherine Oxenberg, Jeff Fahey, Louise Fletcher, James Handy, and Bo Hopkins.
Foreign-language versions were produced in German ("Ausgebeutet - Hölle hinter Gittern"), in Spanish ("Condenada sin ley"), in Italian ("Dietro le sbarre"), and in Hungarian ("Leszolgált idő").
Plot.
Sarah McKinney (Catherine Oxenberg) is a nurse married to an abusive alcoholic. When he beats up both Sarah and their eight-year-old son Jason (Zach Gray), the boy uses his father's gun to shoot him dead. Sarah then claims to have pulled the trigger herself, and her attorney, Patrick Burlington (Jeff Fahey) warns her that she faces Judge William T. Engstrom III (James Handy), known as "Maximum Bill" for his long sentences. Convicted and sent to the Women's State Correctional Facility, she suffers lesbian assaults and Warden Mildred Reinecke (Louise Fletcher) bullies her into joining the work release program. This proves to be a strip club, where Sarah and the prisoners' services are enjoyed by none other than Judge Engstrom and his friends. Sarah sets out to blow the whistle, but being a helpless prisoner in the system has her at a disadvantage.
Production.
The picture was filmed in the summer of 1998 in Chicago, Berwyn, and Melrose Park, all in Illinois.
It was R-rated for adult situations, language, nudity, and violence. "VideoHound" called it a "typically sleazy women-in-prison movie".

Tsaiorchis keiskeoides

Tsaiorchis keiskeoides is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, native to northern Vietnam.
Taxonomy.
The species was first described in 1931 by François Gagnepain, as "Habenaria keiskeoides". It was transferred to the genus "Amitostigma" in 1985. A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 treated "Habenaria keiskoides" as synonymous with "Tsaiorchis neottianthoides". Although "Tsaiorchis" was shown to be close to some other genera, including "Ponerorchis" when expanded to include "Amitostigma", it was regarded as sufficiently distinct to be maintained as a separate genus. Sources such as the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families treat "Tsaiorchis keiskeoides" as a distinct species from "Tsaiorchis neottianthoides".

Arnold Majewski

Karl Arnold Woldemar Majewski (, Tallinn – 10 October 1942, Rukajärvi) was a legendary Finnish cavalry officer of Polish origin. 
He was a colourful person and the subject of many jokes.
Family and early life.
The family roots of Arnold Majewski can be traced back to his grandfather Wladislaus Majewski (1828 - 1873) who originated from the Warsaw Governorate, had a long military career in the army of the Russian Empire and then settled in Finland through marriage.
Arnold Majewski's father Alexander Majewski, who originated from an old Polish family of soldiers, served in Imperial Russian Army and finally settled to live in Helsinki. Arnold Majewski's mother was the Finnish Irene Hellman.
Majewski studied in 1912 in Turku. After matriculation, Majewski had had enough of school and travelled to Siberia in search for gold, and then travelled across the Far East and North America until finally settling in St. Petersburg in Russia.
Finnish Civil War.
When the Finnish Civil War started, Majewski moved back to Finland. He fought in the civil war as a volunteer in the White Army cavalry under Georg Elfvengren of Karelian Forces. He took part in fights at Vyborg, Terijoki and Rautu.
After the war he continued his military career, completed officer training in Joensuu and became a cavalry captain. In the 1920s and 1930s, Majewski served in Häme Regiment in Lappeenranta. He became head of squadron in 1926, and completed the commander course in 1929. By that time, Majewski, nicknamed "Mäski" among his comrades, was already famous for his bohemian lifestyle and extravagant partying during his free time.
Marriage.
In 1941, Majewski married pharmacist Helga Sonck-Majewski (née Sonck, born 26 December 1916 in Tallinn - died 12 March 2015 in Porvoo). The marriage did not result in children.
Majewski is said to have contemplated between Helga Sonck and another woman who worked as bank clerk. He is said to have pondered: "I have two girlfriends, of which one is a pharmacist and the other is a bank clerk at Yhdyspankki. If I choose the pharmacist, I will never run out of alcohol, but if I choose the bank clerk, I will never run out of credit." In the end, the pharmacist won.
Second World War.
In the Winter War Majewski served in Ladoga Karelia and fought in the Battle of Kollaa. He was the youngest battalion commander in Finnish forces, and quickly became known as daredevil officer who was never afraid to expose himself to enemy fire.
After the Winter War Majewski was promoted to Major. There was even a proposal to award him the Mannerheim Cross First Class, which has only been awarded twice: to Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim himself and to General Erik Heinrichs, but nothing ever came from this proposal.
In the Continuation War, Majewski was famous for his 100 km winter raid to Mai Guba (north of Sekehe) behind the Soviet lines in January 1942.
Because of his Polish background and travels around the world in his youth, Majewski's command of the Finnish language was not perfect, which gave further colour to stories told about him. At the start of the raid to Mai Guba Majewski gave the following description of the mission to his troops, which later became famous:
Majewski was hit by shrapnels and badly wounded just before the end of the war. He was promoted after the end of the Winter War.
In the Continuation War he fought at Rukajärvi front, where he earned a reputation as one of the bravest commanders. He was promoted as Lieutenant Colonel in April 1942.
On 10 October 1942 Majewski was killed in action in Peukalonniemi when he was presenting the position of his battalion to the TK companies after the Finns had resisted an attack from a Soviet battalion. As Majewski was counting the Soviet dead, he carelessly peeked over the edge of the trench and was immediately shot by a Soviet sniper.
Majewski was buried in the Majewski family grave at the Turku Cemetery.

Haval H8

The Haval H8 is a mid-size SUV produced by Haval, a sub-brand of Great Wall Motors. 
Overview.
The Haval H8 was previewed on the April 2012 Beijing Auto Show as the Great Wall Haval H7 concept, the production version was revealed on the Chinese car market during the 2013 Guangzhou Auto Show. Comparisons were drawn with the current Holden Captiva/Daewoo Winstrom - further exacerbating the notion that Chinese car companies simply copy and pasted models from other car brands currently on sale. Criticism quickly surfaced arguing of all cars to duplicate, why the Chinese would choose the much maligned Captiva. Pricing of the Haval H8 SUV ranges from 183,800 to 231,800 yuan. The chassis of the H8 is a uni-body, while suspension in the front is double-wishbone independent with the rear being multi-link independent. Drive train options include both 4×2 and 4×4.
The Haval H8 is powered by a 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine making 160kW at 5500rpm and 324Nm between 2000 and 4000rpm. The engine is mated to a ZF six-speed automatic gearbox. The torque is directed to the rear wheels by default, with a transfer case by Borg-Warner sending up to 50 per cent of torque to the front wheels when needed.

Despite his flaws, Nick is a very intelligent young man, and is shown to care for his immediate family and eventually the family of his mother's boyfriend Travis after some reluctance. He is quite intelligent and quick thinking, such as being the first member of the group to realize that the infected aren't infected, but rather dead, going as far as to prevent Alicia from visiting Matt, as he knew he would already be dead and attack her. However he can be selfish at times, such as taking Griselda Salazar's oxycontin which she was using due to her injury.

Liza is first seen when she meets up with her ex-husband Travis and their son Chris. A riot erupts after police shoot down another zombie, but the three Manawas find refuge with the Salazars. While a riot rages outside, a mob sets fire to the store adjoining the barbershop, forcing the Salazars and Manawas to flee. The group reaches Travis' truck and escapes, but not before Griselda is injured by a collapsing scaffold. Unable to reach a hospital, the group drives to Madison's house. All three families decide to stay the night and evacuate in the morning. Liza tends to Griselda's injured foot but notes that Griselda will die if not treated by a doctor. The next morning, as the Clarks and Manawas start driving away, the National Guard arrives and quarantines the block. While Travis says, "It's going to get better," Daniel laments that it's, "too late," as he watches a guardsman mark the neighboring house. Days after the National Guard quarantines the neighborhood into a Safe Zone, residents try to live normally. Tensions build under the military rule. Dr. Exner determines that Liza is not technically a nurse. The US Navy takes Griselda and Nick to a hospital. Liza agrees to go to assist the medical team, despite not wanting to leave her son. Liza helps Dr. Exner with patients at the hospital. Chris is devastated that Liza left voluntarily to help at the hospital, but Travis promises to bring her back. Travis convinces Moyers' squad to take him to the hospital to check on his friends. Griselda dies of septic shock at the hospital; Liza shoots her brain to prevent reanimation.

They try to escape through the medical ward, where they discover Dr. Exner has euthanized all of the patients. Dr. Exner tells them of an escape route before presumably committing suicide. Strand leads the group to his oceanside mansion. On the beach, Liza reveals to Madison that she had been bitten during the escape.

The group holds a funeral for Liza and buries her at sea. However, Chris reacts violently and blames Travis for her death.

Chris Manawa.
Chris Manawa, portrayed by Lorenzo James Henrie, is the teenage son of Travis Manawa and Liza Ortiz. Christopher was shown to be a normal, highly intelligent teenager before the apocalypse occurred, though he did appear to be extremely angered at his father for leaving and seemed to hold this against him for the rest of his life. Chris slowly adapted to the apocalypse in the beginning and retained his kind side, though after the death of his mother, he is shown to be even more angered and traumatized. But later on during the apocalypse, Chris takes a dramatic turn for the worst and is shown to be angered at his father, distant from everyone and has turned into a noticeably colder individual.

His training and survival skills have shaped him into a formidable combatant. He is highly adept with firearms and hands to hand combat. Daniel is also shown to be a skilled torturer with extensive knowledge of interrogation techniques and is willing, albeit reluctantly, to use this skill when he feel it is necessary to survive, as seen when he brutally tortured Andrew Adams. Daniel however does not appear to be pleased with the past atrocities he has committed or was forced to commit, and regrets being the monster that he was forced to become. Despite his murderous past, Daniel has demonstrated that he cares about his family more than anything else and is a loving husband and father who vowed to give his daughter the best life possible. Daniel was shown to be devastated by the loss of his beloved wife, the anchor that kept him stable. He subsequently came unhinged for a time and nearly killed himself. Daniel is extremely cautious around those he does not trust, such as Victor Strand and appears to be highly skilled at identifying a potential threat. While under the leadership of Dante Esquivel, Daniel briefly re-embraces his cruel nature but ultimately turns on Dante and his men, saving his allies from certain death, demonstrating that he will never harm the innocent again and that he is ready to kill a threat without any hesitation.
In December 2018, it was reported that Rubén Blades would return in season 5 as Daniel Salazar.
Victor Strand.
Victor Strand, portrayed by Colman Domingo, is a mysterious character who has acquired great personal wealth as immediately indicated by his suit and jewelry, then later by his gated coast-side estate, Aston Martin and luxury yacht, the Abigail.

It is unknown how long he was imprisoned at the temporary hospital set up in Raynard Community College before Nick arrived. He is calm and does not panic when confronting the walkers, even when he was trapped at the end of a locked corridor as a herd approached. He appears to have adapted quickly to the new world, telling Nicholas Clark that the only way to survive a mad world is to embrace the madness. Victor has a good sense of judgement, believing that Nick has the skills to survive, identifying his heroin addiction as a precursor to the behavior necessary for survival. Strand later joined Madison and her group.
Alex.

After the plane crashed, she went to great lengths to protect a severely injured Jake from dying, decisively killing two passengers who tried to harm him.
Alex is first seen swimming to her wounded companion, Jake, after Flight 462 crashed into the middle of ocean. She brings Jake to a raft with other survivors. Tom, one of the survivors, smacks an infected passenger with an oar and pushes him overboard. Tom warns Alex that Jake is dying and urges her to kill him before he turns. That night, Alex stabs Tom when he tries to kill Jake in his sleep. Michael, the remaining survivor, encourages Alex to put Jake out of his misery. A week later, Alex is then seen running over a dune away from a herd of walkers, yelling at Daniel that the herd are coming. The two begin to make their way back to the group. When the survivors are surrounded, Alex helps in fighting them off until they are pushed to the edge of a cliff. When Nick rescues the group while camouflaged in walker gore, they make for the Zodiac boat on the shore. When they finally made it onto the water, Alex tells them they need to make a stop, to retrieve Jake and the raft. When they make it to Abigail, Strand refuses to let them on board, so the others allow the raft to be towed behind Abigail, also supplied with some fresh water and towels. While sailing, Alex comforts a severely injured Jake by telling him it can not get worse than it already is. As the sun is setting, Strand suddenly dashes to the stern and swiftly hacks the rope attaching the raft, abandoning Alex and Jake in the middle of the ocean.

Nick begins to observe Luciana's community, and is shocked to see Luciana's people banish an infected man, where he voluntarily allows himself to be eaten by walkers. Luciana explains that those who are infected or terminally ill sacrifice themselves to help build the "Wall", a barrier of walkers meant to protect the community from outside threats. Nick then accompanies Luciana on a supply run to a nearby supermarket, which is controlled by an armed gang. Nick is caught trying to shoplift, but he manages to bargain for his life and more supplies by threatening to cut off the supply of medicine the community has been trading with the gang. Luciana scolds Nick for his recklessness, as now the gang will be interested in finding out where her community is. Nick is then brought before the community's leader, Alejandro, who explains to Nick that he keeps the community together by preaching that the undead plague is merely a test from God, and those that survive will inherit the Earth. To preserve their dwindling medicine supplies, Nick proposes to Alejandro that they trick the bandits they promised to trade medicine to by secretly diluting it with powdered milk. Alejandro is impressed with Nick's ingenuity and accepts him fully into his community by giving him his own house. He also confirms to Nick that he had been bitten by a walker and somehow did not turn. However, one of the community's scouts returns and reports that Luciana's brother Pablo has been killed.

Pope's Urn

Pope's Urn, on Champion's Wharf at Twickenham riverside in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, is a contemporary piece of public art inspired by the poetry of 18th-century Twickenham resident Alexander Pope, who is buried in the parish church that overlooks the wharf. It consists of a stylised urn on a pedestal, both made in corten steel and standing just over eight-foot (2.5 metres) high, surrounded by wooden benches inscribed with aphorisms written by Pope. It was commissioned to celebrate the 2015 Rugby World Cup, for which Twickenham Stadium was one of the venues, and was opened in a ceremony on 21 September 2015.
"Pope's Urn" was the initiative of Twickenham resident Graham Henderson as public art consultant for the London-based arts charity Poet in the City. Henderson conceived the project and worked in partnership with Richmond upon Thames Council, and the architectural design practice Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios, to design, build and install it. It was unveiled by Lord True, Leader of Richmond Council, in a ceremony which included readings from Pope's works by the actor John Hannah, who is a local resident, and by the actress Dame Harriet Walter.
The sculpture is based on drawings that have survived of an urn designed by Alexander Pope for a friend's garden at Hagley Hall, Worcestershire. The original urn no longer exists.

Rim of the World

Rim of the World is a 2019 American science fiction adventure film directed by McG from a screenplay by Zack Stentz. It stars Jack Gore, Miya Cech, Benjamin Flores Jr. and Alessio Scalzotto. The film, which was Stentz's modern take on the kid-centered action films of the 1980s, was streamed on Netflix on May 24, 2019. It was the most watched content in the SVOD service in the UK the week it was released, overtaking the series "Dead to Me" and "Riverdale.
Plot.
Alex, a socially reclusive boy who recently lost his father in a fire, reluctantly attends a summer camp in southern California called "Rim of the World". He meets two other "misfits" - Zhen Zhen, an initially mute, adorable orphan girl from China, and Dariush, an outspoken boy from a rich family. One afternoon, while in a lake, Zhen Zhen wanders off into the woods, looking for the lookout point she had seen on a camp poster, while Alex attempts to follow. He comes across Dariush, who happens to be nearby answering the call of nature. Dariush mistakenly tries to 'cure' Alex's fear of heights by making him stand near a cliff edge, and Gabriel, a boy they hadn't seen at camp before, intervenes. Zhen Zhen, hearing the commotion, comes back down and meets up with the boys. At that moment, they all receive alarming texts advising they immediately evacuate the area.
While hurrying back, they find out that other campers have left the lake and they witness alien ships invading the valley. The kids head back to the camp, and afterward discover the camp to be empty of people - all except for Conrad, a camp counselor. Suddenly, a Dragon spacecraft fleeing the International Space Station lands heavily nearby. The dying astronaut inside the spacecraft gives Alex a key, with instructions that it should be taken to NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) facility in Pasadena, and that it was the only way to destroy the aliens. An alien appears with its "dog" and kills the astronaut. Alex and his friends try to hide out and Conrad gets killed, but the kids manage to elude the aliens and escape the camp.
They make their way to the sheriff's office and discover an inmate, Lou, who has been left behind in the cells. Lou claims to have a son waiting for him, so an empathetic Alex decides to release him before the group continues on their way to JPL. Later, the group encounters Marines who are evacuating civilians. The commander gratefully takes the key and puts the children on a bus to safety. However, alien ships attack the vehicle convoy and the soldiers are killed, whereupon Alex retrieves the key from the dying commander and the group sets out for JPL once more. During the night, after briefly taking refuge in Gabriel's old house, Gabriel explains that he is an escapee from juvie, where he was placed due to a misunderstanding at his mother's store, in which a customer assumed Gabriel was attempting to steal his change at the deposit box, unaware of Gabriel's dyscalculia. Sometime after, they are attacked by a gang of masked individuals, led by Lou, who reveals himself as a murderous thief and tricked the group into releasing him. He agrees to let the kids go, but only if Alex gives him the key, which Lou thinks he can sell on the black market. Alex refuses and Lou attempts to kill Alex with a knife, but right before Lou attacks him, the alien from the camp appears and attacks them all. Lou and his men are killed, but the kids manage to escape after trapping the alien in a backyard swimming pool.
While they are walking in the forest, Dariush and Gabriel fight and Dariush reveals that his father lost their car dealership, meaning he will go to jail, hence the reason why Dariush was placed at camp. Suddenly, they receive on their transmitter an S.O.S. from the doctor at JPL they were instructed to give the key to, encouraging them to move forward with their journey. The kids walk into a mall and change clothes. After that, the group takes a Ford Mustang= in the parking lot, which they discover Zhen Zhen is able to drive, to quickly journey the rest of the way to JPL, but they are again attacked by the pursuing alien. They abandon the vehicle while trying to escape the alien and realize that they left the key in the car. Dariush attempts to go alone to get the key, only to be injured by the alien in the process, but manages to get away with the key. The group finally make it to the JPL facility, but find that the doctor is dead, and his S.O.S. message was only a result of his blood dripping onto his transmitter. The kids are able to make radio contact with a general at NORAD, who explains that the key holds information that can be used to destroy the alien mothership in orbit via a Cold War defense project named Excalibur. Zhen Zhen goes into the basement to start the emergency generators, where she is attacked by an alien dog, while Alex goes to the roof to realign the communication dish, where he is attacked by the alien. Zhen Zhen manages to lock the dog in the basement and returns to the command room to help Gabriel and the injured Dariush insert the keys that will launch the Excalibur weapon.
Zhen Zhen, Dariush, and Gabriel evacuate the JPL building, while Alex lures the alien into an engine test room and kills it with the engine's exhaust. The teens watch from the ground as the alien mothership is blown up in the atmosphere. Alex is reunited with his mother and the children are celebrated as heroes.
Production.
In March 2018, it was reported that McG would direct "Rim of the World" for Netflix from a screenplay by Zack Stentz. In an interview, Stentz revealed that he started working on the script as early as 2017 and the deal with Netflix was closed a year later. Principal production commenced in May 2018 in Los Angeles, California. In June 2018, the cast was announced.
Principal photography began in June 2018 and reportedly lasted 40 days.
Reception.
On the review aggregator website, Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 27%. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Rim of the World" is too bland to live up to the 80s teen adventures it references, and too full of clichés to be able to set itself apart from them." On IMDb, the score is 5.2/10.

Martyrs of Adrianople

The Martyrs of Adrianople, also known and venerated as the 377 Martyred Companions in Bulgaria, were three hundred and seventy seven Christians who were executed in martyrdom in 815. They are commemorated by the Eastern Orthodox Church on 22 January.
Biography.
Emperor Nikephoros I invaded Bulgaria and sacked the capital of Pliska in 811, but was killed and his army annihilated at the Battle of Varbitsa Pass as he returned to Roman territory. Khan Krum's peace offer was rejected by Emperor Michael I Rangabe, and the Bulgarians invaded the Roman Empire in the spring of 812. Krum conquered Develtos and transplanted its population to Bulgaria in June, and seized Adrianople in September 813. At Adrianople, Krum threw Manuel, Archbishop of Adrianople, to the ground and trampled on his neck.
According to the "Menologion of Basil II", Krum began the persecution of Christians prior to his death and was continued by a certain Čok (Tzok) who had all Christians who refused to renounce their faith executed. However, the "Synaxarion of Constantinople" states that the persecution began after Krum's death in April 814 on the orders of Khan Dičevg, the successor of Dukum, who had ruled briefly after Krum's death. Omurtag later became khan and ordered the execution of all Christians who refused to renounce their faith. Three hundred and seventy seven Christians were killed, and the following are known by name:
Hagiography.
An original account of the martyrs was likely made based on the testimonies of prisoners of war released by Bulgaria after the Treaty of 816 in the first half of the 9th century at the Monastery of Stoudios at Constantinople which the "menologion" and "synaxarion" are based on. Sophoulis suggests that the story of the martyrdom was Roman propaganda to deter officials from collaborating with the Bulgars and strengthen the resolve of cities vulnerable to Bulgar attack. He also suggests that the number of martyrs may be exaggerated.

Habsburg Palace, Cieszyn

Habsburg Hunting Palace is a Classicist palace built in 1838-1840 in Cieszyn, Poland. It has been designed by Viennese architect Joseph Kornhäusel, constructed on the earthwork of the lower castle.
History.
In 1838 the arch-prince Karl Ludwig Habsburg brought Joseph Kornhäusel , a representative of Viennese classicism, to Cieszyn. The upper and lower castles were destroyed during the Thirty Years' War. Karl Ludwig ordered Kornhäusel to rebuild the remains of the castle to make it his residence. To achieve the aim the ruins were demolished and the remains of the lower castle were used to build the so-called Hunting Palace between 1838-1840. Next to the Palace a single-story classicist conservatory was built, which was demolished in 1966.
The Palace did not perform its original function. It was rarely visited by the Habsburgs (who most often stayed in Vienna) and on everyday basis was the seat of the Chamber of Cieszyn. However, concerts and performances that took place in the conservatory that was located next to the palace became historical; a concert of Franz Liszt in June 1846 and Wagner performances of artists of the Viennese opera organised by the arch-duke Eugene Ferdinand at the end of the 1880s of the nineteenth century.
Occasional visits of the Habsburgs were always special events – one of the visitors was the emperor Francis Joseph the First who stayed in the Hunting Palace in 1880, 1890 and 1906. On the first floor of the palace there was a special suite consisting of a study, living room, reception room and a bedroom with a toilet, waiting for him. During the visits of Franz Joseph, the so-called "Tent from Custoza" was put up for him and his guests - a gift from the arch-duke Albrecht (the arch-duke took part in the victorious battle of Custoza).
When between 1914 – 1916 Cieszyn was the headquarters of the Austro-Hungarian Army (AOK – Armeeoberkommando), the archduke Frederick hosted his allies in the Palace, among others the German emperor Wilhelm II, Bulgarian king Ferdinand and Marshal Hindenburg. The last visit of the archduke Ferdinand to the palace took place on 3 December 1916.
In 1918 the Hunting Palace became the seat of the National Council of the Duchy of Cieszyn, the first Polish authority in the area of Cieszyn Silesia. Since 1974 a part of the Hunting Palace has been the seat of the "Ignacy Paderewski State School of Music". Since 2005, i.e. the time of renovation, the remaining part of the palace and a newly build conservatory (constructed at the site of the former) has served as the seat of "Zamek Cieszyn" (formerly: "Śląski Zamek Sztuki i Przedsiębiorczości") - a cultural institution that is a design centre.
Architecture.
The Habsburg Palace was constructed as a hunting lodge. The Palace, constructed on the plan of an inverted letter T, is located on the site of the lower castle on the eastern slope of a hill and its façade faces the city. The Habsburg residence is a two-story brick building. Its central part has three storeys. The central part of the palace is of a palladian structure of a serliana; an arch flanked at the sides by flat cornices and crowned by a triangle pediment. It is located between by two storeyed wings with symmetrically distributed vestibules. Builders used the remains of two fortified towers located in the south and north wings (so called bastei). In the 19th century side wings were added; the south one located perpendicularly and the north one parallel to the main part of the building.
The interior arrangement of the main part of the palace is based on a three bay plan, whereas the wings are based on a one bay plan with a corridor and a two bay plan. The interiors have a barrel vault with lunettes and a sail vault. There are also ceilings with coves.
The façade of the residence has thirteen axes, the three central ones of which have been emphasised by a protrusion and crowned by a triangular bridgehead. The one storey part has a projection with three axes and a balcony with a cast-iron balustrade. A storey of the building is made distinct by a central arch emphasised by pilasters that support entablature. The windows on the ground floor are square with dimpled frames, whereas the ones on the first floor are closed with triangular pediments on consoles and cornices on the side parts.
The side walls of the palace are multi-axis. A loggia located in the south fortified tower has four opened doric columns that support a triangular pediment.
In front of the palace there is a two-arm and symmetrical access road with the "Monument to honour Silesian Legionnaires fallen for Poland", located between the arms of the road. The monument is designed by Jan Raszka and commemorates the fallen legionnaires of Silesia.
Trivia.
"The Monument to honour Silesian Legionnaires fallen for Poland" is also called "The Silesian Woman and Nike of Cieszyn".
The walls of the north bastei are 2.1 metres thick.

Radio Galaxy Zoo

Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) is an internet crowdsourced citizen science project that seeks to locate supermassive black holes in distant galaxies. It is hosted by the web portal Zooniverse. The scientific team want to identify black hole/jet pairs and associate them with the host galaxies. Using a large number of classifications provided by citizen scientists they hope to build a more complete picture of black holes at various stages and their origin. It was initiated in 2010 by Ray Norris in collaboration with the Zooniverse team, and was driven by the need to cross-identify the millions of extragalactic radio sources that will be discovered by the forthcoming Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey. RGZ is now led by scientists Julie Banfield and Ivy Wong. RGZ started operations on 17 December 2013.
RGZ Data Sources.
The project's scientific team are drawn mostly from Australia, with support from Zooniverse developers and other institutions. They use data taken by the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST) survey which was observed at the Very Large Array between 1993 and 2011. Also used was data from the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS), taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in rural New South Wales. The infrared astronomy used was observed by Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Spitzer Space Telescope.
RGZ Publications.
RGZ has published five scientific studies (May 2018).
i) Radio Galaxy Zoo: host galaxies and radio morphologies derived from visual inspection. (November 2015)
The abstract begins: "We present results from the first twelve months of operation of Radio Galaxy Zoo, which upon completion will enable visual inspection of over 170,000 radio sources to determine the host galaxy of the radio emission and the radio morphology." It then explains that RGZ "uses 1.4GHz radio images from both the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) and the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) in combination with mid-infrared images at 3.4μm from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and at 3.6μm from the Spitzer Space Telescope." Its aims are that when complete, RGZ will measure the relative populations and properties of host galaxies; processes that might also provide an avenue for finding radio structures that are rare and extreme.
On the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) website, an article from September 2015 named "Volunteer black hole hunters as good as the experts" explains how citizen scientists are as good as professionals at RGZ's tasks. The research team tested trained citizen scientists and ten professional astronomers using a hundred images to help quantify the quality of the data gathered. As the initial results were published, facts and figures from RGZ became available. More than 1.2 million radio images have been looked at, which enabled 60,000 radio sources to be matched to their host galaxies: "A feat that would have taken a single astronomer working 40 hours a week roughly 50 years to complete."
ii) Radio Galaxy Zoo: discovery of a poor cluster through a giant wide-angle tail radio galaxy. (May 2016)
The abstract begins: "We have discovered a previously unreported poor cluster of galaxies (RGZ-CL J0823.2+0333) through an unusual giant wide-angle tail radio galaxy found in the Radio Galaxy Zoo project." It continues to explain that the analysis of 2MASX J08231289+0333016's surrounding environment indicates that it is within a poor cluster. Radio morphology suggests that, firstly, "the host galaxy is moving at a significant velocity with respect to an ambient medium like that of at least a poor cluster" and secondly that "the source may have had two ignition events of the active galactic nucleus with 10^7yrs in between." These suggestions reinforce the idea that there is an association between RGZ J082312.9+033301 and the newly discovered poor cluster.
On The Conversation website in an article "How citizen scientists discovered a giant cluster of galaxies", Ray Norris writes about the above study. He explains that two Russian citizen scientists (CSs), Ivan Terentev and Tim Matorny, were participating in RGZ when they noticed something odd with one of the radio sources. It became clear that the radio source the two CSs had found "was just one of a line of radio blobs that delineate a C-shaped “wide angle tail galaxy” (WATG)." Lead scientist Julie Banfield explained that this was "something that none of us had even thought would be possible."
WATGs are rare objects that are formed when jets of electrons from black holes, usually seen to be straight, are bent into a C shape by intergalactic gas. This characteristic shape is "a sure sign that there is intergalactic gas, signifying a cluster of galaxies, the largest known objects in the universe." The WATG discovered by Terentev and Matorny is one of the largest known and has led to the cluster being named after them. "This cluster, more than a billion light years away, contains at least 40 galaxies, marking an intersection of the sheets and filaments of the cosmic web that make up our universe." Clusters, despite their importance, are hard to find but the use of WATGs might be a way of finding more: However WATGs are rare.
On the National Radio Astronomy Observatory website, Matorny and Terentev commented on their discovery. “I am still amazed and feel more motivated to look for stunning new radio galaxies,” Matorny said. Terentev added, “I got a chance to see the whole process of science … and I have been a part of it!”
iii) Radio Galaxy Zoo: A Search for Hybrid Morphology Radio Galaxies. (December 2017)
The abstract begins: "Hybrid morphology radio sources are a rare type of radio galaxy that display different Fanaroff-Riley classes on opposite sides of their nuclei." The authors explain that RGZ has enabled them to discover 25 new candidate hybrid morphology radio galaxies (HyMoRS). These HyMoRS are at distances between redshifts z=0.14 and 1.0. Nine of the host galaxies have previous spectra and include quasars and a rare Green bean galaxy. It states: "Although the origin of the hybrid morphology radio galaxies is still unclear, this type of radio source starts depicting itself as a rather diverse class." The abstract ends:"While high angular resolution follow-up observations are still necessary to confirm our candidates, we demonstrate the efficacy of the Radio Galaxy Zoo in the pre-selection of these sources from all-sky radio surveys, and report the reliability of citizen scientists in identifying and classifying complex radio sources."
In an article on the ARC Centre of Excellence for All-Sky Astrophysics CAASTRO website named "Citizen scientists bag a bunch of 'two-faced' galaxies", the author explains the findings of the above study. The lead scientist is Anna Kapinska with CS Ivan Terentev named second. Kapinska's team have been looking for rare types of galaxies named Hybrid Morphology Radio Galaxies (HyMoRS). These show galaxy characteristics that are combined, rather than distinct. The article states: "Finding more HyMoRS helps us understand what kind of galaxy can turn out this way, and what gives them their unusual properties. Knowing that, in turn, helps us better understand how all galaxies evolve."
The first recognised HyMoRS was discovered in 2002 and since then 30 more. RGZ near doubled the discoveries by adding 25 more. Galaxies with black holes that produce jets are often "divided into two classes, Fanaroff-Riley I and Fanaroff-Riley II (or FR I and II). FR I galaxies have jets that fade away as they extend outwards, while FR II galaxies have jets that end in a bright, strongly-emitting region (a ‘hotspot’)." Explanations include the behaviour of the central black hole, different densities of matter in the surrounding environment or simply illusions because of different distances.
iv) Radio Galaxy Zoo: Cosmological Alignment of Radio Sources (November 2017)
In November 2017, a team led by Omar Contigiani published a paper in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society studying the mutual alignment of radio sources. Using data drawn from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) and TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS), they investigate the most powerful radio sources, namely the largest elliptical galaxies emitting plasma-filled jets. The abstract begins: "We study the mutual alignment of radio sources within two surveys, FIRST and TGSS. This is done by producing two position angle catalogues containing the preferential directions of respectively 30059 and 11674 extended sources distributed over more than 7000 and 17000 square degrees." The FIRST sample sources were identified by participants in RGZ, while the TGSS sample was the result of an automated process. Marginal evidence of local alignment is found in the FIRST sample, which has a 2% probability of being by chance. This supports other recent research by scientists using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The abstract ends: "The TGSS sample is found to be too sparsely populated to manifest a similar signal." Results suggest that there is a relative alignment present at cosmological distances.
v) Radio Galaxy Zoo: Compact and extended radio source classification with deep learning (May 2018).
In May 2018, Lukic and team published a study in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society concerning machine learning techniques. The abstract begins: "Machine learning techniques have been increasingly useful in astronomical applications over the last few years, for example in the morphological classification of galaxies."
Gems of the Galaxy Zoos (ZooGems).
During the next two years, up to 105 RGZ objects will be observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as a result of Program 15445, whose P.I. is William Keel. The program's abstract begins: "The classic Galaxy Zoo project and its successors have been rich sources of interesting astrophysics beyond their initial goals. Green Pea starbursts, AGN ionization echoes, dust in backlit spirals, AGN in pseudobulges, have all seen HST followup programs." As a result of NASA 'gap fillers' initiative, it is hoped that significant scientific progress can be made by HST observations of a total of 304 objects, which have been chosen by voters using a Zooniverse custom-made interface. Keel stated: "Each one of them might not be enough for an individual study, but when you put them all together it adds up to an interesting study."

Willy Sägebrecht

Willy Sägebrecht (21 February 1904 – 8 April 1981) was a political activist and politician from the Communist Party of Germany who was incarcerated as a resistance activist during the Nazi period. After 1945 he became a member of East Germany's powerful Party Cenral Committee and then, in 1957, head of the country's .
Life.
Provenance and early years.
Willy Sägebrecht was born in (Barnim), a short distance to the north of Berlin. His father is described variously as a farmworker, a factory worker and a brick maker. After leaving school in 1918 Sägebrecht worked in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors in and Liebenwalde. In 1920 he joined the Free and the . In 1923 he switched to the Young Communists and in 1925, having reached his twenty-first birthday six months earlier, he joined the Communist Party itself. Within the party he was initially drawn to the extremist faction, but after a couple of years he turned back to the Communist mainstream of the time, becoming a member of the party's local leadership team ("Bezirksleitung") for in 1927.
In November 1929 Sägebrecht was elected a local councillor for Liebenwalde and a district councillor for . During 1929/30 he worked as an instructor in with the party's "Military Policy" department ("Abteilung Militärpolitik"), the cover name used for what was in effect the party's intelligence service. During 1930/31 he visited Moscow where he attended a course for party officials at the "Military Academy" of the Communist International (Comintern). On his return he became a party instructor for , a role he retained till 1933. He was also employed as a policy leader ("Polleiter ") in the party's "sub-region north" ("Unterbezirk Nord"), in which capacity he worked closely with Walter Ulbricht. On 24 April 1932 Willy Sägebrecht was elected to membership of the Prussian regional parliament ("Landtag"). He was involved in a significant brawl in the parliament between Communist and Nazi members on 21 May 1932.
Nazi years.
The Nazi Party took power at the start of 1933 and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. On 4 April 1933 Sägebrecht and , his comrade in the local leadership team ("Bezirksleitung"), were arrested. They were subjected to physical mistreatment by Nazi paramilitaries at a nearby barracks and then taken to Sonnenburg concentration camp. Sägebrecht was released at the end of October 1933. He made contact with Albert Kayser, formerly a Communist member of the national parliament ("Reichstag"), and returned to party work - now illegal - in the Berlin sub-region. He was re-arrested on 17 December 1934.
In January 1936 Sägebrecht faced the special people's court and was convicted on the relatively unusual charge of "intellectual activism" ("intellektuelle Willenstäterschaft"). He was sentenced to a five-year jail term, but in the event he spent the rest of the Nazi period in a succession of prisons and concentration camps, released only in April 1945. His final transfer came in March 1941 and saw him sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. With other "political detainees" he created a "party group". Observing the divisions among the Nazi camp administrators they were able to identify which guards might prove helpful if cultivated, and by this method they managed to receive regular newspapers and other snippets of news about Germany from outside the camp. There were times when prisoners were sent to work outside the camp, and on one of these occasions the "party group" around Sägebrecht managed to throw from the truck a number of anti-Hitler leaflets that they had managed to produce inside the concentration camp.
During the early months of 1945 the Soviet army advanced relentlessly from the east, and in April the authorities in Germany desperately raced to empty the concentration camps. Sachsenhausen inmates were evicted and sent on forced marches ("death marches") towards the west and north, but as discipline collapsed it was increasingly the guards themselves who fled. Sources state simply that in the course of the death march from Sachsenhausen towards Schwerin Willy Sägebrecht was freed by Soviet troops near Below.
Soviet occupation zone.
Directly following the , in the middle of May 1945 Sägebrecht became a member of the Communist Party Initiative Group around his old comrade, Walter Ulbricht. On 30 April 1945 Ulbricht had been flown over from Moscow, where with many comrades he had spent the war, bringing a group of 30 men and, as matter turned out, a detailed and well thought through nation-building agenda. The entire region surrounding Berlin - roughly the middle third of Germany - was now administered as the Soviet occupation zone. Sägebrecht was employed by the Berlin city administration ("Magistratverwaltung") in the social welfare section. He also engaged, from Potsdam, in re-establishing a party leadership team ("KPD-Provinzialleitung Brandenburg"), becoming the Brandenburg regional party secretary.
At the party conference of 2/3 March 1946 Willy Sägebrecht was one of 19 party officials co-opted onto the Party Central Committee. A few weeks later, on 7 April 1946, the contentious special conference took place at which the old Communist Party was merged with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in order to create the Socialist Unity Party ("Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands" / SED). The merger, which as events turned out was only directly implemented in the Soviet occupation zone, was intended to unite the political left and thereby make it impossible for right wing populists to take power, as had happened in 1933. Sägebrecht gave a lead as one of thousands of comrades who lost no time in signing their Communist Party memberships across to the new party. By the time the Soviet Occupation Zone was relaunched, in October 1949, as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany) the SED had itself become the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship.
Under the Leninist power structure implemented in the Soviet Occupation Zone after 1946, political power was centralised on the Party Central Committee. The political influence of parliaments or of government ministers was relatively constrained. However, the centralisation of power was to some extent blurred by the fact that the same individuals often held positions of influence both within the Central Committee and in the quasi-democratic institutions. Willy Sägebrecht was a case in point, sitting as a member of the People's Council ("Volksrat") and then of its successor body, the East German national parliament ("Volkskammer") between 1948 and 1958. In 1950 he became, in addition, a member of the National Council of the National Front, the administrative structure used by the SED to control the allocation of parliamentary seats to bloc parties and mass organisations.
Between 1946 and 1950 he sat as a member of the . From 1946 till 1949 he also shared the chairmanship of the regional Party Executive for Brandenburg with Friedrich Ebert Jr.. In December 1948 Ebert, who was son to the first president of the German Republic, became mayor of East Berlin, vacating his position as co-chair of the regional party executive. Sägebrecht remained in post, now sharing the top job in the Brandenburg regional party executive with till July 1952. Between 1949 and 1952 Willy Sägebrecht also served as first secretary of the Brandenburg Party Executive. He was fully engaged in the of the Brandenburg party.
German Democratic Republic.
In July 1952 Sagebrecht was appointed a secretary of state and first deputy chairman at the . He might have seemed at this point to be on the verge of a stellar political career. However, the State Planning Commission was also where the ambitions and promises of ambitious party leaders all too often came face to face with inconvenient economic realities. Willy Sägebrecht was not the first, and he certainly would not be the last East German politician for whom involvement with the State Planning Commission broke the trajectory of a hitherto promising career in the political mainstream. In 1954 he was diverted into the , appointed a KVP colonel in October 1954. He was responsible for "Administration Co-ordination" which according to at least one source was a "camouglage designation" for Military Intelligence.
In 1945 the World War victors were agreed that no future German state should be permitted to have an army. Ten years later, cold war rivalries were calling that wartime consensus into question. To the west, the American, British and French occupation zones were merged and relaunched as the German Federal Republic (West Germany) in May 1949, and the West German army (Bundeswehr) was inaugurated in November 1955. In the former Soviet occupation zone (East Germany), it now transpired - at least from the western perspective - that the had been created to be a national East German army by another name: in March 1956 it was duly launched as the National People's Army (" Nationale Volksarmee"). Within it, in September 1957 Willy Sägebrecht became head of military intelligence in succession to Karl Linke who had become suspected (correctly) of spying on behalf of "the west". In the event of some sort of an east-west war, Sägebrecht's responsibilities would have included masterminding and conducting force-based operations in West Germany, including the activation of partisan networks.
Sägebrecht himself was retired from his military intelligence responsibilities in August 1959, officially on health grounds. In the words of one source "he was not successful". His "retirement" came shortly after a senior member of his department, Siegfried Dombrowski, had fled to West Berlin. His successor, appointed on 31 August 1959, was another senior member of the department, Arthur Franke, whom he had first met in 1945 as the two of them fled from the concentraion camp.
There is no indication that Sägebrecht's own loyalty to the regime was ever in question: he remained a Party Central Committee member till 1963. However, after September 1959 he lived as a pensioner in East Berlin. In 1968 he published his memoires under the title "Nicht Amboß, sondern Hammer sein" ("lossely "Not an anvil but a hammer""). When he died, in 1981, his ashes were placed at the Friedrichsfelde Cemetery in the , alongside those of others whose memories the government celebrated and revered.

Leucospermum gerrardii

Leucospermum gerrardii is an evergreen, mat-forming shrub of mostly about 30 cm (12 in) high and up to in diameter, with branches originating from an underground rootstock. It has narrow leaves, sometimes with three or four teeth near the tip, and prominent, raised, netted to parallel veins. The flower heads are egg-shaped about 5 cm (2 in) in diameter and consist of at first yellow, later orange or scarlet perianths, and long styles reaching far beyond the perianth and together giving the impression of a pincushion. It is assigned to the family Proteaceae. It can be found in South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga) and Swaziland. It mostly flowers between September and November. The species is called dwarf pincushion or soapstone pincushion in English.
Description.
"Leucospermum gerrardii" is a high, evergreen, mat-forming shrub of up to in diameter, with upright branches originating from an underground rootstock. These generally form a closed cover of equal height, so the result is somewhat reminiscent of a cushion. The stems that carry the flower heads are slender, upright, thick, initially covered in spiderweb-like hairs, which get lost with age. The leaves linear to inverted lance-shaped, sometimes curved sideways like a sabre, long and ¾–2 cm (0.3–0.8 in) wide, at the foot gradually narrowing into a distinct leaf stalk. The leaves usually have an entire margin and end in a bony tip, but sometimes have three or four teeth with a bony tip. They initially have some fine and soft hair on their surface, but this soon wears off. The leaves also have a prominent pattern of raised, netted to parallel veins.
The flower heads are egg-shaped in diameter atop a long stalk, sit mostly individually, but sometimes with two or three together near the end of the branches. The communal base of the flowers in the same head has is cylinder-shaped 1½–2½ cm (0.6–1.0 in) long and in diameter. It is covered underneath by oval bracts with a pointy tip of about 1 cm (0.4 in) long and half as wide, very densely covered in soft hairs, rubbery in consistency and set in two or three whorls. The bracts that subtend the individual flowers are narrower oval with a pointy tip, are about 1 cm long and wide, rubbery in consistency and embracing the flower at its foot. It is thickly woolly at its base and ends in a tuft of long straight hairs at its tip. The perianth is 3–3½ cm (1.2–1.4 in) long, initially yellow but later coloring orange to scarlet. The lower part of the tetramerous perianth is fused into a tube, the middle part that consist of the claws is ruptured by the style at anthesis, the parts coiling, the lobe facing the center of the flower head with fine very short, powdery hairs, the other lobes are thickly set with felty hairy. The upper part of the periant (or limbs) are lance-shaped and pointy at the tip, about ½ cm (0.2 in) long, have a dense growth of with long straight hairs. The lance-shaped, pointy anthers are directly attached to the upper part of the perianth, are about 3 mm (0.12 in) long and lack a filament. The style that is about 5 cm (2 in) long, tapers towards the tip and slightly curves towards the center of the flower head. It is topped by a slight thickening called pollen presenter, which has a slender cone-shape with a pointy tip, is 2–2½ mm (0.08–0.1 in) long, with a groove at the very end that acts as the stigma. The ovary is subtended by four nectar producing awl-shaped scales of about 2 mm (0.08 in) long. It mostly flowers between September and December.
The subtribe Proteinae, to which the genus "Leucospermum" has been assigned, consistently has a basic chromosome number of twelve (2n=24).
Differences with related species.
The dwarf pincushion differs from its nearest relatives ("L. cuneiforme", "L. innovans" and "L. saxosum") and other species with cylinder-shaped receptacles (common base of the flowers in one head) by growing in low cushion-like clusters, by the linear to inverted lance-shaped leaves that slightly curve sideways (like a sabre), and by having raised veins.
Taxonomy.
Otto Stapf described the dwarf pincushion in 1912, and named it in honor of William Tyrer Gerrard, who had collected the first specimens known to science probably in 1865. Although plants from central KwaZulu-Natal overall have broader leaves than those from Mpumalange, a continuous grade between the extremes exists, and no subtaxa have been proposed. "L. gerrardii" has been assigned to the section "Crassicaudex".
Distribution, habitat and ecology.
The dwarf pincushion mainly occurs in grassveld among granite and quartzite outcrops in the higher mountain areas at 1200–1800 m (4,000–6,000 ft) in the Makhonjwa Mountains near Barberton and the northwest of Swaziland. A few small and isolated populations can be found on grassland on Table Mountain Sandstone and Ecca Sandstone in central Natal at 450–1100 m (1,500–3,500 ft) altitude. It is often associated with serpentine in the underground. Annual rainfall may be as much as 1000 mm (40 in) or 1500 mm (60 in) at the greater altitudes, mainly falling during the summer. The flowers are mainly pollinated by birds. The seeds are released from the heads about two months after flowering and are collected by ants that bring them to their underground nests. "L. gerrardii" plants survive the regular grass fires that kill the above-ground branches, because it regenerates from the many spreading, underground stems.
Conservation.
"L. gerrardii" is considered near threatened, due to a reduction of the population by about 30% over the last hundred years that was caused by afforestation, overgrazing, too high-frequency burning and habitat fragmentation.

Evelyn Daniel Anderson

Evelyn Daniel Anderson (August 2, 1926 – October 7, 1998) was an American educator and advocate for physically disabled people.
Early life and education.
Anderson was the daughter of Dr. Thomas J. Anderson and Frances Daniel Anderson of Greensboro, Alabama. She was hit by a stray bullet at the age of four, became paraplegic, and used a gurney or a wheelchair for the rest of her life. In 1948, she graduated with a degree in art and history from Judson College. While she was a student at Judson, she was an officer in the Judson chapter of the Sigma Delta Pi honor society. In 1964, Anderson earned a master's degree from the University of Alabama.
Career.
In 1948, she began teaching art unofficially at a high school in Greensboro; an Alabama law at the time prohibited severely disabled persons from teaching. She inspired a new law in 1953 that overturned this restriction. In 1954, she became the first seriously disabled educator to be hired by an Alabama public school. She taught English and Spanish, and after 1964 also served as a guidance counselor, at Greensboro High School. She retired from teaching in 1982.

Calinaga cercyon

Calinaga cercyon is a butterfly found in the Palearctic that belongs to the browns 
family. It is endemic to West China and East Tibet.
Description from Seitz.
C. cercyon Nicev. (59e) has the markings quite similar to ["saka" Moore form of "Calinaga buddha"] -, but the ground is yellowish; moreover, the position of the distal spots of the forewing is somewhat different, so that we apparently have to do with a distinct species.— West China: Ta-tsien-lu.

2017 Donegal Senior Football Championship

The 2017 Donegal Senior Football Championship was the 95th official edition of Donegal GAA's premier Gaelic football tournament for senior graded clubs in County Donegal. Sixteen teams compete with the winner representing Donegal in the Ulster Senior Club Football Championship.
The championship began with four groups of four and continued with a knock-out format.
Glenswilly were the defending champions after they defeated Kilcar 1-10 to 0-12 in the 2016 final.
C. J. Molloy scored a contender for goal of the season against Glenswilly in their opening group match, though his club lost. Directly from the second-half throw-in, he soloed through the Glenswilly defence and kicked the ball into the net from a distance of around 25 yards.
This was Burt's debut in the senior grade after winning the 2016 Donegal I.F.C. title.

5α-Dihydronormethandrone

5α-Dihydronormethandrone (5α-DHNMT; developmental code name RU-575), also known as 17α-methyl-4,5α-dihydro-19-nortestosterone or as 17α-methyl-5α-estran-17β-ol-3-one, is an androgen/anabolic steroid and a likely metabolite of normethandrone formed by 5α-reductase. Analogously to nandrolone and its 5α-reduced metabolite 5α-dihydronandrolone, 5α-DHNMT shows reduced affinity for the androgen receptor relative to normethandrone. Its affinity for the androgen receptor is specifically about 33 to 60% of that of normethandrone.

Solar Egg (sauna)

Solar Egg is an egg-shaped sauna created by the artist duo Bigert &amp; Bergström for Riksbyggen.The sauna sits perched in Luossabacken in Kiruna. The egg consists of a pine wood interior and a highly reflected gold steel panels. Its 4-meter wide interior can fit up to eight people. while the inside still functions as a normal sauna with a wood-heated heart-shaped stove to keep the room around 170°F. Illumination comes in the form of LED lightning, which is powered by its sets of batteries. 
Beyond its function as a sauna, Solar Egg is essentially a public sculpture developed in collaboration with artist duo Bigert &amp; Bergström. The egg was temporarily moved to the Swedish Institute in central Paris, to draw attention to the Swedish design and visitors were able to experience the sauna first-hand. Solar Egg was recognized with Red Dot awards and German Design Awards as well as being nominated in the London International Awards and the Swedish design awards.
The egg shape seeks to symbolize rebirth and new opportunities at the start of Kiruna's urban transformation, a project that involves the relocation of the entire cities districts in response to ground subsidence caused by decades of iron ore minings. 
Construction.
In Kiruna, Sweden, the entire community is being forced to move due to ground complications caused by a nearby ore mine. The Swedish artist duo Bigert &amp; Bergström was commissioned by Riksbyggen to design commemorative social sculpture for the town after the residents voiced fears of losing community spirit after their relocation. The idea appears to be working, as travel groups are now offering free visits to the Solar Egg.

World Touring Car Cup

The FIA World Touring Car Cup (abbreviated to WTCR, referring to the use of TCR regulations) is an international touring car championship promoted by Eurosport Events and sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). It has had different incarnation of a World Touring Car Cup held between 1993 and 1995. Following the 2017 season, an agreement was reached for the World Touring Car Championship to become WTCR and use the TCR technical regulations. With titles for drivers and teams only, the WTCR series changed to 'World Cup' rather than 'World Championship' status in 2018.
History.
Touring Car World Cup (1993–1995).
In 1993, with the high popularity of the Super Touring category, the FIA hosted the FIA Touring Car World Cup — an annual event for touring car drivers hailing from national championships all over the world. The 1993 race at Monza was won by New Zealand's Paul Radisich, at the wheel of a Ford Mondeo ahead of Nicola Larini's Alfa Romeo 155, with no manufacturer title awarded. The race was run for two more years, (won by Paul Radisich again in 1994 at Donington Park in a Ford Mondeo, manufacturer title went to BMW, and Frank Biela in 1995 at Paul Ricard in an Audi A4 Quattro, and manufacturer title went to Audi). A similar event was planned for 1996 at the A1 Ring, Austria, but was cancelled due to a low number of provisional entries (10 cars). It was never brought back thereafter.
World Touring Car Cup (2018–present).
On 6 December 2017, during the FIA's World Motorsport Council in Paris, it was approved the formation of the new World Touring Car Cup starting from 2018. The new series would utilize the TCR rules, which have been in use in numerous national and international touring car racing series, including the TCR International Series. As a result of the formation of the WTCR, both the WTCC in its current format and the TCR International Series would be discontinued immediately.
A new format was introduced, with one qualifying session and one race on the first day and a three-phase qualifying session on the second day and two races, with the first one having the top 10 of the grid reversed.
Rules.
Car homologation.
Cars have to be production models, with a minimum production of 5000 samples in a year. 
The engine is limited to a displacement of up to 2 liters, turbo charged, and with the aid of restrictors, to a maximum yield of 350 Hp.
Each car is assigned a minimum racing weight which is used to balance the performances.
Scoring system.
For the 2019 season, FIA WTCR races are awarded the following points, similar to MotoGP scoring system.:

Edward Matthew Fenwick

Edward Matthew Fenwick (1812 – 16 October 1877), also known as Edward Matthew Reid, was a British Liberal Party politician.
Fenwick was the second son of Edward James and Caroline (née Cuddon) Reid. At some point he changed his name by Royal Licence from Reid to Fenwick. In 1841, he married Sarah Fenwick Bowen, daughter of Thomas Fenwick, and they had at least two children: Thomas Fenwick Fenwick (1842–1907), and Robert Fenwick Fenwick (–1868).
Fenwick was elected Liberal MP for Lancaster at a by-election in 1864—caused by the resignation of William Garnett—and held the seat until 1866 when he was unseated for corruption. The seat was later disenfranchised under the Reform Act 1867.
Fenwick was also a Justice of the Peace for Lancashire, Yorkshire and Westmorland, and, in 1865, Deputy Lieutenant for Lancaster.

The 2008 Conwy Council election took place on 1 May 2008 to elect members of Conwy County Borough Council in Wales. It was on the same day as other 2008 United Kingdom local elections. The previous elections took place on 10 June 2004 and the following election took place on 3 May 2012.
Fifty nine county councillors were elected from the county's thirty eight electoral wards. The biggest gains were by the Conservative Party with eight additional seats, while the Labour Party and Independent group lost out. There were several very close results, with the Conservatives winning in Capelulo by 26 votes, the sitting veteran Labour councillor in Llandudno's Tudno losing by 27 votes and the Independent councillor in Llansannan winning by only four votes. Similarly to the previous Conwy elections in 1995, 1999 and 2004, no party or group ended in overal majority control.
By-elections between 2009-2011.
Marl (2011).
20 January 2011 - Liberal Democrat gain from Conservative. This followed the resignation of a Conservative councillor.
Uwchaled (2011).
16 June 2011 - Independent gain from Plaid Cymru.

Intermediate progenitor cell

Intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) are a type of progenitor cell in the developing cerebral cortex. They are multipolar cells produced by radial glial cells who have undergone asymmetric division. IPCs can produce neuron cells via neurogenesis and are responsible for ensuring the proper quantity of cortical neurons are produced. In mammals, neural stem cells are the primary progenitors during embryogenesis whereas intermediate progenitor cells are the secondary progenitors. 
Function.
Neurogenesis is a vital part of embryonic development. IPCs divide symmetrically, primarily in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the neuroepithelium to produce either a new pair of IPC's or a pair of neurons. Fully developed neurons are most likely targeted to the upper cortical layers. Recent studies have shown that IPC's are activated by similar factors in both adult and embryonic development, challenging the early notion that they were only needed in embryogenesis.
Neurogenesis is also a two-tiered pattern. When radial glial cells divide, they produce one replacement radial glial cell and one IPC. That IPC can then divide to form two like neurons. This method is important because it allows more neurons to be produced while still conserving glia to regenerate the cycle. The asymmetric division of radial glial cells and the subsequent symmetric division of intermediate progenitor cells may be the mechanism that resulted in the expansion of the cerebral cortex during evolution. The interactions between symmetric and asymmetric division work to enhance the productiveness during the development period and allow the cortex to grow.
Some intermediate progenitor cells migrate via the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb and differentiate further. 
Overall, IPCs are crucial to both adult and embryonic neural development, but the research explaining the mechanisms for their symmetric division is still limited. 
Regulation of IPCs.
During development, intermediate progenitor cells are spatially associated with blood vessels. Once the vessels have passed into the brain’s cortex, IPCs mimic their capillary patterns. After alignment, IPC divisions are localized to the vessel branches, suggesting that the vascular system is needed to produce the proper stem-cell niche for differentiation.
Tbr2 was also found to be organized along blood vessels. It is assumed that Tbr2 are needed to ensure the proper patterns of IPC division through its action in a signaling cascade .
Nfix is thought to be a necessary transcription factor facilitating proper symmetric and asymmetric division. It was identified following neurogenesis inadequacies observed when cells presented Nfix deficiencies.
Tis21 was found to regulate the frequency of symmetric divisions is response to Tis21 levels, suggesting it plays some role in the mechanism for division.

The season was also the sixth following the merge between the European Rally Championship and the Intercontinental Rally Challenge. Kajetan Kajetanowicz was the reigning champion but he didn't return to defend his title.
For the second season, the European Junior Championship was split into two new categories. ERC Junior U27, which totals six events, is for drivers born on or after 1 January 1991 competing in R2 cars on Pirelli tyres. With the best four rounds counting, the winner will receive a career progression fund worth 100,000 euros to use in ERC Junior U28 in 2019.
ERC Junior U28 offers the next step on the rallying pyramid for drivers born on or after 1 January 1990. Again totalling six rounds with the best four scores counting, drivers use R5 cars with no restriction on tyre choice. The champion will get a drive on a European round of the 2019 FIA World Rally Championship as a P1 driver in a 2016-specification World Rally Car.
Calendar.
The calendar for the 2018 season features eight rallies like the previous season. Rajd Rzeszowski was replaced by Rally Poland.

Sabellia gens

The gens Sabellia was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. Few members of this gens are mentioned in history, and none of them achieved any of the higher offices of the Roman state. The most famous of this family was Sabellius of Ptolemais in Pentapolis, the author of the so-called Sabellian Heresy. Other Sabellii are known from inscriptions.
Origin.
The nomen "Sabellius" belongs to a class of gentilicia typically formed directly from cognomina ending in "-illus" and "-ellus", typically diminutive suffixes. The surname "Sabellus" referred to a member of the Oscan-speaking peoples of central and southern Italy, particularly the Sabines, Marsi, Samnites, and their relatives, and thus the name belongs to a common type of cognomen derived from the names of peoples and places of origin.
Branches and cognomina.
The only cognomina known from this gens were "Primus", first, a surname that usually indicated the eldest of a group of siblings, and "Dilectus", dear or beloved. There is no evidence that either of these represented distinct families of the Sabellii.

Stephen Robert Morse

Stephen Robert Morse is a New York-born, London-based filmmaker. He is known for producing the Primetime Emmy Awards-nominated "Amanda Knox", and directing/producing "EuroTrump", focusing on Geert Wilders. Along with his business partner Max Peltz, Morse earned a 42nd News &amp; Documentary Emmy Awards nomination for writing the documentary "In the Cold Dark Night". Morse and Peltz together serve as Managing Directors of Lone Wolf Studios.
Career.
Education.
Morse studied at the University of Pennsylvania and worked for "Mother Jones" after graduation. He graduated with an MBA from the University of Oxford's Saïd Business School.
Early work.
At the University of Pennsylvania, he directed and produced the feature documentary "Ain't Easy Being Green," made on a budget of grants worth $5,000, about the 2006 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania and "Duet," a short film about street musician and future star of The Voice (U.S. season 8) Anthony Riley.
In 2008, he shot a video of the New Black Panthers blocking the entrance to a polling location with a strong Democratic majority in Philadelphia during the 2008 United States Elections. The video was posted on YouTube and went viral with over a million views, prompting a Congressional investigation. Morse subsequently regretted the video's success, as it was regularly repeated on Fox News early in Barack Obama's presidential career. This allowed 2016 presidential candidate Donald Trump to warn Pennsylvania voters to watch out for fraud from Democratic supporters, a charge that Morse refuted, citing that the incident he witnessed was isolated. The Philadelphia incident became known as the New Black Panther Party voter intimidation case.
MyTwoCensus: 2010 Census Watchdog.
In February 2009, Morse founded MyTwoCensus, a non-partisan, political watchdog group for the 2010 U.S. Census.
Skillbridge.
Morse also co-founded the graduate consultancy group Skillbridge, which was sold to Toptal in 2016.
Amanda Knox.
In 2016, Morse produced the Netflix documentary "Amanda Knox". Morse started making the film while he was an Erasmus Mundus journalism student in 2011.
The documentary covers Knox's life and wrongful prison sentence for murder and her subsequent acquittal. Morse was nominated for an Emmy Award for "Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special".
EuroTrump.
Along with co-director Nick Hampson and co-writer Maria Springer, Morse produced "EuroTrump", a film about the right-wing Dutch politician Geert Wilders, who has been compared to Trump. Morse managed to gain Wilders' trust following his work on "Amanda Knox"; though he did not personally agree with Wilders on many issues, he felt it was important to respect them in order to find out more about Wilders' politics. He was given permission to film Wilders during campaigning for the 2017 Dutch general election, and consequently gained more access to Wilders than other news organizations. The film was released shortly after the Dutch elections at the Sheffield Documentary Festival as “Wilders” in June 2018. But after this screening, Morse, believing in the Japanese concept of Kaizen, known in English as continuous improvement, added many additional edits to the film that was then rebranded as EuroTrump. The film discusses the rise of Twitter in politics, as Morse shows how Wilders bypasses traditional forms of media to go straight to "the people." The film begins with Morse soliciting Wilders' involvement. Morse has said that Wilders is "actually much smarter than Trump" and "knows what he's doing". The film was screened at the International Film Festival in Ferrara, Italy. "EuroTrump" was subsequently released on Amazon and Hulu in the United States on June 30, 2018.
Koch Brothers Projects.
In August, 2019, Variety reported that Morse purchased scripted and non-fiction rights to Daniel Schulman's book "Sons of Wichita" on the Koch Brothers.
In the Cold Dark Night.
On July 14, 2020, "Entertainment Weekly" reported that Morse directed, produced, and wrote "In the Cold Dark Night", a documentary on the racist murder of Timothy Coggins and its 35-year aftermath. Morse and the film were nominated for a 2021 Emmy Award in the Outstanding Writing: Documentary category. 
Bad Hombres.
Morse produced "Bad Hombres", a documentary on the world's only bi-national sports team, the Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos, a Mexican professional baseball team that plays half of their home games across the border in Texas. The film premiered on "Showtime Networks" in 2020.
Style.
Morse has said that working effectively with small budgets and limited time are important in making modern documentaries that deliver impact, as 24-hour news coverage and the rise of social media means that documentaries must cover ground quickly. This was why he initially released EuroTrump, originally called Wilders, only three months after the Dutch elections. He believes in a no frills approach to making documentaries while maintaining the highest quality in productions. Commenting on "EuroTrump", he said, "We only shoot the scenes we need, and never use more crew than we absolutely have to."

2018 Donegal Senior Football Championship

The 2018 Donegal Senior Football Championship was the 96th official edition of Donegal GAA's premier Gaelic football tournament for senior graded clubs in County Donegal. Sixteen teams compete with the winner representing Donegal in the Ulster Senior Club Football Championship. The championship begins with four groups of four and continues with a knock-out format. The draws were made on 24 March 2018.
Kilcar were the defending champions after they defeated Naomh Conaill of Glenties 0-7 to 0-4 in the 2017 final. However, the club had to play the competition without two of its county stars, Patrick McBrearty and Ryan McHugh. On 26 September 2018, it was announced that McHugh had accepted medical advice and would be sidelined for the remainder of the year due to concussion. His injury came while playing for his club in a challenge match against Dublin champions St Vincents in Cavan in late August 2018 — he received a blow to the head during that match. Concussion had also caused McHugh to spend six weeks on the sideline following a 2018 National Football League game (against Kildare or Tyrone depending on which report you read) earlier that year. The injury meant he could take no part in the 2018 Donegal Senior Football Championship (of which his club were the defending champions), news which was worsened when taken in the context of the earlier loss of McHugh's club and county teammate McBrearty to a cruciate ligament injury.
This was Milford's return to the senior grade after relegation in the mid-1990s after claiming the 2017 Donegal I.F.C. title.
On 21 October 2018, Gaoth Dobhair claimed their 15th S.F.C. title when defeating Naomh Conaill of Glenties by 0-17 to 1-7 at MacCumhaill Park.
Burt were relegated back to the 2019 I.F.C. after just two seasons in the top-flight when losing their Relegation Final to newly promoted Milford.
Team changes.
The following teams changed division since the 2017 championship season. 
To S.F.C..
Promoted from 2017 Donegal I.F.C.
From S.F.C..
Relegated to 2018 Donegal I.F.C.
Format.
The 2018 County Championship took the same format as previous championships in which there was four groups of four with the top two qualifying for the quarter-finals. Bottom of each group play in relegation play-offs to decide which team is relegated the 2019 Intermediate championship.
Group stage.
All 16 teams entered the competition at this stage. The top 2 teams in each group advanced to the Quarter-Finals while the bottom team of each group entered a Relegation Playoff. This year, all teams played one home match, one away match and one match at a neutral venue.
