Early life.
Lucille Foster was born near Shreveport, Louisiana, the daughter of Capt. James Martin Foster and Ellen Long Foster. Her mother was the first president of the Louisiana Federation of Women's Clubs. Lucille Foster attended the Mary Baldwin Seminary in Virginia, with further studies in New York and Paris.
Career.
Lucille Foster McMillin campaigned with her husband Benton McMillin for statewide and national office, traveling and giving speeches to women's groups, although Tennessee women did not yet have access to the ballot. When Benton McMillin was appointed ambassador to Guatemala, she lived in Guatemala; when he became ambassador to Peru, she moved with him to Lima, Peru, for seven years. As her husband returned to private life in his later years, Lucille Foster McMillin remained active in political life.

She wrote several reports during her tenure on the commission: "Women in the Federal Service" (1938), addressing married women's employment, training opportunities, and the history of women in civil service, including war work; "The First Year: A Study of Women's Participation in Federal Defense Activities" (1941), and "The Second Year: A Study of Women's Participation in War Activities of the Federal Government" (1943). She also traveled and lectured as a commissioner, often speaking to women's organizations about federal employment.
She resigned her federal post in 1946, citing health demands.

Fatima Rushdi

Fatima Rushdi (1908-1996) was an Egyptian actress, singer, film director, and producer who was one of the pioneers of Egyptian cinema.
Life.
Born in Alexandria, Fatima Rushdi moved to Cairo at 14 to become an actress. Without any formal training, and speaking only Arabic, she started her own theatrical troupe in 1926 and travelled throughout North Africa. Theater director `Aziz `Id fell in love with her and enabled her to learn to read and write. She became known as the "Bernhardt of the Orient" for reprising many of Sarah Bernhardt's famous roles, including Mark Anthony in "Julius Caesar".
In the late 1920s, Rushdi went on acting tours abroad. She acted in Beirut, Jaffa, Haifa, Latakia, Baghdad, and in Tunisia and Algeria. She also sailed to South America and acted in Santos, São Paolo, Rio de Janeiro, and Buenos Aires.
Her first film appearance was in Ibrahim Lama's "Faji`a Fawq Al-Haram" in 1928. In 1933, she directed her first and only film, "al-Zarwaj", which premiered in Paris. No surviving copies are known, and in her 1970 memoir, she claimed to have burned the completed film. In the film, she starred as a woman pushed into an unhappy marriage by her father who dies tragically at the end. 
She acted in several films by Kamal Selim, including the realist film The Will "al-`Azima" (1939), where she played a young working-class girl falling in love with the neighbour's son. Her last screen appearance was in 1955, in a secondary role in Ahmad Diya` al-Din's "Da`uni A`ish" / "Let Me Live".
In the 1960s, Rushdi hosted a salon for filmmakers and students at the Cairo Higher Institute for Drama Studies.

Wordsum

Wordsum is a 10-item vocabulary test that has been included as an item on the General Social Survey (GSS) in most survey years since 1974. Each of the test's items ranges in difficulty from very easy to very difficult. It is widely used in research in the social and behavioral sciences. It is taken by about 1,000 people in each year in which it is included as part of the GSS. Its administration involves showing respondents a card containing 10 words, and then asking them to find the synonym for each of them out of a set of five choices. Although most researchers have implicitly assumed that each item on the test deserves equal weight, its validity can be improved by considering the variance for each word separately.

Zotrix

Zotrix is a twin-stick shooter video game developed by Zero Bit games and released on Windows in 2015 and on PlayStation 4 in 2016. A sequel, "Zotrix 2", was announced in 2016, but not released as of 2019.
Reception.
The game received mixed reviews upon release. Its PlayStation 4 version holds 56/100 on Metacritic based on 8 reviews. 4players.de gave it 76/100 stating "When it comes to dualstick shooters you don't have to ask me twice. Nonetheless "Zotrix" isn't love at first sight. But if you get used to the quirky arcady feel à la "Galaga" where positioning is as important as reflexes you might develop an interesting friendship."

Emily Nokes

Emily Nokes is a writer, artist, music critic and musician. She has been the singer of the feminist pop-punk band Tacocat since 2007. She is also the music editor for Bust Magazine, and the former music editor at The Stranger from 2012 to 2015.
Early life.
Nokes is from Butte, Montana and started writing songs when she was a child.
She moved to Seattle when she was 19 to become a graphic designer. She attended The Seattle Art Institute where she met the bandmates who would later form Tacocat.
Career.
Music.
Nokes is the lead singer, tambourine player and a songwriter for Tacocat. Her creative process involves writing down snippets of ideas in a notebook and workshopping them with other bandmates into full songs.When it’s time to start making new music, my bandmates usually get together and hash together instrumental ideas that they’ll show me via phone recording or practice jam. I then just start thinking about melodies and seeing if any of the lyrics fit, keeping the feeling of the music versus the feeling of the lyrics in mind, though I don’t mind (and sometimes prefer) sad-sounding music paired with silly lyrics or upbeat music paired with darker lyrics. It’s a fun little jigsaw puzzle for each song! Sometimes it snaps together right away, sometimes you have to tinker with it for weeks.As part of Tacocat, Nokes has received recognition from peers and critics alike, including The Seattle Times, Pitchfork and the AV Club. La Sera's Katy Goodman has called Tacocat "the best band in the world."
Politics.
Nokes identifies as a feminist and her songs address topics from catcalling to menstruation. She is an activist for queer, anti-racist, and anti-transphobic causes, especially with regards to art:We need to demand more from everything all the time — for women, for queer folks, for trans folks, for people of color, and for everyone else who lives outside of the standard-issue, mostly-white/mostly-male representation across all platforms of expression.
Personal life.
She is a Libra, has a grey cat named Tinsel, and lives on Capitol Hill, a neighborhood in Seattle, Washington.
She has said that if she weren't in a band, she would want to be a candy taster.

Gauri Maulekhi

Gauri Maulekhi is an animal rights activist in India. She is the Trustee of People for Animals, India's largest animal welfare organization founded by Smt. Maneka Gandhi,Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha. A protege of Ms. Gandhi, she has led successful campaigns for animal rights including campaign against the practice of sacrificial slaughtering of cattle. 
Background.
Gauri Maulekhi started working for People For Animals in Lucknow in 1995 as a volunteer where she played a vital role in setting up the first animal shelter in the city. She also helped raise funds for the shelter, conducted adoption programmes for rehabilitating abandoned dogs and facilitated the coordination of animal ambulance service for animals in distress. From 2004 to 2008, she worked closely with the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) in Noida contributing to the organization's sheltering efforts. In 2008, she volunteered with Raahat, an animal welfare NGO in Dehradun. During this period, she actively engaged in fundraising efforts for the NGO. In 2012, she set up the Uttarakhand Chapter of People For Animals - People For Animals Uttarakhand. 
Maulekhi is active internationally. She lobbied in Nepal to end the huge mass religious animal slaughter at Gadhimai festival. Back in India in 2013 there was a climate disaster when the North India floods were created by unusual torrential rain. Maulekhi helped evacuate more than 6,000 animals from the flooded Kedarnath region. Saving these animals influenced future national policy for dealing with disasters. The plans now incorporate a consideration of animal welfare. Maulekhi also helped the campaign to end the (illegal) wildlife trade at the Sonepur Animal Fair. These acts earned Maulekhi the Nari Shakti Puraskar (National Award).
In 2019 Maulekhi began a campaign to get the government to realise its past commitments to improve animal welfare. She wrote to each of India's states regarding a ten year old directive to form State Animal Welfare Boards. These boards were requested by the Supreme Court and although some were created, others were not. Those that were formed were there in name only as they lacked staff or a budget. In 2020 Maulekhi asked India's Supreme Court to issue a writ to require states to create State Animal Welfare Boards.

Deplatforming

Deplatforming, also known as no-platforming, has been defined as an "attempt to boycott a group or individual through removing the platforms (such as speaking venues or websites) used to share information or ideas", or "the action or practice of preventing someone holding views regarded as unacceptable or offensive from contributing to a forum or debate, especially by blocking them on a particular website."
History.
In the United States, the banning of speakers on University campuses dates back to the 1940s. This was carried out by policies of the universities themselves. The University of California had a policy known as the Speaker Ban, codified in university regulations under President Robert Gordon Sproul that mostly, but not exclusively, targeted communists. One rule stated that "the University assumed the right to prevent exploitation of its prestige by unqualified persons or by those who would use it as a platform for propaganda." This rule was used in 1951 to block Max Shachtman, a socialist, from speaking at the University of California at Berkeley. The rule was not only used against political voices; in 1947, former U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace was banned from speaking at UCLA because of his views on U.S. Cold War policy, and in 1961, Malcolm X was prohibited from speaking at Berkeley as a religious leader. 
Controversial speakers invited to appear on college campuses have faced deplatforming attempts to disinvite them or to otherwise prevent them from speaking. The British National Union of Students established its No Platform policy as early as 1973. In the mid-1980s, visits by South African ambassador Glenn Babb to Canadian college campuses faced opposition from students opposed to apartheid.
In the United States, recent examples include the March 2017 disruption by protestors of a public speech at Middlebury College by political scientist Charles Murray. In February 2018, students at the University of Central Oklahoma rescinded a speaking invitation to creationist Ken Ham, after pressure from an LGBT student group. In March 2018, a "small group of protesters" at Lewis &amp; Clark Law School attempted to stop a speech by visiting lecturer Christina Hoff Sommers. Adam Carolla and Dennis Prager documented their disinvitation, and others, in their 2019 film "No Safe Spaces". , the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a speech advocacy group, documented 469 disinvitation or disruption attempts at American campuses since 2000, including both "unsuccessful disinvitation attempts" and "successful disinvitations"; the group defines the latter category as including three subcategories: formal disinvitation by the sponsor of the speaking engagement; the speaker's withdrawal "in the face of disinvitation demands"; and "heckler's vetoes" (situations when "students or faculty persistently disrupt or entirely prevent the speakers' ability to speak").
Social media.
Beginning in 2015, Reddit banned several communities on the site ("subreddits") for violating the site's anti-harassment policy. A 2017 study published in the journal "Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction", examining "the causal effects of the ban on both participating users and affected communities," found that "the ban served a number of useful purposes for Reddit" and that "Users participating in the banned subreddits either left the site or (for those who remained) dramatically reduced their hate speech usage. Communities that inherited the displaced activity of these users did not suffer from an increase in hate speech." In June 2020 and January 2021, Reddit also issued bans to two prominent online pro-Trump communities over violations of the website's content and harassments policies. 
On May 2, 2019, Facebook and the Facebook-owned platform Instagram announced a ban of "dangerous individuals and organizations" including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, Milo Yiannopoulos, Alex Jones and his organization InfoWars, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, and Paul Nehlen. In the wake of the 2021 storming of the US Capitol, Twitter banned then-president Donald Trump, as well as 70,000 other accounts linked to the event and the far-right movement QAnon.
Donald Trump.
On January 6, 2021, in a joint session of the United States Congress, the counting of the votes of the Electoral College was interrupted by a breach of the United States Capitol chambers. The rioters were supporters of President Donald Trump who hoped to delay and overturn the President's loss in the 2020 election. The event resulted in five deaths and at least 400 people being charged with crimes. The certification of the electoral votes was only completed in the early morning hours of January 7, 2021. In the wake of several Tweets by President Trump on January 7, 2021 Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, and Twitter all deplatformed Trump to some extent. Twitter deactivated his personal account, which the company said could possibly be used to promote further violence. Trump subsequently tweeted similar messages from the President's official US Government account @POTUS, which resulted in him being permanently banned on January 8. Twitter has announced that Trump's ban from their platform will be permanent.
Trump plans to re-join on social media through the use of a new platform by May or June 2021, according to Jason Miller on a Fox News broadcast.
Other examples.
In print media.
In December 2017, after learning that a French artist it had previously reviewed was a neo-Nazi, the San Francisco punk magazine "Maximum Rocknroll" apologized and announced that it has "a strict no-platform policy towards any bands and artists with a Nazi ideology".
Criticism.
In 2019, students at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia circulated an online petition demanding that Camille Paglia "should be removed from UArts faculty and replaced by a queer person of color." Paglia, a tenured professor for over 30 years who identifies as transgender, had long been outspoken on controversial "matters of sex, gender identity, and sexual assault". Conor Friedersdorf, writing in "The Atlantic" about the 2019 campaign to remove Paglia, wrote: "It is rare for student activists to argue that a tenured faculty member should be denied a platform. Otherwise, the protest tactics on display at UArts fit with standard practice: Activists begin with social-media callouts; they urge authority figures to impose outcomes that they favor, without regard for overall student opinion; they try to marshal antidiscrimination law to limit freedom of expression." Friedersdorf pointed to evidence of a chilling effect on free speech and academic freedom. Of the faculty members he had contacted for interviews, a large majority "on both sides of the controversy insisted that their comments be kept off the record or anonymous. They feared openly participating in a debate about a major event at their institution—even after their university president put out an uncompromising statement in support of free speech".
According to technology journalist Declan McCullagh, "Silicon Valley's efforts to pull the plug on dissenting opinions" began around 2018 with Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube denying service to selected users of their platforms, "devising excuses to suspend ideologically disfavored accounts." In 2019, McCullagh predicted that paying customers would become targets for deplatforming as well, citing protests and open letters by employees of Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google who opposed policies of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and who reportedly sought to influence their employers to deplatform the agency and its contractors.
Law professor Glenn Reynolds dubbed 2018 the "Year of Deplatforming" in an August 2018 article in "The Wall Street Journal". Reynolds criticized the decision of "internet giants" to "slam the gates on a number of people and ideas they don't like", naming Alex Jones and Gavin McInnes, and stated, "If you rely on someone else's platform to express unpopular ideas, especially ideas on the right, you're now at risk." Reynolds cited further restrictions on "even mainstream conservative figures" such as Dennis Prager, as well as Facebook's blocking of a campaign advertisement by a Republican candidate "ostensibly because her video mentioned the Cambodian genocide, which her family survived." Reynolds wrote that in contrast, "Extremists and controversialists on the left have been relatively safe from deplatforming," concluding that "the fact that a few corporations can play such a disproportionate role in deciding what subjects are open for debate is a problem" as a matter of free speech.
Some critics believe that Internet presence using social media websites is imperative in order to adequately take part in the 21st century as an individual, and consequently, these sites should be treated as public utilities to ensure that constitutional rights of the users are protected.
Defense.
Supporters of deplatforming have justified the action on the grounds that it produces the desired effect of reducing what they characterize as "hate speech". Angelo Carusone, president of the progressive organization Media Matters for America and who had run deplatforming campaigns against conservative talk hosts Rush Limbaugh in 2012 and Glenn Beck in 2010, pointed to Twitter's 2016 ban of Milo Yiannopoulos, stating that "the result was that he lost a lot... He lost his ability to be influential or at least to project a veneer of influence."
According to its defenders, deplatforming has been used as a tactic to prevent the spread of hate speech and disinformation. Social media has evolved into a significant source of news reporting for its users, and support for content moderation and banning of inflammatory posters has been defended as an editorial responsibility required by news outlets.
The First Amendment is sometimes cited as a criticism of deplatforming in the United States, but according to Audie Cornish, host of the NPR show 'Consider This', modern deplatforming is not a government issue. She states that "...the government can't silence your ability to say almost anything you want on a public street corner. But a private company can silence your ability to say whatever you want on a platform they created." Because of this, proponents say, deplatforming is a legal way of dealing with controversial users online or in other digital spaces, so long as the government is not involved with causing the deplatforming.
Legislation.
United Kingdom.
In May 2021, the UK government under Boris Johnson announced a Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill that would allow speakers at universities to seek compensation for no-platforming, impose fines on universities and student unions that promote the practice, and establish a new ombudsman charged with monitoring cases of no-platforming and academic dismissals. In addition, the government published an Online Safety Bill that would prohibit social media networks from discriminating against particular political views or removing "democratically important" content, such as comments opposing or supporting political parties and policies.

Holly Schmidt

Holly Schmidt is a Vancouver-based artist whose practice moves across disciplinary boundaries, and incorporates pedagogical, collaborative and social practice approaches. She has taught at Emily Carr University of Art and Design, and as an educational programmer at the Contemporary Art Gallery in Vancouver.
Select projects.
All the Trees.
In Fall of 2018, Holly instigated a tree mapping project by tagging 30 trees with ID and an email address in the West Point Grey Community Centre and Jericho Park area. Inspired by the City of Melbourne tree mapping project in which the purpose of labelling trees so that residents could report tree damage or disease by email, the project was hijacked by citizens sending personal notes of their admiration for the trees. Schmidt opened up the same opportunity for Vancouver trees, and with a response email back it will also educate about the different species of deciduous and coniferous trees located in the parks. Schmidt worked with historian John Atkin, poet Rahat Kurd, horticulturalist Egan Davis, and indigenous herbalist Lori Snyder as a part of the Artist in Communities program through the Vancouver Park Board.
Lost Lessons (Midnight Picnic).
Since 2014, Schmidt has employed her father's (a former professor in the sciences) astronomy slide collection that spans over thirty years of diagrams, illustrations, NASA and other observatory photographs and various technical capacities to document the universe. Caitlin Chaisson has described the ongoing series as "stargazing events that explore what it means to be tethered to the Earth". Continuing and supported by a Canadian Council for the Arts grant, a new iteration expanding on the work collaborates with the theatre company Boca Del Lupo.
Grow: An Art + Urban Agriculture Project.
In a public intervention project with Other Sights for Artists' Projects between May to November 2011, Schmidt harvested and engaged local community in a living ecological laboratory in the middle of the city that she called "Grow". In a vacant industrial lot near Vancouver's Olympic Village, Schmidt occupied the space with a living garden that brought people together to share their knowledge and experience in sustainable design and Eco-philosophy. Activated by activities such as the Grow Seed Exchange, walking dialogues with disciplinary experts on sustainability including Designer Duane Elverum and Trudeau Scholar Rajdeep Singh Gill, and drop-in workshops on urban farming, visitors practiced new potentials for growing food against the backdrop of high-end condos that mark Vancouver's notorious housing market. Using social practice methods, the events create collaborative, informal, grassroots interaction that model an alternative social structures in contrast to industrial food systems.
The work evolved into other participatory and collaborative events, such as "Moveable Feast" at Burnaby Art Gallery which featured foraged food and locally found ingredients, honey, spiced mead, fermented beverages, simple cheese making and pickled vegetables. The series provided workshops with underground chefs including Fermented Beverages
Residencies.
Schmidt has engaged in participatory projects on food and food mobility through various residencies, such as the Santa Fe Art Institute Food Justice Residency, Mess Hall at the Banff Centre, Lore Residency at Zocalo Organic Farm in Guelph Ontario, Woodland School with Duane Linklater at Artscape in Toronto, among others.

<doc id="56812702" url="?curid=56812702" title="Pfahl (Bavarian Forest)">
Pfahl (Bavarian Forest)

The Pfahl is a 150-kilometre-long quartz vein that runs through the northeastern Bavarian Forest in Germany. From a geomorphological point of view, it represents a residual ridge that has been formed by weathering and erosion over millions of years.
Formation.
The Pfahl consists of quartz that was deposited as a hydrothermal vein about 275 million years ago within the existing fault structure. The Pfahl was probably active as a fault several times. Because the rock of the Pfahl was harder than the surrounding rock, it was left standing like a wall as softer rocks were eroded. Today the Pfahl forms a residual ridge 150 kilometres long and 10 to 40 metres high. The shining white quartz of the Pfahl consists of up to 98% silicic acid; any yellowish to reddish or grey coloration is caused by iron compounds and impurities ("Pfahlschiefer"). The interpretation of the actual Pfahl fault as a suture is disputed; but it has been confirmed that it separates various magmatic rocks.
Course.
The Pfahl begins in the northwest in the Upper Palatinate, southeast of Schwarzenfeld, passes the town of Cham to the southwest and runs in a southeasterly direction via Viechtach, Regen, Grafenau and Freyung and into Upper Austria's Mühlviertel. The quartz only outcrops in a few places (and not at all southeast of Freyung); otherwise the Pfahl is only recognisable as a ridge. In Weißenstein near Regen it reaches a height of 758 metres above sea level; on this summit stand the ruins of Weißenstein Castle. The quartz formations are most easily visible near Viechtach (west of the town) and here they rise up to 30 metres above the ground. With a few exceptions the Pfahl has survived as a continuous geological formation.
Through the Zellertal valley between Bad Kötzting and Bodenmais another Pfahl-like slate zone runs parallel to the actual Pfahl and in which the quartz does not immediately outcrop. This 'secondary pfahl' is called the Rundingen Pfahl Zone ("Rundinger-Pfahlzone"). Its southeastern outcrop lies near Bettmannsäge southwest of Zwiesel. There is another secondary pfahl in the southeast of the Bavarian Forest, the Aicha-Hals Secondary Pfahl ("Aicha-Halser-Nebenpfahl"), which is responsible for the double bend on the Ilz near Hals as well as a bend in the River Danube to the north just behind Passau. There is yet another one between Kirchberg vorm Wald and Gerlesberg.
Natural region divisions.
The longest section of the Pfahl runs through the Regen Depression. Here there are several, individual, southeast-running residual ridges that are repeatedly interrupted by basins and transverse valleys. From a natural regional perspective, the Pfahl is divided into the following sub-divisions as follows (from NW to SE):
Southeast and on the far side of the Regen Depression, in the Abteiland, the sections of the Pfahl are geomorphologically less obvious and do not form their own natural regions. One notable geotope there is the Buchberger Leite.
National geotope.
In 2006 the Pfahl was added to the list of 77 outstanding national geotopes in Germany.

Cymegesolate

Cymegesolate (developmental code name Progestin No. 1), also known as cypionyl megestrol acetate or as megestrol acetate 3β-cypionate, is a progestin medication which was never marketed. It was developed in China in the late 1970s and early to mid 1980s for use as a hormonal contraceptive. The medication was formulated at a dose of 50–100 mg in combination with a "trace" dose of 0.25–0.5 mg quinestrol as a long-lasting, once-a-month combined oral contraceptive pill. This combination has been studied in 1,213 women across a total of 9,651 menstrual cycles, with contraceptive effectiveness of over 99.13% and "very few side effects." At the high dose (100 mg / 0.5 mg), it showed an anovulation rate of only about 60%, and instead mediated its contraceptive effects via a marked anti-implantation effect.
Chemistry.
Cymegesolate, also known as megestrol acetate 3β-cypionate, as well as 17α-acetoxy-6-dehydro-6-methylprogesterone 3β-cyclopentylpropionate or 17α-acetoxy-6-methylpregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione 3β-cyclopentylpropionate, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. It is the C3β cypionate (cyclopentylpropionate) ester of megestrol acetate. A closely related medication is acetomepregenol (mepregenol diacetate; also known as megestrol 3β,17α-diacetate), which, in contrast, has been marketed.

Kenud

Kenud is a village of the Punasa tehsil of Khandwa district, in Madhya Pradesh state, India. The village is almost three hundred years old. Which was founded around 1700 AD by Joraji Singh Badal (Badaliya - Panwar). Most of the people of the village depend on agriculture, workers and youth are dependent on the nearby city of Mundi and Shree Singaji Thermal Power Project for employment.
Geography.
Kenud is away from Indore, the commercial capital of the state, and from Bhopal, the state capital. Additionally, it is north of the headquarters of Khandwa district, from tehsil headquarters Punasa, from Mundi, and from Hanuwantiya.
History.
Kenud Village was founded by Joraji Singh Badal (Badaliya - Panwar), around 1700 AD. whose caste was Kshatriya Rajput and descendant (Vadaliya Panwar) which later became (Badliya Panwar) and presently his descendants became (Badal Panwar), People knew from different surnames like Patel Sahab and Thakur Sahab.
Those who belonged to the village of Dhodwada and whose ancestors originally belonged to the Paramara dynasty, after the end of the rule of the Paramara dynasty in the 14th century, their descendants and relatives settled many small forts, towns, and villages in Malwa Nimar.
Parmar or Panwar was an Agnivansha Kshatriya dynasty of medieval India. The authority of this dynasty was up to the states of Dhar, Malwa, Nimar, Ujjayini, Abu Parbat, and Amarkot near Indus. Nearly all of Western India was a kingdom of the Paramara dynasty. They continued to rule from the 8th century to the 14th century. The root word has different abrasions according to the area of Pramar such as Panwar, Pawar, Powar, Puwar, Punwar, and Puar.
From the middle of the 16th century to the early 18th century, the Nimar region was under the rule of Aurangzeb, Bahadur Shah, Peshwa, Scindia, Holkar, Panwar, Marathas and Pindaris. Later from the 1818 Khandwa district was ceded by the Marathas to the British Raj, and later became part of Central Province and Berar Province. The region to the west, which forms the present Khargone district, was part of the princely state of Indore. And the rulers of all the villages of India were officially made zamindars by the British, and the governance of the village was seen only by the zamindars of the Badal family which continued till 1947.
After India's independence in 1947, Central Province and Berar Province became the new Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Khandwa district was known as Nimar district before 1956, when the state of Central India was merged with the state of Madhya Pradesh in the west. The present Khargone district of Central India was also called Nimar, hence the districts were renamed as West and East Nimar. Nimar district was part of the Nerbudda (Narmada) Division of Central Province and Berar Province, which became the state of Central India (later Madhya Pradesh) after India's independence in 1947. Recently Khandwa was known as Eastern Nimar. On 15 August 2003, Burhanpur district was separated from Khandwa district. Khandwa district is a part of Indore division.
Before independence, the village was headed by ahead of the Badal family, after independence, the Zamindari system also went away with the British, a new constitution of independent India was made and the village was commanded by government officials like - Kotwar, Patwari, Police, District magistrate and other government officers. Adi went into the hands of the people, and in 1992, the villages of India started being governed by the system of Panchayati Raj, the government panchayat is of 2-3 villages and the traditional panchayat is different from each village, in some private cases of the village today. Even the traditional head of the village and the panchayat settle together, but most of the work is done by the government panchayat, currently, the village is headed by a sarpanch who heads the village panchayat.

Clarissimus (horse)

Clarissimus (1913 – after 1932) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was highly rated as a juvenile and showed promise by winning the Clearwell Stakes on the second of his two starts. He recorded his biggest when winning the 2000 Guineas on his debut as a three-year-old. Clarissimus went on to finish second in the Newmarket Stakes and a substitute St Leger before winning the Champion Stakes on his final appearance. After his retirement from racing he became a breeding stallion and had considerable influence as a sire of broodmares.
Background.
Clarissimus was a chestnut horse bred in the United Kingdom by his owner Evelyn Boscawen, 7th Viscount Falmouth. He was foaled on 15 January 1913. The colt was sent into training with William Waugh at the Kingsclere stable in Berkshire.
He was probably the best horse sired by Radium, a slow-maturing stayer whose wins included the Jockey Club Cup, Goodwood Cup and Doncaster Cup. The most notable of Radium's other progeny was Night Raid, who was exported to Australia where he sired Phar Lap and Nightmarch. Clarissimus' dam Quintessence was an unbeaten mare whose six wins included the 1000 Guineas in 1903.
Clarissimus's racing career took place during World War I. Many racecourses were closed for the duration of the conflict and all five of traditional British Classic Races were run at Newmarket.
Racing career.
1915: two-year-old season.
Clarissimus showed very promising form on the training gallops and was highly regarded by his trainer, but on his racecourse debut he was well beaten by the fillies Telephone Girl and Fifinella in the Bibury Stakes ant Newmarket. At the same track in October he recorded his first success in the Clearwell Stakes.
1916: three-year-old season.
Clarissimus performed well in training in the spring of 1916 although his trainer's confidence was somewhat dented when his galloping companion, a filly named Angelina, ran poorly in the Greenham Stakes. On 3 May Clarissimus, ridden by Jimmy Clark, started at odds of 100/7 (approximately 14/1) for the 108th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket. The race was run in "hazy" conditions and the early stages were not clearly visible from the stands although it was clear that the horses had split into two groups on either side of the wide straight. When the field emerged into clear view Clarissimus was towards the front of the group on the stands-side and won "pretty comfortably" by three quarters of a length from Kwang-Su with Nassovian half a length away in third place. The favourite Figaro, who raced up the opposite side of the track, finished fourth of the seventeen runners.
In the Newmarket Stakes over ten furlongs on 17 May, Clarissimus was beaten half a length by Figaro. He had a particularly bad race and did not recover sufficiently to take part in the "New Derby".
After a break of almost four months, Clarissimus returned for the September Stakes at Newmarket, a substitute race for the St Leger. He proved to be no match for the favourite Hurry On but took second place, five lengths clear of Atheling in third place.
In October the colt was matched against older horses in the Champion Stakes and started the 6/4 favourite after the late withdrawal of Pommern. Ridden by the Australian jockey Frank Bullock, he had "no difficulty" in winning from the four-year-old filly Silver Tag.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Clarissimus an "average" winner of the 2000 Guineas.
Stud record.
At the end of his racing career Clarissimus was retired to become a breeding stallion in England where he stood for three years before being exported to France. Although his offspring had little success on the track his daughters had considerable success as broodmares. He was the damsire of Pharis, Brantome, Donatello (sire of Crepello and Alycidon) and Crudite (Grand Prix de Paris). His last foals were born in 1933.

List of Eurovision Song Contest entries

Over 1,600 entries have been submitted into the Eurovision Song Contest since it began in 1956, comprising songs and artists which have represented fifty-two countries. The contest, organised by the European Broadcasting Union (also known as EBU), is held annually between members of the Union, with participating broadcasters from different countries submitting songs to the event and casting votes to determine the most popular in the competition. From an original seven participating countries in the first edition, around forty entries are now regularly submitted into the competition every year.
Principally open to active member broadcasters of the EBU, eligibility to participate in the contest is not determined by geographic inclusion within the traditional boundaries of Europe. Several countries from outside of Europe have previously submitted entries into the contest, including countries in Western Asia and North Africa, as well as transcontinental countries with only part of their territory in Europe. Australia, a country in Oceania, made its first contest appearance in 2015 when SBS, an EBU associate member broadcaster from the country, received an invitation to submit an entry to mark the contest's 60th anniversary.
Each year a date is typically set by which time broadcasters may announce to the EBU their intent to participate in the contest, which can be revoked condition-free up to this deadline date. However on several occasions over its history, entries which had been submitted into the contest by the participating broadcasters following the cut-off date, or which were planned to be submitted, have subsequently not gone ahead. This can occur for varying reasons, including disqualification for breaking the rules of the contest or through withdrawal by the broadcasters themselves. On a number of occasions participation has also been suggested or attempted in countries which are precluded from entering the contest, due to a lack of EBU member broadcaster or for other reasons.

In addition to its five contest wins, the has also placed second fifteen timesmore than any other countryand also holds the record for the most consecutive contest appearances, competing in every edition since 1959. Although it has also achieved three contest wins, holds the record for the most last-place finishes in contest history, having featured at the bottom of the scoreboard eleven times .
Entries (2004–).
The following tables list the entries which have been performed at the contest since the introduction of semi-finals in 2004. Entries are listed by order of their first performance in the contest; entry numbers provide a cumulative total of all songs performed at the contest throughout its history, and a second cumulative total outlines the total entries for each country. Songs which were performed multiple times are counted only once in the tables, with entry numbers for the performances of semi-final qualifiers marked in italics in the respective finals.
Only songs which have competed in the contest final or in the semi-finals are considered contest entries. Submitted entries for the ultimately cancelled are also excluded from this list for the purposes of calculating cumulative totals for entry numbers and country totals.
In line with the official Eurovision Song Contest records, the 1992 entry which represented the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, subsequently renamed Serbia and Montenegro in 2003, is considered to have represented Yugoslavia rather than Serbia and Montenegro; Serbia and Montenegro is therefore considered to have made its first appearance in 2004.
Table key
Withdrawn and disqualified entries.
On a number of occasions entries into the contest have been prevented from competing at a late stage, either through withdrawal by the participating broadcaster or through disqualification by the European Broadcasting Union. The list below highlights cases where an entry for a given country had been planned in a particular year but which ultimately did not occur, either by withdrawal, disqualification or the cancellation of the contest.
On a number of occasions participation in the contest has been either suggested or attempted by countries which are ineligible due to a lack of a participating EBU member broadcaster, such as past media reports of interest by broadcasters in China, Kosovo, Liechtenstein and Qatar. Participation has also been suggested for a number of nations and territories whose participation is currently covered by another country. Potential entries from Wales and Scotland (currently countries of the United Kingdom) and the Faroe Islands (currently a territory of Denmark) have been reported, but are generally prevented due to the exclusive participation rights of the sovereign nation to which they belong. Wales and Scotland have participated in other Eurovision events where the United Kingdom as a whole do not participate, including the Junior Eurovision Song Contest and Eurovision Choir.
Eurovision Song Contest 2020.
The Eurovision Song Contest 2020 was planned to be the 65th edition of the contest, however the contest was cancelled in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A statement released by the EBU following the cancellation confirmed that the entries chosen to compete in the 2020 contest would not be eligible to compete in 2021. As these songs were not performed live in the competition, they are not counted in the running total of entries performed.

Propaganda and Agitation Department

The Propaganda and Agitation Department (PAD, ), officially the Publicity and Information Department, is a department of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) tasked with coordinating the creation and dissemination of propaganda in North Korea. It is the highest propaganda organization in the country.
History of the department can be traced back to the Soviet Civil Administration following the division of Korea in 1945. Agitation operations by the department reached their height in the years after the Korean War.
Although nominally under the Central Committee of the WPK, the department reports directly to Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. The department is currently under the effective guidance of its deputy department director Kim Yo-jong, sister of Kim Jong-un, while its nominal head is Ri Il-hwan. The department has various bureaus and offices under its control.
The department sets guidelines for all propaganda materials produced and all North Korean media is overseen by it. However, in order to maintain its clandestine nature, actions relating to repression of the media are nominally attributed to the . When newspapers are published in North Korea, they go through three rounds of censorship. The first is handled by the editors of the paper. The second and third levels are taken care of by the department.
The department also translates foreign works, which are censored from the public, for the use of the country's political elite.
Organization.
The Propaganda and Agitation Department (PAD) is under the supervision of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). It is the highest propaganda organization in the country. The PAD formulates propaganda policy, controls cultural life, and produces propaganda materials. It disseminates "Juche", "Songun", "Strong and Prosperous Nation", and socialist ideologues and indoctrinates both party members and ordinary citizens with them. The PAD uses both formal and informal settings to achieve these goals. Because the WPK has a rich history in propaganda, the PAD is quite influential within the party structure. Along with the Organization and Guidance Department, with which it cooperates, it is one of the most important departments of the WPK. Although nominally under the Central Committee of the WPK, the PAD reports directly to Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. The PAD's headquarters are in the center of Pyongyang. The PAD is roughly analogous to the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China.
All propaganda materials are produced in accordance with guidelines set by the PAD, and all media is overseen by it. Limits set for content by the PAD are strict. The PAD controls the press in North Korea, but in order to maintain its behind-the-scenes nature, actions relating to repression of the media are often publicly attributed to the instead. When newspapers are published in North Korea, they go through three rounds of censorship. The first is handled by the editors of the paper. The second and third levels are taken care of by the PAD. Its General Bureau of Publication Guidance reviews both newspapers and other types of publications and broadcasts. The PAD's Newspaper Administration is the final level of press censorship. Likewise, radio and television broadcasts and the Korean Central News Agency are also under supervision of the PAD through the Korean Central Broadcasting Committee, to which it appoints personnel; only the is controlled by the United Front Department of the party instead. The PAD cooperates with the State Security Department and Ministry of People's Security to curtail international broadcasting into North Korea. The General Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Ministry of People's Armed Forces maintains a separate structure, but the PAD cooperates with it. Other partners include the Party History Institute and the Korea Documentary Film Studio.
The PAD has numerous bureaus and offices under it. For instance, the April 15 Literary Production company is directly under the PAD and the company often supplies the department with executives. The Workers' Party of Korea Publishing House, Foreign Languages Publishing House, Workers' Publishing House, and are also under its control. The PAD also translates otherwise forbidden foreign works for the use of the country's political elite. The Korea Film Studios and the 25 April Film Studio are under the Ministry of Culture, but the PAD controls them and their staff.
History.
The history of the PAD can be traced back to the Soviet Civil Administration following the division of Korea in 1945. Agitation operations by the PAD reached their height in the years after the Korean War. They included speed campaigns such as the Chollima Movement and , labor methodologies like the and the Taean Work System, and the .
Kim To-man was the chief of the PAD until his involvement with the Kapsan Faction Incident that sought to oust Kim Il-sung in 1967. Kim To-man had commissioned "Act of Sincerity" – described variously as either a film or a stage play – about the life of Pak Kum-chol without the approval of Kim Il-sung. In North Korean society, this was an inexcusable offense, and Kim To-man was forced to go. Kim Jong-il probably helped in purging him. After this and related purges the PAD shaped the societal landscape of North Korea to allow Kim Il-sung to sediment his rule and become the supreme leader of North Korea.
Kim Jong-il.
Kim Jong-il had entered service of the PAD in February 1966. He was appointed the head of the PAD's Guidance Section of Culture and Art and Publication and Press section in September 1967 after a meeting in which Kim Il-sung criticized those who were associated with the Kapsan Faction Incident. In 1969, Kim Jong-il was promoted the deputy chief of the entire PAD. During this time he not only designed and issued party IDs and oversaw the handling of portraits of Kim Il-sung. In practice, Kim Jong-il ran the entire department because his nominal superior Kim Kuk-tae suffered from ill health and Yang Hyong-sop, who was tasked with ideological affairs, was engaged with science and education policy instead of propaganda. In September 1973, Kim Jong-il became the chief of the PAD, a position which he held until 1985.
Kim Jong-il's years in the PAD were marked by his effort to become an expert in the field of propaganda, as well as him developing his charisma. Kim Jong-il's main contribution in the department was to devise the "monolithic ideological system", later codified as the Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System. Kim's various efforts greatly benefited the North Korean cult of personality. During this time, the film director Choe Ik-gyu, a close confidant of his, also rose in the ranks of the PAD, becoming its vice director in 1972. Choe developed mass games that would evolve into the Arirang Festival, the organizing of which he is still overseeing. Choe fell in and out of favor repeatedly, and finally resigned from the PAD for good in 2010 after being briefly its director. The department was important because of role in mass mobilization. Kim Jong-il was known as a great fan of music, film, and theater since young age and his position within the department was natural fit.
The PAD helped to create a cultural milieu in which Kim Jong-il was named his father's successor at the Sixth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea in 1980. When his succession became urgent in the 1990s, the PAD fabricated a convincing personal history for him because he lacked any true military credentials. He continued to influence the daily affairs of the PAD after his succession.
Kim Jong-un.
Before the death of Kim Jong-il, it was already speculated that the imminent succession would employ the PAD. Kim Jong-un's sister Kim Yo-jong became the "de facto" leader of PAD when she was appointed its first deputy director and put in charge of "idolization projects" of Kim Jong-un. The nominal director is Pak Kwang-ho.

Grand Hotel (Lviv)

The Grand Hotel () is a hotel located in Lviv, Ukraine. It was opened in 1893 and has most recently been reconstructed between 2014 and 2018.
History.
The hotel was commissioned by Efraim Hausmann and was built between 1892 and 1893. The hotel was designed by Erazm Hermatnik while the atlases were designed by Leonard Marconi. After Hermatnik's death in 1893, the completion of the hotel's construction was overseen by architect Zygmunt Kędzierski. It replaced an earlier two-story Empire style building which served as police headquarters and which was the building where Leopold von Sacher-Masoch was born and where his father worked.
In 1893, after its opening, it was also fitted with electric lighting.
Between 1893 and 1895, an outdoor shopping passage, Hausmann Passage, was added to the hotel, with the entrance at the present-day Svobody Prospekt and leading out to the present-day Doroshenka Street and Sichovych Striltsiv Street.
In 1910, the hotel was renovated for the first time by Edmund Żychowicz's architectural firm. In the 1930s, its ground floor was reconstructed.
During Soviet times, the hotel initially bore the name Lviv, and from 1964 Verkhovyna. In 1990, the hotel was purchased by Marta Fedoriv, as a result in undergoing extensive renovations in 1991-1992 and was once more renamed Grand Hotel.
Out of the 25 hotels that were present in Lviv during Austro-Hungarian and Polish periods, the Grand Hotel is one of just two that continue functioning as hotels to this day.
In 2014, the hotel was closed for renovation and reconstruction for a third time. The hotel was expected to reopen as a Crowne Plaza property, although in the end the decision was made to remain under its own brand. It was reopened at end of March 2018.
Architecture.
The hotel was designed in a Neo Baroque style by Erazm Hermatnik with construction overseen by Zygmunt Kędzierski after Hermatnik's death. The sculptures decorating the front façade were created by Leonard Marconi.
The hotel underwent three renovations in its history, in 1910, in 1991-1992 and finally in 2014-2018, though the original design of the building was largely left unaltered. During the second renovation, a stained glass panel designed by Hryhorii Komskyi was installed and was left intact during the most recent renovation. During the most recent renovation, the hotel was also expanded, with an additional wing added.
Since reopening, the hotel is significantly expanded, offering 121 rooms and suites, including one BDSM-themed suite to reflect the fact that Sacher-Masoch was born in a building that once stood in the hotel's present location. The hotel now also features a lobby bar, a 2,500m² spa and a conference hall.

Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia

Slavic-speakers inhabiting the Ottoman-ruled region of Macedonia had settled in the area since the Slavic migrations during the Middle Ages and formed a distinct ethnolinguistic group. While Greek was spoken in the urban centers and in a coastal zone in the south of the region, Slav-speakers were abundant in its rural hinterland and were predominantly occupied in agriculture. Habitually known and identifying as "Bulgarian" on account of their language, they also considered themselves as "Rum", members of the community of Orthodox Christians.
After the emergence of rival national movements among Balkan Christians, the allegiance of Macedonian Slavs became the apple of discord for nationalists vying for dominion over the region of Macedonia. Parties with national affiliations, mostly Greek and Bulgarian, were formed in their midst, largely expressing and accentuating pre-existing social cleavages. From the 1870s onwards Bulgarian and Greek propaganda appealed to them via the creation and operation of national education networks and by supporting the structures of the Bulgarian Exarchate or the Patriarchate of Constantinople respectively. Amidst worsening economic and political conditions for Slav peasants, the clandestine Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, founded in 1893, gained a wide following with a program of agrarian reform imposed by terror, culminating in the staging of the Ilinden uprising of 1903, which was swiftly suppressed by the Ottomans. An armed clash ensued within Slav communities resistant to national proselytization, with IMRO komitadjis fighting against Ottoman authorities and bands of Greek and Serbian nationalists until the pacification imposed after the Young Turk Revolution in 1908. At that time the international observers viewed the majority of them as Bulgarian.
Following the partition of the Ottoman lands of the region of Macedonia between Balkan nation-states after the conclusion of the Balkan Wars in 1913, many Slavic-speaking inhabitants of the regions annexed by Greece and the Kingdom of Serbia emigrated to Pirin Macedonia and other parts of Bulgaria.
Language, economy, and society.
In the region of Macedonia, Greek-speakers were concentrated in a littoral zone, covering the southern parts of contemporary Greek Macedonia, southwards of the cities of Kastoria, Edessa, and Serres. To the north of this imaginary line, Greek was spoken regularly in the cities, while in the countryside most Christians were Slav-speakers. From the mid-eighteenth till the mid-nineteenth century Greek-, Vlach- and Albanian-speakers migrated under Albanian pressure from Epirus to Macedonia, forming new villages or settling in Slav-speaking existing ones, and were linguistically assimilated in most cases. Slavic-speakers, predominating in the rural parts of the region, laboured in Turkish chifliks in the plains or inhabited free mountainous villages and worked as itinerant specialized craftsmen, e.g. builders, across the Balkan peninsula. Only a few populated the region's urban centers, until the growing stream of migration from the countryside to the cities over the nineteenth century. As happened in the case of Vlachs, Slavs migrants to the cities usually adopted Greek culture and were married into other groups of Orthodox Christians.
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Slav peasants identified themselves based on belonging to their family, village, or local region or as "Rum", i.e. members of the Rum millet, the Greek-dominated politico-religious community of Orthodox Christians. The Slavs of Macedonia generally referred to themselves and were known as "Bulgarians". The word "Bulgar" invoked the idea of a poor, Slav-speaking peasant, the stereotypical negative image of the labourers of lowland chiftliks as dull and uncivilized. As it described their actual socio-economic status, the term "Bulgar" could be used as a term of identification in tandem with "Rum", which denoted membership in the community of Orthodox Christians and implied the aspiration of elevation to the higher social status of cultured Hellenized urbanites.
By the early years of the nineteenth century, peasant communities of Macedonia experienced the formation of deep divisions between various social and professional groups over the appointment of community leaders and the allocation of natural resources.
National antagonisms.
During the Greek War of Independence two revolts erupted in southern Macedonia with considerable peasant support. In 1821 an insurrection under the leadership of monks of Mount Athos had limited success and only two groups of villages from the Chalkidiki peninsula were involved in it. The insurrection of Naousa, Imathia the next year, led by local notables and warlords, was joined by ca 2,000 Greek- and Slav-speakers from the surrounding villages. Both uprisings were characterized by the absence of concrete planning and demands from the revolutionaries, other than a desire for freedom and putting an end to Muslim rule, and were suppressed in a short time. A considerable number of Slavs from Macedonia, amounting to a few hundreds, continued fighting, imbued with religious sentiment, in southern Greece as professional soldiers and settled in the independent kingdom of Greece, where they were given land. Their descendants were called "Bulgarians" or "Thracian-Macedonians," and were considered Bulgarian-speaking Orthodox Christian co-nationals on a par with Greek-speaking Greeks, as they perceived themselves.
While Greeks claimed the Slavs of Macedonia as their Orthodox brethren, Serbs and Bulgarians considered them members of their nation on account of their language. Maps and statistics produced mostly reflected their creators' intentions than the demographic reality on the ground, while Ottoman censuses classified their subjects using their religious affiliation further perplexed the issue of their national identity. Rival Serb, Greek and Bulgarian nationalism used religious and educational institutions to tie Macedonia's population to their respective national cause. While a vibrant minority of schoolteachers, priests, and government officials readily espoused national causes, that was not the case with the vast majority of Slav peasants. Alignment of the Slavs of Macedonia with the Bulgarian, the Greek or sometimes the Serbian national camp did not imply adherence to different national ideologies: these camps were not stable, culturally distinct groups, but parties with national affiliations, described by contemporaries as "sides", "wings", "parties" or "political clubs". The Exarchist movement met with less success in Macedonia than in eastern Bulgarian lands, due to the social and cultural dominance of the Greek bourgeoisie. In the middle of the century, despite the opposition of Greek bishops, many Slav villages adopted the use of Bulgarian in education and liturgical life.
The 1870 firman establishing the Bulgarian Exarchate allowed for a diocese to join the Exarchate, given the support of 2/3 of its flock. Ecclesiastical allegiance was treated as a declaration of one's national identity. From 1870 until 1913 the national affiliation of the Orthodox Slavs of Macedonia became the locus of a contest between Greece and Bulgaria, who intensified their national educational activity in the region of Macedonia, alongside Serbia. In the 1870s, Serbs directed their attentions to Macedonia, due to their interest in the area of Kosovo and after the frustration of hopes of acquiring Bosnia-Herzegovina, once it was occupied by Austria-Hungary in 1878. Serbian intellectuals denied the Bulgarian identity of Macedonian Slavs, based on the differences between eastern and western Bulgarian dialects, and suggested they should be incorporated in Serbia. For Slav peasants, however, the choice between the Patriarchate and the Exarchate was not tainted with national meaning, but was a choice of Church or millet. Thus, adherence to the Bulgarian national cause was going against notions of the sanctity of the Greek language, but was attractive as a means of opposing oppressive Christian chiflik owners and urban merchants, who usually identified with the Greek nation, as a way to escape arbitrary taxation by Patriarchate bishops, via shifting allegiance to the Exarchate and on account of the free (and, occasionally, even subsidized) provision of education in Bulgarian schools. The Greek party initially relied on the traditional appeal of belonging to the Rum millet and the authority of its prelates, on Greek cultural and educational hegemony, and on cooperation with Ottoman authorities. Bulgarian nationalists had taken a lead, and as traditional means of exertion of influence by Greek nationalists proved insufficient, the Greek efforts after 1878 were directed to the middle and southern parts of Macedonia, investing in the opening of Greek schools and subsidizing education in Greece, while from 1882 Greece opened consulates that operated as centers of Greek national propaganda. Despite the emergence and propagation of national ideologies, the worldview of most Slav peasants in Macedonia was marked by pre-national concerns, and characterized by the fundamental rift between Christian subjects and Muslim overlords.
Armed confrontation (1893–1908).
Towards the end of the nineteenth century living conditions of labourers in the chiftliks deteriorated, after their Turkish owners became indebted to Greek and Jewish merchants and sold their estates. while economic divisions in the free villages deepened between poor small landholders and the wealthier notables, known as "çorbacı", who usually allied with Turkish authorities and the Greek bishop and sided with the Greek party. Economic misery and political friction led many peasants to emigration to the New World or to neighbouring countries, especially Bulgaria, whence they returned proselytised to the national cause.
As prospects of social mobility cultivated by the expanded provision of education were frustrated, a number of teachers and urban professions influenced by socialist ideas formed in 1893 in Salonica a secret revolutionary organization aiming to gain political autonomy for the region of Macedonia. After some name changes, it became known as the "Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization", and oriented its energies towards engaging traditional brigands and peasants in building a network of parallel institutions in Slav Macedonian villages, facing Ottoman repression and employing means of terror to cement its base. IMRO gained a mass following of peasants who attached themselves to its cause for social reasons, reaping short-term benefits by upper social strata, thanks to threat of violence by armed IMRO bands, and enchanted by the long-term promise of social reform, in particular radical agrarian reform. Having gained a stronghold in the area and having received the promise of Bulgarian intervention, the IMRO staged an anti-Ottoman rebellion, centered around the wealthy free villages of Western Macedonia, on 20 July (O.S.) 1903. The rebellion was brutally suppressed by the Ottomans; tens of villages, mostly in the Manastir Vilayet, were razed to the ground and thousands of uninvolved peasants sought refuge to the mountains.
The passivity of Bulgaria during the Ilinden revolt fostered separatist tendencies within the IMRO and Bulgaria intensified its efforts to infiltrate and gain a hold of its clandestine network. Moreover, following the Murzsteg Agreement, article 3 of which stipulated the administrative reorganization with a view to a better grouping of different nationalities, the governments of both Greece and Bulgaria began to organize missions of armed nationalist guerrilla bands to Macedonia, composed mostly of Cretans in the Greek case. Most Greek-speaking villages remained uninvolved in the Macedonian Struggle, which developed as a confrontation between opposing national factions mostly within the Christian Slav-speaking communities of Macedonia, leading contemporary observers to describe it as a "civil war among Christians". The infighting tore apart these communities, as IMRO komitadjis and rival members of Greek bands were connected with social or even family ties. Under the pressure of armed nationalist bands, individuals and entire communities in the Slavic-speaking parts of Macedonia were obliged to repeatedly shift their stated national affiliation. Rejecting such criteria as language or race, the Greek view appealed to the "national consciousness" of non-Greeks. In practice, this translated to the Slav peasant's confessional affiliation to the Greek-Orthodox millet. Facing a population largely indifferent to national ideas, the employment of violent means by Greek guerrillas in a manner equally relentless to that of the IMRO bands managed to restrict IMRO terrorist activities.
Serbia offered material support to the Ilinden Uprising, and after its suppression, authorities in Belgrade sought but failed to negotiate with Bulgarian leaders on sending Serbian bands into Macedonia for combined action. A Serbian Committee also had funded small groups of chetniks, either self-organized or part of the Bulgarian revolutionary organizations active in Macedonia (IMRO and SMAC) in spring of 1904. Soon, hostility between the Bulgarian organizations and the Serbian Chetnik Organization began. With the failed idea of joint actions, and growing nationalism, the government in Belgrade took over the activities of the organization.
The Young Turk Revolution in 1908 imposed a temporary stop to all guerrilla actions in Macedonia.
Second Constitutional Era (1908–1912).
The Second Constitutional Era established shortly after the 1908 Young Turk Revolution led to the restoration of the constitution of 1876. After the Revolution armed factions laid down their arms and joined the legal struggle. The Bulgarian community founded the Peoples' Federative Party (Bulgarian Section) and the Union of the Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs and participated in Ottoman elections. Some prominent Ottoman Greeks and Serbs also served as Ottoman Parliamentary Deputies. Soon the Turkish nationalism came to grow, and the Young Turks sought to suppress the national aspirations of the various minorities in the Empire. During the Balkan Wars of 1912–13, the Ottoman Empire lost most of its European territories inhabited by Christian minorities.
According to Encyclopædia Britannica 1911 Edition, at the beginning of the 20th century the Slavs constituted the majority of the population of Macedonia. There were 1,300,000 Orthodox Christians, 800,000 Muslims and 75,000 Jews, by a total population of ca. 2,200,000 people. The Slavs were 1,150,000, of which 1,000,000 were Orthodox. Whether the majority of the Orthodox Slavs considered themselves to be Bulgarians then is difficult to answer. Some authors maintain only the majority of those Slavs who had developed some national identity, felt themselves to be Bulgarians, others claim that most of all Macedonian Slavs saw themselves as Bulgarians, or at least were part of the Bulgarian community. As a whole the international observers viewed the majority of them as some kind "Bulgarian".
Integration in nation-states.
The partition of the Ottoman lands of the region of Macedonia between Balkan nation-states after the conclusion of the Balkan Wars (1912–1913) and World War I (1914–1918) left the area, divided mainly between Greece and Serbia (later Yugoslavia). As result part of the Slav inhabitants of the region emigrated to Bulgarian Macedonia. Others remained as a Slavic-speaking linguistic minority in Greek Macedonia. On the other hand, those in Vardar Macedonia were ceded to the Kingdom of Serbia. Many became a subject of process of forced Serbianisation in Serbia (later Kingdom of Yugoslavia), and Hellenisation in Greece.
During the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, the Allies sanctioned Serbian control of Vardar Macedonia and accepted the belief that Macedonian Slavs there were in fact "Southern Serbs". The locals faced with the policy of forced serbianisation. Serbian authorities persecuted Bulgarian priests and teachers, forcing them to flee and replacing them by Serbian. Persons declaring Bulgarian identity were imprisoned or went into exile. In 1924 upon the League of Nations' demand, a bilateral Bulgarian-Greek agreement was signed, known as the Politis–Kalfov Protocol, recognizing the "Greek Slavophones" as Bulgarians and guaranteeing their protection. On February 2, 1925, the Greek parliament, claiming pressure from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which threatened to renounce the treaty about the Greek–Serbian Alliance of 1913, refused to ratify the agreement, that lasted until June 10, 1925. In 1927 Mollov–Kafantaris population exchange agreement was signed and the bulk of the Slavic-speaking population in Greece was forced to leave for Bulgaria. Later the Greek governments began promulgating a policy of persecution of the use of Slavic dialects both in public and in private, as well of expressions of any cultural or ethnic distinctiveness. In this way the leading "Bulgarian community" in most of the area was reduced, either by population exchanges or by change of its ethnic identity.

Iteomyia major

Iteomyia major is a gall midge which forms galls on willows ("Salix" species). It was first described by Jean-Jacques Kieffer in 1889.
Description of the gall.
The gall is a coalesced group of 2–10 hard round galls, on the midrib or side vein and are equally prominent on either side of the leaf. Each gall has a single larva, initially white and later orange or red. There is a single generation each year and pupation takes place in the soil. Females prefer to lay their eggs on the ″broad-leaf willows″ and the galls are found on sallows, or their hybrids, which include bay willow ("S. pentandra"), bitter willow ("S. elaeagnos"), dark-leaved willow ("S. myrsinifolia"), eared willow ("S. aurita"), goat willow ("S. caprea"), gray willow ("S. glauca"), grey willow ("S. cinerea), purple willow ("S. purpurea"), tea-leaved willow ("S. phylicifolia") and woolly willow ("S. lanata").
Similar species.
"Iteomyia capreae" galls are small, hard, green pouches, up to 4 mm in diameter and, as they mature, have a reddish or purplish tinge. They are not as prominent on the lower leaf surface, having red-rimmed conical pores.
Distribution.
Recorded from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and the Netherlands.

Hosam al-Din Ali Bitlisi

Hosam al-Din Ali Bitlisi Nurbakhshi (died 1494/95) was a Kurdish Sufi author. He was the father of the noted historian Idris Bitlisi. 
According to Tahsin Yazici / "Encyclopædia Iranica", nothing is known about Hosam al-Din's early life; however, he adds that his works bear evidence to the fact that he was well educated and was well versed in both Persian and Arabic. Either prior to completing his education, or after that, Hosam al-Din became a member of the Sufi Nurbakhshi order. The Nurbakhshi order itself was a branch of the Kobrawiya order (founded by Najm al-Din Kobra). Yazici considers it likely that Hosam al-Din became a follower and in turn the eventual successor of the so-called "actual" founder of the order; Mohammad Nurbakhsh (died 1465).
He died in Bitlis in 1494/95, and was buried there.

Megestrol caproate

Megestrol caproate, abbreviated as MGC, is a progestin medication which was never marketed. It was developed in Russia in 2002. In animals, MGC shows 10-fold higher progestogenic activity compared to progesterone when both are administered via subcutaneous injection. In addition, MGC has no androgenic, anabolic, or estrogenic activity. The medication was suggested as a potential contraceptive and therapeutic agent.
Chemistry.
Megestrol caproate, also known as megestrol 17α-caproate, as well as 17α-hydroxy-6-dehydro-6-methylprogesterone 17α-caproate or as 17α-hydroxy-6-methylpregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione 17α-caproate, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. It is the C17α caproate (hexanoate) ester of megestrol. Closely related medications include megestrol acetate (MGA; megestrol 17α-acetate), acetomepregenol (megestrol 3β,17α-diacetate), and cymegesolate (megestrol 17α-acetate 3β-cypionate). In addition to MGA, analogues of MGC include chlormadinone caproate, gestonorone caproate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone caproate, and methenmadinone caproate.

Dorothea Melis

Dorothea Melis (born Dorothea Voigt: 22 February 1938 – 29 June 2015) was a German fashion journalist.
Life.
Early years.
Dorothea Voigt was born in Berlin. Her father worked as an architect. She grew up with her family in Berlin's Weissensee quarter, ending up after the war in the Soviet occupation zone, which would be relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). She studied fashion and design at the . At the end of the course students were required to submit a dissertation. Voigt completed her degree in 1960 with a dissertation that was savagely critical of East Germany's popular fashion magazine, which had been founded in 1956, a few years earlier: she was repelled by the publication's staid fashions, its pathetic poses and its housewifely approach. Margot Pfannstiel, editor-in-chief at , became aware of Dorothea's dissertation and spotted an opportunity. The women met: "I've read your work: it's most interesting. If you know it all with such clarity, then start here. Do [the fashion section] yourself, and make it better" ("Ich habe Ihre Arbeit gelesen, ist ja interessant. Wenn Sie alles so genau wissen, dann fangen Sie mal hier an. Und machen das mal, und zwar besser.") In 1961 the 23-year-old was recruited to the magazine, mandated to create a modern socialist image for women.
"Sibylle".
Dorothea Voigt married the graphic artist and illustrator in 1957. By the time the marriage ended in 1961 it had produced who stayed with his mother after the parents parted. By the time she died Dorothea would also be a grandmother. It was as Dorothea Bertram that she headed up "Sibylle"'s fashion department between 1961 and 1970. Recruiting a new generation of photographers such as, most notably, Arno Fischer, Günter Rössler and Roger Melis, she worked to define a new concept in fashion, based around the theme of a modern, self-assured, educated working woman, integrated into contemporary culture. Sources credit her with having introduced the mini-skirt to the German Democratic Republic in 1967. Despite her iconic status the head of fashion at Easy Germany's fashion magazine was still subject to some of the usual constraints. When she turned up to work wearing an elegant pair of jeans, the editor in chief asked her firmly not to wear "these American pants ... for work" ("... bitte nicht im Betrieb, mit diesen amerikanischen Hosen").
Towards the end of the decade there was a change at the top of "Sibylle", when Margot Pfannstiel moved on, succeeded as editor in chief by , "a party loyalist", in October 1968. Ingeburg Lange, as chair of Women's Commission of the powerful Party Central Committee ("Frauenkommission des Zentralkomitees") was by now speaking out in favour of a switch to a "more popular approach" for the magazine, and the pages increasingly prioritised "arts and crafts" and folkloric themes. The "advice column" section expanded. As the fashion photographer Ute Mahler later recalled, there was nothing so simple as state censorship. "We always did what we wanted. The trouble came afterwards, if we had not aligned our ideas of beauty and fashion with those of the Women's Commission of the Central Committee." The result was a growing level of self-censorship and frustration. Dorothea Bertram left in 1970.
VEB Exquisit.
Dorothea Bertram was a huge admirer of the work of the fashion photographer Roger Melis, and in 1970 the two of them were married. Between 1970 and 1990 – now with her considerable reputation secured in the East German fashion world – Dorothea Melis worked for the upmarket clothing retail chain . The business had been established in 1962 by order of the Council of Ministers, through a conviction, they said, that East German citizens should be able to obtain luxury goods without being forced to involve themselves (illegally) in using . Dorothea Melis was responsible for press and public relations. This also involved organising fashion shows. The company sold high-quality modern clothing, much of it imported, which was differentiated from more mainstream "off-the-peg" fashion products through its sophisticated design concepts and its insistence on high-quality manufacturing. In some ways the business expanded beyond its original niche: sources claim that at its peak, with 44 outlets, it accounted for almost 30% of East Germany's clothing sales by value.
Beyond the change.
After several years during which the winds of Glasnost blowing across from, of all places, Moscow, found a growing resonance in East German cities, in November 1989 street protestors broke through the Berlin Wall. It very quickly became obvious that the Soviet troops had received no instructions to intervene, as they had back in 1953, and the self-confidence of the political establishment rapidly crumbled. A succession of further events led, in March 1990, the East Germany's first (and, as matters turned out, last) free election. reunification took place a few months later, formally in October 1990. failed to compete effectively with western retailers from, which quickly bought up most of its well positioned city centre retail outlets. Some of those who had worked for it proved themselves more adaptable to the changing times, however.
Dorothea Melis's East German reputation initially counted for little in the new Germany, but it soon became obvious that not everyone wanted to forget the "socialist" version of Germany. In 1992 the first edition of Dorothea Melis' book "Sibylle. Modefotografien 1962–1994" appeared, and very quickly became acknowledged as the standard work on Fashion Photography in the German Democratic Republic. She was able to organise exhibitions of the work of photographers who had worked with her for , such as Sibylle Bergemann. She gave lectures on fashion in the German Democratic Republic at the art colleges, wrote more books about the past and wryly observed the present.
Dorothea Melis was predeceased by her second husband. In June 2015 she herself died, on a Monday, in Berlin aged 77, following a long illness.

Triple Qualification

The Triple Qualification (TQ) was a medical qualification awarded jointly by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and the Faculty (later Royal College) of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow between 1884 and 1993. Successful candidates could register with the General Medical Council (GMC) and practise medicine in the United Kingdom. It was a route used by international medical graduates and those unable to gain entry to university medical schools, which included women in the late 19th century and refugee medical students and doctors throughout the 20th century.
Origins.
Before the Medical Act (1858) medical practitioners in the British Isles could acquire their qualifications from a number of institutions including universities, medical and surgical colleges and from the Apothecaries' Halls in London and Dublin. The 1858 Act established the General Medical Council and the Medical Register, and began the process of standardising medical education, qualification and registration. The Medical Act (Amendment Act) of 1886 required qualification in both medicine and surgery for entry to the Medical Register and the three Scottish medical royal colleges set up a combined medical and surgical qualification called the Triple Qualification (TQ). This was approved by the GMC in 1884, and in the same year the Royal College of Physicians of London and the Royal College of Surgeons of England set up a similar joint qualification known as the Conjoint Diploma.
Teaching and training.
The TQ examination regulations required candidates to present proof of having attended approved lectures and approved clinical teaching placements. In Edinburgh and Glasgow private anatomy schools and small private medical schools had been a key feature of medical education since the late 18th century. These were known collectively as extramural schools.
In Glasgow these included Anderson’s College Medical School and the Glasgow Royal Infirmary School of Medicine, which in 1888 became St Mungo's Medical School. The Queen Margaret College Medical School for Women merged with the University of Glasgow in 1892.
In Edinburgh many university lecturers and professors also gave extramural classes including John Barclay, Robert Knox, Robert Liston and James Syme. The first school to offer lectures on a range of subjects was Queen's College, established in 1841. Two medical schools for women latterly formed part of the extramural school in Edinburgh. In 1885 Sophia Jex-Blake founded the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women,(which closed in 1896) and in 1889 Elsie Inglis and her father John Inglis founded the Edinburgh College of Medicine for Women. One of the effects of the GMC regulation was the consolidation of most of the extramural schools in Edinburgh into a formal School of Medicine of the Royal Colleges of Edinburgh, founded in 1895. This school of medicine had a charter, a board of governors from the three colleges and provided a comprehensive lecture course equivalent to that of a university medical school, and became the principle teaching institution in Edinburgh for TQ students.
Curriculum.
Candidates for the TQ were first required to pass a preliminary entrance examination or show evidence of an approved university degree. 
They were then required to complete a curriculum as follows:In addition to the above, many candidates took voluntary additional courses which included sanitary science, histology, botany, psychiatry, dermatology, ophthalmic surgery, diseases of the ear, nose and throat and therapeutics. These regulations were rigorously enforced and exceptions were rarely granted. Doctors who had qualified elsewhere in the world, often with years of experience were still required to complete the clinical elements and in many cases the basic science elements.
Examinations.
The examinations were very similar to those taken in university medical schools. Basic sciences and basic anatomy were examined at the end of the first year, anatomy, physiology and materia medica at the end of the second year with clinical examinations being taken in the final year. The examinations changed with time to take account of advances in medicine and medical education. They came to include anaesthetics, paediatrics, psychiatry, ophthalmology, diseases of the ear, nose and throat, forensic medicine, and venereal disease. From 1968 international graduates from approved medical schools could be admitted directly to the final examination. In 1975 the GMC set up the Temporary Registration Assessment Board (TRAB) , which conducted its own structured examination for international medical graduates, which included an assessment of English language skills. TQ candidates were required to pass this before being granted temporary GMC registration. From 1978 this became the Professional and Linguistic Assessments Board (PLAB).
Candidates who successfully completed the course and passed the examinations could place the post-nominals LRCPE, LRCSE &amp; LRCPSG after their names and could apply for provisional registration with the GMC. After completion of one year of pre-registration house officer posts, they could apply for full registration.
Candidates.
The total number of candidates obtaining the TQ qualification between 1894 and 1993 has been calculated to be 10,246, of whom 9.3% were women. The pass rate has been estimated at 48% in 1890-99 down to 21% in the last examination to be administered by the TQ board in 1993.
Many of the candidates came from countries of the former British Empire, many came from Europe and others from Russia, China, Japan, South America and the United States.
Scottish qualification regulations were simpler than those in England. The examination therefore proved to be a popular route to British medical practice for international medical graduates whose degrees were not recognised in the UK, for refugee doctors or aspiring doctors and for those unable to gain entry to university medical schools. In the latter years of the 19th century, this included women whose entry to British university medical schools began in 1892. Between 1884 and 1909, 7% of those qualifying with the TQ qualification were women, a higher percentage than qualified from university medical schools at that time. Among the women to qualify with the TQ were Elsie Inglis, who went on to found the Scottish Women's Hospitals in WW1 and Dagmar Berne. who became the second woman to register as a doctor in Australia.
Between 1933 and 1938, some 25% of the successful candidates were of European Jewish origin, a reflection of Nazi persecution. Some of these Jewish refugees who qualified with the TQ went on to academic careers in the UK, like Hans Kosterlitz, who fled from Berlin to Aberdeen where he worked with J J R MacLeod, who had, jointly with Frederick Banting, won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of insulin. Kosterlitz qualified with the Triple Qualification in 1938, and eventually became Professor of Pharmacology at Aberdeen University in 1968. He went on to discover endorphins and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society who awarded him their prestigious gold medal.
Following the unilateral declaration of independence by the then Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) in 1965, many of the candidates came from that country.
Controversies.
Throughout its lifetime, controversy was never far away from the TQ, the conjoint examination and the LMSSA (Licence in Medicine and Surgery of the Society of Apothecaries). The TQ had been created out of a concern felt by the Scottish medical colleges that they might lose their status as licensing bodies in favour of the universities and the London Colleges. The universities from the outset regarded the TQ as inferior to their examinations. In 1870, Edinburgh University told Parliament that it had a ‘fully equipped medical school which was operating to higher standards than any of the other award bodies’. Most doctors who had qualified with the TQ pursued a career in general practice rather than a hospital speciality, and many felt that there was discrimination against them entering hospital medicine as they had what was regarded by many as an 'inferior qualification'.
Until the 1960s many university medical students would take the TQ or the Conjoint final exams as practice for university finals or as a fall back in case of failure in finals. It was common for those who did fail university final to then sit the TQ, conjoint or LMSSA. In 1982, seven out of ten Cambridge University medical students who had failed university exams immediately sat and passed the Apothecaries examination, further strengthening the view that non-university exams were set at a lower standard. The view that the three non-university medical qualifications constituted an inappropriate and easy "back door into medicine" was regularly voiced in the medical press.
Despite being regarded as an inferior qualification and in the face of repeated unfavourable GMC inspections, there was pressure on the GMC for its retention, on the grounds that it offered international graduates, and in particular refugee doctors, a British medical qualification.
Demise.
The Goodenough report (1944) concluded that "...the extra-mural schools [are] of a lower standard than other schools in the country" and recommended that all undergraduate medical education and qualification in the UK should be administered by universities. As a result, the Edinburgh School of Medicine of the Royal Colleges closed in 1948. Yet the Colleges continued to offer the TQ qualification. In the 1950s many candidates were British students whose studies had been interrupted by war service, while from the early 1960s the vast majority of candidates were international medical graduates or medical students. From 1979 the GMC required prospective international candidates for the TQ to sit and pass the PLAB examination.
Freedom of movement of workers within the European Union from 1973 began the process of EU qualified medical practitioners practising in the UK without any examination. This was eventually enshrined in UK law by European Directive 2005/36/EC in 2005.
A GMC inspection in 1985 found the TQ examination 'old-fashioned' and from 1994 the Triple and the Conjoint examinations, together with the LMSSA were combined and came under the aegis of the United Examining Board(UEB) which had been set up to by the GMC to oversee non-university medical qualifications. Candidates now sat the same examination, held in turn by each of the three licensing bodies. At the same examination diet they sat written, oral and clinical examinations and, if successful, were awarded the qualification of the centre where they sat. Candidates who sat in Edinburgh were still awarded the Triple Qualification. Inspections by the GMC from 1998 reported doubts about whether successful candidates had the 'breadth and depth of knowledge, the clinical skills and the professional attitudes and values expected by the GMC of UK-qualified doctors'. They concluded that the examination was not fit for purpose and recommended its abolition.
The final diet of the TQ examination was held in 1993. In 2000 the GMC decided that all UEB candidates should be assessed by universities. The last LMSSA diploma was awarded in 2003 and the UEB was dissolved in 2007.

Sapheosaur

Sapheosaurs are an extinct group of rhynchocephalian reptiles from the Late Jurassic period. "Sapheosaurs" is an informal name for a group of rhynchocephalians closely related to the genus "Sapheosaurus". It was first recognized as a group containing multiple genera by Hoffstetter in 1955. The group has sometimes been given a formal taxonomic name as the family Sapheosauridae, although in some analyses this group belongs to the family Sphenodontidae (which also contains the tuatara, the only living rhynchocephalian) and thus cannot be assigned its own family. They were fairly advanced rhynchocephalians which may have had semiaquatic habits.
Classification.
The most well-known members of the group are "Sapheosaurus" and "Kallimodon", and most phylogenetic analyses on rhynchocephalians only study these two genera as representatives of sapheosaurs. Although a few early phylogenies in the 1990s did not find that these two formed a natural clade, the relation between these two is now considered to be more stable, and has been found in practically every major analysis of rhynchocephalians since Apesteguía &amp; Novas (2003).
However, the relation between sapheosaurs as a whole and other rhynchocephalians is less clear. Although they are clearly members of the group Sphenodontia like almost all other rhynchocephalians, the construction of their jaw joints means that they were unable to move their jaws in a front-to-back chewing movement. This excludes them from the clade of sphenodonts which are capable of such movement, the so-called "eupropalinal sphenodonts" such as the tuatara, (formally known as "Sphenodon"), its close relatives, and the herbivorous opisthodonts. They are also generally considered to be more derived (as in closer to "Sphenodon") than clevosaurs and basal genera such as "Godavarisaurus" and "Sphenocondor". The in-group relations of sphenodonts are inconsistent between analyses, so although sapheosaurs may be the sister group of eupropalinal sphenodonts under some methodologies, other potentially more derived taxon include "Homoeosaurus", "Pamizinsaurus", "Ankylosphenodon", the "Sphenovipera"+"Theretairus" clade, and pleurosaurs.
A 2017 study utilizing both parsimony and bayesian analyses found some support for a clade including sapheosaurs, "Vadasaurus", and pleurosaurs. Although the bayesian analysis placed this clade in a large polytomy with various other rhynchocephalian groups and genera, the parsimony analysis actually placed it among the eupropalinal sphenodonts. If this phylogeny is accurate, this would mean that an ancestor of this clade lost front-to-back chewing which was present in an even earlier ancestor, rather than never having it in the first place.
Description.
All known members of the group lived in coastal environments of the late Jurassic in what is now Germany and France. They are very similar to each other, only noticeably differing in certain proportions of the skull. Evans (1988) and Ahmad (1993) have even considered that they may all belong to a single species, although a shortage of good studies and descriptions focusing on this group in particular means that any conclusions on the relationships between different sapheosaurs are uncertain at best.
Skull.
The postorbital region of the skull (behind the eyes) is lengthened and expanded in this group to such a point that it is longer than the preorbital region (in front of the eyes). Although clevosaurs also had skulls which were largest in the postorbital region, they evolved such a feature through different means, namely the preorbital region being shortened. The upper temporal fenestrae (a pair of large holes on the top of the rear part of the skull) are long but fairly thin, a feature also known in "Vadasaurus" and "Palaeopleurosaurus," potential relatives of the group. Each upper temporal arch, which separates the upper temporal fenestrae from the lower temporal fenestrae (on the sides of the skull), is broad. Sapheosaurs, like other sphenodonts, had acrodont teeth which grew directly from the bone and could not be replaced. At least one known sapheosaur specimen (the holotype of "Sapheosaurus") had its teeth completely worn away so that it was functionally toothless. However, it was later shown that "Sapheosaurus" possessed tooth plates similar to those of "Oenosaurus," which was subsequently recovered as part of the group.
Other features.
The centra (main body) of each caudal (tail) vertebra is flattened from the side in sapheosaurs. Sapheosaur vertebrae also had swollen neural arches (the area above the spinal cord) and zygapophyses (connecting joint plates), features also present in "Ankylosphenodon". Some have proposed that sapheosaurs were at least partially aquatic due to some similarities and/or possible close relations to "Ankylosphenodon" (now believed to be convergently evolved) or "Vadasaurus" and pleurosaurs. However, they do not share many of the adaptations that these other taxa possess, and some researchers are not convinced by this hypothesis.

Murder Accountability Project

Murder Accountability Project (MAP) is a nonprofit organization which disseminates information about homicides, especially unsolved killings and serial murders committed in the United States. MAP was established in 2015 by a group of retired detectives, investigative journalists, homicide scholars, and a forensic psychiatrist.
MAP has assembled records on most criminal fatalities, including case-level details on many thousands of homicides that local police failed to report to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s voluntary Uniform Crime Report program. At its website, the group also provides access to an interactive computer algorithm that has identified homicides committed by known serial killers and suspicious clusters of murders that might contain serial killings.
MAP is an outgrowth of a 2010 national reporting project led by Scripps Howard News Service reporter Thomas Hargrove, who wanted to know if FBI computer files could be used to detect previously unrecognized serial killings. The project took first place in the 2011 Philip Meyer Journalism Award offered by the National Institute of Computer Assisted Reporting for outstanding journalism using social science techniques.
Hargrove developed an algorithm that organizes homicide reports into groups based on the victims’ gender, geographic location, and means of death. The algorithm searches for murder clusters with extremely low clearance rates. The algorithm’s identification of 15 unsolved strangulations in Gary, Indiana, was validated with the October 18, 2014, arrest of Darren Deon Vann by the Hammond Police Department. Vann confessed to multiple homicides and took police to abandoned properties in Gary, where the bodies of six previously unknown female victims were recovered.
MAP personnel warned police and local journalists about larger clusters of suspicious female homicides committed in Cleveland and Chicago. The Cleveland Police Department assembled a small task force to review the area’s unsolved homicides following release of the group’s analysis. Chicago Police Department officials told reporters it had found no evidence of serial murders in a wave of unsolved female strangulations committed since 2000.
MAP filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Illinois State Police on December 3, 2015, to compel the state to release homicide data it “no longer reports to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report and Supplementary Homicide Report.” The case was settled when Illinois agreed to release data on hundreds of cases it hadn’t provided to the federal government. After determining Illinois State Police were not counting how often Illinois police solve homicides through arrest, MAP sent Freedom of Information Act data requests to 102 Illinois law enforcement agencies and determined the state suffered the lowest clearance rate in the nation in 2015.
The MAP Board of Directors includes: Eric Witzig, a retired homicide detective and former FBI intelligence analyst, Enzo Yaksic, director of the Northeastern University Atypical Homicide Research Group, and Michael Arntfield, a professor at the University of Western Ontario, where he runs a cold-case society.

Stanisław Witkowski

Stanisław Witkowski CBE (Hon.) (23 April 1883 – 28 August 1957), was an officer, engineer and military industry organiser in the Polish Army, Hononary Commander of the Order of the British Empire. 
Background and early life.
As a secondary school student Stanisław Witkowski was a member of "Association of the Polish Youth "Zet"/"Zarzewie", clandestine organisations fighting for the independence of Poland. In 1912 he studied at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Lwów (Lviv) Polytechnic. There he joined the ranks of the Polish Rifle Squads (organised by Zarzewie), serving in the 1st Academic Company. Following the outbreak of the First World War he volunteered for the Polish Legions, fighting with distinction in the 1st Artillery Regiment. After the so-called "oath crisis" the Polish Legions were disbanded and the legionnaires, including Stanisław Witkowski, were interned by the Germans in the camps of Szczypiorno and Łomża. At Armistice, (which is also Poland's Independence Day) in November 1918, he took an active part in disarming the Germans in Skierniewice, then he enlisted in the Polish Army and went to the eastern front, taking service in the ammunition workshop during the ensuing Polish-Soviet War.
In independent Poland.
He played a prominent role in the organisation of the army of the reborn Poland. In 1922, he organised and managed the Munitions Factory in Warsaw, located in the former buildings of the Gerlach and Pulst Joint Stock Company in Wola (Warsaw), Using obsolete machines, mainly from a German arms factory in Gdańsk, the factory managed to turn out 9.2 thousand rifle rounds in 1923, and 64.6 thousand in the next three years.
On February 1, 1927, he became Division Head in the Armaments Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs. In the same year he graduated from the Mechanics Faculty of the Warsaw Polytechnic.
In 1930 he became Deputy Head of the Armaments Department and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. From June 1932, he was Head of the Armament Materials Research Institute. On January 1, 1935, already as a colonel, he was appointed Commandant of the Military Institute of Armament Technology. Both institutes were R &amp; D establishments, as well was centres for experimental constructions and made a significant contribution to the good organization of the Polish arms industry and its technological advancement. Stanisław Witkowski continued to learn about military technology during study tours in the arms factories of France, Switzerland and Hungary. In 1934 he was the Polish Army's representative on the Board of the Polish-American Mechanics Association, and management board of that Association's Tools Plant (SMPzA) in Pruszków near Warsaw. The President of the management board of that company was Stefan Starzyński, later the heroic Mayor of Warsaw during the 1939 Siege of the City, executed by the Nazi Germans in 1940.
In 1933-39 was a liaison officer to and member of the Temporary Scientific and Advisory Committee
London.
During the Second World War he stayed in London serving in the Polish Armed Forces in the West. In 1940 he was the officer for technical and industrial matters reporting to the Supreme Commander General Władysław Sikorski, and in 1941-1945 Head of the Military Technical Institute in London. On October 4, 1943, King George VI granted him the Dignity of an Honorary Commander of the Military Department of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).
Back in Poland after the war.
Poland was fast becoming a communist country and a prewar officer faced a difficult choice. Nevertheless, in 1946 col. Stanisław Witkowski returned to Poland, where he became the head of the Technical Department in the General Staff, as Józef Kuropieska mentions in his memoirs. Then he worked at the Polish Committee for Standardisation, and in 1953 he retired to become a scientific editor in the technical vocabulary section of the State Technical Publishing House.
Death.
On 28 August 1963 Witkowski died in Nałęczów. He was given a funeral in Powązki, which the Polish Army's Honour Guard attended. The funeral service was also held in London at Brompton Oratory on 5 October 1957.

Maersk Honam

Maersk Honam is a container ship operated by Maersk Line. The vessel caught fire on 6 March 2018 while sailing in the Arabian Sea. Five members of the crew of 27 were killed, including one rescued crew member who died later from injuries.
Description.
"Maersk Honam" is a fully cellular container ship with a capacity of . Her general configuration follows that of similarly-sized container ships with deckhouse about two thirds forwards to improve visibility over container stacks, engine room aft, and container stowage in nine cargo holds as well as on deck. She is long overall, has a moulded beam of , and fully laden draws of water. Her gross tonnage is 153,153; net tonnage 70,694; and deadweight tonnage 162,051 tonnes. "Maersk Honam" is powered by a single license-built 8-cylinder MAN B&amp;W 8G95ME-C9.5 low-speed crosshead diesel engine producing at 80 rpm and driving a single fixed pitch bronze propeller.
History.
"Maersk Honam" was built by Hyundai Heavy Industries in Ulsan, South Korea, as part of a USD 1.1 billion contract for the construction of nine container ships with a nominal capacity of for Maersk Line. These so-called H-class vessels were designed with improved operational flexibility compared to older designs, meaning that they were not optimized for a particular route. The shipbuilding contract was signed on 8 July 2015 and the keel of the vessel was laid on 10 December with yard number 2873. She was launched on 12 May 2017 and delivered to Maersk's Singapore subsidiary, A P Moller Singapore Pte Ltd, on 31 August.
2018 fire.
On 6 March 2018 at about 14:45 GMT, a major fire broke out in the No.3 forward cargo hold of "Maersk Honam" while the vessel was in the Arabian Sea about southeast of Salalah, Oman, en route from Singapore to Suez with a cargo of 7,860 containers and a crew of 27: thirteen Indian, nine Filipino, two Thai, one Romanian, one South African, and one British nationals. The crew attempted to extinguish the fire using the ship's CO2 fire suppression system and other fire-fighting equipment, but were unable to do so. A distress signal was sent at 15:55 GMT and the crew eventually abandoned ship at roughly 17:15 GMT using the ship's life rafts and one lifeboat. 23 crew members were evacuated to a nearby merchant vessel, , while the remaining four (two Filipino, one Indian and the South African) were declared missing. Two of the rescued crew members required urgent medical attention and the other, a Thai national, died from his injuries on the following day. Three injured crew members were later moved to the Indian Coast Guard vessel ICGS "Shoor" after their condition worsened. Maersk Line announced on 12 March that remains of three as-yet-unidentified crewmembers had been found on board, leaving one still officially missing who was later declared dead.&lt;ref name="wmn 4/18"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
On 9 March, the fire on board the adrift "Maersk Honam" had reportedly been brought under control by the ICGS "Shoor" and two offshore vessels, "CSC Nelson" and "Maersk Involver". The salvage operation was led by Smit Salvage. 
The fire continued to burn, albeit controlled, into April, by which time the ship had been taken under tow to the Port of Jebel Ali for the unloading of intact cargo.
To recover costs, the ship's owner declared general average, a long-held principle where cargo owners are expected to pay a fraction of their shipment's value to compensate salvage efforts. The value decided by an adjustor amounted to a salvage security of 42.5% of cargo value in addition to an 11.5% deposit, meaning owners of the remaining cargo had to pay a total of 54% of their cargo's value before being able to take possession of it.
Investigation.
An investigation by Singapore's Transport Safety Investigation Bureau (TSIB) concluded in October 2020. The investigation found that, while no cause was conclusively determined, the fire was most likely caused by 1,000 tonnes of Sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate (SDID), a powerful oxidiser, stored in 54 containers in the No.3 cargo hold. Electrical faults, fuel tank heating, misdeclaration of goods, and another cargo ignition source were ruled out as potential causes. SDID is classified under Class 9 in the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (IMDG), instead of the more stringent IMDG Class 5.1 (oxidising substances). However, the report stated that this classification may have been due to testing of SDID only in relatively small quantities, and the potential for a runaway decomposition of SDID when packed closely in a shipping container could be much higher—particularly if any water had made its way into the cargo. This possibility was not recognized in the IMDG code. Crewmembers responding to the fire reported difficulty breathing, thick white smoke, and the smell of bleach. This is consistent with SDID, which releases thick white smoke and chlorine gas on decomposition. A Maersk uniform recovered from the ship was bleached nearly white from its previous blue color. Combustion of SDID could also have released other gases including trichloroamine, cyanogen chloride, or phosgene, all of which are extremely hazardous. Following the conclusion of the investigation, TSIB recommended additional temperature sensors in cargo holds, specially-designed containers for IMDG goods, and a review of SOLAS fire-fighting standards for container ships.
Rebuilding.
The owner decided to reuse the stern section in a new ship, to be constructed at a South Korean shipyard. The damaged bow section and the accommodations block were removed at Dubai Drydocks for scrapping. The stern section was taken from Jebel Ali to Geoje aboard the semi-submersible ship , which sailed from Dubai in February 2019. Hyundai Heavy Industries constructed a new bow and accommodations block, and the rebuilt ship, renamed "Maersk Halifax" but retaining the IMO number of "Maersk Honam", entered service in August 2019.

2018 Amstel Gold Race

The 2018 Amstel Gold Race was a road cycling one-day race that took place on 15 April 2018 in the Netherlands. It was the 53rd edition of the Amstel Gold Race and the sixteenth event of the 2018 UCI World Tour. The race started in Maastricht and finished in Berg en Terblijt, containing 35 categorised climbs, covering a total distance of .
The race was won by Michael Valgren () in a two-up sprint with 's Roman Kreuziger. 's Enrico Gasparotto finished third, two seconds behind the front pair.
Route.
The race started on Maastricht's "Markt", the city's central market square, and finished in Berg en Terblijt, totaling . The route, similar to the 2017 edition, was made up of four sinuous loops centering around Valkenburg in the south of Limburg. Only the final loop, long, was modified in order to search for more narrow roads. Organisers intended to make the race finale harder for a peloton to control. Maastricht and Valkenburg have been the start and finish locations of the Amstel Gold Race since 1998 and 2003, respectively, and engaged themselves to host the race until 2022.
The route contained 35 categorised hills, usually short but with a varying gradient and coming in quick succession throughout the race. Since 2017, the uphill finish on the Cauberg was abandoned, after it had been the last climb of the race for 14 years. Nonetheless, the Cauberg, the difficult and most iconic passage, was addressed three times during the race. The third crossing of the Cauberg came at to go and was followed only by the Geulhemmerberg at and Bemelerberg at from the finish.
Teams.
As the Amstel Gold Race was a UCI World Tour event, all eighteen UCI WorldTeams were invited automatically and obliged to enter a team in the race. Seven UCI Professional Continental teams competed, completing the 25-team peloton.

Choice Properties REIT

Choice Properties Real Estate Investment Trust is a Canadian unincorporated, open-ended real estate investment trust based in Toronto, Ontario. It is the largest real estate investment trust in Canada, with an enterprise value of $16 billion. It mainly owns Canadian retail properties anchored by its major tenant and majority unitholder, Loblaw Companies, Canada's largest food retailer, which is controlled by the Weston family. It is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
History.
In December 2012, Loblaw announced that it would spin-off most of its real estate properties into a new publicly listed real estate investment trust. The move would allow Loblaw to monetize the value of its real estate holdings, invest in its grocery business, and take advantage of the tax advantages of the REIT structure. On July 5, 2013, the new REIT, called Choice Properties, held an IPO on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Loblaw initially transferred 426 properties, worth $7 billion, to the new company. The mainly retail properties represented 75% of Loblaw's real estate assets. The IPO raised $400 million, and was the largest on the Toronto Stock Exchange that year. Loblaw retained 83.1% ownership in the new company after the IPO, and its parent company George Weston Limited had a 5.6% interest.
In February 2018, Choice announced that it would acquire Canadian Real Estate Investment Trust (CREIT), a diversified commercial REIT, for $3.9-billion. With the CREIT acquisition, Choice owned 752 properties worth $16 billion, and became Canada's largest REIT. The deal was made in part to allow Choice to diversify its portfolio into industrial and other non-retail property. After the transaction went through in May 2018, Choice's assets were 78% retail, 14% industrial, and 8% offices. Loblaw owned 62% of the new company, while former CREIT unitholders owned 27%.
Properties.
Choice primarily owns Canadian retail properties anchored by its Loblaw Company stores. It also owns other commercial properties. As of the end of December 2017, the company owned 546 properties, with a gross leasable area of 44.1 million square feet, and a total value of $9.6 billion.
The company is currently engaged in mixed-use re-developments in several sites that it owns, including at Bloor and Dundas West in Toronto, and the Golden Mile in Scarborough.

Eltzer Hof

Eltzer Hof was a music venue located in Mainz, Germany. The building was constructed in 1742 in a Baroque style architecture on behalf of the Eltz dynasty. During the Bombing of Mainz in World War II the building burnt down starting 11 August 1942.
The three-storey eighteen-axle baroque building with a hipped mansard roof, at Bauhofstraße 3/5 corner Mittlere Bleiche, is listed in the list of cultural monuments in Mainz-Altstadt and together with the adjacent buildings forms a monument zone.
History.
The Eltzer Hof mansion was built 1742 in the Bleichenviertel (bleaching quarter) and shows a simplicity that is rather rare for that time. The parts of the building are divided by rusticated pilaster strips, covered with a mansard hipped roof and decorated only by two baroque portals. Almost 24 years later, the Golden Ross Barracks were built in the immediate vicinity between 1766 and 1767. In 1774 the Counts of Eltz took over the Dalberg-Hammelburger Hof mansion and merged it with the neighbouring Eltzer Hof, since then the Eltzer yards have also been mentioned. In August 1792 Minister Johann Wolfgang von Goethe visited the Prussian statesman Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein, residing there.
Between 1965 and 1970, the yards were rebuilt comprising a concert hall for the Mainzer Liedertafel and used as an event venue for the Mainz carnival, among other things. During renovation work on the hall in 2004, asbestos contamination was discovered, since then the former concert hall was not in operation. In 2008, the Ministry of Finance of Rhineland-Palatinate announced an architectural competition for a "multifunctional event venue". The plans of the Kassel-based firm Atelier 30 Architekten, which won the award in 2009, were not implemented due to the high costs of almost 22 million euros. In March 2015 it became known that the state intends to sell the property in the Mainz government district to an investor who is to create apartments as well as office and retail space there. A study also suggests a cultural use. In May 2018 it became known that a project developer from Montabaur was awarded the contract for €5 million. The palais is to be partially demolished, only the facades are to be preserved. For this purpose, a gap was opened in the façade itself to technically facilitate the demolition.

In older geographical-regional literature the German name "Vordere Bayerische Wald" was applied to the whole southern chain of the Bavarian/Bohemian mountains between the Danube and the Regen, from the Keilberg Depression near Regensburg to the Austro-German border near Passau. Bernhard Grueber and Adalbert Müller described it in 1846 as the "äußern Wald" ('outer forest') "named the Regen Mountains by the geographers". Others chose the name Danube Hills ("Donaugebirge") instead.
Frequently this region was even equated with the Bavarian Forest and contrasted with the Bohemian Forest. Beer, in his work "Der Böhmerwald und Bayerische Wald" in 1925, talked of a "major prelude to the Bohemian Forest“. Even today, many maps only label the lower forest as the Bavarian Forest.
In 1951, the Bavarian Office of Regional Studies ("Amt für Landeskunde") described this region as the Anterior Bavarian Forest ("Vorderer Bayerische Wald") and gave its central highlands the name High Bavarian Forest ("Hoher Bayerischer Vorwald"). As part of the regional division of Germany the term Anterior Bavarian Forest was even exclusively restricted to this area which covered 376 km², which only covered the higher parts of the Vorderer Forest. It became major unit 405 in the natural region major unit group, the Upper Palatine-Bavarian Forest (40).
English sources variously use the names Vorderer Forest, Danube Hills, Vorderer Wald, or Anterior Bavarian Forest.
Regardless of this, the part designated as the "Falkensteiner Vorwald" in regional studies is also called the "Vorderer Bayerischer Wald" in German sources used for tourism purposes. However, the following description is based on the regional structure.
Description.
The natural region of the Danube Hills is only 8 kilometres wide on average. It runs in the typical Hercynian direction from southeast to northwest between the Danube water gap ("Donaurandbruch") in the south and the Pfahl in the north.
The low mountain range consists mainly of granitised gneisses and reaches heights of over one thousand metres. Its highest point is the Einödriegel at 1,121 metres. Other important mountains are the Pröller, Hirschenstein, Vogelsang, Dreitannenriegel, Breitenauriegel, Geißkopf and Brotjacklriegel.
The mountainous region is dominated by woods as well as agriculture and forestry. At the foot of the Pröller lies the winter sports resort of Sankt Englmar. Kalteck, near Langfurth and the Geißkopf and Einödriegel are also important for winter sports. The region is administered by the municipalities of Gotteszell, Grafling, Schöfweg and Zenting. On the Rusel the state road S 2135 crosses the range, whilst the B 11, which originally ran over the Rusel, now bypasses this pass and follows the Bavarian Forest Railway along the Bogenbach. The railway line crosses the Danube Hills at Gotteszell, but needs the 569-metre-long Hochbühl Tunnel to do so.

Fernand Léger Museum

The Fernand Léger Museum, , is a French national museum in Biot, Alpes-Maritimes, in south-eastern France. It is dedicated to the work of the twentieth-century artist Fernand Léger. Although originally privately owned, it is now a state museum entitled to style itself Musée de France.
History.
In 1955, Fernand Léger bought a villa in Biot, called Mas Saint-André, with the intention of installing polychrome ceramic sculptures in his garden, but died soon afterwards. The museum was built on the property after the death of the artist in 1955 by Nadia Léger and , to designs by the architect Andreï Svetchine; an earlier design by Paul Nelson had been rejected. Construction began in 1957, and the museum opened in 1960. The gardens were designed by Henri Fish and contain sculptures based on Léger's work.

Operation Fungus

Operation Fungus was one of the two Special Operations Executive (SOE) exploratory missions to Yugoslav Partisans during the World War Two. Both Operation Fungus and the second mission, Operation Hoathley 1, flew out on the night of 20 Apr 1943 from Derna airfield. The missions' objective was to establish who the Partisans were, who was their leader and if and how they could be utilised to further the Allies' military ambitions. They also served as each other's backup, in case one failed to reach the Partisans or fell into enemy's hands.
The mission consisted of an Anglo-Yugoslav British army soldier Alexander Simić-Stevens and two Yugoslav Canadians, Petar Erdeljac and Paul Pavlić, who were recruited by the SOE and trained in clandestine operations at Camp X on the Lake Ontario, near the US border. They carried two radio sets but no written instructions or identifiable uniform or rank. Prior to leaving, they were briefed by William Deakin, of Cairo SOE, who assured them that they would only be sent if the chances of success were realistic. 
Background.
During the Second World War, both the SOE and its military counterpart, the SIS, operated in Canada and the United States in order to recruit European immigrants as potential agents for deployment in their native countries. The policy was approved as these were often bi-lingual young men who had escaped economic or political hardship in their homelands. Some had even fought in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side.
Once selected, they were sent to Camp X for training and then dispatched to their respective regions. Those intended to infiltrate into Yugoslavia were sent to Cairo, in preparation for the parachute drop. Their main task would be the acts of sabotage on German communication lines and transport of oil, raw materials, troops and war materiel.
The drop and the enlargement.
The Fungus group was dropped "blind", without a prearranged rendezvous into Croatian region of Lika, near . The intention was for them to connect with the local population and try and locate the Partisan troops. Previous SOE intelligence suggested that there were resistance fighters in the area. They were lucky, and shortly after landing they established radio contact with SOE Cairo HQ, confirming that they have reached the Partisan Command for Croatia at Brinje. Erdeljac was immediately recognised as an old comrade from Spain by the Croat commander Ivan Rukavina. Simić-Stevens on the other hand was thoroughly questioned by the political commissar, Vladimir Bakarić.
Once the Partisan leader, Tito, was informed via radio that the two British missions had arrived, unexpected and uninvited, he instructed the Partisan commanders to look after them and ensure that they did not "undertake some provocation which would compromise the Partisans in the eyes of the international public". This was in response to a previous mission, Operation Hydra, which resulted in death of two British officers, Maj Terence Atherton and Sgt Patrick O'Donovan, most likely at the hand of a royalist Chetnik in April/May 1942. In fact, Simić-Stevens, had been Atherton's assistant editor on the South Slav Herald for five years in pre-war Belgrade. For the other two members, who claimed Canadian Communist Party membership, Tito consulted the Comintern, who advised caution.
Simić-Stevens was allowed to contact Cairo regularly albeit under supervision from 28 Apr 1943. The HQ had asked if the Partisans would receive a British sabotage team in order to disrupt the railway lines. After a positive response, the first uniformed British mission to the Partisans arrived on 18 May 1943. The group consisted of Maj William Jones a 50-year-old Canadian, a Scots Fusilier Capt Anthony Hunter and Sgt Ronald Jephson, an RAF radio operator. Jones, a First World War veteran, previously wounded and with the use of only one eye quickly became popular with the local troops.
Activities.
Fungus team quickly became a radio-relay station between Tito's HQ in Montenegrin mountains and the SOE's Cairo HQ who were keen to expand the co-operation. On 17 May 1943, Tito agreed to receive a British mission at Partisan Supreme Headquarters (SHQ) and requested the RAF bomb Axis airfields and garrisons surrounding his troops. The mission, led by Deakin, was named Operation Typical and landed at Durmitor mountains on 28 May 1943, just as the Axis troops were tightening the encirclement of the SHQ, prior to the final push of their Operation Schwarz.
Around the same time, Jones went to Slovenia to focus on sabotaging the Ljubljana-Trieste railway, a strategic line of great importance for the Italian front which offered many good targets in shape of bridges and viaducts. Hunter remained in Croatia, commanding a patrol of L.R.D.G. Later, he moved onto Montenegro as a British Liaison Officer (BLO) to Peko Dapčević, the commander of the Second Proletarian Division. He was most likely the "British officer" who witnessed the Italian Venezia Division surrender to Dapčević at Berane in Sep 1943. Sadly, he was killed later in Normandy landings.

German retribution against Poles who helped Jews

German retribution against Poles who helped Jews were repressive measures taken by the German occupation authorities against non-Jewish Polish citizens who helped Jews persecuted by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust in Poland, 1939 to 1945.
The orders of the occupation authorities, and in particular the ordinance of the general governor Hans Frank of October 15, 1941, provided for the death penalty for every Pole who would provide shelter for a Jew or help him in any other way. In practice, the range of penalties applied to those helping Jews was wide, including fines, confiscation of property, beatings, imprisonment, deportation to Nazi concentration camps and the death penalty. Due to the principle of collective responsibility applied by the Germans, families of those who helped Jews and sometimes entire local communities were subjects to retribution. The exact number of Poles executed by the Germans for helping Jews has not yet been precisely determined. The most cautious estimates give the number of around a few hundred people executed, and the high-end estimates, several thousand.
German anti-Jewish policy in occupied Poland.
In the first years of the Second World War, German policy in relation to the "Jewish question" in occupied Poland was not coherent and consistent. Nevertheless, its fundamental aim was to isolate Jews, loot their property, exploit them through forced labour and, in the final stage, remove them completely from the land under the authority of the Third Reich. An initial plan for dealing with the Jewish population in Poland was adopted already on September 21, 1939, i. e. before the end of the September campaign. On that day, a meeting was held in Berlin led by SS-Gruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, attended by the chief heads of the main departments of the General Security Police Office and commander of Einsatzgruppen operating in Poland. It was then established that all Jews living in the lands, which were to be incorporated into the Reich, would be resettled in central Poland. Mass deportations were to be preceded by removal of the Jewish population from rural areas and its concentration in larger urban centers. In the remaining occupied areas, it was also intended to forcibly resettle Jews to larger towns, especially to those located near railway lines. Moreover, during the meeting, a number of recommendations were adopted, including the creation of "Jewish Elder Councils", the establishment of a census of the Jewish population, as well as its marking and taking up forced labor.
The need to isolate Jews from the rest of the inhabitants of occupied Poland was emphasized by the "Memorial on the treatment of people in former Polish territories from a racial and political point of view", drawn up in November 1939 by the NSDAP Office of Racial Policy. Among other things, its authors wrote that "the task of the German administration will be to differentiate and win Poles and Jews against each other". Recommendations concerning the fuelling of antagonisms between Poles and Jews and other national minorities are also included in the "Memorial on the legal position of German policy towards Poles from a national and political point of view", prepared in January 1940 for the Academy of German Law.
From the first days of the occupation, the Germans treated the Jewish population in the spirit of the racist Nuremberg laws. From September 1939, the occupying authorities at various levels issued orders ordering Jews to wear special bands or identification marks, as well as to mark their apartments and businesses. On the territory of the General Government, this policy was sanctioned by the ordinance of Governor General Hans Frank of 23 November 1939, which required all Jews over ten years of age to wear Star of David armbands. The marking of Jews was also introduced on the territories incorporated into the Reich, but this was usually done on the basis of secret instructions, since the relevant law was introduced in Germany only in the autumn of 1941. Moreover, in the first months of the occupation almost all towns of the General Government and the Warta Country introduced far-reaching restrictions on the freedom of movement of Jews. To this end, measures such as curfew, a ban on leaving the place of residence and a ban on using different means of transport were used. According to a decree by Hans Frank of 26 January 1940, Jews were prohibited from travelling by train. Over time, this ban has been extended to other means of transport. Strict criminal sanctions, up to and including capital punishment, were imposed on those who would violate these provisions.
Germans also took actions aimed at the pauperization of Jews and their exclusion from the economic life of the occupied country. Industrial, trade and service enterprises owned by Jews were confiscated in large numbers. Extensive restrictions have also been introduced in the areas of handicraft production, small-scale trade, property management and money transfer. The legally sanctioned "aryanization" of Jewish property was accompanied by individual ("wild") looting. Contributions and special taxes were also imposed on Jews. Representatives of the Jewish intelligentsia were deprived of the right to pursue liberal professions and were dismissed from work in public institutions. The decree issued by Hans Frank on October 26, 1939 included forced labor for the Jewish population in the General Government. Two years later, forced labor for Jews was introduced in the territories incorporated into the Reich, however, only by sanctioning the state of matters that had existed there since the first months of the occupation.
The next stage of the anti-Semitic policy of the occupier was ghettoisation of the Jewish population, officially justified by economic, sanitary or political reasons. As an excuse to isolate Jews in closed districts, among other things, Germans used the "Easter pogrom" of March 1940, arranged from German inspiration by Polish extreme nationalists. The first Jewish ghetto was established in October 1939 in Piotrków Trybunalski. Over the next few months several more ghettos were created in the General Government and Warta Country, including the ghetto in Łódź (February 1940). Beginning in September 1940, the ghettoisation process became more organized. In October of this same year, it was decided to establish a "Jewish quarter in Warsaw". In March 1941 the ghettos in Kraków and Lublin were established. The process of ghettoisation in the Radom district of the General Government was rather at the latest in December 1941. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet War, the organizing of ghettos on Polish lands previously annexed by the USSR took place. The creation of closed Jewish communities was accompanied by a progressive reduction in the number of smaller ghettos. The concentration and isolation of the Jewish population was also to be served by an unrealized project of creating a great "reservation" for Jews in the Lublin region.
The persecution of the Jewish population was accompanied by a large-scale anti-Semitic propaganda campaign aimed at the "Aryan" population – first of all at Poles. Using the "gadzinowa" press, cinema or poster, the occupying forces tried to deepen anti-Semitic attitudes and stereotypes, which were already widespread in some parts of Polish society before the war. The German propaganda attempted, among other things, to blame Jews for the outbreak of the war and the occupational shortages, as well as to dehumanize them in the eyes of Polish society, e. g. through accusations of spreading infectious diseases (e. g. poster "Jews – lice – typhoid typhus"). After the beginning of the war with the USSR and the discovery of the Katyn graves, the slogan of "Judeo-Communism" was also intensively used. In many cases, anti-Semitic propaganda has found its way into fertile soil and influenced Poles' attitudes towards Jews, even after the "final solution" was initiated.
After the invasion of the USSR started (June 22, 1941), the anti-Jewish policy of the invader was violently radicalised. East of the Ribbentrop-Molotov line, German Einsatzgruppen started its operations, which by the end of 1941 killed from 500 thousand to one million Polish and Soviet Jews. In December 1941, extermination of Jews from the Warta Country began in the extermination camp in Chełmno nad Nerem. By the summer of 1942, all the ghettos in that region had ceased to exist, except for Łódź ghetto. On the other hand, during the night of 16 to 17 March 1942, deportations of the inhabitants of the ghetto in Lublin began to the death camp in Bełżec. The closing of the Lublin Ghetto initiated the mass and systematic extermination of Polish Jews living in the areas of the General Government and Białystok district, which the Germans later baptized with the cryptonym "Aktion Reinhardt". Moreover, starting from mid-1942 the extermination camps created by the Germans on occupied Polish lands became a place of execution of Jews deported from other European countries. By November 1943, "Action Reinhardt" had claimed nearly 2 million victims. Although in the second half of the year the extermination camps organized for this operation were closed down, the mass extermination of Polish and European Jews was continued, mainly in the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp. In August 1944, the liquidation of the last ghetto in the occupied Polish lands – the Łódź Ghetto took place. As a consequence of the German policy of extermination on occupied Polish lands, the majority of about 5.5 million Holocaust victims, including at least 2.8 million Polish Jews, were murdered.
Retribution against Poles helping Jews.
Criminal penalties for helping Jews.
In 1941, the rapid spread of infectious diseases in overpopulated ghettos and the general radicalisation of German anti-Jewish policy resulted in tightening of the isolation restrictions imposed on Polish Jews. While the "Second Restriction of Residence in the General Government" on April 29, 1941 provided for prison sentences and fines for non-compliance with the "residence restrictions" regulations, since the middle of that year Jews captured outside the ghetto were usually executed on the spot – usually based on an alleged "attempt to escape". "The third regulation on the restriction of residency in the General Government" of October 15, 1941 provided for the death penalty for all Jews who "leave their designated district without authorisation", but its sentencing would be the responsibility of the German Special Courts. Finally, in November 1941, the German police authorities issued the so-called Schießbefehl order, which authorised police officers to shoot all Jews who were outside the ghetto (including women and children). After the start of "Aktion Reinhardt" the German gendarmerie supported by collaborative police forces systematically tracked, captured and murdered refugees from ghettos, transports and camps. This stage of the Holocaust, called Judenjagd by the Germans (the "hunt for Jews"), lasted until the last days of the occupation.
Historians estimate that in occupied Poland from 100 thousand to 300 thousand Jews attempted to hide "on the Aryan side". The Germans undertook a number of actions aimed at discouraging Poles from providing any kind of assistance to the Jews. In order to achieve this goal, the occupation authorities skillfully managed to administer rewards and penalties. On one hand, the "Aryan" population was encouraged to denounce and track Jews in return for money or other goods. In Warsaw, denunciators were rewarded with 500 zlotys and officers of the "blue police" were promised to receive 1/3 of his cash for capturing a Jew hiding "on the Aryan side". In the rural areas of the Warsaw district, a prize in the form of 1 metre of grain was awarded. The award for the denunciation could also include several kilograms of sugar, a litre of spirit, a small quantity of wood or food or clothes belonging to the victim. It is known that in the vicinity of Ostrołęka rewards for denunciators amounted to 3 kilograms of sugar, in Western Małopolska – 500 PLN and 1 kilogram of sugar, in Kraśnik County – from 2 to 5 kg of sugar, in Konin County – property of the victims and 0.5 kg of sugar, in the vicinity of Sandomierz – litre of spirit and 0.5 kg of sugar, in Volhynia – three litres of vodka. These techniques did not go without results. In the Polish society there were individuals who, motivated by profit or anti-Semitism, were actively pursuing and then handing over, robbing or blackmailing Jews who were hiding. In Warsaw, the number of "szmalcownik people", blackmailers and denunciators, often associated in well-organized gangs, was calculated at 3-4 thousand. In rural areas there were gangs - usually made up of criminals, members of the social margin and declared anti-Semites - who tracked the fugitives and then gave them away to Germans or robbed them on their own, often committing murders and rape.
The Germans used Polish Blue Police officers to participate in roundups and Judenjagd (search operations). Some police officers attended to these duties zealously, including participating directly in the murder of Jewish escapees. Polish foresters, members of voluntary fire brigades and members of rural guards also took part in the activities. Moreover, Polish village heads, mayors and civil servants were obliged to enforce German regulations concerning the capture of Jews and preventing them from receiving aid.
At the same time, the occupation authorities imposed draconian penalties for hiding Jews or providing them with any assistance. According to Sebastian Piątkowski and Jacek A. Młynarczyk, "a milestone on the road to complete isolation of the Jewish community from the rest of the conquered population" was signing by Hans Frank of the aforementioned "Third Ordinance on Restrictions on residence in the General Government" (October 15, 1941). This was the first legal act providing for the death penalty for Poles who "knowingly give shelter" to Jews residing outside the ghetto without permission. This document also announced that "instigators and helpers are subject to the same punishment as the offender, the attempted act will be punished as a committed act", but stated that in lighter cases a prison sentence may be imposed. The aim of the regulation was clear – discourage Jews from seeking rescue outside the ghetto and discourage Polish people from helping them.
Soon afterward, orders with similar content were issued in all districts of the General Government, signed by local governors or SS and police leaders. In many cases, similar orders and announcements were also published by the lower administrative authorities. The announcement issued on November 10, 1941 by the governor of the Warsaw district, Dr Ludwig Fischer, was even more restrictive than Frank's regulation, as it provided for the death penalty to every Pole who "consciously grants shelter or otherwise helps the hiding Jews by providing accommodation (e. g. overnight accommodation, subsistence, by taking them to vehicles of all kinds".
After the launch of "Aktion Reinhardt" Jews escaped from the liquidated ghettos or from transports to death camps. This led the German authorities to issue another series of orders reminding the Polish population of the death penalty for trying to help Jewish refugees. In this context, one can mention, among others, the announcement of SS Commander and Police Commander of the Warsaw district SS-Oberführer Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg of 5 September 1942 and the announcement of the district chief administrative officer of Przemyśl County Dr Heinischa of July 27, 1942, police decree of the Starosta of Sanok County, Dr Class of 14 September 1942, announcement of the City Starosta in Częstochowa E. Franke of September 24, 1942, order of the Starosta of the Kraśnik County of October 23, 1942, and the announcement of the Starosta of the Dębica County Schlüter of November 19, 1942. On September 21, 1942, SS-Standartenführer Herbert Böttcher, SS and Police Leader of the Radom district, issued a circular to the local administrative and police authorities, which contained the following provisions:
On October 28, 1942, the Supreme Commander of SS and the Police in the General Government SS-Obergruppenführer Friedrich Wilhelm Krüger (HSSPF "Ost") issued a regulation on the creation of so-called remnant ghettos in selected cities of Lublin and Warsaw districts. On November 10, 1942, a similar decree was issued for the districts of Kraków, Radom and Galicia. In § 3 of these regulations, the threat of the death penalty is repeated for people providing shelter or food to Jews who hide outside the designated housing districts. At the same time, unspecified police sanctions (sicherheitspolizeiliche Maßnahmen) were announced against people who do not inform the occupation authorities about the known fact of Jewish presence outside the ghetto (in practice, this meant deportation to a concentration camp). At the end of 1942, a similar decree for the Białystok district was announced by gauleiter of East Prussia Erich Koch. Strict penalties for helping Jews were also imposed in the Warta Country.
Enforcement of German ordinances.
According to the provisions of the "Third Ordinance on Restrictions on Residence in the General Government" and lower-ranking acts, the death penalty was aimed at both Poles who provided shelter to Jews, as well as those who offered money, food, water, or clothing to escapees, provided medical assistance, provided transport or transferred correspondence prepared by the Jew. The highest penalties were imposed on people who helped Jews for altruistic reasons, as well as those who helped Jews for compensation or who were involved in commercial transactions with them. As a result of the invader's principle of collective responsibility, the families of carers and sometimes even entire local communities were threatened with retribution. Moreover, in the occupied Polish lands, the Germans created a system of blackmail and dependence system, obliging Poles, under the threat of the most severe punishments, to report every case of hiding Jewish fugitives to the occupation authorities. In particular, Poles holding positions at the lowest levels of administration (village heads, commune heads, officials).
In practice, the regulations prohibiting aid to Jewish refugees have not always been enforced with the same severity. The “2014 Record of the facts of repression against Polish citizens for the help of the Jewish population during World War II” indicates that those accused of supporting Jews were also punished with punishments such as beatings, imprisonment, exile for forced labor, deportation to a concentration camp, confiscation of property, or fines. Sebastian Piątkowski, relying on preserved documents of the special court in Radom, pointed out that especially in the case of small and disposable forms of assistance – such as providing food, clothing or money to the escapees, indicating the way, accepting correspondence – the punishment could be limited to imprisonment or exile to a concentration camp. However, there are also numerous cases where the detection of the fugitive resulted in the execution of the whole Polish family, who took him under their roof, and the robbery and burning of her belongings.
The Frank's decree of October 15, 1941 stipulated that cases concerning the cases of aid to Jewish refugees would be dealt with by German special courts. Until 2014, historians were able to identify 73 Polish citizens, against whom special courts of the General Government conducted cases in this respect. Many times, however, the Germans refused to carry out even simplified court proceedings, and the Jews captured together with their Polish caregivers were murdered on the spot or at the nearest police station or military police station. Such a course of action was sanctioned, among other things, by a secret order of the SS Commander and the Police for the Radom district, ordering the extermination of captured Jews and their Polish caregivers on the spot, as well as the burning of buildings where Jews were hidden. At the same time, the Germans took care to give proper publicity to their retribution, so as to intimidate the Polish population and discourage it from providing any aid to Jews. For this purpose, the victims' burials were prohibited in cemeteries, instead, they were buried on the scene of the crime, on nearby fields or in road trenches.
Historians point out that Polish blackmailers and denunciators posed a very serious threat to people helping Jews, and in the Eastern Borderlands – additionally collaborators and confidants of Ukrainian, Belarusian or Lithuanian origin. Barbara Engelking emphasizes that due to the relatively weak saturation of rural areas with German police and gendarmerie units, a large part of the cases of exposing Poles hiding Jews had to be the result of reports submitted by their Polish neighbours. Dariusz Libionka reached similar conclusions. However, the actual scale of denunciation has still not been thoroughly investigated.
There were also cases when the captured Jews – under the influence of torture or false promises to save their lives – gave out aiding Poles to the German authorities. Jewish people were also among the informants of German police.
Number of Poles murdered.
The number of Poles murdered by the Germans for helping Jews has not yet been precisely determined. One of the reasons may be that people helping Jewish refugees were often murdered with whole families and hidden Jews. Moreover, in the times of the People's Republic of Poland, no in-depth research was conducted into the problem of Polish aid to Jews. The first major publications on this subject appeared only in the 1960s. According to Grzegorz Berendt, the communist authorities did not, for various reasons, care about comprehensive examination of the phenomenon of aid or, more broadly, about Polish-Jewish relations during the Second World War. The official historiography focused rather on the search for positive behavioural examples, which could then be used for propaganda on internal and international level.
Szymon Datner, the director of the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw, made the first to attempt to compile a list of Poles murdered for helping Jews. In 1968 he published a brochure "Forest of the Righteous. A charter from the history of rescuing Jews in occupied Poland", in which he presented 105 documented cases of crimes committed by Germans against Poles who saved Jews. Datner established that 343 Poles were murdered because of the help given to Jews, and in 242 cases the victim's name was established. Among the identified victims were 64 women and 42 children. Datner's estimates also showed that as much as 80% of executions took place in rural areas. About 65% of the victims were executed and another 5% were murdered by burning alive. The largest number of documented crimes took place respectively in Kraków Voivodeship, Rzeszów Voivodship, Warsaw Voivodeship, Warsaw, and Lublin Voivodeship. In addition, the largest number of victims died in the following voivodships: Kraków, Rzeszów, Lublin, Kielce and Warsaw. Datner also stated that these estimates were preliminary and incomplete, covering only cases examined up to April 1968.
On behalf of the Main Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes, Wacław Bielawski was investigating cases of crimes committed by Germans due to aiding Jews. The archive of the Institute of National Remembrance in Warsaw contains a separate set of over 2,000 folders containing his materials. Based on the findings of the investigation, Bielawski developed a brochure entitled "The crimes committed on Poles by the Nazis for their help to Jews", which in the second edition of 1987 contained the names of 872 murdered people and information about nearly 1400 anonymous victims. In subsequent years this list was verified by the employees of the Main Commission for the Investigation of Crimes against the Polish Nation, which resulted in its partial reduction. The third edition of the publication entitled "“Those Who Helped: Polish Rescuers of Jews During the Holocaust”" (Warsaw, 1997) included the names of 704 Poles murdered for helping Jews. The findings of the Commission's employees showed that 242 inhabitants of the Kraków District, 175 inhabitants of the Radom District, 141 inhabitants of the Warsaw District and 66 inhabitants of the Lublin District were among the victims. The number of 704 murdered did not include Poles murdered in villages, which were to be destroyed by the Germans due to support for Jews. In 2014, INR historians estimated that Bielawski's brochure and the preparation of Those Who Helped... are "archaic", but they remain "still representative of the topic discussed".
On the basis of data collected until 2000, the Yad Vashem Institute identified over 100 Poles murdered due to the fact that they helped Jews. However, Israel Gutman estimated that the actual number of victims was "certainly expressed in hundreds".
In 2005, the community gathered around the foundation Institute for Strategic Studies initiated a research project entitled "Index of Poles murdered and repressed for helping Jews during World War II". The Institute of National Remembrance, as well as the Head Directorate of State Archives, the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, the Yad Vashem Institute, the German Historical Institute in Warsaw and the Jewish Historical Institute were invited to cooperate in the project. Researchers involved in the project conducted research in Polish and foreign archives (including church archives), as well as in museums, research institutions, press and Polish and foreign-language literature. As a result of these works, the Institute of National Remembrance and ISS Foundation published the "Facts of repression against Polish citizens for their help during World War II" (Warsaw 2014). It lists the names of 508 Polish citizens (both ethnic Poles and representatives of national minorities) who were repressed for helping Jews. According to the findings of the Registry it is clear that 221 of the 508 victims were executed or died in prisons and concentration camps. A further thirteen have been sentenced to death, but there is no information on the execution of the sentence. Moreover, it was not possible to establish the fate of several dozen people who were sent to concentration camps or imprisoned in detention centers and prisons.
The Register is open and the information contained therein will be verified and supplemented. Furthermore, the first edition of it describes mainly those cases of retribution, the circumstances of which were usually not described in more detail before. For this reason, the list of 508 repressed people does not include the victims of some known crimes committed against Poles who helped Jews (including the Ulma family from Markowa, the families of Kowalski, Kosiors, Obuchiewiczs and Skoczylas from Stary Ciepiełów and Rekówka, the guardians of Bunker "Krysia" in Warsaw, Henryk Sławik).
Other attempts were also made to establish the number of Poles murdered by the Germans for helping Jews. The Polish Association of Former Political Prisoners estimated the number of victims at ca. 2500. Wacław Zajączkowski in his work entitled "Martyrs of Charity" (edited by the Maximilian Kolbe Foundation, Washington 1988) mentioned the names of 2300 Poles who were to be executed for helping Jews. Anna Poray-Wybranowska in her work entitled "Those Who Risked Their Lives" (Chicago, April 2008) included surnames of over 5 thousand victims.
Examples of retribution.
The fate of the Ulma family from Markowa near Łańcut became the symbol of martyrdom of Poles murdered for helping Jews. In the second half of 1942 Józef Ulma received eight Jews from the Goldmans/Szall, Grünfeld and Didner families. A year and a half later, the Ulmas were denounced by Włodzimierz Leś, a "blue policeman" who took possession of the Szall family's property and intended to get rid of its rightful owners. On March 24, 1944, German gendarmes from Łańcut came to Markowa. They shot Józef Ulma, his wife Wiktoria (which was in an advanced pregnancy) and six children, the oldest of whom was eight years old and the youngest one and a half years old. Together with the Ulmas, all the Jews in hiding, including two women and a child, died.
In the winter of 1942 and 1943, the German Gendarmerie carried out a large-scale repressive action in the region of Ciepiełów, aimed at intimidating the Polish population and discouraging it from helping Jews. On December 6, 1942, 31 Poles were shot or burnt alive in the villages of Stary Ciepielów and Rekówka, mostly from the families of Kowalski, Kosior, Obuchiewicz and Skoczylas. There were also two Jewish escapees killed. Twenty children under the age of 18 were murdered. The youngest victim of the massacre was 7 months old, the oldest one was about 70 years old. Two days later, gendarmes murdered Marianna Skwira, who was involved with her husband in the campaign to help Jewish refugees. A distinctive culmination of the action was the murder carried out around January 11, 1943 in the village of Zajączków. The widow Stanisława Wołowiec, her four daughters aged from 6 months to 12 years, her brother-in-law Józef Jelonek and the farmstead Franciszek Zaborski were murdered there. The crimes were committed in retaliation for helping the Jewish refugees by the Wołowiec family. A series of executions against residents of the village near Ciepielów was one of the greatest crimes committed by Germans on Poles who helped Jews.
At least six repressive actions targeted at Poles helping Jews were carried out by gendarmes from neighbouring Lipsko during the same period. On December 14, 1942, Franciszek Osojca, his wife Aniela and their two-year-old son Zdzisław, were murdered in the village Okół. In December 1942 and January 1943, the Lipsko Gendarmerie carried out three repressive actions in the colony of Boiska near Solec nad Wisłą, during which they murdered 10 people from the families of Kryczek, Krawczyk and Boryczyk and two Jews hidden in the grove of Franciszek Parol (wife of the latter was imprisoned in Radom).
The large-scale repressive action against Poles supporting Jews was also carried out in the vicinity of the Paulinów village in the Sokolowski County. The immediate cause of the repressive action was the activity of a provocateur's agent, who pretending to escape from the transport to Treblinka camp, gained information about the inhabitants of the village who helped Jews. On February 24, 1943, the Paulinów village was surrounded by a strong penal expedition from Ostrów Mazowiecka. As a result of the pacification 11 local Poles were murdered. Three of the refugees who benefited from their assistance were also killed.
The repressive action against Poles supporting Jews was also carried out in Pantalowice in Przeworsk County. On December 4, 1942, a group of gendarmes and Gestapo members from Łańcut came to the village with a young Jewish girl, who was promised to save her life in exchange for naming Poles helping Jewish refugees. Six people identified by the girl were shot in the courtyard of one of the farms. In the house of Władysław Dec, who was murdered, the gendarmes found a picture of his three brothers, who were also identified by the Jewish woman as being food-suppliers. As a result, that same night the Germans went to the nearby village of Hadle Szklarskie, where they arrested and shot Stanisław, Tadeusz and Bronisław Dec.
In retaliation for supporting the Jewish escapees, the village of Przewrotne was pacified, or rather its neighborhood of Studzieniec. On December 1, 1942, a unit of the German gendarmerie arrived there, which surrounded the buildings and nearby forest. The Zeller family, hiding in Studziec, fell into the German hands. Four of its members were killed on the spot, and the temporarily spared Metla Zeller was tortured to give up her help. Despite the torture, the woman did not point anyone out. Therefore, she and six Polish men from the families of Dziubek, Drąg, Pomykała and Żak were shot.
Moreover, the following people died for helping Jews:
Some authors consider helping Jews as the reason of pacification of such villages as: Bór Kunowski (3/4 July 1943, 43 victims), Cisie (28 June 1943, 25 victims), Krobonosz (26 May 1942, 15 victims), Liszno (18 May 1942, 60 victims, Obórki (November 1942, at least several dozen victims), Parypse (22 May 1942, 8 victims), Przewrotne (14 March 1943, 36 victims), Staw (26 May 1942, 8 victims), Tarnów (May 1942, 40 victims), Widły (26 May 1942, several dozen victims), Wola Przybysławska (10 December 1942, 19 victims).
Repercussions.
Analysing the impact of the German acts of retribution on the attitude of Poles towards Jewish refugees, one should take into account the fact that decisions on the possible granting of aid were taken in a situation where significant parts of the Polish nation were exterminated, and the entire ethnic Polish population remained under threat of Nazi terror. The first months of the German governments have already made Polish society aware that even minor violations of the occupation order will be punished with absolute and cruel punishment. In addition, the Germans deliberately tried to publicise the retribution meted on people supporting Jews, thus intimidating Polish society and discouraging them from taking any support measures. Many historians believe that the fear of German retribution was one of the most important factors discouraging Poles from helping Jewish refugees (other important factors are: significant number of Jewish minority and its low assimilation rate, anti-Semitism, war poverty and demoralisation).
Some historians have come to the conclusion that the main motivation of those helping Jews was the desire for profit, Jan Tomasz Gross came to the conclusion that hiding the fugitives could not be a particularly risky occupation, because in his opinion few people would endanger their own lives and those of their loved ones only for the sake of income. Gunnar S. Paulsson compared the minimum number of Poles involved in rescuing Jews (160,000) with the number of about 700 people reported killed by GKBZpNP-IPN, and concluded that the probability of death for this reason was between 1 and 230. Taking into account the remaining threats to which Poles under German occupation were exposed, he decided that helping Jews in practice was only to some extent more risky than other offences against the occupation order. In his assessment:
Other historians have estimated however that the percentage of Poles acting solely on financial grounds was only from several to twenty percent. Marcin Urynowicz points out that German terror was very effectively intimidating wide circles of Polish society, hence the real threats faced by the person to whom assistance was requested did not have a direct connection with the level of fear she felt. In conclusion, he states:
Barbara Engelking points out that the fear of German repression grew, especially when there were cases of executions of Poles suspected of supporting Jewish refugees in a certain area. Such events often had a major impact on the situation of Jews in hiding. There are known cases where the demonstrative repressive actions carried out by the Germans, and even the threat of severe punishments themselves, have reached the goal of intimidating the local population and significantly reducing aid to Jews. In some cases, the fear of denunciation and severe penalties resulted in the expulsion of fugitives into the hands of Germans. It also happened that Poles who, for various reasons, could not or did not want to hide Jewish fugitives, preferred to murder them instead of allowing them to seek refuge elsewhere. According to one of the Jewish survivors the story of the massacre of the Ulma family made such a shocking impression on the local population that the bodies of 24 Jews were later found in the Markowa area, where Polish caregivers murdered them because of fear of denunciation. However, according to the historian Mateusz Szpytma, this crime took place in the neighbouring Sietsza village – in addition, most probably two years before the Ulmas' death.
Numbers of those who helped and survivors.
Marek Arczyński believed that "in the conditions of the Nazi occupation terror, unprecedented elsewhere, saving Jews in Poland grew to an act of special sacrifice and heroism". However, in Polish society there were people willing to take such a risk. Gunnar S. Paulsson estimated that there were 280,000 to 360,000 Poles involved in various forms of aid to Jews, of which about 70–90,000 in Warsaw alone. Teresa Prekerowa estimated the number of helpers at 160–360 thousand, Marcin Urynowicz at 300 thousand, and Władysław Bartoszewski at "at least several hundred thousand". According to Jan Żaryn, the number of Poles participating directly or indirectly in the rescue of Jews could reach even one million, and according to Richard Lukas – at least from 800,000 to 1.2 million. 
It is difficult to determine the number of Jews who survived the German occupation, hiding among Poles. Shmuel Krakowski claimed that not more than 20 thousand people survived on the Aryan side. Israel Gutman estimated that about 50 thousand Jews survived in the occupied territory of Poland, of which between 30 thousand and 35 thousand survived thanks to the help of Poles. According to estimates by Teresa Prekerowa, between 30 thousand and 60 thousand Jews survived by hiding among the Polish population ("with or without their help"). Grzegorz Berendt estimated that in occupied Poland about 50 thousand Jews "on the Aryan side" survived. Gunnar S. Paulsson, on the other hand, estimated that about 100 thousand Jews were hiding in occupied Poland, of which nearly 46 thousand managed to survive the war. According to him, 28 thousand Jews were hiding in Warsaw alone, of which nearly 11.5 thousand were saved.
Comparison with the situation in other occupied countries in Europe.
Marek Arczyński pointed out that "in no occupied country did the Nazis use such far-reaching repressive and cruel terror for the help of the Jewish population as in Poland". Other historians also formulated similar opinions. Contrary to the widespread stereotype, Poland was not, however, the only occupied country in Europe, where any aid to Jews was threatened by the death penalty. The principle of collective responsibility for helping Jews in hiding was introduced by the Germans in the occupied territories of the USSR and in the occupied Balkan states, i. e. in countries where under the pretext of fighting against partisans they abandoned the observance of the rules of humanitarian law.
On the other hand, much less risk was associated with helping Jews in the occupied countries of Western Europe or in states allied with the Third Reich. The granting of aid to Jews was usually punished there by confiscation of property, imprisonment or deportation to a concentration camp. For example, two Dutchmen were arrested for helping Anna Frank's family, none of whom were executed. Stefan Korboński claimed that in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, there was not a single case of death sentence imposed on a person helping Jewish fellow citizens. Only in Denmark there was an incident when a man was shot dead when he was helping Jews to get on a ferry to neutral Sweden. However, the Yad Vashem Institute points out that there are known cases of deaths of Western European citizens in concentration camps, to which they were deported due to aiding Jews. Nevertheless, the difference between the reality of occupied Poland and the situation in Western European countries may be measured by the fact that in Holland it was possible to organise public protests against deportations of the Jewish population.
Calculations by Teresa Prekerowa show that only 1% to 2.5% of the adult Polish population was involved in helping Jews. In Western Europe the number of helpers was similarly small, though the risk associated with these activities was incomparably lower.
Assuming the percentage of the population of European countries, which in 1945 was made up of Jews who survived the Holocaust, Poland did not differ from the average in other occupied states. On the other hand, in the Netherlands, where few Jews lived and anti-Semitic sentiments were much weaker than in Poland, the losses of the Jewish population were, in percentage terms, comparable with the losses of Polish Jews. Gunnar S. Paulsson estimated that among the Jews that attempted to hide on the Aryan side in Warsaw and Holland, the percentage of survivors was almost identical. Moreover, his calculations show that the "loss ratio" of Warsaw Jews and Danish Jews was almost identical. Paulsson stated, however, that for various reasons Jews who attempted to hide in the rural areas of occupied Poland had much less chance of survival.
Commemoration.
By 1 January 2016, the number of Poles honored with the medal "Righteous Among the Nations" was 6620. The Honoured are, in most cases, people who are not connected with the broadly understood resistance movement and who provided help to Jews on their own account. Among the honored were a number of Poles who died as a result of helping Jews, including five members of the Baranek family, Michał and Katarzyna Gerula, Sebastian and Katarzyna Kazak, Henryk, Janina, Maria and Leon Olszewski, prof. Franciszek Paweł Raszeja, Maria Rogozińska, Jadwiga Sałek-Deneko, Fr Adam Sztark, Józef and Wiktoria Ulma, Mieczysław Wolski and Janusz Wysocki.
Monuments commemorating Poles who saved Jews during World War II were erected in Kielce (1996) and Łódź (2009). On March 24, 2004 in Markowa, a monument commemorating the Ulma family was unveiled. In addition, on March 17, 2016, the Museum of Poles Saving Jews during the Second World War named after Ulma family in Markowa was opened.
In 2008, the Institute of National Remembrance and the National Cultural Centre initiated an educational campaign "Life for life" aimed at showing the attitudes of Poles who risked their lives to save Jews during the Second World War.
In March 2012, the National Bank of Poland introduced coins commemorating three Polish families murdered for helping Jews – the Kowalski family from Stary Ciepiełów, the Ulma family from Markowa and the Baranek family from Siedliska.
The stories of Poles murdered by the Germans for providing help to Jews were presented in documentaries entitled "Price of Life" from 2004 (dir. Andrzej Baczyński), "Righteous Among the Nations" from 2004 (dir. Dariusz Walusiak), "Life for Life" in 2007 (dir. Arkadiusz Gołębiewski)[273], "Historia Kowalskich" 2009 (dir. Arkadiusz Gołębiewski, Maciej Pawlicki).

Cyclopentyne

Cyclopentyne is a cycloalkyne containing five carbon atoms in the ring. Due to the ideal bond angle of 180° at each atom of the alkyne but the structural requirement that the bonds form a ring, this chemical is a highly strained structure, and the triple bond is highly reactive. The triple bond easily undergoes both [2+2] and [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. Unlike benzyne, which undergoes a [2+2] addition with loss of stereochemistry at the alkene partner, cyclopentyne reacts with alkenes with retention of geometry of the partner, an example of the relevance of orbital symmetry even for highly reactive structures. The structure can also form a π complex with lithium cations, which affects the cycloaddition reactivity. It can even interact strongly enough with copper species to form a novel type of metallacycle.

Siege of Smolensk (1502)

The Siege of Smolensk was an unsuccessful attempt to capture Smolensk by the forces of the Grand Duchy of Moscow in summer 1502. It was the last major military engagement during the Muscovite–Lithuanian War (1500–1503). 
Smolensk, a strong and strategically important fortress, was a part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania since 1404. Ivan III of Russia launched the second Muscovite–Lithuanian War in 1500 and Lithuanians suffered a great defeat in the Battle of Vedrosha. Stanisław Kiszka became regent of Smolensk in 1499 and ordered improvements to Smolensk Kremlin. By the time the Russian army, commanded by Ivan's son , reached Smolensk in June 1502, Smolensk was well-prepared for the siege.
The Russian army plundered Orsha and Vitebsk and attacked Smolensk with artillery. Their assault on 16 September was not only repelled but the defense grew into a counterattack. The indecisive but bloody Battle of Lake Smolino in September as well as Lithuanian reinforcements brought by Great Hetman (commander of the army) Stanislovas Kęsgaila, forced the Russians to retreat.
Peace negotiations began while the army was still at Smolensk. A six-year truce was concluded on the Feast of the Annunciation (March 25) in 1503. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania lost approximately , or a third of its territory: Chernihiv, Novhorod-Siverskyi, Starodub, and lands around the upper Oka River. In recognition of his defense of Smolensk, Kiszka was promoted to Great Hetman in 1503. Ivan III succeeded in capturing Smolensk in 1514.

Judith Lodge

Judith Lodge (born July 25, 1941) is an American Canadian painter and photographer who often explores how the two mediums play off of and inform one another. Her abstract portraits of memories, situations, events, and people are inspired by the unconscious, dreams, journals, and nature. She has worked in Vancouver, Victoria, Toronto, Banff, Minnesota, and New York, where she has lived for more than thirty years.
Background.
Lodge was one of four daughters born to Jean Lodge in St. Paul, Minnesota. Her father, James, was a chemist at 3M who enjoyed throwing pots in his free time and built a tiny studio in the basement of their home. From as early as the fourth grade, she would bring a large pad of paper to class and tell people, "You make a mark, I’ll make a drawing from it." She completed a Bachelor of Science at Macalester College in St. Paul (1963). She received a Master of Fine Arts from Cranbrook Academy of Fine Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan (1965), where she was the only woman in a class of 12. In the summer following her MFA graduation, Lodge made numerous trips to New York City, where she attended large Alberto Giacometti and Francis Bacon retrospectives. These exhibitions were greatly influential on Lodge as they exposed her to approaches in art practice which were not being taken up by the Cranbrook school at that time.
Artistic career.
In 1972, Lodge moved to Vancouver, where she would spend the next decade, and began to work less figuratively than in earlier years. In Vancouver, she was friends with many women who were active in the women’s movement. She had her first entirely non-figurative solo exhibition in 1977 at the Surrey Art Gallery. At some point, Lodge expected to return to figurative work but became preoccupied by the technical and aesthetic possibilities of the abstract format. Her inspiration from nature is greatly credited to time spent on an island off the coast of Vancouver, which was partly owned by a friend. Here, she explored landscapes and notions of water. Although Lodge returned to the United States in 1980, moving to New York after finding Vancouver a discouraging place for artists, she continually aims to recreate the feeling of nature in British Columbia. Lodge notes how dreams and unconsciousness bring things to one’s attention, and claims she began making painted mandalas out of nowhere before finding out she had cancer. Following her diagnosis, chemotherapy, and surgery, Lodge became attracted to photographing trees which had been struck by fire yet were still alive, stating that she felt akin to them.

Lodge’s monumental abstract works, sometimes as large as 10’x16’, partially derive from 1950s abstract expressionism. She typically utilizes a painterly style where thick layers and ropes of acrylic paint are built up in an almost three-dimensional topography, reminiscent of veins or sinews upon the surface of skin. The texture is built up in three or four steps and certain areas may be reworked in the process. Lodge often uses metallic gold, significantly in works from the "Life Jackets" and "Walls of Eden" exhibitions, symbolic of incorruptibility and sacredness, and confronting its audience rather than receding. She also tends to employ a strong sense of grid organization, as seen in the enormous works from "Walls of Eden."
Themes.
"As a kid in a museum it looks like there is everything to talk about and paint, but it turns out that there are really only a few things. The seductive part about being a painter, I find, is that life is not a candy jar but rather there are a few central issues toward which one directs one’s life. I can remember being in high school when I first saw a reproduction of the Gauguin, […] "Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going"… well, there it was—profound philosophic content painted and then restated in words right on the canvas in the most direct and flatfooted war. I was astounded. Certainly, the notion that there are major primal subjects to be dealt with in the subconscious, in myth, in dreams, etc. is part of my painting heritage" - Judith Lodge Lodge’s paintings demonstrate how the boundary between conscious and unconscious can be a permeable membrane. Along with the world of nature and recalling images from life and the unconscious, other topics Lodge addresses in her work include, concerns with intersecting and overlapping areas of change; the eternal and the intangible; documentation of life energies, of what is seen, felt, and remembered; the notion of beauty as not fixed; and beauty tinged with terror and decomposition.

Ben Moore (born 3 January 1986) is a British snowboarder. He is competing at the 2018 Winter Paralympics in snowboarding events for athletes with upper limb disabilities having lost the use of his left arm after a motorbike accident in 2006.
Moore was a keen skateboarder before he had his accident. He qualified and started work as a snowboard instructor in Canada after being inspired to take up the sport during a holiday in Bulgaria. Moore missed the bus to work one day and, rather than waiting for the next one, decided to hitchhike instead. This led to a chance encounter with competitive snowboarders who gave him the idea of competing himself. Moore began competing and achieved success when he won bronze in the banked slalom SB-UL 2017 Para Snowboard World Championships in Big White Ski Resort, Canada. He is set to represent Great Britain at the 2018 Winter Paralympics, competing in Banked Slalom and SBX events alongside Owen Pick and James Barnes-Miller. Snowboarding was first added to the Paralympics in Sochi 2014, with 2018 being the first time that Great Britain has been represented and the first time that upper limb category has been added to the events.

Royal Air Force daylight raids, 1940–1944

The Royal Air Force strategic bombing campaign against Germany was waged by Bomber Command for five years. The vast majority of these sorties were flown at night. After suffering heavy losses attempting daylight bombing raids over the Heligoland islands in the North Sea and over France during the first half of 1940, Bomber Command had largely withdrawn its aircraft from daylight attacks. Bomber Command, however, was still willing to risk aircraft to attack targets in daylight on occasion. These were usually targets that required highly precise delivery of bombs, such as warships or small factories. Industries located in occupied territories were another group of targets that required a high degree of accuracy when attacked to avoid casualties among the civilians of the occupied country.
In addition, after winning the Battle of Britain, Fighter Command went over onto the offensive. Fighter Command conducted provocative missions in what they termed the "Circus" operations. These missions were various fighter sweeps over northern France and Belgium conducted to engage the Luftwaffe. The Ramrod type raid was a Circus offensive operation where a small number of bombers were escorted to a target with a very large fighter escort. Bomber Command supported the effort by assigning No. 2 Group to work with Fighter Command. No. 2 Group squadrons were equipped with faster, more manoeuvrable medium bombers, and as a group it was set apart for conducting daylight raids against near targets. Except for occasional diversionary efforts, No. 2 Group did not participate in the Bomber Offensive over Germany.
Missions.
After the Allied invasion of the continent Allied control of the airspace over Europe was widespread, and daylight raids became much more common for Bomber Command crews. These later missions are not included in the above list.

ADS 1359

ADS 1359 is a quadruple star system in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is composed of two sun like stars in an eclipsing binary with a 2.5-day period, which is in turn orbited by an A-type main-sequence star with a 185-year orbital period. There is also HD 236848 which is a distant proper motion companion.
Visual binary.
The visual binary was discovered by Sherburne Wesley Burnham at Dearborn Observatory in Chicago in 1880. A first preliminary orbit was calculated in 1971 by astronomer Georgije Popović using observations from 1880 to 1967. Improved orbits were calculated in 1995, 2009 and 2017. The two stars were separated by when they were discovered, but only in 2010. The orbit has a high eccentricity and the separation of the two stars varies between about and .
Eclipsing binary.
ADS 1359 was discovered by the Hipparcos spacecraft to be a detached eclipsing binary and given the variable star designation V773 Cassiopeiae. The derived period of variability was 1.29 days, exactly half the orbital period of the inner pair since each orbit produces two almost-identical eclipses. The eclipsing stars are the inner pair of the system. The two stars combined are still about eight times fainter than the third star and so the eclipses decrease the overall brightness of V773 Cas by less than 0.1 magnitudes.
HD 236848.
The Washington Double Star Catalog lists a 16th magnitude companion as component C and a 10th magnitude companion as component D. Component D is HD 236848 and it shares the same space motion and distance as the inner three stars.

1927 UK &amp; Ireland Greyhound Racing Year

The 1927 UK &amp; Ireland Greyhound Racing Year was the second year of greyhound racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
Summary.
Greyhound Racing Association.
The GRA acquired the near-derelict White City Stadium, (originally The Great Stadium), that had been built in 1908 for the Summer Olympics. The White City track was grassed over and Major Percy Brown was installed as Racing Manager. On 20 June, a greyhound called Charlie Cranston won the first ever race there and with club house accommodation for over 1,000 people, and a 500-yard track circumference with wide sweeping turns and fast times the venue was an immediate hit with the public. Early visitors included Edward VIII and Prince George, later King George VI. The GRA also moved its headquarters to White City Stadium from Belle Vue Stadium at the same time.
Harringay Stadium was the third greyhound racing stadium to be bought by the GRA. It was constructed by Messers T.G. Simpson of Victoria Street, London, at a cost of £35,000. The 23-acre site was formerly the Williamson's Pottery Works from the late 18th century through to the early 1900s. On completion the stadium had a capacity of 50,000. When it opened on the 13 September it was originally called Harringay Park. 
The GRA's finances were helped with the use of a sophisticated automatic totalisator betting system. By the end of the year GRA had ownership or shares in no less than 19 tracks that were already operating or due to open in the near future. Two of the planned tracks failed to go ahead. Despite the trustees allowing the Crystal Palace site to be used for greyhound racing it never got off the ground. A Protestant church petition of 43,434 signatures helped the National Anti-Gambling League prosecute the trustees and the racing proposals failed. In addition the £60,000 proposal for the Isle of Man race track, at Onchan Head Bay, with a bathing pool and changing facilities failed. A bill was put before Tynwald (Isle of Man parliament) to prohibit betting and gaming except on the existing horse racing activities and it was passed. The 17 tracks remaining was a remarkable achievement due to the fact that GRA had only come into existence as a company the previous year. Other companies began to rival the GRA and there were well publicised disputes between the GRA and these companies. A National board of control of canine and greyhound racing held a meeting in Manchester to form a control board for greyhound racing (a short lived organisation for tracks outside of the GRA). 
Ireland and Scotland.
Ireland had been a hot bed of coursing for many years and was also subjected to the new version of track racing. A greyhound called Mick the Miller had been born in June 1926 and the brindle dog was named after Michael Greene, who was the odd-job man at the vicarage and Millbrook house where the dog was born and raised. One of his duties was looking after the dog and the other eleven in the litter when they were puppies. Bred by a parish priest called Father Martin Brophy, Mick the Miller was sent coursing and was actually beaten in his first course against a greyhound called Hidden Jew.
A quartet of Irish enthusiasts Hugh McAlinden, Joe Shaw, Jim Clarke and Paddy O'Donoghue introduced track racing to Ireland at Celtic Park in Belfast when the first Irish track was built and opened on 18 April. This was followed by Shelbourne Park in Dublin one month later on the 14 May. Shelbourne employed four track trainers in their kennels, Mick Horan, Paddy Quigley, Billy Donoghue and Ben Scally. Scotland opened Powderhall Stadium (North Edinburgh) located in Beaverhall Road on 3 August. This was a track with easy bends and long straights and over 10,000 attended the first meeting. 
Competitions.
The GRA introduced the first major races to be held on an annual basis, including 1927 English Greyhound Derby held at White City. They also created the Champion Hurdle (later to be named the Grand National) for hurdlers and the Oaks for bitches (both at White City), these races were named after the big horse races. Belle Vue introduced the Northern Flat as their first major event. The meetings at the tracks would be managed by the Racing Manager and stewards who would normally be selected from prominent military backgrounds. In addition the GRA purchased the Hook estate at Northaw, 13 miles from the centre of London. It was the base for GRA trainers to train greyhounds for White City and Harringay and later other London tracks. The 140 acres of park and grassland would become famous within the industry. The estate at this time was solely for racing hounds and puppies over nine months old and could house 600 dogs. The pups under nine months were reared under the supervision of William Skerratt on farms in and around Blythe Bridge near Stoke-on-Trent before graduating to Northaw. 
Wembley.
Wembley Greyhounds opened on the 10 December and although the venue will forever be known for football, the irony is that it was greyhound racing that had kept the stadium afloat in its early days. The stadium on the verge of bankruptcy and closure was bought by Arthur Elvin who brought in greyhound racing which saved the stadium from being demolished. Elvin had secured Wembley Stadium by putting a 10% deposit down for a total of £122,500. He had originally won the contract to demolish the site for owner James White who died shortly after leaving the stadium in the hands of the receivers; Elvin set up a new company and he became the Managing Director. The Director of Racing was Captain Arthur Brice, a well known judge at the Waterloo Cup. On the 30 December the National Greyhound Racing Society (NGRS) was formed to represent the commercial interests of the racecourse promoters. 
News.
Bookmaker Joe Coral took a pitch at Harringay and then White City; the Coral Empire was born and would go via Clapton and Walthamstow greyhounds before branching into betting offices. 
In the Oaks heats were held at various tracks within the GRA with the winner representing the track in the Grand Final at White City. The home representative Peach Blossom II started as hot favourite after taking the White City qualifying final two days previous in a smart 29.58. However it was the Harringay hound Three of Spades that took the honours defeating the Scottish challenger by two lengths. 
Although Bonzo is listed as winner of the first Grand National in 1927, the title of the event he won was the Champion Hurdle Race, the culmination of a competition organised by the GRA on the same lines as the inaugural Derby. A North vs. South affair, restricted to greyhounds racing on tracks owned by the company. Northern zone dogs, from Belle Vue, Liverpool and Powderhall, took part in a qualifying competition called the Westmorland Cup, while their Southern counterparts at Hall Green, Harringay and White City were sorted out in the Chesham Hurdle. Jumps races on GRA tracks were then confined to four runners, so only the first two qualified for the final. 
Roll of honour.
Principal UK races.
Note
Distances were recorded as 0.06 sec for one length (until 1950) and in Ireland 0.07 sec for one length (until 1990).

Organization of Angolan Women

The Organization of Angolan Women (Portuguese: Organização Mulher Angolana (OMA)) is a political organisation in Angola, which was founded in 1962 to target women to support the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola.
History.
The Organization of Angolan Women was established in 1962 and was originally founded to rally support for the new political party known as the MPLA. Once Angola was officially independent of Portugal in 1975 following the Angolan War of Independence, the Organization of Angolan Women provided the best opportunity for female activism in local government. Total involvement faltered in the 1980s. In 1985 membership reached 1.8 million, but by 1987 membership dropped to less than 1.3 million. Rural violence and regional destabilization disheartened many of the rural members. However, it was also during the 1980s that Angola passed the first anti-discrimination laws and established strict literacy laws to support uneducated women.
Ruth Neto, the sister of the former president of Angola, was elected to be secretary general of the OMA and the head of its fifty-three-member national committee in 1983. She was re-elected on March 2, 1988. The OMA expanded education for women, created programs to increase literacy among women, and during the 1980s the Angolan government created laws against gender discrimination in wages and working conditions.
In 1999, Luzia Inglês Van-Dúnem was elected Secretary-General of the Organização Mulher Angolana (OMA), which is the women's branch of political party, the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola(MPLA), and was re-elected in 2005.

Dasht (TV series)

Dasht (, Dashh-th) (English: Desert) is a Pakistani drama television series. It is a Balochi tribal love story directed by Abid Ali and F H Qureshi written by Munnu Bhai. Noman Ijaz and Atiqa Odho acted in lead alongside supporting actors such as Ayub Khoso, Abid Ali, Noor Muhammad Lashari, Fazila Qazi, Asad Malik &amp; Sabiha Khanum.
Dasht aired on 5 February 1993 on Pakistans first private channel NTM and won critical acclaim and was a major commercial success catapulting Atiqa Odho and Nauman Ejaz onsreen pair to stardom. Audiences appreciated the screen chemistry between Atiqa Odho and Nauman Ejaz the duo later worked together in several successful dramas including Nijaat (1993), Talaash (Telefilm 1994), Arzoo Jeenay Ki Tu Nahin (2014), Khan (2017) and are often referred to as Pakistan television's most loved on-screen couple.The drama also launched the successful debut carrier of Asad Malik.
Music composed by Wajid Ali Nashad lyrics written by poet, critic, playwright Atta Shad. The soundtracks of the drama were equally successful and popular. The cinematography of this drama is also unique first time in Pakistani television history a series of songs were used which is well received by audiences (which is rather rare in a Pakistani drama). Atiqa Odho's balochi attire and jewellery and Nauman Ejaz Balochi dressing style turban chaddar &amp; Bughti Shalwar became a trend. Shugal Pakistan ranks the drama amongst the "11 Unforgettable Classic Dramas of Pakistan".
Plot.
The story is set among three warring tribes in rural Balochistan (in Pakistan). Born into this tribal warfare are Shahtaaj Atiqa Odho and Balaaj Noman Ejaz. Despite being surrounded by violence all their lives, both are gentle souls with a love of music and poetry. While both are from opposing tribes - they ultimately fall in love! Fearing that their union could unite two tribes, the head of the third tries everything to stop this from happening. The Drama was a tale of unrequited love and parental opposition while the culture, thinking and issues of tribes in Balochistan served as sidelines of Shahtaaj (Atiqa Odho) and Balaaj (Nauman Ejaz) story of two youngsters from rival tribes who fall in love.. The plot was a modern-day take on classic tragic romance stories such as Layla and Majnun, Heer Ranjha and Romeo and Juliet.
Critical reception.
In 1993, Atiqa Odho &amp; Nauman Ejaz onsreen pair "shot into stardom" following the release of Dasht. According to critics "The drama which proudly displayed Baloch traditions, was memorable in terms of its dialogues, plot twists, superb acting, cinematography and music. Dasht was Abid Ali's first self-produced and self-directed drama serial which became a hit project of its time and this happened to be the first ever private production in Pakistan.

Ras Mala

Râs Mâlâ: Hindoo Annals of the Province of Goozerat, in Western India is a 1856 historical work by British colonial administrator Alexander Kinloch Forbes. Divided in two volumes, the work has four sections documenting the history and chronicles from 8th century Gujarat (now in India) to arrival of British and folk literature of Gujarat as well as an historical account of the place and people he came to know during his stay in Gujarat. It was later translated into Gujarati in 1869.
Origin.
Alexander Kinloch Forbes (1821–1865), a British colonial administrator, appointed in 1842 came to Ahmedabad as an assistant judge in 1846 where he began to learn Gujarati language first from Bhogilal Pranavallabh, and then from Dalpatram, a Gujarati poet. Forbes also had a deep interest in archaeology, ancient monuments and manuscripts, which made him intensely interested in the old archaeological and historical remains of Gujarat.
Forbes, along with his colleagues, established Gujarat Vernacular Society in 1848. Dalpatram was associated with Forbes since the establishment of Gujarat Vernacular Society and they became close friends. Dalpatram became instrumental, assistant guide and interpreter for Forbes in his attempt to draw the history of the province. Forbes furnished Dalpatram with necessary assistance to travel extensively and collect the chronicles and inscription from different parts of the province. Dalpatram had profound knowledge of Braj Bhasha and Charani dialect, which were popular languages in poetry gatherings at that time. Thus, Dalpatram helped Forbes to map the province and to give an outline of native world view, life style of local people.
Forbes arranged a "Kavi Melo" (a gathering of poets) at the court of Maharaja Yuvansinha of Idar State in the month of Dussera festival in 1852, and invited Charans poets and other local bards. He inquired of these poets about the history, life practices of the people, language, different rulers, great people of the past, traditions of their region, and recorded it for "Ras Mala". He also visited many Jain libraries in search of bards who told the stories of history of Gujarat.
Publication history.
In 1854, Forbes left for England, and returned to India in 1856 and published "Ras Mala".
In the subtitle of the work Forbes uses the word annals, in a fashion that is used by James Tod in his "Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan" (1829 and 1832). A brief memoir on Forbes, prepared by A. K. Nairne, appeared in the 1878 edition of "Ras Mala". "Ras Mala" was translated by Ranchhodbhai Udayaram Dave into Gujarati, and was published by Forbes Gujarati Sabha in 1869 as "Gujaratna Ketlak Aitihasik Prasango Ane Vartao".
Content.
The "Ras Mala" has two volumes; each volume is divided into two books. The text contains illustrations, principally architectural, prepared by Forbes himself.
The "Ras Mala" starts with a description of natural boundaries of Gujarat as viewed by Forbes. The first book gives an account of the rise and fall of the Chavada and Vaghela dynasties. It covers the period from about the eighth to thirteenth century. The second book gives an account of the conquest of Muslims over Anhilwad, a capital of Chavda and Vaghela kings, and the political conflicts between Muslims and Hindu rulers. The third book describes the rise of Maratha power in the province and its fall with the arrival of the British. The fourth book, entitled "Conclusions", gives an outline of the life practices of the people of the province: it describes the Hindu castes, Hindu beliefs, religious services and festivals, land tenures under Muslim rulers, Marathas and the British rule, marriage institution, funeral rites, etc.
Reception and criticism.
In the introduction of the 1878 edition, J. W. Watson serving at the Rajkot as the British Resident, noted, "There are few other books of reference about Goozerat [Gujarat], and none of them so encyclopaedic in character." H. G. Rawlinson, an historian who introduced a new edition of "Ras Mala" in 1924, called the book "a work for all time". "Ras Mala" is often compared with James Tod's "Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan" and James Grant Duff's "A History of the Mahrattas".

Ban Khamin

Ban Khamin (, ; lit: "Village of Turmeric") is a road junction and historic neighborhood in the Siri Rat Subdistrict, Bangkok Noi District in Thon Buri side, Bangkok. It's the three-way of Arun Ammarin Road and Soi Itsaraphap 44 (Saeng Sueksa).
History &amp; characteristics.
The name "Ban Khamin" after this area in the Thon Buri period (1767–82) before the rise of Rattanakosin Kingdom (1782–present). It's a community of professionals who make turmeric powder ("ban" in Thai means "house, village" and "khamin" means "turmeric"). It's an important ingredient in traditional Thai medicine. Currently, the turmeric powder industry has been lost. There's only one shop in the Phran Nok Intersection which nearby, but named "Ban Khamin" is still in use today. Apart from the junction, there're also Khlong Ban Khamin (คลองบ้านขมิ้น; Ban Khamin Canal), a small waterway with a length of only 1.5 km (about 0.9 mi) near Siriraj Hospital and San Chaopho Ban Khamin Pung Thao Kong (ศาลเจ้าพ่อบ้านขมิ้น (ปึงท้าวกง)), a small Teochew joss house built on the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing dynasty, located near the junction.
In the past, after World War II ended shortly, there was a cinema named Ban Khamin Theater located in the local market area. Even if it's only a second class cinema. But it's very popular with locals, because at that time Thonburi side is still rural. It came to an end when it was totally burned down on the late in the morning of Sunday August 16th, 1970. The entire wooden building burned down. One of the dead was a 4-year-old boy who fled to hide in a jar. At present, the location of the cinema and market becomes a vet clinic and parking lot.
From Ban Khamin in Soi Itsaraphap 44, there's also a roadway (turn right) toward Ban Chang Lo (บ้านช่างหล่อ) in the area of Ban Chang Lo Subdistrict. It's one of the oldest communities in Thonburi, people in the community have a career casting the Buddha statue. And another roadway (turn left) to the Soi Matum (ซอยมะตูม; Matum Alley) or Trok Matum (ตรอกมะตูม; Matum Lane) in the Soi Arun Ammarin 23. People in this area have a business produced and selling sweet bael preserves ("matum" in Thai means "bael"). Originally named here "Ban Plueak Som O" (บ้านเปลือกส้มโอ; "House of Pomelo Peel") was later changed "Soi Suan Anan" (ซอยสวนอนันต์) and Soi Matum as the current.

Société Boigues &amp; Cie

The Société Boigues &amp; Cie (originally Boigues et fils) was a French ironmaking company based in Fourchambault, Nièvre, founded by a Parisian metal trader. 
Boigues et fils built a foundry at Fourchambault, Nièvre in 1821–22, the first in France to use the modern English technique of making iron using coal (coke) rather than charcoal. 
The company became a limited partnership, Société Boigues &amp; Cie, in 1839 after the death of the co-founder Jean Louis Boigues. 
In 1853 it merged with other companies to form what would be later named the Société de Commentry, Fourchambault et Decazeville
Origins.
Pierre Bouygues (1755–1820) had a business in Paris during the Directory and Empire that bought and sold old iron, lead, copper, pewter, bell metal and whole bells.
He married Catherine Brousse (1764–1848).
Their surviving children were Louis Boigues (1784–1838), Gabrielle Boigues (1788–1855) who married Claude Hochet and was mother of Prosper Hochet, Raymond Bouyges (born 1791), Bertrand (Meillard) Boiges (1794–1845), Guillaume Émile Boigues (1805–85) and Marie Boigues (c. 1808–1864) who married Count Hippolyte François Jaubert.
At the start of the 19th century Bouygues was a trader in iron and copper in Paris, and around 1804 bought a property in Nivernais.
In 1817 the Maison Paillot Père et Fils and a M. Labbé asked Jean-Georges Dufaud Père, the director of their Grossouvre, Cher, foundry, to visit England to purchase iron.
Dufaud was the son of an "Ancien Régime" ironmaster.
Dufaud bought 15,000-20,000 tons of iron.
While in Wales he discovered the technical specifications of an English-style forge he wanted to install in France.
The forge at Trézy near Grossouvre was operational in 1817 using the new coal-based technology and its first products were sold at the start of 1818.
In 1819 the leases on the Grossouvre site and its facilities were assigned to Boigues et Fils, Paris iron merchants, and Labbé.
They decided to find a new site on the Loire to which it would be easier to transport coal, and decided on Fourchambault in Nièvre.
Boigues et fils.
Boigues's son Jean Louis Boigues (1780–1838) arranged for Dufaud to install a large English-style forge at Fourchambault.
Their plan was to combine the new approach to refining iron using coal with the more conventional approach using charcoal practiced in Berry.
A dock was built for cargo boats, and the Loire provided water for the steam engines.
The forge at Trézy was transferred to Fourchambault on the Loire below Nevers and installed in extensive new facilities in 1821–22.
The Charbonnières Raveaux and Cramain furnaces became annexes to the new building, and Boigues &amp; Fils found several furnaces from the Nivernais and Berry to feed pig iron to the cast iron forge.
The move brought the forge closer to supplies of raw materials.
Manufacturing began in 1822.
Almost 3,000 workers from the surrounding countryside were employed in the cast iron foundry.
The ironworks used the coke-blast smelting process.
It produced large quantities of high quality iron.
The plant at Fourchambault employed workers from England and Wales, and soon reached annual output of 5,000 to 6,000 tons with 4,000 workers.
In 1824 Georges Dufaud passed direction of the forge to his son Achille.
His son-in-law Émile Martin also played an important technical role in the enterprise.
By 1824 the Boiges's had eliminated Paillot and Labbé and made an agreement that divided ownership 1/8 to the Maison de Paris, which handed the accounts of all the factories of Boigues et fils in Fouchambault, with the remaining 7/8 divided 3/4 to Louis Boigues in Paris and 1/4 to Meillard-Bouges, his brother, who worked as an administrator in Fourchambault.
Dufaud continued to manage the forge.
Louis Bourges was also a founder of a factory at Imphy, Nièvre, and was one of the main owners of a factory at Janon, Loire.
Over the ensuing years Boiges, Dufaud and their partners developed Fourchambault into a major center of metallurgy.
At the 1827 Exposition des produits de l'industrie française in Paris Boigues et fils were given an honorable mention for their cast iron.
It was noted that they were the first to use coal, a plentiful mineral, while there were limited resources of wood.
In the category of metallurgical arts they won a gold medal.
They bought ten blast furnaces in the region around Fourchambault and existing ironworks that included a sheet metal plant at Imphy and a nail factory at Cosne.
Émile Martin, Dufaud's son-in-law, built a foundry near the Fourchambault forge.
In the 1820s the Boigues and other partners in Fourchambault such as Dufaud and Martin were heavily involved in promoting railways.
In 1836 the brothers Adolphe and Eugène Schneider acquired the iron works at Le Creusot with investments by François Alexandre Seillière and Louis Boigues.
Adolphe had married Valerie Aignan, stepdaughter of Louis Boigues.
In 1838 Boigues et fils engaged with the Société Rambourg Frères, owner of a coal mine in Commentry, Allier.
An 1839 description of the works at Fourchambault said the raw iron to be refined was supplied by 18 blast furnaces, five of which were operated by the Boigues company in Nièvre and five in Cher.
One of the furnaces used coke for fuel in the English way.
Three of the blast furnaces had bellows driven by steam engines, and at Charbonnière a steam engine was used as back-up when the water supply failed.
16 furnaces at Fourchambault were used for refining the iron, and six others were used to heat the refined iron to be stretched into bars for sale.
All the iron work was done by rolling mills according to the dimensions of the iron bars required.
Two steam engines, each of 60 horsepower, provided power to the various rolling mills.
The factory at Fourchambault employed about 3,000 workers including those involved in harvesting wood for fuel.
A suspension bridge was being built across the Loire to connect Fourchambault in Nièvre to Givry in Cher, due to be completed in 1835.
Société Boigues &amp; Cie.
Jean Louis Boigues died on 14 November 1838 in Fourchambault, Nièvre.
After his death the Fourchambault enterprise was reorganized as a "societé en commandite", a limited partnership controlled by the heirs of Boigues and Dufaud.
The Société Boigues &amp; Cie soon began a major expansion to meet growing demand from railways.
Claude Hochet was the brother-in-law of Jean Louis Boigues.
His son Jules Hochet became manager of the iron foundry of the Société Boigues &amp; Cie.
In 1846 Hochet, iron master at Fourchambault, became a member of the Association pour la défense du Travail national.
This had been formed to oppose the lowering of tariffs.
In the crisis year of 1848 Charles de Wendel and Eugène Schneider saved the foundry at Fourchambault from bankruptcy by co-signing a huge bank loan.
The law of 1 December 1851 authorized formation of the Chemin de fer de Lyon à Avignon, owned by Genissieu, Boigues &amp; Cie, Emile Martin &amp; Cie, Edouard Blount, Parent (Bazile), and Drouillard Benoist &amp; Cie.
The Société Boigues, Rambourg &amp; Cie was created in 1852 and reorganized on 1 January 1854.
The "gerants" were P. Benoist d'Azy, Em. Boiges, J. Hochet, Mouy and P. Rambourg.
On 17 December 1853 the Société Boigues &amp; Cie and the Société Rambourg Frères, which owned the Commentry mine, merged with other enterprises to form the Société Boigues, Rambourg &amp; Cie.
The company, later renamed the Société de Commentry, Fourchambault et Decazeville was formed in 1853 through a merger of the Fourchambault foundry, Imphy (Nièvre) steelworks, Montluçon (Allier) foundry and Commentry (Allier) colliery.
The new company was dominated by the Boigues family for the steel plants at Fourchambault, Toteron and La Guerche and the Rambourg family for the Commentry mine.
The owners of Montluçon, Imphy and La Pique were in the minority.

2019 European Parliament election in Romania

The European Parliament election of 2019 was held in Romania on 26 May 2019.
Background.
Social Democratic Party.
In April 2019, the Party of European Socialists (PES) announced on Wednesday that it would freeze relations with the Social Democrats (PSD) at least until June, citing concerns about the rule of law in the country. Since then the (PSD) moved further to Euroscepticism. Victor Ponta, who was expelled from the PSD in 2017, said "The PSD unfortunately has turned to a very populist, very nationalistic, demagogic party," he said.
National Liberal Party.
Three days after the 2014 election, on 28 May 2014, National Liberal Party president Crin Antonescu announced that the party would change European affiliation from ALDE to EPP, and it has started negotiations for the merger with the Democratic Liberal Party. The newly created party would still be called National Liberal Party, and be a member of the EPP. Democratic Liberal Party president Vasile Blaga later that day confirmed the merger of the two parties. MEP Norica Nicolai, first candidate on the National Liberal Party list refused to join the European People's Party group, and continued to stay a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group. After the 2014 presidential election, MEP Renate Weber, second candidate on the National Liberal Party list, resigned the European People's Party group, and joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group. After the completion of the merger of the two parties, the two MEPs were given an ultimatum to join the European People's Party group or face party exclusion. They failed to fulfill the request and thus were expelled from the National Liberal Party, and currently stand with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group. Later, MEP Norica Nicolai joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats.
In late August 2017, MEP Ramona Mănescu, third candidate on the National Liberal Party list, resigned the party, but continued to stand with the European People's Party group.
In May 2018, People's Movement Party MEP Siegfried Mureșan, spokesman of the European People's Party, announced he is leaving the party to join the National Liberal Party.
Journalist Rareș Bogdan, formerly a staunch opponent to the liberals, was officially nominated as head of the PNL list for the European Parliament elections, which also contains, among others, former co-president of PNL Vasile Blaga, MEPs Siegfried Mureșan, Adina Vălean, Daniel Buda, Cristian Bușoi, Marian-Jean Marinescu and Mihai Țurcanu, and mayors Mircea Hava and Gheorghe Falcă.
Democratic Liberal Party.
Three days after the 2014 election, on 28 May 2014, Democratic Liberal Party president Vasile Blaga confirmed the announcement made by National Liberal Party president Crin Antonescu, that the two parties were to merge into a new party, that would retain the name of the latter and international affiliation of the former. To express discontent with this decision, and the lack of a PDL candidate to the presidential election, MEP Monica Macovei, second candidate on the Democratic Liberal Party list resigned the party in September 2014, and competed in the 2014 presidential election as an independent. Following the presidential election, she joined, as an independent politician, the European Conservatives and Reformists.

Erich Haarmann

Erich Haarmann (14 June 1882 – 17 April 1945) was a German geologist known for his tectonic theories. In a 1930 publication Haarmann wrote in detail about his oscillation theory to explain movements, structure and relief in Earth's crust.
In Haarmanns oscillation theory "geotumors" came to protrude from Earth's surface as result of a drag force in space. These vertical movements resulted in radial forces with gave way to phenomenons like mountain building. Gravitational sliding in the flanks of these bulges resulted in orogenic structures like the stacking o nappes. His oscillation theory was "fixist": it opposed mobilism and continental drift. It was different other contemporary fixist theories that emphasized lateral compression of geosynclines between cratons. Haarmann's theory was almost universally rejected except in the Soviet Union where geologists found that an approach focusing on vertical rather lateral movement was convenient to explain features of the Russian Platform.

Ella Seaver Owen

Ella Seaver Owen (February 26, 1852 – November 11, 1910) was an American artist and teacher. For many years, she taught oil, watercolor, and china painting, and was one of the pioneers, outside of New York City, in china firing. Owen was one of the first women admitted to the University of Vermont, and was one of the founders of the Alpha Rho out of which grew Lambda of Kappa Alpha Theta.
Early years and education.
Ella Seaver was born in Williamstown, Vermont, February 26, 1852. Her father, Asahel Bingham Seaver, born and brought up in Williamstown, Vermont, was a descendant of Robert Seaver, an Englishman, who came to the United States in the seventeenth century. Her mother, whose maiden name was Aurelia Adams, was also of English descent. Owen was one of two children. When she was an infant, her father moved to Burlington, Vermont, where he was a successful teacher in the public schools for many years. Her brother, Harlan Page Seaver, moved later to Springfield, Massachusetts.
From early childhood, Owen was fond of pencil and color-box, and, as she grew older, she had the best instruction in drawing and painting the town afforded. Fond of study, she was ambitious to receive a college education and prepared in the high school, studying Greek. When, in 1872, the University of Vermont, in Burlington, opened its doors to women, she entered it and was graduated in 1876, taking the degree of A. B.
Career.
After teaching a few terms in the Clarke Schools for Hearing and Speech, in Northampton, Massachusetts, she decided to go to the Cooper Union School of Art, in Manhattan. Before that move, she had decorated small articles, which had begun to find sale at home. It was in the beginning of the decorative craze, when the term "hand-painted" was expected to sell anything to which it could be applied. She looked about and found such inartistic things on sale in the stores in New York that she offered some of her work, and was gratified to have it readily taken and more ordered. She found herself able, besides spending four hours a day in the art-school, to earn enough by decorative work to pay her expenses and graduate from the normal designing-class in May, 1880. A part of the time, she was a member of the sketch-class in the Art Students League of New York and took lessons in china painting in the school later called the Osgood Art School.
On August 18, 1880, she married Frank Allen Owen, a chemist, born and reared in Burlington. She continued her art and sent work to the women's exchanges, and with those societies, had much profitable experience. She taught painting in her own and neighboring towns, having had, in all, several hundreds of pupils. In 1881, she became interested in china-firing. From the time she left the art school, she worked constantly in oils and watercolors. In 1886, having acquired a large number of studies and receiving many calls to rent them, she decided to classify them and to send out price lists, offering to rent studies and send them by mail anywhere in the U.S. and Canada. That venture proved successful. She had calls from every State in the Union.
Personal life.
Owen had three children, and her mother lived with the family. She died at her home in Burlingon on November 11, 1910, after a short illness.

Hermann von Schleinitz

Hermann Carl von Schleinitz ( – c. 17 January 1877) was an educator in the early days of the colony of South Australia. He founded Adelaide's first German School.
History.
Schleinitz was born in Germany the only son of an Oberfurstmeister (forestry supervisor) and cousin of Baron Alexander von Schleinitz. He was educated at the universities of Leipzig and Greifswald, and was himself an officer in the Forestry Service.
After the failed students' revolt of 1848, in which he took the liberal side, he found his politics detrimental to his career prospects, and emigrated to South Australia, arriving in Adelaide aboard "Pauline" from Bremen in December 1849.
For several years he was clerk to C. Schilling, landbroker of Gawler Place.
In 1851 he founded a German School in Freeman Street (now the stretch of Gawler Place between Grenfell and Wakefield streets), catering to boys and girls, both native-born English and German speakers, English classes being taken by Henry Nootnagel. In March 1852 he was naturalized as a British subject; that same year had J. C. Hansen took over his school "during Mr. Schleinitz's temporary absence." The Deutsche Schule moved to Flinders Street and was still in operation under Hansen in 1857.
Johann Christian Hansen (c. 1814 – 10 May 1885) was one of the first teachers licensed in South Australia, was born in Prussia. He emigrated to South Australia aboard "Australia", arriving in May 1849. He ran the German School on Freeman Street during von Schleinitz's absence, later ran schools in Pirie Street and at his home in Arthur Street, Unley. He also excelled as an organist, composer, chess player and composer of mathematical puzzles. He returned to Germany c. 1877 and died in Jardelund, close to his birthplace Osterby, both near Flensburg in Schleswig-Holstein.
Schleinitz's whereabouts from 1852 have yet to be discovered; he reappeared in 1863 in his previous role as a commission agent in Gawler Place.
Between 1864 and 1873 he took French and German classes at Adelaide Educational Institution, St Peter's College and Norwood Grammar School, then, finding the constant travelling a strain on his incipient lameness, restricted his teaching to classes at his North Terrace, east, home, where he had been taking evening classes from July 1866.
His successor at St. Peter's College was (Karl or Carl) Emil Jung LLD (1833–1902), formerly of Tanunda, and later Inspector of Schools. He returned to Germany around 1875 and there published "Der Welttheil Australien", "The Australian region", (four volumes), English abridgement published in one volume as "Australia: The Country and its Inhabitants".
By 1876 he was advertising for employment: anything, anywhere.
He died early the following year, and his remains buried in the West Terrace Cemetery.

Cedar Rapids Silver Bullets

The Cedar Rapids Silver Bullets were a professional basketball team based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa from 1988 to 1991. They played in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), the defunct development league for the National Basketball Association (NBA).
History.
Cincinnati Slammers relocation.
The franchise was purchased for an undisclosed amount by Krause Gentle, the parent company of Kum &amp; Go convenience stores. The company announced their intentions to relocate the team to Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The team's 1988-89 schedule was printed on soda cups that were sold at Kum &amp; Go locations. 
 The name "Silver Bullets" was chosen because the team was sponsored by Coors Light, which marketed the "silver bullet can". 
Cedar Rapids (1988–1991).
The Silver Bullets played their home games at the 7,200 seat Five Seasons Center (now U.S. Cellular Center). Kevin Krause, whose father owned the team through their parent company Krause Gentle, served as the team's president.
Lewis Lloyd, who was banned from playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) due to a violation of their drug policy, sought a court injunction in 1988 to allow him to play in the CBA after his contract with the Cedar Rapids Silver Bullets was rejected by CBA commissioner Jay Ramsdell. Lloyd had been participating in the league's rehabilitation program and qualified for reinstatement on March 19. 1989, but through his lawyer challenged the legality of the CBA's drug policy. On December 21, 1988 Linn County, Iowa District Judge William Thomas ruled that the CBA had a right to bar players who had a history of drug use. Ramsdell testified at the hearing that the CBA did not test for cannabis during their drug screenings.
On December 30, 1989, Rockford Lightning head coach Charley Rosen was arrested in Cedar Rapids for assaulting Silver Bullets head coach George Whittaker. Rosen was restrained from attacking Whittaker on the court by referees and ejected from the game. After Cedar Rapids posted a 119–98 victory over the Lightning, Rosen met Whittaker in the hallway outside of the Silver Bullets locker room and struck him in the neck and shoulder. According to the Associated Press, Rosen was angry that Whittaker's team was running up the score. As a result of the altercation, the CBA suspended Rosen eight games and fined him an undisclosed amount. In April 1990, Rosen plead guilty to the misdemeanor assault charge.
The 1990 CBA All-Star Game was held in Cedar Rapids, Iowa on January 18. The game was sponsored by LA Gear, who announced on the broadcast that they were the official shoe of the CBA. John Starks appeared in the 1990 CBA All-Star Game as a member of the Silver Bullets. During a game late in the season, Starks pushed a referee which led his suspension from the CBA. Starks would eventually become an NBA All-Star with the New York Knicks in 1994.
Bimm Ridder Sportswear, an athletic apparel manufacturer, got its start making products for the Silver Bullets and the Minor League Baseball team, the Cedar Rapids Reds.
Relocation to Tri-Cities, Washington.
In June 1991, the CBA approved the re-location of the Cedar Rapids franchise to Tri-Cities, Washington. The team would later be known as the Tri-City Chinook who played their home games at Tri-Cities Coliseum in Kennewick, Washington.

Visconti Castle (Cusago)

The Visconti Castle or Castello Visconteo is a castle in the town of Cusago near Milan, Lombardy, Northern Italy. It was built in the 14th century by Bernabò Visconti and used as a hunting lodge by him and other members of his family. The castle underwent significant changes in the Renaissance period. Today it is in a state of neglect.
History.
Bernabò Visconti was lord of Milan between 1354 and 1385. He ordered the construction of the castle of Cusago in 1370. It had a quadrilateral plant, with a single tower over the entrance. It was created as a country residence and connected to a hunting park. The most extended side measured 96 meters. 
The court of Bernabò Visconti frequently attended the castle. After the dethronement of Bernabò, the building passed to his nephew Gian Galeazzo, the first duke of Milan. Between 1425 and 1440, the Duke Filippo Maria Visconti took great care of the castle and the surrounding park. His mistress Agnese del Maino occasionally lived there. In 1438 a little canal (the "naviglietto") was excavated to connect the castle to the nearby Naviglio Grande.
After the Ambrosian Republic (1447-1450), the castle was abandoned, and part of the lands was sold. In 1496, Ludovico il Moro expanded the castle, restoring its function of a country villa for hunting and parties. A portico with eight arches was added to the entrance side towards the courtyard. A loggia was inserted in the north-eastern corner. The tower assumed the shape with the overlapping volumes, typical of the Sforza architecture, as it appears at the Castello Sforzesco in Milan.
In 1496, Ludovico il Moro hosted in the castle the emperor Maximilian I. Later, and until the 20th century, it was used as an agriculture warehouse and home for the farmers. The loggia was closed by a wall.
Today.
Ceased its agricultural use, the castle was abandoned. Today it is in a poor state of repair, awaiting restoration. 
The castle stands as a backdrop to the Cusago central square. It is faced, on the opposite side, by the church of Saints Firmus and Rusticus.

Ringo Bunoan

Ringo S. Bunoan is a Filipino artist, curator, research and writer based in Manila, Philippines. She is known for her conceptual approach, working across media in installation, sound, video, bookworks and writing. She earned her bachelor's degree in Art History from the University of the Philippines, Dillman. Her works have been shown in galleries, museums and alternative art spaces in Manila, across Asia and the Pacific and USA, including Center for Contemporary Photography, Melbourne, 4th Gwangju Biennale, Singapore Art Museum, Busan Biennale Sea Art Festival, Asian Art Museum, Walter McBean Galleries in San Francisco and REDCAT Gallery in Los Angeles, and Campbelltown Arts Centre, Sydney.
Artist-Run Spaces.
In 1999, Bunoan co-founded Big Sky Mind, an independent art space located first in New Manila and later in Cubao, Quezon City, a gallery and café that she ran with collaborator Katya Guerrero from 1999 to 2001 before it became a space for artists’ projects until 2004. Big Sky Mind was part of the second generation of artist-run spaces founded in Manila. The goal of the centre was to create awareness about contemporary Filipino art on both a local and global scale, and to provide young artists with working studios and other support facilities that enabled them to produce and develop their work. Bunoan and Guerrero later went on to co-found Artbooks.ph, an independent bookstore that focuses on Philippine art. 
Bunoan writes that the work of the artist-run spaces was crucial for young artists especially in the 1990s, as most of the local galleries exhibited traditional paintings and sculptures by established artists.
Solo Exhibitions.
Her solo exhibitions include "Bookworks" at Mo_space in 2016; "How Can I Come Back When I Never Left?" at Manila Contemporary in 2013; "In Advance of the Things We Cannot See" at Mo_space in 2012; "Pillow Talk" at Silverlens Gallery in 2008; and "Little Deaths" at Mo_space in 2008.
Archival and Curatorial Work.
From 2007 to 2013, Bunoan was active as a researcher for the Philippines for the Hong Kong-based nonprofit organization Asia Art Archive, where she worked on Filipino artist-run spaces and the work of Roberto Chabet. The digitalized materials of this archive is publicly accessible from Asia Art Archive's website. 
In 2009, Bunoan organized "Archiving Roberto Chabet", an exhibition hosted at the UP Vargas Museum. This exhibition highlighted Chabet's early drawings and collages from the 1960s and his recent artworks.
The physical archive of Roberto Chabet was absorbed into King Kong Art Projects Unlimited in Manila, which was established by Chabet's former students, including Bunoan, Nilo Ilarde, Mawen Ong, Soler Santos, and MM Yu. This group of artists organized "Chabet: Fifty Years", a series of exhibitions, talks, and publications in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Manila, which focused on Chabet's artworks as well as materials from his archive.
In 2016 Bunoan curated the Marker program of the Art Dubai Contemporary Art Fair, focusing on artist-run culture in the Philippines. In 2018, Bunoan was chief curator of the inaugural Manila Biennale, which took place in Intramuros, and ran from February 3 to March 5, 2018. She curated OPENCITY, a site-specific exhibition, and worked with co-curators Con Cabrera, Alice Sarmiento, Cocoy Lumbao, Matthew Lopez, and Monchito Nocon.
Awards.
She was the recipient of Cultural Center of the Philippines' 2003 Thirteen Artists Award and Silverlens' Foundation 2007 Completion Grant, and was shortlisted for the 2009 Ateneo Art Awards.

RAF Ripon

Royal Air Force Ripon (also known as Royal Flying Corps Ripon) was a First World War airfield maintained by the Royal Flying Corps in the city of Ripon, North Yorkshire, England. The airfield was home to No. 76 Squadron which was employed on Home Defence (HD) in the United Kingdom. The airfield was created when the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) commandeered the southern half of Ripon Racecourse in 1916. After the end of the First World War, the airfield was returned to horse-racing.
History.
In 1916, the southern part of Ripon Racecourse, only south-west of the city of Ripon, was pressed into service as a base for No. 76 Squadron RFC. No. 76 Squadron was employed on Home Defence duties and had individual flights located at Catterick, Copmanthorpe and Helperby, with Ripon acting as the headquarters. Other landing grounds could be used in an emergency (RAF Manywells Height), though in practice, lesser used locations saw very little activity (if any). As with the other landing grounds in Yorkshire, the site at Ripon was quite compact, covering only with basic facilities. The role of 76 Squadron at the base was in countering any German threats from air, most notably the Zeppelin airships that would try bombing runs across the north.
In 1917, No. 189 Squadron formed at RFC Ripon as a night training squadron and its stay at the airfield was short (only 5 months) before moving south to Suttons Farm. On 1 April 1918, the Royal Air Force was formed from the RFC and the Royal Naval Air Service. RFC Ripon was changed to Royal Air Force Ripon, though this name would only exist for 11 months.
No. 76 Squadron moved to Tadcaster in March 1919 and was disbanded there just three months later. The airfield at Ripon was returned to the racecourse owners. Even after this, the portion of the racecourse to the south was used to land civilian flights including Sir Alan Cobham's Circus in the 1920s. The site was re-used during the Second World War as a Prisoner of War (PoW) camp.
During the Second World War, RAF Dishforth, some to the east of Ripon was also commonly known as RAF Ripon due to its proximity to the town, but this was a purely unofficial name. The town also had another civilian airfield, due south of the city, that existed briefly in the 1920s.

Early years.
Phan began learning to skate in 2006. As a young child, he trained at CPA Asticou in Gatineau, Quebec. In the 2012–2013 season, he was coached by Jocelyne Leduc, Nathalie Martin, and Sylvie Fullum in Saint-Leonard, Quebec.
The 2013–2014 season was his first as a member of École Excellence Rosemère, a club led by Yvan Desjardins in Rosemère, Quebec. After winning the national novice men's title at the 2014 Canadian Championships, Phan moved up to the junior level and placed fifth at the 2015 Canadian Championships. Later in 2015, he struggled due to a growth spurt of five inches. He became the national junior men's champion at the 2016 Canadian Championships.
2016–2017 season.
Competing in September 2016 at his first Junior Grand Prix (JGP) assignments, Phan placed sixth in Ostrava, Czech Republic, and fifth in Ljubljana, Slovenia. In December, he won the senior men's event, ahead of Bennet Toman, at the Skate Canada Challenge and qualified to compete on the same level at the 2017 Canadian National Championships in January. He finished 11th in his senior nationals debut.
2017–2018 season.
Phan began his season in August at the 2017 Junior Grand Prix in Brisbane, Australia; he placed second in the short program, seventh in the free skate, and fourth overall. In September, he won silver at his next JGP assignment, in Zagreb, Croatia, where he finished second to Alexei Krasnozhon of the United States. Competing as a senior domestically, Phan finished first, ahead of Nicolas Nadeau and Nam Nguyen, in December at the Skate Canada Challenge. The following month, he placed eighth in the short, fifth in the free, and sixth overall in the senior men's category at the 2018 Canadian Championships.
Phan placed fourteenth in the short program, third in the free skate, and fourth overall at the 2018 World Junior Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria. He was awarded a small bronze medal for his free skate.
In the off-season Phan landed his first quadruple Lutz.

Henry Daly Building

The Henry J. Daly Building (previously known as the Municipal Center and also referred to as 300 Indiana and the Daly Building) is located at 300 Indiana Avenue, NW, and 301 C Street, NW, in the Judiciary Square neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The administrative building is owned by the government of the District of Columbia and has served as the home of various city offices since it opened in 1941 as a unified location for previously-dispersed municipal functions. Currently, the building is primarily occupied by the Metropolitan Police Department; although the District of Columbia Department of Corrections, the District of Columbia Office of the Chief Financial Officer and the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) also maintain offices in the building. 
Background, 1790–1926.
In his 1791 plan for the federal city, Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L’Enfant had intended the area known as Judiciary Square to be the conglomerated home of the federal judiciary, however by 1840 the square was home to a number of city functions, and by the close of the nineteenth century featured a mix of federal and local government offices.
At the start of the twentieth century, this mixture of federal and local government offices was true for much of the city, and this dispersion started to create problems for both as the federal workforce and city population expanded with the United States' entrance onto the world stage. The federal government was first to attempt a concentration of its administrative functions in the district with the planning of Federal Triangle during the Calvin Coolidge administration. The massive complex of seven buildings situated along Pennsylvania Avenue downtown was not completed until the New Deal in the 1930s, but, once finished, achieved its goal of unifying a number of federal government offices.
Calls for a similar solution to crowded and dispersed municipal functions resulted in Congressional approval in 1926 (the same year Federal Triangle was funded) of an idea to unify municipal courts at Judiciary Square. Eventually, these plans also called for the unification of other municipal functions at Judiciary Square to absorb overcrowded city offices, particularly those of the police department.
Planning and construction, 1926–1941.
The proposed concentration of so many city courts and services at Judiciary Square would require a host of new buildings to fill a campus, which municipal architect Albert I. Harris started to plan in 1926. However, years of trouble slowed Harris's plans as numerous battles with the federal government and Commission of Fine Arts erupted over various issues, including; funding and cost; the specific site of buildings; the architectural relationship with nearby Federal Triangle and the Mall; the specific location of courts and offices; the number of buildings; the demolition of neighborhood buildings; and especially the financial difficulties and priorities of the Great Depression. Along with the staff of the Office of the Municipal Architect, Harris continued to work through these issues and design the campus, until he died in 1934. Upon the death of Harris, Nathan Corwith Wyeth became Municipal Architect. Wyeth, a native of Chicago and an accomplished architect, was associated with the Washington firm Allied Architects and was a close advisor to Harris.
According to the National Register of Historic Places nomination for the Daly Building, “[i]t is impossible to identify any architect’s personal design contributions” to the complex, as almost “all known plans, drawings, and blueprints...are attributed to ‘the Office of the Municipal Architect’.” However, “...Wyeth was the key influence in shaping the Municipal Center Campus.” Yet the ultimate success of the project also depended on Wyeth’s fellow partners at Allied Architects and from the staff of the Office of the Municipal Architect, whose expertise was essential to the process. And it continued to be a frustratingly slow process. But, finally, between 1936 and 1938, a series of Congressional appropriations and Public Works Administration loans finally allowed construction of the Daly Building to begin in 1938. "Washington Post" reporter James D. Secrest summed it up well, writing on September 4, 1938 that "Washingtonians, who have followed the National Capital's progress for the past decade, rubbed their eyes and muttered incantations at the press announcement last week that construction of the Municipal Center finally had been assured." It was complete by 1941.
Yet, original plans had called for a number of other municipal buildings to be built to form a campus around the completed Daly Building in Judiciary Square. But the rest of the intended campus of municipal buildings was never completed, except for the Recorder of Deeds building and a portion of the Central Library office (referred to as the “Library Annex,” it was later demolished to make space for the Canadian Embassy). Land intended for a Municipal Auditorium later hosted the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse, and a plot set aside for the West Building of the Municipal Center became the home of the D.C. Superior Court.
Opening and use, 1941–present.
The first city employees moved into the Daly building on May 19, 1941. However, they were only allowed to use half the structure, as wartime needs prompted the city to allow the federal government to temporarily take over the other half. City offices located in the building initially included the Police Department, Traffic Department, Refuse Department, Fire Department, and Health Laboratory. Currently, the building hosts the Metropolitan Police Department and the Department of Motor Vehicles.
In the years that followed, the building was never a favorite of the citizens, considering that the only reason most residents entered the building was for the Department of Motor Vehicles. A 1983 "Washington Post" article noted that "[f]or many people, merely the mention of the place is enough to conjure up chilling visions of bottomless file cabinets, brusque government clerks and a twilight zone of bureaucratic runarounds." One person even called the 576,000 square foot building "the pinnacle of bureaucracy." And recently, in 2016, Mayor Muriel Bowser, as quoted in the "Washington Business Journal", opined that "[s]ometimes people exaggerate, but it’s probably the worst building in [in the city's] entire portfolio," when she talked about updating the building.
The building witnessed a very unfortunate incident on November 22, 1994. Two FBI agents, Martha Dixon Martinez and Michael J. Miller, and Metropolitan Police Sergeant Henry J. Daly, were shot and killed by a murder suspect who had entered the building. A third FBI agent and a civilian were also wounded. The shooter committed suicide. The "Washington Post" described "Hank" Daly as "a storied homicide detective with nearly three decades on the D.C. police force" and "a dogged investigator who loved his work and a hero and mentor to younger detectives." According to the MPD website, Sergeant Daly, aged 51, left behind a wife and two children. The following year the Municipal Center was renamed the Henry J. Daly Building in his honor.
Art and architecture.
Like many other civic buildings constructed during the New Deal, the Daly Building is an example of the Classical Moderne style. The National Register of Historic Places nomination for the Daly Building notes that “[a]mong the defining Classical Moderne features of the building are its ziggurat configuration achieved through the progressive setback of its upper stories and its use of the abstracted classical form.” Although some had originally called for a Colonial Revival design, the architects of the Municipal Center wanted its design to complement the nearby Hadfield Courthouse and Federal Triangle.
To make up for its overall, spartan appearance (keeping with New Deal ideals), the building contains a good deal of public art, including bas reliefs next to the plaza staircase by Lee Lawrie and John Gregory. There are also murals made from ceramic tiles in the interior courtyards by Hildreth Meiere and Waylande Gregory. A tile mosaic on the C Street lobby floor depicting a map of the District of Columbia by Eric Menke was described by Alexander M. Padro in a January 2000 letter to the "Washington Post" as a "...giant, brilliantly colored and detailed map of the city...made from tens of thousands of tiny pieces of colored stone." On the Indiana Avenue side is the Police Memorial Fountain by John J. Earley, built in 1942 with Italian marble at the hands of Italian immigrants. The idea for such a memorial had been simmering for years, but it finally received funding in 1940. It honors all District police officers killed in the line of duty.
Significance.
According to the National Register of Historic Places nomination, the Municipal Center is historically significant because it "represents...urbanization and the expanding role of government, especially in the areas of public safety and social welfare services, as well as the development of modern municipal administration for the District." In addition, it sits as a physical manifestation of the New Deal in the city, as PWA grants helped fund its construction and it showcases the Classical Moderne style often associated with public buildings from that program. And, on a local level, the idea behind the building's conception, the unification of city services, represents the district's long history of gaining political autonomy from the federal government. The Municipal Center is a tangible landmark on the long road to the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973.
In February 2018, thanks to efforts by the D.C. Preservation League, the Daly Building was officially designated a District of Columbia historic landmark.

2018 Iowa Hawkeyes football team

The 2018 Iowa Hawkeyes football team represented the University of Iowa during the 2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Hawkeyes played their home games at Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City, Iowa and competed in the West Division of the Big Ten Conference. They were led by Kirk Ferentz in his 20th season as head coach.
Iowa began the year with six wins in their first seven games, with their sole loss during that span coming in their conference opener against Wisconsin. The Hawkeyes rose to 18th in the AP Poll, but lost three consecutive games to knock them from the polls. They ended the regular season with two more wins to finish tied for second in the West Division with a conference record of 5–4. They were invited to the 2019 Outback Bowl, where they defeated Mississippi State. Iowa finished with a record of 9–4 and were ranked 25th in the final AP Poll, their first ranked finish and highest win total since 2015.
Quarterback Nate Stanley led the team in passing with 2,852 yards and 26 touchdowns, good for second in the Big Ten Conference in the latter category. The Hawkeyes featured two standout tight ends, with Noah Fant and T. J. Hockenson both earning first-team all-conference honors. Hockenson was awarded the John Mackey Award as the nation's top tight end. Iowa became the first school to have two tight ends chosen in the first round of an NFL Draft when Hockenson and Fant both were both selected in the first 20 picks of the 2019 NFL Draft. Defensive end A. J. Epenesa led the Big Ten in both sacks and forced fumbles. He was joined on the all-conference first-team by safety Amani Hooker, who was named the Big Ten's Defensive Back of the Year.
Previous season.
The Hawkeyes finished the 2017 season 8–5, 4–5 in Big Ten play to finish in a tie for third place in the West Division. They received an invitation to the Pinstripe Bowl where they defeated Boston College.

Northern Illinois.
After a slow start, the Hawkeyes scored touchdowns on three straight possessions en route to a 30-point second half. The win was the 144th for head coach Kirk Ferentz, making him the all-time winningest coach in Iowa football history. After an opening drive 3 and out for the Hawkeyes, NIU blocked the punt and had the ball at the Iowa 20. However, a missed field goal swung momentum back to the home team. The only first half points came on a 33-yard field goal from Hawkeye kicker Miguel Recinos. After a slow 3rd quarter, Heisman hopeful Nate Stanley threw his first touchdown of the year, a 1-yard pitch-and-catch to tight end Noah Fant. On the ensuing drive, running back Ivory Kelly-Martin barreled in on a 3rd and goal play to make it 17–0 going into the 4th quarter. After another short field, Toren Young found pay dirt on a 6-yard effort, and it was 24–0 Iowa. After a great punt by Colton Rastetter, NIU got the ball inside their own 1 yard line. on 2nd down, the Hawkeyes forced a safety, and after getting the ball back off the safety punt, backup quarterback Peyton Mansell got his first career touchdown on a quarterback sneak. After Iowa put their 2nd team defense in, the Huskies marched down the field in an impressive 11 play, 75 yard drive to put some late points on the scoreboard. Iowa shook off the slow 1st half and routed NIU 33–7 inside of Kinnick Stadium during the annual Gold Game.
Iowa State.
Neither offense could get going in this in-state rivalry contest. Iowa was the only team to find the endzone and with only a few minutes left in the fourth quarter. An A. J. Epenesa strip-sack sealed this low-scoring affair to keep the Cy-Hawk trophy in Iowa City for a fourth straight year.
Northern Iowa.
The Panthers were able to play with the Hawkeyes for a while but Iowa's depth proved to be ultimately overwhelming for FCS opponent Northern Iowa. Iowa ended the game with nearly 550 yards of total offense and the final score wasn't indicative of how one-sided this match-up was as the Hawkeyes played their second string for most of the fourth quarter. Iowa's defense had a relentless effort holding Northern Iowa to minus-2 rushing yards in the first half.
at Minnesota.
The Hawkeyes spoiled the Gophers' homecoming in this high-scoring rivalry game. A signature play of the game came on a fake field goal trick play in which T. J. Hockenson took a lateral pass in for a touchdown which helped Iowa secure a lead going into halftime. The play is called "Herky" and was a New Kirk era technique that had yet to been implemented. The Hawks prevailed to keep Floyd of Rosedale in Iowa City for a fourth year in a row.
at Indiana.
Nate Stanley became the third Iowa quarterback to throw six touchdown passes in a single game. Tight ends T. J. Hockenson and Noah Fant each had over 100 yards receiving, totaling eight receptions for 208 yards and three TD.
Maryland.
Iowa held visitor Maryland to just 115 yards of total offense in this shutout homecoming victory. Iowa did struggle to find the end zone but three Miguel Recinos field goals kept Iowa in the driver's seat for most of the way.
at Illinois.
Kirk Ferentz recorded his 150th win at Iowa, the 5th head coach in Big Ten history to reach the mark, in this blowout victory over Illinois. After a sluggish start in the first quarter, Iowa dominated in every phase of the game the rest of the way. Not only scoring on offense but on defense and special teams as well.
Nebraska.
Iowa led the whole way until the final minutes of this nail-biting victory. Nebraska never backed down and tied the game up with 3:22 to play. Miguel Recinos kicked a game-winning field goal as time expired to keep the Heroes Trophy in Iowa City for the fourth year in a row.
vs. Mississippi State (Outback Bowl).
In a back-and-forth game, Iowa held on to defeat SEC opponent Mississippi State. Senior Jake Gervase made a critical interception in the end zone, and batted down a fourth down pass to end the Bulldogs' hopes. The victory was Ferentz's fifth January bowl win and eighth overall bowl victory.

Auspicious (1797 ship)

Auspicious was built in 1797. The British East India Company (EIC), chartered her for a voyage to Bengal and back. At Calcutta a fire almost destroyed her. She was rebuilt there some years later. She served as a transport vessel in the British government's expedition to the Red Sea in 1801. She then sailed to England, again under charter to the EIC. In 1811 she sailed to Bengal to remain. She was sold in 1821 either to or Arabs.
Career.
"" entered "Lloyd's Register" in 1797 with S. Falker, master, changing to D. Merrylees. Her owner was S. Baker, and her first voyage was Lynn–London. Her trade then changed to London–India.
The EIC engaged "Auspicious" as an "extra ship" and had her measured and surveyed by Cox. Captain David Merrylees (or Mirrylees) acquired a letter of marque on 8 April 1797. On 7 May he sailed for Bengal.
A fire aboard "Auspicious" at Calcutta on 18 July 1797 almost destroyed her. She was preparing to sail back to London and had about 400 tons of goods on board. None of the cargo belonged to the EIC. "Auspicious" was rebuilt at Sulkea. The rebuilding apparently took place in 1801.
The British government hired a number of transport vessels to support Major-General Sir David Baird's expedition in 1801 to the Red Sea. Baird was in command of the Indian army that was going to Egypt to help General Ralph Abercromby expel the French there. Baird landed at Kosseir, on the Egyptian side of the Red Sea. He then led his troops army across the desert to Kena on the Nile, and then to Cairo. He arrived in time for the battle of Alexandria. Captain Hardie of "Shah Kaikusroo" was appointed Commodore of the fleet of country ships, "Auspicious" among them.
In 1803 "Auspicious" was recorded as being registered at Calcutta. Her master was John Barker, and her owner Robert Lawson.
Captain John Baker sailed from Calcutta on 26 March 1803, bound for England. On 21 May "Auspicious" was at Sagar Island, and on 29 June Penang. She reached Saint Helena on 12 October. "Lloyd's List" reported that "Auspicious", Barker, master, from Bengal, had lost her anchor and two cables in Margate Roads. She arrived at Deptford on 27 December.
In England Captain John Barker acquired a letter of marque on 14 March 1804. On 4 April "Auspicious" paid £3315 7s 8d for fitting out and provisioning for her return voyage to Bengal.
In 1809 "Auspicious" master was Robert Lawson and her owner John Ferguson.
"Auspicious", Hugh Atkins Reid, owner, appeared on a list of vessels registered at Calcutta in January 1811. Later that year she underwent fitting in England at a cost of £1851 13s 9d. She then sailed to Bengal to remain, arriving there on 4 February 1812. "Lloyd's List" reported on 28 August that "Auspicious" had put into Cape Town to repair some trifling damage from a lightning strike. "Auspicious" underwent a good repair and a thorough repair in 1813.
In 1819 "Auspicious" was registered at Calcutta with D. McDonald &amp; Co, owner, and J. Neish, master.
Fate.
In January 1821 her owners sold "Auspicious" to Arabs, or Malabars.
The issues of "Lloyd's Register" and the "Register of Shipping" for 1822 (i.e., published after her sale but before the news of it reached England, provide useful information, though some of it is contradictory.
"Lloyd's Register" gives her origin as Newcastle and her burthen as 492 tons, apparently somewhat conflating the present "Auspicious" with an "Auspicious" of 463 tons (bm), launched at Newcastle in 1799 and wrecked in 1801. The "Register of Shipping" gives the present "Auspicious"s origin as Lynn, but gives a launch year of 1796. Both sources provide some useful data on interim repairs.

Nick Ebert

Nick Ebert (born May 11, 1994) is an American professional ice hockey defenseman for Örebro HK of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL). He was drafted in the seventh round, 211th overall, in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft by the Los Angeles Kings.
Playing career.
Junior.
Ebert was drafted in the first round, 17th overall, by the Windsor Spitfires in the 2010 OHL Draft. Ebert was named to the OHL First All-Rookie Team at the conclusion of the 2010–2011 season. Originally considered to be a top draft pick, a poor sophomore season led to Ebert dropping to the seventh round of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft where he was picked by the Los Angeles Kings as the last pick in the draft. On December 3, 2013, he was traded to the Guelph Storm along with captain Kerby Rychel in exchange for Brody Milne and eight OHL Draft picks. Ebert was assigned to the Ontario Reign after the conclusion of the 2012–13 OHL season to help them compete in the playoffs. Ebert was returned to the OHL for the following season where he helped Storm win the J. Ross Robertson Cup as OHL Champions.

Ebert signed a three-year entry-level contract with the Kings on May 28, 2014. He won the Calder Cup with the Manchester Monarchs the following season. In June 2016, Ebert was traded by the Los Angeles Kings to the Dallas Stars in exchange for Jack Campbell.
In the 2016–17 season, after attending the Dallas Stars training camp, Ebert was assigned for the duration of the year to AHL affiliate, the Texas Stars. In solidifying a top-four role on the blueline with Texas, Ebert produced a career-best 9 goals and 16 assists for 25 points in 68 games.

In June 2019, Ebert, with hopes of revitalizing his North American professional hockey career, used his NHL out-clause to secure his release from Örbero in signing a one-year, two-way contract with the Ottawa Senators of the NHL.
After participating in the Senators training camp, Ebert was reassigned to begin the 2019–20 season with AHL affiliate, the Belleville Senators. After just one game in Belleville, on October 7, 2019, Ebert was traded by the Senators, along with a fourth-round pick in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft, to the New York Rangers in exchange for Russian forward Vladislav Namestnikov. Ebert played out the remainder of the season in the AHL with the Hartford Wolf Pack, compiling 5 goals and 16 points in 46 games before the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As an impending free agent from the Rangers, Ebert opted to return to Sweden and rejoin his former club, Örebro HK of the SHL, on a two-year contract on June 24, 2020.

Yu Teng-fa

Yu Teng-fa (; 21 September 1904 – 13 September 1989) was a Taiwanese politician. His family's influence in Kaohsiung began with his own political career. Yu's daughter in-law Yu Chen Yueh-ying succeeded his daughter Huang Yu Hsiu-luan in the Legislative Yuan. Yu Teng-fa played a large role in Yu Chen's political career, and his grandchildren Yu Lin-ya, Yu Jane-daw, and Yu Cheng-hsien have also served in the Legislative Yuan.
Born to a family of wealthy farmers, Yu Teng-fa began his political career in 1947, when he was elected a Kuomintang member of the National Assembly. He left the KMT in 1948, though he remained friends with party members, namely Chen Hsin-an. Yu succeeded Chen Chieh-hsing as Kaohsiung County magistrate in 1960. That same year, he founded the China Democratic Self Government Research Association. His followers were known as the "black faction." Yu was invited to join the tangwai movement for democratization, and he did so. However, he remained opposed to Taiwanese independence, preferring unification with China. Yu yielded the Kaohsiung magistracy to Tai Liang-chin of Kaohsiung's "red faction" in 1963. The Kuomintang charged Yu with embezzlement, and he was jailed.
Elections to the National Assembly and Legislative Yuan were scheduled for December 1978, but postponed after the United States announced that it would soon diplomatically recognize the People's Republic of China. Yu protested the postponement of the elections, stating that the decision was unconstitutional, exposing the Kuomintang's penchant for relying on martial law. In January 1979, he and his son Yu Jui-yen were arrested prior to a demonstration against the postponement of elections and formally charged with "knowing a Communist and not reporting it." Yu's arrest led to a large protest organized by Hsu Hsin-liang. The event became known as the and was the first political demonstration since martial law was enacted in May 1949. The January 1979 protest prompted Hsu's impeachment by the Control Yuan, which in turn contributed to December's Kaohsiung Incident. Yu's alleged collaborator, Wu Tai-an, also known as Wu Chun-fa, went to trial shortly after Yu's arrest. Proceedings against Yu Teng-fa and Yu Jui-yen began in March 1979, and were overseen by a military court of the Taiwan Garrison Command. During his trial, Yu Teng-fa was represented by Yao Chia-wen. On 16 April 1979, Yu was sentenced to eight years imprisonment. In her memoir, Annette Lu wrote that the charges against Yu were "an elaborate frame up." Three years later, Yu was released on medical parole. In 1986, while serving as magistrate of Kaohsiung, Yu Teng-fa's daughter in-law Yu Chen Yueh-ying merged the "black faction" with the Democratic Progressive Party. On 13 September 1989, Yu Teng-fa was found dead at his home in Kaohsiung. He had been injured in the back of the head, and was lying in a supine position. In 1995, Kao Ming-hui, a retired deputy chief of the Investigation Bureau based in Kaohsiung, wrote that charges against Yu were fabricated by Kao's agency, additionally stating that Yu was mentally unstable and could not recognize the flag of the People's Republic of China when questioned.

Lucinda Cisler

Lucinda Cisler (born October 30, 1938) is an American abortion rights activist, Second Wave feminist, and member of the New York-based radical feminist group the Redstockings. Her writings on unnecessary obstructions to medical abortion procedures in many ways predicted anti-abortion strategies in the 2010s, called Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers (TRAP) by abortion rights advocates.
Education.
Lucinda Cisler received the Betty Crocker Homemaker of Tomorrow Award for her high school in California in 1955. Cisler graduated from Vassar College in 1959. She received a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Yale University and a Masters of Architecture and Certificate in Civic Design from the University of Pennsylvania. Cisler attended the University of Pennsylvania on a Sears-Roebuck Foundation Fellowships. During her years at Yale she designed the Residence Hall at Vassar College. She wrote “A place where a student lives can challenge and welcome her as much as her books and teachers can.” 
Activism.
Lucinda Cisler has been a part of the feminist movement since 1968. Initially, she was highly concerned about women in the design field. She also became an abortion rights activist, advocating for women to have complete freedom to abortion and to deciding whether and when to terminate a pregnancy. As a member of the Redstockings, Cisler participated in the 1968 picketing of the Miss America pageant that introduced the women's liberation movement to mainstream media. She marched with a sign that read: "women are enslaved by beauty standards." She contributed a chapter, "Unfinished Business : Birth control and women's liberation", to "Sisterhood is Powerful : An Anthology of Writings from the Women's Liberation Movement", edited by Robin Morgan. Lucinda Cisler helped produce and annotate the book, "Rebirth of Feminism". The book is made up of ten sections of topics including early feminist writings, history and literary criticism. 
Abortion Rights Activism.
Cisler devoted majority of her time to writing and taking part in political activity for the annulment of all laws related to abortion and contraception. Cisler's essay on anti-abortion tactics appeared in the publication "Notes from the Second Year: Women's Liberation", edited by Shulamith Firestone. "Abortion law repeal (sort of): a Warning to Women," argued that settling for reform to existing abortion law would result in a world "in which abortion is grudgingly parceled out by hospital committee fiat to the few women who can 'prove' they’ve been raped, or who are crazy, or are in danger of bearing a defective baby." Cisler claimed justice for women would come only when they are one hundred percent free from any restrictions regarding abortions. This comes from the idea that while change is happening in policies regarding abortion, supporting little changes rather than waiting for a drastic turn around is only making it harder to throw them out later. Cisler advocates for no restrictions on abortions. Typical legal restrictions include abortions only being allowed to be performed in licensed hospitals by a licensed physician, not being permitted after a certain stage of pregnancy (unless there is a risk to the women's life), and with a husband or parent's consent. “Steps in the right direction” are an insult and reform is only dividing women not bringing them together, Cisler wrote in an early essay. In 1972, she joined the "Ms". magazine campaign, “We Have Had Abortions,” which called for an end to "archaic laws" limiting reproductive freedom, and encouraged women to share their stories and take action. Cisler wrote a discussion paper with James Clapp called “Abortion Ruling: Some Good News… and Some Bad News” discussing the outcomes of the United States ruling in relation to pro-abortion. The paper discussed what the court said on the issue, the idea of rights to life and protection as well as alternative strategies. The paper was written in order to help educate women on what the ruling meant in regards to them and the policy makers, as well as encourage independence and publicize the women's movement occurring. Lucinda also wrote the article, "Abortion: A Major Battle is Over- - But The War Isn’t." This article examines the Supreme Court's pro abortion ruling.

Harriet Persis Hurlbut

Harriet Persis Hurlbut (February 26, 1862 – ?) was an American artist. Like her father, she was fond of historical and genealogical matters. One of her paintings hangs in the rooms of the Chicago Historical Society, being a portrait of the early explorer, Samuel de Champlain.
Early years and education.
Harriet Persis Hurlbut was born in Racine, Wisconsin, February 26, 1862. She was the youngest child and only daughter of Henry Higgins Hurlbut, the author of several works, among them "Chicago Antiquities" and "Hurlbut Genealogy". Through her mother, Harriet Elizabeth Sykes Hurlbut, she traced her ancestry back to four of the Mayflower pilgrims, among them Priscilla Mullins and her husband, John Alden. The line of descent through their daughter, Ruth, included the names of Deacon Samuel Bass, his daughter, Mary Bass Bowditch, Abigail Bowditch, Jeremiah Pratt, and Harriette Partridge Pratt, who married Dr. Royal S. Sykes, of Dorset, Vermont, and was the grandmother of Miss Hurlbut. She had two brothers, Sidney Sykes Hurlbut and Jonathan Henry Hurlbut (died 1871).
With her family, she moved to Chicago in the winter of 1873, and resided in that city ever since. She was graduated from Park Institute, Chicago, it June, 1880. An early fondness for drawing turned her attention to art, and she entered the studio of Professor Peter Baumgras, with whom she pursued her studies in sketching and oil painting almost continuously for eight years. 
Career.
Her first venture was in connection with Mrs. Mary B. Baumgras. Together, they opened a studio in Chicago. Hurlbut's best known picture was the life-size portrait of Samuel de Champlain, which forms part of the Chicago Historical Society's collection. Always of a serious cast of mind, Hurlbut passed her later years in retirement, with her brother, in the paternal home in Chicago, where she devoted herself to the completion of a family record book, which her father began long before.

Vladimir Georgievich Turaev (Владимир Георгиевич Тураев, born in 1954) is a Russian mathematician, specializing in topology.
Turaev received in 1979 from the Steklov Institute of Mathematics his Candidate of Sciences degree (PhD) under Oleg Viro. Turaev was a professor at the University of Strasbourg and then became a professor at Indiana University. In 2016 he was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.
Turaev's research deals with low-dimensional topology, quantum topology, and knot theory and their interconnections with quantum field theory. In 1991 Reshetikhin and Turaev published a mathematical construction of new topological invariants of compact oriented 3-manifolds and framed links in these manifolds, corresponding to a mathematical implementation of ideas in quantum field theory published by Witten; the invariants are now called Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (or Reshetikhin-Turaev) invariants. In 1992 Turaev and Viro introduced a new family of invariants for 3-manifolds by using state sums computed on triangulations of manifolds; these invariants are now called Turaev-Viro invariants.
In 1990 Turaev was an Invited Speaker with talk "State sum models in low dimensional topology" at the ICM in Kyōto. In 2016 he shared, with Alexis Virelizier, the Ferran Sunyer i Balaguer Prize for their monograph "Monoidal categories and topological field theory".

Argyritzos

Argyritzos (fl. 1071–81) was one of the leading citizens of Bari during the final years of Byzantine rule. He held the rank of "protospatharios" under the empire. His father was named Ioannakes.
When the Normans besieged Bari in 1068–71, Argyritzos led the faction that favoured seeking terms. On 18 July 1070, the leader of the opposite faction, Bisantius Guirdeliku, was assassinated through the "treachery" of Argyritzos, according to the "Annales Barenses" and the "Annales Lupi Protospatharii". Still, the city held out for another nine months. Argyritzos appears to have inherited a leading position following its surrender on favourable terms to the Norman leader Robert Guiscard.
According to the chronicler William of Apulia, Robert "entrusted the city" to Argyritzos. If he did, it was short-lived. By 1075, the city's governors were one Lizius the viscount, probably a Norman, and Maurelianus the catepan, a local with the imperial rank of "patrikios".
In 1078, Argyritzos arranged the marriage of his daughter to Abelard, Robert's nephew, who was planning a rebellion. The revolt broke out on 3 February 1079. Robert re-captured Bari the following year and in April 1081 Argyritzos fled to the court of King Mihailo Vojislavljević of Duklja, a Byzantine vassal. There he arranged the marriage of his daughter Jaquinta to Mihailo's son Bodin.
The date of Argyritzos' death is unknown. An epitaph for a "Kyri" (Lord) "Ioannatius" in the church of Santa Maria de' Sannaci in Gioia del Colle, a suburb of Bari, has been identified as his.

Márcio Piancastelli (1936-2015) was a car designer. He is best known for his work at Volkswagen do Brasil where he designed the Volkswagen SP2 and the Volkswagen Brasília, as well as redesigned the Brazilian market Volkswagen Type 3. Piancastelli died on June 18, 2015, having suffered from serious illnesses for years.
Career.
When he was 26, Piancastelli won the Lucio Meira Prize design contest with his designs for a small sports car called the Itapuan, winning him a one-year internship at Carrozzeria Ghia in Turin, Italy. Subsequently, he was hired by Willys Overland Do Brasil where he worked on the development of "Project M", which would later become the Ford Corcel after Ford took over the company in 1967. Before that project was finished though, Piancastelli left Willys and joined Volkswagen, where he produced his most famous designs. Piancastelli's first project at Volkswagen in 1969 was to facelift the Volkswagen Type 3 for the Brazilian market. The next project he took on was designing a car to compete with the Brazilian made Puma while still using the already existent Volkswagen Type III platform. The result was the Volkswagen SP2. The original car used an existing 1600cc Volkswagen engine but that model was quickly discontinued and all later models used an upgraded 1700cc engine. Piancastelli's next big project was to build an economy car off of the Volkswagen Beetle chassis that would be a successor to the Beetle. Piancastelli's design became the Volkswagen Brasília and was a great success, selling over 950,000 units in Brazil and 180,000 internationally.

The Victor F. Lawson House is a historic former YMCA building located at 30 W. Chicago Avenue in the Near North Side neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The building was built in 1931 for the YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago, which was established in 1858 and had grown considerably during the 1920s. It was named for newspaperman Victor Lawson, one of the YMCA's largest donors until his death in 1925. The architecture firm of Perkins, Chatten &amp; Hammond designed the 24-story building in the Art Deco style.

Michael A. Russ

Michael Andreas Russ (born January 1945 in Berlin — September 27, 2021) was an American photographer, photo designer and film director.
In reference to his artistic cooperation " Swordfishtrombones" album cover production, singer Tom Waits commented on Russ' work: “His approach to photography is with the eyes of a painter working with light. This technique is what drew me to Michael’s work in the beginning”.
Russ' career as a photographer began in New York in the late 1960s where he photographed his fellow acting students. Self-taught, evolving his own style: 'The grainy picture appearing horizontally in subtle motion as though it came of the silver screen'. A black and white photograph by Russ, inspired by an Ingmar Bergman film was published on the cover of “Art Direction, The Magazine of Visual Communication” with a Gertrude Stein quotation: “The composition in which we live makes the art which we see and hear”. He eventually moved to his own studio off Union Square, Manhattan and connected with the local underground art scene. In his early years Russ focused on men's fashion magazines and erotic sequential photographic scenes for Playboy Press books. He soon experimented with distinctive photographic techniques, turning 35mm black and white film into chemically toned, masked, solarized and hand colored, 'one of a kind' silver gelatin prints. These 'TinTones' as Russ would call them were to become the trademark of his work. They were published in popular fashion and lifestyle magazines and brought him international recognition among peers in the art world. Michael Russ “Prussian Blue” TinTone photo exhibition at the Los Angeles China Club was the basis for the artistic collaboration with Tom Waits who commissioned Russ for the cover photograph for the album "Swordfishtrombones".
Early years – life and work in the 1960s and 70s.
Russ moved from Berlin, Germany to the US in 1958 after his father's death to rejoin his mother. They resided in Denver, Colorado. While still in high school he took ballet (Lillian Cushing School of Ballet) and acting lessons and performed locally. On his 17th birthday he enlisted in the US army and spent 2.1/2 years stationed in Bamberg, Germany. After his discharge he moved to New York City in 1965 where he attended Renate Mannhardt acting workshop and began taking pictures of his fellow acting students. Encouraged by Wilhelmina Cooper of "Wilhelmina Models" to pursue a career in fashion photography she sent him models on Go-Sees for test shoots and thus helped him to make his entry into fashion photography.
In 1970 he moved into his own studio off Union Square, right around the corner from Andy Warhol and "The Factory" , frequenting "Max's Kansas City", a favorite hang out for Warhol and his friends as well as upcoming musical legends like David Bowie, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix or The Velvet Underground.
By the early seventies Russ' work had been published with major fashion and lifestyle magazines like "Mens Wear", "Esquire", "GQ", "True Magazine" and contributed erotic fantasy images to three "Playboy Press" books: "Love Games", "Sexy Ladies" and "Ecstasy".
Developing a unique photographic approach.
In 1976 Michael Russ moved to Paris and continued with artistically manipulating his silver gelatin prints. Adding hand coloring and masking and solarization to his black and white, or chemically toned images. Applying these photographic techniques lends a painterly aspect to the grainy black and white images as though they come off the silver screen. Thus displaying a very personal distinctive style, characteristic for his work.
By Russ` own accord, his grasp of paintings developed early on through the work of German expressionists like Ludwig Kirchner, Max Beckmann and Otto Dix. In his treatment of color, he especially admired Marc Chagall. His work was published in major fashion, lifestyle and avant-garde magazines, "GUNNARS", "Mode International", "Mode Avant Guarde", "PHOTO Magazine", "Zoom"(photography magazine), as well as German "Playboy (magazine)", "Photo Reporter" and cover art to "IL Magazine". He also contributed sequential 'sujets de chambre' to Vogue magazine
His erotic postcard edition "The Compagnie" became part of the permanent collection of the Musée des arts décoratifs de Paris, an annex to the Louvre museum.
The post productive darkroom work was part to the graphic picture sequence. He incorporated the perforation of 35mm film and visual soundtracks to resemble snippets of motion picture film. Results of these experiments were published as a sequence in "Vogue Hommes" under the title ”L' initiative au feminine” using fashion as accessories. A Portfolio 'Michael Russ ou la beaute du grain' was published in Vogue Hommes in November 1980. He was also the artistic consultant to François Mimet's feature film "Mme. Claude II" (US Title "Intimate Moments"), "Accord Productions" 1981.
Later years - from the 80s to the present.
In 1981 Michael relocated to Los Angeles. There he photographed actors and celebrities for the L.A. Times and L.A. Weekly, but mainly focused on exhibiting his TinTones in large format. His “Prussian Blue” exhibition at the original China Club in 1983 caught the attention of Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan, Tom's wife. Waits commissioned Russ to create the cover of his new Island Label record "Swordfishtrombones" with a photograph in the ‘TinTone’ style, featuring himself, Lee Kolima, the strong man and "Angelo Rossitto" (The mayor of Hollywood).
Angelo also premiered in Tod Browning's 1932 classic 'Freaks' which "inspired the album's iconic mutant cover art by Michael A. Russ".
Russ then became associate director and choreographer on the music video to the song "In the Neighborhood" from that album for MTV, closely working with director Haskell Wexler.
He kept refining his ‘TinTone’ techniques by creating images using various materials in limited editions and he has exhibited in the US, Europe and Asia.
“Wear magazine” commissioned him for a showcase entitled 'Nella villa di Tamara', in the ‘TinTone’ style of the Canadian theater production TAMARA which had a ten-year run at the American Legion.
1986 -1995 Russ returned to Germany and focused on fine art photographic work, perfecting his
‘TinTone’ variations. These were published as portfolios and on the covers of renowned trade and photographic magazines: "Photo Technik International", "Color Foto", "Playgirl", "ZOOM", "NewMag", "Das Magazin".
In 1992 he worked on a special Fine Art sequence on Robert Wilson's 'The Black Rider' at the Thalia Theater (Hamburg).
In 1995 he resettled in Los Angeles where he was showcased in Larry Flynt's experimental “RAGE Magazine”, Larry Flynt Publications (LFP), featuring a 12-foot python act at the Opium Den. Eroticism, beauty and the allure of the female body is the subject matter of much of Michael Russ` photography. Despite working for the fashion industry and glamour magazines, Russ photography preserved a raw and edgy aspect and a distinct artistic quality far from glossy surfaces and the idea of a “perfect picture”.
He directed Samantha Fox' comeback video "The reason is you" for "Basilea Film" Zurich which was shown on music TV channels MTV and VIVA.
In Santa Fe (New Mexico) where he settled from 1998-2000 Russ exhibited large format TinTone Iris Gicle prints at the Paramount and at Fullers Lodge in Los Alamos.
"Basler Magazin" (Switzerland) published a portfolio (Prussian Blue).
In 2001 Russ returned to Berlin and has since been commuting between the continents (Berlin, New York, Los Angeles), working and exhibiting internationally.
"Playboy" magazine (Germany) and "Fine Art Photo" magazine published showcases and biographical portraits.
In 2007 Russ first introduced and exhibited limited editions of large scale Silver/Industrial TinTones in Berlin for which he received critical acclaim. A critic of major German newspaper "Die Welt", compared his erotic photography to the work of Helmut Newton(having shared some of his photographic models in the late 1970s) and highlighted his creative use of color and layering techniques in his TinTones. In 2012 he had an exhibition with his TinTones in Seoul, Republic of Korea
In 2013 Russ' large scale TinTone Industrials were featured at the "Berlin Fotofestival The Browse".

Battle of Motovilivka

The Battle of Motovilivka was a military engagement fought between forces of the Ukrainian State and the Directorate of Ukraine. The battle took place on 18 November 1918 during the Ukrainian Civil War, and resulted in a major victory for the Directorate. The battle resulted in the eventual collapse of the Ukrainian State in December 1918.
Background.
Following the Russian Revolution and the breakup of the Russian Empire, an extended period of social and political unrest erupted in the former Russian Ukraine. With the First World War raging in Europe, the Central Power member nations of Germany and Austria Hungary sought to take advantage of the civil discord in the former Russian Empire by gaining control of the Ukraine's reserves of wheat. A joint German-Austrian army invaded the Ukraine in February 1918, defeated a disorganized force of Bolshevik soldiers and militia units, and forced the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Among other conditions, the treaty placed the Ukraine in Germany's political and economic orbit. The acting government of the Ukraine, the Ukrainian People's Republic, acquiesced to the German terms, though a number of small militant groups actively resisted the Germans. However, none of the various militant groups operating against the Germans were capable of effectively holding territory in the face of the overwhelmingly superior German army.
On 29 April 1918 a former General of the Imperial Russian Army, Pavlo Skoropadskyi, orchestrated a coup that succeeded in dissolving the Central Council of the republic and enthroning himself as the Hetman of the new Ukrainian State. The new government was supported by Germany, which desperately needed Ukraine's food supplies and sought to create a postwar buffer state between Germany and any nation-states that would arise in Russia. In addition to tying the new Ukrainian monarchy to the German Empire, Skoropadskyi also repealed a number of the Central Council's socialist policies, actions which in turn caused a number of pro-Bolshevik factions to revolt against the government. These factions gained momentum when the First World War came to an end on 11 November 1918, depriving the Ukrainian State of the majority of Germany's support. On 13 November a number of rebel factions formed the Directorate of Ukraine (also referred to as the Ukrainian National Union) to oppose the weakened Skoropadskyi government. The Directorate formed an army and moved against Kiev.
The majority of the Directorate's forces were peasant militia from pro-Bolshevik or anti-Hetman Green armies. These militias were supplemented by the Sich Riflemen, a unit of professional Ukrainian soldiers that had formerly been disarmed and disbanded by the Skoropadskyi regime. The forces of the Ukrainian State were made up of former Russian troops, anti-Bolshevik militia, and a small contingent of German military advisers.
Battle.
On 15 November 1918 advance forces of the Directorate's army began to move towards Kiev from the southwest. To counter this action, a force of 700 Hetman soldiers moved to intercept the Directorate forces near the town of Vasylkiv. The Hetman forces deployed themselves near a train station at Motovilivka. Intelligence of the Hetman deployment at Motovilivka made its way to forward elements of the Sich Riflemen under the command of Captain Fyodor Chernik. In response, Chernik launched an immediate attack against the Hetman forces, hoping to punch through their defenses and take Vasylkiv. His detachment of 300 men attacked the left, right, and center of the Hetman force early on the morning of 18 November. The Hetman army counterattacked, pinning down the Directorate army's left flank. The Directorate forces held, but sustained several dozen casualties, including Chernik. On the Directorate's right flank, a force of 50 Sich Riflemen took cover in a wooded area from which they repelled several attacks by a large force of several hundred Hetman soldiers. In addition, both sides utilized armored trains during the battle to provide fire support for their respective forces. By midday the Hetman army's attack had begun to weaken, and Directorate reinforcements began to arrive on the field. Soon the Directorate left was able to outflank the Hetman right flank, sending the army into a retreat. The Hetman army counterattacked with their reserve forces and with an armored train, but one of the Directorate's armored trains landed an artillery shot on the Hetman train, forcing it to withdraw. The Hetman counterattack failed, and by 3:00 PM the Directorate forces held the field.
Casualties.
The Directorate forces suffered 17 killed and several dozen wounded in the battle, while the Hetman forces sustained 700 casualties.
Aftermath.
Following their victory at Motovilivka, the Directorate forces advanced on and captured Vasylkiv. The Hetman force retreated to Darnytsia. Over the next several weeks the Directorate forces moved closer to Kiev, and on 14 December Skoropadskyi fled to Berlin. This flight marked the end of the Ukrainian State.

Moilin Jean Ah-Chuen

Sir Jean Etienne Moilin Ah-Chuen ("Chinese": 朱梅麟; 1911-1991) was a Sino-Mauritian politician and businessman from Mauritius. He was First Chinese Cabinet Minister from 1967 to 1976 and First Chinese Member, Legislative Council in 1949. He was decorated by Pope John Paul II and knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.

Family background and history.
His father, Chu Wei Chuen, arrived in Mauritius from Meizhou, Guangdong, China in 1887. In the late 19th century during the Qing dynasty, many Hakka Chinese went abroad in search of a better livelihood. He was 14 years old. His dream was simple - start a business, make a fortune and return home. He started a grocery store in the vicinity of one of the sugar cane factories. By the time he died, he was the owner of three shops in the country.
Jean Moilin was the second son of Chu Wei Chuen. He learned how to manage the family's shop from his father.
Jean was an active person, he gave his time to the community and worked with several associations. He was the co-founder of the Chinese Daily News, a Chinese newspaper outlet in Mauritius.
Career.
In 1931, at the age of twenty, Jean set up his own convenience shop in Port-Louis at 18 Queen Street. The store was called ABC, which stands for 'Au Bazar Central' (At the Central Market) because it was situated opposite the central market. He was later joined by his sons in the business. He took over the small business and expanded it into a highly diversified company now includes departments dedicated to car imports, banking, financial and insurance services, foods production and distribution, and shipping and freight.
In 2017, ABC Group was named as one of the leading business organizations in Mauritius by Forbes Magazine with his son was named as one of the multi-millionaire businessmen in Mauritius.
Moilin Jean Ah-Chuen became one of the most successful entrepreneurs in Mauritius. He was also one of the founding members of the Mauritius Union Assurance in 1948, a company specialising in insurance, pensions and investments that is listed on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius under the symbol MUA. The group has operations in several countries across East Africa.
Politics.
At the age of 31, he became the youngest president of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. This position marked the start of his political career. Under his charge, the chamber played an important role in providing food to the Chinese community in Mauritius during World War II when Japanese warships and submarines disrupted the food supply to the island nation.
As an influencer in the community, he was asked in 1948 by the British Colonial Government to sit as a member of the Legislative Assembly as a representative of the Chinese community.
At the March 1959 general elections he was defeated by Sheik Y. Ramjan in Constituency No.5 Port Louis Maritime. He was elected at the October 1963 elections in Constituency No.5. At the August 1967 elections he was a candidate of the PMSD in Constituency No.3 Port Louis Maritime &amp; East, and along with Dawood Patel and Oozeerally of the PMSD Ah Cheun was elected to the Legislative Council. However at the December 1976 elections Ah Cheun was not elected when he stood as candidate of the Labour-CAM coalition in Constituency No.1 GRNW and Port Louis West. He served as Minister of Local Government after Mauritius became independent in 1968 when Seewoosagur Ramgoolam was the prime minister.
The Ministry of Local Government is responsible for local government matters in Mauritius and Jean Ah-Chuen played a key role in the industrialisation of the country after independence. He was instrumental in establishing the Mauritius free-trade zone. Through his connections, the first investors from Taiwan and Hong Kong came to Mauritius to set up textiles operations which helped to reduce unemployment in the country.
In 1980, Moilin Jean Ah-Chuen was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.
Legacy.
He died in October 1991, and left a legacy to his 11 children.
In 1992, his daughter, Marie Madeleine Lee, became the first Mauritian ambassador to China.
In honor of his contribution to the country, Sir Jean Moilin's portrait was printed on the 25-rupee banknotes in Mauritius in 1998.
In 2007, his children decided to transform the family's old residence in Rose-Hill into a museum and memorial center. The museum opened to the public two years later in 2009.
His biography was written by Lilianne Berthelot, a Mauritian author, and was published in 2008.
In 2011, the Mauritius Post also issued a postage stamp to commemorate his birth centenary.

Auspicious (1799 ship)

Auspicious was launched at Newcastle in 1799 and was wrecked at Heneaga on 16 August 1801. She was part of a convoy sailing from Jamaica to England when strong, unsuspected currents drove her, five other merchantman, and one of their escorts, the frigate on to the shore. 
"Auspicious" entered "Lloyd's Register" in 1799 with Stranach, master, J. Lyall, owner, and trade London transport. In 1801 "Auspicious" was under the command of J. Proctor and sailing to Jamaica, that is, as a West Indiaman.
Loss.
In July 1801 "Auspicious" was part of a convoy sailing back from the West Indies to England. The convoy assembled off Port Antonio and got under way on 27 July. The escorts consisted of , , the sloop "Bonetta", and the schooners (or "Muskito"), and "Sting".
On 8 August the convoy was off Môle-Saint-Nicolas and set off for the Caicos Passage. Two days later they sighted Great Inagua. That night a strong current was noted on "Lowestoffe". Despite efforts to steer her taking the current into account and dropping her anchors to keep her from grounding, she struck. Her crew cut away masts, threw guns overboard, but the inflow of water overwhelmed the pumps. Her crew took to her boats and landed on the shore. Daybreak revealed that "Lowestoffe" had been wrecked on Heneaga, and that several merchantmen too had been wrecked. Five men on "Lowestoffe" were lost when a boat capsized in the surf.
None of the merchantmen suffered any fatalities. The merchantmen that were wrecked were:
In the late afternoon of 11 August "Acasta" left "Bonetta" and three of her own boats to help the wrecked vessels and then took command of the convoy. "Bonetta" took the survivors back to Jamaica.
The subsequent court-martial at Port Royal on 3 September ruled that a sudden change in the current after dark had caused the loss. The board acknowledged that Captain Pamplin of "Lowestoffe" had sailed in a judicious manner and exonerated him and his officers from blame both for the loss of "Lowestoffe" and the vessels in convoy.

Jadis (The Walking Dead)

Jadis (also known as Anne) is a fictional character from the horror drama television series "The Walking Dead" and "", which air on AMC in the United States and are based on the comic book series of the same name. She is portrayed by Pollyanna McIntosh. Anne is an original character in the television series and has no counterpart in the comics.
Appearances.
Personality.
Jadis is initially introduced as the oddly-spoken and enigmatic leader of the Scavengers. She is calm and collected, but also very cunning and sly. Though she originally only speaks in contrived broken English (and complains that others talk too much), she reverts to full sentences following the murders of the Scavengers, by Simon and members of the Saviors. Later, as Anne, she is a fully accepted member of the Alexandria community, beginning in season 9, and starts a relationship with Fr. Gabriel Stokes, which does not last the full run of the season. She keeps secret details of her connection with a mysterious organization still flying helicopters many years into the apocalypse and eventually leaves to rejoin them, taking a critically injured Rick Grimes with her by helicopter. Jadis is not seen again until The Walking Dead: World Beyond Season 2 leaving her current personality and status a mystery.
Season 7.
In the mid-season premiere "Rock in the Road", Jadis's group kidnapped Gabriel and then ambushed Rick's team as they searched for him. In the episode "New Best Friends", when asked by Rick to join forces to defeat the Saviors, Jadis is reluctant but takes it into consideration after being told that they could gain more supplies. Jadis tells Rick he needs to prove his worth and she pushes him down a trash heap into a pit of trash and metal. After watching Rick kill a heavily armored walker, she tells him that she and her people will help him, but that they need a lot of guns. In the episode "Say Yes", when Rick's group delivers 63 guns to her, she tells him that it is not enough, claiming they need nearly twice as many guns. Rick and Jadis renegotiate and agree that he will keep 20 of the guns while he searches for more. He finds the needed guns at Oceanside in the episode "Something They Need", seemingly clinching the Scavengers' support. In the season finale "The First Day of the Rest of Your Life", on the day of the battle, she crudely propositions Rick upon arrival at Alexandria. Together, the Scavengers and the Alexandrians wire up bombs at the gates ready for the enemy. When the explosion fails as Negan and his men wait by the gates, Jadis pulls a gun on Rick and the Scavengers follow suit with the rest of the Alexandrians. She reveals that she told Negan of Rick's plan and was offered a "better deal" by the Saviors. When the Saviors get distracted by the re-animated Sasha, Rick attempts to make another deal with her, but Jadis refuses and shoots him in the abdomen; she pushes him off the platform. During the battle, she flees with her group through smoke bombs.
Season 8.
In the episode "The King, the Widow, and Rick", after the war between the Saviors and the banded survivors has begun, Rick again attempts to get Jadis on his side. She imprisons him in a shipping container. In the episode "Time for After", Jadis releases him to fight with another armed walker. He decapitates the walker and disarms her men, giving her new terms which she appears to accept. In the mid-season finale "How It's Gotta Be", Rick is abandoned by Jadis and her Scavengers when they discover the aftermath of Daryl's attack on the Sanctuary and are fired on by Savior soldiers.
In the episode "The Lost and the Plunderers", Simon, not pleased with Negan's approach and knowing the Hilltop has the rest of his 38 men in captivity, goes to the Scavengers' junkyard and accuses Jadis of going back on their deal with the Saviors, but gives her Negan's offer of returning to the original terms of their deal and giving over all their guns. Jadis agrees, but Simon does not believe Jadis is showing enough remorse and kills her two lieutenants, Tamiel and Brion, in cold blood. She punches him, causing Simon to then order his men to kill the rest of the Scavengers. By the time Rick and Michonne arrive at the junkyard, all of the Scavengers but Jadis have reanimated. They find Jadis alone, having dropped her aloof nature. She explains that she had been an artist before the outbreak, having used the junkyard for materials, but afterwards, she and the Scavengers saw the junkyard as a way to keep themselves isolated from the rest of the world while using the entire yard as their canvas.
Rick, tired of Jadis' double-crosses, decides to abandon her as he and Michonne escape. Jadis lures the remaining walkers into an industrial shredder to protect herself, crying to herself as she watches her former friends be destroyed. In the episode "The Key", Jadis captures Negan at gunpoint. In the episode "Still Gotta Mean Something", in flashback, Jadis plays dead to save herself from the massacre of the Scavengers by Simon and the Saviors. In the present, she takes time to compose herself before collecting a captive Negan and carrying his modified baseball bat, "Lucille", and a suitcase. Negan tries to apologize for what happened to her people, recognizing that Simon had went against his orders in wiping out the Scavengers, but Jadis is steadfast and still threatens to kill him. While she is out of sight, he is able to access her suitcase, containing a gun and pictures from her past, convincing her to talk lest he destroy them with a flare. He reveals that he named his bat after his late wife, Lucille, and, like Jadis' pictures, his bat is the last thing he has to remember his previous life. Jadis suddenly rushes him, more to get at the flare, but it is knocked out of their hands into a puddle, and extinguishes. She runs off to get another flare as a helicopter hovers briefly overhead before disappearing, too late to see Jadis' second flare. Jadis breaks down into tears. Jadis lets Negan go; he offers her to come with him and follow a new path, but she refuses. In the season finale "Wrath", Jadis tells Morgan that he can call her "Anne". Morgan comes to the junkyard and tells her she can go anywhere she wants now that Negan has been defeated, so she leaves, but he stays in her place.
Season 9.
In the season premiere "A New Beginning," Anne, now a fully accepted member of the Alexandria community, joins a supply run into Washington, D.C. Having visited the Smithsonian Museum once with her class when she was still a teacher, Anne is able to lead the group to a cache of supplies in the basement of the museum. On their return, they find the bridge to Hilltop is out, and Rick develops a plan to rebuild it. In the episode "The Bridge", Anne helps with this reconstruction, during which she and Father Gabriel start to discover feelings for each other. However, while on watch one night, she spots a helicopter flying overhead. In the episode "Warning Signs", the next day she departs from the construction camp, unaware Gabriel is following her. Back at the scrapyard, she recovers a walkie-talkie and talks to an unidentified man on the other end. The man tells her she missed her pickup and they will only pick her up if she brings an "A" with her. Anne discovers Gabriel and subdues him. In the episode "The Obliged", she prepares to feed Gabriel to a walker but cannot come to do it, but she still tells the man on the other end of the walkie-talkie that she has his "A". Gabriel recognizes that Anne has been engaging in human trafficking, but she lets him go while she flees to meet with the helicopter. In the episode "What Comes After", she races to the meeting point, insisting to the man she still has her "A". While waiting at the site, she witnesses the smoke set up by Rick's destruction of the bridge, and among the various walker bodies that float down river, she finds a heavily-wounded Rick washed ashore. She reports to the landing helicopter that she has a "B" and he needs their help. Anne and Rick are loaded on the helicopter and taken away.
Season 2.
Jadis is not seen again until The Walking Dead: World Beyond Season 2.
In the trailer for The Walking Dead: World Beyond Season 2, Jadis appears dressed in Civic Republic Military attire saying: "I know that the Civic Republic is the last light of the world. My purpose is to create a new era on this planet,"
Development and Reception.
Pollyanna McIntosh appears as Jadis in what was initially just a recurring role in 3 episodes of "The Walking Dead"'s seventh season. However, for the eighth season of the show she was promoted to the main cast.
As Jadis.
Ron Hagan for "Den of Geek!" in his review of season 7 episode "Something They Need" said, "Jadis and the garbage men (best band name ever) are a prime example of the writers having a little fun with the show, creating a new faction that is both wholly original and fits in with the overall mythology of the show." Kevin Fitzpatrick of "Screen Crush" reviewed the season finale "The First Day of the Rest of Your Life" and said that "there's a notable dichotomy between treating that reveal [of Sasha's death] as a moment of surprise, and having Jadis and the junkyard folks' betrayal actually catch viewers off-guard. The outbreak of war itself isn't any major shock, nor is the lack of any notable casualties, but a non-comic element like Jadis felt like the one true wild card in an otherwise predictable showdown." He also commented that "as much as Jadis' interaction with Negan reiterates the amusing distinction* her group provides, the 'Heapsters' heel-turn does mean we spent two or three episodes building these characters up as allies, only to have them turn with little explanation, and essentially guarantee their role as enemies next season" and that "Jadis' proposition to 'lay with' Rick offered another wonderful moment of weirdness for this oddly monosyllabic group, but why even bother, given what she knew of how the exchange would go down?" Blair Marnell of CraveOnline commented on how "Jadis and her Scavengers had betrayed Rick's group to the Saviors. Really? You mean it wasn’t a good idea to hunt down guns and give them to these cartoon psychos that they barely knew? There are times when the TV show improves upon the comic book’s storyline, but this was not one of those occasions. From the start, the Scavengers have felt out of place on this series, and it would have been refreshing to see all of them end up as tiger food." Marnell also said that "At least Jadis had a very funny moment in which she propositioned Rick right in front of Michonne and basically asked if Michonne had a problem with that. The facial expressions of Danai Gurira and Andrew Lincoln were really priceless. That take on Jadis could have had more potential, if all of her followers didn't also have the same strange way of speaking. There was simply nothing more to Jadis or the Scavengers other than their bizarre trash motif." Stuart Jeffries of "The Guardian" called her hairstyle "the fringe that's an unwitting homage to King Henry V of England c1415" and said that "Jadis and her gang turned their guns on the Alexandrians. Even Michonne found herself in the cross hairs of a former ally on the roof. Why did it have to be this way, Jadis, why? 'I got a better deal,' quoth she. Just hope, for her sake, the deal she struck with Negan includes a few hours at a top salon, if you catch my drift." Elise Nakhnikian of "Slant Magazine" was critical that "the mystery isn't so much why Jadis betrayed Rick as why he ever trusted her in the first place. She clearly never gave a damn about his safety or well-being, tossing him off her trash heap to fight with the armored walker on their first meeting, and she was a mercurial and unreasonable trading partner, insisting that Rick's people go back for more guns after they'd risked so much to bring her the first batch. Yet he keeps trying to negotiate with her even after she shoots him, offering to strike a new deal until she casually pushes him off yet another high platform, annoyed that he failed to obey her command to kneel down."
Zack Handlen of "The A.V. Club" reviewed the season eight episode "Time for After" and said: "After capitulating to Rick because he beat up some people, Jadis tries negotiating. She wants to sculpt him in the nude. He refuses, and while I get that posing naked in a garbage dump for strangers isn’t everybody’s idea of a good time, I’m a little disappointed." Steve Ford of "TV Fanatic" reviewed the same episode, saying "It was interesting how Jadis came around after having her face inches away from that walker head's gnawing teeth. Perhaps she admires Rick's tenacity. However, I wouldn't put it past Jadis to turn on Rick yet again, but I think she'll follow Rick at least for the time being. "
As Anne.
The season 9 episode "What Comes After" marked the last appearance of both Andrew Lincoln (Rick Grimes) as well as Pollyanna McIntosh (Jadis/Anne). Both actors have been confirmed to take a role in a series of three AMC Original Films to continue Rick's story, with production on the first to initially start in 2019. Lincoln had been working with Scott Gimple, the former showrunner and now current content manager for all of AMC's "The Walking Dead" properties, about how Rick's story could continue for some time. They had established early on that it needed to involve Jadis and the helicopter, and established these elements in earlier seasons to prepare for this point.
Civil Republic Military.
On the role in The Walking Dead: World Beyond, AMC Network's Scott Gimple confirmed in a press release: "In our story, years have passed—we'll get hints of what happened with that fateful helicopter ride and learn Jadis has new allies and alliances; she is a big part of connecting the CRM and Three Circles mythology that's seen throughout all three series. We can't wait to share it all with fans of the TWDU."
Writing about the return, Alec Bojalad for Den of Geek said that Jadis has come a long way since, "First introduced as a quite literal garbage person in The Walking Dead season 7, Jadis received the honor of being the character that brought Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) to safety so that he could live another day…and get his own spinoff movie franchise. Now the character is on to big things once again." Bojalad speculated that the new role could be setting up the movie spin-off.
McIntosh said of her return: "I love the character of Jadis, and I love this world, so getting to inhabit her again in collaboration with the talented team at The Walking Dead: World Beyond in beautiful Richmond, Virginia was a joy."
Walking Dead Chief Content Officer Scott Gimple has said that McIntosh as Jadis/Anne is planned to appear in the upcoming movie spin-offs, telling the story of what happened after Rick and Jadis departed in a helicopter.

M.T. Usman

Mohammed Tukur Usman (1932 - 2009) was a Nigerian government official who was permanent secretary of the Federal Ministry of Works during the Murtala Mohamed and Obasanjo administration from 1975 to 1979. 
He was a cousin of the Yaraduas.
Life.
Usman was born in Katsina where he spent most of his childhood. He finished his secondary education from Barewa College Zaria, and was in the graduation class that became the first to take General Certificate of Education examination at Barewa. After taking the exam, unlike his peers who went straight to work for the native Authorities, Usman decided to join the colonial civil service as a civil engineer. The first process of joining the service began with him taking a civil service exam in 1949, he was then accepted to study civil engineering. Between 1950 and 1953, he was in training at the Yaba polytechnic and spent other months as an apprentice under public works engineers. In 1954, he obtained a scholarship from the Northern regional government to study civil engineering at University of Sussex. After learning civil engineering skills abroad, he returned to Nigeria; Usman's first job was with the regional Ministry of Works as one of the four pioneer engineers from the region. He later was posted on secondment for three years to the Nigerian Ports Authority in Lagos and Port Harcourt. In 1968, he joined the Federal Ministry of Works
Usman rose through the ranks within the federal civil service, beginning in 1968, when he became the Chief Engineer of the Federal Ministry of Works. In 1971, he was appointed director of works and became the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Works in 1975.
Usman was Permanent Secretary when the exclusive list of roads maintained by the government increased from 11,000 km to 27,000 km. Usman recognized that there is a poor attitude towards road and building maintenance by the government, placing some blame on over protection of civil servants and shoddy work by companies lacking necessary manpower. His tenure saw the completion of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, the Benin-Shagamu dual carriageway and the A2 road, linking Warri-Benin-Okene-Abuja-Kaduna.

Trump (dog)

Trump (c. 1730 – c. 1745) was a pug owned by English painter William Hogarth. The artist included the dog in several works, including his 1745 self-portrait "Painter and his Pug", held by the Tate Gallery. In the words of the Tate's display caption, "Hogarth's pug dog, Trump, serves as an emblem of the artist's own pugnacious character."
History.
Hogarth owned several different pugs through his life. For example, in December 1730, he placed an advertisement offering a half guinea reward for the return of a dog named "Pugg".
Pugs appear in several of Hogarth's paintings. An early example is his 1730 group portrait of "The Wollaston Family", on loan to the New Walk Museum in Leicester since 1943. In the fifth scene of Hogarth's 1732–1734 series "A Rake's Progress", a scene known as "Married To An Old Maid" which is held by Sir John Soane's Museum, a pug appears to be marrying a one-eyed dog, mirroring the wedding scene depicted behind in which the spendthrift Tom Rakewell is marrying a rich old maid.
Trump is believed to be the puppy in the Hogarth's 1730 group portrait "The Fountaine Family", held by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, whose sitters include Andrew Fountaine. The adult pug in the 1738 "The Strode Family", held by the Tate Gallery, may also be Trump, although some sources indicate that this pug belongs to one of the subjects, Colonel Strode.
Louis-François Roubiliac sculpted Trump in terracotta, c. 1741, to accompany a terracotta bust of Hogarth. The reclining terracotta figure of Trump was reproduced in Chelsea porcelain in the late 1740s. Plaster casts were sold with Hogarth's possessions after his death in 1762. The Staffordshire potter Josiah Wedgwood made a version in his Black Basalt ware, using a cast bought in 1774 from the London plaster shop of Richard Parker. The original terracotta sculpture was inherited by Hogarth's widow and retained until her death in 1790. It was recorded in 1799 an engraving by Samuel Ireland, but the original is now lost.
Trump was approaching old age when he was included in Hogarth's 1745 painting "The Painter and his Pug", sitting next to a self-portrait of the artist, along with an easel bearing Hogarth's symbolic line of beauty and works by Shakespeare, Swift, and Milton. (Hogarth had begun the work around 1735, but it originally appeared somewhat different, with Hogarth more formally dressed and wearing a wig, and without Trump.") According to Hogarth's biographer Ronald Paulson the painting contains many visual puns, with the dog alluding to Hogarth's own pugnaciousnesss; the allegorical fidelity of the dog to its master paralleling Hogarth's artistic fidelity of presentation; and Hogarth's portrait being (literally) supported by the English literary canon.
Hogarth included Trump in the 1746 portrait of "Captain Lord George Graham in his Cabin", at the National Maritime Museum, along with Lord George Graham's own dog, which is sitting at the captain's feet and apparently joining in the singing. Trump sits on his haunches on a chair to the right of the painting, wearing Graham's wig, apparently reading from a sheet of music resting against a wine glass.
Hogarth was disparagingly nicknamed the "Painter Pugg", but Hogarth continued to use the dog as his trademark in a satirical 1763 engraving "The Bruiser", based on his 1745 self-portrait with Trump. "The Bruiser" (a copy of which is held by the United States' National Gallery of Art) replaces Hogarth's portrait with the satirist Charles Churchill, lampooned as a drunken bear, while the dog urinates on a copy of the "Epistle" published by Churchill in support of John Wilkes, which criticised Hogarth.
Hogarth's strong identification with his dog led Paul Sandby to caricature Hogarth as a pug in his 1753 engraving "Puggs Graces".
In 2001, a statue of Hogarth with Trump, made by Jim Mathieson, was unveiled by Ian Hislop and David Hockney on the Chiswick High Road, close to Hogarth's House, the artist's residence from 1749 until his death in 1764.

John Daly (academic)

John Alfred Daly OAM (7 August 1936 – 11 March 2018) was an Australian academic physical educator, sports historian and Australian Olympic athletics coach.
Academic career.
Daly was a graduate of the University of Adelaide. He was appointed to Adelaide Teachers College in 1961 after three years teaching at Lefevre Boys Technical High School. The University of Adelaide physical education diploma course was transferred to the College in 1968 and Daly designed and headed a four-year degree course. Daly took leave to complete a master's degree and PhD in history and sociology of sport at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Daly was a Principal Lecturer and Head of Department at the Adelaide College of the Arts and Education, which later became part of the University of South Australia, for 20 years. He retired from academic life in 1996. After his retirement, he returned to his love of drawing and painting and exhibited his works of art.
Coaching career.
Before moving into coaching, Daly was a member of the Adelaide Harriers Club where he competed in sprint events.
Daly was a prominent Australian athletics coach and official. Major athletics appointments included:
He was Glynis Nunn's coach when she won the Women's heptathlon at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.
In 1974, Daly established the Australian Track and Field Coaches Association.
In 1978, Daly was a founding member of the Australian Coaching Council. From 1979 to 1981, he was the chairman of the Council's Technical Committee which introduced a national coaching accreditation scheme based on Canada's model.
Administration.
In 1976, after Australia's poor performance at the Montreal Olympics, Daly wrote an open letter in "The Australian" titled "Courageous Amateurs Must Fail". This controversial letter argued that the Australian sports system was out of date and it was not the athletes and coaches' fault for poor results in Montreal.
He was a member of the Australian Government's Sport Advisory Council from 1979 to 1984. In 1981, he was appointed as an inaugural member of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) Board and held this position until 1985. In 1991, he authored the book "Quest for Excellence: the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra" which detailed the first ten years of the AIS.
He married athlete Judy Tapfield, a South Australian state, national and international Masters champion and a member of Adelaide Harriers, in 1976. Judy Daly died on 1 November 2017.
John died on 11 March 2018, aged 81, in Hahndorf, South Australia.

Mark Twain Hotel (Chicago)

The Mark Twain Hotel is a historic residential hotel located at 111 W. Division Street in the Near North Side community area of Chicago, Illinois. Built in 1930 by developer Fred Becklenberg, the hotel was one of several residential hotels built to house the influx of labor to Chicago in the late 1920s. Most of the hotel's residents were permanent; according to 1940 census records, the majority had been at the hotel for over five years. Architect Harry Glube designed the hotel in the Art Deco style, a departure from the revival styles normally used for residential hotels. The brick building features extensive terra cotta detailing, including an elaborate cornice and stringcourse above and below the fourth floor.
The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 8, 2017.
The building was renovated starting in 2018 and celebrated a grand re-opening in 2020. During the renovation it was converted to 148 typical but affordable rental studio apartments by NHP Foundation.

Congress of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Nurses and Midwives

The Congress of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Nurses and Midwives (CATSINaM) is the peak national body that represents, advocates for and supports Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nurses and midwives in Australia. The organisation is located in Canberra, in the ACT.
Objectives.
CATSINaM advocates for improved health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. CATSINaM seeks to increase the number of practising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nurses and midwives through improved recruitment and retention, and its annual professional development conference contributes to this strategy. The number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nurses and midwives grew from 2,246 or 0.79% of the Australian nursing and midwifery workforce in 2011 to 3,201 in 2016, or 1.02% of the nursing and midwifery workforce.
CATSINaM develops and promotes strategies to ensure the cultural safety of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients and health professionals, particularly for CATSINaM members. CATSINaM advocates for a national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nursing and midwifery workforce strategy, cultural safety to be embedded into health practitioner legislation, and the development of a “health barometer” to measure race relations and cultural safety within the health system. In June 2017, CATSINaM secured a three-year funding agreement with the Australian Government Department of Health for the establishment of a ‘Leaders in Indigenous Nursing and Midwifery Education Network’ or LINMEN.
CATSINaM provides policy advice to governments and a range of agencies, including universities, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia and the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, and works collaboratively with many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations. In 2016 CATSINaM began coordinating the establishment of an International Alliance of First Nations Nurses and Midwives. Alliance Members include: Australia, New Zealand, Hawai`i and Canada, with some other Pacific Island nations also 
included through the Pacific Nursing Section of the New Zealand Nurses Organisation.
History.
CATSIN was founded in 1997 to formally represent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nurses and midwives. A grant from the Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (OATSIH) to the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation provided for the first national meeting of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nurses in August 1997. Held in Sydney, the three-day meeting developed a series of recommendations for strategies and initiatives to advance the recruitment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into nursing. In 1998, CATSIN was incorporated and until July 2012, led by its founding Executive 
Director, Dr Sally Goold OAM, a Wiradjuri woman. In 2016, CATSINaM established two new award categories to formally honour the outstanding achievements of members, and Sally Goold was the first inductee into the CATSINaM ‘Hall of Fame’.
Since 2013, CATSINaM was led by CEO Janine Mohamed who stood down, New CEO Melaine Robinson stepped in February 2019, Melaine has cultural connections to the Gidja and Ngarinyin people of the Kimberley in Western Australia, is passionate about supporting young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Having grown up on Gibb River Station on Ngallagunda community before moving to Derby as a young girl, she has a connection with the particular health challenges faced by rural and remote communities. Melanie has a deep personal understanding of the impacts of colonisation, including having family members affected by Stolen Generations policies. Through her professional and own family’s experiences, Melanie has seen many examples of institutional and interpersonal racism, contributing to poor health outcomes and inequitable access to healthcare
Structure.
CATSINaM is a company limited by guarantee and operates within the Corporations Act 2001 (Commonwealth) as well as the CATSINaM 
Constitution registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). CATSINaM has an eight-member Aboriginal and or Torres Strait Islander Board of Directors who represent each state and territory, and must be currently registered as a nurse or midwife.

Rain or Shine (Houston Person album)

Rain or Shine is an album by saxophonist Houston Person which was recorded in 2017 and released on the HighNote label.
Reception.
On All About Jazz, Jack Bowers noted "Tenor saxophonist Houston Person, now in his eightieth decade, has made no concessions to Father Time, choosing instead to use his many years in the jazz trenches to forge a style all his own, bathed in blues and soul but never turning a deaf ear to the allure of a seductive and tasteful melody. Each of these components is clear as the midday sun on "Rain or Shine", a well-designed studio session". In JazzTimes, Thomas Conrad wrote: "In the liner notes, Houston Person says, “Few people get into this kind of groove these days.” So true. It is the sensual, slightly sweaty, blues-based groove they used to call soul-jazz. It was central to the jazz art form (and to its commercial viability) in the 1960s. But in our current eclectic, experimental era, it is a quaint niche. When you hear an authentic voice of the genre like Person, you remember how easy it is to like this music ... The program contains standards, old R&amp;B hits and lost gems ... The members of Person’s sextet all speak this rich musical language as their native tongue". In The Observer, Dave Gelly said "Although he doesn't attract much critical attention, Houston Person must have a large and loyal following, judging by the number of albums he's made over the years. They’re a discriminating crowd, too, if this latest example is anything to go by. Ballads, blues, R&amp;B classics – gently but unerringly his soulful tenor saxophone brings out their beauty, enhancing a melody with a few deft strokes. He can pick a good band, too". In The Times, Chris Pearson observed "Houston Person was playing tough tenor when Alexander was a babe in arms and is still going strong in every sense. On "Rain or Shine" the soul-jazz pioneer leads a sextet through a set made up mostly of crate-digging rhythm’n’blues tunes ... a tenor-sax tonic for the winter blues"

Kim Bok-dong

Kim Bok-dong (19 April 1926 – 28 January 2019) was among many young women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese Imperial Army. She later became a Korean human rights activist who campaigned against sexual slavery and war rape. She was one of many young women who were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military; a military that systematically recruited girls between the ages of 10 to 18 years of age from colonized and occupied countries from the 1930s until the end of World War II. From age 14, she was imprisoned in comfort stations for eight years across different countries in Asia. Her experiences evoked in her a feminist consciousness and led her to become a strong activist, advocating the end of war-time sexual violence, anti-imperialism, workers' rights, and inter-Korean reconciliation. Along with the other so-called "comfort women", she has made the three-fold demand from the Japanese government: a formal state-level apology, reparations, and correction of Japanese history (including amending Japanese history textbooks to include the truth of the "comfort women" issue). In addition, Kim Bok-dong herself also supported other "comfort women" to step forward, and was a leader and spokesperson in the "comfort women" movement. Kim Bok-dong died in Seoul, South Korea, in hospital, on January 28, 2019.
Background.
Kim Bok-dong was born in Yangsan, Gyeongnam, South Korea in March 1926. She was the fourth of six daughters. Her family was wealthy when she was young. However, later her family struggled economically and faced poverty. As a result, she had to put an end to her education. Bok-dong's father died when she was eight years old. Her three older sisters married to escape the hard times. Kim Bok-dong remained at home with her two younger sisters. Until at age 14~15 in 1941, Kim Bok-dong and her mother were cheated by Japanese authorities. Kim Bok-dong was told that she was to support the war efforts by working in a military clothing factory and would return in three years. If not, her family would be considered traitors. The Japanese authorities did not just take Kim Bok-dong away but demanded that her mother sign a document. Her mother could not read so she conceded to the demand, believing that her daughter would work in a factory in Japan. Instead, she was forced into militarized sexual slavery in Japanese occupied territories for eight years, including Guangdong, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Kim Bok-dong had to have sex every day, especially from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays.
She tried to commit suicide with two other girls by alcohol poisoning, but Japanese found them unconscious. The army took them to the hospital and the medics revived them by pumping their stomachs, hurting them permanently. Ten days later, she finally woke up and decided to live to tell what happened. She said if her father had been alive, she might not have been helplessly taken away. At age 21 and after the war, Kim Bok-dong finally returned to her hometown. 
She did not tell her family what she had suffered, except her mother. Unfortunately, her mother became very distressed and died from a heart attack.
After her return, she began to visit a temple. After the Korean War, she owned and operated a successful restaurant in Busan where her older sisters lived. Kim Bok-dong eventually met a man whom she fell in love with. Despite having this love, she suffered throughout her life because she was never able to have a child. She believes this was a result of the sexual abuse she endured. Along with this, the man whom she married later died, not knowing her story. It was not until after her husband died that she began to speak about her experience.
Activism.
Kim Bok-dong stated, "Even as I returned to my homeland, it was never true liberation for me." After her husband died she began to speak out, and later joined another woman seeking official recognition as victims of Japanese sex slavery. In 1992, a year after Kim Hak-sun first broke silence on the issue, Kim Bok-dong finally publicly began to share her experience and detail what happened to her during her time as a sex slave. This was also the year in which she began to participate in the weekly protest, the Wednesday Demonstration, in front of the Japanese Embassy. Then in 1993, Kim Bok-dong attended and testified at the "World Human Rights Conference" in Vienna, Austria. She has since testified during other events in Japan and the United States. Kim Bok-dong has traveled around other parts of the world to tell her story and continues to participate in weekly protests. In an interview, Kim Bok-dong states, "by presenting my testimony, I regain my sense of self and feel supported and connected with other women." Networking and connecting with other women has allowed her to recognize that there are many people who suffered like she did and given her a sense of community, that she is not alone; nor are they. Kim Bok-dong has been attending the Wednesday rallies to demand a formal apology from Japan and legal reparations from the Korean women who were forced into sexual slavery during the war, for more than 20 years now. Kim Bok-dong acknowledges and recognizes that she has gained a platform where she is able to receive support from both ordinary people and the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan (KCWD). She emphasizes to her supporters and the public at large that they should do the right thing not just for her but for those without a voice, who have gone through similar struggles she has faced as well as for the next generation.
The Butterfly Fund.
Standing in solidarity with other ‘comfort women’ and wartime rape victims, Kim Bok-dong and Gil Won-ok, established The Butterfly Fund, in efforts to help female victims of sexual violence in armed conflicts around the world. The name, "The Butterfly Fund" has meaning. Kim Bok-dong states that the symbolic meaning behind the name is that, "We as activist would like the victims to be free from their hurtful past, like a butterfly that has just come out of its cocoon." The fund was started with money from personal donations. In the early stages of the fund, Kim Bok-dong and Gil Won-ok declared that they would donate all the money they received as reparations from the Japanese to other women as reparation to those who suffered from war just like they had. Eventually, the KCWD formally established the "Butterfly Fund" in order to accomplish Gil Won-ok and Kim Bok-dong's objective. The fund began to provide support in the form of $500 per month to a victim support group in Congo in July 2012. This amount would then be expanded once the Japanese governments pays reparation. The first beneficiary of the fund was Rebecca Masika Katsuva, who now runs a shelter for victims like herself. Kim Bok-dong states, "It will fly high as emancipatory butterfly to many women war victims with the name of the halmeon." The overarching idea behind the fund was to help and network with sexual violence victims in other countries, not only women in the same geographic space as the founders. For example, the fund has been used to aid Vietnamese women who were raped by Korean Soldiers from 1964 to 1973 during the Vietnam war. Kim Bok-dong also highlights that Korea too should make efforts to acknowledge war crimes committed by its own people.
Artwork.
In addition to sharing her stories to the public verbally, Kim Bok-dong also created art to share with the public. In 1992, Kim Bok-dong began to live in the House of Sharing due to living a lonely life in Busan. During her time at the House of Sharing, she participated in an art therapy program in which she grabbed the brush and began painting. Her artwork tells her history to future generations. Artwork from the House of Sharing has been included in campaigns to raise awareness and educate the global public on the 'comfort women' issue. Her artistic themes include: childhood memories, the experience of Japanese military slavery, and her present life and feelings. She works in paint, woodblock print, and pencil. Her works include "The Day a 14 year old Girl is Stolen Away" (1998), "As Youth Slips Away, and Suddenly I am Old and Grey" (1998), "Japan Do Not Trespass - Dok Island is Our Land" (1998), and "The Leaves of that Gaunt Tree will Blossom Someday" (1998).

Michael Waltz

Michael George Glen Waltz (born January 31, 1974) is an American politician and United States Army officer serving as the U.S. Representative for Florida's 6th congressional district. A member of the Republican Party, he was first elected in the 2018 Midterm elections and succeeded Ron DeSantis, who went on to be elected the 46th governor of Florida.
Early life and education.
Waltz was born in Boynton Beach, FL and grew up in Jacksonville, Florida. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in international studies from the Virginia Military Institute and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Army.
Career.
Congressman Mike Waltz represents Florida's 6th congressional district, which includes Flagler, Volusia, Lake, and St. Johns counties. Waltz is a combat-decorated Green Beret still serving as a colonel in the U.S. Army National Guard, a former White House and Pentagon policy advisor. He is the first Green Beret to be elected to Congress.
Waltz graduated with honors as a Distinguished Military Graduate from the Virginia Military Institute, and has served over 24 years in the U.S. Army. After commissioning as an Army lieutenant, Waltz graduated Ranger School and was selected to be a Green Beret, serving worldwide as a Special Forces officer with multiple tours in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa. For his actions in combat, Waltz was decorated with four Bronze Stars including two with valor.
He worked in the Pentagon as a defense policy director for Secretaries of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates. Waltz then went on to serve in the White House as the vice president's counterterrorism advisor. Waltz wrote "Warrior Diplomat: A Green Beret’s Battles from Washington to Afghanistan." .
In 2010, Waltz helped found an analytics and training company Metis Solutions. It was bought in November 2020 by Pacific Architects and Engineers for $92 million.
Political positions.
War in Afghanistan.
After telling an anecdote to the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference audience about his time serving in Afghanistan during the public announcement of the Obama-era troop withdrawals, Waltz stated about the War in Afghanistan, "So, are we 15 years in? Yes. Are we in for a lot more fighting and do we need a long-term strategy to undermine the ideology of Islamic extremism — just like we did fascism and just like we did communism? — yes, we do. Uh, and you know, I think we're in for a long haul and I think our nation's leadership needs to begin telling the American people 'I'm sorry, we don't have a choice, we're 15 years in to what is going to be a multi-generational war because we're talking about defeating an idea.' It's easy to bomb a tank, very difficult to defeat an idea and that's exactly what we have to do." Following his statement, a CPAC audience member can be heard disrupting the panel and shouting "It's impossible" in reply to Waltz's stance on the war.
Chinese Communist Party.
Waltz is considered one of the most hawkish members of Congress as it relates to America's posture towards China, saying "We are in a Cold War with the Chinese Communist Party." In 2021, Waltz was the first member of Congress to call for a full U.S. boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics over the CCP's treatment of Chinese Uyghur populations and the enslavement, forced labor, and concentration camp of these ethnic minorities in China.
U.S. House of Representatives.
Elections.
Waltz ran for Florida's 6th congressional district in 2018 to succeed incumbent Republican Ron DeSantis, who retired before being elected Governor of Florida in a close race. He defeated John Ward and Fred Costello in the Republican primary before facing off against Democratic nominee Nancy Soderberg, a former representative at the United Nations and the former Deputy National Security Advisor, in the general election. Waltz won with 56.31% of the vote to Soderberg's 43.69%.
Incumbent Waltz was challenged by Democratic Party candidate Clint Curtis. Waltz received 265,393 votes (60.64%), while Curtis received 172,305 (39.36%).
Tenure.
He won the election over Democrat Nancy Soderberg and was sworn in to the 116th United States Congress on January 3, 2019.
In April 2020, Waltz joined the National Guard's COVID-19 response efforts as a colonel on the planning staff. On November 6, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Waltz tested positive for the virus.
In December 2020, Waltz was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives who signed an amicus brief in support of "Texas v. Pennsylvania", a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden prevailed over incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of the election held by another state. Shortly thereafter, the "Orlando Sentinel" editorial board rescinded its endorsement of Waltz in the 2020 election. The "Orlando Sentinel" wrote, "We had no idea, had no way of knowing at the time, that Waltz was not committed to democracy."
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion." Additionally, Pelosi reprimanded Waltz and the other House members who supported the lawsuit: "The 126 Republican Members that signed onto this lawsuit brought dishonor to the House. Instead of upholding their oath to support and defend the Constitution, they chose to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions." New Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell, citing section three of the 14th Amendment, called for Pelosi to not seat Waltz and the other Republicans who signed the brief supporting the suit. Pascrell argued that "the text of the 14th Amendment expressly forbids Members of Congress from engaging in rebellion against the United States. Trying to overturn a democratic election and install a dictator seems like a pretty clear example of that."
Waltz, along with all other Senate and House Republicans, voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
On May 19, 2021, Waltz voted against legislation to establish the formation of a January 6 commission meant to investigate the storming of the U.S. Capitol.
In August 2021, Waltz called on President Joe Biden to relaunch the War in Afghanistan. Waltz used to manage a lucrative defense contracting firm with offices in Afghanistan, which he sold and profited $26 million.
Committee assignments.
Caucus memberships.
Waltz is a member of the following Congressional caucuses.
Personal life.
He is the father of a teenage girl, and is engaged to Dr. Julia Nesheiwat, herself a combat veteran who served in the Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations, most recently as Homeland Security Advisor to President Trump. They live in St. Johns County, FL.

2018 Texas Longhorns football team

The 2018 Texas Longhorns football team, known variously as "Texas", "UT", the "Longhorns", or the "Horns”, represented the University of Texas at Austin during the 2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Longhorns played their home games at Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium in Austin, Texas, and competed as members of the Big 12 Conference. They were led by second-year head coach Tom Herman.
Texas, coming off a 7–6 season in Herman's first year, began the year ranked 23rd in the preseason AP Poll. In the first game of the year, the Longhorns were upset by Maryland in a game played at FedExField in Landover, Maryland. The team won its next six games, including a dramatic win over No. 7 Oklahoma in the 113th Red River Showdown. The Longhorns rose to as high as No. 6 in the AP Poll, but fell in consecutive weeks to Oklahoma State and West Virginia. At the end of the regular season, Texas had a record of 7–2 in Big 12 play, good for second in the standings and earning them a spot in the Big 12 Championship Game against Oklahoma. The Sooners won the rematch by a score of 39–27. Texas was invited to the Sugar Bowl to play SEC runner-up No. 5 Georgia, which Texas won in an upset by a score of 28–21. They finished with an overall record of 10–4 and were ranked 9th in the final AP Poll, the most wins and highest ranked finish for the school since 2009.
The team was led on offense by sophomore quarterback Sam Ehlinger, who finished with 3,292 passing yards, 25 passing touchdowns, and a Big 12-leading 16 rushing touchdowns. His 41 total touchdowns was third in the conference and seventh nationally. Wide receiver Lil'Jordan Humphrey led the team with 1,176 receiving yards. On defense, the team had three first-team all-conference members in defensive lineman Charles Omenihu and defensive backs Kris Boyd and Caden Sterns.
Previous season.
The Longhorns finished the 2017 season 7–6, 5–4 in Big 12 play to finish in four-way tie for fourth place. They were invited to the Texas Bowl where they defeated Missouri.

Game summaries.
at Kansas State.
Texas lost their first game on the road at Maryland and then won their next three games at home, and their last two victories came against ranked teams—No. 22 Southern California and No. 17 TCU. But the travel games (especially in this series) have not been in the Longhorn's favor. The home team has won last six games between the two teams and Texas has not won in Manhattan since 2002.
Texas was the only team to score in the first half of play, with two touchdowns, a field goal, and a safety. Kansas State had a chance to score a touchdown on the final play of the first half when Alex Delton threw a pass to Adam Harter that was dropped in the end zone. The score at the half was Texas 19, Kansas State 0.
Kansas State fared better in the second half, holding Texas scoreless and replacing Alex Delton with Skylar Thompson. Thompson led Kansas State to score two touchdowns in the second half with 14 points. In the end, Texas held the lead with a final score of 19-14. For the next week Texas plays Oklahoma after stopping the second-half comeback by Kansas State.
vs Oklahoma.
The 2018 edition of this classic rivalry matchup was pivotal for both the Longhorns and the Sooners, as both had something to prove; OU was playing its first ranked opponent of the season, and Texas was trying to show that it could once again compete with the elite of the NCAA after years of very average performances. This year's game, which ended in a Longhorn victory, was the highest-scoring Red River Showdown game in history, with a combined score of 93. A memorable aspect of this game was Texas' dominance until midway through the fourth quarter, only to eventually surrender a 21-point lead to the Sooners late in the game; Heisman candidate Kyler Murray put on an incredible performance, showcasing his superior speed and accuracy. This comeback, however, did not come to fruition, as Texas kicker Cameron Dicker made a 40-yard field goal with approximately 9 seconds remaining on the clock to win the game for Texas.

His thesis, titled ‘Prognostic Modeling for Clinical Decision Making: Theory and Applications’, was completed in 1996. Subsequently, Steyerberg held a position at Erasmus Medical Centre. He spent sabbaticals at Duke University (Durham, NC: 1996) and Harvard University (Boston, MA: 2003 and 2005). In 2006, he was appointed professor at Erasmus MC, where he has been the chair of the Medical Decision Making group till the end of 2016. In 2017, Steyerberg was appointed as Chair of the Department of Biomedical Data Sciences at Leiden University Medical Center.
Research findings.
Steyerberg’s methodological research is mainly focussed on clinical prediction modeling. He has developed and applied advanced regression modeling and related statistical techniques for prediction in many medical domains. Other areas of interest include design and analysis of randomized clinical trials, cost-effectiveness, decision analysis, and quality of care research, all with the aim to make better decisions in health care. Contemporary research themes have his attention, including Comparative effectiveness research, Big data, Machine learning, Value-based Healthcare and Precision medicine.
Medical fields of application include oncology (e.g. testicular, bladder, prostate, esophageal, colorectal, lymphomas, and hereditary cancers); cardiovascular disease (e.g. acute myocardial infarction, heart valve replacement, limb ischemia, primary and secondary prevention of CVD); internal medicine (e.g. renovascular hypertension, osteoporosis); pediatrics (e.g. triage systems); infectious diseases (e.g. leprosy, chlamydia trachomatis screening); neurology (Guillain Barré syndrome, stroke); and traumatic brain injury (prognosis and efficiency of trial design, comparative effectiveness research, new biomarkers).
Achievements.
Steyerberg is known for his tremendous contribution to the field of statistical methods for prediction research. Among his most-cited articles are several methodological papers on the development and validation of clinical prediction models. In 2009, he published his book ‘Clinical Prediction Models:
A Practical Approach to Development, Validation, and Updating’. The book provides insight and practical illustrations on how modern statistical concepts and regression methods can be applied in medical prediction problems, including diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. It has become both a practical guide and reference work for anyone involved in prediction research in medicine. A second edition was published in 2019.
Steyerberg received a fellowship from the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences and the John M. Eisenberg Award for Practical Application of Medical Decision Making Research by the Society for Medical Decision Making in 2016. In 2019 Steyerberg was elected as member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.
Personal life.
Steyerberg currently lives in Rotterdam, in the neighborhood Hillegersberg, with his wife, Aleida Steyerberg-Sluijk, a manager, and their three children Matthijs, Laurens, and Suzanne. The Steyerberg family owns a Labrador, named Bas. As an amateur runner, Steyerberg finished three marathons. His personal best, 3:51, was set at the Rotterdam Marathon in 2010. Together with his sons he is interested in cryptocurrency.

Marshall Hotel (Chicago)

The Marshall Hotel is a historic residential hotel located at 1232 N. LaSalle Street in the Near North Side neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. Built in 1927, the hotel was one of several residential hotels built to house an influx of workers to Chicago in the 1920s. While the hotel offered rooms to both temporary and permanent residents, census records indicate that most of its residents were permanent. Architect Edmund Meles, who designed several hotels and apartment buildings in Chicago in the 1920s, designed the building in a mix of the Classical Revival and Renaissance Revival styles. The building has a brick exterior and features a limestone arched entrance, arched lintels with keystones around the first-floor windows, limestone quoins, and a pediment with an urn.
The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 27, 2017.

Peace Monument of Glendale

The Peace Monument of Glendale is an exact replica of the original memorial dedicated to comfort women, the Statue of Peace. The statue is located in Central Park near the Glendale Public Library in Glendale, California, United States. The Glendale Peace Monument was funded and built in 2013 by the Korean American Forum of California, a non-profit human rights organization. The installation of the memorial happened shortly after Toru Hashimoto, former mayor of Osaka, Japan, expressed that comfort women were necessary to maintain discipline within the Japanese army during World War II. The unveiling of the statue was also considered a celebration due to the passing of a 2007 United States House of Representatives resolution, which urged the Japanese government to accept responsibility for their wartime crimes.
Appearance.
The 1,100 pound bronze statue monument is a replica of the original comfort women statue located in Seoul, South Korea. It depicts a girl sitting in a chair, with an empty chair beside her. The chair represents aging survivors who have not yet received justice, as well as space for people to sit and reflect on how women and girls were subjected to become sex slaves during the Japanese wartime. The statue of the girl herself represents many different aspects and effects of the violence and exploitation experienced by comfort women. For example, the statue portrays a girl with unevenly cut hair due to it being torn off. The unevenness and rough appearance of the hair represents the suffering comfort women endured as a result of being taken from their homes and forced into sex slavery. Her clenched fist represent her resolve for justice, as well as her resolve for endurance and defiance against her injustice. Her bare unsettled feet represent being abandoned by the world, along with her inability to ground and settle herself, unable to completely trust her environment. The bronze bird located at the top of her left shoulder symbolizes not only the connection between the living and the deceased, but as a symbol of freedom and peace. The shadow behind the young girl is of an elderly woman, fragmented pieces of painful memories symbolizing the passing of time with her trauma left unspoken. Finally, is the butterfly located at the center of shadow's body, right at her heart. This butterfly depicts the hope to be reincarnated with a new life in a different world, but also that one day, whether in this life or the next, the sexually exploited victims of Japanese colonial rule, comfort women, will receive their apology.
Controversy.
After Glendale City Councilman Frank Quintero announced plans for an identical Statue of Peace to be installed the Central Park of Glendale, it was met with particular opposition from Japanese entities. Dozens of Japanese-Americans filled the City Hall chamber in opposition to the installation of the statue, with some claiming the comfort women narrative depicted by Koreans as manufactured or exaggerated. Ultimately, however, the Glendale City Council agreed 4 to 1 to become the first United States city on the west coast to install a memorial to commemorate comfort women. A lawsuit was then filed by two Glendale residents, Michiko Shiota Gingery and Koichi Mera together with the Global Alliances for Historical Truth-US Corp, a non-profit organization dedicated to “defending the honor of Japan”. They claimed the memorial would cause “irreparable injury” and cause discomfort to Japanese-American citizens who would be seen with disapproval and prejudice. The plaintiffs also argued that the installation of the statue exceeds the power of Glendale, and infringes on the U.S. government's ability to handle foreign affairs. Other opponents of the statue expressed the idea that comfort women were being hailed as prostitutes.
Another point brought up by many opponents was the 2015 agreement between the South Korean and Japanese governments. The agreement stated that both governments would refrain from criticizing or accusing the other in the international community over the topic concerning comfort women. Under the agreement, Japan took responsibility for the issue of comfort women, but South Korean activists claimed the apology was vague and did not explicitly state that Japan took "legal" responsibility over the enslavement of comfort women. An additional point raised by activists states that Japan and South Korea made the agreement because of pressure from the U.S. government to form a united front for national security reasons.
Other organizations known as the San Fernando Valley Japanese American Citizens League, Japanese American Bar Association and the Nikkei for Civil Rights and Redress came out in defense of the statue. The coordinator of the Korean American Forum of California, Won Choi expressed the importance of the statue because it reminds people of the rights that were violated, and to warn others about the vulnerability women face in time of war. The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the case against the statue, validating its right to remain in the park. Julie Tang, chairwoman of the Comfort Women Justice Coalition, views this ruling as a victory for comfort women, as well as giving a green light for future statues to be placed all over the United States.

Career.
Early career.
Saville started his career working in the Sales and Service division of Goodyear in Ontario. As part of his job, he was required to create 10 page summary reports using a manual calculator and data from a 4-foot thick computer printout generated each month. Saville sought to computerize this process. He brought the idea of computerization to Goodyear's IT department; they replied they were too busy.
At Saville's next hockey game he then approached a member of his hockey team who was a systems analyst. At the following hockey game, his teammate came with five volumes of Cobol programming manuals.
Saville read the manuals, then developed a system which he took to the Goodyear IT department, who ran it and it worked. This was Saville's first entry into the computer industry. He then proceeded to work as a systems analyst at Goodyear and then Canada Systems Group.
In 1974, Saville was hired at Northern Telephone as Manager of Computer Programming.
Saville Systems.
In Edmonton in 1982, he established BASA which provided billing solutions to telecommunication companies. The company grew with the industry and customers included AT&amp;T, Sprint, Unitel, Deutsche Telekom, and Nippon Telecom. The company eventually attained 1,700 employees.
In October 1999, the company was bought by ADC Telecommunication. ADC was eventually bought by Intec Telecom Systems of Great Britain.
After Saville Systems.
With the money from the sale, Saville established the Saville Interest Group. He is president.
From 1998 to 2008 he was one of three senior investors in the Edmonton Oilers. During this time he also billeted a Czech Oilers player.
On April 5, 2010 it was announced that Saville would join the board of Serenic Corporation.
Philanthropy.
Before selling Saville Systems, Saville decided to hire a president to reduce his work load. At around the same time, Saville received a questionnaire in the mail from the Inner City Agencies Foundation. He was then invited to his first meeting where he was then appointed board chair.
He is also a board member of Stollery Children's Hospital, Noujaim Institute, Brentwood College since 2003, and previous board member of NAIT, and Governor of the University of Alberta. It was during this time that Saville also made multiple donations to the university which helped fund the Saville Community Sports Centre.

Initials B.B. (song)

Initials B.B. is a 1968 song by Serge Gainsbourg. It was the opening single of his album "Initials B.B." and is about French actress and sex symbol Brigitte Bardot, who was so famous at the time that her initials were enough to know whom people referred to. Gainsbourg once had an affair with her and this was his way of expressing how he felt about it.
Song.
The song is a poetic evocation of Gainsbourg's relationship with Bardot in 1967. The song quotes from the first movement of Antonin Dvorak's Ninth Symphony, better known as "From the New World" and lyrically quotes from Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven" in its opening lines. The song also mentions the book "L'Amour monstre" by Louis Pauwels, which was recommended to Gainsbourg by Bardot. It was recorded between February and April 1968.
Music Video.
A music video was made, featuring various clips of Bardot during photo shoots and recording sessions.
In popular culture.
The song was once used for a TV commercial of the perfume "Shalimar" by Guerlain.
English singer and songwriter Charli XCX named it as one of her five favourite songs of all time in 2013
Cover versions.
Mick Harvey covered it on his album "Intoxicated Man" (1995) as the final track on that record.
In 2012 it was also covered by Therion on their album "Les Fleurs du Mal".

2018 New York City helicopter crash

On March 11, 2018, a sightseeing helicopter crashed into the East River off the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York City, killing 5 people. Two passengers died at the scene, and three others were pronounced dead at the hospital. The pilot escaped the helicopter following the crash. The aircraft was operated by Liberty Helicopters for FlyNyon. Two people were from New York state; another two were from Dallas, Texas; and the fifth was from Argentina. The pilot is from Connecticut.
Aircraft.
The aircraft involved in the incident was a Eurocopter AS350 Écureuil, that had not been involved in any prior accidents. The tour company had had two other crashes in the preceding 11 years. The helicopter flew with open doors, and passengers were required to wear both the helicopter's primary restraints (seatbelts) along with a supplemental harness (provided by NYONair), designed to keep them inside the helicopter; the supplemental harnesses underwent scrutiny as a potential cause of fatality due to the difficulty of releasing the harness.
The helicopter was equipped with primary restraints for the pilot and each passenger provided by the manufacturer compliant with . Each passenger was also equipped with a supplemental harness system which allowed them to move within the cabin and sit in the door sill while airborne. The center passengers in the four-abreast rear bench seat were allowed to remove their primary restraints, leave their seat, and sit on the sills; they were prevented from falling out of the helicopter by the supplemental harnesses. The passengers on the outboard ends of the rear seat and front passenger seat were allowed to rotate outboard, but their primary restraints were not intended to be released. The supplemental harness was an off-the-shelf nylon fall arrest device which anchored each passenger to the helicopter; ground crew were responsible for attaching and detaching a locking carabiner to the back of each passenger's supplemental harness at the start and end of each flight. Each carabiner was at the end of a tether attached in the helicopter's cabin. The supplemental harnesses were provided by FlyNYON, the vendor which had sold the passenger tickets.
The flight was being conducted by the operator Liberty Helicopters under rules as an air tour for aerial photography for FlyNYON under rules. According to a 2014 study, the crash rate of Part 91 air tours is 3.5 per 100,000 hours flown, "similar to the reported crash rates in categories considered to be 'high hazard' commercial aviation" such as medevac and off-shore drilling transport. Liberty Helicopters spent $120,000 lobbying the mayor's office and the Economic Development Corporation in 2015, according to an article about the curtailment of tourist flights from the Downtown Manhattan Heliport in 2016. Liberty and FlyNYON stated the flights met exemption criteria under (e)(4)(iii) for aerial photography.
Accident.
The flight originated from Helo Kearny Heliport (FAA LID: 65NJ) at approximately 1900 EDT on March 11, 2018. The pilot had been flying passengers for FlyNYON on flights lasting 15 to 30 minutes since 1100 that day, although he could not recall how many flights he had completed. When the van carrying the passengers arrived, the pilot checked each passenger's harness and put their life vests on. After seating the passengers in the helicopter, he locked their harness tethers to the helicopter and provided safety instructions, including where the cutting tool was on their harness and how to use it.
The pilot, following the passengers' requests for sights, flew toward the Statue of Liberty at an altitude ranging from above ground level (agl), then proceeded to the Brooklyn Bridge and Central Park. After contacting the tower at LaGuardia Airport to request entry into its controlled airspace, the pilot started to climb to approximately agl. During the climb, he noticed the front passenger had removed his primary restraint, and reminded the passenger to keep the restraint fastened, as the passengers in the left front, left rear, and right rear seats were supposed to stay restrained while the inboard passengers in the center rear seats were allowed to unclip their primary restraints and sit on the floor with their feet on the skids.
Onboard video reviewed after the crash showed the front passenger turned in his seat so he was facing outboard with his legs outside the helicopter. While taking several photographs between 19:00 and 19:05, he leaned backward and his supplemental harness tether hung down loosely near the helicopter's floor-mounted controls. At 19:05:51, when he sat up again, video showed the tail of the tether became taut, then suddenly released; this was followed two seconds later by decreased engine noises. Radar showed the helicopter began to descend at 19:06:11.
According to several witnesses, the helicopter suddenly descended near the northern end of Roosevelt Island and then plummeted into the river. The helicopter was described to be autorotating at low altitudes immediately prior to its crash. The pilot stated, in a post-crash interview with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), that a low rotor rpm alarm began to sound and warning lights came on, indicating low engine and fuel pressure. At that point, he believed the engine had failed and considered landing at Central Park, but thought there were too many people present to attempt a landing, and directed the helicopter towards the East River instead, starting the turn at 19:06:30. The pilot radioed a mayday call to LaGuardia at 19:06:58.
During the descent, the pilot attempted to restart the engine at least twice, and then he confirmed the fuel flow control lever was still positioned for normal operation. After he was sure the helicopter could reach the river, the pilot activated the skid-mounted floats at 19:07:02, agl. When he reached to engage the emergency fuel shutoff lever in preparation for a hard landing, he realized it had already been activated, and that part of a passenger's fall protection tether was underneath the fuel shutoff lever. When he disengaged the fuel shutoff lever, he was able to restart the engine, but at that point, the helicopter had already descended past agl and the engine "wasn't spooling up fast enough" to avoid a crash landing. He put the helicopter in a nose-up flare before it hit the water.
With the doors off, the cabin began to fill with water, first on the pilot's side (right side) of the cabin. The pilot stated he started to unlock the carabiner securing the front passenger's tether to the helicopter, but had gotten no more than two or three rotations before the helicopter began to sink, rolling past a 45° list. Subsequent review of a video showing the descent (recorded by a witness using a cellphone) led aviation experts to believe the passengers would have survived had the helicopter not turned over and sunk. The aircraft sank 11 seconds after touching down on the water, at approximately 19:07:26, when the onboard video camera's lens became submerged.
The pilot, who was not attached to the aircraft by a supplemental harness, unbuckled his manufacturer-provided primary restraint after the helicopter was submerged and escaped. All five passengers drowned after the helicopter rolled over into the water as they were trapped by their supplemental harnesses. To leave the aircraft, a passenger would have had to either reach behind them and unscrew the locking carabiner (or assist another passenger with their carabiner), or use a cutting tool (provided by FlyNYON and attached to each harness) to sever the tether. A passing tugboat heard the mayday call from the pilot and tied up to the helicopter to keep it from sinking further. Rescue divers responded seven minutes after the first 911 call. The passengers were cut out of the wreck by emergency responders, some after having been dragged for 50 blocks south in the upside-down helicopter: a current pulled the helicopter from 86th to 34th during the rescue. The pilot was taken to the hospital for observation.
Investigation.
The NTSB opened an investigation immediately following the incident.
Supplemental harness.
Almost immediately, passengers on previous flights pointed out the "complicated system of straps, carabiners and an emergency blade for cutting [the proprietary eight-point Safety Harness System] off in case of trouble" and inadequate training as probable causes for the passengers' deaths in a March 12 "New York Times" article about the crash. Several internal documents showed that pilots for Liberty and FlyNYON had requested better-fitting supplemental passenger harnesses as well as better tools that would make it easier for passengers to free themselves for up to two months preceding the fatal flight. The supplemental harnesses used in most flights were yellow nylon harnesses designed as fall protection for construction workers, and the pilots stated they preferred a more expensive blue harness which was more adjustable, had been certified by the FAA for helicopter operations (under technical standard order C167), and had more attachment points, some of which were more accessible to passengers. Patrick Day, CEO of FlyNYON, stated to the "New York Times" that on October 31, 2017, "inspectors observed the harness and tethering process [at FlyNYON's facility] and continued to permit their use on Liberty and FlyNYON operated flights without issue". A spokesman for the FAA stated that supplemental harnesses are not subject to inspection. FlyNYON staff were instructed to use zip ties to modify the harnesses to fit smaller passengers, and applied masking tape, which FlyNYON called "NYON blue safety tape", to prevent inadvertent release of harnesses and restraints.
Passengers were provided with a hook-shaped seat belt cutter to sever the restraint tether in case of an emergency, but internal testing in November 2017 demonstrated how difficult it was to use that tool on the restraint tethers used in flight, which were made using the ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene branded Dyneema. In February, a pilot for Liberty identified a different knife and tether that could be cut "very easily" as well as a supplier that had more than fifty of each in stock, but social media postings by FlyNYON passengers showed the older tethers and cutters were still in use up to the fatal flight. When discussing the restraint system used on the accident flight, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said: "The contraption that FlyNYON rigged up turned a perfectly good helicopter into a death trap."
Skid floats.
Although the Airbus AS350 B2 helicopter is not certified for ditching in water, it can be equipped with an emergency flotation system; in this case, the helicopter was equipped with a system manufactured by Dart Aerospace, type certificate SR00470LA. To prevent inadvertent activation, a shear pin is designed to break under of force; the activator is installed on the cyclic control lever. The flotation system was installed by EuroTec Canada in 2013.
Subsequent evaluation of the wreck showed the right-side floats for the emergency flotation system were not as inflated as the left-side floats. The float system must operate flawlessly according to specification and certification. The post-crash examination of N350LH showed the left skid emergency float's pressurized gas cylinder gauge indicated about while the right skid's pressurized gas cylinder gauge indicated about , implying the right side had failed to fully inflate. According to the NTSB report: "The trigger mechanism was smooth with no evidence of binding. Continuity of the float system control was established between the trigger, dual cable block, and the activation cable clevis connection. When the trigger was released, the dual cable block returned to its normal position (via spring within the junction box) but the upper and lower turnbuckles remained in their actuated positions."
FlyNYON and Liberty.
FlyNYON is a spinoff of NY On Air (NYONair), which was founded by Patrick Day, Jr. in 2012 to coordinate aerial photography flights for professional and corporate photographers. FlyNYON sold single-seat tickets for aerial photography flights, reducing the per-passenger cost to facilitate access to doors-off photography flights for tourists. FlyNYON marketed its services via social media by encouraging passengers to post pictures with the hashtag #ShoeSelfie, where the photographer's shoes could be seen in an aerial photograph. Day is the son of the director of operations for Liberty Helicopters, Patrick Day Sr. simultaneously held the director of operations position for FlyNYON, and Patrick Jr. was listed as the VP of charter and aircraft management for Liberty.
A safety video was shown to the passengers, which included a segment on how to release the supplemental harness in case of an emergency. The video demonstrated one passenger helping another passenger to disengage the locking carabiner and also stated that a cutting tool was secured to a chest strap and could be used to cut the tether if necessary; the video showed the passenger cutting the tether with a single stroke. Pilots were concerned about the adequacy of the cutting tools, and in one test, took more than 30 seconds to cut through a tether with the tools available to passengers.
NYONair performed an independent investigation and made the following recommendations:
Aftermath.
The family of one victim sued FlyNYON and Liberty Helicopters on March 14, alleging that it was impossible for passengers to free themselves from their harnesses during an emergency. The lawsuit was later amended to add Airbus as a defendant. According to NTSB safety recommendations A-10-129 and -130, issued on October 20, 2010, the design of the emergency fuel shutoff lever in the Eurocopter AS350 cockpit "allows for easy access to and inadvertent movement of (the lever), which could cause a serious or catastrophic accident if the movement occurs at a critical point during flight or on the ground." Airbus (then Eurocopter) had previously reviewed the design of the fuel cutoff lever prior to the safety recommendation and developed a new design, but the FAA did not require a retrofit of the new design.
On March 19, NTSB issued Aviation Safety Recommendation ASR-18-02 to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). ASR-18-02 recommends the prohibition of all open-door passenger flights that use additional passenger harness systems, unless the harness system is designed to allow passengers to "rapidly release the harness with minimal difficulty and without having to cut or forcefully remove the harness." The FAA released a statement on March 20 saying they intended to impose a ban on open-door passenger flights that use harnesses which could not be released quickly. Emergency Order of Prohibition 8900.456 (FAA-2018-0243; ) was issued by the FAA on March 23, effective for one year, prohibiting "doors-off" flights with supplemental passenger restraint systems unless those systems have FAA approval through Form 337. 8900.456 was superseded by 8900.457 in April 2018; 8900.457 in turn was superseded by 8900.506, which renewed the ban on doors-off flights for another year starting in April 2019.
The NTSB adopted Aircraft Accident Report (AAR) 19-04 on December 10, 2019. AAR 19-04 concluded the pilot had successfully ditched the helicopter into the water in a survivable manner using an autorotative descent; however, the supplemental restraints provided by NYONair prevented the passengers from exiting the helicopter after it turned over and sank, causing them to drown. In addition, the supplemental restraint was the immediate cause of the accident; one restraint caught on and caused an inadvertent activation of the fuel shutoff lever, resulting in a loss of power.

Soma Chhaya

Soma Chhaya Bhatia (musically known Baby Brat) is a Canadian-American singer, rapper and actress, known for her roles such as Goldi Nahir in "" and Shauzia in the Oscar nominated film "The Breadwinner".
Biography.
Soma Chhaya became interested in singing at the age of ten, but held off on pursuing a career due to intense stage fright. "I grew up with stage fright, to the point where I’d run off the stage crying. So acting came a lot easier because I just had to stand there and talk, I didn’t even have to be myself." She began to pursue acting "by accident" as a way of getting comfortable with being in front of people. She ultimately found the craft invigorating and credits it to helping her career. Chhaya's career took off when she was cast as Goldi Nahir in "". She found the character interesting in that it taught her about feminism. After her stint on the show, she continued to stay in contact with her co-stars. She joined the cast of the animated film "The Breadwinner" which connected with Chhaya due to her grandmother having gone through a similar situation as the main character of the film. She is set to play the lead role of Selene in the new film "Clan of the Vein" which will begin filming mid 2020.
Chhaya decided to try her hand at music again in 2016 and joined Canada's Music Incubator. She has since released 13 singles most of which she was involved with both writing and producing as well as directing videos for those singles.
In 2021, she started using the name Baby Brat for her music career. She approached her re-branding by having her new musical identity, Baby Brat, poison herself in her latest single and music video titled The Death Of Soma Chhaya. Her first single as Baby Brat is set to debut in October 2021. She describes her Baby Brat music as a hard hitting hyper-pop sound with satirical, theatrical and brash lyrics.
Personal life.
Chhaya attended John Fraser Secondary School in Mississauga, ON graduating in 2016. Her father also graduated from John Fraser Secondary School in 1994.
Chhaya is an advocate for living a vegan lifestyle, having been a vegan since she was 14, and was raised as a vegetarian from birth. Chhaya moved to Los Angeles in January 2019 to attend the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising for Marketing.
Her mother and her father are extremely supportive of her career.

Spokane Bridge, Washington

Spokane Bridge is an unincorporated community and former census-designated place in Spokane County, in the U.S. state of Washington. The community is located on the banks of the Spokane River at the Washington–Idaho border, just south of Interstate 90. The city of Stateline, Idaho is located across the river to the northeast. The community was the site of the first post office in Spokane County
History.
In 1864, Joe Herring, Timothy Lee, and Ned Jordan built the first bridge over the Spokane River and called it the Pioneer Bridge. The bridge was built about east of the heavily used Plante's Ferry, and subsequently people began using the bridge instead of the ferry because it cost less and was closer to the famous Mullan Road. 
The first settlement in the region, which came to be known as Spokane Bridge, began to build up near the bridge, and included the first store, the first house, the first hotel, and the first post office in the region. It became a stop on the Pony Express in 1871. M. M. Cowley bought out Charley Kendall in 1872, after AC Kendall became sick, which included the bridge, a store and other out buildings totaling 13. Kendall also had about 130 head of cattle at the time.

Legion of Lost Flyers

Legion of Lost Flyers (aka Legion of Lost Fliers) is a 1939 American B movie drama film directed by Christy Cabanne. It stars Richard Arlen, Andy Devine, and Anne Nagel. "Legion of Lost Flyers" was released by Universal Pictures on November 3, 1939.
Plot.
A group of pilots, because of unsavory or unearned reputations, establish an outpost of their own, running charter-flights and hauling supplies in the frozen wastelands of Alaska. Gene "Loop" Gillian (Richard Arlen), Gillian came to Alaska because he has been blamed for a crash where four men where killed. Bill Desert (Theodore Von Eltz), the head of the commercial airlines, refuses to hire him as a pilot, but at the request of aircraft mechanic "Beef" Brumley (Andy Devine), Desert hires Loop as a "grease jockey".
Brumley knows Gillian and does not believe the story about the deaths. Regarded as a coward by the other pilots, Ralph Perry (William Lundigan), Jake Halley (Guinn "Big Boy" Williams) and Smythe (Leon Ames), Gillian claims he is innocent of causing the deaths because it was really Perry who had taken the flight that night. Rumours continue to swirl about the incident.
Perry decides he has had enough and takes off in an stolen aircraft loaded with gold from a local mine. He ends up crashing in the wilderness in a remote canyon, with Gillian, the only one willing to fly to his rescue. After loading Perry on board, the take off ends in the aircraft suffering heavy damage.
On the return flight, the aircraft is falling to pieces. Perry panics and as Gillian nears the airfield, he forces Perry to confess on the radio about his involvement in the men's death. Gillian is reinstated as a pilot and falls in love with Paula (Anne Nagel) who had been the boss's sweetheart.

Reception.
Frank Nugent in his film review for "The New York Times" described the film as "You've seen all this before in your Class "C" dreams: Shacklike hangar, old crates to fly, mountainous terrain, handful of desperate crag-hoppers and so on. But this one has some new features which we'll wager you had never visualized as possibilities: for one, Richard Arlen wasn't the man who violated the code by bailing out of that big transport, leaving his passengers to perish, though how the guilty pilot was substituted in midair is not explained. For another, Mr. Arlen thrice performs the impossible: (1) lands his plane safely in a snow-clogged canyon, (2) takes off again without landing gear in spite of stumps, boulders and underbrush, and (3) after his plane has lost a wing and he himself has been concussively conked by his enemy, who does another bailout, what do you think becomes of Mr. Arlen? Well, sir, the broken plane crashes in a skidding, sickening heap on a convenient modern landing field, with streamlined ambulance service, and Mr. Arlen emerges from the wreckage with nothing worse than a bandage bound picturesquely around his brow."

One of My Three Soups

"One of My Three Soups" is the sixteenth episode of the fourth season and 82nd episode overall from the Fox series "Gotham". The show is itself based on the characters created by DC Comics set in the Batman mythology. The episode was written by consulting producer Charlie Huston and directed by main cast member Ben McKenzie. It was first broadcast on March 29, 2018.
In the episode, Jerome Valeska, Jervis Tetch, Jonathan Crane and 80 inmates escape from Arkham Asylum to wreak havoc on Gotham. Tetch orchestrates a gigantic hypnosis trick that could kill everyone while Gordon and Bullock try to stop him. Also, Jerome is looking for his abusive uncle to get information but is pursued by Bruce, who feels responsible for his actions. Meanwhile, Barbara learns more information regarding her resurrection.
Plot.
Using hypnosis, Tetch (Benedict Samuel) manages to get a prison guard to escape, along with Jonathan Crane (David W. Thompson). They then orchestrate a break, freeing Jerome (Cameron Monaghan) as well as 84 inmates from Arkham Asylum.
When Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) investigate the escape, they receive a call from Tetch, telling them to meet him at an address. There, Gordon and Bullock are subdued by hypnotized people while Tetch has a wrecking ball fall on a married couple, crushing them before escaping. Meanwhile, Barbara (Erin Richards) experiences a flashback to the time when Ra's al Ghul (Alexander Siddig) resurrected her, where he sees her as his true heir to the Demon's Head.
After retrieving Jerome's file with the help of Selina (Camren Bicondova), Bruce (David Mazouz) heads to Jerome's uncle diner. The uncle, Zachary Trumble (John Treacy Egan) has already been intercepted by Jerome, who reprimands him for his abuse. Zachary tricks Jerome and has one of his colleagues hold him while he serves soup over Jerome's face. Bruce interrupts and is attacked by the henchman while Jerome kills his uncle after learning the location of someone he is searching for. Selina arrives and tries to shoot Jerome but Bruce stops her as he feels responsible for Jerome, prompting Jerome to escape.
Soon, Gordon and Bullock find that the city is now filled with hypnotized people ready to jump off their balconies. They soon find that the people were hypnotized through a radio message. Bullock hears the station in order to find where the signal is coming from and is hypnotized himself. Gordon finally finds the station and stops Tetch from continuing the message. He uses a loophole and prompts the citizens to save each other, breaking the hypnosis. Tetch is arrested afterwards.
Members of the League of Shadows arrive at Sirens, looking for the new Demon's Head. Upon finding it's Barbara, they turn against her, as they refuse to be led by a woman. The female members kill the male and accept Barbara as their new Demon's Head. While on route to Arkham, Tetch's truck is hijacked by Crane and Jerome, who drive to the location his uncle gave him.

Rubellia gens

The gens Rubellia was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned in the time of Augustus, and they achieved prominence during the first century, when two of them obtained the consulship: Gaius Rubellius Blandus in AD 18, and Lucius Rubellius Geminus in AD 29.
Origin.
The first of the Rubellii mentioned in history was a native of Tibur in Latium. Originally a Sabine town, Tibur became part of Roman territory at the end of the Latin War in 338 BC, and its inhabitants gained full Roman citizenship during the Social War. The nomen "Rubellius" belongs to a class of gentilicia formed using the diminutive suffix "-ellius", typically derived from other gentile names. In this case the root may have been a name such as "Rubius", "Rubrius", or "Rufius", derived from "ruber", reddish or ruddy, or "rufus", red.
Praenomina.
The chief praenomina of the Rubellii were "Gaius" and "Lucius", the two most common names throughout Roman history. "Titus", also a very common name, appears in a filiation.
Branches and cognomina.
The main family of the Rubellii bore the surname "Blandus", charming or flattering. One member of this family was known as "Plautus", a common surname originally given to someone with flat or splayed feet. There also seems to have been a family bearing the surname "Geminus", a twin, perhaps a cadet branch of the Blandi.

Dear Ijeawele, or A Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions

Dear Ijeawele, or A Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions is an epistolary form manifesto written by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. "Dear Ijeawele" was posted on her official Facebook page on October 12, 2016, was subsequently adapted into a book, and published in print on March 7, 2017. Before becoming a book, "Dear Ijeawele" was a personal e-mail written by Adichie in response to her friend, "Ijeawele", who had asked Adichie's advice on how to raise her daughter as a feminist. The result of this e-mail correspondence is the extended, 62-page "Dear Ijeawele" manifesto, written in the form of a letter. While the manifesto was written to a female friend, the work's audience scope has been recognized to extend beyond only the mothers of daughters.
It is composed of fifteen suggestions on how to raise a feminist daughter, with references to Adichie and Ijeawele's shared Nigerian heritage and Igbo culture. Adichie was inspired to publicize the letter after becoming increasingly aware of what she recognized as ongoing gender inequality in her native Nigeria. "Dear Ijeawele" was listed on NPR's '2017's Great Reads' list.
Synopsis.
In "Dear Ijeawele" Adichie attempts to challenge the prejudices of gender roles and expectations. The epistolary form literary device was used to give the reader a personal and intimate impression of the manifesto. Using language intended to be seen as clear, direct, and simple, the manifesto is meant to provide parents with the tools to combat situations of gender inequality when raising daughters. The manifesto covers issues ranging from domestic duties such as cooking, to gendered baby clothes. The manifesto asserts that central to raising feminist daughters is the embracing of feminist ideals by mothers raising daughters. One piece of advice that Adichie gives is to "Ask for help. Expect to be helped...Domestic work and care-giving should be gender-neutral."
Adichie rejects the idea of the manifesto as "a parenting book." The manifesto references notable figure Hillary Clinton's title of "wife" on her Twitter account to exemplify claims of gender inequality. The overarching goal of the manifesto is gender equality.
The suggestions.
"Dear Ijeawele" prefaces with Adichie's "two 'Feminist Tools'", of which the first is: your premise, the solid unbending belief that you start off with. What is your premise? Your feminist premise should be: I matter. I matter equally. Not 'if only.' Not 'as long as.' I matter equally. Full stop.The fifteen suggestions of "Dear Ijeawele" begin, respectively, with the following prompts:
Reception.
"The Guardian" has reviewed the work in its book format, writing that "It would be difficult not to like this little book, which shines with all Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s characteristic warmth and sanity and forthrightness" and that "Some of the suggestions feel like mountains of difficulty made simple: but then that’s what manifestos are for." "The Harvard Crimson" wrote favorably about the book, stating that it "sets a standard for feminism".

1916 United States presidential election in Arkansas

The 1916 United States presidential election in Arkansas took place on November 7, 1916, as part of the 1916 United States presidential election. State voters chose nine representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Background.
Except for the Unionist Ozark counties of Newton and Searcy where Republicans controlled local government, Arkansas since the end of Reconstruction had been a classic one-party Democratic “Solid South” state. Disfranchisement during the 1890s of effectively all Negroes and most poor whites had meant that outside those two aberrant counties, the Republican Party was completely moribund and Democratic primaries the only competitive elections. Although the northwest of the state was to develop a strong Socialist Party movement that served as a swing vote in county elections, political repression and internal party divisions diminished that party's strength substantially.
The Democratic Party, under the influence of future federal Senate Minority and Majority Leader Joseph Taylor Robinson and demagogic Governor and Senator Jeff Davis, was to make many familiar progressive changes in railroad regulation and child labor, but under the administration of George W. Donaghey – who saw his administration and Democratic primary candidacy as a fight against the “Davis Machine” – more rapid development occurred, especially in abolishing convict leasing and improving bank regulation.
Vote.
Arkansas voted powerfully for the Democratic nominee, incumbent President Woodrow Wilson, over the Republican nominee, Supreme Court justice Charles Evans Hughes. Wilson, aided by his support for Prohibition and opposition to involvement in World War I, was able to surpass William Jennings Bryan’s performance in any of his three elections.

USS Charles Whittemore

USS "Charles Whittemore" (ID-3232) was a four masted lumber schooner used as a decoy ship against German U-boats during World War I.
History.
"Charles Whittemore" was built by Michael B. McDonald and Sons of Mystic, Connecticut. She was launched on September 21, 1905, six weeks after McDonald's shipyard went into receivership. Her original owner was F. P. Boggs of Boston. Her first master was Captain S. H. Perry. She was originally employed in the lumber trade between South Carolina and Nova Scotia. 
On March 13, 1918 "Charles Whittemore" lost her rudder in a storm off of Block Island, Rhode Island. The former Spanish cruiser USS "Don Juan de Austria" was sent from the Naval Station in Newport, Rhode Island to tow "Charles Whittemore" to Newport where was taken into service and commissioned in the United States Navy.
At this point, the single greatest naval threat to the United States was German U-boats. As effective anti-submarine methods had not yet been developed, many novel approaches were used. In the case of "Charles Whittemore" it was decided that she would resume her role as an innocuous merchant ship in the hopes that she would become a target for U-boats. As "Charles Whittemore" was a relatively small sailing vessel, it was likely that a U-boat commander would not consider her worth a torpedo. Instead, it was hoped, a submarine would surface and attempt to sink "Charles Whittemore" with its deck gun. In anticipation of this eventuality, "Charles Whittemore" would be towing a submarine on the theory that the submarine could sink the U-boat before "Charles Whittemore" would be sunk.
USS "Charles Whittemore" was commissioned on 9 August 1918, with Lieutenant J. Lyons, USNRF, in command.
The schooner cleared New London 15 August 1918 towing the submarine USS "N-5" (SS-57) bound for the shipping lanes in the North Atlantic where it was hoped German submarines would attack a seemingly defenseless ship. Since no contact was made with the enemy, and "N-5" broke loose during a storm, "Charles Whittemore" returned to New London on 9 September. She later conducted a similar mission with the submarine USS "L-8" without encountering a hostile submarine.
Continuing her service with the Atlantic Submarine Force, the "Charles Whittemore" carried submarine supplies, vital spare parts, and other cargo between New York, Newport, New London, Bermuda, and Charleston, S. C., until 14 May 1919 when she returned to New York from Hampton Roads to be sold. She was decommissioned and transferred to her new owner 20 May 1919.
"Charles Whittemore" later was damaged by fire and a storm off Cape Cod on 11 January 1927, and abandoned at sea.

25 Irish Songs, WoO 152 (Beethoven)

25 Irish Songs (WoO 152) were composed by Ludwig van Beethoven. The folk song collector George Thomson commissioned Beethoven to arrange a series of folk melodies that he had collected. The songs were composed between the years 1810 and 1813. After Beethoven arranged the melodies Thomson added the lyrics. His original choice to write the lyrics, the Irish poet Thomas Moore turned his down however. They were published in 1814 in "A Select Collection of Original Irish Airs" and later reissued in Thomson's "Select Melodies of Scotland, Ireland and Wales". Barry Cooper said of Beethoven's Irish folk song arrangements that they have ‘a kind of sophisticated artlessness that no ordinary composer could achieve’.
The songs in order are:

2018 Massachusetts ballot measures

Three ballot measures were certified for the November 6, 2018, general election in the state of Massachusetts.
The Constitution of Massachusetts can be amended through initiative, and state statutes can be proposed through initiative. The first and second certified measures, "Nurse-Patient Assignment Limits" and "Advisory Commission for Amendments to the U.S. Constitution Regarding Corporate Personhood and Political Spending", were both initiated state statutes. The third measure, "Gender Identity and Anti-Discrimination", was a veto referendum.
In Massachusetts, after the state determines which measure(s) will appear on the ballot, an official name is assigned to each question. The Secretary of the Commonwealth has discretion over the ordering of questions on the ballot.
Binding statewide questions.
VR = veto referendum&lt;br&gt;
ISS = initiated state statute&lt;br&gt;
Vote percentages as of November 8, with 100% reporting
Endorsements.
Question 1.
On October 23, 2018, "The Boston Globe" editorial board endorsed a 'no' vote on Question 1, saying the nursing staff ratio is wrong for Massachusetts. On October 26, the "Boston Herald" also advocated for a 'no' vote. Governor of Massachusetts Charlie Baker said he would vote 'no', while Mayor of Boston Marty Walsh said he would vote 'yes'. A "yes" vote was also advocated by United States Senator for Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Question 3.
A 'yes' vote on Question 3 has been "wholeheartedly" endorsed by "The Boston Globe" in an October 17, 2018, editorial. Actress and LGBT advocate Laverne Cox also advocated for a 'yes' vote.
Removed question.
A measure titled "Income Tax for Education and Transportation Amendment", which sought to create a four percent tax on incomes that exceed $1 million, to be used for education and transportation purposes, was removed after the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in June 2018 that the measure had been incorrectly certified by the Massachusetts Attorney General.
Other potential questions.
Several additional measures received a required number of signatures by December 6, 2017, but ultimately were not added to the ballot:
A new law enacting a majority of content from these three measures was signed into law in late June by Governor of Massachusetts Charlie Baker. Hourly minimum wage will be increased from $11 to $15 by 2023, workers will have paid medical leave of 12 to 20 weeks (depending on circumstance), and there will be an annual August sales tax holiday; the state sales tax was not decreased. Initiative organizers agreed to withdraw the associated ballot initiatives.

Francis Golffing

Francis Golffing (November 10, 1910 – January 9, 2012) was an Austrian-American poet, essayist, teacher, and translator.
Life.
Born in Vienna, Austria, to a family of industrialists, Franz Karl Golffing studied philosophy, art history, and literature in Berlin, Göttingen, Heidelberg, Freiburg, and finally Basel, where he obtained a doctorate in 1934 for his dissertation on the poetry of Friedrich Rückert. After post-graduate work in Grenoble he returned to Vienna where he worked as a journalist and radio commentator. He published his first volume of poems in 1938.
During the political upheavals in Germany in 1938, Golffing's family lost everything. The Nazis seized the family's factories and jailed Golffing's uncle. His younger brother Peter Conrad Golffing emigrated to America in 1938. Family lost their factory managed by his uncle, who was thrown into camp. Although Golffing had trouble obtaining a visa at first, in 1939 he was able to leave Austria for England, where he worked as a tutor. In 1940 he emigrated to the United States for a tutorial position at Stanford University.
At Stanford, Golffing met the poets Yvor Winters, J. V. Cunningham, and Barbara Gibbs (1912-1993). Gibbs and Cunningham were married, but they divorced in 1942, and Golffing married her soon after. He took a position at Utah State University, where he taught French, Latin, and Greek, and worked also as French instructor as Central High School. Through Brewster Ghiselin and Ray West, who curated a literary circle in Salt Lake City, he met the poet Ellis Foote, who would be a lifelong friend. Years later, Foote would credit Golffing with encouraging his work during several decades of withdrawal from the literary world:
Golffing and his wife also broadcast a daily cultural program on radio station KLO. He was drafted during WWII and served as a French translator.
In 1948, Golffing accepted a position at Bennington College, where he would teach French, English, philosophy, and semantics alongside writers including Stanley Edgar Hyman, Howard Nemerov, Bernard Malamud, Claude Fredericks, Ben Belitt, and Kenneth Burke during the school's golden age. He remained at Bennington for twenty years, with occasional leaves to teach in Berlin (where he headed the American Institute) and Heidelberg. During the summers, he served as director of the Cummington School of the Arts.
The poet Anne Waldman, who was one of his students, later reminisced, “I would sit in on Francis Golffing's class on Rilke simply to hear the German read out loud, though I couldn't understand it.” Among his many students was the illustrator Norman Rockwell, who enrolled as an adult to take a writing class with him in 1952.
In 1968, he resigned from Bennington in frustration over his low salary (Malamud expressed his sympathy), and moved to Peterborough, New Hampshire to become director of Humanities at Franklin Pierce College. Upon his retirement in 1977, he founded The Journal of Pre-Raphaelite Studies. He spent his final years in Waldoboro, Maine.
A wide-ranging intellectual, Golffing published in the fields of poetry, philosophy, literary criticism, art criticism. His major works include "Gedichte" (1938), "Poems, 1943-1949" (1949), "Aphorisms" (1967), "Collected Poems" (1980), and "Possibility: An Essay in Utopian Vision", with Barbara Gibbs (1963, 1991). His translations include Kandinsky's "Concerning the Spiritual in Art" (1947), and Nietzsche's "The Birth of Tragedy &amp; The Genealogy of Morals" (1956). He contributed poems, translations, and essays to a wide variety of publications, including "New Directions in Prose and Poetry" (1941), "Noonday" (1958), "Art International", "Centennial Review", "Commentary", "Ethics", "Euphorion", "Germanistik", "Hudson Review", "Nation", "Parnassus", "Partisan Review", "Poetry", "Sewanee Review", "Southern Review", and "The New Yorker". He also pursued the visual arts, and mounted exhibitions of his paintings and drawings.

Dead or Alive Or

"Dead or Alive Or" is the eleventh episode of the eighth season of the post-apocalyptic horror television series "The Walking Dead", which aired on AMC on March 11, 2018. It was written by Eddie Guzelian and directed by Michael E. Satrazemis.
Plot.
Daryl (Norman Reedus), aided by Rosita (Christian Serratos), Tara (Alanna Masterson), and Siddiq (Avi Nash), lead the survivors from the destroyed Alexandria Safe-Zone towards the Hilltop while avoiding Savior patrols who are under orders to seek them out by Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan); Dwight (Austin Amelio), a former Savior that has helped the Alexandrians, guides them using his knowledge of the area, but most remain cautious of his advice, since he was previously a member of the Saviors. They come to find the safest route is to cross through a swamp, and Daryl puts Tara in charge of protecting the survivors while he, Rosita, and Siddiq kill the many walkers half-submerged in the swamp. Tara sees some walkers some distance away, and convinces Dwight to help, but this is a ruse to get him away from the group and kill him. Dwight pleads for her to let him go, apologizing for killing her girlfriend, Denise, but she fires a shot and he runs off. However, as she catches up to him, they see a group of Saviors approaching. As the Saviors come closer to where they are hiding, and with Tara's gun pointed at Dwight, he quickly walks out of the brush and approaches the group, acting as if he managed to escape and reunite with the Saviors. He then draws the patrol away from the Alexandria group, telling them that no Alexandrians could be in the swamp area, since he'd just come from there. When Tara returns to the group, Daryl scolds her, fearing Dwight could tell Negan everything, but Tara explains that she now trusts Dwight, and that he would not do so.
Elsewhere, Dr. Harlan Carson (R. Keith Harris) helps the ill Gabriel (Seth Gilliam) to escape the Saviors' Sanctuary, but Gabriel's fever, which affects his eyesight, makes them lose their way. Gabriel relies on his faith in God against Dr. Carson's advice, leading them to an abandoned house where they happen to find antibiotics to treat Gabriel to treat his fever, but Gabriel will still likely go blind without additional help. After accidentally breaking open a piggy bank, they discover car keys and a map to Hilltop (when it was a museum). As they near the garage, Gabriel notices signs that the place is trapped just before Dr. Carson steps into a bear trap, drawing walkers. Despite his dim eyesight, Gabriel manages to safely avoid the traps and walkers, and rescues Dr. Carson in time. However, the commotion leads a group of Saviors to find them. As they are being escorted away, Dr. Carson notices one of their guard's guns in close reach and grabs for it, but another Savior reacts and shoots and kills him first. Gabriel's faith is shaken, and he begins to cry as he is driven off by the Saviors.
At the Hilltop, Maggie (Lauren Cohan) reviews the state of their resources, knowing that with their Savior prisoners along with Gregory (Xander Berkeley), they do not have enough supplies to last, and so she considers cutting them off. Daryl's group then makes it to the Hilltop, where news of Carl's death wracks the community, particularly Enid (Katelyn Nacon). Maggie decides to allow the Saviors to have limited rations and supervised time outside of their cage. Siddiq offers his services as a doctor to Maggie, while Morgan (Lennie James) and Carol (Melissa McBride) deal with Henry's (Macsen Lintz) lack of remorse after murdering Gavin.
Back at the Sanctuary, Gabriel is put to work under Eugene (Josh McDermitt) to help the Saviors' ammunition manufacturing process at Eugene's new outpost, the industrial machine shop, in advance of Negan's next offensive. When Eugene reports to Negan that their ammo will not be at full supply for several more days and suggests they build catapults instead, Negan comes up with a second plan, to infect some of the Saviors' weapons with walker blood, so that in the pending attack, they merely have to harm their foes to cause them to turn, rather than kill.
Reception.
Critical reception.
The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 60% with an average rating of 6.27 out of 10, based on 20 reviews. The site's consensus reads: "Focusing on different characters and presenting a new walker threat, "Dead Or Alive Or" is an entertaining episode—though one that struggles to build suspense."
Ratings.
The episode drew a total viewership of 6.60 million with a 2.8 rating in adults aged 18-49. This was a decrease from the previous week, which had 6.82 million viewers. It is also the show's lowest total viewership since the season two episode "Secrets", which aired in 2011.

Open government in Azerbaijan

Open Government principles are an integral part of anti-corruption policy and governance reforms implemented in the Republic of Azerbaijan. Two National Action Plans on Promotion of Open Government were adopted with Presidential Decrees respectively in 2012 and 2016.
Even though the Republic of Azerbaijan has joined Open Government Partnership in 2011, however its National Strategy on Increasing Transparency and Combating Corruption adopted in 2007 specifically included several measures aimed at promotion and development of OGP principles. Vusal Huseynov and Kamal Jafarov served as the national focal point of Open Government Partnership international initiative.
The establishment of ASAN Service (one-stop shop service hall) in Azerbaijan is an example of implementation of OGP commitments. ASAN Service received UN Public Service Award in 2015.
National Action Plan for the Promotion of Open Government (2012-2015).
National Action Plan for the Promotion of Open Government is the main strategic document defining the strategic course of measures to be carried out in the country during a given period, as well as establishing the sequence and the direction of the measures to be conducted in the coming years.
In this document, the Government has mobilized all necessary resources for the execution of the National Action Plan. The purpose of the National Action Plan, which covered the years of 2012-2015 was to ensure the duration of the measures carried out in Azerbaijan in the field of combating corruption, increasing transparency in the activity of state bodies, ensuring compliance of administration with modern standards of management, and promotion of the principles of Open Government.
National Action Plan guided by the principles of Open Government Partnership outlines measures for public authorities on providing broad public information about its activities, as well as the role of civil society in the decision-making process, the expansion of electronic services and improvement of quality of services provided to the population.
Commission on Combating Corruption of the Republic of Azerbaijan, which is in charge of collecting and reviewing reports of responsible state bodies, noted that 82% of measures envisaged in the National Action Plan were implemented by the governmental institutions. It is noted in the final assessment report that public authorities fully implemented the measures regarding the simplification of the access to information, provision of regular information to public on the work of the government agencies and improving e- services.
Furthermore, the number of the services provided through e-government portal increased, opportunities of the “ASAN payment” system expanded and “ASAN service” index was created to assess the quality of public services. The governmental agencies improved the citizen grievances’ review rules, and the geographic coverage of the services provided by “ASAN service” centres was expanded.
Public councils were set up under governmental institutions, public discussions and hearings were held, and closer involvement of civil society institutions in the work of governmental agencies was assured. The projects and initiatives implemented by government agencies to promote open government were outlined and support was provided to the civil society institutions involved in this area.
National chapter of Transparency International regularly conducted independent monitoring of NAP with the financial support of USAID. TI-Azerbaijan concluded that final implementation rate for NAP was 76%.
Drafting process of National Action Plan (2016 -2018).
Drafting process of new National Action Plan on Promotion of Open Government for the years of 2016-2018 was commenced on 25 October 2015. Drafting process lasted for 6 months with inclusive and close involvement of international organizations, civil society organizations, media and state bodies.
National chapter of Transparency International noted that 40% of their recommendations were reflected in the adopted version of National Action Plan. It is also mentioned that new National Action Plan project incorporates the results of the assessment of the implementation of the previous National Action Plan, problems encountered during the implementation process and their remedies, as well as all measures necessary to establish transparent and accountable governance mechanisms in Azerbaijan in line with the Open Government principles.
National Action Plan for the Promotion of Open Government (2016-2018).
National Action Plan was approved with the Presidential Decree on 27 April 2016. Open Government Initiative Government and Civil Society Dialogue Platform noted that adoption of the “National Action Plan for the years 2016-2018 on Open Government Initiative” and the scope of the measures to expand open government principles and prevent corruption are an indication of the political will of Azerbaijan.
Establishment of Open Government Dialogue Platform.
On 9 September 2016 “Open Government Partnership Dialogue Platform” was established to strengthen the cooperation, communication and partnership among state bodies and civil society organizations and to contribute further expansion of OGP principles/values in Azerbaijan. Memorandum was signed by participating parties which defined the functions and objectives of the Platform and its charter was adopted. 10 state bodies, including Anti-Corruption Commission and Ministry of Justice, whose activity specifically relates to civil society organizations, parliament and 31 NGOs established the platform.
Application of new innovation in the monitoring of National Action Plans.
Commission on Combating Corruption, with support of the project of “Strengthening capacities to fight and prevent corruption in Azerbaijan” implemented by Council of Europe and funded by European Union, launched new “Electron Monitoring System”. New system simplifies and expedites the submission of progress reports by state bodies tasked with carrying out specific measures under National Action Plan and facilitates reviewing and monitoring by the Commission on Combating Corruption.
State bodies, through new e-portal www.ems.gov.az, are sending progress reports including images, videos and other relevant documents for each and specific measures envisaged in National Action Plan. Contact points from each state body are interacting with each other and Anti-Corruption Commission in the online form. In addition to that, contact points can publish information about carried out or planned events on their activities on e-portal. This practice encourages other state bodies to learn and follow best practices of other state bodies. Another caveat of this e-platform is that OGP Platform will be given access to this system and they will able to do independent monitoring of National Action Plan without applying to state bodies. Azerbaijan is a first country in the region applying e-monitoring system in evaluation of National Action Plan. The OGP Steering Committee resolved to extend Azerbaijan’s inactive status in OGP by one year.

9-Piece handicap

The 9-Piece (九枚落ち "kyūmai-ochi") handicap in shogi has all of White's pieces removed except for the king, their right gold, and their line of pawns. (Thus, their rook, bishop, silvers, knights, lances, and the left gold are all missing.)
This handicap is very severe and, thus, not very competitive. It is not deemed an official handicap of the Japan Shogi Association. Its purpose is primarily for teaching shogi novices how to play.
Opening.
1...K-42, 2. P-76. The same first moves as the lower handicap. (See: 10-Piece handicap.)
2...G-72. White moves their gold upward and leftward in order to protect the seventh file pawn (on 73) and as well as preparing to move again to further protect the ninth file pawn from an early breech by Black's bishop.
If White were to make the same 2...P-54 move as in the 10-Piece handicap opening, then Black would be able to promote their bishop on the 93 square.
☗4. P-56.
This is the line suggested by Kageyama &amp; Kimura (1955).
☗4. P-26.
This is the line suggested by Ishibashi (2012).
9-Piece Right Gold.
Ishibashi (2012) also discusses a different 9-Piece Handicap variant that removes White right gold (右金落ち) instead of the left gold (左金落ち) shown above.

Führerhauptquartier Tannenberg

"Führerhauptquartier" Tannenberg (also known as "Installation T") was a "Führer" Headquarters built in 1939 for use as a military command and control facility by Adolf Hitler. It was located near Freudenstadt and Hitler stayed there for a week in 1940 while inspecting the fortresses that formed the Maginot Line.
History.
Tannenberg was constructed on Kniebis Mountain in the heart of the Black Forest on the grounds of an existing installation of Germany's western air defense zone near Freudenstadt. Built by the Organization Todt in the winter of 1939–1940, it has been described as a prototype for the Wolf's Lair. The site's designation, "Tannenberg", was from the Battle of Tannenberg during World War I.
Hitler stayed at the "Führerhauptquartier" Tannenberg from 28 June to 5 July 1940, following the Fall of France, using it as a base from which to tour the fortresses of the Maginot Line. This is the only time it was known to have been used by Hitler.
Most of the buildings were demolished during the German withdrawal from the Western Front in 1945. One building, which remained standing, was subsequently used to store fertilizer and other supplies by foresters. 
As of 2015, the location of Tannenberg sits within the Black Forest National Park.
Design and layout.
Tannenberg consisted of two concrete bunkers, one used as Hitler's private quarters and a second as a communications facility. The site also included a number of wood-frame structures, including a mess hall, barracks, guest quarters, a conference center, and a guard house. The perimeter of the complex was ringed with barbed wire.

Hongji Grand Stage

Hongji Grand Stage () is the Beijing Opera house located in downtown Dalian, Liaoning, China.
History.
During the occupation of Dalian by Japan, there was a teahouse Tenfu Cha-en () at this location, now called 59 Minsheng Road, Zhongshan District, Dalian. In 1911, it changed its name to Hozen Cha-en () and later changed to Eizen Cha-en (). Among the plays that were played there mostly in Japanese, there was also a Beijing Opera "Renmian Taohua" (), played in Mandarin. A large-scale reconstruction was begun in 1931 and completed in 1933. In the following year, 1934, a grand opening of Kousai Daibutai (, Hongji Dawutai in Chinese or Hongji Grand Stage in English) was held. Among the various plays for the grand opening, there was also a Beijing Opera "Peng-gong-an" ().
At the end of World War II, Hongji Grand Stage was confiscated by the City of Dalian, and, from 1949, was used as a club for the Dalian Police Department. In 1963, it became the Dalian Lu-Da Pingju Theater, and, in October 2010, returned to its former name of Hongji Grand Stage, which the Dalian Beijing Opera Company started to use as its main theater, after abandoning to use Qilin Grand Stage (), the former Higashi Hongan-ji Dalian Buddhist Temple.
In Dalian, there are other important theaters, such as Dalian People's Culture Club, Working People's Theater-Doudou Grand Stage (, mainly for Errenzhuan) and Development Area Grand Theater ().
Dalian Beijing Opera Company.
Dalian Beijing Opera Company is the center of Beijing Opera in Dalian. Although Beijing Opera was played during Japan's occupation of Dalian 1905-1945, the Company was established in April 1949 and changed its name to the current one in May 2007.

Lilias Farley

Lilias Marianne Ar de Soif Farley (May 2, 1907 – August 2, 1989) was a Canadian painter, sculptor, designer, and muralist in realism and abstraction. In 1967, she was awarded the Centennial Medal for Service to the Nation in the Arts. She was an alumna of the Vancouver School of Decorative and Applied Arts (now the Emily Carr University of Art and Design) and was a member of the school's first graduating class.
Early life and career.
Farley was born in Ottawa, Canada and moved to Vancouver with her family in 1924. She became a student at the Vancouver School of Decorative and Applied Art in 1925 and received her diploma in design in 1929. At the Vancouver School of Art, she studied design under James W. G. "Jock" MacDonald and drawing under Frederick Horsman Varley, as well as interacting with Charles Marega. In her third or fourth year, she received a scholarship in design. Farley also studied architectural sculpture at the University of British Columbia and completed post-graduate studies in theatre design and puppetry. In addition to MacDonald and Varley, Farley's work was influenced by stage and costume designer Harry Tauber, who studied extensively in Berlin and then Vienna under Josef Hoffman; Croatian sculptor and architect Ivan Meštrović, and Austrian puppeteer Richard Teschner, among others. She primarily worked in the media of wood, stone, and mosaic.
By the 1930s, Farley began to show her work at the Vancouver Art Gallery and from 1933-1935 she taught classes in design at the newly opened British Columbia College of Art. Farley was a founding member of the Federation of Canadian Artists in 1941. She also served as President of the Pasovas Arts Club in Vancouver, was an elected member of the Sculptors Society of Canada in the 1940s, and was elected a Life Fellow of the International Institute of Arts and Letters at Lindau, Lake of Constance in 1960. In 1948, Farley moved from British Columbia to Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, where she taught art at Whitehorse High School until 1972 and served as the first director for the Yukon of Canadian Crafts Council from 1973-74. She resided there until her death at the age of 83.
In Vancouver, Farley painted two murals, with accompanying bronze details, for the new Hotel Vancouver in 1939 and carved patterns for the Vancouver Post Office. In Whitehorse, she painted murals of the "History of the Yukon" for the Supreme Court Chambers in the Federal Building in 1955. In Ottawa, she completed colour plates for the Department of Indian Affairs (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada).

The Punisher (season 2)

The second and final season of the American streaming television series "The Punisher", which is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, revolves around Frank Castle saving a girl from being murdered, forcing him to decide if he should embrace his life as the Punisher. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise. The season was produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios and Bohemian Risk Productions, with Steven Lightfoot serving as showrunner.
Jon Bernthal stars as Frank Castle, with principal cast members Ben Barnes, Amber Rose Revah, and Jason R. Moore returning from the first season. They are joined by Josh Stewart, Floriana Lima, and Giorgia Whigham. Former series regular Deborah Ann Woll returns in a guest capacity. A second season of "The Punisher" was ordered in December 2017, a month after the first season was released. The new cast members were added in February 2018. Filming began in New York City the next month and concluded in August.
The 13-episode season was released on January 18, 2019. Netflix canceled the series on February 18, 2019.

Production.
Development.
A second season of "The Punisher" was ordered by Netflix in December 2017, less than a month after the first season was released. Showrunner Steve Lightfoot had an idea of what a second season would be when he first knew what the "journey of season 1" was at the start of his work on the series, and did not let the fan reaction to the first season affect his plans since "some people love it, some people hate it, some people are in the middle. My personal opinion with that stuff is you just have to be true to the character and the story you choose to tell." The season consists of 13 episodes.
Writing and design.
Lightfoot felt the theme for the season was Frank Castle "adopting the mantle" of the Punisher. The season begins with Castle traveling across the United States as a way for him to get "a look at the country he fought for but has never really seen" according to Lightfoot. Costume designer Lorraine Calvert gave Castle a "more relaxed" look while he is traveling, having him wear blue jeans. Castle eventually puts back on another vest with the character's well-known skull symbol, with Lightfoot and Jon Bernthal working to make that "an integral, plot-driven moment" in the season. Bernthal felt they had "figured out a very intelligent, very tactical reason, a very psychologically tactical reason to wear it" with it making "a lot of sense". Lightfoot also spoke to the inclusion of Karen Page in the season, feeling the relationship between her and Castle would continue "to be very important".
The makeup department worked to realistically place the scars on Billy Russo's face, who is still recovering from his injuries and is suffering from brain damage. Though Russo resembles the character Jigsaw from the comics, he does not take on that name in the season. Ben Barnes also shaved his head for the role this season and adopts a thicker, rougher, New York accent, "more akin to his Bensonhurst roots". Barnes felt Russo had a vulnerability in the season similar to Vincent D'Onofrio's portrayal of Wilson Fisk in the first season of "Daredevil". Dinah Madani has become "fixated" on Russo, visiting at the hospital daily with complete "tunnel-vision on him". Amber Rose Revah added that Madani is "self-medicating" after the events of the first season, resorting to drinking and promiscuous behavior. As Krista Dumont is "[v]ery uptight [and] doesn’t want to let anyone into her personal world", Calvert worked to make her wardrobe equally concealing. Doing this "became a really important part of her character, to hide behind the facade of the clothes that cover her up."
Casting.
Stars returning for the season were confirmed in February 2018, including Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher, Ben Barnes as Billy Russo, Amber Rose Revah as Dinah Madani, and Jason R. Moore as Curtis Hoyle. Announced as joining them for the season were Josh Stewart as John Pilgrim, Floriana Lima as Krista Dumont, and Giorgia Whigham as Amy Bendix, with Corbin Bernsen as Anderson Schultz and Annette O'Toole as Eliza Schultz announced in May. Deborah Ann Woll was confirmed to be reprising her role as Karen Page in December 2018.
Filming.
Filming for the season had begun by March 10, 2018, in The Bellmores, New York. Filming took place in Albany, New York, in mid-July 2018, with production on the season concluding in August 2018.
Release.
A teaser for the season released in January 2019. The episodes were released on Netflix worldwide, on January 18, 2019.
Critical response.
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 60% approval rating with an average rating of 6.73/10 based on 35 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, ""The Punisher"s second season leaves fans torn between the undeniably action-packed fun and the underwhelming portrayal of the charismatic Frank Castle." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 58 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".

Banks v. Manchester

Banks v. Manchester, 128 U.S. 244 (1888), was a United States Supreme Court ruling dealing with copyright. In 1882, to facilitate the printing of records of the Supreme Court of Ohio, the state of Ohio passed a resolution to establish a copyright held by the Supreme Court of Ohio's court reporter and advertised the sale of the exclusive publishing rights to a lowest-bidding publishing company for the period of two years. H. W. Derby &amp; Company won the bidding war and assigned all their right and interest in the contract to Banks &amp; Brothers. Banks then contracted the Capital Printing and Publishing Company to print the books.
Banks proceeded to print various reports, among which included "Bierce et al. v. Bierce et al." and "The Scioto Valley Railway Company v. McCoy". Although, for a time, exclusive to Banks's publications, G. L. Manchester published these cases in the "American Law Journal", a periodical. Banks sought to stop Manchester from printing the cases. Manchester refused because judges had authored the decisions; therefore, he claimed that Banks did not have a copyright. Banks's position was that the state's copyright, held by the court reporter E. L. De Witt and licensed to them, afforded them the exclusivity.
The Court ruled that the State could not hold a copyright and affirmed its decision in "Wheaton v. Peters" by stating "what a court or a judge thereof cannot confer on a reporter as the basis of a copyright in him, they cannot confer on any other person or on the state."

Angolan flying squid

The Angolan flying squid ("Todarodes angolensis") is a species of squid from the subfamily Todarodinae, part of the familyOmmastrephidae. Due to taxonomic confusion with the Antarctic flying squid the exact limits of its distribution are uncertain but it is thought to be restricted to waters off Southern Africa.
Description.
The Angolan flying squid has the typical cylindrical mantle shape of the Todarodine squids with arrow shaped fins. It does not have visceral photophores. The tentacular club has a short carpal area and has only four pairs of suckers, a number which is distinct for this species. The suckers in the middle part of the manus have 13 to 16 long, pointed teeth on their rings there are 14-18 suckers on the manus arranged in four rows. The tentacles also bear four rows of suckers, the largest of which have 14-17 conical teeth in their rings alternating with square plates. The rings of the suckers on the arms have
large distal teeth which alternate with very small teeth. The distal two fifths of the fourth right arm of males is hectocotylised and has thick pedicels rather than suckers which are almost entirely connected by the ventral protective membrane; the dorsal row of pedicels is flattened. The body is a dark purplish brown in colour.
Distribution.
The Angolan flying squid is certainly found off Southern Africa in the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean in the Benguela Current off Angola, Namibia and South Africa and it extends eastwards in to the Indian Ocean. However, some sources list it as having a wider distribution but see taxonomic note below.
Habitat and biology.
The Angolan flying squid is mainly found in the upper slope, benthic habitat of the South African continental slope at depths of between 300m and 500m, as is the lesser flying squid ("Todaropsis eblanae") and these two species are considered indicator species for this zone. The adults are restricted to near the bottom during the day while the juveniles occur in all depths apart from the surface, which they avoid during the day. During the night the adult squid move up the watercoilumn and can be found at various depths but still avoid the surface and the juveniles are most abundant at depths of 60m-80m. Normally the young squid show a preference for the epipelagic zone.
In a population off Namibia the sex showed a clear predominance of females over males, which has also been observed in the congeneric European flying squid ("Todarodes sagittatus"). This may be due to differing habitat preferences of males and females and that the only meet to spawn. The smallest mature male has a mantle length of 240mm and the smallest mature female measured 250mm. Studies of certain anatomical features suggest that females become sexually mature at mantle lengths of between 300mm to 350 mm The sub-adult and adult squid are most abundant during the Southern spring, from October to December. Analysis of statoliths suggest that the life span of this species is roughly one year but growth rates are subject to considerable individual variation and are correlated variable environmental effects of the northern Benguela
Upwelling System.
Angolan flying squid are opportunistic predators and their prey includes a variety of fish species such as the Cape hake "Merluccius capensis", in the northern Benguela Current. It is also an important prey item for a number of predatory fish species sharks and marine mammals and may make up the majority of their diet.
Fisheries.
The Angolan flying squid is not directly targeted by fisheries but it is infrequently caught as bycatch in fisheries pursuing other species.
Taxonomic note.
There is uncertainty in the distribution of the Angolan flying squid as there is some confusion over its true taxonomic position which has confused its separation from the Antarctic flying squid. This has led to some authorities describing it as circum global in the southern oceans but others in saying that it is restricted to the waters off Southern Africa.

Event marketing

Event marketing is the experiential marketing of a brand, service, or product through memorable experiences or promotional events. It typically involves direct interaction with a brand's representatives. It should not be confused with event management, which is a process of organizing, promoting and conducting events. Trade shows are an example of event marketing.
Overview.
Event marketing is considered to be a part of experiential marketing and content marketing. Experiential marketing follows the process of corporate storytelling, and aims to further engage the audience. Experiential follows a simple formula of combining a brand's message and interactive components. This mode of marketing places the target audience in a live environment that will encourage the desired outcome.
Event marketing mostly relies on emotions and the activity of the human brain. Event marketing uses emotions and is based on the fact that people remember what they are experiencing. Emotional stimulus significantly affects the image of the offered service or product. Psychologists proved that while stimulated by emotions, the brain remembers certain facts and pieces of information better. Experiencing something makes it more memorable. In this condition, it is more likely that the brand will stay in the receiver's mind and create a long-lasting image.
In a thesis for the International Business and Economics Programme at the Luleå University of Technology, Jessica Eriksson and Anna Hjälmsson wrote:
Event marketing can also function purely as a business-to-business (B2B) opportunity, whereby experiential emotions are not a factor in the event, but rather, the event serves as an opportunity to make business contacts and network with customers. The American Marketing Association (AMA) defines marketing as "Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large."
Event marketing worldwide.
The term "event marketing" became an important part of study in German, American, British, and Canadian markets. Event marketing had been considered equal to the promotion of an event in order to increase the sales of the tickets and was forgotten as a form of marketing.
This conception changed with excessive studies in the late-20th and early-21st century. Philip Kotler's "Marketing", which was published at the beginning of the century, is regarded as the first step to a clear definition of the term. It was later followed by a Danish publication "Events as a strategic marketing tool" written by Dorothe Gerritsen and Ronald van Olderen. Event marketing became recognized as a marketing tool, especially in Poland when it was introduced in the early 2000s. (Jaworowicz P., Jaworowicz M., Event marketing w Zintegrowanej Komunikacji Marketingowej, Warszawa 2016.) Polish academics mostly relied on Western studies and managed to build up the whole concept.
According to The US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the event industry will grow by 44% from 2010 to 2020. A plurality of marketers (31%) believe event marketing to be the single-most effective marketing channel, with 27% voting on Content Marketing, and 25% on Email Marketing.
HubSpot has listed 11 experiential marketing campaigns from worldwide renowned brands like Facebook, Google, Zappos, and Guinness, who have hosted or created events as an innovative way of advertising a product. Each of them was successful and attracted thousands of new customers. Marketing Insider Group has also listed 5 event marketing examples that are still being talked about. Among them, The Kia Dream Chute is mentioned as one of the best ideas. All of those events are considered one of the best marketing campaigns in the world.
A study made by Jack Morton Worldwide shows that 11 out of 14 consumers prefer to get to know new products or services by experiencing them personally.
Moreover, 74% of consumers say that connecting with branded event marketing experiences is making them more likely to buy the products which are being promoted, according to research done by The Event Marketing Institute and Mosaic.
Event marketing strategy.
Event marketing strategy is a tailor-made plan to promote a brand/product with events as an advertising tool. This includes an in-depth analysis of plans for the brand's presence at events.
In order to measure the success of event marketing, the brand impact has to be verified. Based on an analysis made by the Advertising Research Foundation (ARF) in March 2006, engagement is "turning on a prospect to a brand idea enhanced by the surrounding context". There was also a function created to show the impact on a brand: "Engagement + Trust x Targeted Group = Brand Impact."

Chetnik Command

 
The Chetnik Command () was a military operation plan of the Yugoslav government in an expected invasion of Yugoslavia. It was part of the military plans to lead guerrilla warfare, earlier developed. It was established in April 1940, including the organization of six complete and one incomplete battalion recruited from the regular Royal Yugoslav Army on voluntary basis. The six battalions (known as "assault battalions", , or "Chetnik battalions", ) were added to each Field Army (of which there were seven), placed in Novi Sad, Sarajevo, Skopje, Karlovac, Niš and Mostar. Its headquarters was transferred from Novi Sad to Kraljevo in south-central Serbia on 1 April. Between 10 July 1940 and 1 April 1941 the official name was the Assault Command (). Although a traditional notion, the Yugoslav military did not use the Chetnik idea in its military planning until 1940. It had little support in the highest ranks whose views were formed in World War I. It had the rank of Division, and was directly subordinated to the Ministry of the Army and Navy. The first commander was division general () Mihailo Mihailović. It was activated on 1 April 1941 and saw action in the April War (6–18 April 1941). The Chetnik Command had no relation to the pre-war Chetnik associations and the later Chetnik Movement of Draža Mihailović.

The following week, on 12 March, "The Indian Express" said, "Dynamic performance by all the artistes – [Savitri] particularly – and a couple of good tunes by K. V. Mahadevan attempt to revive our sagging hopes. But they are only partly fulfilled." T. M.

He praised the performances of Ganesan, Savitri, Balaji and Vijaya, but criticised the comedy subplot featuring Nagesh.

US-Bangla Airlines Flight 211

US-Bangla Airlines Flight 211 was a scheduled international passenger flight from Dhaka, Bangladesh, to Kathmandu, Nepal, that crashed on 12 March 2018 while landing, killing 51 of the 71 people aboard. The aircraft, a 76-seat Bombardier Q400 operated by US-Bangla Airlines, burst into flames after the crash, and the 20 surviving passengers were seriously injured from the impact and the fire. At the time of the accident, it was the deadliest aviation disaster involving a Bangladeshi airline, and the deadliest incident involving the Bombardier Dash 8 Q400.
A commission appointed by the Government of Nepal investigated the accident and issued a report that concluded that the probable cause of the crash was pilot disorientation and a loss of situational awareness on the part of the flight crew. The report was criticized by the airline and by the Bangladeshi representative to the commission, who felt that the air traffic controllers at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu had not done their job properly and could have prevented the accident.
Accident.
The aircraft, operating as flight number BS-211, departed Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka, Bangladesh, at 06:51 UTC (12:51p.m. Bangladesh Standard Time) bound for Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, Nepal. BS-211 was a regularly scheduled flight that operated four times a week between the two cities.
At 08:10 UTC, the first officer contacted Kathmandu Approach, who told the flight to descend to 13,500 feet and enter a holding pattern at a specified navigational waypoint. Long approach delays were common at Kathmandu due to a lack of airport capacity and high volumes of traffic into and out of the airport, so the instruction to enter a holding pattern was not unusual. Since they were slightly ahead of schedule, the pilots expected the delay to last several minutes, so they discussed the navigational elements of the holding pattern, and configured the flight management system in preparation. However, before the aircraft had arrived at the holding point, the approach controller instead cleared the flight to descend and proceed directly to the approach for runway 02. The pilots did not reconfigure the flight management system for the approach, so when the aircraft arrived at the next waypoint, the autopilot began a left-hand turn of the aircraft as it had been configured for the holding pattern. The pilot realized that the plane was turning away from the intended course, and quickly changed the aircraft heading selector to a course that would intercept the correct approach, and manually selected a rate of descent. Those manual inputs disengaged the flight management system that automatically controlled the course and the rate of descent.
The crew performed the landing checklist, with the pilot erroneously stating that the landing gear was down and locked. Because the flight management system was disengaged, the pilots had to manually adjust the aircraft's rate of descent, and failed to select a rate that kept the aircraft at its intended altitude throughout the planned descent. The first officer repeatedly called out that they were 500ft to 600ft too high on their approach altitude. Meanwhile, a gear unsafe alert tone sounded continuously in the cockpit, unacknowledged by the pilots. With their attention focused on trying to adjust to the correct altitude, and distracted by audible warnings, the crew failed to notice that the plane was still off course, and had by this time flown to the right of the desired approach path, descending at rates as high as 1,700 feet per minute. Audible warnings of "MINIMUM", "SINK RATE", "TERRAIN", and "TOO LOW-GEAR" sounded, adding to the confusion. The first officer noticed that the landing gear was not down and lowered it, but by this time the aircraft had already passed the runway and neither pilot was aware of it. The tower contacted the flight crew and informed them that they had been cleared to land on runway 02, but they appeared to be heading to runway 20, the opposite end of the single runway, and asked the pilot's intention. Still unaware that they had already passed the runway, the pilot responded that he intended to land on runway 02. Seeing high terrain ahead of them, the pilot performed a sharp right-hand turn, during which the aircraft descended to as low as 175 feet above the ground, and reached bank angles of up to 35 to 40 degrees. This triggered additional alerts and alarms of "PULL UP", "TERRAIN", and "BANK ANGLE" in the cockpit. After flying to the west without spotting the runway, the pilot calmly admitted to the first officer that he had made a mistake and had become distracted by talking to her, and performed another steep right hand turn, with bank angles as high as 45 degrees and descent rates of over 2,000 feet per minute.
Eventually, with air traffic controllers on the radio still trying to clarify where the aircraft was going and the plane flying in a southeasterly direction, the first officer spotted runway 20 at the aircraft's 3 o'clock position, approximately away, and the pilot made a sharp and abrupt right turn back to the west in an attempt to return to the approach end of the runway. The aircraft overflew the end of runway 20 on a heading of 255 degrees, 450 feet above the ground, turning left with a bank angle of 40 degrees. Alarmed by the actions of the aircraft, the air traffic controller hastily cancelled the flight's landing clearance, erroneously calling out "takeoff clearance cancelled". The aircraft flew over the airport's domestic passenger terminal less than 50 feet over the roof, and controllers in the tower ducked down out of fear. The aircraft made another sharp turn in an attempt to line up with the runway before touching down at an angle 1700 meters along the runway with its right main landing gear. The aircraft skidded off the runway, slid for 300 meters, crashed through a fence on the edge of the airport, came to a stop in a football field, and burst into flames.
Aircraft.
The aircraft was a Bombardier Q400, configured with a seating capacity of 76 passengers, and registered as aircraft S2-AGU. It was first delivered to Scandinavian Airlines in 2001, and flown by three airlines before being purchased by US-Bangla Airlines in 2014. It had already been involved in a minor incident in 2015, when it skidded off the runway in Saidpur resulting in minor damage to its right-hand main wheels. At the time of the crash, the aircraft had flown a total of 28,649 takeoff cycles for a total of 21,419 hours and was current on its maintenance. The impact forces of the crash and the post-crash fire completely destroyed the aircraft.
Passengers and crew.
The aircraft was carrying 65 adult passengers, 2 children, and 4 crew members, for a total of 71 on board. Of the passengers, 33 were from Nepal, 32 were from Bangladesh, 1 was from China, and 1 was from the Maldives. All of the crew were from Bangladesh. There were 51 passengers and crew members killed in the accident; 22 from Nepal, 28 from Bangladesh, and 1 from China. Most of the Nepalis killed in the crash were medical students who were returning home during a break from school. There were 20 passengers who survived with serious injuries.
The captain of the flight was 52-year-old Abid Sultan, a former Bangladesh Air Force pilot. Sultan had 22 years of flying experience, with more than 5,500 hours of flight time, and more than 1,700 hours of experience flying the Q400. He had worked for US-Bangla since 2015 and was also an instructor and Q400 check pilot for the airline. He was experienced with the flight to Kathmandu, having flown it more than 100 times. He had resigned from the airline before the flight, but as part of the airline's code of conduct, he was required to continue working until he had been discharged. He suffered multiple blunt force trauma to his head and chest, initially surviving the crash, but he died of his injuries the next day.
The first officer was 25-year-old Prithula Rashid, the first female pilot of the airline. She joined the airline in July 2016 and had a total of 390 hours of flight experience, 240 hours in the aircraft type. This was her first time flying into Kathmandu. She died of her injuries, described as blunt force injury to her head.
The two cabin crew members, Khwaza Hossain Mohammad Shafi and Shamim Akter, died after the crash.
Aftermath.
The plane was engulfed in flames within seconds of the plane's initial touchdown, and airport personnel immediately dispatched emergency equipment. Fire trucks arrived within two minutes and firefighters had to put out a grass fire in their path before they could reach the aircraft. The fire at the crashed aircraft took 15 minutes to extinguish. The airport was closed for three hours after the crash, and incoming flights were diverted to other airports. As of March 2019, one year after the crash, the wreckage of the aircraft was still beside the runway at the airport.
There were 22 passengers who survived the impact and subsequent fire; they were sent to local hospitals. Two of those survivors later died of their injuries. Survivability was the highest on the right side or near the front of the aircraft, as passengers on the left side were most likely directly killed by impact forces, but the rapidly spreading fire after the crash limited options for escape for the passengers who survived the initial impact. Many of the crash victims were burned beyond recognition, and required DNA tests to identify their remains. At the time of the accident, it was the deadliest aviation disaster involving a Bangladeshi airline, and the deadliest accident involving the Bombardier Dash 8 Q400.
In the following days, Nepali Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli visited the crash site and announced that an investigation into the cause of the crash was underway. Imran Asif, chief executive officer of US-Bangla Airlines, told reporters that the company's early opinion was that the crash was caused by air traffic controllers at the airport misleading the pilots, causing them to attempt to land on the wrong runway. He said that he doubted that there was any negligence on the part of the pilots. Nepal Army Lt Col Puran Ghale, who was among the first rescuers to arrive at the aircraft after the crash, complained that aircraft engineers were slow to arrive at the crash site, which hindered the rescue efforts. A spokesman for the airline insisted that the governments of both Bangladesh and Nepal cooperate in the investigation in order to "launch a fair investigation and find the reason behind the accident." Responding to early reports, the airline denied that the doomed flight was the first officer's maiden flight into Kathmandu. In later statements, the airline said that it would cover the hospital expenses of injured survivors and pay US$25,000 to the relatives of each of the passengers who died.
Two days after the accident, US-Bangla Airlines suspended all service to Kathmandu for an indefinite period. The airline applied for resumption of its Kathmandu operation, in September 2018, intending to resume flights on 28 October, but a source inside the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said it was "highly unlikely" that approval would be granted due to the many critical statements about the operation of the airport that executives from the airline had made after the accident.
Shortly after the accident, a local news agency published a video taken by Kathmandu residents showing the plane flying very low in the vicinity of the airport. In early 2019, a second video surfaced on social media sites that showed CCTV footage from the airport. The second video showed the aircraft narrowly missing buildings and parked airplanes at the airport, and the last moments of the flight.
Investigation.
After the crash, the Government of Nepal formed an Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission to determine the cause and the circumstances of the accident. The six-member commission was also assisted by Captain Salahuddin Rahmatullah, the head of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Group of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh, and Nora Vallée, senior investigator for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, where the aircraft was manufactured.
The commission released a preliminary report on 9 April 2018. The report was a brief synopsis of the accident and stated that the aircraft had touched down 1,700 meters down runway 20 heading southwest before going off the runway. It said the cockpit voice and flight data recorders had been recovered and had been sent to the Transportation Safety Board of Canada for analysis along with other aircraft components.
On 27 August 2018, Nepal's "Kathmandu Post" newspaper reported that a source had leaked details from the still ongoing official investigation. The source said that the commission was planning to assign blame for the crash on Captain Abid Sultan, and said that he was smoking continuously in the cockpit, lied to the control tower during the landing, and engaged in erratic behavior. The airline and the Bangladeshi representative to the commission dismissed the newspaper report as "baseless", stating that the story was filled with false information, designed to make the airline and its employees look bad.
The final investigation report released on 27 January 2019 concluded that pilot disorientation and a lack of situation awareness led to the crash.
The report also shows that Sultan made multiple abusive statements toward a young female pilot who he had trained, and who had questioned his reputation as an instructor. Their relationship was a major topic of discussion throughout the flight. He also spoke of a rumor that he and the trainee pilot had engaged in an extramarital affair, which had forced him to resign from the company. When telling this, he cried and wondered aloud where he would be able to find another job and stated that he had been so worried that he had not slept the previous night. Records show that Rashid, the co-pilot, who was on her first flight to Kathmandu and showed interest to learn at every stage of the flight, was a passive listener to Sultan's story throughout the flight.
The sole Bangladeshi representative on the investigative panel was publicly critical of the final report, saying that it left out the fact that air traffic controllers at the airport did not execute their duties properly. He said that the controllers could have provided navigational assistance to the pilots once it became apparent that they were disoriented, but they did not. He said that if the controllers had done so, the accident could have been averted.
In popular culture.
The crash was featured on season 21 of the Canadian documentary series "Mayday". The episode is entitled Meltdown over Kathmandu.

John Oakman

John Oakman (c.1748–1793) was an English engraver and writer.
Life.
Oakman was born in Hendon about 1748, and was educated at a grammar school. He was apprenticed to the map-engraver Emanuel Bowen, but left before completing his indenture, in consequence of an affair with his daughter, whom he afterwards married.
He kept a shop in partnership with Matthias Darly for the sale of caricatures and similar prints, "but the love of pleasure and good company got so much the better of his judgment that he was soon put to other contrivances to obtain a living." Having some literary facility, he made money by writing several disreputable novels, such as "The Life and Adventures of Benjamin Brass" (1765), partly based on his early life, "The History of Sir Edward Haunch", and others. His book "The Adventures of William Williams, an African Prince", whom Oakman met in Liverpool prison, had some success through its attack on slavery as an institution. "He wrote for two guineas a set of two volumes; and such was his rapidity, that he could produce one work a week."
Oakman had a gift for song-writing, and wrote many popular songs for Vauxhall Gardens, Bermondsey Spa and elsewhere; he also wrote burlettas for the performances at Astley's Amphitheatre. He engraved on wood illustrations for children's books and cheap literature. After a somewhat vagrant life, Oakman died destitute at his sister's house in Westminster in October 1793, and was buried at Holy Trinity Minories.

1923 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships

The 1923 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships women's competition were the first national track and field championships for women in the United States. The tournament was held on 29 September 1923 at Weequahic Park in Newark, New Jersey.
Background.
After the initial Women's World Games in 1922 in Paris and the three Women's Olympiads (1921 Women's Olympiad, 1922 Women's Olympiad and 1923 Women's World Games) in Monaco, interest in women's sports grew internationally. In 1922, the Women's Amateur Athletic Association (WAAA) was founded in the United Kingdom. The WAAA organised the first official British women's championships in track and field (WAAA Championships) on 18 August 1923 at the Oxo Sports Ground in Downham outside London.
In the United States, the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) was founded in 1888, and held its first national championship for women in the sport of swimming in 1916. In 1922, try-outs for the 1922 Women's World Games were held on 13 May at Oaksmere School in Mamaroneck, New York. Some historians consider this event to be the first "national" women's track meet.
In 1923, the AAU sponsored the first official American women's championships in track and field.
Events.
The meet was held on 29 September 1922 at Weequahic Park in Newark, New Jersey. Female athletes for the 1922 games also trained at Weequahic Park.
The athletes competed in 11 events: running 50 yards, 100 yards, relay race 4x110 yards, hurdling 60 yards, high jump, long jump, discus throw, shot put, javelin, baseball throw (softball throw) and basketball throw. The tournament was a huge promotion for women's sports.
Results.
Elinor Churchill's baseball throw of 234 feet, 5 ¾ inches also was a new world record, improving her record set the previous year by more than 10 feet.

Twisted Nightmare

Twisted Nightmare is a 1987 American supernatural slasher film written and directed by Paul Hunt and starring Rhonda Gray, Cleve Hall, and Robert Padilla. Its plot follows a group of young people who return to a summer camp they attended in their youth, and are killed off by a hulking killer.
Plot.
Laura receives a letter notifying her she has won a free weekend trip to Camp Paradise, a summer camp she attended as a child. She and her new boyfriend Shawn arrive at the camp, and Laura is reunited with a group of her old friends; among them are Jennifer, Laura, and Tak; and couples Nicole and Jerome; Gus and Sylvia; Ken and Julie; and Dean and Cheri. Laura is reluctant to be at the camp, as her developmentally disabled brother Matthew died there under mysterious circumstances two years prior. During the party, Sylvia and Gus are attacked and murdered in an outlying barn by a hulking, monstrous killer—Sylvia is hanged with a rope, while Gus has his arm torn off.
The next morning, Dean announces that he and Cheri are leaving, as he is suspicious of the "free weekend" letters they received. While the remaining others go for a hike, Ken and Julie remain at the main house. Ken goes to search for Kane, the Native American groundskeeper, to inquire about Matthew's death; meanwhile Julie finds Gus and Sylvia's bodies. She frantically phones the local sheriff, Elmer Goodes, but the phone disconnects, and she is killed outside. Meanwhile, while Tak and Shawn are hunting, Tak recounts Matthew's death: He explains how, two years ago, some of the group teased Matthew for allegedly being gay. Matthew entered the barn, where his body spontaneously combusted, after which he fled into the woods, engulfed in flames. His body was never recovered.
Back at the house, Ken returns and is unable to find Julie, but finds Kane in the barn, who threatens him with a shotgun. Ken flees, but gets caught on a bear trap in the woods before having his throat slashed by the killer. Jennifer and Laura return from hiking, and Laura begins cutting herself in the bathroom before taking a shower. Jennifer is trapped in the icehouse by the killer, while, Nicole, Jeff, Gerome, and Nancy go to the camp sauna. As Nancy and Jeff have sex outside the sauna, the killer impales them with a pole before bludgeoning Nancy with a hammer, and Jerome with hot stones.
Kane finds Shawn and Tak in the woods, and implores them to leave; he explains that his grandfather, a medicine man, cursed the land after it was taken over by Anglo settlers, and that mysterious deaths have since occurred there, particularly in the barn. Shawn and Tak are subsequently confronted by the killer in the woods, and flee back to the main house. Tak frees Jennifer from the icehouse, but is murdered by the killer. Jennifer manages to escape toward the barn. Meanwhile, as Sheriff Goodes drives toward the camp to investigate the call he received, he finds Dean and Cheri walking along a road; they explain that their car broke down. Goodes drives them back, and begins searching the property. Upon finding the bodies at the sauna, Goodes is decapitated. Back at the house, Dean searches for the others outside, armed with a rifle, but is confronted by the killer, who summons a bolt of lightning which electrocutes him to death. The killer subsequently impales Cheri on mounted deer antlers inside the house.
Outside the barn, Shawn witnesses Kane strangling Laura, and shoots him. After, Laura smiles and confesses that she orchestrated the reunion of the group to punish them for what they did to Matthew. Suddenly, a decayed and burned Matthew appears. Shawn attempts to kill him, but is unable to, and Matthew stabs Shawn to death with a pitchfork. Jennifer, who has observed the attack through the barn window, screams in horror. Kane knocks over several gasoline-filled barrels inside the barn before lighting a match, blowing up the barn with himself, Laura, and Matthew inside. Jennifer, the lone survivor, escapes in the sheriff's car. As Jennifer drives away, the flames engulfing the barn vanish and it is restored to its original form.
Production.
The screenplay for "Twisted Nightmare" was copyrighted under its working title, "Ancient Evil", on July 1, 1987. The film's opening titles erroneously date the copyright as 1982; this contradicts the 1987 copyright at the film's end credits, as well as a March 6, 1987 listing in "Variety". The film was shot by writer-director Paul Hunt and cinematographer Gary Graver, who had previously worked as a cinematographer for Orson Welles on "The Other Side of the Wind".
Release.
"Twisted Nightmare" was released regionally in the United States on May 20, 1988, and later premiered in New York City on September 14, 1988, and in Los Angeles on November 4, 1988.
Home media.
The film was released on VHS on March 29, 1989. It premiered on Blu-ray in May 2017 by Code Red.
Critical reception.
Upon the film's Los Angeles premiere, Chris Willman of the "Los Angeles Times" called the film "an absolutely bottom-of-the-barrel spookfest about a killer and some evil Indian spirits terrorizing fornicating young folks at a summer camp. Surely there's a more intriguing story behind how this sleepy slimeball of a horror film ever earned a theatrical release than there is in the senseless plot line itself."

Master-General of the Ordnance (Sweden)

Master-General of the Ordnance (, Gftm) was in Sweden a chief officer of the "Krigskollegium" ("Board of Warfare") from 1682 to 1865, then until 1968 in the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration.
History.
In Sweden, the Master-General of the Ordnance ("Generalfälttygmästare") was an appointment for a member of the "Krigskollegium" ("Board of Warfare") from 1675 and the head of the Artillery Office ("Artillerikontoret") from 1682 to 1794 and from 1807 to 1897. The Master-General of the Ordnance was responsible for the central administration of the artillery, the procurement and care of the army's weapons and ammunition, and for the land defence' ("lantförsvaret") stock supplies, the so-called Ordnance Storage ("Tygförrådet"). Earlier, he was called "Riksfälttygsmästare". Between 1782 and 1865, the Master-General of the Ordnance was the head of the Ordnance Department of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration, with, among others, the Deputy Chief of Ordnance and two "Tygmästare" ("Master of the Ordnance") of regimental officers or captain's rank, as subordinates.
The Master-General of the Ordnance was head of the artillery until 1898. That year a change was carried out through which the artillery regiments and corps were placed under the command of the commander of each army division, while the Master-General of the Ordnance retained the command over the Artillery Staff and the artillery workshops and ordnance staff. However, he still had the obligation to inspect the artillery's exercises, and his complete title was therefore the Master-General of the Ordnance and Inspector of Artillery. He also served as head of the Artillery Department of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration. As Inspector, he was responsible for the artillery in the same way as the Inspectors of the Infantry and the Cavalry, and also commanded and supervised the Swedish Army Artillery School ("Artilleriets skjutskola", ArtSS).
As Master-General of the Ordnance, it was imperative for him to pay constant attention to the improvement of firearms with associated ammunition and equipment, and for that purpose at the King's request to employ or attempt to arrange for them. Furthermore, he would submit to the King for review and establishing proposals for new or changed weapon designs and more. Finally, he would oversee operations at artillery factories and ordnance establishments and oversee manufacturing of weapons, ammunition and artillery equipment for the needs of the army. To his assistant, the Master-General of the Ordnance and the Inspector of Artillery in the latter capacity had at his disposal certain personnel from the Artillery Staff. This personnel, which together formed the Artillery Inspectorate ("Artilleriinspektionen"), was made up partly of the head of the Artillery Staff, who also served as commander of the Swedish Army Artillery School, and partly of the chief of staff of the Artillery Inspectorate, a major of the Artillery Staff, with the subordinate Equipment Department and the Inspector's Office Department. The personnel in the departments consisted of Artillery Staff officers and commissioned officers.
In 1936, the Master-General of the Ordnance's role as Inspector of Artillery ceased and in 1937 he became the head of the Swedish Army Ordnance Corps. In 1968 the post was eliminated.

Chinese traditional music includes various music genres which have been inherited for generations in China. Specifically, this term refers to the music genres originated in or before Qing dynasty. According to the appearance, the genres can be classified into instrumental ensemble, instrumental solo, theatre, shuochang, dance music and song. It is now the primary classification in both research and education, although some genres contain different forms of performance and thus do not belong to a single category. The genres could also be classified into literati music, folk music, religious music and palace music, according to their cultural connotations or purpose.

1895 Copenhagen Women's Exhibition

The Women's Exhibition from the Past and Present () held in Copenhagen in 1895 was an art and culture exhibition for women from the Nordic countries. Inspired by the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, it was designed to demonstrate how far Nordic women had advanced in the areas of education, employment and art. The first of its kind in Europe, it was considered a great success.
Background.
The Chicago World's Fair in 1893 had impressed Danish visitors with its Woman's Building containing presentations of art and literature. Sophie Oxholm (1848–1935), who had visited the exhibition, was obviously impressed by the exhibition, especially the show of Danish needlework. On her return to Denmark, she immediately brought a number of influential women together with a view to arranging a Nordic women's exhibition in Copenhagen the following year. Despite initial enthusiasm, as a result of budgetary and management problems, it was announced in February 1894 that the exhibition would not be held until 1895.
Oxholm, who experienced difficulty in managing the arrangements, gave up her position as head of the coordinating committee in early 1895. She was replaced by Bertha Buch of the Women's Society but it was Emma Gad (1852–1921) who proved to be the most effective member. Appointed deputy chair, Gad managed to complete all the arrangements on time. These included selecting the site of the exhibition which was ultimately shared between the Industrial Association building ("Industriforeningen"), which had been built in connection with the 1872 Nordic Exhibition, and the premises of Den Frie Udstilling. It was therefore possible for the exhibition to open on 22 June 1895 in the presence of Queen Louise.
Exhibition.
In addition to exhibits from Denmark, the exhibition contained areas specifically dedicated to the Danish provinces and overseas territories (Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland and Danish West Indies) as well as to Norway and Sweden. There are records of the 2,415 exhibits covering painting, curiosities (including items associated with celebrated women), arts and crafts, costumes, jewellery (including gold- and silverware), literature (manuscripts, journals and books) and appliances. There were also separate listings of exhibits relating to housekeeping, philanthropy, hygiene, education, household crafts (spinning and weaving, leather, wood, embroidery, silk painting, and whitework), music and art.
For the Den Frie Udstilling building, there was a separate inventory of 301 artworks, paintings and sculptures, listed by artist.
Key organizers.
The two women who were instrumental in organizing the exhibition were Sophie Oxholm and, above all, Emma Gad.
Outcome.
The Women's Exhibition was a great success. Not only was it appreciated in Denmark and beyond, it made a substantial profit. Gad had hoped the money could be used for an independent "Women's Building" ("Kvindernes Bygning") with a meeting room, reading room, restaurant and accommodation for women from the provinces. Work did not begin on the building until 1929. It was completed in 1937.
Exhibitors.
Works by the following artists were included in the Women's Exhibition:

Nailed It!

Nailed It! is an American Netflix original series which premiered on March 9, 2018. The series is a bake-off competition in the style of reality television, where three amateur bakers compete to replicate complicated cakes and confectionery in order to win a $10,000 cash prize and a "nailed it" trophy. A second season was released on June 29, 2018. A holiday season, dubbed "Nailed It! Holiday!", was released on December 7, 2018. The third season was released on May 17, 2019. A second holiday season of "Nailed It! Holiday!" was released on November 22, 2019. The fourth season was released on April 1, 2020. The fifth season, dubbed "Nailed It! Double Trouble", is the series' first spin-off season that features contestants competing in pairs. It premiered on March 26, 2021. The sixth season was released on September 15, 2021.
The series has received critical acclaim and was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards, including twice for Outstanding Competition Program and once for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Competition Program. The latter nomination made Nicole Byer the first Black woman to be nominated for the award.
Premise.
"Nailed It!" was inspired by the craze of people trying and failing to make elaborate cakes they found on the Internet. Three amateur bakers with demonstrated poor baking skills attempt to re-create edible masterpieces for a $10,000 prize and the "Nailed It!" trophy. Competitors take part in two challenges over the course of the 35-minute episodes; their efforts are judged by co-hosts Nicole Byer and Jacques Torres, joined by a different guest judge each episode.
The first challenge is called "Baker's Choice", where the contestants pick one of three existing confectionery treats and try to recreate it. The winner of this challenge gets a special prize and is allowed to wear a golden chef's hat.
In the second challenge, "Nail It or Fail It", contestants have two hours to recreate a complicated cake from scratch. They each receive a "Panic Button" which allows them to get three minutes of assistance from one of the judges. The worst-performing baker from the first challenge gets a second button to distract the other bakers – the specific function varies depending on the episode, but normally involves Nicole annoying the bakers. The three judges decide on the winning cake based upon presentation and taste. The winner receives a trophy and the $10,000 prize. However in one episode, celebrity contestant Paul Scheer decided to split the $10,000 between his competitors and keep the trophy.
Release.
All six episodes of the first season were released on Netflix on March 9, 2018. The second season features six regular episodes and one bonus episode, and was released on Netflix on June 29, 2018. The season ends with a crossover special, featuring the "Fab Five" of Netflix's "Queer Eye" series, with the series' food and wine expert Antoni Porowski serving as guest judge. The third season was released on May 17, 2019, with six episodes.
The fourth season was released on April 1, 2020, followed the fifth season premiered on March 26, 2021 and the sixth season on September 15, 2021. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the fifth and sixth season featured slight differences such as cake selections being done verbally rather than by running towards them, the rectangular judges panel being replaced by a large semi-circle, and the contestants kitchens being socially-distanced.
International versions.
A Mexican version of the show debuted in February 2019. "¡Nailed it! México" is hosted by comedian Omar Chaparro and professional chef Anna Ruiz, along with guest judges. Sylvia Weinstock appears in one episode as a guest judge. A French version of the show debuted in October 2019. "C'est du gâteau!" is hosted by humorist Artus and professional chef Noémie Honiat, along with guest judges. Jacques Torres appears in one episode as a judge. The Spanish version of the show, "Niquelao! (Nailed It! Spain)", debuted in October 2019, hosted by actress La Terremoto de Alcorcón and professional chef Christian Escribà, along with guest judges. A German version of the show debuted on Netflix in January 2020, hosted by actress and model Angelina Kirsch.

Rowe House (Milford, Michigan)

The Rowe House is a single-family home at 2360 Lone Tree Road, northwest of Milford, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.
History.
Squire W. Rowe was born in 1815 in Camillus, New York. After marrying his wife Dolly, he moved to Michigan in 1835 and purchased 40 acres and began farming. Squire Rowe was influential in the community, serving 21 terms as township supervisor. Squire and Dolly Rowe had the house built for them in 1855. Squire continued being active in the community, raising a company for the 13th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment in the Civil War and serving as a member of the state legislature in 1865. His ill health prevented more active service, and he died in 1866.
The Rowe House remained in family hands until 1908. In 1953, Squire and Dolly's great-granddaughter Margaret Rowe Mastick and her husband Earl repurchased the property and restored the house.
Description.
The Rowe House is an elegant cut fieldstone Greek Revival house, with a two-story, gable-fronted, rectangular central section, and a one-and-one-half story wing on each side. The fieldstone is irregularly sized, contrasting with the flat, smooth stone quoins, sills and lintels, which project slightly for added contrast. Each wing is fronted with a single-story, two-bay width porch, supported by square Doric columns. The front of the central section contains four double-hung six-over-six sash windows with louvered wooden shutters. The boxed cornice and returns are decorated with delicate scrollwork. In the center of the building is a cobblestone chimney. Unusually for Michigan, a datestone reading "1855" is centrally placed, directly above the cut stone watertable. A carport was added to one wing early in the 20th century.

Temporary satellite

A temporary satellite is an object which has been captured by the gravitational field of a planet and thus has become the planet's natural satellite, but, unlike irregular moons of the larger outer planets of the Solar System, will eventually either leave its orbit around the planet or collide with the planet. The only observed examples are , a temporary satellite of Earth for nine months in 2006 and 2007, and , which was discovered in 2020. Some defunct space probes or rockets have also been observed on temporary satellite orbits.
In astrophysics, a temporary satellite is any body that enters the Hill sphere of a planet at a sufficiently low velocity such that it becomes gravitationally bound to the planet for some period of time.
Capture of asteroids.
The dynamics of the capture of asteroids by Earth was explored in simulations conducted on a supercomputer, with results published in 2012. Of 10 million virtual near-Earth asteroids, 18,000 have been temporarily captured. Earth has at least one temporary satellite across at any given time, but they are too faint to detect by current surveys.
According to the simulations, temporary satellites are typically caught and released when they pass one of two gravitational equilibrium points of the Sun and the planet along the line connecting the two, the L1 and L2 Lagrangian points. The captured asteroids typically have orbits very similar to the planet's (co-orbital configuration) and are captured most often when the planet is closest to the Sun (in the case of the Earth, in January) or furthest from the Sun (Earth: in July).
In strict sense, only bodies that complete a full orbit around a planet are considered temporary satellites, also called temporarily captured orbiters (TCO). However, asteroids not in a tight co-orbital configuration with a planet can be temporarily captured for less than a full orbit; such objects have been named temporarily-captured fly-bys (TCF). In a 2017 follow-up to the 2012 simulation study which also considered an improved model of near-Earth asteroid populations, 40% of captured objects were TCF. The combined number of TCO/TCF was found to be smaller than in the previous study, the maximum size of objects which can be expected to be orbiting Earth at any given moment was . In another 2017 study based on simulations with one million virtual co-orbital asteroids, 0.36% have been temporarily captured.
Examples.
, two objects have been observed at the time when they were temporary satellites: and 2020 CD3. According to orbital calculations, on its solar orbit, passes Earth at low speed every 20 to 21 years, at which point it can become a temporary satellite again.
, there is one confirmed example of a temporarily captured asteroid that didn't complete a full orbit, . This asteroid was observed for a month after its discovery in November 1991, then again in April 1992, after which it wasn't seen until May 2017. After the recovery, orbital calculations confirmed that was a temporary satellite of Earth in February 1992.
Artificial objects on temporary satellite orbits.
The Earth can also temporarily capture defunct space probes or rockets travelling on solar orbits, in which case astronomers cannot always immediately determine whether the object is artificial or natural. The possibility of an artificial origin has been considered for both and .
The artificial origin has been confirmed in other cases. In September 2002, astronomers found an object designated J002E3. The object was on a temporary satellite orbit around Earth, leaving for a solar orbit in June 2003. Calculations showed that it was also on a solar orbit before 2002, but was close to Earth in 1971. J002E3 was identified as the third stage of the Saturn V rocket that carried Apollo 12 to the Moon. In 2006, an object designated 6Q0B44E was discovered on a temporary satellite orbit, later its artificial nature was confirmed, but its identity is unknown. Another confirmed artificial temporary satellite with unidentified origin is .

Root Doctor

Root Doctor is a Michigan based blues and soul band who have released half a dozen albums to date. There have been personnel changes over the years but James Williams and Freddie Cunningham have remained consistent. 
Origin and background.
The music the group plays is a mixture of classic soul and traditional blues. A good portion of their material are original compositions.
The group started out as the Downtown Blues Band in 1989. They changed their name to Root Doctor as there was another group around called The Uptown Band and they wanted to avoid any confusion. Their name comes from the song "Root Doctor" which was recorded by Buddy Ace. Two of the founding members were Freddie Cunningham and James Williams. Cunningham was born in Mississippi and moved to the Lansing area as a young boy. In those years it was a hard time for blues singers as Motown was the in thing. Williams is the brother of Lamar Williams who was the bass player in The Allman Brothers and Sea Level.
Career.
By 2005, the group was in its 16th year of the group's existence. Freddie Cunningham and James Williams had been there right from the beginning.
That year Greg Nagy was asked to join the group. He had been playing in bands since he dropped out of graduate school in 1993. At the time he was a stay at home father of two and wasn't looking at joining another group. But Root Doctor asked him to join and he did so on the proviso that they record an album of original material. The timing was right because this is what the group had been thinking about doing.
In 2006, their album "Been a Long Time Coming" was released on the Big O Records label. "Living Blues" magazine said it was a beautifully executed project.
By July 2007, the group consisted of Freddie Cunningham, Rick Bole , Greg Nagy, James Williams, and Jim Alfredson.
In 2009, following a difficult decision to leave Root Doctor, guitarist Greg Nagy left the group to pursue a solo career. He released his solo album "Walk That Fine Thin Line" in May that year which earned him a nomination from the national Blues Foundation for best new artist. Also that year, the group appeared in one of the episodes of "Backstage Pass".
In 2011, their album "Joy" was released. It featured guest musicians such as Lisa Smith, Jamison (Jamo), and Lamar Williams Jr.. For the release of their album, they had a Blues Cruise CD release party on the Michigan Princess on October 15th and a week later on the 22nd, they had one at the Green Door Blues Bar and Grill.
In 2013, their "album Attitude" was released. Other musicians to pay on the album were Dave Matchette on harmonica, Mike Lynch on accordion, Andy Wilson on trumpet, Len'i Glenn on baritone saxophone, Jerrick Matthews on trombone, Chad Bement on tenor saxophone, Michael Dease on trombone, and R. Gardner on washboard. The tracks included "Rear View Sight", "Set Me Free ", "Bring It Back", "You're Gonna Lose " and "Land Of The Free ". Also that year they were one of the acts to appear at the 2nd annual Blues, Brews &amp; Barbecue event, held at Birch Run Township which ran from August 22nd to August 25th.
In 2014, they were playing at the Michigan BluesFest, an event that runs on a Friday and Saturday in September. Other artists at the event included Big Boss Blues Band, Harper &amp; Midwest Kind, Greg Nagy, Mike Morgan with Hank Mowery &amp; the Hawktones, and the Marci Linn Band.

Helicopter String Quartet

Helicopter String Quartet (screen title: Karlheinz Stockhausen: Helicopter String Quartet) is a 78-minute 1996 Dutch English- and German-language independent underground experimental documentary art film directed by Frank Scheffer.
Synopsis.
The film, whose producer is Ton van der Lee, documents the preparations and rehearsals in 1995 for the world-premiere performance by the Arditti Quartet of the 1993 composition "Helikopter-Streichquartett" (English: Helicopter String Quartet) by Karlheinz Stockhausen. This piece requires four separate helicopters (provided for the 1995 performances by the Royal Netherlands Air Force). Within it, each helicopter carries (in addition to the pilot) one member of a string quartet, a sound technician, television camera, video, and three-channel audio transmitters, and all flying through the air simultaneously. It was premiered at the Holland Festival. The film contains interviews with Stockhausen, the string players Garth Knox, Rohan de Saram, Irvine Arditti, and Graeme Jennings, and the pilots about the piece. The film was premiered at the Chicago International Film Festival in October 1996, where it was nominated for several awards, was also screened at the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema in April 2005, and was released on DVD by Medici.tv's label Medici Arts.
Reception.
Critic Ben Sachs wrote the following regarding this film: "I'm a dunce when it comes to the music, but I found the movie fascinating, in part because the story has so much ready-made suspense. Any number of things could go wrong in the execution of the quartet, and it's entertaining to see how the composer and his crew respond to each problem that arises—it's something of an intellectual action movie".

Face 2 Face (2016 film)

Face 2 Face is a 2016 American independent teen drama film directed by Matt Toronto, who co-wrote the film with his brother and collaborator Aaron Toronto. It is presented as a computer screen film, being told almost entirely through a video chat screencast via webcam and smartphone cameras.
The film stars Daniella Bobadilla and Daniel Amerman as two childhood friends who rekindle their friendship by discussing their lives over the internet to cope with typical adolescent problems, and deals with subjects of sexual identity, teen suicide and parent-adolescent incestuous abuse.
Plot.
Michigan teenager Terrence Johnson (known by his nickname "Teel," given to him because of his inability to pronounce "Steel" while pretending to be Superman as a kid) contacts his childhood friend Madison Daniels, now living in California, via video chat after attempting suicide by overdosing on acetaminophen. The two are on opposite ends of the popularity spectrum: Madison is an "A-list party girl" with a seemingly perfect life, while Teel is a social outcast struggling to make friends. Teel decides to audition for his school's production of "Bye Bye Birdie" in order to improve his social life, despite his parents wanting the self-admittedly unathletic teen to participate in sports; Madison convinces Teel to create a Facebook account to help him make friends. While discussing her plan to attract her crush Cole, Madison takes Teel's comment that she looked "sweaty" in a beach photo to suggest he implied she looked slutty in the picture, abruptly ending the call even after Teel acknowledges she looked attractive in it.
The next day, Teel reveals to Madison that Sonny Dombrowski, another childhood friend who is now a popular jock at his school, accepted his Facebook friend request, but is recalcitrant about restarting their friendship in real life. Teel later reveals that he got in trouble at school after Sonny cheated off of Teel's test paper, as a harried Madison expresses exasperation with having to plan her father's retirement party. A day after Sonny comes to the house to make amends for cheating, Teel reveals he had been beaten up by a group of bullies, but is reluctant to disclose the reason behind the altercation. After Teel helps Madison do her makeup for a function she's attending at the school where her father works (using tips he learned from his beautician mother), Cole, who performed a song at the event, asks Madison out on a date. The day after a party where she was to meet up with Cole and finds out he had sex with her best friend Sophie, Teel assures Madison that that she is intelligent and beautiful, and that the situation was for the best because she should want her first sexual experience to be special; Madison inadvertently reveals she already lost her virginity, but does not go into further detail. After having missed the "Bye Bye Birdie" audition to go on a family trip to visit his grandmother, Teel announces to Madison that he is auditioning to be the male lead in his school's production of "Romeo and Juliet".
Madison, who has now developed feelings for Teel believing that he is infatuated with her, confesses how she feels about him and performs a striptease that he abruptly stops. She is dismayed to learn that Teel wants to keep their relationship platonic. He later apologizes about the misunderstanding and comes out to Madison as gay, revealing he had been beaten up by Sonny and his friends, having inadvertently recorded the incident on his phone camera, after they found out he and Teel had kissed during his visit days earlier. Madison suggests Teel start a gay-straight alliance at his school, though he is reluctant to come out publicly. After Teel reacts self-consciously, worried about what his friends would think, upon Madison sending a link to a gay-straight alliance organization to his Facebook page, Madison haphazardly offends Teel by blurting out that he does not have any friends beyond his Facebook following and herself; Madison attempts to reach Teel for several days afterward, only briefly getting in touch via instant messaging.
After reading bullying comments in a photo of an inebriated Madison vomiting in a toilet at a party, Teel finally decides to contact her. Through handwritten flashcards, Madison apologizes to Teel for pushing him to come out publicly against his reservations and tries to tell him that her father has been sexually abusing her since he lost his previous teaching job in Michigan, a secret unbeknownst to even her mother, who had died seven years earlier. She asks Teel to continue watching the webcam stream as her father enters Madison's bedroom to rape her. A distraught Teel calls 9-1-1 to report the abuse, though Madison, who is reluctant to turn in her only surviving parent, tells the police officers visiting her home that the call was a misunderstanding; she later informs Teel that she cannot talk to him anymore. Teel, by now with an improved real and virtual social life, decides to drive cross-country to California to rescue Madison, excusing himself from appearing in "Romeo and Juliet" by telling the play's director that he has to deal with a family emergency. Upon his arrival, Teel—who took his grandmother's car (which was gifted to him by his parents) and some of his father's money for the excursion—reveals that she helped him out of the despair that led to his suicide attempt, and, as her angry father bangs on her bedroom door, convinces Madison to escape with him through her window. Madison, now living with Teel and his family back in Michigan, gives Teel a superhero cape in an expression of gratitude for saving her from her situation.
Distribution.
Face 2 Face was originally distributed by Candy Factory Films who licensed the film to Netflix for a two year period beginning January 15, 2018. Candy Factory Films was eventually acquired by Screen Media Films who currently own worldwide distribution rights for the film.

Botsford Inn

The Botsford Inn is a nineteenth century inn and tavern located at 28000 Grand River Avenue in Farmington, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
History.
In 1836, Orrin Weston, a farmer, constructed the original portion of this inn as his personal residence. In 1841, Stephen Jennings purchased the house and converted it into a tavern. The building served as a stagecoach stop on what was then the Grand River Plank Road, connecting Detroit to Lansing and Grand Rapids. Jennings likely enlarged the house at this time, adding a rear ell and two bays onto the previously-extant structure. In 1860, Milton C. Botsford purchased the inn, renaming it the Botsford Tavern. The Tavern served as a popular meeting place for farmers, drovers, local residents and travelers.
The Botsford family owned the inn until the 1920s. At that time, Grand River Avenue was being widened to create U.S. Route 16, and the inn was in danger of being razed. However, in 1924, Henry Ford purchased the Inn from the Botsford family and moved it back from its original site out of the way of the road widening project. Ford had attended gatherings at the inn when he was younger, and had courted his wife Clara there. Ford rehabilitated the structure, enlarging the ell and installing period woodwork.
The Ford family continued to operate the Botsford Inn as a restaurant until 1951, when it was purchased by John Anhut. Anhut preserved the interior of the old inn much as the Fords left it, but the popularity of the inn led him to construct several new wings after 1960.
In the mid-1960, a development group purchased much of the property associated with the Inn, constructing Botsford Hospital and House of Botsford Apartments. However, by the 1990s, economic pressures made it difficult to keep the inn open. In 1993, the Anhut family sold the Inn to Creon Smith. By 2000, the inn had closed. In 2007, Botsford Hospital razed the 1960 wings of the Inn to make room for a new cancer center. The hospital restored the historic portions of the building, and the Inn is now part of the Botsford Hospital complex.
Description.
The Botsford Inn is a two-story, seven-bay, flank-gable-roofed, clapboarded structure with a two-story porch across the front. A long, six-bay ell extends to the rear on one side. The original 1836 building consists of the encompasses the five bays on the left-hand side, between the chimneys. The rightmost two bays were likely added in about 1841, at the same time that the front porch was constructed. An elaborate Federal style doorway with sidelights opens on the first story, with a less elaborate doorway directly above.
The interior has much of the original simple trim, including horizontal board wainscoting, plain millwork window and door casings, and several Federal style mantels as well as some wide-board floors. During the 1924 renovation, some excellent reproduction woodwork was installed.

Zhang Wei (painter)

Zhang Wei (, born 1952) is a Chinese painter and an important figure in the development of abstract art in postmodern China. Widely considered one of the founding members of the self-organized group of young painters known as No Name Group, he continues to create abstract art today. 
Early life.
Born in Beijing, China, in 1952 to a wealthy family, Zhang Wei grew up in the old style courtyard home of his paternal grandfather—a successful businessman—with his mother and siblings. During The Cultural Revolution, the Red Guard destroyed the courtyard, and his grandmother was beaten to death and her possessions burned. Zhang's father died in prison in 1968. In the same year, Wei was forced to go to the Xiangluo production bridge located in the Shanxi province in order to become an "educated youth". Due to work-related injuries, Zhang was sent back to Beijing for further treatment in 1971 and began to learn to paint on his own.
Career.
1973–1986.
After returning to Beijing, he met artists Ma Kelu, Waihai, Zheng Ziyan, Shi Xixi in 1973;he also became acquainted later with Zhao Wenliang, Yang Yushu, and Shi Zhenyu. Together, they formed an artist group known as the Yu Yuan Tan School of Painting. They would gather in different parks in Beijing painting en plein air. In December 1974, these artists held a quasi-underground exhibition Eleven Artists at Zhang Wei's house, establishing the foundation for the No Name Group.
Throughout the entire 1970s, Zhang Wei painted from life – mostly landscape and still life. In the early 1980s, he became one of the very few young artists in Beijing who made the earliest attempt at abstract painting. In May 1986, Zhang Wei and friends organized the Graffiti Exhibition which one closed down by the police before it had a chance to open due to the ‘transgressive’ nature of the exhibits. This great disappointment urged active artists at the time to leave the country. Soon after Zhang Wei traveled to America to participate in Avant-Garde Chinese Art, an exhibition organized by Michael Murray from Vassar College. New York had since become his home for the next sixteen years to come.
New York period (1986–2005).
Shortly after arriving in New York, Zhang Wei first started working with Caroline Hill gallery and subsequently Z Gallery, producing abstract art inspired by the street scenes of Manhattan. Their collaboration ended in 1992. He moved to The West Village, making a living not by painting but by working an assortment of odd jobs. 
In the later years of Zhang Wei's New York days, he was active in fighting for the right for artists to sell their art on the streets. He participated in multiple protests, including the famous demonstration for the freedom of speech at the Metropolitan Museum in 1997. Zhang and his friends fought their ‘first amendment right’ fervently up to the Supreme Court, where in 2003 their art was recognized as a protected form of free speech, a precedent that still has validity today.
Returning to Beijing.
Zhang Wei returned to Beijing in September 2005 and continued to be engaged in abstract painting. He picked up his work where he had left it twenty years earlier, combining abstract painting with found objects in an assemblage style. Zhang's first complete retrospective showcasing his abstract paintings from 1979 to 2012 took place at Boers-Li Gallery in Beijing in 2012, initiating a trend of rediscovering the dawn of Chinese contemporary art.
Recent projects.
In the beginning of 2018, he has subsequently participated in 2 group exhibition at Boers-Li Gallery in Beijing and Galerie Max Hetzler in Berlin and will be one of the three artists of a Chinese abstract art group show at Boers-Li Gallery, New York.
Artistry.
Zhang's oeuvre is described as pure executions of brushworks that created tension on canvas. Heavily influenced by his experience working at a Peking opera a theater, his abstract vocabulary is characterized by a blast of vibrant colors reminiscent of the movements of actors in their flamboyant traditional costumes. Other various visual elements introduced into his practice over time include Daoism philosophy and the notion of Chinese calligraphy.
Important exhibitions and museum collections.
Zhang's works have been the subject of important international exhibitions including M+ Sigg Collection: Four Decades of Chinese Contemporary Art at ArtisTree, Hong Kong (2016); Light before Dawn: Unofficial Chinese Art 1974–1985 at Asia Society, Hong Kong (2013); Blooming in the Shadows: Unofficial Chinese Art, 1974–1985 at China Institute Gallery, New York, USA (2011).
Zhang's 1984 oil on linen "AC10" was acquired by The Art Institute of Chicago in 2005. In 2016, Hong Kong's M+ Museum of Visual Culture acquired four of his earlier works from mid-1970s and 1980s from Uli Sigg, the renowned Swiss collector of Chinese contemporary art.

Queer Sarajevo Festival 2008

Queer Sarajevo Festival was the first public queer festival in Bosnia and Herzegovina, organized by Organization Q in September 2008 in Sarajevo. The Festival is remembered as the first public coming out of LGBT*IQA persons in BiH. It became the center of interest of Bosnian-Herzegovinian, regional and international public and media after the escalation of violence against Festival participants and journalists on the day of the opening. The Festival was closed for the public two days after its opening, due to counter-reactions of general public, political representatives and as the organizers, journalists and Festival participants had been physically attacked by Islamic religious extremists and nationalists.
About the Festival.
Organization Q is the first organization for the promotion and protection of human rights of queer persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In September 2007 and in line with strategic plan of Organization Q, Organization Q and Sarajevski Otvoreni Centar jointly started planning the first Queer Sarajevo Festival dedicated to LGBTIQ community in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Couple of months after the preparations had started, Sarajevski Otvoreni Centar left the organizational committee, while Organization Q continued with preparatory work on the Festival.
Queer Sarajevo Festival 2008 was about sharing the personal stories of lesbian, gay, transgender, intersex and queer persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina and everyday accounts of love, friendship, social justice struggle, discrimination, freedom, pride and victory. The Festival in itself challenges and questions heteronormative and patriarchal values, particularly those centered around the issues of identity, gender, sexuality and human rights. The goal of the Festival was to increase the visibility of queer culture, theory and movement and to establish the Festival as traditional event of visibility of LGBTIQ community in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Additionally, it was to open the public space for discussions related to queer issues in Bosnia and Herzegovina, LGBTIQ culture, identities and human rights. The opening night was to be on September 24, 2008 at the Academy of Fine Arts in Sarajevo and the Festival would run for five days. The program of the Festival consisted of exhibitions, performances, documentary movie screenings and round table discussions by participants from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the region and wider.
Reactions.
Threats prior to the Festival.
Queer Sarajevo Festival was the first public LGBTIQ event that gained attention of the media, political leaders and general public of BiH. The organizers of Queer Sarajevo Festival were at the forefront receiving death threats during preliminary activities of the Festival. The organizers, including their supporters, media partners and journalists received death threats weeks before the opening. There were debates on the Festival and death threats online as well. Homophobic posters were widely distributed and put in prominent places across Sarajevo, calling for violence against the Festival participants and supporters, containing messages such as Death to faggots!. Similar posters were exhibited in other municipalities as well. Anti-Festival protests were announced at the Square of Alija Izetbegovic in Sarajevo, on the 24th of September 2008. Festival organizers had also received a threatening letter signed by the Union of war veterans of Sarajevo. Amnesty International had already called upon the authorities of BiH to ensure protection for Festival organizers and the Festival itself, on the 18th of September 2008. Organization Q documented all threats and handed over the material to the authorities, demanding the cases be processed.
Media coverage of the Festival.
Staging Sarajevo Queer Festival during Ramadan month was used as an argument for different claims. It was said that such a festival was a direct attack on the religion of Islam, though it had been made clear that the Festival had no religious or anti-religious references and that it was a sole coincidence that the timing of the Festival overlaps with the month of Ramadan. Most notable print media using inflammatory rhetorics were Dnevni Avaz and SAFF. The cover page of the most read daily newspapers Dnevni Avaz, on the 28th of August 2008 featured a headline: "Who is trying to hoax Bosniaks with a gay gathering in Ramadan?" Some other headlines of Dnevni Avaz and SAFF were: "Gays in Sarajevo on Lejletu-l-kadr night!", "Dangerous fiddling with religious feelings of Bosniaks", "Homosexual Festival in holy Ramadan". Alongside the print media, a video was published on YouTube platform, portraying scenes of decapitation of one of the Festival organizers Svetlana Durkovic, positing a direct threat to organizers of Sarajevo Queer Festival. Calls for stoning, lynching and burning the Festival organizers and participants were published on online platforms.
Public reactions of political and religious leaders on the Festival.
Among those who publicly propagated hatred against LGBTIQ persons were also the representatives of the official governing structured in BiH. Some of the politicians and religious leaders have made public statements that have contributed to spreading hatred and discrimination against LGBTIQ persons. Then Parliament member, Bakir Izetbegović has stated: I am not in the least pleased with the holding of the Queer Festival. This reminder of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of the 27th night [of Ramadan], a noble night which Muslims look forward to – I am not at all pleased by that". Izetbegović also said around the time of the Festival that, "They [LGBT people] have a right to their sexual orientation, or rather disorientation, but we will employ all moral means to fight the influence of homosexuality on youth... It’s something that will spread if you let it. It should be done between four walls... The statement of mufti Seid Smajkic was that: "Freedom should not be used for promotion of that Western trash". The statement of Municipality council of Stranka za BiH (The Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina) was: "Ramadan ambient was violated by Queer festival, especially in its final and the most meaningful part of the month when every man, relying on the tradition and the significance of the holy month, will not exert a real reaction." Then member of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Parliament, Amila Alikadić-Husović deemed it inappropriate that "something like that" was being held in the month of Ramadan, adding, "[h]omosexuality is condemned by every religion. Who are we to approve of something that God forbids?"
Attack on Festival participants.
The opening night of the Festival was 24 September 2008, at the Academy of Fine Arts in Sarajevo with about 250 participants. Alongside police forces, Festival organizers hired a public security agency. On the day of the opening a group of about 70 wehabbis and hooligans gathered across Miljacka river bank on the street opposite of the Academy of Fine Arts and started shouting religious paroles and insults to Festival participants, such as: "Allahu Akbar! We will get you! Kill the faggots!". Police forces on site did not respond adequately and prevent that group in coming over to the entry point of the Festival premises. The attackers started throwing stones at the building of the Academy of Fine Arts and followed some of the participants upon their leaving the Festival. They followed them across the city of Sarajevo and physically assaulted them. Eight persons were injured that night: R.K., H.Ć., T.B., A.S., police officer Boban Vujičinović, journalists Peđa Kojović and Emir Imamović as well as a foreign citizen, Andrejs Viskochis.
After the attack, Queer Sarajevo Festival continued with its planned activities on another location but without public gatherings and promotion. Festival organizers continued receiving threats. On September 25, 2008 Dnevni Avaz published the names of injured persons, followed by Oslobođenje and Nezavisne novine. On the same day a YouTube video was published portraying decapitation and death treats targeting Svetlana Đurković as one of the Festival organizers. After the third night of the Festival, the organizers stopped all further activities.
Council of Europe, Amnesty International, embassies of France and USA have all issued press releases condemning the violence on Queer Sarajevo Festival. The Bosnian Presidency did not make any public statements on the threats targeting LGBTIQ population in relation to Queer Sarajevo Festival. However, Damir Arnaut, advisor on constitutional and legal affairs to the Bosniak member of the Presidency and then Chairman Haris Silajdžić, declared his public support to Organization Q, stating that: "Politicians are violating the Constitution of BiH with their homophobic statements."
Legal proceedings.
In total 19 charges have been filed to Police Departments of Centar and Novo Sarajevo in the period between September 4 and October 3, 2008. According to the Official Gazette of BiH, in total three indictments have been made by the Prosecutor's Office. One indictee was sentenced to one year, while at the same time a ruling had been made that the sentence will enter into force if the indictee dos not commit another criminal offense in the following two years. Second indictee was acquitted of all charges, while the third indictee was sentenced to suspended 5-year jail sentence.
Organization Q appealed to Constitutional court of BiH on the bases that authorities in charge failed to ensure adequate measures for protection of their rights guaranteed by the Constitutional court of BiH and European Convention for protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as inefficient investigation, i.e. identification and sanctioning of perpetrators. According to the Official Gazette of BiH, disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against four police officers on November 17, 2008, due to reasonable doubt of a serious breach of official duties. Disciplinary committee found them responsible for the breach and sanctions were stated, while Police committee granted their appeals and freed them from responsibility.
Six years after the appeal was filed, the Constitutional Court of BiH on September 25, 2014, at the 88th plenary session, partially adopted the appeal of the Q Association for the Promotion and Protection of Culture, Identity and Human Rights of Queer persons:
The Press Council in Bosnia and Herzegovina has received an appeal from Organization Q on 11 September 2008 related to the articles published in Dnevni avaz. The Complaints Commission of the Press Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina unanimously concluded that the newspaper Dnevni Avaz violated the Press Code based on the following articles: Article 1 - General Provisions, 3 - Incitement, 4 - Discrimination, 4a - Gender Equality and Respect of Individuality and 15 - Public Interest. The Appeals Commission of the Press Council in BiH has appealed to the editorial board of Dnevni avaz and other newspaper editions in BiH to take into account the democratic value of tolerance and coexistence in this geographical area and to contribute to raising the threshold of tolerance and mutual understanding, while respecting the professional provisions of the Press Code of BiH.
Queer Sarajevo Festival 2008 documentary movie.
In 2009, Organization Q produced a documentary movie "Queer Sarajevo Festival 2008". The movie was part of film festivals in San Francisco, Beijing and Berlinale film festival. The movie was nominated for Best documentary/Essay film Teddy award.
Queer Sarajevo festival 2009 — Festival as any other.
Organization Q organized the second Queer Sarajevo Festival 2009 — Festival as any other. This festival had a different concept and was presented virtually from 24 to 28 September by placing 100 jumbo posters throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, presentation of a video on online platforms and it also featured five-day media presence and messages on TV, radio and newspapers. As a result of QSF 2008, "QSF in a box" was promoted in spring 2009, a collection of 5 DVDs with the content from the first festival.

Tuvan Internationale

The Tuvan Internationale (, ; ) is a socialist song set to a Tuvan traditional melody. It was composed during the Tuvan People's Republic. It is often incorrectly listed as the Tuvan language version of "The Internationale" despite the two songs having almost nothing in common aside from similar names. With a different melody and different lyrics, the only similarity between the two songs is the fact that they are about a Workers' International. Even then, however, The Internationale is about the First International whereas the Tuvan Internationale is about the Third International.
When the revolutions after the First World War came to a close, communists managed to gain power in only three countries: the Soviet Union, Tuva and Mongolia. After the Soviet Union was formed, it adopted The Internationale as its anthem. In honour of this, composers in Tuva and Mongolia created the Tuvan Internationale and Mongol Internationale. The Mongol Internationale later served as the national anthem of Mongolia from 1924 to 1950.
The song was included on the Huun-Huur-Tu album "60 Horses In My Herd. Old Songs And Tunes Of Tuva".

Commissioner of Taxation v La Rosa

Commissioner of Taxation v La Rosa was a 2003 decision of the Federal Court of Australia, sitting as the Full Court of the Federal Court. The court upheld two earlier rulings that Frank La Rosa, a convicted heroin dealer, was entitled to a tax deduction of $220,000 for money stolen from him during a drug deal. As a result of the decision, the federal government amended the "Income Tax Assessment Act 1997" to prevent similar deductions being made.
Background.
In 1996, Francesco Dominico "Frank" La Rosa was sentenced to 12 years in prison for importing heroin and possessing heroin and amphetamines with intent to distribute. He also forfeited property to the value of $264,610 under the "Proceeds of Crime Act 1987". As a result of La Rosa's convictions, it came to the attention of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) that he had failed to lodge tax returns for the seven financial years from 1989–90 to 1995–96. The ATO subsequently issued notices of assessment for those years, based on information provided by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions about La Rosa's activities. His assessed taxable income included both legally and illegally obtained income, as Australian taxation law does not distinguish between the two. His assessed income for the 1994–95 period included a sum of $220,000 cash that had been stolen from him during a botched drug deal. The money "was accumulated from drug dealings and had been buried in the taxpayer's backyard".
Legal process.
La Rosa appealed the inclusion of the $220,000 in his assessable income. Appearing "pro se", he argued that the money had been provided to him by the Australian Federal Police as part of his role in a sting operation, and was thus not income. The Commissioner of Taxation rejected his argument, which La Rosa raised again on appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). The AAT reaffirmed the earlier conclusion that the money should be treated as assessable income, dismissing any notion of police involvement. However, acting "as a matter of procedural fairness as the taxpayer had little tax knowledge and was representing himself", the tribunal concluded that the stolen money met the general deduction provisions in the "Income Tax Assessment Act 1936" (ITAA36), and thus could be deducted from La Rosa's taxable income. The ATO appealed to the Federal Court, where in 2002 Judge Robert Nicholson upheld the AAT's ruling. The Federal Court ruling brought the case to the attention of the public, provoking "an immediate public and political storm". The ATO was subsequently granted leave to appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court.
Final ruling.
The three-member Full Court of the Federal Court upheld the earlier rulings, finding that La Rosa was entitled to deduct the $220,000 in full. The main issue considered by the court was the deductibility of expenses incurred by an illegal business. The leading judgment in the case was given by Justice Peter Hely, who observed:
The purpose of the ITAA is to tax taxable income, not punish
wrongdoing. [...] There should not be a higher burden of taxation imposed on those whose business activities are unlawful than that imposed in relation to lawful business activities. Punishment of those who engage in unlawful activities is imposed by the criminal law, and not by the laws in relation to income tax.
The court first considered whether the sum had correctly been included in La Rosa's assessable income. It noted a substantial precedent that "the illegal nature of a receipt does not deny its taxability", as the ITAA made no distinction between income derived from legal and illegal activities. It therefore upheld the AAT's initial ruling that the $220,000 formed part of La Rosa's assessable income. The court observed that exempting illegally obtained revenue from taxation would "favour dishonest businesses over honest ones". The court also ruled that La Rosa's operations, although illegal, nonetheless constituted a "business" within the ITAA definition.
Section 51(1) of the ITAA allowed taxpayers to deduct losses "incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income", with some exceptions. Section 51(2) specifically allowed for the deduction of "expenditure incurred or deemed to have been incurred in the purchase of stock used by the taxpayer as trading stock". In ruling that the stolen money constituted a "loss", the court applied the 1956 High Court decision in "Charles Moore (WA) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation", where a deduction was allowed for money that had been stolen from a business while being taken to a bank. The cash was stolen from La Rosa "during operations to acquire trading stock" (specifically, a "substantial supply of prohibited drugs"). Because of this, the court upheld the AAT's original decision that the loss had a direct connection with the business operations and therefore fell under the general deduction provisions. As with income, the ITAA did not expressly prohibit deductions for expenses incurred in illegal activities.
The ATO submitted that the court should adopt a "purposive" rather than a literal approach to interpreting the ITAA's deduction provisions, as the ITAA contained sections barring deductions for fines, penalties, and bribes. It argued that, based on these existing "public-policy" exceptions, the unexpressed intent of the legislation was to prohibit deductions relating to illegal activities; the court should consequently read into the legislation an implied prohibition on claiming those deductions. The court rejected this submission on the grounds that a non-literal interpretation of the deduction provisions would be inconsistent with other areas of the ITAA and would cause uncertainty among taxpayers. It stated that it was the role of the legislature to determine public-policy exceptions to the deduction provisions, not that of the courts.
Aftermath.
The ATO sought leave to appeal to the High Court, the final court of appeal in the Australian legal system. In October 2004, the High Court announced that it had refused the appeal. In April 2005, Treasurer Peter Costello announced that the federal government would amend Australian tax law to deny deductions "incurred in the furtherance of, or directly in relation to, activities in respect of which the taxpayer has been convicted of an indictable offence". It did so by adding section 26-54 to the "Income Tax Assessment Act 1997".
In June 2008, La Rosa and his wife Kim were reported missing. Their bodies were found in Chittering, Western Australia, in January 2009, and in 2011 Frank Mikhail and his son Adam were convicted of their murders. They were sentenced to life in prison.

Kalika Mata Temple, New Dhrewad

The Kalika Mata Temple is located at New Dhrewad in Devbhoomi Dwarka district, Gujarat, India.
Location and history.
The temple belongs to Maitraka period (7th century). The temple is one of the two ancient temples located near the village, other being Rajal Vejal Mata temple. The temple is inscribed as the Monument of National Importance (N-GJ-122) by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).
Architecture.
M. A. Dhaky and Nanavati has classified this temple of Vimanakara type due to its "shikhara" (spire) with neo-Dravidic subtype.
The east-facing temple is a "sandhara" (sanctuary with an interior ambulatory) type temple with its adhisthana (base) visible at the few places. The sequence of carvings is as follow: large "padma" (inverted cyma recta), "kusuma", "vajana" ("plank-edge" moulding), "kandhara" (necking), "uttara" (beam), "urdhvapadma" (upper cyma moulding), "kapota" (roll cornice) and "pattika" (plain band). "Padma" is not yet evolved into "Kumbha" (pot) visible in future "Nagara" class temples and "kumuda" are very large and not yet evolved in "kalasha" (urn).
The square cella has plain walls crowned with an "urdhvapadma" with dog tongue carvings and a "kapota". The "shikhara" superstructure has five tiers, each having "chandrashala" carvings in decreasing numbers from five to one. The last tier is flanked by half dormers. It is crowned by an "amlasaraka" ("corrugated wheel" just below the finial) and a "kalasha" which may be added later. There is no deity inside the cella. There are some idols placed inside now.
The "mandapa" hall is closed from sides with plain walls. There is a window at the centre with a "dandachadya" (corrugated hood) and "surasenaka" (trefoil "chaitya" dormer) above it. A band of "rafter’s ends" and a "kapota" runs on the top area of the walls. There are four "bhadraka" (square pillar with recesses) type pillars in the centre. The "mukhamandapa" (entry porch) seems later addition.

Music video.
Lepa Brena has repeatedly said that she has been so blonde for so long that she can not imagine her with another hair color, and in the new video for the song "Kao nova" we can look like a redhead, which fits her perfectly. The singer commented that the red color for her has always been a symbol of love, passion and fire, and adds: "This time, this was our guiding idea when we wanted to introduce the new Lepa Brena. Of course, everyone is asking me whether this is now a new image and whether I will be Burning Flame in the future, so I will disappoint them. Redhead I was only for the needs of the video, I personally stay consistent with my blue hair color."

Leiomodin 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the LMOD1 gene.
Function.
The leiomodin 1 protein has a putative membrane-spanning region and 2 types of tandemly repeated blocks. The transcript is expressed in all tissues tested, with the highest levels in thyroid, eye muscle, skeletal muscle, and ovary. Increased expression of leiomodin 1 may be linked to Graves' disease and thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].

2018 Iran Bombardier Challenger crash

On 11 March 2018, a Bombardier Challenger 604 private jet, owned by Turkish group Başaran Holding, crashed in the Zagros Mountains near Shahr-e Kord, Iran, while returning to Turkey from the United Arab Emirates. All three crew members and eight passengers on board were killed. 
History.
The aircraft, registered TC-TRB, departed from Sharjah International Airport, United Arab Emirates, at around 17:11 local time (13:11 UTC), bound for Istanbul Atatürk Airport. The flight crew consisted of two pilots and a cabin attendant. The Captain had flown for Turkish Airlines in the past, while the First Officer had a military aviation background, and had been one of the first female pilots in the Turkish armed forces.
The aircraft reached a cruising altitude of just over . At around 18:01 IRST local time (14:31 UTC), shortly before contact was lost, the crew reported technical problems and requested clearance from air traffic control to descend to a lower altitude. The jet began to climb before abruptly losing altitude, and at 18:09, hit the Zagros Mountains near Shahre Kord, some south of Tehran, Iran. All eleven occupants were killed. One witness reportedly saw the aircraft on fire before the crash.
Victims.
The jet was carrying a group of eight friends returning from a bachelorette party in Dubai. Among them was Mina Başaran, daughter of the head of Başaran Holding, Hüseyin Başaran, and member of the company's board of directors.
Recovery operations.
Local villagers saw a plume of smoke rising from the wreckage, and were the first to arrive at the scene. Iranian search-and-rescue teams arrived afterwards and found the burned bodies of ten victims. Bad weather conditions at the crash site made the operation difficult. One victim has yet to be found. The recovered bodies were transported to Tehran by helicopter. Turkey then sent emergency personnel via a military jet for assistance. Identification of the bodies required DNA testing.
After identification by the Iranian authorities, the bodies of ten victims were flown to Istanbul by the Turkish military and then handed over to the victims' families. Iranian Legal Medicine Organization stated that the remains of the captain were not among the recovered bodies in the eleven body bags from the wreckage.
Investigation.
The aircraft's two flight recorders (the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder) were recovered for analysis.
In September 2018, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Board of the Iranian civil aviation authority published a preliminary report indicating that, shortly before reaching cruise altitude, a discrepancy between the airspeed indications shown to the two pilots became apparent, with one indicating an overspeed condition. Engine power was reduced, and shortly after the stick-shaker activated. The aircraft subsequently stalled and entered a steep descent during which both engines flamed out. Control was not regained and the aircraft eventually struck a mountainside. In March 2020, the AAIB issued its final report, concluding that the accident was caused by insufficient training for airspeed indication failure and poor crew resource management.

Posthumanization

Posthumanization comprises "those processes by which a society comes to include members other than 'natural' biological human beings who, in one way or another, contribute to the structures, dynamics, or meaning of the society." Posthumanization is one of the key phenomena studied by those academic disciplines and methodologies that identify themselves as "posthumanist", including critical, cultural, and philosophical posthumanism. Its processes can be divided into forms of "non-technological" and "technological" posthumanization.
Technological vs. non-technological posthumanization.
Non-technological posthumanization.
While posthumanization has links with the scholarly methodologies of posthumanism, it is a distinct phenomenon. The rise of explicit posthumanism as a scholarly approach is relatively recent, occurring since the late 1970s; however, some of the processes of posthumanization that it studies are ancient. For example, the dynamics of "non-technological" posthumanization have existed historically in all societies in which animals were incorporated into families as household pets or in which ghosts, monsters, angels, or semidivine heroes were considered to play some role in the world.
Such non-technological posthumanization has been manifested not only in mythological and literary works but also in the construction of temples, cemeteries, zoos, or other physical structures that were considered to be inhabited or used by quasi- or para-human beings who were not natural, living, biological human beings but who nevertheless played some role within a given society, to the extent that, according to philosopher Francesca Ferrando: "the notion of spirituality dramatically broadens our understanding of the posthuman, allowing us to investigate not only technical technologies (robotics, cybernetics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, among others), but also, technologies of existence."
Technological posthumanization.
Some forms of technological posthumanization involve efforts to directly alter the social, psychological, or physical structures and behaviors of the human being through the development and application of technologies relating to genetic engineering or neurocybernetic augmentation; such forms of posthumanization are studied, e.g., by cyborg theory. Other forms of technological posthumanization indirectly "posthumanize" human society through the deployment of social robots or attempts to develop artificial general intelligences, sentient networks, or other entities that can collaborate and interact with human beings as members of posthumanized societies.
The dynamics of technological posthumanization have long been an important element of science fiction; genres such as cyberpunk take them as a central focus. In recent decades, technological posthumanization has also become the subject of increasing attention by scholars and policymakers. The expanding and accelerating forces of technological posthumanization have generated diverse and conflicting responses, with some researchers viewing the processes of posthumanization as opening the door to a more meaningful and advanced transhumanist future for humanity, while other bioconservative critiques warn that such processes may lead to a fragmentation of human society, loss of meaning, and subjugation to the forces of technology.
Common features of technological and non-technological posthumanization.
Processes of technological and non-technological posthumanization both tend to result in a partial "de-anthropocentrization" of human society, as its circle of membership is expanded to include other types of entities and the position of human beings is decentered. A common theme of posthumanist study is the way in which processes of posthumanization challenge or blur simple binaries, such as those of "human versus non-human", "natural versus artificial", "alive versus non-alive", and "biological versus mechanical".

French ship Léopard (1642)

The Léopard was a 28-gun small ship of the line of the French Royal Navy, constructed by the Dutch shipwright Jan Gron (usually called Jean de Werth in French) at the new state dockyard at Île d'Indret near Nantes. She and her sister "Tigre" were two-deckers, but with only a few guns on the upper deck. 
In April 1651 her crew mutinied and handed the ship over to the Spanish at San Lucar.

Cool Nights is a 1991 studio album by American jazz vibraphonist Gary Burton.
Background.
The album was recorded in the Studio A of the Power Station in New York City. In the accompanying booklet the record label explains that Burton's music in this album changed direction. This time Burton wanted to play something closer to music of such famous jazz names as Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, and Carmen McRae. Burton's friend Pat Metheny did not play for this album but wrote four of the eleven songs.

"At the Name of Jesus" is an 1870 hymn with lyrics written by Caroline Maria Noel.
The hymn appears in at least 206 hymnals. It was first published with the Ralph Vaughan Williams tune "King's Weston" in "Songs of Praise", 1925, from Oxford University Press. An Expanded Edition of this hymnal appeared in 1931. This tune was also found in the Episcopal Church's "The Hymnal 1940".
Text.
There are various versions of the text. One example has four verses, with a new verse 2 replacing verses 2-4 and verse 6 starting "Brothers" rather than "Christians". The text below is attributed to Oxford University Press on the Hymnary website.

Ratan Lal Brahmachary

Ratan Lal Brahmachary ( )(1932 - 13 February 2018) was a distinguished biochemist and a pioneer of tiger pheromone studies in India. He was widely known for his research in pheromones, although his academic background based on Physics, specifically on astrophysics under guidance of S.N. Bose. Brahmachary made significant contributions in tiger behavioral studies researching the animal for over 50 years. He studied many species of wildlife, notably big cats and undertook research trips to his favourite continent Africa fourteen times. Brahmachary studied ethology in the Amazon basin in South America and Borneo, Indonesia with an ardent admirer of entomologist Gopal Chandra Bhattacharya.
He once said in an interview
He died in pneumonia on 13 February 2018 in a city Nursing home in Kolkata, India. Brahmachary had pledged his body to medical research. After paiding respect his body was handed over to Radha Govinda Kar Hospital authorities.
Early life and education.
Ratan Lal Brahmachary belongs to Bengali Hindu family. He was born in Dhaka, Bengal, British India (now in Bangladesh ) in 1932.
Professor Brahmachary's early education was in Calcutta, Dacca and Hamburg. He was an astrophysicist. He was a student of the eminent Indian theoretical physicist Satyendra Nath Bose. However, since 1960 he moved into biology, making significant original contributions to molecular embryology, and later, since late 1970s became an ecologist, studying mammalian pheromones, at the Indian Statistical Institute under its founder Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis.
As a biochemist.
Following a decade of work on relativistic field theory Astrophysist, Professor Ratan Lal Brahmachary joined Indian Statistical Institute in 1957 and there he was professor of Biology Department and a veteran on tiger research. He did his extensive research in Marine Biological Labs in Italy, France and other institutes in Europe.
Professor Brahmachary's early work was on molecular embryology of invertebrates, and in the 1970s, during a series of visits to Africa, studied food habits of mountain Gorilla. For more than 30 years since 1979, his major research emphasis was on pheromones of tigers and other big cats. He was interested in Animal Behaviour long before the subject was introduced in this part of the world. To observe wildlife, he visited Africa 14 times. He also worked in the Amazon area and Borneo and in the Mediterranean and Andaman Islands.
Notable works.
On biochemistry.
Tiger pheromones.
He was among the first scientists to observe the scent-marking behaviour of tigers, where the animals spray urine on tree branches to mark their territories and communicate via biochemical messengers. Brahmachary, along with Jyotirmoy Dutta of Bose Institute, Kolkata made the first comprehensive approach towards understanding the nature of big cat pheromones. After Years long researched on Synthesising the chemical nature of tiger urine (marking fluid), he found out that the molecule 2 acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) was present in tiger urine (marking fluid) and was the very same molecule that imparts the beautiful aroma to fragrant varieties of rice like basmati.
Human pheromone.
Professor Brahmachary gave his opinion on human pheromone. In an interview he expressed
Scented and non-scented mung bean.
Mung bean is a widely consumed legume of India as well as of Asia. In India, two varieties of this bean, scented and non-scented, are available. The scented variety produces a beautiful aroma when fried, boiled or cooked. Professor Brahmachari researched on this phenomenon with Moumita Pal and Mahua Ghosh. This study was carried out for comparison of the physicochemical and biochemical characteristics of these two varieties.
On physics.
Professor Brahmachari did a research on 
"Solution of the Combined Gravitational and Mesic Field Equations in General Relativity". Which was published in 1960 in Progress of Theoretical Physics.
Born Free Foundation.
He was one of the founder patron of Zoo Check. Now it is the Born Free Foundation since 1984. Brahmachary always believed that "wildlife belongs in the wild and strongly stood for compassionate treatment of animals in research". About Born free foundation he told in an interview
Books.
He wrote several books in Bangla to promote the cause of wildlife protection and scientific observation of animal behaviour. most notable books are listed below.
His academic book My Tryst With Big Cats is quite popular among tiger studies scholars.
Summary of his last work on tiger phenomenon was published in a book named The Neurobiology of Chemical Communication. This book edited by Carl Mucignat Caretta on 2014.
Award.
For his contributions to science popularisation, he received the coveted state prize of West Bengal Rabindra Puraskar. He also got D.Sc. degree from the University of Calcutta in 2008.

Molgula occidentalis

Molgula occidentalis is a species of marine invertebrate of the family Molgulidae. The scientific name of the species was validated and published for the first time in 1883 by Traustedt. It is a soft-bodied, intertidal ascidian, sac-like filter feeders in the subphylum tunicate characterized by a hard outer covering known as a “tunic,” abundant in the shallow subtidal and intertidal zones of the Northern Gulf of Mexico, where they establish pseudopopulations.
Description.
These ascidians have soft bodies but are covered by a hard, protective tunic as they are part of the subphylum tunicate. They are sessile intertidal organisms. The tunic contains hair like extensions of the epidermis known as ampullae, which are hollow and tubular. Ampullae grow shortly after the larvae settles in the sediments and are used to form a strong attachment to grains of sand. The grains of sand hold it down as the juvenile forms around seven to nine ampullae to create a secure attachment to soft sediments or hard substrates surrounding the organism. Adult "M. occidentalis" cover themselves in a layer of sand and use the ampullae to secure the sand on top of them in order to camouflage and protect them from predators.
Environment.
Molgula occidentalis occupy soft bottoms. They are sessile organisms as juveniles and adults after the larvae settle. The larvae may settle on hard or soft substrates, adhering to rocks, shells, sea grasses, or other ascidians but most often rest on sandy or muddy substrates. Their larvae are pelagic and they lack a tadpole stage because currents carrying them to shores where they settle in the intertidal or subtidal zone and form a temporary pseudopopulation. Because of this, larvae do best in high current systems. These pseudopopulations typically only survive for a short time and are not self-sustaining. They typically settle during the spring and summer months, reach sexual maturity, then die come the winter months as freezing temperatures and prolonged exposure due to low tide have adverse effects on the organisms. They are limited by vertical zonation: adults can inhabit deeper depths but larvae cannot and they are limited by desiccation if they settle to high so they inhabit the edge of pools no more than a few centimeters above or below low tide.
Ecology.
They occur most abundantly in areas where seagrasses, specifically "Ruppia maritima," stabilize the sediments because increased sediments in the water and movement of sediments can have adverse effects on the organisms.
They are preyed upon by the gastropod "Fasciolaria hunteria." This snail inserts its probuscus into a siphon found on the "M. occidentalis" and consumes the ascidian's internal organs, leaving the tunicate untouched.
Reproduction and Life cycle.
Adult "M. occidentalis" are simultaneous hermaphrodites and are capable of self-fertilization. Once fertilized, they have a very short embryonic period, averaging about 12.5 hours under ideal conditions. Ascidian eggs have different cytoplasmic patterns that influence the embryonic tissues and the fate of the blastomeres. The distribution of the cytoplasmic components are produced by the movement of the contents of oocytes during a process known as ooplasmic segregation. Because they are ascidians, they are part of the phylum chordata and have a notochord in the larval stage, but lose it when they metamorphose into adults.

Happiness (Bill Anderson song)

"Happiness" is a song written by American country musician Bill Anderson, and first recorded by Anderson on his 1963 album "Still".
In the United Kingdom, the song is best known in the version by comedian and singer Ken Dodd. Dodd's recording, arranged by Ivor Raymonde and released on EMI's Columbia label, reached number 31 on the UK Singles Chart in 1964.

Cease Fire (short story)

"Cease Fire" is a science fiction short story by Frank Herbert. It was first published in "Astounding Science Fiction" in 1958, and was included in the anthology of notable stories, "A Century of Science Fiction" (1962), edited by Damon Knight. It has also been published as part of later collections of Herbert's best stories, such as "Eye".
Plot.
The story is set in 1972, during a low level war against an unnamed enemy being waged somewhere in the arctic region of the American continent. Both sides have "life detection" technology, that can detect living creatures at a distance. The American side has an electromagnetic shield that can conceal people from the detectors.
Hulser is a scientist conscripted into the army. His wife is expecting their first child. He is manning a forward observation post using detectors and his own shield to spot enemy activity. His detector registers small life forms that may or may not be foxes or wolves. Hulser wonders if the enemy has a shield that merely reduces the apparent size of the person wearing it in the detector. Thinking about his own shield, and need to protect him against chemical reactions it would induce in his body, he realizes that the technology can be used to remotely detonate explosives, giving his side an overwhelming advantage and ending the war. Deciding that the detector is registering enemy soldiers, he calls in a mortar strike and then is embroiled in a full-scale fire fight. Panicking, he spends the rest of his time demanding to be pulled out.
The story describes Hulser's efforts to get out of combat and have his idea taken seriously. Convinced of his cause, he stands up to his sergeant and bullies his commanding officer, earning him a cell in the brig. There he is contacted by a prominent scientist who starts to believe his idea.
Eventually there is a successful demonstration attended by top military officers and a mysterious civilian that they defer to. Although the war will be won, they are strangely pessimistic. In the final scene they explain that although war with explosives is no longer possible, war will continue with even worse weapons, such as chemical poisons and disease agents. They give Hulser a copy of a book, saying that he and his children will need it. It is a copy of the unexpurgated works of "the master of treachery and deceit", Niccolò Machiavelli.

Sicelo Mhlauli

Sicelo Mhlauli (25 May 1949 – 27 June 1985) was a South African anti-apartheid activist, and one of The Cradock Four murdered by the South African police in 1985.
Early life.
Sicelo Mhlauli was born on 25 May 1949 at Emagqomeni Location in Cradock in the Eastern Cape. His family later moved to Lingelihle Township in 1962 to a section called Taptap. His grandfather, Qobose Mhlauli was also a politician and had worked closely with James Calata who was Fort Calata's grandfather and one of the founding members of the South African Native National Congress. Mhlauli went to St James Primary, Cradock Bantu Secondary and finally studied teaching at Lovedale College where he majored in Afrikaans and History.
Work.
Mhlauli’s teaching career started in 1974 at Thembalabantu High School in King William's Town where he also became boarding master. In 1975, the hostel students embarked on a food strike, demanding better quality food. The student leaders were arrested and during their appearance, Mhlauli would be in court to show his support. The security police opposed Mhauli’s actions because they believed the students were arrested for disturbing the education system. He then went to work as a principal at Archie Velile Secondary in Dimbaza. During a student stay-away demanding proper representation in the student council and equal education in South Africa for both black and white students; some students were assaulted by the police. Mhlauli then took the injured to a nearby clinic; this act was also opposed by the security police.
Politics.
Mhlauli met ex-political prisoner Msuthu Sonkwala who was from Cradock but not allowed to live there by the government due to his banning conditions after he was released from prison. Mhlauli held political meetings with Sonkwala and other ex-political prisoners. They would discuss politics and ways to mobilise the community and teach them about the current political status. Their aim was to get the community involved in protests against the injustices that were brought by the apartheid government.
Mhlauli then received a post as a principal at a high school in Bongolwethu Township in Oudtshoorn. During this time, he married Nombuyiselo Zonke who was also from Cradock and they had two children together named Ntsika and Babalwa. In August 1983, he attended the launch of the United Democratic Front (South Africa) as part of the Oudtshoorn delegation. Soon after this, they formed the Oudtshoorn Civic Organisation and the Bhongolwethu Youth Organisation. His house became the operation centre for struggle advancement in the Southern Cape Region. His wife became part of a collective of women who championed the establishment of the women’s organisation in their region. A newsletter named Saamstaan (stand together) was established, and Mhlauli was part of the committee which established the publication. This publication informed the public about political events in South Africa. It is believed that Mhlauli survived an arson attack at his office that destroyed all of his belongings, however details regarding this event are scarce.
Death and memory.
During winter school holidays, Mhlauli met with Matthew Goniwe who encouraged him to attend a UDF meeting in Port Elizabeth on the 27th of June 1985, which Mhlauli agreed to. On the 26th of June, the community at Lingelihle and surrounding areas held Freedom Charter celebrations and different organisations which affiliated with the UDF, gave speeches. Mhlauli attended the event as a member of the Oudtshoorn Civic Organization which was affiliated with the UDF
On the 27th of June, the four men now referred to as The Cradock Four, went to a UDF meeting in Port Elizabeth. Mhlauli's had been at a course in PE and he had planned to pick her up on their way home. This however did not materialise as their meeting went on until late in the evening. 
The men were last seen at that meeting. Mhlauli’s body was the second to be found after Sparrow Mkhonto in a bush near Bluewater Bay. He was handcuffed and tied with a rope with 25 stab wounds to his chest, seven in the back and another four in his arms. His throat was cut and his right hand severed; and his body was burned. The Cradock Four were buried at a mass funeral where thousands of people attended on the 20th of July 1985. Speakers at the funeral included Beyers Naudé, Allan Boesak and Steve Tshwete gave keynote addresses. A message from the then president of the ANC Oliver Tambo was read.
To honour him, Mhlauli was awarded the Order of Luthuli in Silver by the Presidency of South Africa. The order was for his “Outstanding contribution and dedicating his life to a free, just and democratic South Africa”.

Christian Titz

Christian Titz (; born 1 April 1971) is a German professional football manager and former player who is the manager of 1. FC Magdeburg. Besides coaching, Titz has published several specialised books on football training methods.
During his active career, he most notably played for 2. Bundesliga for SV Waldhof Mannheim in the mid-1990s before ending his playing career in the Regionalliga for SC Idar-Oberstein in 2000. He then embarked on a coaching career, managing the youth teams of several clubs between 2000 and 2006 and again 2009, as well as amateur clubs while at the same time working for the United States Soccer Federation. From 2011 to 2014, Titz coached FC 08 Homburg in the Regionalliga Südwest before joining Hamburger SV in 2015, initially taking over the U17-team and later the reserve team. From 13 March 2018, he was head coach of the Hamburger SV first team before being dismissed on 23 September 2018. Prior to the 2019–20 season he joined Regionalliga club Rot-Weiss Essen but was dismissed after one season after failing to reach play-off promotions.
Playing career.
Titz started playing for local club FC Viktoria Neckarhausen, and later SV Sandhausen as a junior player. He began his senior career at his first club, Viktoria Neckarhausen, and would later go on to play for SG Egelsbach and SV Waldhof Mannheim before finishing his career at SC Idar-Oberstein, for whom he made six appearances during the 1999–2000 season in the third tier Regionalliga West/Südwest.
Managerial career.
Beginnings.
Upon his retirement as an active player, Titz was appointed as coach of the Alemannia Aachen U19-team prior to the 2000–01 season. He worked as a coach in Aachen for four years, and acquired his professional coaching license in December 2004. In November 2005, he was appointed as head coach of fifth tier Bayernliga side 1. FC Passau, but could not save the club from relegation to the Landesliga Bayern and was sacked in August 2006. Titz then started a scouting network in Europe for the United States Soccer Federation.
For the 2000–01 season, Titz took over the first team as well as the U19 team of SCB Viktoria Köln, playing in the fifth tier Mittelrheinliga and the Under 19 Bundesliga, respectively. He was released from his duties at the end of December 2009.
Titz was then appointed as head coach of fifth tier Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar team FC 08 Homburg ahead of the 2011–12 season, leading them to the division championship and promotion to the fourth tier Regionalliga. In the subsequent seasons, 2012–13 (14th) and 2013–14 (11th), he was able to establish the team in the division. In April 2014, Titz left the club.
Hamburger SV.
Starting from the 2015–16 season, Titz was put in charge of the U17-side of Hamburger SV playing in the "B-Junioren Bundesliga" (Under 17 Bundesliga) for two seasons. For the 2017–18 season, he took over the fourth tier Regionalliga Nord reserve team, Hamburger SV II. Gaining 40 points from 17 games, the reserves became autumn "Herbstmeister".
On 13 March 2018, Titz left the reserves after leading them to first place in the table with 45 points from 20 matches, and took over Bernd Hollerbach's first team, struggling in the bottom-end of the Bundesliga with seven points behind in the relegation battle. He initially signed a contract until the end of the 2017–18 season. After gaining ten points from seven games, HSV under Titz were able to reduce the gap to the relegation place before the last matchday to two points. Despite a win on the last match day, HSV suffered relegation from the Bundesliga for the first time in its history on 12 May 2018. Before the last matchday, him and the club had agreed on a contract extension, keeping him at the club independent of the team's ability to stay in the Bundesliga. Due to a positive change in performance, style of play, and the infusion of younger players such as Tatsuya Ito and Matti Steinmann, who had started the season in the reserves, Titz received praise.
On 16 May 2018, Titz signed a contract with HSV, keeping him at the club until 2020. The team would go on to lose their opening game 3–0 at home in the 2. Bundesliga matchup against Holstein Kiel. After four out of the next four matches, HSV were first in the league table. Afterwards, they lost 5–0 at home to SSV Jahn Regensburg, which tied their biggest home loss in club history (equalled 5–0 to Bayern Munich in 1974, to Saint-Étienne in 1980 and again to Bayern Munich in 2014). The following four games only resulted in one win and three goalless draws, including in the "Hamburger Stadtderby" against FC St. Pauli. On 23 October 2018, Titz was sacked, leaving the club at 5th place in the league table, two points behind first place. He was replaced by Hannes Wolf. Director of football Ralf Becker stated afterwards, that the HSV directors had come to the conclusion that the team went in the wrong direction with regards to development, which had meant an increased risk of missing the season goals.
Rot-Weiss Essen.
Ahead of the 2019–20 season, Titz took over as head coach of fourth tier Regionalliga club Rot-Weiss Essen as the successor to Karsten Neitzel, who had been released from his duties after an 8th place finish in the previous season. Titz signed a contract keeping him at the club until 2021. Essen ended the season prematurely in June, after the Regionalliga was cancelled due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. They finished third in the table and thus missed the goal of participation in promotion play-offs for the 3. Liga; something club management had initially aimed for. As a result, the contract, which was still valid for one year, was terminated at the end of the season.
1. FC Magdeburg.
He was appointed as the new head coach of 1. FC Magdeburg on 12 February 2021.
Outside football.
Titz is a trained administrative assistant and state-certified business economist. He is the owner of the service provider "Coaching Zone", which was founded by Thomas Dooley under the name Dooley Soccer University and offers, among other things, individual training. Customers included Lewis Holtby and Christoph Moritz. Together with Dooley, Titz has published several specialised publication, focusing on several aspects of football.

Brian William Robinson

 Brian William Robinson was the second last person executed in Western Australia at Fremantle Prison, on 24 January 1964. On 9 February 1963 Robinson shot and killed police constable Noel Isles, who had attended a domestic incident. Robinson fled to the Gnangara Pine Plantation, causing one of the biggest manhunts in Western Australia's history.
Incident.
Isles, though going off duty at the time, had responded to a phone call to the Belmont police station about a domestic argument. The incident between Robinson and his father occurred because Robinson had heard a rumour that his mother was also his sister. As Isles arrived and entered the front gate he was shot by Robinson from a front window. Robinson then went outside and shot Isles again before fleeing. Robinson tried to get into another car and wrestled with a passenger, Andrew McDougall, who tried to prevent the attempt. Robinson stepped back from the car and fatally shot him. Robinson then flagged down a passing taxi and forced the driver to take him to the Gnangara Pine Plantation, where the car was abandoned after becoming bogged.
Search.
The taxi was found along with its driver shortly afterwards. Police continued to search, and every police officer, whether on duty or not, was called into the area. The search continued into the evening with help from the Royal Australian Air Force, who brought in mobile search light units. At 9pm the search was called off, with a cordon around the area maintained overnight, and all police officers were instructed to report in at 3am.

Legislative elections in South Korea

Legislative elections in South Korea determine the composition of the National Assembly for the next four years.
Any South Korean citizen over the age of 25 is eligible to stand for election. And, under the terms of the Public Official Election Act, the active electoral right, that is, the right to vote is vested in every South Korean citizen who has reached the age of 18. There are certain restrictions, which are mostly the same for both the active and passive electoral rights. The only difference is that to be eligible to stand for election, a person who has been convicted of a crime must have their convictions expunged.)
Procedure.
Since the promulgation of the March 1988 electoral law, the assembly has been elected every four years through a Supplementary Member system, meaning that some of the members are elected from constituencies according to the system of first past the post, while others are elected at a national level through proportional representation. As of 2016, 253 members represent constituencies, while 47 were elected from PR lists. In contrast to elections to the Assembly, presidential elections occur once every five years, and this has led to frequent situations of minority government and legislative deadlock.
Election campaign.
The election campaign period, as set by the Election Law, is short – 14 days. According to the book "Internet Election Campaigns in the United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan", the election campaign periods in Korea (23 days for presidential elections and 14 days for National Assembly elections) were made intentionally short in order to "prevent excessive campaign spending for long-running election campaigns and harmful effects from overheated elections", but, on the downside, "this works against new candidates who are not well known".
Summary of past legislative elections.

On the Run II Tour

The On the Run II Tour was the second co-headlining stadium tour by American singer Beyoncé and rapper Jay-Z. The tour was officially announced on March 12, 2018, and began on June 6, 2018 in Cardiff. It concluded on October 4, 2018 in Seattle. This is their first tour together since On the Run Tour in 2014.
On May 31, it was announced via Twitter that R&amp;B duo Chloe x Halle and DJ Khaled would be the opening acts for the North American leg of the tour.
Following the show in London on June 16, 2018, the pair released their collaborative album "Everything Is Love" exclusively on Tidal. The news of the duo's new album was announced by a showing of the music video for its lead single, "Apeshit", followed by a sign on stage which announced "ALBUM OUT NOW”. The release was then shared on the artists' respective Instagram and Facebook profiles with the artist of the album being dubbed as The Carters. On the same day, the music video for "Apeshit", was released on Beyoncé's official YouTube channel.
Commercial performance.
"Billboard" stated the tour could double the On the Run Tour's gross, predicting it could gross between $180 million and $200 million, if the success of the previous tour is replicated.
Following the first day of general sale, an extra show was added in Amsterdam, after the first date sold out within an hour, as well as in Paris, Landover, East Rutherford, Chicago, Atlanta, Houston, Pasadena and London. Newly added shows were also announced on March 20, in Columbus, Columbia, Seattle, and London.
Billboard ranked On the Run II Tour as the 3rd-highest-grossing tour of the year, selling over 2,177,049 tickets and grossing over $253 million.
Critical response.
The opening show in Cardiff received positive reviews. Mark Sutherland from "Rolling Stone" gave the opening show in Cardiff a positive review. He called it a sort of reaffirmation of dominance for the pair as they deliver a "a hits-packed, visually stunning show". Writing for "The Guardian", Rachel Aroesti awarded the concert four out of five stars and noted that the concept of the show revolved around the singers showing the "deathless nature of their love rather than its perfection". Beyoncé was critiqued after some of her "biggest hits" were left out of the set list on the opening night, including "Halo" and "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". However, with over 60 songs rehearsed for the tour, the set list was believed to change between shows.
Bonginkosi Tshabalala of "No Name" publications added that the show at Houston proved that "no matter what happens LOVE wins".
