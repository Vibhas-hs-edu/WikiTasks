Radioactive (film)

Radioactive is a 2019 British biographical drama film written by Jack Thorne, directed by Marjane Satrapi and starring Rosamund Pike as Marie Curie. The film is based on the 2010 graphic novel "Radioactive: Marie &amp; Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout" by Lauren Redniss.
The film premiered as the Closing Night Gala at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was scheduled to be released in theatres in 2020 but its opening was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was released digitally in the United Kingdom on 15 June 2020 by StudioCanal and released on streaming by Amazon Studios on Amazon Prime Video in the United States on 24 July 2020.
Synopsis.
In 1934, Marie Curie collapses in her laboratory in Paris. As she is rushed to the hospital, she remembers her life. In 1893 she was frequently rejected for funding due to her gender but entered a partnership with Pierre Curie. After Marie discovered polonium and radium, the two fell in love, were married, and had two children. Soon, Marie announces the discovery of radioactivity, revolutionizing physics and chemistry. Radium is soon used in a series of commercial products. Pierre takes Marie to a seance where radium is used to attempt to contact the dead, but Marie disapproves of spiritualism and the idea of an afterlife after the death of her mother in Poland.
Although Pierre rejects the "Légion d'honneur" for not nominating Marie and insists that the two jointly share their Nobel Prize in Physics, Marie becomes agitated that he accepted the Prize in Stockholm without her. Soon afterwards Pierre becomes increasingly sick with anemia as a result of his research and is trampled to death by a horse. Although she initially dismisses concerns that her elements are toxic, increasing numbers of people die from serious health conditions after exposure to radium. Depressed, she begins an affair with her colleague Paul Langevin. Although she receives Pierre's professorship at the Sorbonne, the French nationalist press reports the details of her affair with Langevin and she is harassed by xenophobic mobs due to her Polish origins. She returns to the house where she attended the seance and tearfully begs a woman who was there to try to use radium to contact Pierre. When she receives a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911, she defies the committee's instructions not to travel to Stockholm and is greeted enthusiastically.
In 1914, when World War I starts, her daughter Irene convinces her to run an X-ray unit on the Western Front in order to determine whether or not amputation is needed for wounded soldiers; they fund the X-ray diagnostic units by selling her gold Nobel Prize medals to the government. Irene begins dating Frederic Joliot, but Marie disapproves of their relationship because they have been researching artificial radioactivity and warns Irene not to see him or research radioactivity any more. Although she refuses to obey her, they go to the Western Front together to run the X-ray machine.
Scenes of her life are interwoven with scenes depicting the future impact of her discoveries, including external beam radiotherapy at a hospital in Cleveland in 1956, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a nuclear bomb test in Nevada in 1961, and the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. As she dies in 1934, she sees visions of these events before awakening in a hospital room. Pierre arrives and they leave the hospital together. The film concludes by stating that the Curies' mobile unit X-rayed more than a million men during the war "saving countless lives", that their research would be used to create radiotherapy, and that the Joliot-Curies would discover artificial radioactivity in 1935.
The movie ends with Marie Curie's photo at the 1927 Solvay Conference.
Production.
Development.
It was announced in February 2017 that Marjane Satrapi would direct a biopic on the life of Marie Curie, with StudioCanal and Working Title Films serving as producers. An "autumn 2017" production start was initially foreseen. In May 2017, during the Cannes Film Festival, Rosamund Pike was cast as Curie.
Filming.
In February 2018, Amazon Studios acquired the US distribution rights to the film, with filming beginning in the Hungarian cities of Budapest and Esztergom the same week. The cast was rounded out by Sam Riley, Anya Taylor-Joy, Aneurin Barnard and Simon Russell Beale a few days later.
Release.
"Radioactive" premiered as the Closing Night Gala at the Toronto International Film Festival on 14 September 2019. To celebrate International Women's Day, the film's UK premiere took place at the Curzon Mayfair Cinema on 8 March 2020, ahead of its intended 20 March theatrical release, which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. StudioCanal eventually released the film in the United Kingdom on digital platforms on 15 June 2020 and through video on demand on 6 July, followed by a DVD release on 27 July. In the United States, where the film was originally set to be released theatrically on 24 April 2020 by Amazon Studios, it was released straight to Amazon Prime Video on 24 July 2020.
Reception.
Critical response.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 63% based on 153 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The website's critics consensus reads: ""Radioactive"s flawed script and counterproductive storytelling choices are offset by Rosamund Pike's central performance in a sincere tribute to a brilliant scientific mind." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
Deborah Young of "The Hollywood Reporter" praised Pike's performance, the pacing and the treatment of the subject. "The Independent" gave it two stars and criticised the "on-the-nose writing that sucks the air out of every scene, as characters ceremoniously announce the film's themes and their personal motivations." Charles Bramesco of "The Guardian" panned the film as "by-the-numbers", criticising the script and direction, and gave it one star out of five. Kate Taylor of "The Globe and Mail" concluded that "the viewer may decide [Marie would] rather read a comic book."
Controversy.
Although the film is actually based on a 2010 graphic novel, it is marketed as a "biopic" on Marie Curie. Geraldine McGinty of Cornell University severely criticised the film not just for altering many historical events for dramatic effect, but for misrepresenting her character and that of her husband, e.g. by saying that she stayed home rather than attending the 1905 Nobel ceremony with Pierre, where he belatedly delivered the lecture for their 1903 prize. McGinty said that its misleading analogies, misrepresentation of principal characters, and inappropriate nudity and violence, all make it unsuitable as an educational or biographical source.

Milton P. Webster

Milton Price Webster (1887-1965) was an American trade unionist, best remembered as the first Vice-President of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP) and leader of its Chicago division. As the union's lead negotiator, Webster was influential in securing a collective bargaining agreement with the Pullman Company — the first national contract won by any black-led American trade union.
During the years of World War II, Webster was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a member of the Fair Employment Practice Committee and its successor commission, working to end racial discrimination in the defense industry. Their work helped open access to jobs for black workers, desegregating the work forces in industries with federal contracts that supplied the war effort.
Webster also later served as a member of the International Board of the American Federation of Labor.
Biography.
Early years.
Milton Price Webster was born on April 23, 1887, in Clarksville, Tennessee. His father, Willis, was a barber and owned land in Clarksville with a small farm. His mother Mary was the daughter of freed black Tennesseans (Julia (Donaldson) and Robert Fogg). Both of Mary’s parents attended a fledgling Fisk University at its inception, and her father fought for the Union Army in the Civil War.
Willis and Mary Webster moved with their family from Tennessee to the booming metropolis of Chicago when Milton was a young child. The move was forced by southern nationalist backlash against freedmen and women post Reconstruction, with threats and actions that induced financial hardship, beatings, and the hangman's noose for many Black residents across the South. The Webster family was not immune to these threats and attacks. The family was of humble beginnings, but very close. His mother Mary and father Willis, along with his maternal grandmother Julia Donaldson Fogg and his siblings, moved to a segregated south side of Chicago. It was a large close family of which Milton was the third youngest of 11 children. One of Milton’s earliest memories was of his witnessing of the Pullman Strike in 1894 first hand from his parents tenement apartment window, as white railroad strikers where beaten and shot by US Marshals and US Army Troops. This affected Milton immensely. In later years he would lament that if US troops would treat white union organizers so heinously, he could only imagine what they would do to black union men.
Although Milton was an excellent student and a voracious reader, with a desire to pursue the study of law, the family did not have the resources to send him to the University. He had may odd jobs, eventually obtaining work as a Pullman porter, a job which he held for nearly 18 years. He left the job in April 1924 following a dispute with an official of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railroad, for which he worked. This passion for law would serve him well in his vocation as a labor organizer.
As a porter Webster appreciated first hand the injustices levied upon the worker, the excessive work days on the rail, poor pay, burdensome tolls and fees, undue and uneven disciplinary actions against porters and maids, the weeks and months of being on the rail with no time off, the unsafe work conditions, the lack of any workers rights or advocacy, and the overt racism faced day in and day out by fellow porters and maids. While still employed as a porter, Webster decided that a Labor Union was what was needed for black workers and he, with a few others, began organizing. The Pullman company got wind of his actions and began citing him for disciplinary actions, while trying to force him to disband his efforts, quit, or be fired. Milton quit, but continued organizing porters to form a union to advocate for workers rights for Pullman porters and maids.
After leaving the railroad, Webster took a job as an assistant bailiff at the Chicago Municipal Court, later working for the Republican Party as a political functionary in that same city.
He married Louie Elizabeth Harris of Cassopolis, MI, and they had three children, Milton Price II (JD), Rebecca Estelle, and Jean.
Civil Rights work.
On June 25, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802, prohibiting racial discrimination in the defense industry and establishing the Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC). Roosevelt was pushed into action by head of the BSCP A. Philip Randolph, who had been instrumental in organizing the March on Washington Movement (MOWM), which had planned to demonstrate in the nation's capital later in 1941 unless action to end racial discrimination was taken.
Webster, a key organizer of the March on Washington Movement [MOWM] leading its powerful Chicago headquarter, helped MOWM emerged as a national mass movement for jobs and justice for black Americans during World War II. MOWM was part of a multi‐generational struggle of black people working for fair and full employment, better wages, union protection...racial fairness under law, political representation, fair housing, education, health care and other social wages, access to parks and similar public amenities, and urban development policies geared toward black communal preservation – in short, a minimum program for full citizenship and self‐determination.[8]
The National Committee of the March on Washington Movement, expecting that the FEPC would be largely involved with trade union affairs and thus needed an effective and experienced negotiator, selected Milton Webster as their nominee and he was duly appointed to the committee.
In the context of relatively weak traditional political power, MOWM was in the vanguard of a wartime trend in which the number of African Americans in defense industries rose from 8.4 percent to 12.5 percent. Randolph and Webster recognized that E.O. 8802 and FEPC were far from adequate implements to annihilate racial inequality, but it was understood that this was the most Roosevelt was prepared to offer.[9]
The FEPC would hold a series of public hearings on racial discrimination in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York City, and Birmingham, Alabama but suffered from a lack of support from the White House for perceived overreach in attempting to end racial discrimination across all government agencies. In an effort to dodge potential racial conflict and its political ramifications, in July Roosevelt moved the FEPC from independent status under Presidential supervision to the direction of the War Manpower Commission, headed by Paul V. McNutt.
Only through the concerted pressure of black leaders would Roosevelt be forced to return the committee to the Executive office from the War Department. Roosevelt's signing of Executive Order 9346 in May 1943 restructured the FEPC as the President's Committee on Fair Employment (remembered to historians as the "Second President's Committee"). Webster's talent and worth in the position was recognized as he was the only person from the original FEPC retained on the 7-member committee following its 1943 reorganization.
Death and legacy.
Milton Webster died unexpectedly at the Americana Hotel in Bar Harbour, Florida while attending an AFL-CIO convention with A. Philip Randolph in 1965. He was survived by his wife of over 40 years Louie Elizabeth (Harris) Webster formerly of Cassopolis, Michigan, and three children Milton II (Jean Young), Rebecca (Harry Kingslow, MD), and Jean; and 7 grandchildren Milton Webster(III), Steven Webster, Margot Webster Jones(JD), Marcia Kingslow, Janet Webster, Harry Kingslow(II), and Leslie Kingslow(MD).

US Lusitanos Saint-Maur

Union Sportive Luistanos Saint-Maur or US Lusitanos Saint-Maur is a French football club based in Saint-Maur-des-Fossés. The club was founded in 1966 by Portuguese immigrants who worked in a factory in the town. They play their games at the Stade Adolphe-Chéron. They have twice reached the Championnat National, the third level of French football, and in 2002 they reached the round of 16 in the Coupe de France.
As of the 2017–18 season, the club plays in Championnat National 2, the fourth level of French football.
History.
US Lusitanos Saint-Maur was founded in 1966 by José Lebre, amongst the Portuguese immigrant community in the town of Saint-Maur-des-Fossés. Initially the club consisted entirely of first generation Portuguese, but before long it needed to recruit second generation immigrants with French nationality in order to expand.
In 1975 Armand Lopes, one of the sponsors of the club, took over and set goals for the club to rise up to the national leagues within five years. This took longer than planned, but they arrived in the newly formed National 3 in 1993, as champions of the Division d'Honneur in the Paris region. They gained promotion to National 2 the following season, and two seasons later reached Championnat National the highest amateur division in the country.
After finishing fourth at the first attempt, the club moved up and down between the Championnat National and Championnat de France Amateur, as National 2 had now become. In the 2001–02 season, back in the Championnat National, they reached the last 16 of the Coupe de France, beating Ligue 1 side Girondins de Bordeaux in the round of 32.
They suffered another relegation back to the CFA in 2002, and due to a failed merger with US Créteil-Lusitanos and failure to properly register the team, they were administratively relegated to the Division Supérieure Régionale of the Paris region, effectively level seven of French football. They remained in regional football for more than a decade. In 2012 Arthur Machado was elected as president, restructuring the club.
The club gained promotion again to Championnat de France Amateur 2 (level 5) in 2015 and to the CFA in 2016.
Current squad.

Six Wakes

Six Wakes is a science fiction mystery novel by Mur Lafferty. It was first published in trade paperback and ebook by Orbit Books in January 2017.
Summary.
The "Dormire" is a starship carrying thousands of prospective colonists from Earth to Artemis, a planet in the Tau Ceti star system. All the passengers are in coldsleep; only a six-person crew of cloned former criminals remains awake through the generations-long journey, each of them recloned and reimprinted with their continually updated memories as they age and die.
But something has gone wrong. The latest clone of crew member Maria Arena awakens twenty-five years into the voyage to discover her most recent self, and those of the rest of the crew, murdered, and her accumulated memories of the whole trip wiped. The new clones of the other crew members prove equally amnesiac as they awaken, and IAN, the ship's guiding artificial intelligence, has been crippled and is taking the starship off course.
The crew of the "Dormire" has a mystery and crisis to resolve—who has murdered their previous selves and sabotaged the voyage, and how can they get things back on track? For all they know, the culprit could be any one of them. Suspects include Captain Katrina de la Cruz, pilot and navigator Akihiro Sato, security chief Wolfgang, engineer Paul Seurat, ship's doctor Joanna Glass—and Maria herself.
Awards.
"Six Wakes" was a preliminary nominee for the 2017 BSFA Award for Best Novel and a finalist for the 2018 Philip K. Dick Award, the 2018 Hugo Award for Best Novel, and the 2018 Nebula Award for Best Novel.
Reception.
The reviewer for "Kirkus Reviews" seems puzzled by the author's "venture into science-fiction horror" after her "hilarious" earlier novel "The Shambling Guide to New York City", opining "[y]ou have to wonder why, given Lafferty's manifest talent for humor, she didn't simply play it for laughs." The initial setup is rated "familiar to mystery fans" and "[m]aybe ... just too devious for its own good." Moreover, "the narrative never quite lives up to [its] remarkable opening. Momentum dissipates amid frequent pauses to belabor the cloning process and laws relating to clone succession, not to mention a succession of scientific howlers ... Still, as the characters delve separately and together into their previous lives in search of an explanation for their predicament, the tension rises, personalities are revealed, and common factors emerge—some of them, we learn, are retired, recovering, or repurposed homicidal maniacs." In summation, the reviewer concedes that "readers easily captivated and not overly concerned with structural dependability will find much to entertain them."
"Publishers Weekly" calls the novel "a tense nail-biter of a story fueled by memorable characters and thoughtful worldbuilding" that "explores complex technological and moral issues in a way that’s certain to earn it a spot on award ballots."
Emily Compton-Dzak, writing in "Booklist", finds the book "a perfect blend of science fiction and mystery, complete with Clue-like red herrings and thought-provoking philosophizing about the slippery slope of cloning technology." She calls it "[h]ighly recommended for "Firefly" fans and fans of a good mystery."
Megan M. McArdle in "Library Journal" writes "Lafferty ... delivers the ultimate locked-room mystery combined with top-notch sf worldbuilding. The puzzle of who is responsible for the devastation on the ship keeps the pages turning."
LaShawn M. Wanak in "Lightspeed" likens the novel to "a mash-up of "The Thing" and "Clue"" that "shines best when focusing on its mystery and thriller aspect," noting that "Lafferty does a good job of creating an atmosphere of tension and paranoia as the crew tries to figure out who the murderer is." She feels "[t]here is some infodumping, but I found it fascinating; [Lafferty] could easily write two or three books based on the ethics of cloning." Wanak praises the cast of characters as "delightfully diverse" but finds the ending "a little too neat, and ethically troubling, in light of all the focus that is put on clones and humans being treated well."
The novel was also reviewed by Amy Goldschlager in "Locus" no. 675, April 2017.

Invisible Oranges

Invisible Oranges is an international online music magazine dedicated to heavy metal news, band interviews and album reviews. It was founded by Cosmo Lee in September 2006 shortly after he moved from San Francisco, California, United States to Berlin, Germany. "Invisible Oranges" was acquired by American news company "BrooklynVegan" in January 2013.
History.
Background.
Cosmo Lee started "Invisible Oranges" in September 2006 as a repository for his articles published by other magazines, such as "PopMatters", "Decibel", "Stylus" and "Metal Injection". Lee had recently moved from San Francisco, California to Berlin, Germany and published all of the articles in English. The website's first article was a scathing review of Voodoocult's debut "Jesus Killing Machine", published on October 6, 2006. 
On September 24, 2011, after five years of running the blog, Lee stepped down as editor-in-chief of "Invisible Oranges", but retained ownership of the domain. The announcement was made six months earlier, on March 21, 2011, at which time Lee invited new writers to apply as editors and contributors. On August 26, 2011, Lee posted a second and final recruitment offer for editors, text editors, art directors, gatekeepers, calendar managers and writers. Lee has since gone on to become associate director of direct response at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. 
Michael Nelson replaced Lee as editor-in-chief in September 2011 and remained in that position for the next nine months. Aaron Lariviere replaced Nelson as editor-in-chief in May 2012 but only lasted a brief eight months. Nelson and Lariviere were both contributing writers at "Stereogum" during their time at "Invisible Oranges".
Acquisition by "BrooklynVegan".
In December 2012, Lariviere announced his departure from "Invisible Oranges", leading Lee to consider shutting down the website. Instead, "BrooklynVegan" writer Fred Pessaro offered to take the editor-in-chief position at "Invisible Oranges". On January 4, 2013, "Invisible Oranges" officially joined the "BrooklynVegan" family as its fourth blog, behind "BrooklynVegan", "BV Chicago" and "BV Austin". "Invisible Oranges"' domain name was immediately transferred from Lee to "BrooklynVegan"'s owner and founder David Levine.
Pessaro left "Invisible Oranges" after only nine months as editor-in-chief, in September 2013. He has since gone on to write for "Noisey" and "Revolver". Doug Moore (vocalist in death metal band Pyrrhon) replaced Pessaro in September 2013. Moore restructured the executive department, adding to the team Vanessa Salvia as assistant editor, Wyatt Marshall as deputy editor and Kelly Kettering as director of promotions Moore, however, only remained editor-in-chief for eight months and, like many of his former editors-in-chief, has gone on to write for "Stereogum". Ian Chainey replaced Moore as editor-in-chief in April 2014 for another short eight months. Joseph Schafer replaced Chainey as editor-in-chief in November 2014 and honored that position for two years and eight months; the longest time an editor-in-chief remained in that position since Lee.
Wyatt Marshall left the deputy editor position in August 2014 but the role was not taken over by anyone else; Marshall also went on to write from "Stereogum". Vanessa Salvia and Kelly Kettering both left "Invisible Oranges" in February 2017, at the same time as Ian Cory and Jon Rosenthal became executives. Cory acted as second editor-in-chief, simultaneously with Schafer, until the later's departure in July 2017; while Rosenthal was made an associate editor. Schafer went on to write for "Decibel", "Noisey", Bandcamp's "Bandcamp Daily" column, as well as co-host "The Human Instrumentality" podcast with Cory. Andrew Rothmund became copy editor in July 2017; he was later promoted to editor-in-chief in January 2019 when Cory departed after one year and eleven months in the position. Rothmund has since become the third-longest-running editor-in-chief, behind Lee and Schafer, with almost two years in the position. Rosenthal was promoted to senior editor in February 2020.

Sant'Eframo Nuovo Friary

Sant'Eframo Nuovo Friary was a Capuchin friary in Naples, Italy. It is named after saint Efremus and was sited on via Matteo Renato Imbriani in the Materdei rione. It was founded in 1572 on a site belonging to Gianfrancesco Di Sangro, prince of Sansevero, given to the monks by the Neapolitan noblewoman Fabrizia Carafa. The monastery church was founded in 1661, but the monastery was suppressed in 1886 as part of the anti-clerical policy of the new Kingdom of Italy.

The society was formed when visiting American cinematographer Lester Schorr suggested it was odd that Sweden didn't have a professional cinematographers society or organization. On his urgings the society was formed on 13 November 1961, modeled after the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC). The society started with 37 members and has subsequently grown.
It is a member of IMAGO, the European Federation of Cinematographers.
Olof Jonson is the current president.
Members.
Membership can only be achieved by recommendation by two other members.
FSF has had many Oscar-winning and awarded members in its ranks, including multiple Guldbagge Award-winners. Most notable are Sven Nykvist, ASC, FSF, Gunnar Fischer, FSF, Hoyte van Hoytema, ASC, FSF, NSC, Linus Sandgren, ASC, FSF, Jörgen Persson, FSF.

Anatoliadelphys

Anatoliadelphys maasae is an extinct genus of predatory metatherian mammal from the Eocene of Europe. It was an arboreal, cat-sized animal, with powerful crushing jaws similar to those of the modern Tasmanian devil. Although most mammalian predators of the northern hemisphere in this time period were placentals, Europe was an archipelago, and the island landmass now forming Turkey might have been devoid of competing mammalian predators, though this may not matter since other carnivorous metatherians are also known from the Cenozoic in the Northern Hemisphere. Nonetheless, it stands as a reminder that mammalian faunas in the Paleogene of the Northern Hemisphere were more complex than previously thought, and metatherians did not immediately lose their hold as major predators after their success in the Cretaceous.
Taxonomy.
The description of the new species and its genus, Anatoliadelphys, was published in 2017. The genus name combines terms derived from Greek, "Anatolia" for a region of Turkey and "delphys", meaning uterus, a commonly suffix for marsupial taxa.
The specific epithet honours the work of palaeontologist Mary Maas.
Description.
Holotype AÜJM 2002–25 was found in the Uzunçarşıdere Formation, Turkey. It is composed of a three-dimensionally preserved partial skull and near complete postcranial skeleton, one of the most well-preserved northern hemisphere metatherian specimens. The animal is approximately as large as a modern domestic cat at 2.76-3.97 kg; calculations were particularly difficult because its teeth are proportionally larger than those of modern carnivorous marsupials. The jaws are relatively short and robust and possess massive crushing, heavily worn premolars and molars and long, robust canines (no known incisors); while the skull is too incomplete to calculate the precise bite-force, it was most likely specialised for crushing and therefore it must have had a powerful bite.
The post-cranial skeleton seems to indicate an arboreal or semi-arboreal lifestyle, bearing grasping digits and a prehensile tail.
Phylogenetics.
A study incorporating several metatherian taxa showcases it as a non-marsupial but marsupialiform metatherian, most closely related to peradectids.
Biology.
"Anatoliadelphys" is inferred to be a specialised carnivore based on its dentition, with premolars and molars similar to those of other bone-crushing mammals (though these also resemble those of durophagous mammals as well, suggesting at least opportunistic clam-feeding) and massive, stabbing canines. Like most modern dasyuromorphians and several extinct metatherians like sparassodonts, it killed its prey with its jaws. It some aspects it resembles stagodontids, which also have crushing premolars and are inferred carnivores and molluscivores, though it lacks semi-aquatic adaptations and it has larger premolars and molars.
The authors of its paper claim that it was the largest carnivorous metatherian in the Cenozoic in the Northern Hemisphere, having likely evolved in isolation in the islands that are now Turkey, devoid of common placental carnivores of the time such as hyaenodonts and carnivorans. However, larger carnivorous metatherians are known from the Eocene and Miocene of Eurasia.

British Tar (1792 ship)

British Tar was launched at Shields in 1792 and made five voyages as a whaler and several as a West Indiaman. She then became a general trader. She was lost on 29 January 1818.
Career.
"British Tar" enters "Lloyd's Register" in 1792 with J. Fitch, master, Mangles, owner, and trade London–South Seas fisheries.
For her first whale fishing voyage "British Tar" sailed to Peru under the command of Jedediah Fitch. On 8 February 1793 she was at St Helena, homeward bound, and she arrived in England with 219 tuns of sperm oil.
On her second voyage she sailed in 1793 for Peru under the command of Blythe (or Thomas Bligh). She returned on 29 July 1794.
Her third voyage was again under the command of Bligh (or Blythe, or Blight), but this time he sailed her for the Pacific Ocean, where she was reported to be in August–September 1796. She returned to England on 8 May 1797.
"British Tar" then spent several years sailing to the West Indies. John and James Mangles still owned her and she sailed to San Domingo, but more often to Jamaica.
On 8 January 1802 Captain Innis sailed "British Tar" to the Galápagos Islands for her fourth whaling voyage. At some Point Captain Rowe replaced Innis. Homeward bound, she left St Helena on 4 May 1804, and arrived in England on 17 July.
Captain Charles Harrax (or , or Harrat, or Haddock), left England on 12 November 1804 and returned on 15 April 1807. This is the last whaling voyage for "British Tar"s that has any details. However, she may have continued whale hunting into 1810.
The "Register of Shipping" for 1810, in its supplemental pages, shows "British Tar" with Anthony, master, J. Pirie, owner, and trade London–Guadeloupe. In 1811 she underwent a large repair, and her trade became London–Newcastle.
Fate.
The "Register of Shipping" for 1818 showed "British Tar" with J. Pirie, owner and master, and trade London–Madeira. The entry has a line through it and the notation "Lost".
"Lloyd's List" reported on 3 February 1818 that a gale on 29 January 1818 had caused the total loss of "British Tar", John Pirie, master, between Lymington and Christchurch, Dorset. She was on her return voyage from Sierra Leone to London. All on board, at least 14 people, were lost.
The day after "British Tar" was lost, the body of a four-foot long African lizard was found on the beach by Hordle Cliff, near Milford. Apparently this animal was the largest of the kind ever brought to Europe.

Sant'Eframo Vecchio

Sant'Eframo Vecchio is a church in the centre of Naples, Italy. It is said either to be on the burial site of saint Efrimus or on the site - either he was originally buried there in a 5th century catacomb or his relics were translated there in the 13th century with those of Maximus of Naples and Fortunatus. There was a previous church on the site of unknown date, though the present structure was originally built in 1530 by the Capuchins. It has frequently been restored, such as the new maiolica facade of 1776 with five ovals by Tommaso Bruno. When the religious orders were suppressed after the Unification of Italy the Capuchins had to leave the church in 1865. The adjoining monastic buildings were acquired by the Monache delle Trentatré, who only returned them to the Capuchins in 1887.

Augusta Harvey Worthen

Augusta Harvey Worthen (September 27, 1823 – April 4, 1910) was an American educator and author. She taught school, and wrote poetry and prose. Her greatest work was the history of her town, Sutton, published in two volumes in 1890. This was the first New Hampshire town history prepared by a woman.
Early years and education.
Augusta Harvey was born in Sutton, New Hampshire, September 27, 1823. She was the daughter of Colonel John and Sally (Greeley) Harvey. Her uncles were Jonathan Harvey, a Congressman; and Matthew Harvey, governor of New Hampshire. She was the a granddaughter of another Matthew Harvey who was one of the first settlers of Sutton. She was sister to yet another Matthew Harvey, of Newport, New Hampshire who became the co-editor of the "New Hampshire Argus and Spectator" and it was mainly through the aid of this brother that her literary efforts were first published.
When Augusta was eight years old, she went to live with her Uncle Matthew, in Hopkinton, New Hampshire, and remained there for six years, while attending the Hopkinton Academy.
Career.
Starting at the age of sixteen, Worthen taught in district schools for two years. For the following three years, she was employed at a Lowell, Massachusetts cotton factory, working for fourteen hours each day and pursuing her studies in the evenings at a select school. Her first article was printed during this time, in the "Lowell Offering", a magazine for mill operatives. She then resumed teaching, and became a pupil-assistant in the Andover Academy, paying for her own tuition by instructing younger classes.
On February 15, 1855, she married, in Danvers, Massachusetts, Charles F. Worthen of Candia, New Hampshire. In 1858, she removed with him to Lynn, Massachusetts where he was engaged in manufacturing until his death in 1882, and where she continued to have her home nearly up to the time of her decease.
After marriage, she worked to carry her share of their mutual burdens, but after a time, she engaged in study and composition, and wrote prose sketches and poems. The great work of Worthen's life was the preparation of a history of her native town, Sutton, extending to over eleven-hundred pages. After being engaged in its research for twenty years, it was published in 1891. It was the first New Hampshire town history prepared by a woman. Thereafter, she wrote articles of fiction. Worthen's poems of especial merit were included in "New Hampshire Poets", "Poets of America", "Poets of Essex County", and several later collections, as well as by a portrait and biography in "A Woman of the Century".
Worthen died at Tewksbury, Massachusetts, April 4, 1910.

Elliott Wood

Major-General Sir Elliott Wood, (5 May 1844 – 7 September 1931) was a British Army officer, who served in the Anglo-Egyptian War, the Sudan Campaign and the Second Boer War.
Military career.
Wood was born in 1844, the son of Dr. Miles Astman Wood, of Ledbury. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 15 January 1864, and was promoted to captain on 30 September 1877. He served in the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882, and was present at the Battle of Tell El Kebir (September 1882), for which he was mentioned in despatches, received the medal with clasps, the 4th class of the Order of Medjidie, the Khedive's star, and a brevet promotion to major on 18 November 1882.

Fortunatus of Naples

Fortunatus of Naples was a 4th-century Christian bishop. He is the first historically-attested bishop of Naples, as one of the recipients of a letter written by those who took part in the Arian Council of Philippopolis in the 340s - his tradition states he was a fierce opponent of Arianism. His term as bishop is traditionally held to be 347 to 359.
He is venerated as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church, with a feast day on 14 June and a local feast in Naples on 8 November, the day when it celebrates the memory of all the "bishop saints of the Church of Naples". He is traditionally thought to have founded a cemetery basilica next to the set of catacombs in which he was later buried and which later became known as the Catacombs of Saint Gaudiosus after the 5th-century bishop Gaudiosus of Naples. Fortunatus' remains were translated by bishop John IV into the old Naples Cathedral in the 9th century. In the 13th century his relics were translated to Sant'Eframo Vecchio.

George Chichester, 5th Marquess of Donegall

George Augustus Hamilton Chichester, 5th Marquess of Donegall (27 June 1822 – 13 May 1904) was an Anglo-Irish soldier and company promoter who became an Irish and British peer, with a seat in the House of Lords. 
In his youth he was an officer of the 6th Regiment of Foot by purchase and a director of railway companies. He was made bankrupt in 1866 and died in reduced circumstances, after inheriting his peerages in 1889. After being widowed in 1901 he advertised that he was willing to marry again for £25,000 to be paid to himself and in the last year of his life finally succeeded in gaining a son and heir.
Early life.
Chichester was the oldest of the three sons of Lord Edward Chichester, a Church of Ireland clergyman who was Dean of Raphoe and a younger son of George Chichester, 2nd Marquess of Donegall. His mother was the former Amelia Spread Deane O'Grady, daughter of the barrister Henry Deane O'Grady. 
Chichester trained for a military career and was commissioned into the British Army. On 27 October 1843, he progressed from Ensign to Lieutenant in the 6th Regiment of Foot by purchase. In 1846, he was also a director of the London and Exeter Direct railway company and a member of the Provisional Committee of the Birmingham and Aberystwith Direct Railway.
Chichester's sister Annabella Augusta was the wife of Washington Shirley, 9th Earl Ferrers, and mother of Sewallis, the 10th Earl. Chichester also had two brothers, Henry Fitzwarine Chichester (born 1834) and Adolphus John Spencer Churchill Chichester (1836), and another sister, Dorcas. Lord Adolphus, who married Mary, only child of Robert Peel Dawson, was the grandfather of James Chichester-Clark, Baron Moyola, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland.
Co-respondent and first marriage.
After the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 came into force, Chichester appeared at least three times in the new Divorce Court. He was co-respondent for adultery in the case of "Lloyd v. Lloyd and Chichester", and again in "Mure v. Mure and Chichester". On 1 July 1859 the court granted a decree to dissolve the marriage of the Mures, and on 9 August Chichester married Mrs Mure, but in 1863 he successfully applied to the court for this marriage to be declared void, bringing an action against "Virginia Elizabeth Mure, falsely called Virginia Elizabeth Chichester", on the grounds that no divorcee could remarry within three months of the decree. "The Spectator" drily called this "a fact which Mr. Chichester, with his large experience in such cases, would, one would think, have known", and added that "the case is just one of those which create the vulgar belief that the class to which Mr. Chichester belongs is exceptionally immoral."
Bankruptcy.
In July 1866 Chichester, then living at 55, Sloane Street, Knightsbridge, responded to an action in bankruptcy by entering into an arrangement with his creditors to pay them 2s 6d in the pound (12.5%) in three instalments.
Peerages.
In 1853, Chichester's father, Lord Edward, became heir presumptive of his elder brother George Hamilton Chichester, 3rd Marquess of Donegall, when the marquess' only surviving son died unmarried in Naples. On 20 October 1883, at the age of 84, Lord Edward finally succeeded his brother as Marquess of Donegall, together with several subsidiary titles, and George Chichester gained the courtesy title of Earl of Belfast. As a large part of the Donegall estates were not entailed, they were inherited by Chichester's cousin Harriet Augusta Anna Seymourina, wife of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 8th Earl of Shaftesbury.
On his father's death in 1889, Chichester became the 5th Marquess of Donegall and also the 5th Baron Fisherwick, in the Peerage of Great Britain, giving him a seat in the House of Lords. He is not recorded as ever having spoken there.
Later marriages.
On 31 August 1865 Chichester married secondly Mary Anne Williams Cobb, the youngest daughter of Edward Cobb, of Arnold, Kent, and Kensington. The marriage was childless, and his wife died in November 1901, her final address being 7, Upper Rock Gardens, Brighton. Probate of her will was granted to Alice Cobb, widow, and all of her property was valued at £43.
In February 1902, weeks after the death of his second (or perhaps first) wife, Donegall advertised in "The Daily Telegraph" for a lady "willing to purchase the rank of a peeress... for twenty-five thousand pounds sterling, paid in cash to her future husband, she must be a widow or a spinster—not a divorcee." "Country Life" later commented that this "scarcely suggests a fairytale romance" and described Donegall as "an old roué", continuing "May one speculate on the appropriateness of the Donegall coat-of-arms? The supporters are two red wolves held in chains of gold." On 23 December 1902, by now aged eighty, Lord Donegall married thirdly Violet Gertrude Twining (1880–1952) only daughter of Henry St George Twining, a banker of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Coombe Oak, Kingston Hill, Surrey, and they had one child, Edward Arthur Donald St George Hamilton Chichester, born on 7 October 1903, who became Marquess of Donegall when his father died on 13 May 1904. Donegall, whose address at death was 117, Cromwell Road, Kensington, died at 42, Norfolk Road, Brighton, leaving an estate valued at only £27.
His widow died on 8 October 1952, at the age of 72. His infant son Edward grew up to become a journalist and war correspondent.

Sign of Tanit

The sign of Tanit or sign of Tinnit is an anthropomorph symbol present on many archaeological remains of the Punic civilization.
The symbol has many variants, but the basic form consists of a disc on top of a triangle, separated by a horizontal line, like a schematic image of a person.
The first representations of the sign were reported on stele unearthed on the site of Carthage from the beginning of the 19th century. Archaeological excavations have subsequently uncovered representations on other supports such as mosaics or even on ceramics.
The excavations of tophet of Carthage, Sousse and Motya have highlighted the particularly important diffusion of the symbol in the western basin of the Mediterranean Sea, although the few discoveries on primitive Phoenician land may only be due to continued occupation of sites making searches more difficult.
Modern scholars associate the symbol with the goddess Tanit, partner of Ba'al Hammon and the most important goddess in the Punic religion. This identification is widely, but not universely, accepted. Some scholars have argued that the symbol derived from the Egyptian ankh, on the basis of the visual similarity between the two symbols and the close connections between Punic Carthage and the Egypt. The motif may have had an apotropaic purpose, intended to offer protection from the evil eye.
The symbol is used in some contexts in modern Tunisia. For example, it has appeared on the Tanit d'or, the grand prize of the biennial Carthage Film Festival, since its establishment in 1966.

The big-scaled redfin ("Tribolodon hakonensis"), also known as the Japanese dace, is a medium-sized Asian fish. First described by Albert Günther in 1877 as "Leuciscus hakonensis", it is the type specimen of the genus "Tribolodon", having been described again as "Tribolodon punctatum" by Henri Émile Sauvage when he established that genus in 1883. It is the most widely distributed of the "Tribolodon" species, found over much of the Sea of Japan. It is known to carry a number of parasites, including the trematode species "Centrocestus armatus" (for which it is a second intermediate host), and the copepod species "Ergasilus fidiformis", which is carried in the fish's gills.

The Icaro Twin Electric is an Italian electric ultralight trike that was designed by World Hang Glider Champion pilot Manfred Ruhmer and under development by Icaro 2000 of Sangiano.
As of 2018 the aircraft was not advertised on the manufacturer's website and it is likely that it did not progress beyond one flying prototype.
Design and development.
The Twin Electric design features a cable-braced hang glider-style high-wing, weight-shift controls, a two-seats-in-tandem open cockpit without a cockpit fairing, tricycle landing gear and twin electric motors mounted on lateral booms, in pusher configuration.
The aircraft is made from bolted-together aluminum tubing, with its single surface Rx Bip bi-place wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. Its wing is supported by a single tube-type kingpost and uses an "A" frame weight-shift control bar. Power is supplied by two electric motors mounted on booms, one each side of the trike frame, each driving a pusher propeller.
The Rx Bip wing was selected to allow STOL capabilities.
Operational history.
The Twin Electric was reported as being flight tested in 2015.

André Charlin

André Marie Bernard Charlin (20 March 1903 – 28 November 1983) was a French audio engineer and entrepreneur.
He was a prolific inventor and filed many patents for radio amplifiers, movie sound recording equipment, and music recording.
He founded and operated companies to make his equipment and to make the recordings. 
Early years (1903–30).
André Marie Bernard Charlin was born on 20 March 1903 in Paris.
He was the second of four children of Georges Charlin (1869–1915) and Louise Rogonot (1879–1930).
At the age of 13 he was a talented flutist.
His father died that year and his uncle Edmond Ragonot, an electrical engineer, took an interest in the boy and helped him build his first radio receiver.
Towards the end of World War I (1914–18) he built an amplifier, and in 1922 he filed his first patent for an electro-dynamic speaker diaphragm embedded in a screen.
He sold the rights to this invention to the Compagnie Francaise Thomson-Houston in 1927.
He completed his military service in 1926.
That year he was granted patents for a push-pull electrostatic loudspeaker and for a variable reluctance pick-up system.
He started a small business making radios and loudspeakers.
Charlin married Madeleine Blanchard (1907–2006) on 7 October 1926.
In the years that followed Charlin was granted many patents for improvements to amplifiers.
Movie equipment (1930–49).
Charlin became involved in cinematography at a time when sound was starting to be added to motion pictures, and began to build equipment for synchronous sound playback.
At first this used 33 rpm records.
The first "talkies" appeared in 1931, and Charlin began working on ways to improve sound quality through better recording technology.
He founded a recording studio in 1933 that produced the sound tracks for many prewar movies, including in 1934 a stereo sound track for Abel Gance's 1927 silent movie "Napoléon".
He moved into techniques for film projection with a 1935 patent for "Cyclope" focussing and a 1938 patent for "Actua Colour" to project colour films which was used in over 1,000 movie theatres by 1948. 
During World War II he turned to making dynamos to power the lamps of bicycles.
In 1949 Charlin stopped producing cinema equipment and sold all his related patents to Philips of the Netherlands.
Early in the 1950s Radio-Cinema, a subsidiary of the Compagnie générale de la télégraphie sans fil, acquired Charlin' company.
Records (1949–83).
Charlin returned to recording music.
In 1949 Charlin produced the first European microgroove vinyl record, "L'Apothéose de Lully" by François Couperin, conducted by Roger Désormière.
Charlin developed a recording head in 1954 and a technique for stereo recording in 1958.
He recorded many world famous artists, including twelve microgroove recordings of the famous Portuguese conductor Pedro de Freitas Branco. Most of the recordings were made at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris with an orchestra assembled for the purpose. Two of them received the Grand Prix du Disque.
In 1955 he recorded Pierre Cochereau playing Bach fugues on the organ of Notre-Dame de Paris. Charlin mistook Cochereau's mordents as wrong notes, and repeatedly stopped him. Perhaps as a result Cochereau played much more slowly than normal, and the recording was savagely attacked by the critics.
Charlin briefly collaborated with Michel Garcin in developing Erato Records, then after breaking with his partner in 1962 created his Centre d'Enregistrement des Champs Elysees (CECE) label with Carl de Nys.
In 1963–64 Charlin patented the "Tete Charlin", a dummy head for commercial stereophonic records with two high-quality microphones from the Schoeps company. The term "dummy head" refers to the device's vague resemblance to a human head.
During his career Charlin filed at least 80 patents and received 118 Grand Prix du Disque.
Charlin died in Paris on 28 November 1983.

Eastgate railway station

Eastgate railway station, also known as Eastgate-in-Weardale, served the village of Eastgate in County Durham, North East England from 1895 to 1953 as a stop on the Wear Valley Line.
History.
Railway development in Weardale was a slow process: the to route of the Bishop Auckland &amp; Weardale Railway reached as far as Witton Junction (east of Witton-le-Wear) in November 1843. However the Wear Valley Railway was the first line to truly enter the dale when it opened as a branch from Witton Junction to and Bishopley on 3 August 1847 and this was then extended to by the Frosterley &amp; Stanhope Railway in 1862. However it was not until 21 October 1895 that the railway reached Eastgate when the North Eastern Railway extended the line from Stanhope to and opened the station at Eastgate.
The station had a goods shed (which still remains as the only remaining example of one of many similar goods sheds on the Wearhead extension of the line) and a number of sidings however the lack of run-round facilities meant that all shunting had to be carried by a rope attached to the locomotive.
The station was closed to passengers by British Railways (BR) on 29 June 1953 when passenger services on the branch west of Wear Valley Junction were withdrawn, though goods traffic continued to serve the station for some years. In 1961 the line was cut back to and then, in 1968, it was further reduced to the Blue Circle Cement Works (later owned by Lafarge), just to the west of Eastgate station. This had opened in 1964 and utilised purpose built railway container waggons to transport most of the cement that it produced to Teesside, Tyneside and Scotland. On 14 September 1970, Eastgate became a public delivery siding and continued in this role until the withdrawal of the remaining local goods services on 14 September 1980. Cement traffic continued, however, and so the line was retained. Then, in 1988, BR introduced a summer Sunday extension to the regular to 'Heritage Line' service as far as Stanhope and this was continued until the service was withdrawn after the summer of 1992 followed by the remaining cement traffic on 17 March 1993.
Rather than close the line when freight traffic was withdrawn, BR mothballed it and a campaign began in 1993 to preserve the line as a heritage railway. Weardale Railways Limited purchased the line in 2004 and reopened it between and Stanhope in July 2004. However the organisation struggled financially and the service was suspended a short time later, not recommencing until August 2006.
On 29 September 2009, the development of the Eastgate Renewable Energy Village received unanimous outline approval by the County Durham strategic planning committee. This plan would have involved the opening of a new station at Eastgate to serve new development on the site of the cement works (demolished in 2005) but the withdrawal of government funding in 2010 put the plans under threat and by 2013 the project appeared to have stalled.
The Weardale Railway did, however remain active and, after major efforts to clear the line of vegetation and repair damaged tracks, passenger services along the section between Stanhope and Bishop Auckland West were reintroduced on 23 May 2010 and continued until the end of the 2012 season. However, in June 2014 a limited, volunteer-run passenger service was reintroduced between Stanhope and Wolsingham using a class 122 "Bubble Car" and on 27 March 2016 this service was extended to . It is therefore possible that passenger services could return to Eastgate in future.

Emerich Szerencsés

Emerich Szerencsés (also known as Fortunatus; died August 1526) was deputy treasurer of the Kingdom of Hungary and a Jewish convert to Christianity.
Life.
He was born Jewish but had to convert when it became known that he had sex with a Christian woman. He was baptised by Ladislaus Szalkai, Archbishop of Grau, and took the baptismal name Emerich after his sponsor Emerich Perényi, Palatine of Hungary. His wife and his sons Abraham and Ephraim remained practising Jews. After his conversion he was appointed deputy treasurer, using his position to send coded letters warning Hungarian Jews on imminent persecution, to secure the revocation of the expulsion of the Jews from Prague and to save a Jewish man and woman who had been condemned to death by fire. He also became a favourite of Louis II of Hungary.
When the Jewish community of Ofen was accused of ritual murder he convinced Louis to hand the accuser over to him. He gave a Jewish education to the children of another baptised Jew and gave to Jewish charities every Friday until his death. As a reward the rabbis of Ofen, Padua and Constantinople ordered that Szerencsés' sons Abraham and Ephraim should be called up to the Law by their father's name - usually the sons of baptised Jews had to be called up by their grandfather's names. This also recognised their view that, at heart, Szerencsés was still a Jew.
Stephan Verböczi and other Hungarian nobles accused him of causing the country's financial problems and some members of the 1525 Diet moved for him to be burned at the stake. The accusations of gross negligence proved justified, since he had used state funds for private ends, as did many respected noblemen at the time. Louis II briefly imprisoned him and his home was attacked and looted by a mob led by the nobles' servants, though Szerencsés himself managed to escape. Another mob simultaneously stormed and looted the city's ghetto. With the invasion threat from the Ottoman Empire looming large, Szerencsés was restored to favour at the 1526 Diet but died later that year, with many Jews at his death-bed.

Ravenna Helson

Ravenna Mathews Helson (b. February 13, 1925) is an American psychologist known for her research on the psychology of women and creativity. Dacher Keltner has described her as "a pioneer in the study of women's lives".
Career.
Helson completed her PhD in Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) in 1952. She joined the faculty of psychology at Smith College, but moved with her husband, mathematician Henry Helson, back to California in 1955 when he was offered a faculty position at UC Berkeley. Helson began working at the Institute of Personality Assessment and Research (IPAR) in 1957, when she accepted an invitation from director Donald W. MacKinnon to join the Institute. She was promoted to the position of full-status researcher at IPAR in 1980, and became an adjunct professor of psychology at UC Berkeley the same year. 
Helson was a key figure in organizing and conducting the Mills Longitudinal Study, a long-term study of personality development over the lifespan. The study involved more than 100 Mills College senior undergraduates (born 1937-1939), who were recruited in 1958-1959, and continues to the present day. The main purpose of the study was to examine personality in relation to creativity in women. Over the years, the study expanded to address varied topics including changes in personality over the lifespanand in relation to women's work lives, marital satisfaction after child rearing, and the impact of culture on individualism. 
Helson is an adjunct professor emeritus of psychology at UC Berkeley.
Personal life.
Helson was born in Austin, Texas to E. J. Mathews, Registrar and Dean of Admissions at the University of Texas and Ravenna Wakefield Mathews. She graduated summa cum laude from the University of Texas and briefly worked as a newspaper reporter in Corpus Christi, Texas before returning to school to study psychology. 
Helson married Henry Helson in 1954. The couple had three children together, and remained married until Henry's death in 2010.

Alan Hodge

Alan Hodge (16 October 1915 – 25 May 1979) was an English historian and journalist. He was a member of the circle of writers and artists that centred on Laura Riding and Robert Graves in the late 1930s, and later collaborated with Graves on "The Long Week-End", a social history of Britain between the wars, and "The Reader Over Your Shoulder", a guide to writing English prose. After the Second World War he worked as the general editor of Hamish Hamilton's Novel Library, as an editorial assistant on Winston Churchill's "History of the English-Speaking Peoples", and as a founding co-editor (with Peter Quennell) of the successful magazine "History Today".
Parentage and education.
Alan Hodge was born on 16 October 1915 in Scarborough, Yorkshire; his father was T. S. Hodge, a Cunard Line captain and officer in the Royal Naval Reserve. He grew up in Liverpool and attended Liverpool Collegiate School before going up to Oriel College, Oxford where he read history. In his spare time he wrote poetry and, with Kenneth Allott, co-edited the Oxford University English Club's magazine, "Programme".
The Riding-Graves circle.
In 1935 Hodge, then in his second year at Oriel, wrote a review of the first volume of "Epilogue", an irregular critical journal, which led to a correspondence with its editor, the American poet Laura Riding. Riding invited Hodge to visit her at the house in Majorca she shared with Robert Graves, and Hodge duly turned up in time for Christmas. He made an excellent impression; Graves noted in his diary, "Hodge very decent &amp; sensible", and described him as "young, blonde good head". Another description of his appearance a year or so later described him as "a small blond boy with a cherubic soprano's face, an incongruously deep and hollow voice, and a deliberate, sententious manner; he seemed about sixteen". Hodge went home in early January 1936, but returned the following July to spend the summer holidays there. He was kept busy helping with a planned series of schoolbooks, contributing to "Epilogue", and writing poems. During July the Spanish Civil War broke out, and on 2 August, acting on official advice, the entire household left Majorca aboard a British destroyer.
Hodge settled in London with his new girlfriend Beryl Pritchard, a PPE student he had met at Oxford, but remained a part of the circle of writers and artists dominated by Laura Riding. Before long he decided to return to Spain to work for the beleaguered Socialist government, despite himself being a lifelong Conservative, but Riding told him he must stay in England. Hodge, who was becoming her closest disciple, acquiesced. At this time he was working on a novel called "A Year of Damage", based on his experiences with a former girlfriend, Audrey Beecham, and by the spring of 1937 it was completed. Graves and Riding supervised its progress closely and made many suggestions for its improvement, all of which he adopted, but though both of them loved the finished book Hodge wouldn't publish it, and destroyed the manuscript. In the second half of 1937 he used his skills as a historical researcher to help Graves with the writing of "Count Belisarius", a novel set in the early Byzantine Empire; and at about the same time they worked on a historical survey of the influence of politics on literature, eventually published in Harry Kemp and Laura Riding's book "The Left Heresy in Literature and Life". These were only the first results of a fruitful partnership between the two friends.
First marriage.
On 29 January 1938 Hodge and Beryl Pritchard were married. Beryl had previously doubted it was a good idea, but Hodge won her round; Beryl's parents were less amenable, her father being rude to Hodge at the wedding, and her mother telling her she was throwing her life away. In June Riding, Graves, the Hodges and two more of the coterie travelled to Rennes in Brittany and found a large country house, which they rented and moved into. A year later the entire party took ship for America, where an old friend of Graves, the journalist Tom Matthews, had engaged to find them a home. The atmosphere in the new community became increasingly claustrophobic and nightmarish as Riding's domination grew more oppressive, and in a few months the group broke up. Hodge, utterly disillusioned with Riding, returned to England with Graves in August, Beryl being expected to follow shortly after. By now the dynamic of the Hodge marriage had completely changed, both coming to suspect that theirs was more a friendship than a romance, while Beryl and Graves had gradually fallen in love with each other. On arriving in England Hodge immediately set out on a journalistic assignment to Poland, and was in Warsaw when the German army invaded the country. He managed to return to England by a circuitous journey via Estonia, Finland, Sweden and Norway. Beryl reached England from America in October and moved in with Graves, a situation which Hodge, after some initial resistance, accepted without ill-feeling. Beryl remained with Graves for the rest of his life, while Hodge kept his close friendship with both.
Collaborations with Robert Graves.
Hodge now resumed his literary partnership with Graves, beginning with some historical research on the American War of Independence for Graves's Sergeant Lamb novels. The next project, "The Long Week-End", was intended as "a reliable record of what took place, of a forgettable sort, during the twenty-one-year interval between the two great European wars", for which Hodge did research work and wrote first drafts of several of the chapters. The evidence was mainly drawn from ephemeral sources, such as newspapers, magazines and radio broadcasts, and the book depicted British life in this period as being mainly devoted to frivolities and distractions. "The Long Week-End" was completed in June 1940 and published the following November by Faber and Faber, with Graves and Hodge being credited as co-authors. There have been many subsequent editions in Britain and the United States, it has been translated into Danish and Swedish and even published in Braille. On its first publication the reaction of academe was mixed. One historian detected the malign influence of the Mass-Observation movement in the authors' approach, and called it "a strange unfocused photograph of the times, in which, although the 'camera-eye' has not lied, it has failed entirely to introduce any perspective or integration", but the sociologist Alfred McClung Lee thought it "regrettable that so few books do so well the useful task Graves and Hodge assigned themselves". Press reviews had some very enthusiastic things to say: "thoroughly good reading", "swift, ironic, entertaining...fair and penetrating and a thoroughly significant book today", "it could hardly have been better done". More recently it has been described as "stimulating and well-informed", and by Francis Wheen as "enthralling", while for the historian Alfred F. Havighurst "nothing has as yet replaced" it as a social history of the period.
By August 1940 the two were working together on what Graves called a "new book about English prose...for the general reader, and also for intelligent colleges and VI-forms". Originally intended to help Graves's daughter Jenny Nicholson, it was eventually published as "The Reader Over Your Shoulder: A Handbook for Writers of English Prose". Its plan, which owes something to Riding's 1938 work "The World and Ourselves", is as follows: first come chapters entitled "The Peculiar Qualities of English", "The Present Confusion of English Prose", "Where Is Good English to Be Found?", and "The Use and Abuse of Official English"; then a history of English prose, quoting many examples; then chapters on "The Principles of Clear Statement" and "The Graces of Prose"; finally, taking up the greater part of the book, the authors present under the title "Examinations and Fair Copies" fifty-four stylistically aberrant passages by well-known writers, analyze their faults, and rewrite them in better English. This last section, according to the academic Denis Donoghue, "accounted for much of the fame and nearly all of the delight that the book has given its readers". Getting copyright waivers from each of the 54 writers made demands on the co-authors' time, and since this section was, in Graves's words, "dynamite under so many chairs", also on their diplomacy. Their private nickname for the book was "A Short Cut to Unpopularity". The publishers Faber and Faber initially accepted the book while it was still in progress, but later took fright and dropped it; it was finally published in May 1943 by Jonathan Cape. There have been several later editions, some at full length and some drastically abridged. G. W. Stonier, reviewing "The Reader Over Your Shoulder" in the "New Statesman and Nation", regretted that "a book, whose general aims are admirable, should be spoilt so often by its pedantry", but most other contemporary reviews were favourable: "it might seem that "The Reader Over Your Shoulder" would be unavoidably dry on questions of punctuation and grammar, but even here it is witty and stimulating — a desk-book for the writer that should never fail to key him up", "a stimulating and stirring book, which meets a great and genuine need of our times", "instructive and entertaining book", "highly pleasurable and in some degree profitable", "any editor of [this journal] would mortgage the office filing cabinet to place this book before the eyes of every contributor". "The Spectator" wryly noted that "this book, with its high standards, its scholarship and its brilliance, is exactly calculated to suit the contemporary taste for spiced and potted knowledge which it deplores". Evelyn Waugh wrote in "The Tablet", "This is the century of the common man; let him write as he speaks and let him speak as he pleases. This the deleterious opinion to which "The Reader Over Your Shoulder" provides a welcome corrective"; he ended, "as a result of having read [it]...I have taken about three times as long to write this review as is normal, and still dread committing it to print". It has been highly praised in the years since. For the sociologist C. Wright Mills it was "the best book I know" on writing, for the academic Greg Myers, "relentlessly prescriptive and hilarious", for the journalist Mark Halperin "one of the three or four books on usage that deserve a place on the same shelf as Fowler". The biographer Miranda Seymour said that "as a handbook to style, it has never been bettered", and the literary critic Denis Donoghue wrote, "I don't know any other book in which expository prose is read so seriously, carefully, helpfully. For this reason the book is just as important as I. A. Richards' "Practical Criticism"". He went on, "there is no point in being scandalized by the assumption in "The Reader Over Your Shoulder" that good English is the sort of English written by Graves and Hodge. In my opinion, that claim is justified."
By 1941 another project was in the offing alongside "The Reader Over Your Shoulder". This was intended as a volume of new poems by Hodge, Graves, James Reeves, Norman Cameron and Harry Kemp , all of whom were veterans of the Laura Riding circle. In the event the publisher, Hogarth Press, rejected Reeves and Kemp from this line-up, so when the book appeared in March 1942 it included 17 poems by Hodge alongside contributions by Graves and Cameron, "published under a single cover for economy and friendship", as the Authors' Note says. "The Times Literary Supplement" thought Hodge's poems showed "an ironic humour...enriched by a spontaneous vivacity and a sympathetic closeness to nature".
One more book was to have been a collaboration between Graves and Hodge. This was eventually published under Graves's name alone as "The White Goddess: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth". Hodge retired from the project at a fairly early stage, in 1943, as it became clear that this would be a very personal view of the nature of poetic inspiration and would go beyond his own areas of expertise. Of the central thesis of the book Hodge wrote, "I think it is a good myth, that is, it has truth, and it is not necessary to ask whether it is entirely factually true". They would not produce another book together again, and Graves began to recede from the foreground of Hodge's life.
Civil Service and journalism.
Hodge spent the Second World War at the Ministry of Information, where he served first under Sir Harold Nicolson, then as Assistant Private Secretary to his successor, Brendan Bracken. In 1944 he added to his workload by taking a job as book-reviewer to the London local paper, the "Evening Standard". After the 1945 general election Bracken was out of office, and Hodge left with him, but when Bracken took on a gossip column called "Men and Matters" at the "Financial Times" in 1946 he appointed Hodge his assistant. According to Hodge's later description of his role as Bracken's literary catalyst he would be "asked to produce a list of targets for attack. Invariably these were shot down by Bracken in withering terms. This was part of a process of warming up by which he got into his stride". Not everyone reacted well to this kind of treatment – his civil servants cheered when he departed in 1945, and he is rumoured to have been in some respects the model for Orwell's Big Brother – but the relationship with Hodge was different, Bracken having a genuine fondness for him as well as a respect for his scholarship.
Publishing.
From 1946 to 1952 Hodge worked for the publishing firm Hamish Hamilton as the general editor of their Novel Library, a series of reprints of classic novels, both English and foreign. The introductions with which Hodge furnished some of the volumes won the admiration of Raymond Chandler, who wrote to the publisher, "Your man Hodge is a superb editor, the rarest kind of mind...Surely no one could write better introductions". The series was eventually wrapped up, but Novel Library editions are now much sought after in secondhand bookshops. He also produced for Hamish Hamilton two translations from the French, "Maigret's Mistake" by Georges Simenon (later reprinted by Penguin) and "Caves of Adventure" by Haroun Tazieff.
Life as a working historian.
The last 28 years of Hodge's life were dominated by his work on the magazine "History Today". This was the creation of Brendan Bracken, Hodge's old boss and from 1945 Chairman of the Financial News group which owned the "Financial Times". One of his projects was the creation of a monthly history magazine to be edited by Hodge, but when in 1950 he decided to act on this plan he brought in the literary biographer Peter Quennell as well, making the two men co-editors. Paper-rationing delayed the magazine's launch, but on 12 January 1951 the first issue appeared. "History Today" (the title was allegedly suggested by Winston Churchill) was attractively illustrated and aimed itself at the general reader without writing down to him. The intention, as A. L. Rowse later wrote, was to "bridge the gap between specialist journals, all too often unreadable by the general public, and the intelligent reader who wanted to read history". From the first the magazine brought in a wide range of heavyweight academic historians to contribute articles, the first two issues alone boasting the names of G. M. Trevelyan, G. M. Young, Veronica Wedgwood, Eric Linklater, Alan Bullock, A. J. P. Taylor, D. W. Brogan, G. D. H. Cole and Max Beloff. Later Hodge and Quennell brought in experts from a wide range of fields, including Kenneth Clark, Freya Stark, Nancy Mitford, Arthur Waley, Julian Huxley and Michael Grant. Hodge's editorial style was described as "scholarly, imaginative and judicious".
While editing the magazine Hodge took up a prolonged side-activity, the editing of Winston Churchill's "History of the English-Speaking Peoples". Churchill had begun to work on this massive work during his "wilderness years", in 1932, and it was in proof by the time he re-entered the Cabinet in September 1939, at which point he had to lay it aside. In 1953, once again Prime Minister, he returned to the "History", uncertain whether it was in a publishable state. His close friend Bracken advised him to take on Hodge as an editorial assistant, the introductions were made, and Hodge soon found himself leading a team of historians advising Churchill on necessary revisions. His brief was to produce "a lively, continuous narrative" emphasizing "famous dramatic events", but getting major changes made in the text proved very difficult. "Errors of fact were changed with courteous alacrity," according to the historian John H. Plumb; "subject to strong pressure, an adjective might or might not be pruned, but the grand design proved immutable." Hodge worked in various places: at home, at the "History Today" offices, at Chartwell (Churchill's home in Kent), and in the south of France where Churchill spent lengthy holidays. They developed a close friendship, but the work came to an end at last in 1957.
One project suffered from Hodge's heavy workload in these years. When his old friend Norman Cameron died from a stroke in 1953 leaving Hodge his copyrights, Hodge agreed to prepare an edition of his poems with an introduction by Robert Graves. This edition hung fire for a long time, to Graves's increasing anger, but the "Collected Poems" finally appeared in June 1957.
The same year, having resigned as Prime Minister amid heavy press criticism of the Suez Crisis, Anthony Eden decided to write his memoirs as a way of giving his side of the story. He recruited a team of historians to assist him, and Bracken once more stepped forward to recommend Hodge for his "grace of style and nicety of perspective". Hodge joined the team, and was kept occupied through to 1959.
In 1958 Brendan Bracken died, and Hodge was commissioned to write his biography. He researched his subject diligently, but found himself hampered by the fact that Bracken had ordered his private papers to be burned after his death and also by a sense of loyalty to his old boss which would not have allowed him to publish everything he found. After several years he abandoned the task and gave his notes to Charles Lysaght and Andrew Boyle, both of whom were engaged on the same task.
In 1960 Hodge and Quennell collaborated on "The Past We Share: An Illustrated History of the British and American Peoples". Reviews were mixed. "Kirkus Reviews" called it "a superb panoramic view of history with a somewhat misleading subtitle, for the emphasis is so largely British that the America aspects take definitely second place", "The New Yorker" "a more than ordinarily serious entry in a frequently trumped-up field", and "The Booklist and Subscription Books Bulletin" "an inviting historical summary for casual reading"; the "Times Literary Supplement" found the illustrations good in themselves but inaccurately captioned, the "New York Herald Tribune" thought that "the real past we share with the English was a broader, harsher, more dynamic and far more astonishing saga of conquest than this genteel survey suggests", "The New York Times" that "the luminous histories of our two peoples have not been dovetailed at all (as the title implied they would be) but rather set side by side to languish augustly in isolation from one another", but the "Chicago Sunday Tribune" believed that "this gallery of a pictured past is as rewarding as any the reader is likely to tour for some time".
Alan Hodge remained until his death the co-editor with Peter Quennell of "History Today". He died at the age of 63 on 25 May 1979.
Personal life.
In 1942 Hodge opened the way for his first wife, Beryl, to marry Graves by instituting divorce proceedings, and the divorce was made absolute the following year. In the autumn of 1947 he met Jane Aiken, daughter of the poet and novelist Conrad Aiken, and on 3 January 1948 they married. He encouraged her to begin her successful career writing Gothic romances. They lived in Wimbledon and later Lewes, and had two daughters, Jessica and Joanna.

Louise-Catherine

Louise-Catherine is a former coal barge that was converted by the architect Le Corbusier into a floating homeless shelter, moored in Paris. It is a registered historic monument of the city of Paris. After being unused for years, it was under renovation as a cultural centre when it sank in the aftermath of the flooding of the Seine in early 2018.
History.
"Louise-Catherine" is a flat-bottomed reinforced concrete barge long and wide. It was built in 1915 as "Liège" to bring coal from Rouen to Paris during the First World War.
Homeless shelter.
In 1929 Madeleine Zillhardt bought the barge with the profit from reselling a drawing and donated it to the Salvation Army on condition it be renamed "Louise-Catherine" after her companion, Louise Catherine Breslau, who had died shortly before. A friend of hers and Breslau's, Winnaretta Singer, had it brought from Rouen and commissioned Le Corbusier to design its conversion into a 160-bed homeless shelter. He created three dormitories, dining rooms, toilet facilities including showers, quarters for a boatsman and the shelter director, and a hanging garden on the former bridge. He installed square windows and thin columns and designed the furniture, including cupboards with sliding doors. Le Corbusier wrote that the intention was for the barge to be moored in front of the Louvre Museum in winter as a homeless shelter, and in summer to be used as a floating children's camp, further upstream at the Pont des Arts. Its use was suspended during the Second World War, and in 1950 it was repurposed to house ex-prisoners and discharged hospital patients as well as the homeless.
Renovation and sinking.
The Salvation Army closed the shelter in 1994 after the hull flooded. In 2006 they sold the barge to the Kertekian family and two other benefactors; the Association Louise-Catherine, headed by architect Michel Cantal-Dupart, was formed to renovate it into a museum and cultural centre with financial assistance from the Fondation Le Corbusier and the French state. It was designated a Paris historical monument by the Direction régionale des affaires culturelles in 2008; now moored near the Gare d'Austerlitz, it is the only watercraft in the city to be registered as a monument. During renovation by the architecture firm ACYC, the barge was to be enclosed in a temporary metal structure designed by the Japanese architect Shuhei Endo. There are plans to build two gangplanks for access modelled on those originally installed.
When the level of the Seine dropped after the January 2018 flood, "Louise-Catherine"s bow caught on the lip of the wharf and on 8 February, despite efforts to free it so she could right herself, the barge took on water and sank rapidly. The fire service brought in a pusher to assist and the wave created when she hit the water may have hastened her sinking. Once the water level returns to normal, the Association plan to have her inspected by divers and refloated and if possible to complete the renovation in time to open the exhibition space to the public in October 2018 with an exhibit of work by Japanese architects "passionate about this story and the work of Le Corbusier", as a celebration of 160 years of Franco-Japanese friendship. Donations may be sought to help with raising the barge.

CESRA

The Community of European Solar Radio Astronomers (CESRA) is a non-profit informal organization of European scientists whose aims are to promote studies of solar radio physics and related topics.
Established in 1970, its membership includes scientists from 28 European research institutes.&lt;ref name="Solar/Radio Institutes"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
History.
Arnold O. Benz reports that CESRA was initiated by a letter written in June 1970 by A.D. Fokker (Utrecht) with which he invited “many” solar radio astronomers to a meeting at the International Astronomical Union (IAU) General Assembly in Brighton (August 18–27, 1970) (the letter was found by Arnold O. Benz. CESRA's initial purpose was to promote the development of a European instrument for solar radio observations, the Joint Interferometer Project (JIP). The organization's “statement of intentions and policy” was adopted at the 1972 meeting in Bordeaux. Initially the “CESRA” acronym meant “Committee of European Solar Radio Astronomers” and members were the representatives from each observatory. In that phase CESRA was chaired by A.D. Fokker. 
When JIP became unrealistic in 1978, it was decided not to dissolve the organization, but give it to a “caretaker” to do whatever needed. The caretaker was Arnold O. Benz until 1992. In 1992 at a meeting with Arnold O. Benz, M. Pick, G. Trottet, A. Magun and P. Zlobec, decided to transform CESRA to a more organized entity with a President, a Board and Statutes, changed “Committee” to “Community” and gave CESRA a democratic structure with statutes similar to today’s.
Since 1992 the following scientists have served as CESRA presidents: Arnold O. Benz (Zurich; 1992-1998), Karl-Ludwig Klein (Meudon; 1998-2010), Silja Pohjolainen (Turku; 2010-2016), and Eduard Kontar (Glasgow; 2016-...).
Conferences.
CESRA organizes triennial workshops&lt;ref name="Workshops/Meetings"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; on investigations of the solar atmosphere using radio and other observations. Although special emphasis is given to radio diagnostics, the workshop topics are of interest to a large community of solar physicists. The format of the workshops usually combine plenary sessions and working group sessions, with invited review talks, oral contributions, and posters. The workshops attract not only European scientists, but also scientists from the USA, China, Japan, Australia, and Brazil. 
CESRA has also cosponsored international solar physics conferences organized by the European Physical Society and in one occasion has organized a session within the European Geophysical Society's General Assembly.
Summer Schools.
Three summer schools have been organized by CESRA. The schools were open to solar radio physicists including PhD students and early career researchers. They covered the essential elements of theory, modeling and data analysis and featured lectures and tutorials. Students had the opportunity to meet and discuss research topics with their peers together in an informal atmosphere.
Publications.
Proceedings of CESRA workshops include review articles as well as original research articles and are usually published in Solar Physics (journal)'s Topical Issues. The proceedings of some CESRA workshops (until 2004) have been published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Physics.
Solar radio science highlights.
CESRA web page hosts “Solar radio science highlights”. These are short communications written by CESRA members that publicize fresh research (normally based on a refereed paper published within three months) to keep CESRA community informed and up-to-date. They are written in a language accessible to non-experts, using a “news-and-views” style.

Aleena Shaji (born 25 February 2000), better known as, Ivana, is an Indian film actress who has predominantly works in Tamil and Malayalam-language films.
Career.
Aleena began her career as a child actress in the Malayalam film industry through supporting role in "Masters" (2012), before working on "Rani Padmini" (2015), three years later. Aleena then portrayed a pivotal role in "Anuraga Karikkin Vellam" (2016) as the daughter of the lead character. Director Bala had spotted a news article about "Anuraga Karikkun Vellam" online and subsequently chose to cast Aleena in his Tamil film, "Naachiyaar" (2018), which also had Jyothika and G. V. Prakash Kumar in pivotal roles. Bala requested that she should use a stage name which would be easier to pronounce for Tamil audiences, and with the assistance of her cousin, she finalised the name Ivana. In order to prepare for her role, she undertook Tamil classes, while her co-actors assisted and gave her tips when filming certain scenes. Portraying Arasi, a young, innocent girl, Ivana won rave reviews for her performance. Sify.com noted "with and a pretty fresh face and large expressive eyes, Ivana makes a wholly believable Arasi". Likewise, critics from The New Indian Express noted that Ivana makes "an impressive debut", while India Today's reviewer stated that Ivana gives a "splendid performance" and her "expressions are pleasing and pretty convincing".

Diacylglycerol kinase beta

Diacylglycerol kinase beta is a protein that in humans is encoded by the DGKB gene.
Function.
Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) are regulators of the intracellular concentration of the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) and thus play a key role in cellular processes. Nine mammalian isotypes have been identified, which are encoded by separate genes. Mammalian DGK isozymes contain a conserved catalytic (kinase) domain and a cysteine-rich domain (CRD). The protein encoded by this gene is a diacylglycerol kinase, beta isotype. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Ferrari SF71H

The Ferrari SF71H was a Formula One racing car designed and constructed by Scuderia Ferrari to compete during the 2018 FIA Formula One World Championship. The chassis was designed by Mattia Binotto, Simone Resta, Enrico Cardile and David Sanchez with Corrado Iotti leading the powertrain design. The car was driven by Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen, and made its competitive debut at the 2018 Australian Grand Prix.
The SF71H took two wins in the three opening Grands Prix, and set two new track records at the Bahrain International Circuit and the Shanghai International Circuit while qualifying on pole. Thus in these three races the car seemed to be faster than their rivals Mercedes AMG F1 W09 EQ Power+. As of the end of the 2018 championship, the SF71H is Ferrari's most successful car in the hybrid engine era (2014-present), scoring 6 wins (5 by Vettel, 1 by Räikkönen) and 24 podiums, surpassing its predecessor, the SF70H, that had 5 wins and 20 podiums at the end of the 2017 season.
Keeping with his tradition to name his cars, Vettel named his SF71H "Loria". As Santander dropped their sponsorship, the livery features very little white, similar to the livery used in the 2007, 2008, and 2009 cars. At the Japanese Grand Prix, Ferrari introduced a new livery, carrying the logo of Mission Winnow, a joint promotion with major sponsor Philip Morris International.
Design and development.
The SF71H features a longer wheelbase than its predecessor, the SF70H, and a revised cooling system. Ferrari have further evolved their philosophy of moving the crash structure outside the sidepods, creating a complex bargeboard array and sidepod inlet configuration, even including winglets on the rear view mirrors. A small shark fin goes down the engine cover, and supports a low T-wing above the exhaust and spanning almost the entire width of the rear wing.
One of the most significant updates of the season came at the Spanish Grand Prix, where Ferrari changed the way the mirrors were mounted, switching from a "standard" position to having them mounted on the Halo. They also added a winglet above each mirror, but the FIA deemed them illegal, despite claims from the team that they were intended to support the mirrors. Therefore, they were removed at the next race in Monaco.
After being outperformed by Mercedes at the Singapore, Russian and Japanese Grands Prix, Ferrari removed some of their updates at the United States Grand Prix, which allowed them to compete with and beat Mercedes again.
Legacy.
Until the 2020 Belgian Grand Prix, the SF71H driven by Sebastian Vettel held the fastest overall lap record at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps beating that of Neel Jani in the Porsche 919 Evo. The car that beat the SF71H's record is the Mercedes F1 W11. Until the 2020 Italian Grand Prix, the SF71H driven by Kimi Räikkönen held the lap record at Autodromo Nazionale di Monza, beating that of Juan Pablo Montoya in the Williams FW26 and the lap with the highest average speed of . That record was also broken by the Mercedes F1 W11 with an average speed of .

In 2010, he spent five days in Pyongyang, North Korea, with Lord Alton of Liverpool and Baroness Cox of Queensbury, both members of the House of Lords. They met with North Korean officials and summarised their concerns about the nation's human rights abuses. They encouraged officials to invite Marzuki Darusman, who was the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the time, into the country to open prison camps in North Korea to international monitors including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and to suspend executions. In 2011 he co-founded the International Coalition to Stop Crimes Against Humanity in North Korea (ICNK). He has also lived in and travelled to East Timor and China, and previously worked on Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Rogers regularly briefs senior Government ministers and officials, UK members of parliament, the European Union, United Nations officials, US Congressional offices and the State Department on human rights and freedom of religion in Asia. He has also testified in hearings at the House of Commons, the European Parliament, the National Diet of Japan and the United States Congress. He has also organised several investigative humanitarian trips to Burma's borders for British and European parliamentarians.
He is a regular contributor to international media, including "The Wall Street Journal", "International Herald Tribune" and "The Huffington Post". He wrote for the Hong Kong Standard between 2000 and 2002.
Barred entry to Hong Kong.
On 11 October 2017, Rogers was barred entry to Hong Kong. He arrived at Hong Kong International Airport on a flight from Bangkok but was escorted away by immigration officials and placed on a flight back to Thailand. He had previously been warned by a contact in the Chinese embassy in London that he might be refused entry to Hong Kong. Rogers, who lived and worked as a journalist in Hong Kong between 1997 and 2002, has criticised China's increasing threat to democracy in Hong Kong and has campaigned against the imprisonment of pro-democracy activists Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson demanded an explanation from the Hong Kong authorities and the Chinese government. Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, later responded that the move was within China's sovereignty and said: "Whether this person's trip to Hong Kong involved an intention to intervene in Hong Kong's internal affairs and judicial independence – he knows very well himself."
The following day, Rogers announced he would form a non-governmental organisation (NGO) to monitor the rule of law and human rights in Hong Kong. Hong Kong Watch was launched at a reception hosted in Speaker's House, House of Commons in the Parliament of the United Kingdom on 11 December 2017.

Texas Freeman

The Texas Freeman was a newspaper for African Americans established in 1893 in Houston, Texas. It was established by Charles N. Love along with his wife Lilla as well as Jack Tibbitto, and Emmett J. Scott who became its editor. It was the city's first African American newspaper. The paper eventually merged with the "Houston Informer" to become the Houston Informer and Texas Freeman.
The paper criticized Jim Crow laws, sought equal pay for African American teachers, advocated for Houston's Carnegie Library for African Americans, pushed for the hiring of African American postal workers, and opposed segregation. C.N. Love was a leading civil rights activist and advocate for the African American community. He was active in the Republican Party. During his career he was a member of the Republican Party's Black-and-tan faction, then the lily white faction, and sued to end the prohibition on African Americans voting in Democratic Party primaries as he sought for political representation and opportunities for African Americans.
In 1921, Love filed suit against Texas laws barring African Americans from voting. By the time it reached the Supreme Court it was determined to be moot and a political rather than a legal issue (Love v. Griffith).

Everett De Morier

Everett Wayne De Morier (born December 27, 1962) is an American humorist, author, playwright, documentary filmmaker and novelist.
Life and education.
De Morier was born in Binghamton, New York in 1962 to mother Velma and father Lawrence. De Morier spent the first twelve years of his life in the tiny town of Sanitaria Springs, New York, where his mother owned a small tropical fish store called The Mermaid Aquarium. He spent many years after that in the surrounding Binghamton, New York area, which lead him to use this location in his work later on. He graduated from Walton Central High School, Walton, New York in 1981. He also studied Communication at State University of New York at Cortland and Mechanical Engineering at DeVry University.
Lawrence De Morier, Everett's father, died in November 1990, when Everett was twenty-seven. The absence of his father is reflected in many essays he later wrote, including "Father’s Day".
De Morier moved to Dover, Delaware in 2007 where he lives with his wife Deborah J. De Morier (née Wilkins) and they have two children Nicholas and Alexander.
Career.
De Morier started his career as a non-fiction author. His two books, Crib Notes for the First Year of Marriage: A Survival Guide for Newlyweds (1997) and Crib Notes for the First Year of Fatherhood: A Survival Guide for New Fathers (1998), published by Fairview Press, were written, as their names suggest, to help first time husbands and fathers.
De Morier’s most popular work is his first novel Thirty-Three Cecils (2015), published by Blydyn Square Books. The first half of the novel is placed in Binghamton, New York in 1992 and uses real local landmarks including The Belmar Pub and Lanes Deli. Riley 'Dutch' Dutcher, one of the novel's characters, lives in the same apartment at 1 Mather Street that De Morier had in the 1980s.
Thirty-Three Cecils won the top fiction prize at the 2015 London Book Festival and is currently under development as a feature film by Sunset River Productions and is planned for release in 2021. The book was also nominated for The John Gardner Fiction Prize and the Eastern Shore Writers Award.
In 2019, Blydyn Square Books released De Morier’s fourth book, The Invention of Everything: Insights on Life, Food, and One Good Thermos, which was based on the best-of articles De Morier wrote for 543 Magazine.
This release of this book was also used as the framing device for the 2019 documentary Binghamton: Valley of Creativity, which De Morier wrote and helped direct. This documentary premiered at The Bundy Museum Theatre.
De Morier also wrote seven original musical scripts that were all produced and performed by Cornerstone Church of Dover, Delaware: Dover: A Christmas Story (2009 and 2010), A Gift to Remember (2011), Loockerman Letter (2012), The Mollywood Tree (2013), Finding Sergio (2014), A Little of That from Me (2015), and Welcome to Castlewood (2016). He has also written articles for In-Fisherman, Florida Keys, Bride, and Parenting magazines and is editor in chief for 543Magazine.com.

Forges (cartoonist)

Antonio Fraguas de Pablo, better known as Forges (17 January 1942 – 22 February 2018), was a Spanish graphic humorist. His artistic name is based on the translation to Catalan of the word "fraguas".
Biography.
Born in Madrid, was the son of a Catalan mother and Galician father (the writer and journalist Antonio Fraguas Saavedra), was baptized with the name Rafael Antonio Benito Fraguas de Pablo, and spent his childhood in a large family in which he is the second of nine brothers. He was a bad student, but a great reader of Richmal Crompton and her William Brown books. He studied in Madrid high school (at the Cervantes Institute) and telecommunications engineering – which he did not finish – and Social Sciences. In 1956, at age 14, he began working as a telecine technician at Televisión Española and as an image mixer since 1962. He left the TVE staff as a Study Coordinator in 1973 to dedicate himself professionally to graphic humor. He had published his first drawing in 1964 in the newspaper "Pueblo", by the hand of Jesús Hermida, and then went on to "Informaciones". Jesús de la Serna entrusted him with the editorial joke. He did military service as an artillery fighter, and married Pilar Garrido Cendoya and had three daughters and a son; in 1970 he began to collaborate in "Diez Minutos" and worked in the humor magazines "Hermano Lobo", "Por Favor" and "El Jueves", and in the weekly "Sábado Gráfico", "Interviú", "Lecturas", etc.
Since 1982 he published the editorial joke in "Diario 16" and later in "El Mundo", but he left this newspaper after having been one of its seven founders, and in 1995 he went on to sign "El País"'s editorial joke.
In 1992 his novel "Doce de Babilonia" appears. Forges reveals himself as a fairly solid and orderly novelist, although perhaps he is guilty of excessive dependence on graphic humor in the "hooligan" approach to his humorous features. Set in an imaginary Babylon, it narrates the vicissitudes of a group of sages, the twelve Akadémikos, who are persecuted by the High Priest of the city, Okrom, for the hatred that this subject has to any technical, cultural or scientific advance. The protection that King Nebuchadnezzar gives them is not enough to free them from persecution. Ideologically very simple in its approaches, it incurs voluntarily in anachronisms in order to present history as an eternal struggle between Hate and Love, Terror and Humor.
He directed two films ("País S.A.", 1975, and "El bengador Gusticiero y su pastelera madre", 1977) and four humor series on television, El "Muliñandupelicascarabajo" (1968)," Nosotros" (1969) and "24 horas aquí" (1976), on TVE; and "Deforme semanal" (1991), on Telemadrid with his brother José María Fraguas. In radio, he participated in programs such as "Protagonistas", by Luis del Olmo and "La Ventana" by Javier Sardá and Gemma Nierga, and before his death he was on "No es un día cualquiera", by RNE, with Pepa Fernández.
In addition, in 2014 he presented and directed the television program "Pecadores impequeibols" in La 2 de TVE.
He died on 22 February 2018 at 76 years of age in Madrid, a victim of pancreatic cancer.
Style.
As a comedian, he used very personal black-line sandwiches and a stylized language extracted directly from the street. «Inventor» of words and lexical idioms ("gensanta", "stupendo", "bocata", "firulillo", "esborcio", "jobreído", "gürtélido", "tontolcool", etc.), he was one of the few humorists with an ear sensitive to popular language. He also created, graphically, the taco or swearword crossed out in the texts of his drawings, gaining an attenuated lexical expression for some of his characters in a pure popular colloquial language.
Costumbrismo and social criticism occupy a fundamental place in his work. His strength was the critical vision of the situations of daily life. Forges created an extensive iconography of characters and comic situations that reflects the idiosyncrasy and sociology of contemporary Spain:
A substantial part of his work is made up of albums on the history of Spain in comics and on computers for clumsy. He affirmed that in Spain it does not take inspiration to be a humorist. In 2007 he took part in the tribute book to Uderzo (current author of Asterix and Obelix), on the occasion of his eightieth birthday, an album in which 30 artists of the world comic have drawn adventures of the aforementioned characters, but with their respective styles.
In 2008 he proposed to Spanish institutions the possibility of obtaining the support of graphic humorists from around the world to the UN Millennium Goals, a proposal that was officially presented at the Instituto Cervantes in New York in October of that year, on the occasion of the General Assembly of the United Nations, under the sponsorship of the Government and the technical support of the EFE Agency of Spain, showing to the media accredited before the high international organization, a DVD containing the explicit commitment of support for the dissemination of the referred Millennium Goals, by some of the main Ibero-American graphic humorists, as the initial coordinated action of the project.
In 2012, and on the proposal of the academic faculty of the University of Alcalá de Henares, he was appointed Technical Director of the Instituto Quevedo del Humor, the first specific university center founded in Spain to study humor in all its facets.

Frieder Lippmann

Frieder Lippmann (born 3 September 1936) is a German politician (SPD). He is a former member of the East German national parliament ("Volkstag") and of the regional parliament ("Landtag") of Thuringia.
Life.
Provenance and early years.
Frieder Lippmann was born into a working-class family at Dorfchemnitz, a small town in the Eastern Ore Mountain region ("Osterzgebirge"), a short distance to the north of the German frontier with what had recently become known as the Czechoslovak Sudetenland. His grand father had been a committed member of the Social Democratic Party, but had died when Lippmann was only ten, leaving the boy to find his own way to an interest in politics only many years later.
War ended in May 1945, putting an end to the Nazi régime and leaving the central portion of Germany administered as the Soviet occupation zone, to be relaunched and rebranded in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Lippmann attended school locally between 1943 and 1955, the year in which he passed his school final exams ("Abitur"), an exam result which in due course would clear the path to university level education. For the next five years he worked in the region's coal and ore mines. Sources describe him as a coal face worker. Nevertheless, there was also the opportunity to study, and in 1960 he emerged from the Zwickau with and engineering degree.
Between 1960 and 1965 he worked as a middle manager ("... im Steigerdienst") at the at Schmiedefeld, in the southern part of Thuringia. He combined this with a correspondence study course from the Freiberg Mining Academy. Sources are silent as to whether this led to further qualifications, but in 1965 it was followed by new job responsibilities. Between 1965 and 1990 Lippmann worked successively as an academic assistant, project engineer and group leader. Subsequently, he was involved in project planning at the Research Institute for Pig Iron Production and the Construction Institute at Unterwellenborn.
Politics.
East Germany under Ulbricht and Honecker was a very different place from Germany under Hitler, but it was still a one-party dictatorship. Popular backing for the government could never be taken for granted. There is no sign that Lippmann ever joined the ruling party. He himself stated later that he came to politics through the media, and he identified with leading Social Democrats through watching political debates on television. In East Germany the Social Democratic Party had been forcibly subsumed into the ruling party back in 1946, and it is not clear which leading Social Democrats he had in mind with this comment. It is certainly the case that comrades living near the Inner German border would, under some circumstances, have been able (illegally) to watch television programmes from West Germany, where the SPD was one of the two largest mainstream political parties. From the media and / or from less formal information sources, Lippmann was well aware of the Charter 77 civic initiative in nearby Czechoslovakia, the rise of "Solidarity" in neighbouring Poland through the 1980s and of the "Place of Heavenly Peace" atrocities in June 1989. He was appalled by the reaction of East Germany's ruling SED party and the "Bloc parties" which it controlled, which celebrated the suppression of student protests in Tiananmen Square in ways which "no honest person understood" ("... was kein ehrlicher Mensch verstand"). For Lippmann, that became a defining moment for East Germany's own unfolding "peaceful revolution" of 1989/90.
During the German Democratic Republic's final decade, as the winds of Glasnost blew across from, of all places, Moscow, the East German government experienced a progressive loss of confidence: towards the later 1980s the country saw a surge in street protests. This was a reflection of political discussions taking place in homes, out of reach, as the participants would have hoped, of government informers. Late one night in early September 1989, ten people with an interest in improving the political situation in East Germany met together in the shed in Frieder Lippmann's garden. They all had so-called "technical" backgrounds which, participants believed, reduced the risk that one of them would be a Stasi informer. There were no informers present (though two would later leave the group). They discussed their political aspirations for their country, including the introduction of a parliamentary democracy with free and fair elections. They discussed a return to the federal administrative structure that had disappeared in 1952 when the centralising preferences of the politburo had led to the abolition of the state-level tier of government. They even discussed the idea of some sort of confederation with West Germany. (It never occurred to any of them that full reunification between East and West Germany might become a possibility.) Although what they were discussing amounted to a radical political programme, there was no ambition at this point to go so far as to found a Social Democratic Party in what remained, as far as those present understood, a one-party state. There was a remarkable level of agreement on a future trajectory for East Germany, but they aspired only to create a group similar to those that had been beginning to form under the auspices of various parish churches, concerning themselves with environmental issues and political freedoms. With this in mind, the participants in the garden shed meeting now held several further meetings.
Those subsequent meetings were consciously non-conspiratorial in spirit, but it was nevertheless quickly concluded that creating a political party would be a more effective way of progressing. Events elsewhere suggested that such a move might actually be becoming possible. Then, towards the end of October, news came through that an East German Social Democratic Party had been founded at Schwante, just outside Berlin. Members of Lippmann's group set about making contact with members of similar groups in neighbouring towns. He started by meeting up with Simone Manz, a dentist in Rudolstadt: they agreed to stay in touch. Studiously casual encounters took place with embryonic SDP groups from nearby Greiz, Gera, Pößneck und Saalfeld. In October 1989 Lippmann, like many others, joined the re-emerging (East German) Social Democratic Party. In November 1989 protesters broke through the Berlin Wall, and it quickly became clear that the Soviet troops had received no instructions from Moscow to undertake a fraternal intervention and put a stop to political developments on the East Berlin streets, as their predecessors had done back in 1953 (or, more recently in Czechoslovakia, in 1968). By the end of 1989 Lippmann had become chair of the SDP's Saalfeld group. In January 1990 the new party held its first national congress at Gotha, followed by a political rally in the town square at which Lippmann, standing crushed with others in the crowd, had the surreal experience of being able to cheer Willy Brandt. That month he became SPD chair for the Saalfeld sub-region. Later that year he became deputy chair of the regional party executive for the Saalfeld-Rudolstadt district.
East Germany's first (and as matters turned out last) free and fair general election took place in March 1990. For the first time since the founding of the state, results were reported that showed the ruling SED party receiving fewer than 99% of the votes cast. (They received 16.4%.) No party won an overall majority, but the leading party, the CDU achieved 40.8% of the vote. The SDP were in second place with 21.9%. Frieder Lippmann was listed in third place on his party's candidate list for the Gera electoral district: his name was high enough up on the list to secure him a seat in the resulting national parliament ("Volkskammer"). On 13 January 1990 the East German SDP had changed its name to SPD, in anticipation of an ever-closer collaboration with the West German SPD (although actual fusion tool place only on 26 September 1990). In February 1990 Oskar Lafontaine the leader of the West German party gave a speech to a party congress in which he urged caution over a possible "German reunification". Lafontaine was still convinced that, from a western perspective, was simply unaffordable. Lippmann was horrified, and believed that Lafontaine's attitude would be damaging to the party's prospects in the East German election in March. He was therefore surprised to find himself elected, and experienced seven months of "grand coalition" government during which east-west tensions within the SPD were far more obvious than for their partners, the centre-right CDU. Lippmann remained till October 1990 when, in the context of reunification, the parliament was subsumed into an enlarged version of the (hitherto West) German Bundestag. As part of the arrangements agreed, 144 of the 400 Volkskammer members - including 33 from the SDP - transferred to the enlarged Bundestag, but Lippmann was not among them.
During 1990 Lippmann also became a member of the SPD party executive for Thuringia, which was formally reinstated as a federal state ("Bundesland") in October. The restoration of Thuringia's status as a political region was accompanied by the return of the regional parliament ("Landtag"). Elections were held on 14 October 1990: Frieder Lippmann was one of the elected to membership of the 88 seat legislature. The second election to the Landtag took place on 16 October 1994 and was a triumph for the Thuringian SPD which saw the number of its seats increase from 21 : this led to participation with the CDU in a governing coalition. Lippmann became leader of the SPD group in the Landtag, retaining the position till 1999. After the next election, in 1999 the party was reduced to 18 of the 88 seats, and Lippmann stepped down from his leadership position, while attributing the disappointing result to the national economic situation. Leadership of the SPD in the Landtag passed to Heiko Gentzel, a man who later described Frieder Lippmann as "the best human being he ever came across in the entire party" ("der sei vom Menschlichen her das Tollste, was ihm in der SPD je begegnet ist."). The respect was presumably mutual, since between 1999 and 2004 Lippmann spoke for the party on economic policy in the Landtag.
Personal.
Frieder Lippmann is married with two children. There are also grandchildren.

C.N. Love

Charles Norton Love (died 1946) was a pioneering newspaper publisher and civil rights activist in Houston, Texas. Love became a leading civil rights activist and advocate for the African American community. The Love's paper, the "Texas Freeman" criticized Jim Crow laws, sought equal pay for African American teachers, advocated for Houston's Carnegie Library for African Americans, pushed for the hiring of African American postal workers, and opposed segregation. He was active in the Republican Party and was a member of the Black-and-tan faction, then the lily white faction, and eventually sued to end the prohibition on African Americans voting in primaries held by the Democratic Party (the dominant party in Texas at the time). He steadfastly sought out political representation and other opportunities for African Americans.
Love established the "Navasota Echo" in the countryside. After it closed, He launched the "Texas Freeman" newspaper in Houston in 1893 and published its first issue with his wife Lilla. The paper condemned discrimination, while advocating for equal pay, job opportunities, and against voting restrictions facing African Americans in Texas. He sued when Texas passed a law prohibiting African Americans from voting in 1923 after a series of local measures restricting their voting rights. African Americans were prohibited from membership in the Democratic Party in Texas.
Love was tall, slender, terribly near-sighted and albino. Love was attacked by arsonists at his home and shot in the streets. He survived to see the Democratic Party of Texas finally admit African Americans in the 1940s. He died in 1943 and is buried in Paradise Cemetery in Acres Homes.

Joseph Taylor (folk singer)

Joseph Taylor (18331910), was a folk singer from Saxby-All-Saints, Lincolnshire, England, who became known due to the attention of the pianist, composer and musicologist, Percy Grainger.
Taylor was the first English folk-singer to be commercially recorded.
Career.
Taylor worked as a farm bailiff and sang for pleasure, as well as in his local church choir, and in competitions.
Some time between 1906 and 1908, Grainger visited Lincolnshire and recorded Taylor, who was already in his 70s, and other singers of traditional songs, onto wax cylinders, using an Edison Bell-made phonograph.
In 1908, Grainger was instrumental in the Gramophone Company inviting Taylor to London, where a dozen of his songs were recorded, with nine subsequently being released on a series of seven gramophone discs, on the "His Master's Voice label, as part of a series billed as "Percy Grainger's Collection of English Folk-Songs sung by Genuine Peasant Performers". In the accompanying booklet, Grainger wrote:
The British Library Sound Archive describes these releases as:
Grainger's recordings and transcriptions of Taylors's singing came to the attention of the composer Frederick Delius, who requested and secured permission to use Grainger's harmonies in his own arrangement of one of Taylor's songs, "Brigg Fair". Taylor was a guest at the first performance, at the Queen's Hall in London, and reputedly stood to sing along. Grainger's own folksong-inspired "Lincolnshire Posy" (1940) was dedicated by the composer, to "the singers who sang so sweetly to me".
Later releases and archives.
Ten of Taylor's Gramophone Company recordings were released, as "Brigg Fair: Joseph Taylor and Other Traditional Lincolnshire Singers" (Leader LEA4050) by Leader Records in 1972, alongside recordings, of Taylor and others, transferred from Grainger's wax cylinders.
Grainger's wax cylinders were copied onto lacquer discs by the Library of Congress in around 1940. The British Library digitised their set of these discs in 2018 and has made them available online.
Personal life.
Taylor had a son, John, and a daughter, Mary. Mary was interviewed about her father's singing by Peter Kennedy in 1953. The recording is kept by the British Library and is available online.
Legacy.
Some of the songs performed by Taylor and recorded by Grainger became part of the canon of the British folk revival. Martin Carthy recorded several.
Songs.
Songs performed by Taylor, and recorded by Grainger, included:

Catherine Pine

Catherine Emily Pine (7 May 1864 – 14 August 1941) was active in the women's suffrage movement in Britain. She took care of the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst and her son Henry. Pine travelled with Pankhurst until she decided to move back to Britain permanently in 1924.
Family and education.
Catherine Emily Pine was born on 7 May 1864. Her parents were Robert Pine, a corn merchant, and his wife, Anne Bret. Catherine trained to be a nurse; she who supported the woman's suffrage movement by working as the Pankhurst family's personal nursing assistant. Pine attended a school for nursing and trained as a nurse at St Bartholomew's Hospital between 1895 and 1897. After qualification she remained until she was promoted to Hospital Sister in 1900.
Career and support for suffragettes.
Pine opened a clinic in 1907 in Pembridge Gardens, Notting Hill, London, working with Nurse Catherine Townend, where suffragettes who had gone on hunger strike in prison were taken after being released. Pankhurst was one of the imprisoned suffragettes that underwent care of at the nursing home. Pine also took care of Pankhurst's son, until he died in 1910.
Relationship with the Pankhursts.
When Pine first started working at her nursing home, she took care of Pankhurst's son, Henry, who was there because of an inflammation of the bladder. Pankhurst soon viewed Pine as a friend and a competent nurse. Pine worked in the home procured by the Pankhurst at Tower Cressy, Camden Hill but was not in sympathy with the Montessori teaching methods used by Jenny (Jane) Kenney for the children there. When Pine and the Pankhursts went to Paris in early 1919, for a scene change while Emmeline worked for the suffrage movement. That September, they sailed to the United States and Canada, although Emmeline longed to go home, she knew she had a job to do with Catherine. A lot of the time, Emmeline was not at home, so Pine was charged with the duties of taking care of Pankhurst's children. 
Suffragette Medal.
Pine was given a suffragettes medal and left it to the British College of Nursing, but her library and mementos were given to the Museum of London

The Rheingold

"The Rheingold" is the seventh episode of the of the American fantasy television series "", and the 119th episode overall. The episode was written by R. J. Stewart and directed by John Fawcett; it first aired on November 13, 2000. The series, set in Ancient Greece, focuses on Xena (Lucy Lawless), a ruthless warrior seeking redemption for her past actions. Throughout her adventures, she is accompanied by her best friend &amp; soulmate (Renee O'Connor), who assists her in recognizing and pursuing the greater good.
In the episode, upon meeting a warrior named Beowulf, Xena decides to travel to the Norselands without to right one of past misdeeds. Deciding to go after her, Gabrielle meets a woman named Brunnhilda who explains the actions Xena took while in the Norselands, which involved meeting Odin and becoming one of his Valkyries.
Upon airing, the episode received positive reviews from critics and alongside its two succeeding episodes, which form the "Ring Trilogy" have often been singled out as one of the best episodes of the show's sixth season. Praise went to Lawless' portrayal of "Evil Xena" during flashbacks as well as the usage of Norse mythology, "Beowulf" and "Das Rheingold". The episode was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series.
Plot.
In a flashback taking place 35 years ago, Xena is shown crafting a ring and then fighting a monster. Wearing the ring, Xena claims she's invincible but just as she pushes the monster into a cage, it succeeds in taking the ring off of her finger. Xena locks the cage using a lock with two ravens crafted into it and leaves confident that the monster will never get out.
In the present, while Xena and are eating at a tavern, a man from the Norselands named Beowulf shows Xena a broken lock, with the depiction of two ravens in it. Troubled, she keeps quiet to Gabrielle and sneaks away in the morning, leaving a note for her. In the note, Xena implies she is on a suicide mission, warns Gabrielle to stay behind, and ends with a heartfelt farewell. Despite Xena's wishes, Gabrielle sets out to follow her.
As Gabrielle enters the land of the Asgardian gods, she discovers a woman named Brunnhilda, who knows Xena and can share the legends of Xena from the Norselands with Gabrielle. Apparently, on her way back from Chin, Xena came to the Norselands and met Odin. Lusting for power, she became a Valkyrie in his service but tricked him into disclosing the location of the Rheingold, much to the dismay of Grinhilda, who was the leader of the Valkyries before Xena came along. Here, the meaning behind the opening flashback is revealed. The Rheingold is a mystical gold that Xena crafted into a ring to make her invincible. Upon hearing that Xena is moving up the Rhein River in search of the Rhein Maidens and the Rheingold, Grinhilda angrily confronts Odin and takes off with her brigade to stop Xena. A battle ensues, in which Xena kicks Grinhilda unconscious. Back in the present, when Gabrielle mentions Beowulf and the lock, Brunnhilda declares that Xena has embarked on a "suicide mission".
Meanwhile, Xena, hiking along the Rhein River with Beowulf, lapses into a series of flashbacks of her swimming with three Rhein Maidens. Convincing the First Rhein Maiden to take her to the Rheingold, she's led to an underwater cavern where the Maiden points out a box concealing the infamous gold. When the Maiden warns her not to touch it, Xena cruelly tosses her aside, declaring that the Rheingold can do her no harm since she's already forsaken love. Xena melts the gold and molds a powerful ring from it.
Xena and Beowulf approach a house with bloody limbs strewn about the yard. They enter and wait for the beast to emerge. Meanwhile, Brunnhilda briefs Gabrielle on Grindl, the creature Xena locked up more than three decades earlier in the mine. Brunnhilda explains that legend has it that Grindl was once a loving creature, but finally gave up love after such a lengthy imprisonment and was then able to use the power of the ring to escape. Inside the house, Grindl attacks Xena and Beowulf mercilessly.
When Gabrielle and Brunnhilda finally arrive, they find a bloody Beowulf, who sadly tells them that Xena was hauled off by the monster. Gabrielle finds Xena's bloody breastplate.
Production.
The 43-minutes, 55-seconds episode was written by R. J. Stewart and directed by John Fawcett.
Broadcast and release.
"The Rheingold" was first broadcast on syndication on November 13, 2000. During its original broadcast, the episode received an average audience (AA) Nielsen rating of 3.4.

This marked a continuation in viewership from the previous episode, "The Abyss", which also earned a rating of 3.4.

Reception.
Critical response.
The episode received generally positive reviews from critics who praised it, along with the next two episodes, as one of the best of the show's sixth season. Sergio Non of IGN stated that "The Rheingold"—along with the rest of "The Ring Trilogy"—was the high point of season six and praised the combination of "Beowulf" and "Das Rheingold" being incorporated into the story. Non also reacted favorably to the flashbacks which presented Xena's evil past. Similarly, Don Houston of DVD Talk described the episode and story arc as one of the most notable from season six, praising its thematic value. Andrew Younger of "Den of Geek!" expressed similar sentiments, describing the trilogy as "epic" and saying that it proved the show could still "dazzle and inspire".
Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation described the episode as "lots of fun". She praised the flashbacks depicting Xena as a villain, saying that she always enjoyees seeing "her seduce, battle, and overshadow the great heroes of mythology", as well as her seduction of the Rhein maidens. Green also praised Lucy Lawless, stating the even without taking the character's wardrobe into consideration, one can always tell when Lawless is playing Xena as a villain solely through her facial expressions. "Xenaville" gave the episode a score of 9/10 stars.
Accolades.
For this episode, Joseph LoDuca was nominated a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series at the 53rd Primetime Emmy Awards but lost to the " episode ". "The Rheingold", alongside its two succeeding episodes, also won a Bemmie Award (IGN's self-proclaimed equivalent to the Academy Awards) for best episode / story arc of 2000.

Pamela Enderby

Pamela Mary Enderby FRCSLT, , (born 25 January 1949) is a British Speech Therapist and Professor of Community Rehabilitation at the University of Sheffield.
Career.
In 1975 Enderby became Head of the Speech Therapy Department at Frenchay Hospital. In 1983 she gained her PhD from Bristol University Medical School. In 1986 she became Head of the Frenchay District Speech Therapy Services.
Enderby was chair and Vice President of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, of which she is a Fellow, in 1993–1994 and President of the Society for Research and Rehabilitation from 1994 to 1996. She has led research programmes into various aspects of therapy, particularly related to models of delivery, and effectiveness and outcomes. She is currently non-executive Director of South Yorkshire Health Authority and chairperson of the Regional Older Peoples´ Task Force. She is on the editorial advisory board for the International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders. Enderby is an Emeritus Professor of Community Rehabilitation at The School of Health and Related Research at The University of Sheffield. In June 2019 Enderby was the keynote speaker at the International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders Annual Lecture.
Awards.
In 1986 Enderby was awarded the Jacques Parisot Foundation Fellowship Award presented by the World Health Organization. Enderby was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University of West England in December 2000 in recognition of her outstanding contribution to speech and language therapy and to rehabilitation research.
Enderby was awarded an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours 2018.
Equal pay activism.
Enderby was the lead claimant in a landmark legal case for equal pay in the NHS (see Enderby v Frenchay Health Authority). In 1986 she argued that her work and that of her colleagues, mostly women, was of equal value to clinical psychologists, who were predominantly men. Her employers said the difference in pay could be justified because the two groups bargain separately. This claim launched the second longest group action for equal pay for equal work since a 1985 claim by female canteen workers against British Coal. The case involved twenty-six court appearances (including at the European Court of Justice), 2,000 applicants and sixteen test cases.
The resulting compensation cost the government approximately £30 million in back-pay. The Enderby case led the then Labour government to institute a review of pay and grading scales throughout the health service in the form of the Agenda for Change.

Dittert conjecture

The Dittert conjecture, or Dittert–Hajek conjecture, is a mathematical hypothesis (in combinatorics) concerning the maximum achieved by a particular function formula_1 of matrices with real, nonnegative entries satisfying a summation condition. The conjecture is due to Eric Dittert and (independently) Bruce Hajek.
Let formula_2 be a square matrix of order formula_3 with nonnegative entries and with formula_4. Its permanent is defined as formula_5, where the sum extends over all elements formula_6 of the symmetric group. 
The Dittert conjecture asserts that the function formula_7 defined by formula_8 is (uniquely) maximized when formula_9, where formula_10 is defined to be the square matrix of order formula_3 with all entries equal to 1.

William Cecil Clayton

William Cecil Clayton is a recurring fictional character in Edgar Rice Burroughs's series of Tarzan novels and in adaptations of the saga to other media, particularly comics.
In the novels.
William Cecil Clayton is a paternal cousin of John Clayton (Tarzan), whom he much resembles, and holder of the title of Lord Greystoke to which the latter is rightful heir. William serves as contrast to Tarzan, representing what the Ape-Man would likely have become had he led a normal life rather than being raised by apes, and is his rival for the affections of Jane Porter.
He first appeared in the initial Tarzan novel, "Tarzan of the Apes" (1912) and reappeared in the second book, "The Return of Tarzan" (1913), and the sixth, "Jungle Tales of Tarzan" (1916/17).
When Tarzan's parents are lost in Africa and presumed deceased, the older John Clayton's title passes to the line of his younger brother and thence to his nephew William, who holds it at the time we meet him in "Tarzan of the Apes". William is portrayed as a well-meaning but ineffectual person with a romantic interest in Jane Porter, a member of the party marooned in Africa together with the Porters. When the castaways encounter Tarzan, William pales in comparison to the Ape Man, who is shown to both the reader and Jane be physically and morally superior. While feeling himself outclassed, the party's subsequent return to civilization leaves William free to pursue his suit with Jane, who ultimately accepts him. When Tarzan later reappears he learns they are engaged, and realizing that William's title, wealth, and culture make him a more appropriate spouse for Jane, accepts the fact. Tarzan's subsequent discovery that he himself is the rightful Lord Greystoke does not alter his assessment, and he conceals the revelation from both William and Jane.
In "The Return of Tarzan", William is revealed to have found the discarded document that disclosed Tarzan's true identity and kept the knowledge to himself, fearing it will cost him his status and Jane. He presses her to set a date, which she, still emotionally torn between him and Tarzan, is reluctant to do. A subsequent return to Africa does nothing to improve his standing in her eyes, though his fundamental decency is highlighted in an ordeal in a lifeboat with two other castaways. When the boat finally reaches shore the starving William is abandoned by the other survivor, the villainous Nikolas Rokoff, and subsequently succumbs to fever. Dying, he redeems himself by confessing his selfish concealment of Tarzan's identity and renouncing his claim on her to Tarzan.
In the short story "The Witch Doctor Seeks Vengeance," which appears in the later but chronologically earlier book "Jungle Tales of Tarzan", William appears unnamed in a scene contrasting his privileged, civilized existence with the primitive existence of the young Tarzan. William does not shine in the comparison.
In other media.
The character of William Cecil Clayton has appeared in adaptations of the original novels in the syndicated comic strip "Tarzan" and in "Tarzan" comic books, in a portrayal essentially faithful to Burroughs's conception.
William also appeared in such early Tarzan silent films as "The Romance of Tarzan" (1918) and "The Adventures of Tarzan" (1921), in which he was played by Colin Kenny and Scott Pembroke, respectively.
Later Tarzan films "Tarzan the Ape Man" (1932) and "Tarzan and His Mate" (1934) subsume his role into that of the adventurer Harry Holt, portrayed by Neil Hamilton. (Holt also appears in the 1959 and 1981 remakes of the 1932 film, played by Cesare Danova and John Phillip Law respectively.)
The Disney animated film "Tarzan" (1999) presents a "Clayton" character who owes little to William Cecil Clayton but his name, being more a conflation of the earlier films' Holt (in his explorer aspect) and the novels' Rokoff (in his villainous aspect).

Alloteuthis media

Alloteuthis media, the midsize squid or little squid is a species of squid in the family Loliginidae from the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. It is generally a by catch species in trawl fisheries, although there is an active fishery in the western Mediterranean.
Description.
"Alloteuthis media" is hard to tell apart from "Alloteuthis subulata". The arms and tentacles of "A.media" are proportionately slender compared to "A. subulata" but the two species are best separated by the lateral edge of the mantle, which in "A. media" extends into a short pointed tail of up to 10mm in length in adults. It grows to a total body length of 200 mm long, with a maximum mantle length of 120mm and the females being larger than the males, with the length of the heart-shaped fins, including the tail, is less than a half the length of the mantle. The hear shape of the fins is produced by their convex anterior ends and then their narrowing posterior edges which become part of the pointed tail The tentacular club is broad and the diameter of the largest of the suckers in the club is 9-14 % of the width of head. The pairs of suckers in the centre of the club are attached at almost right angles to the axis of the club. In males the hectocotylus is on the Left ventral arm which typically has 11 normal suckers in a ventral row (plus or minus 1), with papillae towards the tip. Sexual maturity is reached in females when they attain about 95mm in length and 55mm in males.
Distribution.
"Alloteuthis media" occurs in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, reported as having a southern limit at Cape Blanc, around 20°N, and a northern one at 60°N in the eastern Atlantic. It is rare in the North Sea with records from the Irish Sea and English Channel on the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. More recently it has not been recorded north of the Iberian Peninsula In the Mediterranean Sea it is widespread and its distribution includes the Sea of Marmara.
Biology.
"Alloteuthis media" is found over occurs on sandy and muddy substrates and prefers waters between 0 and 200m in depth in coastal areas and over the continental shelf, although a maximum depth of 500m has been recorded. It undertakes seasonal migrations between offshore and coastal waters, similar to other neritic species of squid. Spawning is continuous in the western Mediterranean but peaks of mature adults can be discerned, the early on in February when large individuals can be found at depths of 150-200m and these begin to move into shallow to spawn over sandy substrates in March and April, spawning occurs to a lesser among beds of "Posidonia" sea grass. The later spawning group, is made up of smaller individuals than the earlier group and they migrate onshore during June and July and spawn later in the year. Depending on the water temperature the squid return to deeper waters by late autumn. In the northern Tyrrhenian Sea there are also two peaks of spawning activity, the early one in May and the later in September. Sexual maturity is attained at a variety of size ranges, as seen in other Mediterranean cephalopods, with the eastern populations maturing at smaller mantle lengths than the western. In the eastern Mediterranean the smallest mature females have a mantle length of 37mm, the smallest mature males have one of 32mm while in the western part of that sea the smallest mature females have mantle lengths of 80 mm while that of the smallest mature females measures 50 mm. Females in the eastern basin lay more eggs than those in the west and the eggs they lay are larger which suggests that this species has a higher reproductive productivity in the eastern Mediterranean compared to the western. The male's spermatophores vary between 2.3 and 3.4mm in length and each male bears no more than 170 spermatophores. The females lay the eggs several batches and they are held in short, gelatinous capsules, similar to the capsules of "Loligo vulgaris", but less robust and transparent rather than opaque. The egg clusters, each containing up to 1400 eggs, are adhered to hard objects on the sea bed such as shells, corals and stones). "Alloteuthis media" is a predator which uses crustaceans, molluscs and small fishes as prey. Their life cycle is estimated to be around a year for males and eighteen months for females.
Taxonomy.
Recent molecular analyses suggest that "Alloteuthis media" and "A. subulata" may be conspecific and that they are the extreme ends of a morphological gradient. In which case the name "Alloteuthis media" applied by Carl Linnaeus in his "Systema Naturae" in 1758 would have priority over Jean Baptiste Lamarck's "A. subulata" which dates from 1798. However, further analyses suggest that these are indeed two sister species which can be reliably separated by the size of the central suckers of the tentacular club and that in fact there is a genetic divergence between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean populations of "A. media".
Fisheries.
"Alloteuthis media" is normally a bycatch in trawl fisheries for other species but it is marketed throughout most of the Mediterranean with other "Alloteuthis" species. In the western Mediterranean it is actively fished for in a trawl fishery and in the winter it is captured at depths of 150m to 200m and from between 50m and 150m in spring, summer and autumn. Its seasonal abundance varies widely, but there is little annual variation. Commercial interest in this species varies according to location and the catch is marketed in both fresh and frozen forms.

Bellsdyke Hospital

Bellsdyke Hospital, also known as Stirling District Lunatic Asylum ('SDLA') or Stirling District Asylum, is a former psychiatric hospital at Larbert, Falkirk that was opened in June 1869 and largely closed in 1997. It was an asylum set up by the Stirling District Lunacy Board.
History.
Early history.
Stirling District Lunacy Board formed in 1848: those on the board began to make plans to build another building to cope with the large number of inmates in the asylums in Stirlingshire and the counties that surround it. The Falkirk Poorhouse, which had been built in 1850, was unable to cope with the number of inmates it held which had led to overcrowding and this, in turn, led to the decision of a new asylum being built.
In an Act of Parliament of 1858 saw that district asylums were to be built and maintained by the authorities of the county, £25 per year was paid by the Parish Council for every patient sent by the Parish to the asylum. The friends and relatives of the inmates often contributed to the costs of the stay in the asylum. However, even those from respectable homes were referred to as 'pauper lunatics' due to their dependency on the State-run asylums.
The sum of £40,000 was set aside for the asylum, and the architect for the building was William Stirling III, whose previous works are also in the Falkirk area. The building was to be built on the Gowkhill Estate, with it being a mere coincidence that the old Scots word gowk means cuckoo. The estate was bought from Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Dundas of Carron Hall, son of Thomas Dundas. The asylum would be adjacent to the newly opened Scottish Imbecile Institution, or as it was latterly known the Royal Scottish National Hospital.
During the building of the asylum, there were issues that delayed the asylum opening mainly due to problems with the water and gas on the site. William Stirling III never saw his work completed as he died in February 1869, James Brown completed the building of the asylum and it was opened as the Stirling District Lunatic Asylum in June 1869. The asylum consisted of two large buildings that consisted of a chapel, male and female dormitories and a dining-room. The asylum was meant to house two hundred and fifty inmates, but issues with overcrowding meant that there were several additions to the original buildings. The inmates came from the counties of Clackmannan, Dumbarton, Stirlingshire and Linlithgow. The first superintendent of the asylum was Dr Frederick Skae of Morningside.
During the first few years of the asylum being open, it was mentioned in a debate in the House of Commons as an example of how an efficient asylum should be run. This reputation was due to the change in treatment that was happening at this point in history which the SDLA implemented.
1876–1883.
Dr James McLaren was appointed as superintendent in 1876; he continued to promote understanding of the inmate as a treatment rather than the use of force. The SDLA had no walled exercise as of 1879 when the female walled exercise court was turned into a drying green and the inmates enjoyed regular dances and concerts with those that were able working in the garden, laundry and farm on the asylums grounds. Physical activity was seen as a benefit to the inmates and many inmates helped at the laundry, gardens, and in the kitchens.
The Succursal block was built in 1882; the extra room was for convalescents with a limited number of places available for private patients who paid a fee for their place.
Dr MacLaren was the first to introduce a fully trained nurse to the SDLA in 1882.
1889–1898.
Dr John Macpherson was appointed as superintendent in 1889; he disapproved of the inmates being thought of as state prisoners and began to push for the inmates to be referred to and be treated as a patient instead. Macpherson pushed for patients to have intensive medical treatment as they would at a hospital which led to the expansion of the Chronic block which changed the shape of the original asylum. In 1891, it was noted that the works of the Falkirk and Larbert Water District had led to the Board to decide to update the plumbing of the SDLA, this was a favourable measure as previously there had not been enough water for the sanitary needs of the asylum. Toilets, bathrooms and water closets were all renovated or new ones installed so that used water and sewage were not being pumped into the nearby stream. Instead, the used water and sewage were chemically treated and then filtered in sewage tanks. The old administrative section of the asylum was repurposed into a General Store, and a new administrative block was built. A new dairy and laundry were also built as the previous buildings were too small.
In 1892, the cost of a patients admission went from £27 10s to £25, a bakery was added to the asylum which had the capability of producing 1000 loaves a day and the dining halls, in the main building, were extended to allow for the patients to all eat with one another.
Upon the day of the Chronic block opening on the 26th of July 1893, Dr Macpherson said in his speech that the SDLA was the first institution in the world which had adopted this attitude. two English asylums were about to take on the same practices as the SDLA by 1894.
The Chronic block was built for acute cases. Also, kitchens were added, and a telephone system was installed throughout the asylum. Dr Macpherson's treatment focused on soothing colours, pleasant surroundings and a dignified attitude towards clothing and hygiene helped towards the progress of the patients. Eighty patients were housed in the new block on the 14th of August 1893, however, nine months later the asylum was close to being at capacity once more. Renovation work was needed in parts of the hospital and patients had worked to create some of the roads around the asylum, and also a new cricket ground was made.
Overcrowding was still an issue, and a further extension was added to the Chronic block so that another one hundred and ninety patients could be housed. An officer was appointed to locate suitable outside boarding for those that were more tractable cases.
1904–1933.
Dr George Robertson was appointed superintendent, he was an important figure in the field of mental health and brought the asylum closer to becoming a hospital. Robertson increased the practice of having fully trained nurses on the site that had previously been started by Dr McLaren. Dr Robertson did find it difficult to recruit young Victorian ladies into the nursing profession as it was not viewed as a respectable, to counter this view Dr Robertson provided the same extensive training that was applied to other branches of the medical profession. The structure of how the asylum was run changed when the appointment of a matron and six assistant matrons took place in 1905.
By 1906, nurses were required to train on a three-year course to gain a, 'Certificate for Proficiency in Mental Nursing'. A sanatorium for males and a separate for females opened on the 21st of February 1906; the wards had their windows constantly opened to allow fresh air to circulate around the patients with consumption. After selling Kersebrock farm due to how far it was from the asylum, new land was purchased on South Inches farm which ran along the south-west border of the asylum.
In 1907, a new block was opened to house the large numbers of female nursing staff; the SDLA now had three blocks; the hospital block, the block for those that could do light work and the block for the, 'feeble and senile'. There were over seven hundred patients by 1914, and the problem of overcrowding was an issue again as there were more cases requiring treatment than the admission rates allowed for. In 1915, a new block was built to house more patients.
In August 1908, Dr Robert Campbell took over the position as superintendent of the asylum. The patient's regularly worked in the garden, the gardens were often expanded to allow for more of the patients to get involved and more farmland was being sought by 1909 to allow for more patients to help on the farm also. The Asylum Officers' Superannuation Act of 1909, was operational as of the 15th of May, 1910. This act allowed those that were asylum officials and servants to retire at the age of 55 or 60 as long as they paid in weekly to the fund.
In 1911, the burgh of Falkirk proposed to extend its borders their proposal meant that the asylum would go from being in Stirling district to Falkirk district. The Board for the Asylum did not want this to happen as the taxes for the asylum would rise if they were to be incorporated into the Falkirk district. The greenhouses were replaced in 1911 and fire alarms were fitted throughout the asylum, the new piggery was also completed. The patients also performed in a concert, and theatrical performance was held in the winter of 1911.
In 1912, the burgh of Falkirk petitioned for the SDLA to be included in their burgh, but again they were denied. The profits from the Asylum shop were used to purchase a large magic lantern and cinematograph; this allowed the patients to have frequent cinematograph displays. As it was the Coronation year of George the Fifth, a special dinner was held on the day of the coronation for the patients, and the staff were all given one day off to go on a paid outing to Rothesay.
The First World War depleted the number of staff as many went off to fight, they were either replaced by inexperienced staff or were not replaced at all. The SDLA temporarily became a Naval War Hospital in 1918, with over 800 patients being moved to other asylums while the SDLA became a hospital. The patients of the SDLA were then returned in 1919 when its use as a temporary Naval War Hospital ended. Patients from the war were admitted to the SDLA well into the 1920s to deal with the trauma of what they had experienced.
In the 1930s, the Stirling District Mental Hospital Joint Committee took over the jurisdiction of Larbert and with it the SDLA. The implementation of electrical and hot baths treatment was put in place as was occupational therapy. The priority, however, was still to allow those that could work to lend a hand at the many farms of the SDLA.
1939–1959.
Dr Spence was the superintendent during the Second World War, during this time 55% of the staff were called up to go to war however Dr Spence was praised for operating the SDLA efficiently with the reduction of staff. The 1940s was when open wards and non-observation dormitories were introduced to the asylum. The asylum was transferred to the care of the NHS in 1948. Wooden huts were built alongside the Bellsdyke Road to allow for more patients and, these only began to be replaced in the 1960s.
1959–1997.
The Mental Health (Scotland) Act of 1960 saw the patient's being re-classified as informal, the admission rate fell and instead there was a large number of patient's voluntarily admitting themselves. The subject of mental health became less of a taboo subject and, the SDLA was re-classed as a hospital and, the name changed to Bellsdyke Hospital.
Nurse training increased as did the training of health visitors so that after-care treatment was improved. In April 1964, Cunningham House was opened, which was a new male psycho-neurotic block. Six new villas opened, Kinnaird and Stenhouse in 1967, Glenbervie, Dunmore, Carronhall and Torwood in 1968, they took over from the Succursal block as the villas allowed for a more personal treatment.
Although some services remained on site, the hospital effectively closed in 1997. Most of the buildings were demolished in the early 2000s.
"The Passing Hour".
"The Passing Hour" was a magazine and chronicle of the SDLA in Larbert, the first issue was published in January 1901, and the final issue was published in 1917. The magazine was published every two months with volumes containing poetry, correspondences, photographs of the SDLA patients and photographs from other asylums as well as short stories.

Cross-window

A cross-window is a window whose lights are defined by a mullion and a transom, forming a cross.
The Late Gothic cross-window is known since the 14th century and replaced the hitherto common Romanesque or Gothic arched window on buildings. Since then the latter have almost exclusively been reserved for church buildings. The two, upper lights were usually somewhat smaller that the two lower ones and could be opened separately. The latter is also true for a transom window, which has a horizontal bar or transom separating the lights.
Design.
Characteristically the rectangular window is divided into four individual lights by a mullion and transom in the form of a Latin cross. The window cross was original made of stone ('stone cross-window'); not until the Renaissance and Baroque periods did the timber cross-window emerge (e. g. on the abbey castle of Escorial and on other buildings in the Herrerian style). Where the transom is in the middle, the window is divided into four lights of equal size. Later the windows were often divided into six lights; the two upper ones often being joined and forming a type of fanlight.

Storming of the Venezuelan National Congress

The Storming of the Venezuelan National Congress, also known as Assault on the National Congress, was a brawl on January 24, 1848 at the headquarters of the Venezuelan Congress in Caracas that marked the definitive rupture between the Conservatives and Liberals, which had led almost two decades of continuous clashes.
Course of events.
At the beginning of 1848, the Congress was discussing the trial of the president José Tadeo Monagas for acts that violated the constitution. He was accused of having exercised extraordinary powers illegally, using armed force without the consent of the Governing Council, and having exercised the administration outside the capital. This resulted in a strong political dispute between the government of José Tadeo Monagas backed by the Liberal Party, and José Antonio Páez, supported by the Conservative Party. 
On January 24, 1848 the Minister of Internal Affairs and Justice, Martín Sanabria, moved to the seat of the Legislative Power to render the annual report of the Executive Power. While on the premises, the vice president of the Chamber of Deputies asked that he remains in the room. Outside of the Congress, rumor had it that Sanabria had been arrested or assassinated, which angered the liberal mobs that were on the street, who tried to enter but were repelled by the guard, initiating the confrontation. During the event, Santos Michelena was wounded by a bayonet, and succumbed to his injuries two months later on March 12. The parliamentarians Francisco Argote, José Antonio Salas and Juan García were also murdered by the mobs, as is the sergeant Pedro Pablo Azpúrua and a tailor involved in the brawl. The head of the guard of the legislative body, Guillermo Smith, was also wounded during the confrontation. Monagas, alerted of the events in course, comes on horseback accompanied by the general Santiago Mariño and his forces to restore order.
Aftermath.
After the events, the parliament took years to get back its autonomy. The Legislative Power and the Judicial Power lost their independence and were under direct control of the President of the Republic. The National Congress, which presumed the prosecution of the president at the start of the events dismissed him. Until that day, the National Congress had the majority of representatives of the conservative party, of many of them, out of fear, requested asylum, delegations, or fled to Curaçao 
Paez and the conservatives were ousted from power, which passed to the hands of Monagas and the Liberals, so the conservatives took the road of arms trying to regain power. Paez rose against Monagas few days after January 24; but he was defeated in the battle of Los Araguatos and had to take refuge in the republic of New Granada. In mid-1849 he landed in La Vela de Coro, and started another battle but he was defeated again by the government troops, commanded by José Laurencio Silva, who offered him capitulation, but Monagas refused to recognize the terms of the capitulation offered by Silva, and in consequence Páez was imprisoned, and eventually exiled.

Sophia Hull

Sophia, Lady Raffles, born Sophia Hull (5 May 1786 – 12 December 1858), was the second wife of Sir Stamford Raffles, who was a botanist and known as the founder of modern Singapore.
Early life.
Sophia Hull was born in Millman Street, London, England, the daughter of James Watson Hull and his wife Sophia (née Hollamby). She met Stamford Raffles in 1816 in Cheltenham, where she lived, and married him on 22 February 1817. She was aged thirty, her husband five years older.
Sophia, Lady Raffles.
Sir Stamford Raffles had previously been married in 1804 to Olivia Mariamne Devenish, a widow who was ten years older than him. Olivia had died in West Java, Indonesia, in 1814; his grief at her death was such that he erected a memorial to her which still stands at the Taman Prasasti Museum, a former cemetery, in Jakarta, Indonesia. There were no surviving children from this first marriage.
Married life.
Sophia had five children by Sir Stamford Raffles, two sons and three daughters:
Her first child Charlotte was born on board ship during the voyage to Sumatra, Indonesia, made by the couple soon after their marriage. All their children succumbed to tropical diseases, and were buried overseas, apart from Ella, who was sent back to Britain for the sake of her health.
In 1825, Sir Stamford and Lady Raffles also returned to Britain; the seaward journey took nearly a year, having lost many of their possessions in a fire on board East Indiaman ship "Fame", which they barely escaped with their lives; both were in poor health on board the ship "Mariner" by the time they arrived.
After her husband's death on 5 July 1826, Lady Raffles found she was in debt to the East India Company (EIC). She was nevertheless determined to write Sir Stamford's biography, which she did in the years that immediately followed, and the first edition of "Memoir of the life and public services of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, F.R.S. &amp;c.; particularly in the government of Java, 1811–1816; and of Bencoolen and its dependencies, 1817–1824; with details of the commerce and resources of the Eastern archipelago; and selections from his correspondence" was published in 1830 by John Murray III of the John Murray publishing house.
Her remaining child, daughter Ella Sophia, became engaged to marry John Sumner, the eldest son of Charles Richard Sumner, the Bishop of Winchester, and nephew of John Bird Sumner, the Bishop of Canterbury. Ella met John when her mother Sophia spent time recuperating from illness at the bishop's home in Winchester. She and Sophia were particularly interested when Sumner was ordained as a clergyman during their visit. Ella and John were due to marry in the summer of 1840, but Ella herself was then taken ill, initially with a broken blood vessel. Having deteriorated over several months, Ella died on 12 May 1840, to her mother's despair. She was 19 years old, and Sophia's last living link to Ella's father, the late Stamford Raffles. Sophia's friend and former neighbour, Bishop Samuel Wilberforce (the third son of William Wilberforce), described the funeral:
. . . the deep sobbing of Lady Raffles and John was most affecting. Then Lady Raffles had to be removed: and it was almost too much. She clung to the coffin and kissed its repulsive blackness: saying in a sort of thrilling whisper of agony "My child, my child, my babe. Must I leave thee?"
Death.
Lady Raffles continued to live on at Highwood House in Highwood Hill, Middlesex. She died in 1858, aged 72. Lady Raffles was buried in the graveyard of St Paul's Church, Mill Hill. Following her death, her husband's heir, his nephew Rev William Charles Raffles Flint, tried to sell the collection of Sir Stamford's possessions, known as the 'Raffles Collection', to the British Museum in London; they declined to purchase it. However, Raffles Flint eventually donated the Raffles Collection to the British Museum.

Big Whiteshell Lake

Big Whiteshell Lake is located within the Whiteshell Provincial Park in southeastern Manitoba, Canada. The lake is about east of Winnipeg at the terminus of Provincial Road 309.
The route from Rennie to Big Whiteshell Lake was originally constructed in the thirties, when workers from the Manitoba Home for Boys at Portage Le. Prairie attempted to cut a road through the Whiteshell Forest Reserve from Rennie to Green Lake. Further development of the lake and surrounding shoreline began in 1957, when the Manitoba Scout Association began looking for a larger campsite to accommodate their growing number of scouts. The provincial government offered a tract of land at the southern end of Big Whiteshell Lake, and Camp Alloway was established. The lake is a popular local tourist destination for fishing, hiking, and other summer activities. Manitoba entertainer Larry Clark, better known under his pseudonym Uncle Smokey, composed several novelty campfire songs while working in a fire lookout tower on Big Whiteshell Lake.

Zoe Laughlin

Zoe Laughlin () is a British artist, maker and materials engineer. She is the co-founder and Director of the Institute of Making at University College London. She is a regular panelist on the BBC Radio 4 show The Kitchen Cabinet. Laughlin was awarded the 2019 Trophy for Design Engineering from the Institution of Engineering Designers.
Education.
Laughlin took A-Levels in Art, Textiles and English Literature and completed a Masters of Art at Central Saint Martin's College of Art and Design. She earned a PhD in Material Science in the Department of Engineering at King's College London in 2010.
Research.
During her PhD, Laughlin discovered how materials affects the taste of food, and how to predict the taste of food using electrode potential. Her thesis, "Beyond the Swatch: How can the Science of Materials be Represented by the Materials Themselves in a Materials Library?", became the basis for the methodological approaches of the Institute of Making and some of its research. The experiments Laughlin undertook were designed to identify the links between the physical properties of materials and our aesthetic perception of materiality. As a result, she has been key to the development of the concept of Sensoaesthetics, which is the "application of scientific methodology to the aesthetic, sensual and emotional side" of materials.
Career.
In 2010/11, Mark Miodownik, Martin Conreen and Laughlin began working on the Institute of Making, which they planned to open in the east wing of Somerset House. In February 2012, they joined University College London, and launched "A Taste of Materials" in April 2012. She published "Material Matters: New Materials in Design" with Black Dog Publishing. Their Materials Library and Make Space opened in Malet Place on 14 March 2013.
Laughlin has created work and done projects with partners and galleries including Tate Modern, the Hayward Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Wellcome Collection. In 2016 her spoons became part of the new permanent collection of London's Design Museum and are on display in the Designer Maker User gallery.
Laughlin is interested in the sound of and taste of materials, as well as what she terms "the performativity of matter". She regularly speaks about materials and performs demonstration lectures. In 2012 she delivered a TEDx talk in Brussels on "The Performativity of Matter".
She is a trustee of the Crafts Council, and works with them to integrate new materials and making methods into the crafts sector. Laughlin was honoured by the Institution of Engineering Designers for her "outstanding contributions to design engineering".
Laughlin produces and hosts the podcast "The Things that Make Us". She appears regularly on British radio and television, and gives invited talks on material science in Britain and around the world. She has appeared on the Today Programme and "The Material Word" with Quentin Cooper. In 2016, Laughlin delivered an invited talk at The Royal Institution, "Performing Matter: Greatest Hits and New Findings".
Broadcasting.
This Morning.
Laughlin was the resident scientist on ITV's long running series This Morning, hosting the regular bi-weekly feature "Wonderstuff". On the show, Laughlin introduced Philip Scofield and Holly Willoughby to many marvellous materials and conducted numerous demonstrations including smelting copper and turning milk to plastic. In 2019 she returned to the show with a bang for a run of spectacular demonstrations including dripping a monster slime from the studio ceiling and ripping oxygen from hydrogen peroxide.
The Kitchen Cabinet.
Laughlin was asked on to BBC Radio 4's The Kitchen Cabinet as a guest in 2015 and has since become their resident materials expert. The May 2016 episode, from Sandwich, Kent, was recorded in Laughlin's old school hall.
Big Life Fix.
Laughlin was a maker on the BBC Two television programme, "Big Life Fix". In the show, a team of designers and inventors created solutions, often as simple as repurposing everyday objects, to change people's lives. On the show, Laughlin designed a number of items, including a lightweight, durable foam helmet for a child who suffers from hydrocephalus. Laughlin described the experience as "a great show to be part of". In Series 2, "Inventing the Impossible: Big Life Fix" Laughlin made a 'second skin' for a young man with Xeroderma Pigmentosum and a pair of robotic gloves that gave movement back to a man with paralysed hands.
Fireworks for a Tudor Queen.
In 2017 Laughlin and Lucy Worsley presented a 90-minute BBC Four programme exploring the history of fireworks, “Fizz Bang Wallop - A Tudor Firework Spectacular“. The show, “Fireworks for a Tudor Queen”, was broadcast in March 2018.
The Secret Life of Landfill.
In the spring of 2018 Laughlin and George McGavin made a BBC Four documentary "The Secret Life of Landfill: A Rubbish History", exploring the fate and future of rubbish deposited in landfill sites.
The Secret Story of Stuff.
In summer 2018 Laughlin wrote and presented her own show for BBC Four entitled "The Secret Story of Stuff: Materials for the Modern Age", blending "bonhomie, excitement and expertise in perfect proportions". In the programme she performed a number of demonstrations to reveal the wonderous properties of materials, including a test of the thermally insulative equalities of mycelium using a high-powered blow touch and ice-cream. The show was first broadcast in the autumn of 2018 and has subsequently been repeated.
Plane Spotting Live.
Over the course of 3 consecutive nights in June 2019, Laughlin co-presented "Plane Spotting Live" for BBC Four with Peter Snow and Andi Peters. The programme was broadcast live from a set constructed on East Midlands Aeropark, alongside the runway of East Midlands Airport.
How to Make.
In "How to Make" Laughlin deconstructs everyday items - training shoes, a toothbrush, and a pair of headphones - examining the materials they're made of and re-making a customised version of each. This BBC Four series first aired on 2 April 2020 and was produced in connection with the Open University.

2018 Sheffield City Region mayoral election

The inaugural Sheffield City Region mayoral election was held on 3 May 2018 to elect the mayor of the Sheffield City Region. The mayor will lead the Sheffield City Region Combined Authority. Voting is restricted to the four councils which are constituent members of the combined authority: Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield. Together these councils make up South Yorkshire.
As the election took place using the supplementary vote system, electors were able to vote for a "first preference" candidate and a "second preference" candidate. The leading candidate needed to achieve over 50% of the first preference votes in order to be elected in the first round. As the leading candidate, Dan Jarvis, received 47.1% of the total number of votes in the first round, the election proceeded to the second round and voters second preferences were distributed between the two leading candidates. Dan Jarvis, the Labour and Co-operative candidate, was subsequently elected in the second round with a total number of 144,154 votes.
Subsequent elections will be held in May 2022 and every four years after.
Electoral system.
The election used a supplementary vote system, in which voters express a first and second preference of candidates.
This means that the winning candidate has the support of a majority of voters who expressed a preference among the top two.
All registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) living in the combined authority area aged 18 or over on 3 May 2018 were entitled to vote in the mayoral election.

SS Henry Phipps

The Henry Phipps was a American Great Lakes freighter that served on the Great Lakes of North America from her launching in 1907 to her scrapping in 1976 by Hyman Michaels Company of Duluth, Minnesota. The "Phipps" was used to haul bulk cargoes such as iron ore, coal, grain and occasionally limestone.
History.
The "Henry Phipps" (official number 204136) was a product of the West Bay City Shipbuilding Company (F.W. Wheeler Shipyards) of West Bay City, Michigan. She was commissioned by the Pittsburgh Steamship Company (a subsidiary of United States Steel Corporation) of Cleveland, Ohio. She was launched on May 11, 1907 as hull number #623. She had a length of 601-feet, a beam of 58-feet and a height of 32-feet. She had a gross tonnage of 7,676 tons and a net tonnage of 6,426 tons. She was powered by a 2,000 horsepower triple expansion steam engine and fueled by two Scotch marine boilers. She entered service on June 24, 1907. In July 1907 the "Phipps" ran aground off Pyramid Point on Lake Michigan.
On August 13, 1909, the "Phipps" "sideswiped" another 600-foot long laker, the "Daniel J. Morrell" in heavy fog in Whitefish Bay. Both vessels sustained severe damage. The cost to repair the damage done to the "Phipps" was around $5,000, while the cost to repair the damage done to the "Morrell" was around $10,000.
On September 22, 1911 the "Phipps" rammed and sank the steel-hulled freighter "Joliet" off Port Huron, Michigan in the St. Clair River. The "Joliet" was anchored at the time of the collision. The crew of the "Phipps" couldn't see the "Joliet" because their vision was impaired by dense fog. The "Joliet" sank almost directly over the railway tunnel between Sarnia, Ontario and Port Huron.
In 1942 she was lengthened to 608 feet in length, and re registered to Fairport, Ohio. In 1946 the "Phipps" was rebuilt with a gross register tonnage of 7,703 tons and a net register tonnage of 6,453 tons. In 1949 the fleet owned by the Pittsburgh Steamship Company was reincorporated in Wilmington, Delaware. In 1951 the "Phipps" was transferred to the United States Steel Corporation of Cleveland, Ohio and re registered to New York. In 1967 the fleet was renamed United States Steel Great Lakes Fleet.
The scrapping of the Phipps.
In late July 1976 the "Phipps" was taken to a scrapping berth in Duluth, Minnesota, for scrapping by the Hyman Michaels Company. They started scrapping her in November 1976. Her enrollment was surrendered in August 1977.

Boris Dorozhenko

Boris Dorozhenko is a Ukrainian-born hockey coach. He played professional hockey in the former USSR, before becoming the director of the Mexico Ice Hockey Federation, where he helped develop that country's national hockey program. He then founded the Next Generation Hockey school, which relocated to Scottsdale, Arizona. There he has trained young hockey players, including Auston Matthews.
Early life.
Boris Dorozhenko was born in Kyiv, in what is now Ukraine, during Soviet rule, and began playing hockey at nine years old. He has a degree in Mathematics from the University of Kyiv and played professional hockey in Russia until retiring in 1994.
Coaching.
Following his playing career Dorozhenko relocated to Mexico during the collapse of the USSR, and once there he was placed in charge of developing a national hockey program through the Mexican Hockey Federation. As the program's director, he developed the program from the ground up, beginning with the development of peewee age hockey programs in Mexico City.
Dorozhenko then moved his hockey school, Next Generation Hockey, to Scottsdale, Arizona in 2005. The move was precipitated by a training camp he held in Phoenix the prior year, where he met the future NHLer Auston Matthews, who was age seven at the time. It was Matthews’ parents that suggested to Dorozhenko that he move to Arizona full-time—where he lived with the Matthews family for his first two years in the US. Dorozhenko acted as a coach to Matthews throughout his youth hockey career, and was referred to affectionately as "Uncle Boris" by the young player. He also received initial support from former NHL players Claude Lemieux and Russ Courtnall, whose sons trained under Dorozhenko.
At Next Generation Hockey, Dorozhenko runs month long camps focusing on skating and drills, and he also travels to international hockey camps to provide skating drills. These drills focus on “edge control”, so that players develop a natural ability to maneuver better while under duress. In his program, Dorozhenko places skating skills ahead of puck control skills in a player's development.

Elizaveta Nikolayevna Goreva (, née Voronina, 1859—18 July 1917) was a Russian theatre actress and entrepreneur.
Biography.
Born in Poltava, Ukraine (then part of Russian Empire) to the head of the city police department, she lost both her parents early in life, and was raised by a relative, Nikolal Miloslavsky, a well known actor of his time who gave her first drama lessons. Under his guidance she debuted on stage the Odessa Theatre, then moved to Kharkiv, and later Saratov and Rostov-on-Don. In the 1878-1879 season she worked in Taganrog, the next year returned to Odessa and in 1880 found herself in Vilno where she succeeded the recently deceased prima A.N. Melnikova-Samoilova as Mary, Queen of Scots in Friedrich Schiller's "Mary Stuart", to much public and critical acclaim.
In winter 1881-1882 Goreva worked with the Tiflis theatre, then in the spring found herself in St Petersburg's Alexandrinka and had success as Maryitsa in Dmitry Averkiyev's "Kashirskaya Starina" (Old Times in Kashira). Having failed to secure a long-term engagement, she traveled to Irkutsk. Here, after having divorced the Maly Theatre actor Fyodor Gorev (whom she married in her youth), she spent two years with the city theatre and was celebrated as a star, after the huge success she had as Medea in the eponymous tragedy by Alexey Suvorin and Viktor Burenin.
After two unsuccessful attempts to sign a long-term contract with Alexandrinka, Goreva spent some time in Europe (where she played with numerous troupes, notably in Berlin, Leipzig and Prague). In 1889 she founded her own theatre in Moscow, originally with Pyotr Boborykin as a director. Among the actors engaged in the troupe were Nikolai Sinelnikov, Leonid Sobinov (who made his debut here on 15 January 1891), Mamont Dalsky, Marius Petipa Jr., Nikolai Roshchin-Insarov and, occasionally, her former husband Fyodor Gorev. The Goreva Theatre lasted for just two years, folded for financial reasons but left a strong mark upon the city's cultural life and received good press. She went on to perform in the Russian province, and in 1904 as part of the Paver Orlenev troupe visited several European cities.
According to the Russian Theatre Encyclopedia, "Goreva had classic good looks, beautiful voice and great scenic temperament, slightly marred by the penchant for excessive pathos."

The Painted Bird (film)

The Painted Bird () is a 2019 internationally co-produced black and white war drama film written, directed and produced by Václav Marhoul. It is an adaptation of Jerzy Kosiński's novel of the same name. It is the first film to feature the Interslavic language; Marhoul stated that he decided to use Interslavic so that no Slavic nation would nationally identify with the story.
"The Painted Bird" was selected to play in competition at the 76th Venice International Film Festival and was chosen for 2019 Toronto International Film Festival as part of Special Presentations. The film also screened in the Dare strand at the 63rd BFI London Film Festival. It was selected as the Czech entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 92nd Academy Awards making the December shortlist. Its brutal scenes led to walkouts from audiences at the Venice, Toronto and London film festivals. At the 35th Warsaw International Film Festival, the audience honored the film with a long ovation after its only screening.
Plot.
In an unidentified area of war-torn Eastern Europe, a young boy lives with his elderly aunt. Startled at her death, the boy accidentally sets the house ablaze and leaves. His further adventures are a series of horrific encounters with ignorance, exploitation, and depravity. In the first village he reaches, an old healer buys him, but he is later blamed for bad luck and thrown in a river. He is next taken in by a miller and his wife. After the miller gouges out the eyes of a younger man seen exchanging glances with his wife, the boy runs off. He meets Lekh, a bird breeder who treats him well. Lekh has sex with a wild woman whom local village women brutally rape, after which Lekh hangs himself. The boy leaves.
The boy finds a tame horse with a broken leg and takes it to the next village, where a villager kills it. Local red army cossacks force the villagers to deliver him to the Germans, identifying him as a Jew. The German soldier tasked with executing the boy releases him. Later caught by SS guards who bring him to a local town, he is saved from execution. A local priest takes him in, but then arranges for him to lodge with a local man named Garbos, who proves to be a pedophile. The boy causes Garbos's gruesome death. After the well-meaning priest dies, his replacement has no use for the boy, and he is run out of the town.
The boy is then taken in by Labina. When her elderly father dies, she coaxes the boy into performing sexual acts on her, beating him when he fails to perform and mocking his inadequacy by simulating sex with a goat. He later retaliates by killing the goat and tossing its head through Labina's window before running away.
The boy comes into contact with the Red Army again. One of the Soviet officers, a sniper named Mitka, decides to take care of him temporarily. The boy watches Mitka kill several locals in reprisal for an attack on Russian soldiers. As the Russians decamp, they send the boy to an orphanage, where he is a loner and repeatedly tries to escape. He is beaten by a local anti-Semitic shopkeeper, whom he kills in revenge. A man named Nikodém comes to the orphanage, greets the boy tearfully as his son, and takes him home. The boy refuses to speak. Nikodém tries to explain why they sent him to his aunt and the boy protests angrily. He asks if he at least remembers his name, but the boy does not respond. Traveling by bus toward home, Nikodém falls asleep. His son notices a number tattooed on his father's arm and with his finger writes his name, Joska, on the bus window.
Production.
Václav Marhoul announced his intention to adapt Jerzy Kosiński's "The Painted Bird" in September 2012 when he secured rights for the story. Marhoul stated that the film will have budget approximately 120 million CZK. His plan was to secure finances during next 2 years. The film received financial support of 15 million CZK from the Czech Film Fund in 2016.
The film entered production in 2017. Marhoul decided to shoot the film in seven phases. First phase finished on 7 May 2017. Filmmakers were filming around Ukrainian village Svalovych from 23 March 2017 to 12 April 2017. Some reshoots had to be made from 21 to 23 April 2017 in Brdy Military area. Second phase started in South Slovakia on 5 June 2017 to 5 July 2017. Film crew was shooting around Váh river, at Mlynská Dolina and in Malý Dunajec.
Shooting moved to Lipno Dam and Kvilda in February and March 2018. Crew had to deal with bad weather as they needed ice on the lake. Shooting concluded in July 2018 after 100 shooting days during 16 months. The film then entered post production. Post production concluded in February 2019.
For the villagers' dialogue, Marhoul decided to use the Interslavic language instead of any ethnic Slavic language:

Critical response.
"The Painted Bird" has received very positive reviews from critics with many likening it to films by Andrei Tarkovsky. It holds an approval rating of 81% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 99 reviews, with an average rating of 7.50/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "Brutally uncompromising in its portrayal of Nazi Germany, "The Painted Bird" is a difficult watch that justifies its dark horror with searing impact." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
The film was projected for journalists on 2 September 2019. Some people left the theatre as they could not stand the depicted violence and rape scenes. The Daily Mail described it as "a panoply of depravity.” Overall reception was positive as the film received a long ovation from the audience and some unofficial responses called it one of the front-runners for Golden Lion, but ultimately lost to "Joker". Director Marhoul was particularly praised. The film also received a 10-minute standing ovation during its premiere on 3 September 2019.
Xan Brooks of the "Guardian" gave the film five stars, calling it a "savage, searing three-hour tour of hell" and "phantasmagorical horror, rattling around ravaged eastern Europe for just shy of three hours." He praised the film's visuals and atmosphere. Guy Lodge of "Variety" was also positive, noting camerawork by Vladimír Smutný. He called the film "muscular, savagely realized Jerzy Kosiński adaptation puts an unnamed Jewish boy through a challenging litany of Holocaust horrors."
In a more negative review, A.A. Dowd of the "A.V. Club" praised the film's cinematography while criticizing its bleak tone, saying ""The Painted Bird" is, in the end, the kind of slog that treats shopworn insights about the brutality of man as justification for drowning us in the evidence."

19th century in science

The 19th century in science saw the birth of science as a profession; the term scientist was coined in 1833 by William Whewell, which soon replaced the older term of (natural) philosopher.
Among the most influential ideas of the 19th century were those of Charles Darwin (alongside the independent researches of Alfred Russel Wallace), who in 1859 published the book "The Origin of Species", which introduced the idea of evolution by natural selection. Another important landmark in medicine and biology were the successful efforts to prove the germ theory of disease. Following this, Louis Pasteur made the first vaccine against rabies, and also made many discoveries in the field of chemistry, including the asymmetry of crystals. In chemistry, Dmitri Mendeleev, following the atomic theory of John Dalton, created the first periodic table of elements. In physics, the experiments, theories and discoveries of Michael Faraday, Andre-Marie Ampere, James Clerk Maxwell, and their contemporaries led to the creation of electromagnetism as a new branch of science. Thermodynamics led to an understanding of heat and the notion of energy was defined.
Other highlights include the discoveries unveiling the nature of atomic structure and matter, simultaneously with chemistry – and of new kinds of radiation. In astronomy, the planet Neptune was discovered. In mathematics, the notion of complex numbers finally matured and led to a subsequent analytical theory; they also began the use of hypercomplex numbers. Karl Weierstrass and others carried out the arithmetization of analysis for functions of real and complex variables. It also saw rise to new progress in geometry beyond those classical theories of Euclid, after a period of nearly two thousand years. The mathematical science of logic likewise had revolutionary breakthroughs after a similarly long period of stagnation. But the most important step in science at this time were the ideas formulated by the creators of electrical science. Their work changed the face of physics and made possible for new technology to come about such as electric power, electrical telegraphy, the telephone, and radio.
Mathematics.
Throughout the 19th century mathematics became increasingly abstract. Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) epitomizes this trend. He did revolutionary work on functions of complex variables, in geometry, and on the convergence of series, leaving aside his many contributions to science. He also gave the first satisfactory proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra and of the quadratic reciprocity law. His 1801 volume "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae" laid the foundations of modern number theory.
This century saw the development of the two forms of non-Euclidean geometry, where the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry no longer holds.
The Russian mathematician Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky and his rival, the Hungarian mathematician János Bolyai, independently defined and studied hyperbolic geometry, where uniqueness of parallels no longer holds. In this geometry the sum of angles in a triangle add up to less than 180°. Elliptic geometry was developed later in the 19th century by the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann; here no parallel can be found and the angles in a triangle add up to more than 180°. Riemann also developed Riemannian geometry, which unifies and vastly generalizes the three types of geometry.
The 19th century saw the beginning of a great deal of abstract algebra. Hermann Grassmann in Germany gave a first version of vector spaces, William Rowan Hamilton in Ireland developed noncommutative algebra. The British mathematician George Boole devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called Boolean algebra, in which the only numbers were 0 and 1. Boolean algebra is the starting point of mathematical logic and has important applications in computer science.
Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Bernhard Riemann, and Karl Weierstrass reformulated the calculus in a more rigorous fashion.
Also, for the first time, the limits of mathematics were explored. Niels Henrik Abel, a Norwegian, and Évariste Galois, a Frenchman, proved that there is no general algebraic method for solving polynomial equations of degree greater than four (Abel–Ruffini theorem). Other 19th-century mathematicians utilized this in their proofs that straightedge and compass alone are not sufficient to trisect an arbitrary angle, to construct the side of a cube twice the volume of a given cube, nor to construct a square equal in area to a given circle. Mathematicians had vainly attempted to solve all of these problems since the time of the ancient Greeks. On the other hand, the limitation of three dimensions in geometry was surpassed in the 19th century through considerations of parameter space and hypercomplex numbers.
In the later 19th century, Georg Cantor established the first foundations of set theory, which enabled the rigorous treatment of the notion of infinity and has become the common language of nearly all mathematics. Cantor's set theory, and the rise of mathematical logic in the hands of Peano, L. E. J. Brouwer, David Hilbert, Bertrand Russell, and A.N. Whitehead, initiated a long running debate on the foundations of mathematics.
The 19th century saw the founding of a number of national mathematical societies: the London Mathematical Society in 1865, the Société Mathématique de France in 1872, the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in 1883, the Circolo Matematico di Palermo in 1884, and the American Mathematical Society in 1888. The first international, special-interest society, the Quaternion Society, was formed in 1899, in the context of a vector controversy.
Physics.
In 1800, Alessandro Volta invented the electric battery (known of the voltaic pile) and thus improved the way electric currents could also be studied. A year later, Thomas Young demonstrated the wave nature of light—which received strong experimental support from the work of Augustin-Jean Fresnel—and the principle of interference. In 1813, Peter Ewart supported the idea of the conservation of energy in his paper "On the measure of moving force". In 1820, Hans Christian Ørsted found that a current-carrying conductor gives rise to a magnetic force surrounding it, and within a week after Ørsted's discovery reached France, André-Marie Ampère discovered that two parallel electric currents will exert forces on each other. In 1821, William Hamilton began his analysis of Hamilton's characteristic function. In 1821, Michael Faraday built an electricity-powered motor, while Georg Ohm stated his law of electrical resistance in 1826, expressing the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electric circuit. A year later, botanist Robert Brown discovered Brownian motion: pollen grains in water undergoing movement resulting from their bombardment by the fast-moving atoms or molecules in the liquid. In 1829, Gaspard Coriolis introduced the terms of work (force times distance) and kinetic energy with the meanings they have today.
In 1831, Faraday (and independently Joseph Henry) discovered the reverse effect, the production of an electric potential or current through magnetism – known as electromagnetic induction; these two discoveries are the basis of the electric motor and the electric generator, respectively. In 1834, Carl Jacobi discovered his uniformly rotating self-gravitating ellipsoids (the Jacobi ellipsoid). In 1834, John Russell observed a nondecaying solitary water wave (soliton) in the Union Canal near Edinburgh and used a water tank to study the dependence of solitary water wave velocities on wave amplitude and water depth. In 1835, William Hamilton stated Hamilton's canonical equations of motion. In the same year, Gaspard Coriolis examined theoretically the mechanical efficiency of waterwheels, and deduced the Coriolis effect. In 1841, Julius Robert von Mayer, an amateur scientist, wrote a paper on the conservation of energy but his lack of academic training led to its rejection. In 1842, Christian Doppler proposed the Doppler effect. In 1847, Hermann von Helmholtz formally stated the law of conservation of energy. In 1851, Léon Foucault showed the Earth's rotation with a huge pendulum (Foucault pendulum).
There were important advances in continuum mechanics in the first half of the century, namely formulation of laws of elasticity for solids and discovery of Navier–Stokes equations for fluids.
Laws of thermodynamics.
In the 19th century, the connection between heat and mechanical energy was established quantitatively by Julius Robert von Mayer and James Prescott Joule, who measured the mechanical equivalent of heat in the 1840s. In 1849, Joule published results from his series of experiments (including the paddlewheel experiment) which show that heat is a form of energy, a fact that was accepted in the 1850s. The relation between heat and energy was important for the development of steam engines, and in 1824 the experimental and theoretical work of Sadi Carnot was published. Carnot captured some of the ideas of thermodynamics in his discussion of the efficiency of an idealized engine. Sadi Carnot's work provided a basis for the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics—a restatement of the law of conservation of energy—which was stated around 1850 by William Thomson, later known as Lord Kelvin, and Rudolf Clausius. Lord Kelvin, who had extended the concept of absolute zero from gases to all substances in 1848, drew upon the engineering theory of Lazare Carnot, Sadi Carnot, and Émile Clapeyron–as well as the experimentation of James Prescott Joule on the interchangeability of mechanical, chemical, thermal, and electrical forms of work—to formulate the first law.
Kelvin and Clausius also stated the second law of thermodynamics, which was originally formulated in terms of the fact that heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter. Other formulations followed quickly (for example, the second law was expounded in Thomson and Peter Guthrie Tait's influential work "Treatise on Natural Philosophy") and Kelvin in particular understood some of the law's general implications. The second Law was the idea that gases consist of molecules in motion had been discussed in some detail by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738, but had fallen out of favor, and was revived by Clausius in 1857. In 1850, Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault measured the speed of light in water and find that it is slower than in air, in support of the wave model of light. In 1852, Joule and Thomson demonstrated that a rapidly expanding gas cools, later named the Joule–Thomson effect or Joule–Kelvin effect. Hermann von Helmholtz puts forward the idea of the heat death of the universe in 1854, the same year that Clausius established the importance of "dQ/T" (Clausius's theorem) (though he did not yet name the quantity).
James Clerk Maxwell.
In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell discovered the distribution law of molecular velocities. Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields are propagated outward from their source at a speed equal to that of light and that light is one of several kinds of electromagnetic radiation, differing only in frequency and wavelength from the others. In 1859, Maxwell worked out the mathematics of the distribution of velocities of the molecules of a gas. The wave theory of light was widely accepted by the time of Maxwell's work on the electromagnetic field, and afterward the study of light and that of electricity and magnetism were closely related. In 1864 James Maxwell published his papers on a dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field, and stated that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon in the 1873 publication of Maxwell's "Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism". This work drew upon theoretical work by German theoreticians such as Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber. The encapsulation of heat in particulate motion, and the addition of electromagnetic forces to Newtonian dynamics established an enormously robust theoretical underpinning to physical observations.
The prediction that light represented a transmission of energy in wave form through a "luminiferous ether", and the seeming confirmation of that prediction with Helmholtz student Heinrich Hertz's 1888 detection of electromagnetic radiation, was a major triumph for physical theory and raised the possibility that even more fundamental theories based on the field could soon be developed. Experimental confirmation of Maxwell's theory was provided by Hertz, who generated and detected electric waves in 1886 and verified their properties, at the same time foreshadowing their application in radio, television, and other devices. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered the photoelectric effect. Research on the electromagnetic waves began soon after, with many scientists and inventors conducting experiments on their properties. In the mid to late 1890s Guglielmo Marconi developed a radio wave based wireless telegraphy system (see invention of radio).
The atomic theory of matter had been proposed again in the early 19th century by the chemist John Dalton and became one of the hypotheses of the kinetic-molecular theory of gases developed by Clausius and James Clerk Maxwell to explain the laws of thermodynamics. The kinetic theory in turn led to the statistical mechanics of Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906) and Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839–1903), which held that energy (including heat) was a measure of the speed of particles. Interrelating the statistical likelihood of certain states of organization of these particles with the energy of those states, Clausius reinterpreted the dissipation of energy to be the statistical tendency of molecular configurations to pass toward increasingly likely, increasingly disorganized states (coining the term "entropy" to describe the disorganization of a state). The statistical versus absolute interpretations of the second law of thermodynamics set up a dispute that would last for several decades (producing arguments such as "Maxwell's demon"), and that would not be held to be definitively resolved until the behavior of atoms was firmly established in the early 20th century. In 1902, James Jeans found the length scale required for gravitational perturbations to grow in a static nearly homogeneous medium.
Chemistry.
In chemistry, Dmitri Mendeleev, following the atomic theory of John Dalton, created the first periodic table of elements.
Biology and medicine.
In 1859, Charles Darwin published the book "The Origin of Species", which introduced the idea of evolution by natural selection.&lt;br&gt;
Oscar Hertwig publishes his findings in reproductive and developmental biology. In 1875 he published his first work, being the first to correctly describe animal conception. In his work later work in 1885, he described that the nucleus contained nuclein (now called nucleic acid) and that these nuclein were responsible for the transmission of hereditary characteristics.

Slavsko Polje

Slavsko Polje () is a village in central Croatia, in the municipality of Gvozd, Sisak-Moslavina County. It is connected by the D6 highway.
History.
In the late 17th century, the village became a part of the Military Frontier. In the 18th century, it belonged to the Glina regiment. The development of the Vrginmost-Karlovac railway line in 1905 was important for the development of the village as it both provided employment (i.e. railway maintenance work) and allowed residents to seek employment and engage in trade further afield. In 1918, the village became a part of the Serbian-Croatian-Slovenian Kingdom and later on, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.
The village suffered heavy demographic losses in the World War II with 417 of its residents perishing. Of those, 235 were civilian victims of fascism while 81 died as partisan resistance fighters, and others succumbed to typhoid. In Glina massacres alone, 136 men and boys lost their lives in early August 1941. The first residents losing their lives already in May 1941 perished in the Jadovno concentration camp while some of its captured partisans died as prisoners of war in far away Norway. After being heavily hit by brutal Ustaše campaign in summer 1941, the population joined the antifascist resistance movement "en masse".
Demographics.
According to the 2011 census, the village of Slavsko Polje has 338 inhabitants. This represents 44.95% of its pre-war population according to the 1991 census.

Starring Aneta Piotrowska, Emma Friedman-Cohen, Daniel Barry, Andy Abbot, Darren Rose, and Max Davis, it premiered in competition at the 2018 International Film Festival Rotterdam.
Plot.
Katie, a young American documentarian, sets out to make a film about immigrants in post-Brexit-vote London, but ends up intruding on the life of Alicja, a struggling Polish actress. With confrontational questions, she tries to force intimacy and drives a wedge between Alicja and her boyfriend Michael. Alicja earns a pittance as an assistant in a cinema and is trying to get work as an actress while she becomes engrossed in the film. This documentary soon becomes the report of a questionable game in which the two women challenge each other.
Release.
The film had a cinema release in the UK on July 19, 2019 by Republic Distribution and later on November 29, 2019 in the USA by Subliminal Films.
Reception.
"My friend the Polish Girl" holds a 69% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 13 critic's reviews with an average rating of 5.67/10.
Jeannette Catsoulis for The New York Times wrote, “Shot mostly in black and white and with an improvisational feel, ‘My Friend the Polish Girl’ is cool and clever, feigning social realism with winking calculation.” While Guy Lodge of Variety: “From its cramped, off-the-cuff shooting style (mostly in washed-out monochrome) to its persuasive ensemble, ‘My Friend the Polish Girl’ mostly pulls off the documentary pretense with wily skill.” Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian nominated the lead Aneta Piotrowska as one of the top female performances of 2019.
Awards.
Nominated for Best British Feature Film at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2018. "My Friend the Polish Girl" won the Grand Prix at Mlodzi &amp; Film Debut festival in 2019.

<doc id="56661424" url="?curid=56661424" title="Erase Me (album)">
Erase Me (album)

Erase Me is the eighth studio album by American rock band Underoath. It is their first album in eight years following "Ø (Disambiguation)" (2010), marking the longest gap between two studio albums in the band's career, and their first one with founding drummer and clean vocalist Aaron Gillespie since "Lost in the Sound of Separation" (2008). It was recorded in mid-2017 with Matt Squire and mixed by Ken Andrews. The album was released via Fearless Records on April 6, 2018.
Background.
Upon announcing the album, the band updated their Spotify biography to read: "The band who once openly—and without apology—professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, "Erase Me" illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems."
Drummer Gillespie said of the album, "We've had success and we've come through a lot of waters. There's been 11,000 things we've been through so you would think, almost rhetorically, 'What do you need now?' All of us are finally in that place in our lives where the only thing we care about is inclusion for everybody—for the world. For me, exclusion is the scariest thing in the world. And I think Underoath coming back now with a new record—which none of us thought was possible—we want people to know that this is your music and you can feel however the fuck you want about it. I just want to prove that we are doing everything in the most honest way we ever have. This is the healthiest we've ever been as a group of people, as musicians, and in our worldview."
Critical reception.
The album received positive reviews upon release with some publications praising the chemistry between screamer Spencer Chamberlain and singer Aaron Gillespie as well as Christopher Dudley's programming while many fans criticized the band for going in a more alternative rock direction in contrast to their metalcore back catalog.
New Noise gave the album a mostly positive review stating "The whole album is a throwback to when albums flowed together purposefully – much like how Define the Great Line embraced the push and pull of inter-album dynamics. Erase Me is a full-album experience that feels like a bridge between Underoath's previous four records and vocalist Spencer Chamberlain's electronic rock project Sleepwave. Christopher Dudley's synth-work and programming, along with pulsing bass-lines from Grant Brandell result in the most industrialized version of the band yet. However, the stars of the show are Chamberlain and drummer Aaron Gillespie, whose kit work is as impressive as ever ('On My Teeth' will make fans smile). Their vocal trade-offs skew fairly heavily toward Chamberlain's dexterous pipes, which makes sense in keeping with the darker sound. It doesn't always work, most notably in sections of 'Rapture' and 'I Give Up' that feel a bit out of sorts" Metal Injection wrote of the album that "'Rapture' might not be an immediate hit with Underoath fans, and there are a couple of other tracks with the same flavor as such, ('Wake Me'), but there are plenty of other tracks to chew on. 'On My Teeth' is a great mix of their hectic side while still being able to bring it down with a clean and melodic chorus. 'Hold Your Breath' will also persuade you to circle a pit as soon as it drops. And at the same time, a song like 'ihateit' has also been stuck in my head for several days now. Again, an album like this could have been released immediately after Ø and it wouldn't have appeared to have been a departure." MetalSucks gave the album 2 out of 5 stars and explained "It's not a boring listen per se, but it's not fresh. A significant portion of the material here feels like something bands like Bring Me the Horizon and Norma Jean beat into the ground circa in the late '00s and early '10s. While I'm sure some fans will be content with that, if you're anything like me you'll find yourself wondering whether or not any of this was worth your time." Sputnik Music gave the album 3 out of 5 further elaborating "Unintentionally or otherwise, Spencer's Music Feeds interview divided the band's creatives into himself and Aaron, the pop songwriters, while Tim and Chris bring the heavy and experimental material. It's probably not that black-and-white in reality, but it's an easy narrative I think many will adopt in Erase Me's wake, looking for ways to shift and pinpoint the blame on why the album is a relative disappointment."

At around 5:00 p.m. a minivan rigged with explosives detonated near the embassy compound. The explosion was followed by three armed militants attempting to storm the compound on foot, but they were repelled and killed by Turkish and Somali security guards.
Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement. saying “Mujahideen forces in Mogadishu have just carried out an operation targeting a group of Turkish diplomats in Hodan district.” The U.S. State Department labeled the attack a "cowardly act" while the United Nations Security Council released a statement condemning it in "strongest terms."

Amenomania

Amenomania (compound of Latin "amoenus", "cheerful"; and Greek μανία, "madness") is a disused psychiatric diagnosis that originally designated patients with delusional disorders which do not paralyse them, but who may have fixed bizarre delusions. In some cases, religious delusion might accompany, causing individuals to believe to have peculiar spiritual powers, or even being God, often characterising outlines which might be diagnosed by modern psychiatry as paranoid schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.
According to Benjamin Rush, amenomania would be a higher form of hypochondriasis, in which the patient, instead of having anxiety upon non-existent diseases, would deny any imperfection in his health, being not melancholic about his mental abnormalities, but rather cheerful (hence the name of the condition).

<doc id="56661464" url="?curid=56661464" title="Pyramid Club (Philadelphia)">
Pyramid Club (Philadelphia)

The Pyramid Club was formed in November 1937 by African-American professionals for the "cultural, civic and social advancement of Negroes in Philadelphia."
By the 1950s, it was "Philadelphia's leading African-American social club."
Between 1940 and 1957, the club's building at 1517 Girard Avenue, Philadelphia, PA, was a center for social and cultural life.
Because African-Americans were barred from many clubs and restaurants, the Pyramid Club had its own bar and restaurant. It hosted parties, social events, concerts by noted musicians such as Marian Anderson and Duke Ellington, speakers including Martin Luther King Jr. and J. Robert Oppenheimer, and an annual art exhibition (1941-1957) featuring both local and national artists.
The Pyramid Club was the only exhibition space in Philadelphia at the time that was owned, operated and controlled by African-Americans. The club played an important role within the African-American community by connecting artists with middle and upper-class professionals able to support their work.
The Pyramid Club dissolved in 1963.
It has been commemorated with a historical marker by the Pennsylvania Historical &amp; Museum Commission.
Founding.
Among those instrumental in establishing the Pyramid Club were Woodley Wells, Alton C. Berry, George Drummond, Wilbur Strickland, Lewis Tanner Moore, Scholley Pace Alexander, Theodore O. Spaulding, Thomas Powell, and Walter Fitzgerald Jerrick. Dr. Walter Fitzgerald Jerrick became president of the club. Its directors included Drs. Harry J. Greene and Charles W. Dorsey and attorney Theodore O. Spaulding.
Membership.
According to "The Crisis", all members of the Pyramid Club had to be members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). 
Membership in the club cost $120, with monthly dues of $2.40.
At least at first, only men were officially accepted as members in the Pyramid Club. Women, however, were active at an organizational level throughout the club's history. There was an active Ladies’ Auxiliary, a Pyramid Wives Club, and a Women’s Coordinating Committee. Women could sit on the exhibition committee, whose work included the selection of pieces for exhibitions. Works by women were accepted and shown in exhibitions.
Art exhibitions.
Between 1941 and 1957, the Pyramid Club held an annual art exhibition which has been described as "one of the pre-eminent black art exhibits in the country".
The exhibitions were managed by Humbert Lincoln Howard.
Members of the Pyramid Club worked closely with the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA), with benefits to both communities. Although the express goal of the club was to increase opportunities for African-Americans, exhibitions at the Pyramid Club included supportive white artists as well as African-American artists. 
The club's art director, Humbert Howard, was widely connected in the art world and preferred to follow an integrationist policy in his selection of works for the club's shows. He believed that choosing works by both white and black artists, based on merit, would expand the show's patronage and ultimately benefit black artists. His strategy was not always popular: in 1949 Howard and an anonymous critic in the "Philadelphia Afro-American" debated the inclusion of white artists whose works were shown in discriminatory galleries.
Artist Julius Bloch refused to show his work at the Philadelphia Sketch Club when it would not include black artists, choosing to show his works at the Pyramid Club instead.
Artists whose works appeared at the Pyramid Club included Morris Atkinson Blackburn, Julius Thiengen Bloch, Samuel Joseph Brown, Jr., Claude Clark, 
Beauford Delaney,
Joseph Delaney, Allan Randall Freelon, Rex Goreleigh, 
Humbert Howard, 
Paul F. Keene Jr., Ralph Taylor (1896-1978), and Dox Thrash.
Although women were not accepted as members, their works were shown in the exhibitions. The exhibition “Fifty Seven Artists,” held February 20-March 20, 1948 at the Pyramid Club, was dedicated to Laura Wheeler Waring (1887-1948) who had just died. Eleven women artists were listed in the program, which included Selma Burke, Elizabeth Kitchenman Coyne, Hilde Foss, Etelka J. Greenfield, Reba Klein, Naomi Lavin, Maude C. Lewis, Beatrice Claire (or Clare) Overton and Elsie Reber. Edith Townsend Scarlett was Caucasian, and Sarai Sherman was described as Italian-American.
The exhibition “We Speak: Black Artists of Philadelphia, 1920s-1970s”, held at the Woodmere Art Museum in January 2016, examined the influence of the Pyramid Club and other Philadelphia institutions on African-American artists.
Photographs.
The Pyramid Club and other centers of African-American culture and life in Philadelphia were extensively photographed by photographer John W. Mosley. 
Mosley worked as the staff photographer for the Pyramid Club for a number of years. He published an annual album of photographs for the club, the "Pictorial Album of the Pyramid Club". 
The Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection at Temple University contains more than 300,000 photographs taken by Mosley.
A retrospective of Mosley's work, "A Million Faces: The Photography of John W. Mosley", appeared at the Woodmere Art Museum in Philadelphia in 2016.

Lawrence Grant White

Lawrence Grant White (September 26, 1887 – September 8, 1956) was an American architect, a partner in the architectural firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White, co-founded by his father Stanford White, and for five years the president of the National Academy of Design.
Early life.
Lawrence White, who was known as Larry, was born in New York City in 1887, the only surviving child of renowned architect Stanford White (1853–1906) and Elizabeth "Bessie" Springs (née Smith) White (1862–1950). His only sibling, an elder brother who died in infancy in 1885, was named after his paternal grandfather Richard Grant White, a Shakespearean scholar, husband of Alexina Black (née Mease) White. Larry White's maternal grandparents were John Lawrence Smith (1816–1889) and Sarah Nicoll (née Clinch) Smith (1823–1890), members of the family after which Smithtown is named. An uncle, James Clinch Smith, died aboard the RMS "Titanic" in 1912.
White grew up at Box Hill, a farmhouse converted to an Italianate mansion by his architect father, situated on his parent's 60-acre Long Island estate. In 1906, when he was almost 20 years old, his father was shot and killed by Harry K. Thaw over the father's affair with Thaw's wife, Evelyn Nesbit.
Career.
In 1908, White earned an A.B. degree "cum laude" from Harvard University, and in 1913, he received a diploma from the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. From 1915 until 1917, he worked at McKim, Mead &amp; White (as did his Harvard classmate and fellow architect Frederic Rhinelander King).
McKim, Mead &amp; White.
In 1919, after serving in the navy during World War I, he re-joined the architectural firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White, co-founded in 1879 by his late father with William Rutherford Mead and Charles Follen McKim.
At McKim, Mead &amp; White, he worked closely with William Mitchell Kendall. He designed the Hotel Nacional in Havana, Cuba, and the (since destroyed) Savoy-Plaza Hotel on Fifth Avenue in New York. He also designed the Pennsylvania Railroad Station in Newark, 52 Wall Street, the Regimental Barracks on Governors Island, and the Girard Trust Company offices in Philadelphia.
Chanler was a social acquaintance of Mildred Barnes Bliss and Robert Woods Bliss who were friends with Edith Wharton and Margaret Chanler, his wife's mother. The Bliss' engaged White and the firm to design the buildings of the Service Group at Dumbarton Oaks as well as the Music Room and the East Bay of the living room.
White served as the president of the National Academy of Design for five years and a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art shortly before his death. According to "The New York Times", White was "a renaissance man" who "wrote light verse, painted, played the piano and published a translation of Dante's "Inferno"." In fact in 1948 he published a translation of Dante's entire Divine Comedy.
Personal life.
On June 19, 1916, Larry White married Laura Astor Chanler (1887–1984), the eldest child of Winthrop Astor Chanler and Margaret Louisa (née Terry) Chanler; a descendant of the Ward, Astor, Dudley–Winthrop, Livingston and Stuyvesant families; and a painter and sculptor who trained at the Académie Julian in Paris. Together, they raised eight children at Box Hill:
Larry White died on September 8, 1956, at his home in St. James, New York. He was buried at Saint James Episcopal Church graveyard in St. James.
Descendants.
Lawrence Grant White has many descendants, including Genevieve White Carter, an interior designer.

Basilica of Santa Maria a Pugliano

The Basilica of Santa Maria a Pugliano is the main church in Ercolano and the oldest church in the area around Mount Vesuvius.
The church contains two pagan marble sarcophagi from the 2nd and 4th centuries AD, later adapted into Christian altars, probably in the 11th century. There are records of an oratory dedicated to the Virgin Mary in the 11th century on a hill called Pugliano, whose name probably derives from the 'praedium pollianum', a farm on the outskirts of Ercolano belonging to someone called Pollio or Pollione. One noblewoman in Naples in 1076 left legacies to various churches in the city as well as to 'S.Maria at Pugnanum tari 8'. Her will is the oldest document that confirms the existence and the high reputation of the church in the 11th century. During the following centuries the church's popularity increased more and more and pilgrims flooded here from everywhere. In the early years after the Council of Trent the church obtained formal acknowledgement of its eminence: in 1574 was first mentioned as "basilica"; two years later became the parish church of Resina and Portici and by papal bull on 13 June 1579 Pope Gregory XIII confirmed the plenary indulgences of his predecessors to the pilgrims visiting the church on the first Friday of March, Easter Day and 15 August, Assumption day. In that century main works were made to enlarge and embellish the church. During the eruption of 1631 the churc was miraculously spared by the lava. Some years later a new street (via Pugliano) was built on the solidified lava to easily reach the church from the town centre. On 18 October 1849 Pope Pius IX, hosted in the royal palace of Portici by the king of Naples during his exile from Rome, visited the basilica.
The church is worth a visit for its remarkable history and art treasures: the massive 36-meter high belfry from the end of the 16th century is one of the oldest of the area. Inside the church, there are sarcophagi from the 2nd and 4th centuries AD, that prove the existence of inhabitants in the area of Herculaneum in the aftermath of the eruption in AD 79; the exquisite wooden statues of Madonna di Pugliano and Black Crucifix, both of the 14th century; the font of 1425, one of the oldest outside the cathedral of Naples; the high altar, of the 16th century; the wooden bust of St. Januarius of the 17th century, the magnificent wooden pulpit of 1685, coeval to the wooden choir and behind the altar. Most of the paintings were made by local artists in the 16th and 17th centuries.
The Madonna di Pugliano is worshipped since ever, but before the statue of the 14th century the painted Byzantine-like Madonna di Ampellone was venerated. The main patronal festival is on 15 August, Assumption Day. A special worship is dedicated to St. Januarius, that is co-patron of Ercolano; the statue of the saint has always been carried in procession during the eruptions of Mt. Vesuvius toward the lava front. A bust of St. Januarius facing Mt. Vesuvius was frequently erected in villas and buildings to protect them by the fury of Mt. Vesuvius.

East Lawn Memorial Park

East Lawn Memorial Park is a cemetery in the western United States, located in East Sacramento, California. It is owned by East Lawn Memorial Parks &amp; Mortuaries, which also owns two other Sacramento area cemeteries. Founded in 1904, it is the resting place of several former Mayors of Sacramento as well as other public figures.
History.
The cemetery was founded in October 1904, in response to the Edwards Break Flood of 1904. The first burials took place on December 24th of that year. During the early 1900s the park was administered by the East Lawn Cemetery Association. The cemetery has a two-story mausoleum that was completed in 1926, after several years of public opposition, led by a developer that had hoped to transition the memorial land into a residential zone. Despite the city council’s approval of the variance require to build the mausoleum, the developer put the issue on the upcoming election ballot. During the campaign, East Lawn made public statements that the families of those interred would not give their permission to move the remains of their loved ones beneath the ground of the cemetery.
In 2013 the park began to transition from vegetation to rock based gardens where appropriate to contend with seasonal drought conditions and water availability problems in northern California. In November of that year the cemetery had its one hundred thousandth interment. Those interred in the cemetery include actor Neville Brand, professional baseball player James M. Grilk, composer Dick Jurgens, congressman Robert Matsui, and actress Dorothy Millette Bern. Former Mayors of Sacramento buried here include William Land, Clinton White, Hiram Hendren, Joe Serna, William Curtis, and Newton Earp.
Events.
The cemetery also holds public memorial events, such as a 2012 event memorializing the deaths of all indigents in the Sacramento area since its founding. Since 2003, the cemetery has dedicated memorials to those who have died in the region without a proper burial.

Nchare Yen

Nchare Yen, also referred to simply as Nchare, or by the English styling of the name as Nshare Yen, or just Nshare ( - 1418), was the founder of the Kingdom of Bamum, and one of the four kings who are mainly worshiped in the traditional Bamum religion due to their achievements in the Bamum society and culture. Nchare Yen is the brother of Ngon Nso, the founder of the Kingdom of Nso. Nchare Yen was the son of an unknown Tikar chief, who him and his sister broke away from to establish their own kingdoms. According to the book Rock of God, which discusses Nso history,Nso and Bamoun had been constantly quibbling, and to many, this seemed to be mostly sibling rivalry than any unavoidable conflict. Since Nso was founded by the sister (Ngon Nso), the brother (Nchare-Yen, founder of Bamoum) always saw himself as the successor to the throne of Nso, according to the Tikar tradition that they both knew and respected.According to one of the former leaders of the Bamum, Seidou Njimoluh Njoya, in a 1977 interview, described Nchare Yen as being a "short man with a protuberant stomach", who was "dark in complexion, had short limbs, but was very courageous", and also "loved dancing and drinking palm wine [but was] said to have been very charitable." Most of what is known about Nchare Yen has been passed down from both historical, religious, and cultural sources in Bamum society, and due to the obscurity of the subject matter, there is very little in the way of evidence to verify the claims given about the events of Nchare Yen's life.

Jari Huttunen

Jari Huttunen (born 28 February 1994) is a Finnish rally driver from Kiuruvesi. He currently competes in the World Rally Championship-2, the premier support category of the World Rally Championship, for Hyundai Motorsport. He gained notoriety in the championship after winning his very first rally in the WRC-2 category, at the 2017 Rally Finland.
Career.
2013–2014.
At the age of 19 in 2013, Huttunen decided to retire from go-kart competition and put a primary focus on rallying. He was hired by the AKK Driver Academy, and started in local rallying with a Suzuki Swift. After only achieving 57th place in one rally, Huttunen then switched it out for an Opel Kadett, and took a class win at the Oulujärvi Rally while placing 5th overall. In 2014, Huttunen continued to drive an Opel, but he switched the Kadett out for an Astra. At the Pohjola rally, he recorded 4th place overall, and another class win, which was a major improvement from his 57th place in the year before. Despite middling results, Huttunen obtained enough funding to make his debut in the Finnish Rally Championship. AKK Driver Academy supplied him with a Citroën C2 R2 car at the final two rallies of the 2014 championship. These rallies were his first in FIA-homologated machinery. In the last rally of the season, he scored a podium finish in the junior class.
2015: Breakout years, hired by Printsport &amp; WRC debut.
The 2015 season would be his breakout year into the junior categories of rallying in Finland. Still a member of the AKK Academy, Printsport hired Huttunen as a full-time driver in the 2015 Finnish championship in the R2 junior class, driving a Citroën C2 R2, like he did the previous season. Huttunen opened the 2015 season with a podium finish at the Arctic Lapland Rally, his first long-distance event. As the season went forward, Huttunen would go on to take two class wins and two more class podiums. Later on in the season, at Rally Finland, Huttunen would make his World Rally Championship début in the WRC-3 class. He was running in 4th until he crashed in the 2nd leg which forced him to retire for the day. He finished the rally in an unremarkable 8th position. All this did not slow him down however, as by the end of the season he won the SM3 Class of the Finnish Rally Championship, his first regional championship win. With this, he was named "Rally Star of the Future" by the organizers of the Finnish Championship.
2016: Move to the German Championship.
After success in his home country, Huttunen entered in the Deutsche Rallye Meisterschaft (German Rally Championship) full-time in the Opel Rallye Cup class, in which all entrants enter a spec Opel Adam. It was in this championship where he really shined. Huttunen would end up winning all rallies in the championship except for one, and thus easily took the Opel Rallye Cup. Huttunen's domination of the German championship meant that he qualified for Opel's Junior Rally Team in the European Rally Championship the following season.
2017: Opel &amp; breakout onto the international scene.
Jari Huttunen began a full-time program in the European Rally Championship's ERC-3 junior category for Opel, and a few more regional rallies alongside. Huttunen had a team-mate to join him in the ERC-3 class, the British Chris Ingram. The season started strong for Huttunen, taking a victory in the Finnish and German championships each. In the ERC however, he found himself regularly outpaced by Ingram, and with half the year by, he only took 2nd at the Canary Islands Rally. Then Huttunen returned to the World Rally Championship in its premier support category, the World Rally Championship-2, racing for Printsport at the Rally Finland. Racing a Škoda Fabia R5, this rally marked his second in four-wheel drive machinery, after a brief shakedown in a regional rally a few weeks earlier. Much to the surprise of many people, he won the WRC-2 class on his début in Finland, winning by 2 minutes and 17.8 seconds over Quentin Gilbert. It was only his second ever rally in the World Rally Championship itself. Huttunen ran the rest of his course with the Opel Junior Team, eventually finishing 3rd in the European Rally Championship-3 class. After the ERC season ended, Hyundai Motorsport ran Huttunen, along with many other hopeful drivers, on two test stages to choose a driver for their 2018 Hyundai R5 development program. Against stiff competition from the likes of Karl Kruuda, Gus Greensmith, Kalle Rovanperä and Pierre-Louis Loubet, Huttunen was chosen for the program. Huttunen's first rally with Hyundai was at Great Britain, at the end of the 2017 season. He failed to finish with mechanical issues after five stages.
2018: Full season as a Hyundai junior.
For the 2018 season, Huttunen took part in selected WRC-2 events for Hyundai Motorsport, which started with the Rally Sweden and Rally Mexico. Huttunen struggled in these rallies, failing to overcome the more competitive packages of Škoda Motorsport and Tommi Mäkinen Racing at Sweden, coming home 6th in the WRC-2 class. In Mexico, Huttunen was forced out of both legs 1 and 2 early due to mechanical failures, and finished 6th once again, this time over an hour behind class winner Pontus Tidemand. Despite these faults, Huttunen came back stronger later in the season. In his return to Rally Finland, he fought for WRC-2 class victory throughout most of the stages, and eventually finished a competitive second in the WRC-2 class, behind WRC-debutante Eerik Pietarinen. Huttunen also made a return to the European Rally Championship for Rally Poland, this time fighting for overall honours with a BRC Racing Team-entered Hyundai. Huttunen was in the running for victory the entire rally, his closest opponent being Nikolay Gryazin in Sports Racing Technologies. Despite a late charge in the final stages, a 10-second penalty meant he was forced to settle for second place once again. Huttunen capped off his development season with Hyundai at the Wales Rally GB, in which he finished 4th in the WRC-2 class, thus securing an 8th place finish in the World Rally Championship-2 standings.
2019.
After a moderately successful season, Huttunen's role in the Hyundai junior development program was reduced, due to Hyundai putting greater focus on winning the World Rally Championship outright. In his initial start for the 2019 season, he returned to Škoda customer team Printsport for Rally Sweden on a one-rally deal. He performed very strongly and even won the SS8 outright over the main WRC field, an unprecedented feat in R5 rallying. Huttunen would win seven stages over the course of the event, but despite a late charge to catch the WRC-2 class leader Ole Christian Veiby, he would crash out with just two stages to go, running second. Huttunen would return to the Hyundai program with a 3rd place finish at the Pirelli International Rally, a round of the British Rally Championship.
2020: Winning in WRC-3 and Polish Rally Championship.
2020 was a successful year for Huttunen. His co-driver was, once again, Mikko Lukka. The Finnish crew used a Hyundai i20 R5 in the championship. 
Huttunen participated in 4 rounds of WRC-3. He won the Rally Sweden and Rally Italia Sardegna in WRC-3 class, he also finished second in Rally Estonia and third in ACI Rally Monza. All of his effort resulted in 83 points, 5 over Marco Bulacia Wilkinson and the championship. He was also able to score 9 WRC points, which gave him the 14th place in the overall WRC classification. 
Huttunen also participated in Polish Rally Championship, which due to COVID-19 consisted only 3 rounds. Huttunen won the 2020 MARMA Rajd Rzeszowski and the 2020 Rajd Śląska. He also finished second at 2020 championship finale, the 2020 Rajd Świdnicki KRAUSE. All of that gave him 93 points - enough to score the title ahead of Grzegorz Grzyb (85 points). 
Huttunen also participated in the tests of the new Hyundai i20 Rally2.

Bethmaus

Bethmaus, () or Beth Maʿon (), was a Jewish village during the late Second Temple and Mishnaic periods, and which was already a ruin ("Tell Maʿūn") when Kitchener visited the site in 1877. It was situated upon the hill, directly north-west of the old city of Tiberias, at a distance of one biblical mile, rising to an elevation of above sea-level. It is now incorporated within the modern city bounds of Upper Tiberias.
The Midrash ("Genesis Rabba" § 85:7) says of the village, "Beth Maʿon, they ascend to it from Tiberias, but they go down to it from Kefar Shobtai." The Jerusalem Talmud, citing a variant account, says that they would go down to Beth Maʿon from its broad place.
History.
Based on the potsherds found "in situ", the place was inhabited as early as the Bronze Age and Iron Age. 
Josephus, the Jewish general turned historian, mentions that when he was put in charge of the public affairs of Galilee by the people of Jerusalem during the war with Rome, he moved with two of his fellow-legates who were priests of Aaron's lineage from Sepphoris to the village "Bethmaus" (henceforth: Beth Maʿon), a village situated four furlongs (stadia) distant from Tiberias. It was at Beth Maʿon that Josephus met Justus of Tiberias. There, they convened a meeting with the principal persons of Tiberias, to discuss a plan to demolish a house built by Herod the Tetrarch in Tiberias, and which had the figures of living creatures in it (contrary to Jewish law), but to restore the royal furniture of that house, consisting of candlesticks made of Corinthian brass, and of royal tables, and of a great quantity of uncoined silver, to the king. However, when Josephus took leave of Beth Maʿon and went into Upper Galilee, before Josephus and the senate of Tiberias could carry out their schemes, certain mariners and poor people of Galilee had plundered the house built by Herod of its effects, and taken away the spoils.
In the early 2nd-century CE, following the Bar Kokhba revolt, Beth Maʿon became the residence of one of the priestly clans known as "Ḥuppah". Around this time, representatives of the twenty-four priestly wards moved and settled in the Galilee. In the 20th-century, three stone inscriptions were discovered bearing the names of the priestly wards, their order and the name of the locality to which they had moved after the destruction of the Second Temple: In 1920, a stone inscription was found in Ashkelon showing a partial list of the priestly wards; in 1962 three small fragments of one Hebrew stone inscription bearing the partial names of places associated with the priestly courses (the rest of which had been reconstructed) were found in Caesarea Maritima, dated to the third-fourth centuries; in 1970 a stone inscription was found on a partially buried column in a mosque, in the Yemeni village of Bayt al-Ḥaḍir, showing ten names of the priestly wards and their respective towns and villages. The Yemeni inscription is the longest roster of names of this sort ever discovered unto this day, and mentions the priestly course in Beth Maʿon. The seventh-century poet, Eleazar ben Killir, echoing the same tradition, also wrote a liturgical poem detailing the 24-priestly wards and their places of residence. 
In extant Turkish documents dating to May 1566, the Ottoman ruler, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, ordered that water be drawn from Beth Maʿon and brought to Tiberias, the purpose of which is not now known, although thought to have been for agricultural crops. By April 1566, when the work had not yet been completed and the workers (under Don Joseph Nasi) demanded more money from the Sultan to complete the project, the Sultan refused to set aside more money for the project. Below Beth Maʿon, between the ruins of the ancient village and Tiberias, are found two natural springs.

Automorphism group

In mathematics, the automorphism group in one of its most general forms is defined in the context of category theory. In category theory, the automorphism group of an object "X" is the group consisting of automorphisms of "X". The most famous example is the formula_1, which is the group of automorphisms on a group like formula_2, another one is the general linear group: if "X" is a finite-dimensional vector space, then the automorphism group of "X" is the group of invertible linear transformations from "X" to itself.
Especially in geometric contexts, an automorphism group is also called a symmetry group. A subgroup of an automorphism group is called a transformation group (especially in old literature).
In category theory.
Automorphism groups appear very naturally in category theory.
If "X" is an object in a category, then the automorphism group of "X" is the group consisting of all the invertible morphisms from "X" to itself. It is the unit group of the endomorphism monoid of "X". (For some examples, see PROP.)
If formula_6 are objects in some category, then the set formula_7 of all formula_8 is a left formula_9-torsor. In practical terms, this says that a different choice of a base point of formula_7 differs unambiguously by an element of formula_9, or that each choice of a base point is precisely a choice of a trivialization of the torsor.
If formula_29 and formula_30 are objects in categories formula_31 and formula_32, and if formula_33 is a functor mapping formula_29 to formula_30, then formula_36 induces a group homomorphism formula_37, as it maps invertible morphisms to invertible morphisms.
In particular, if "G" is a group viewed as a category with a single object * or, more generally, if "G" is a groupoid, then each functor formula_38, "C" a category, is called an action or a representation of "G" on the object formula_39, or the objects formula_40. Those objects are then said to be formula_2-objects (as they are acted by formula_2); cf. formula_43-object. If formula_44 is a module category like the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces, then formula_2-objects are also called formula_2-modules.
Automorphism group functor.
Let formula_47 be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field "k" that is equipped with some algebraic structure (that is, "M" is a finite-dimensional algebra over "k"). It can be, for example, an associative algebra or a Lie algebra.
Now, consider "k"-linear maps formula_48 that preserve the algebraic structure: they form a vector subspace formula_49 of formula_50. The unit group of formula_49 is the automorphism group formula_52. When a basis on "M" is chosen, formula_50 is the space of square matrices and formula_49 is the zero set of some polynomial equations, and the invertibility is again described by polynomials. Hence, formula_52 is a linear algebraic group over "k".
Now base extensions applied to the above discussion determines a functor: namely, for each commutative ring "R" over "k", consider the "R"-linear maps formula_56 preserving the algebraic structure: denote it by formula_57. Then the unit group of the matrix ring formula_57 over "R" is the automorphism group formula_59 and formula_60 is a group functor: a functor from the category of commutative rings over "k" to the category of groups. Even better, it is represented by a scheme (since the automorphism groups are defined by polynomials): this scheme is called the automorphism group scheme and is denoted by formula_52.
In general, however, an automorphism group functor may not be represented by a scheme.

Innico Caracciolo (born 1607)

Innico Caracciolo the Elder (7 March 1607, Airola - 6 September 1685, Naples) was a Roman Catholic priest, cardinal and archbishop.
Life.
Cracciolo was the son of Francesco, 2nd Duke of Airola and Isabella Guevara, Duchess of Bovino. This made him the uncle of cardinal Innico Caracciolo the Younger.
He studied under the Jesuits in Naples and later studied philosophy and law. He moved to Rome and took several minor posts in the Roman Curia. Under Pope Urban VIII he was made protonotary apostolic, 'referendario' to the tribunals of the Segnatura Apostolica di Giustizia e di Grazia, cleric of the Camera Apostolica and president of the Annona. He was judge of the Fabbrica di San Pietro, 'relatore' of the Sacra Congregazione del Buon Governo and of the electors of the Tribunale della Segnatura Apostolica under pope Clement X. He was deacon of the clerics of the Camera Apostolica.
He was made a cardinal in pectore at the 15 February 1666 consistory, with his appointment made public on 7 March 1667—the same date he was made Archbishop of Naples. He participated in the conclave of 1667 which elected pope Clement IX. He received the cardinal's biretta and the "titulus" of San Clemente on 18 July 1667. He also took part in the papal conclave, 1669-1670 which elected Clement X. He celebrated diocesan synods in 1669, 1672, 1676 and 1680. He took part in a third conclave in 1676, which elected pope Innocent XI. He was buried in a marble tomb in Naples Cathedral in the form of a tabernacle held up by four columns that was designed by Pietro Ghetti.

Eighth Xhosa War

The Eighth Xhosa War was a war between the British Empire and Xhosa as well as Khoikhoi forces, between 1850 and 1853. It was the eighth of nine Xhosa Wars.
Background.
Large numbers of Xhosa were displaced across the Keiskamma by Governor Harry Smith, and these refugees supplemented the original inhabitants there, causing overpopulation and hardship. Those Xhosa who remained in the colony were moved to towns and encouraged to adopt European lifestyles.
Harry Smith also attacked and annexed the independent Orange Free State, hanging the Boer resistance leaders, and in the process alienating the Burghers of the Cape Colony. To cover the mounting expenses he then imposed exorbitant taxes on the local people of the frontier and cut the Cape's standing forces to less than five thousand men.
In June 1850 there followed an unusually cold winter, together with an extreme drought. It was at this time that Smith ordered the displacement of large numbers of Xhosa squatters from the Kat River region.
The war became known as "Mlanjeni's War", after the prophet Mlanjeni who arose among the homeless Xhosa, and who predicted that the Xhosa would be unaffected by the colonists' bullets. Large numbers of Xhosa began leaving the colony's towns and mobilizing in the tribal areas.
The Outbreak of War.
Believing that the chiefs were responsible for the unrest caused by Mlanjeni's preaching, Governor Sir Harry Smith travelled to meet with the prominent chiefs. When Sandile refused to attend a meeting outside Fort Cox, Governor Smith deposed him and declared him a fugitive. On 24 December, a British detachment of 650 men under Colonel Mackinnon was ambushed by Xhosa warriors in the Boomah Pass. The party was forced to retreat to Fort White, under heavy fire from the Xhosa, having sustained forty-two casualties. The very next day, during Christmas festivities in towns throughout the border region, apparently friendly Xhosa entered the towns to partake in the festivities. At a given signal though, they fell upon the settlers who had invited them into their homes and killed them. With this attack, the bulk of the Ngqika joined the war.
Opening Stages of the War.
While the Governor was still at Fort Cox, the Xhosa forces advanced on the colony, isolating him there. The Xhosa burned British military villages along the frontier and captured the post at Line Drift. Meanwhile, the Khoi of the Blinkwater River Valley and Kat River Settlement revolted, under the leadership of a half-Khoi, half-Xhosa chief Hermanus Matroos, and managed to capture Fort Armstrong. Large numbers of the "Kaffir Police" — a paramilitary police force the British had established to combat cattle theft — deserted their posts and joined Xhosa war parties. For a while, it appeared that all of the Xhosa and Khoi people of the eastern Cape were taking up arms against the British.
Harry Smith finally fought his way out of Fort Cox with the help of the local Cape Mounted Riflemen, but found that he had alienated most of his local allies. His policies had made enemies of the Burghers and Boer Commandos, the Fengu, and the Khoi, who formed much of the Cape's local defences. Disaffection about their treatment by the English authorities even spread among the traditionally loyal Cape Mounted Riflemen, with some units of Khoi descent defecting to the Xhosa rebels.
The British Counter-Attack (January 1851).
After these initial successes, however, the Xhosa experienced a series of setbacks. Xhosa forces were repulsed in separate attacks on Fort White and Fort Hare. Similarly, on 7 January, Hermanus and his supporters launched an offensive on the town of Fort Beaufort, which was defended by a small detachment of troops and local volunteers. The attack failed however, and Hermanus was killed. The Cape Government also eventually agreed to levy a force of local gunmen (predominantly Khoi) to hold the frontier, allowing Smith to free some imperial troops for offensive action.
By the end of January, the British were beginning to receive reinforcements (2nd Division) from Cape Town and a force under Colonel Mackinnon was able to drive north from King William's Town to resupply the beleaguered garrisons at Fort White, Fort Cox and Fort Hare. With fresh men and supplies, the British expelled the remainder of Hermanus' rebel forces (now under the command of Willem Uithaalder) from Fort Armstrong and drove them west toward the Amatola Mountains. Over the coming months, increasing numbers of Imperial troops arrived, reinforcing the heavily outnumbered British and allowing Smith to lead sweeps across the frontier country.
In 1852, HMS "Birkenhead" was wrecked at Gansbaai while bringing reinforcements to the war at the request of Sir Harry Smith. As the ship sank, the men (mostly new recruits) stood silently in rank, while the women and children were loaded into the lifeboats. They remained in rank as the ship slipped under and over 300 died.
Conclusion.
Insurgents led by Maqoma established themselves in the forested Waterkloof. From this base they managed to plunder surrounding farms and torch the homesteads. Maqoma's stronghold was situated on Mount Misery, a natural fortress on a narrow neck wedged between the Waterkloof and Harry's Kloof. The Waterkloof conflicts lasted two years. Maqoma also led an attack on Fort Fordyce and inflicted heavy losses on the forces of Sir Harry Smith.
In February 1852, the British Government decided that Sir Harry Smith's inept rule had been responsible for much of the violence, and ordered him replaced by George Cathcart, who took charge in March. For the last six months, Cathcart ordered scourings of the countryside for rebels. In February 1853, Sandile and the other chiefs surrendered.
The 8th frontier war was the most bitter and brutal in the series of Xhosa wars. It lasted over two years and ended in the complete subjugation of the Ciskei Xhosa.

Microtis eremaea

Microtis eremaea, commonly known as the slender mignonette orchid or inland onion orchid is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia and western South Australia. It has a single thin, hollow, onion-like leaf and up to fifty small greenish-yellow flowers. The flowers have a distinctive heart-shaped labellum and the orchid generally grows in more inland areas than most other onion orchids.
Description.
"Microtis eremaea" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between ten and fifty yellowish-green flowers are crowded along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are long, wide with an ovary long. The dorsal sepal is long, about wide and hood-like. The lateral sepals are about long, wide with their tips rolled downwards. The petals are long, wide and are partly enclosed by the dorsal sepal. The labellum is heart-shaped, long, about wide and curves downwards with slightly wavy edges. Flowering occurs from August to October.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Microtis eremaea" was first formally described in 1996 by Robert Bates from a specimen collected on a granite outcrop west of Mount Magnet and the description was published in "Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden". The specific epithet ("eremaea") is derived from Latin "eremaea", referring to the arid habitat of this orchid.
Distribution and habitat.
"Microtis eremaea" mostly grows on granite outcrops or near temporary watercourses, sometimes forming dense colonies. It is found between Balladonia and Cue in Western Australia and in the west of South Australia.
Conservation.
"Microtis eremaea" is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Bulgo Sandstone

Bulgo Sandstone is a sedimentary rock occurring in the Sydney Basin in eastern Australia. This stratum is up to 100 metres thick, formed in the early Triassic. A component of the Narrabeen Group of sedimentary rocks. It consists of layers of fine to medium-grained quartz-lithic sandstone, with lenticular shale interbeds.
Often seen as a grey-green colour when exposed, the Bulgo sandstone contains a high level of particles of volcanic rocks, and is dissimilar to other Sydney sandstones, such as Hawkesbury sandstone and Newport Formation. The rock breaks down to create a relatively fertile clayey soil. These soils contribute to the rainforest growth in the northern Illawarra. Bulgo sandstone may be seen at the "figure eight" rock pool at Royal National Park and at Long Reef in the northern Beaches in Sydney. A fossil of the giant salamander (Bulgosuchus gargantua) was found at Long Reef.

Hagre l'Escot

Hagre l'Escot was a Scottish mercenary captain during the Hundred Years War.
He fought for Edward III in 1360, and on the Black Prince's expedition to Castile in 1366.
After the Treaty of Brétigny Hagre and his men found themselves unemployed and so become one of the 30 so-called Tard-Venus bandits, that ranged the French country side pillaging towns. This led Avignon Pope Innocent VI to preach a "crusade against the robbers", and French King John II to "pay off" the brigands with gold to go to Italy.
His story is mentioned in the Chronicles of Froissart which holds that: Guin de Batefol: he had on his way well two thousand combatants. There were Talebart Talebardon, Guiot du Pin, Espiote, the Petite Meschin, Batillier, Francois Hennequin, de Bourc Camus, the Bourc of L'Espare, Naudon de Bagerent, Bourc de Bretuel, Lamit, Hagre l'Escot , Albrest Ourri the German, Borduel, Bernart de la Salle, Robert Briquet, Carsuelle, Aymon of Ortinge, Garsiot of Chastel, Guionnet of Paux, Hortingo de la Salle and several others. If these Companies advised, about mid-Lent, that they were trailing towards Avignon and would go to see the pope and the cardinals: if they passed and entered and ran in the county of Mâcon; and they came to the county of Forez for this good country and to Lyon on the Rhone.
There is some debate among modern scholars over whether he is or is not identifiable with [[Thomas Stewart, 2nd Earl of Angus].

10-Piece handicap

The 10-Piece (十枚落ち "jūmai-ochi") handicap in shogi has all of White's pieces removed except for the king and their line of pawns. (Thus, their rook, bishop, golds, silvers, knights, and lances are all missing.)
This handicap is very severe and, thus, not competitive. It is not deemed an official handicap of the Japan Shogi Association. Its purpose is primarily for teaching shogi novices how to play. 
In this handicap, a major pedagogical point is how to activate Black's bishop and then promote it. Finally, as with all large handicaps, Black should try to achieve a mating position in the fewest moves possible as well as preventing White from creating an Entering King situation in which it may be impossible to mate White.
Opening.
1...K-42. The most reasonable move for White is to protect their pawns on the 53, 43, and 33 squares.
Once Black opens their bishop diagonal, the 33 square is in the direct line of fire of Black's bishop.
If White made a first move of 1...K-62, after 2.P-76, White's king does not have to time to move to the 42 square in order to protect 33 and White would promote their bishop with 3.Bx33+.
2.P-76. Part of the main pedagogical point of this handicap: activate the bishop by opening its diagonal with a pawn push on the seventh file.
This move prepares an exit hatch for the bishop so that it might move outside of Black's camp and attack one of White's undefended pawns and simultaneously promote.
Although it may be possible to activate the rook instead with a pawn push on the second file (with 2.P-26 aiming for 3.P-25 and 4.P-24), this is slower than activating the bishop since the bishop can immediately become mobile outside of Black's camp after 2.P-76. Note that even in even games, activating the bishop with P-76 is the most frequent first move by either Black or White.
2...P-54. Although other moves may be possible, pushing the central file pawn has multiple purposes.
The most apparent reason is to prevent Black's bishop from moving to the 55 square. If White allowed this by, for instance, moving the king further to the side with 2...K32, after Black moves their bishop 3.B-55, Black would be able to promote their bishop on the seventh file on their next move with 4.Bx73+.
Although White cannot prevent Black's bishop from promoting with only a single king defending their line of pawns, it is preferable that Black's bishop promote on a file that is further away from White's king such as the ninth file.
A second reason for the central pawn development is to give White's king the possibility of advancing up to the 53 square. In very large handicaps like this 10-Piece Handicap, White must use their king very actively typically advancing their king upward behind previously advanced pawns.
3.B-66. Moving the bishop to the 66 square aims Black's bishop on the 93 square where it can promote. This is the second teaching point of this handicap.
Although White has thwarted Black's attempts to promote their bishop on the 33 and 73 squares with 1...K-42 and 2...P-54, there is no way for White to prevent a promotion on the ninth file with the king so far way and there being no lance on 91 protecting the ninth file as is the case in even games. 
Even if White tries to prevent Black from capturing the ninth file pawn by pushing the pawn with 3...P-94, it is of little consequence since the promotion of the bishop is the important issue. After the bishop promotion, Black will be in a good position.
Ishibashi example.
3...P-64. This pawn push gives White the option of moving their king to the 63 square as well as continuing to push the sixth file pawn further to 65. Making this sixth file pawn push, of course, gives up White's ninth file pawn. However, in such an extreme handicap as this, White will play aggressively and ignore the small material loss.
4.Bx93+. Black captures White's pawn on 93 and promotes.
4...K-53. White moves their king to the center. 
5.P-26. Seeing White's move, Black opts to activate their rook with a pawn push since White's second file pawn is now undefended. For Ishibashi (2012: 35), this rook activation is the third pedagogical point of this handicap.
At this point, White can still move their king to defend the second file via 5...K-42 then 6...K-32. Even so, Black can still trade off their rook pawns with 6.P-25 7.P-24 Px24 8.Rx24. And, after a defending pawn drop 8...P*23 by White, Black's rook could capture White's central pawn with 9.Rx54 looking to promote the rook on the central file.
5...P-55. White continues pushing their central pawn forward making way for the king to advance further toward Black's camp. Ultimately, White aims to attack on the central file as Black's king remains in its original start position on that file.
6.P-25. Another forward match of the rook pawn to be followed by another push to the 24 square. 
Black aims to trade off this second file pawn so that the rook will have an unobstructed path to promote inside of White's camp. Since White has no pieces to defend on the second file, the rook promotion is inevitable.
6...K-54. King advances.
7.P-24. This pawn push is the beginning of the second file pawn exchange: Black's pawn attacks, White's pawn captures, and Black's rook recaptures.
7...Px24. White will capture Black's pawn now as otherwise Black will capture White's pawn and additionally promote their pawn themselves with 8.Px23+. Giving Black a pawn for free and allowing their pawn on the board to promote is too beneficial for Black.
8.Rx24. Rook recaptures. Now both players have a pawn in hand. The rook recapture also puts White's king on the 54 square in check.
8...P-44. White pushes their fourth file pawn in order to resolve Black's check by the rook.
9.R-22+. With its path cleared, Black's rook promotes. Promoting on rank 2 (as opposed to rank 1, for instance) also confines White's king to ranks 3 and below since the promoted rook is attacking along the entire rank 2.
9...K-45. White's king moves forward again to the fourth file. The aim here is to attack on the central file and the king positioned on 45 allows the king to recapture a pawn on the 56 square.

☖12...K-55.
12...K*55. White resolves Black's check (12.+B-72) by having the king flee from the bishop's attacking diagonal. (Another possibility is to interpose a pawn. See §12...P*54 below).
☖12...P*54.
12...P*54. Another way White could resolve Black's check (12.+B-72) is the drop an interposing pawn to the 54 square between the king and the bishop (instead of running with 12...K-55).

Thomas Gibbons (politician)

Thomas Gibbons (December 15, 1757 – May 16, 1826) was a planter, politician, lawyer, steamboat owner and the plaintiff in "Gibbons vs. Ogden".
Early life.
Gibbons was born at Mulberry Hill, his family's plantation outside of Savannah, Georgia on December 15, 1757. He was the son of Joseph Gibbons and Hannah (née Martin) Gibbons. Between 1752 and 1762, his father acquired several thousand acres between the Ogeechee and Savannah Rivers where he operated a saw mill, grew rice, and owned over 100 slaves.
He was educated at home and in Charleston, South Carolina, where he read law. During the American Revolutionary War,
Gibbons, who was just eighteen when it started, was a passive Loyalist.
Career.
Following the American's victory over the British, Gibbons and other remaining Tories was convicted of treason and he was considered a prisoner of the Sheriff of Chatham County. His estate was confiscated and only after executive order was he permitted to remain at his mother's and allowed and to pass between there and Savannah. In January 1783, Gibbons petitioned the Assembly for citizenship, which was granted six months later under the stipulation that he could not vote, hold office for 14 years, or practice law. However, in only four years, he was granted full rights and privileges of citizenship.
Between 1791 and 1801, only four years after being granted full rights of citizenship, Gibbons served several terms as the Mayor of Savannah, Georgia from 1791 to 1792, again in 1794 to 1795 and lastly from 1799 to 1801, as a Democratic-Republican. In addition to his service as mayor, he was also an aldermen of the city. In 1801, he was appointed a federal judge.
As mayor, Gibbons was the head of the Savannah delegation who welcomed U.S. President George Washington to Savannah during Washington's "ceremonial tour of the South" in May 1791.
Move to New Jersey.
In 1801, Gibbons moved north and purchased a summer house in Elizabethtown in New Jersey, where he purchased a large private dock facility a few years later. His neighbor was former United States Senator and New Jersey Governor Aaron Ogden.
Gibbons formed a partnership with Ogden, to operate steamboats. In 1817 Gibbons acquired a steam ferry, the "Stoudinger", built by Allaire Iron Works, as a Hudson River ferry business between Elizabethtown and New Brunswick, New Jersey. In 1818, he acquired "Bellona". Gibbons hired Cornelius Vanderbilt to captain the "Bellona". Over the next few years, he also purchased "Thistle", "Swan", and "Emerald". Vanderbilt biographer T.J. Stiles described Gibbons as "a staggeringly rich rice planter from Georgia." Gibbons turned out to be a mentor to Vanderbilt throughout his life. 
In 1818, Gibbons broke his partnership with neighbor Aaron Ogden and started competing with him, just months before Gibbons hired Vanderbilt. Ogden had acquired rights to a steamboat monopoly in New York waters. The monopoly had been granted by the New York State Legislature to the politically influential patrician Robert Livingston and Robert Fulton, who had designed the steamboat. Both Livingston and Fulton had died by the time Vanderbilt started working for Gibbons. The monopoly was held by Livingston's heirs. They had granted a license to Ogden to run a ferry between New York and New Jersey. Gibbons launched his steamboat venture because of a personal dispute with Ogden, whom he hoped to drive into bankruptcy. To accomplish this, he undercut Ogden's prices. Ogden then secured an injunction against Gibbons on October 21, 1818. This prompted Gibbons to bring a legal action to overturn the monopoly. The landmark legal case, known as "Gibbons vs. Ogden", was fought all the way to the United States Supreme Court, where Gibbons, represented by Daniel Webster and U.S. Attorney General William Wirt, eventually won in 1824.
Personal life.
In 1780, Gibbons was married to Ann Miles Heyward (1757–1820). Together, they were the parents of many children, only three of which survived to adulthood:
Gibbons died on May 16, 1826 in New York. He was "obese and diabetic from a life of rapacious eating and drinking."
Descendants.
Through his daughter Ann, he was the grandfather of Thomas Gibbons Trumbull, John Heyward Trumbull, and Hannah Gibbons Trumbull (1813–1876), who married Ralph Henry Isham, and Sarah Backus Trumbull (1815–1903), who married Daniel Coit Ripley (1812–1893). However, due to Gibbon's falling out with his son-in-law, no child of John Trumbull was able to inherit any piece of Gibbon's estate or property as dictated in Gibbons' scathing will.
Through his son William, he was the grandfather of Sarah Taintor Gibbons (1829–1909), who was married to Ward McAllister (1827–1895); and William Heyward Gibbons (1831–1887), William's only son. William Heyward sold the family mansion, known as the Gibbons Mansion, to Daniel Drew in 1867 for $140,000. Drew donated the mansion and grounds to found Drew Theological Seminary (now known as Drew University), named in his honor.

Francesco Pannocchieschi

Francesco Pannocchieschi d'Elci (1625 or 1626, Florence - 20 June 1702) was an Italian Roman Catholic priest and archbishop.
Life.
He came from a noble Sienese family of the Pannocchieschi d'Elci, who held the status of counts. He was the son of count Ranieri and a noblewoman from the Altoviti family. One of Ranieri's brothers was cardinal Scipione Pannocchieschi, whom Francesco accompanied during Scipione's Pontifical Legature to the Republic of Venice (1647-1652). Scipione's "Relazione sulle cose della repubblica" offers a glimpse of life in Venice at that time. Francesco also assisted Scipione to the court of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor in Germany (1653-1654).
This acted as an introduction to the church's life in Rome - Francesco became secret chamberlin or 'cubicularius' to the pope and canon of St Peter's Basilica. He succeeded his uncle as archbishop of Pisa in 1663 and made a solemn entrance into Pisa on 23 December 1663. He remained in Pisa for almost forty years, finally dying there on 20 June 1702.
Episcopal succession.
While bishop, he was the principal co-consecrator of:

Our Power

Our Power was an energy supply company backed by the Scottish government, one of the first in the UK to operate on a non-profit distribution basis. Our Power was entirely asset-locked, being owned by social housing providers, community organisations and local authorities.
The company failed to make a profit and ceased to trade on 25 January 2019. Subsequently, industry regulator Ofgem arranged for Utilita Energy to take over its 31,000 customers.
History.
Established in 2016 with 53 housing associations and local authorities as members, the company broadened its investor-base in late 2017 after raising £4.4 million from 301 investors via a social purpose bond. By the time it ceased trading, the company had received funds of £16.6m (including £9.8m from the Scottish government) via Our Power Community Benefit Society Limited.
At first the company relied on the member organisations switching the supply at their vacant properties to Our Power, in the hope that the incoming tenants would remain with the company. The company began to supply the wider market in Scotland from October 2017, and expanded to England and Wales in early 2018. In early 2019, around 80% of customers were in Scotland.
Trading losses were £1.9m in 2016 and almost £5m in 2017. In 2018 the directors of the community benefit society considered that further funding in the region of £7m was required.
Operations.
Personnel and members.
Our Power was based in Edinburgh and had 68 employees when it entered administration. By 2018 it worked with 67 social housing providers, community organisations and local authorities.
Expansion and diversification.
The company partnered with the charity Money Advice Scotland in late 2017 to launch a variable tariff for customers on restricted meters, who are unable to switch providers or access tariffs available to single-rate meter customers. With the aim of turning a profit by 2020, its fourth year of operation, Our Power extended their membership to include a Welsh housing association.
+IMPACT tariff.
In February 2018, Our Power introduced its first UK-wide tariff called +IMPACT, which the company defined as "100% green". It aimed to be competitively priced, with the ultimate goal being to "secure thousands of ethically-minded energy customers" by the end of the year. Our Power developed the tariff to bring energy costs down for families living in or at risk of fuel poverty.
Renewable energy investment.
In 2018, Our Power partnered with Mongoose Energy for the purpose of creating 'Our Community Energy', a renewable energy investment scheme, which directly linked renewable generation and not-for-profit ownership. The community organisation was launched in response to a survey which had found that more than a third of Scots (36%) admitted to living in fuel poverty, suggesting that this was particularly acute in the case of millennials, with over half of those aged 18–34 (56%) directly impacted. The scheme endeavours to utilize the power from two Scottish community-owned wind power projects, so that the companies can offer less expensive electricity to those most in need of cheaper energy. The wind farms in Pogbie, East Lothian and Brockholes, Berwickshire aspired to raise £2.9 million through bond and equity offers.
Failure.
Our Power Energy Supply Limited entered administration on 31 January 2019 with net debt of £29.9 million, including £4.9m owed to its parent community benefit society, and £3.3m owed to Utilita. The community benefit society also entered administration.

Where Are We Going?

Where Are We Going? is the fourth studio album of American house producer Maya Bouldry-Morrison, known by her stage name as Octo Octa. It was released in March 2017 by HNYTRX, a sub-imprint of queer label Honey Soundsystem. It is her first album to be released after publicly revealing in 2016 that she was transgender and contains a much more uplifting tone than the records she released before revealing her gender identity. While still following the classic house sound of her past releases, Bouldry-Morrison intended the LP to be a more "overt" statement than the "coded queer statement" of her previous album "Between Two Selves" (2013). The album was well received by critics and landed on the year-end lists of "Crack Magazine", "Mixmag", "Noisey", and "Resident Advisor".
Background and concept.
In an interview for "Resident Advisor" published on February 3, 2016, Bouldry-Morrison came out as a trans woman and claimed she was planning to start producing an album conceptually about her transitioning process. She wrote "Where Are We Going?" in 2016 shortly after doing the interview. She cites the records of DJ Sprinkles such as "Routes Not Roots" (2006) and "Midtown 120 Blues" (2008) as inspiration to make the record: "Being trans, seeing art that's publicly being written by a trans producer meant a lot to me. I was happy to find work that was openly talking about it."
Feeling that Bouldry-Morrison's previous album, "Between Two Selves" (2013) was a "coded queer statement," she wanted to make "Where Are We Going?" a more "overt" statement about her sexuality. As such, she moved from 100% Silk to a queer label named Honey Soundsystem to work with Jackie House on the album: "I really wanted to do this record with a overtly queer label. That was super important to me. Also, Jackie just is really good at helping me realize what it should be and what we should be doing around it." House handled many duties regarding the LP, such as the mastering of the songs and the record's promotion.
Composition.
"Where Are We Going?" continues Octo Octa's signature style of 1990s-inspired, Balearic-tinged piano-heavy chill-out house music. Differences from previous records include more complex compositions, less vocal samples, and a brighter tone: while her past releases contained uncertain feelings that reflected her worries regarding revealing her gender identity publicly, "Where Are We Going?" has an uplifting tone. However, it ends on a negative note with the second part of the title track. As she explained its meaning, "I’m good, overall, but I face a lot of unexpected interactions and emotions every day that I didn’t foresee before being out."
"No More Pain (Promises To A Younger Self)" and "Move On (Let Go) (De-stress Mix)" are the album's slower moments, departing from Octo Octa's house sound for "pensive piano lilts" and Amen breaks, summarized "Crack Magazine". For "No More Pain," Bouldry-Morrison intended to make the same type of IDM and breakcore that she used to produce as a teenager. Bouldry-Morrison made two versions of "Move On (Let Go)," the final one included on the album (the "De-stress Mix") and the "Stress Mix," which included a drum ’n’ bass-style bassline.
Cover art.
The cover art for "Where Are We Going" is a photograph taken by Jeffrey McMahan in a San Francisco hotel bedroom during a six-hour photoshoot session. It depicts Bouldry-Morrison kneeling on a bed wearing a mini-dress with her hair being blown by a wind machine. The aesthetic of the cover art differs heavily from those of her 100% Silk records, which used images of body parts and facial expressions of other people. This is because she made her transgender identity an essential part of the album: "For a long time I never took pictures of myself because I didn’t like my body. It’s only been a couple of years now, especially since publicly transitioning, that I’ve finally felt OK with how I look."
Critical reception.
"Mixmag", listing the album as one of the top 50 best LPs of 2017 (see Accolades), honored it as "a superlative example of timeless dance music." Writer Will Lynch claimed "Where Are We Going?" "reveals Bouldry-Morrison to be a mature and gifted producer." He praised its "inspired" production and ability of using sounds to represent the producer's personal life, something which was also spotlighted in a "Pitchfork" review of the album: "Bouldry-Morrison never feels bound to offer an answer, but through the vivid ambivalence of her music, you can sense a warming to new possibility." Lynch's only criticism of the record was that it sounded a little too much like the works of DJ Sprinkles, a major influence of Bouldry-Morrison's music.

Master's Apprentices (1971 album)

Master's Apprentices (re-titled Choice Cuts in Australia) is the third studio album by The Masters Apprentices, released in March 1971 on Regal Zonophone.
Background.
In mid-1969, The Masters Apprentices won a boat trip to England in Hoadley's "Battle of the Sounds". With this the group were set on breaking into the UK market. They worked to save money for the effort with a national farewell tour in April–May. On 25 May, they boarded the "Fairsky" for the UK, leaving their agency business in the hands of Adrian Barker. The six-week ocean voyage provided a break after years of constant gigging. Without the pressure and distraction of touring, they wrote and rehearsed new material. They had a stopover in Panama, where they were 'ripped off' while they bought some local marijuana. Arriving at the height of an English summer in July, the band entered a productive period. They moved into a hotel in Bayswater, but it was too expensive, so they moved to a house in North Harrow, London, where they continued to write and rehearse, and made contact with other Aussie expatriates. Freed from constant performing, they immersed themselves in the cultural life of London, going on shopping sprees for clothes in Kings Road, Chelsea, ploughing through scores of new records and doing the rounds of clubs and concerts, seeing the best music on offer.
Having only been advanced $500 by EMI Australia, bassist Glenn Wheatley started knocking on doors in hopes of getting the band established in London and possibly securing a record deal. Wheatley contacted EMI in London, and met Trudy Green, secretary to staff producer Jeff Jarratt. Green was later an artist manager for Heart, Janet Jackson and Mick Jagger. She liked the Australian band and got Jarratt interested, he agreed to produce them. EMI Australia agreed to pay for the album's recording, with EMI UK providing the artwork; the group were thrilled to record at the legendary Abbey Road Studios with Jarratt and engineer Peter Bown. Jarratt had worked on some of The Beatles' later recordings, and Brown's credits included Pink Floyd's "A Saucerful of Secrets", "Ummagumma" and "Atom Heart Mother".
Just before the start of recording, Keays made a trip to mainland Europe, and was in Copenhagen when he heard of the death of Jimi Hendrix, one of his idols. Back in London, Ford and Keays penned "Song for a Lost Gypsy", which they added to their songlist. The band entered the studio in September to record the new album. The staff and facilities were superior to those in Australia, which allowed a greater range of expression. The songs they brought to the sessions—many written during the voyage—were original and distinctive, distilling their recent musical influences. This included the heavier sounds of Hendrix, King Crimson and Free, as well as the acoustic styles of Donovan, the Small Faces and Van Morrison (whose "Astral Weeks" LP was on constant rotation at their North Harrow house). They brought in outside musicians to augment some tracks, and made use of Paul McCartney's white grand piano on a few cuts, including "Because I Love You". During sessions they bumped into a Who's Who of UK music: The Moody Blues, Pink Floyd, Barclay James Harvest, Ringo Starr and Roy Harper. Towards the end of recording, they found themselves one song short of the optimum LP length, so at Jarratt's suggestion they wrote a new song, built up from a Latin-flavoured instrumental shuffle that Ford had been playing with. Keays wrote lyrics for the piece overnight, they cut it the next day and it became the album's opening track "Rio de Camero".
The entire LP was recorded, mixed and mastered within a month, and the band were thrilled with the results. The choice of the first single was, "Because I Love You", a song of love, separation and independence, and became a popular and enduring recording. To promote it, they used Australian film-maker Timothy Fisher to make a music video. The simple but effective clip was filmed on a chilly autumn morning on Hampstead Heath. Black-and-white prints were shown many times on Australian TV, where colour was not introduced until 1975, but it was shot in colour, as were several other clips for tracks from the LP, most were not screened.
The album's cover depicts an elegant, overstuffed chair in a panelled room, with a mysterious disembodied hand holding a cigarette floating above it. It was from the English design group Hipgnosis, who were responsible for covers by Pink Floyd, 10cc and Led Zeppelin. Despite the prospects for their new LP, the band were caught by surprise after its completion when Wheatley revealed they were almost broke. They were determined to stay in London but desperately needed funds. A phone call to EMI Australia for financial assistance proved futile, so they planned an Australian tour. Wheatley headed home to organise it and secured a local soft drink company as a sponsor. The band returned to Australia at the end of December, just as "Because I Love You" was released. It was their fourth consecutive Top 20 hit, reaching No. 12 nationally, and became one of the key songs of the new era of Australian rock. The album's title internationally was "Master's Apprentices", however since their debut album already bore that name in Australia, it was re-titled "Choice Cuts". This alternate title only featured on the label the original vinyl record's label, while the front cover still featured the same title and artwork as the self-titled album.
Reception.
Complementary reviews of the album were positive. Melody Maker's Ray Hollingworth praised the album's original sounding material, partially "Because I Love"; "Maybe it's the strong use of acoustic guitar, maybe it's the blowing energetic scores and vocals 'Because I Love You' is one of those splendid shifting things.". However, despite positive reviews, the album failed to make any impact on the UK charts.
In Australia, the lead single "Because I Love You" would reach #12 on the Go-Set National Top 60 Charts. When the album was released in Australia in April 1971 as "Choice Cuts", initial sales were slow. Eventually, by July, the album would climb to #11 on the Go-Set Top 20 Albums Charts.

Rocca delle Caminate

Rocca delle Caminate is a medieval castle located around from Predappio in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. It functioned as the summer home of Benito Mussolini, who was born in Predappio.
History.
The "Rocca delle Caminate" was built in the 10th century, most likely on the site of a Roman fort.
In 1927, the castle was donated to Benito Mussolini. It was then renovated by interior designer Guido Malagola Cappi. The external renovations included the addition of a lighthouse, which shone a powerful light whenever the Italian leader was present.
It became Mussolini's summer residence in the area and he held meetings with dignitaries during World War II, such as Romanian Foreign Minister Mihai Antonescu, while staying there. The castle was also used as a site of torture, with members of the Italian resistance movement being beaten or killed there. At the end of the war, it was partly destroyed by Allied troops in search of treasure, with the rest of the furniture being removed by locals.
Following the war and Mussolini's death, his widow Rachele made efforts to sell the castle.
21st century.
Calls have been made for the castle's lighthouse to be restored to attract visitors, and Meldola mayor Gian Luca Zattini suggested parts of the castle be converted into a restaurant. The project was approved by the local government in 2017, but some critics suggested it could become a pilgrimage point for modern Fascists and seen as a celebration of Mussolini.

Francois Hennequin

 Francois Hennequin, was a mercenary captain during the Hundred Years War.
Career.
Frank Hennequin was of German origin.
He was garrisoned at Carhaix on behalf of John of Montfort.
There is a story that Saint Charles cured him at Guingamp of general paralysis and so Hennequin in recognition of this miracle performed a barefoot pilgrimage to the church of the Friars Minor in Guingamp. However, while there he got into a duel when someone at the Guingamp denied the sanctity of St Charles.
After the Treaty of Brétigny in the Hundred Years War, Hennequin and his men found themselves unemployed and so become one of the 30 so-called Tard-Venus bandits, that ranged the French country side pillaging town. Leading to Avignon, Pope Innocent VI preaching a "crusade against the robbers".
His story is mentioned in the Chronicles of Froissart which told: "Guin de Batefol: he had on his way well two thousand combatants... these Companies advised, about mid-Lent, that they were trailing towards Avignon and would go to see the pope and the cardinals: if they passed and entered and ran in the county of Mâoon; and they came to the county of Forez for this good country and to Lyon on the Rhone. 
In mid-Lent 1362 his group, in company with up to 2000 other Tard-Venus troops turned towards the rich papal, but largely undefended city of Avignon attacking the county of Macon, Lyon and Forez on the way. They eventually occupy the priory of Estivareilles and put to looting the district. Seguin Badefol took hostages for ransom in Macon County.
Then mid year Francois Hennequin, Naudon de Bageran, Espiote, Creswey, Robert Briquet, and Camus bour, separated from the main group and marched on Avignon to make ransom of the Pope and cardinals.
But on 3 June 1362, this army was cut to pieces by 400 Spaniards and Castilians soldiers under the orders of Henry of Trastamara (King of Castile and Leon) at Montpensier.

FS Class E.421

The FS Class E.421 locomotive of the Italian State Railways (FS) was a battery electric locomotive, built as a single unit (E.421.1) and used for shunting at the old Milan Central railway station. It was the only battery electric locomotive to be registered in the FS fleet.
History.
The E.421 locomotive was built by in 1921, with electrical equipment by Tecnomasio Italiano Brown Boveri (TIBB). The batteries were built by Società Generale Italiana Accumulatori. The batteries were housed in the two bonnets. They weighed 30 tons and supplied electric power at a voltage of 450 V, which operated the four traction motors, one for each axle. The E.421 was used for shunting at the old central station of Milan, particularly in the western area, terminus of the Varese railway, which was electrified with a third rail. It was withdrawn from the service after only two years, in 1923, owing to its onerous maintenance requirements and short operating period - about one hour between charges.
It was stored for a few years, and there was a proposal to convert it to third rail operation, but this was not implemented. The E.421 was scrapped around 1935.

Treaty of Livadia

The Treaty of Livadia () was an unequal treaty between the Russian Empire and the Chinese Qing dynasty signed in Livadiya, Crimea, on 2 October 1879, wherein Russia agreed to return a portion of the lands it had occupied in Xinjiang during the Dungan Revolt of 1862–1877. Even though Qing forces had reconquered the area, the resulting treaty was extremely unfavorable to China. As a result, the Qing government refused to ratify it and the emissary who made the negotiations was sentenced to death (although the sentence was not carried out). Seventeen months later, the two nations signed the Treaty of Saint Petersburg, which apart from territorial matters, largely had the same terms as the Treaty of Livadia.
Background.
The Qing dynasty under the Qianlong Emperor conquered Xinjiang from the Dzungar Khanate in the late 1750s. However, Qing China declined in the late 19th century following the First Opium War. A major revolt known as the Dungan Revolt occurred in the 1860s and 1870s in Northwest China, and Qing rule almost collapsed in all of Xinjiang except for places such as Tacheng. Taking advantage of this revolt, Yakub Beg, commander-in-chief of the army of Kokand occupied most of Xinjiang and declared himself the Emir of Kashgaria.
Russia was officially neutral during the conflict, but as a result of the Treaty of Tarbagatai in 1864, had already gained about of territory in Xinjiang. Furthermore, the Russian Governor-General of Turkestan had sent troops into the Ili Valley in 1871, ostensibly to protect his citizens during the rebellion, but they had extensively built up infrastructure in the Ili capital of Ghulja. This was typical of the Russian strategy of taking control over a region and negotiating recognition of its sovereignty after the fact.
The Qing counterinsurgency, led by General Zuo Zongtang began in September 1876 and concluded in December 1877, having completely retaken the lands that were lost. During this time, Russia had promised to return all occupied lands to China.
Terms of the treaty.
The Treaty of Livadia actually consisted of two separate agreements.
Border treaty.
The first treaty consisted of eighteen articles, and stipulated that:
Commercial treaty.
The second treaty contained seventeen articles that focused on the logistics of conducting trade, such as tax issues, passport requirements, and certification procedures, the total effect of which was very preferential to Russian commercial interests and represented unprecedented access to the Chinese interior. There was also an unrelated supplementary article that reaffirmed Russia's right to navigate the Songhua River as far as Tongjiang in Manchuria.
Uproar in China.
At the time of negotiations, China was in a strong position. Zuo's army was still in the region and far outnumbered the Russian troops that remained. Furthermore, Russia had recently concluded the Russo-Turkish War and the resulting Treaty of Berlin had not been particularly favorable to them. Military expenditures during that war had also drained the national treasury, so the fact that the terms of Livadia were so heavily in their favor came as quite a shock among government officials when they became widely known.
The Qing court laid the blame on the chief negotiator, Chonghou, who was described as being inexperienced and over-eager to return home. Upon his return to Beijing in January 1880, he was denounced as a traitor, stripped of his rank and office, and imprisoned. The government decided it needed to save face and following the Chinese proverb "kill the chicken to scare the monkey", ordered his execution. Zhang Zhidong stated that "The Russians must be considered extremely covetous and truculent in making the demands and Chonghou was extremely stupid and absurd in accepting them ... If we insist on changing the treaty, there may not be trouble; if we do not, we are unworthy to be called a state." Additionally, the government declared it would refuse to ratify the treaty and pressed Russia to reopen negotiations. Naturally, Russia wanted to keep the treaty terms, but their only options were to risk another war in Xinjiang, which they were ill-prepared to fight, or agree to China's request. Russia understood that the Great Powers would not ignore an attempt to enforce an unratified treaty and had even kept the conditions a secret, fearing that European powers would intervene on China's behalf if the terms became known. Given their financial situation and the fact that Ili was not crucial to Russian security, they agreed to discuss a new treaty, but on one condition: that Chonghou was pardoned and his life was spared.
As the months passed, tensions between the two countries remained high and both sides prepared for war. China dispatched Zeng Jize as their new negotiator. The foreign emissaries in Beijing pleaded on behalf of Chonghou, and even Queen Victoria personally interceded. Finally, on 12 August 1880, it was announced that Chonghou would be freed, and negotiations resumed. The resulting Treaty of Saint Petersburg kept many of the same provisions as the Treaty of Livadia, with the major exceptions being that Russia would return almost all of Xinjiang, less a small area reserved for Dungans who wanted to become Russian citizens, and that the amount of the indemnity payment increased.
Analysis.
For many years, the story that Chonghou was solely responsible for the debacle was perpetuated by the Chinese government, and this was the view put forth by historians as well. Although Chonghou had survived, he was turned into a nonperson by the government; he was expunged from government records and his letters were not published posthumously, as was the custom for Chinese court officials. Furthermore, neither the Chinese nor Russian governments retained any documents from the negotiations, thus making it difficult to determine how China ended up with an unequal treaty despite being in the better negotiating position.
Historian S. C. M. Paine investigated the circumstances around the treaty and discovered that contrary to the official story, Chonghou was an experienced diplomat and had a career of over thirty years in negotiations with France, England, and the United States. In fact, he led the delegation to France to offer the Chinese apology after the Tianjin Massacre in 1870.
Instead, Paine believes blame should be laid on the Qing government as a whole. At the Zongli Yamen (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), Prince Gong, who had founded the ministry, had plenty of experience dealing with Russia during negotiations for the Convention of Peking in 1860, and during the Russian occupation period, there was plenty of communication between the two countries that Russian territorial and commercial demands should have been known long before negotiations started. However, despite its charter, the Zongli Yamen was not the only agency that dealt with foreign affairs. Even within the ministry, there was a split between those who were open to foreigners (such as Prince Gong) and those were not.
Paine argues that given Chonghou's experience, because the terms were so unfavorable to China, it is unlikely that he would have made those concessions on his own, as evidenced from the subsequent outrage. It was only when Empress Dowager Cixi sought comment on the treaty from others that it turned into a scandal. Cixi's installation of her nephew as emperor also created a power struggle in the government between her and Prince Gong, whose son was also in contention to succeed the Tongzhi Emperor. Thus, Prince Gong may have been distracted and unable to apply his foreign affairs expertise. In addition, Wenxiang, another diplomat who was also experienced in negotiating with Westerners, had died in 1876.
In short, Paine believes that Chonghou was poorly advised by the Zongli Yamen and when the court became outraged by the treaty, he became the scapegoat, otherwise the ministry and by extension Manchus (who made up the majority of Zongli Yamen officials) would have to take the blame.

John Watchorn

John Watchorn (1826 – 4 March 1905) was an Australian politician. He was a member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council from 1882 until his death in 1905 and was Mayor of Hobart in 1890 and from 1894 to 1896.
Watchorn was born in Nottingham, England in 1826. He migrated to Tasmania with his family in 1837. He was a publican and wine merchant outside of politics. He was a City of Hobart councillor from 1876 to 1896 and mayor in 1890 and from 1894 to 1896. He also served as a magistrate and as a member of the Metropolitan Drainage Board.
Watchorn was declared elected unopposed to the Legislative Council in June 1881, filling a vacancy in the Huon electorate caused by the invalidation of Joseph Solomon's 1880 election. However, his election was challenged by petition, and in August 1881 the Elections and Qualifications Committee of the Legislative Council unseated Watchorn and declared William Fisher, Solomon's 1880 challenger, to have been elected. Fisher died on 3 April 1882, and Watchorn won the resulting May 1882 by-election comfortably. He was re-elected numerous times and served in the Legislative Council until his death in 1905.
He died in office in March 1905 and was buried at Cornelian Bay Cemetery.
Watchorn married Dorcas Anne Blakey (née Collins) on 15 August 1854. She predeceased him, and they had ten children.

Jennifer Jones (Rockette)

Jennifer Jones (born August 1, 1967) is an American dancer and actress. In 1987, she became the first African American Radio City Music Hall Rockette.
Life and education.
Jones was born on August 1, 1967, in Newark, New Jersey and was raised in Randolph, where she attended Randolph High School and County College of Morris.
Radio City Music Hall Rockettes.
In 1987, when she was 20 years old, Jones auditioned to be a Radio City Music Hall Rockette at a Rockettes Open Call. She made the cut and became the dance company's first African American Rockette in its then-62-year history. She was chosen out of 221 women who had auditioned for the 26 open spots on the coveted line. Out of the 23 other women who were contracted for on-call vacancies in the New York City production, she was the only African American.
At , she fulfilled the RCMH requirement that its Rockette dancers must be between 5-foot-6 and 5-foot-10 ½ in stocking feet, as well as being proficient in ballet, tap, and jazz repertory. Other requirements, according to "The New York Times", included, “a slender figure, long legs, and the ability to perform 20 eye-level kicks while retaining proper posture.”
She had a fifteen-year career with the RCMH Rockettes, which included a national tour and televised performances such as "Comic Relief IV", an HBO TV special from May 12, 1990, filmed at Radio City Music Hall, which featured Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg, and Robin Williams with the RCMH Rockettes.
In 2002, she retired and joined the Rockette Alumnae Association.
Color barrier.
Jones crossing the color barrier in 1987 ended a longstanding Radio City Music Hall policy against hiring African Americans for its Rockettes’ chorus line so as not to distract from its hallmark of perfectly-synchronized precision and rigid color uniformity. The rule was set-down in 1925 by Russell E. Markert when he founded the Rockettes dance company in St. Louis with its chorus line modeled on the precision dance style inspired by early 20th century dance troupes such as the Ziegfeld Follies and the Folies Bergère.
As its chief choreographer, Markert sought absolute precision and uniformity in the movements of the dancers through syncopated, intricate steps based on soft-shoe and tap. Every dancer was required to move as one unit. Markert also forbade his dancers from sun-tanning, explaining that, “it would make her [the dancer] look like a colored girl."
Markert's guidelines extended well into the 20th century. In 1982, its director and choreographer, Violet Holmes, defended the RCMH Rockettes’ lack of diversity on artistic grounds when questioned by "The New York Times" on why no African American dancer had ever been chosen for the line. Holmes explained that the Rockettes had a rich history as a precision line, and its girls needed to act as mirror images on the stage. She continued, “One or two black girls in the line would definitely distract. You would lose the look of precision, which is the hallmark of the Rockettes.”
The company faced backlash from civil rights organizations such as the NAACP and the City Council's Black and Hispanic Caucus for its lack of diversity, particularly noticeable against New York City's multicultural landscape. The chairwoman of the New York City Human Rights, Marcella Maxwell, opined that the Rockettes were not fully reflecting the richness of New York City's diverse racial and ethnic populations, but underlined that no discrimination complaints had been filed against the company for its longstanding policy.
Radio City Music Hall countered the criticism, stating that the lack of diversity was based on the infrequency and rarity of Rockettes' job openings, and that when auditions were advertised, they specifically placed ads in black, Hispanic, and Asian publications to encourage minority dancers to audition.
National debut.
Jones’ national debut with the RCMH Rockettes was on Sunday, January 31, 1988 during the National Football League Super Bowl XXII halftime show at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, in a game between the Washington Redskins and the Denver Broncos.
Produced by Radio City Music Hall, the theme was "Something Grand", and was intended to break from the "traditional baton-twirling approach" of past halftime shows, as explained by Barnett Lipton, Radio City Music Hall's special events coordinator. He added that the theme was a spinoff of the year 1988. “We've come up with a show that's all 88 – 88 pianos, each with 88 keys, and the 88 greatest legs in show business.”
The 12-minute spectacle showcased 1,200 performers, which included 44 Rockettes, 400 swing band members, 300 Jazzercisers, 88 tuxedoed pianists simultaneously playing on 88 Kimball grand pianos, and two college marching bands (San Diego State and USC). R&amp;B singer Chubby Checker sang his hit song, “The Twist.” The pianists performed an adapted version of Edvard Grieg's Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 16, accompanied by the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes.
Awards and recognition.
Tony Award.
During Jones’ penultimate year rostering with the RCMH Rockettes, she performed in the ensemble of the 2001 Broadway revival of "42nd Street", which won the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical that year. She was one of three African American women to be cast in the show.
The Harlem City Music Hall Dance Spectacular.
In 2016, Jones was honored by The Harlem School of the Arts with a world premiere tribute called “The Harlem City Music Hall Dance Spectacular”, written and directed by Aubrey Lynch II, the school's dance director. The show was inspired by Jones’ RCMH Rockettes legacy and barrier-breaking milestone, and featured The Harlemettes, The Harlem Rockets, and the Harlem School of the Arts Dance students. The story followed Little JJ on her quest to becoming a Rockette, an aspirational allegory of how dreams can be realized through determination, courage, hard work, and talent. At the event, Jones acknowledged that by crossing the color barrier with the RCMH Rockettes, she had paved the way for the next generation of trailblazers.
"O Mag" Insider appointment.
In August 2018, Jones was appointed an "O Mag Insider" by "O, The Oprah Magazine."
Personal life.
Jones has been a resident of West Orange, New Jersey.

Nestor Mesta Chayres

Néstor Mesta Cháyres (aka Nestor Chaires, Ciudad Lerdo, February 26, 1908 - Mexico City, June 29, 1971) was an acclaimed tenor in Mexico and a noted interpreter of Spanish songs, boleros and Mexican romantic music on the international concert stage. He was widely commended for his artistic renditions of the works of Agustín Lara and María Grever and was nicknamed "El Gitano de México".
Biography.
Néstor Mesta Cháyres was born to Florentino Mesta and Juana Cháyres in a family which included six additional children: Juanita, María Luisa, Herminia, Óscar, Jesús and Margarita in the city of Lerdo, Mexico. His initial studies in music were provided by a local teacher and an organist at the parish church. Even as a child he showed promise as an operatic singer. In his youth, he was also known to sing to a recording of "Caro Nome" from Giuseppe Verdi's opera "Rigoletto". While still in high school, he exhibited an exceptional vocal aptitude which earned him several awards. After the death of his father in 1925, he earned a scholarship to the National Conservatory of Music in Mexico City. His studies included instructions in music theory, harmony, counterpoint, and voice with Lambert Castañeros - who had performed at La Scala in Milan, Italy.
Néstor's professional career began in the artistic center of the Mexican capital in 1929 performing songs of Jorge del Moral and Agustín Lara at the Bolivár Amphitheater at the National Preparatory School. Soon he achieved success on the radio station X.E.B. in Mexico City, where he continued to perform for four years. By 1933 he launched a concert tour with the pianist Jorge del Moral to Havana, Cuba where he performed the waltz "Divina Mujer" at various theaters. He also appeared in three gala concerts for the President of the Republic during his two-month tour on the island. After returning to Mexico City in 1934, he also recorded several songs including "Morena" (Jorge del Moral).
By the early 1940s, Cháyres had achieved extensive notoriety throughout Mexico. He soon collaborated with the Sypmphony Orchestra of Mexico in a concert at the prestigious Palace of Fine Arts in Mexico City in 1943. This set the stage for Néstor's debut in New York City on the radio for WABC under the direction of Andre Kostelanetz and a subsequent concert with the Philadelphia Orchestra. As a distinguished opera vocalist, Chayres was also invited by the CBS network to collaborate with the contralto Tona la Negra and Andre Kostelanetz conducting the Mexican Symphony Orchestra in a special Easter Sunday broadcast as supervised by the OIAA (Office of Inter-American Affairs) of the United States Department of State. In the early 1940s he also concertized regularly at the Havana Madrid night club in New York to the acclaim of critics.
Cháyres joined the staff at the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS Radio) in 1943 under the musical direction of Alfredo Antonini as a featured soloist on the radio program "Viva América" while collaborating with the accordionist John Serry Sr. He continued to collaborate with Antonini on additional live radio broadcasts for Voice of America and the Department of State's Office of International Broadcasting and Cultural Affairs in subsequent years. These performances were also broadcast overseas for the benefit of the members of America's armed forces personnel during World War II In addition, they helped to introduce Latin American music and the Mexican bolero to large audiences throughout the United States during the 1940s. Several recordings of boleros were also produced in collaboration with Antonini and his orchestra during this time on Decca Records including: "Noche de Ronda" (23770 B) and "Granada" (23770 A). His recordings in both North and South America for RCA Victor from this period featured collaborations with the Orquesta Radio Caracas and the Orquesta Gonzalo Cervera. They included: "Princesita" ( # 90-0595-A), "Todo Mi Ser" (# 90-0595-B), "Manolete" (# 23-0853-A) and "Silverio" (#20-0853-B).
 Néstor also performed regularly on the NBC radio network during this time. He first concertized at the historic Town Hall in New York City in 1945 and returned for a repeat performance three years later. Subsequently, he collaborated once again with Alfredo Antonini conducting the New York Philharmonic for a gala "Night of the Americas" concert at Carnegie Hall in 1946.
Based upon these achievements, an extensive array of international concerts emerged which included an appearance with the Montreal Philharmonic Orchestra in Canada in 1946. While concertizing in South America he performed in Peru, Columbia, Venezuela, Chile and Argentina. He also returned to Mexico to perform for President Miguel Alemán Valdés in 1947. In 1949 he joined forces with the Chicago Opera House and concertized throughout Europe in France, Sweden, Holland, Norway, Denmark, England and Spain. During this time Chayres was represented by the prestigious impresario Sol Hurok In Madrid, he performed the "Seven Songs" of Manuel de Falla to great acclaim. His final tour in the United States and Canada was completed in 1950. Upon returning to Mexico City, he married his wife Peggy Satanon who "discovered" Cháyres during a recital at the Palace of Fine Arts.
In 1951, Néstor's artistic career was interrupted by the tragic death of his mother in an automobile accident. Cháyres suspended his concert appearances for over ten years but did appear in the movie "Cuando me vaya" in 1954 in collaboration with the such as actors as Libertad Lamarque, Miguel Torruco, Julián de Meriche and fellow vocalists Juan Arvizu and Alfonso Ortiz Tirado. This film biography of the Mexican songwriter María Grever earned two Ariel Awards in Mexico in 1955. He returned to television in 1968 for an appearance in the "Paco Malgesto Hour" and in 1969 on "The Golden Hour of the W". His final appearance on television occurred in 1970 on the show "24 Hours".
Performance style.
During the course of his professional career, critics in "Billboard" magazine applauded Néstor Mesta Cháyres for a powerful, exciting and dramatic delivery which pleased his audiences. He was also commended for the warmth and tenderness of his renditions. Critics also took note of his fine and full tenor voice and his capacity to interpret Mexican-gypsy folk melodies with fire and passion. His powerful voice and expansive vocal range could even be heard outside the theater and often moved his audiences to tears. 
Néstor Mesta Cháyres' artistic interpretations of such songs as "Murcia", "Toledo", "Clavel Sevilliano", "Granda" and the "Suite Español" by Agustín Lara earned him the beloved title - "El Gitano de Mexico" ("The Gyspy of Mexico"). He was often compared favorably to the outstanding lyric tenors of his time including: Juan Arvizu, Luise G. Roldán and Alfonso Ortiz Tirado and Tito Schipa.
Death.
Néstor Mesta Cháyres passed away during 1971 in Mexico City after suffering a heart attack at the age of 63. His musical legacy includes an extensive collection of recordings of the works of Agustín Lara and María Grever.

Charles Folsom

Charles Folsom (December 24, 1794 – November 8, 1872) was a classical scholar, librarian, and editor. He was librarian at Harvard College from 1823 to 1826.
Folsom, born in Exeter, N. H., 24 December 1794, was the son of James and Sarah (Gilman) Folsom. After studying at Phillips Academy, Exeter, he entered Harvard in the sophomore class and graduated in 1813. During the winter vacations while an undergraduate and for the year after his graduation, he taught school. Returning to Cambridge the next year, he began to prepare himself for the ministry, but poor health forced him to give it up. Meanwhile, he was a proctor and regent in the college, and in 1816 received the degree of A.M. The same year he accepted an appointment as chaplain and instructor of mathematics on the U. S. ship "Washington" about to cruise in the Mediterranean. He remained abroad five years, part of the time serving as United States consul at Tunis (1817–19).
In 1821, he returned to Harvard and was chosen tutor in Latin, a position he kept until in September, 1823, he was made Librarian. By the direction of the Harvard Corporation he issued in 1824 a printed list of duplicates which were offered for sale at fixed prices. It was during his administration that greater freedom in the use of the Library began to be granted, especially to visiting scholars; and it was largely at his suggestion that the Library was thrown open "to all comers, with the implied assurance of welcome and aid." In 1826, he resigned the office and also the tutorship of Italian he had held for a year, in order to give his full-time to a position he had partly filled for a year or two, namely, corrector of the Harvard University Press. Yet his interest in the Library did not cease, for we find him apparently still in charge (in March, 1828) of the sale of duplicates as begun during his term, and he gave Benjamin Peirce able assistance in the preparation of the catalogue of 1830. The Greek motto prefixed to the catalogue of maps was suggested by him.
Writing but little himself, it was in such ways as this, giving unstintingly his own time and labor and accurate scholarship to the correction and revision of the work of others, that Charles Folsom exercised a decided influence in the world of letters. Sparks, Prescott, Quincy, and many other prominent authors were glad to acknowledge his skill and ever willing assistance. And so on the books which passed through his hands at the Press, it is said that his "passion for exact and minute accuracy," often led him to spend more time than had the authors themselves. Indeed, the pains he took in the verification of even the slightest details consumed so much time that he was finally obliged to resign his position, the press could not wait for him. In 1821, he had edited with William Cullen Bryant, the "United States Literary Gazette", and ten years later he joined Professor Andrews Norton (Librarian, 1813–21) in editing the four volumes of the "Select Journal of Foreign Periodical Literature". His only publications apart from those in periodicals were school editions of Livy and Cicero. He was frequently asked to write inscriptions, a species of composition for which he had great talent ; those on the monuments to Presidents Dunster, Willard, and Webber in the Cambridge burying ground are from his pen.
Folsom was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, of the American Antiquarian Society, and of the Massachusetts Historical Society, and contributed a number of papers to their publications.
In 1841, moving to Boston, Folsom opened a school for young ladies. But at the end of four years he was elected Librarian of the Boston Athenaeum, then just entering its new building and widely extending its influence. Shortly before accepting this office he wrote to his friend S. A. Eliot a long letter giving his views, which were singularly advanced for the times, on libraries and librarians; "A letter," says Dr. Peabody, "which can hardly be transcended in simplicity, purity, and elegance of diction." Leaving the Athenaeum after a faithful and useful service of nearly eleven years, he returned to Cambridge to spend the remaining years of his life. He died, 8 November 1872, in his seventy-eighth year.
Charles Folsom married, 19 October 1824, Susanna Sarah, daughter of Rev. Joseph McKean, Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory. He had four children.

Regio 2N

The Regio 2N is family of a double-deck, dual-voltage electric multiple unit trainsets built for French rail operator SNCF to serve its regional rail routes (TER, Transilien, and RER).
The trains utilize a unique and highly configurable design. One of the end cars is single-deck and designed to accommodate wheelchair users, the other end car is double-deck. The intermediate cars are either double-deck with no doors accommodating seated passengers traveling long distances or single-deck with two double doors per side accommodating standing passengers traveling short distances. Trains can be configured with six, seven, eight or ten cars. Additionally, the seating can be configured for intercity service (2+1 seating in 1st class, 2+2 seating in 2nd class), regional service (2+2 seating throughout), or high-capacity commuter service (3+2 seating throughout).
A total of 447 trainsets have either been built or are under construction by Canadian conglomerate Bombardier at its Crespin, France factory since 2012. The first set was placed into regular passenger service in September 2013.
The name Regio 2N is a sensational spelling of the word "region" (in reference to the regional rail routes these trains serve) including SNCF's designation for double-deck rolling stock: 2N (French: "2 Niveaux", English: "two-level"). The manufacturer brands this equipment as the Bombardier Omneo and SNCF classes it as Z 55500, Z 56300, Z 56500, Z 56600 or Z 57000 depending on the configuration.
History.
The Omneo had been designed by Bombardier's facility at Crespin in response to a request issued by SNCF, which had sought to equip itself with a new generation of regional EMUs. Between 2002 and 2009, SNCF had experienced a 40% increase in passengers on its TER regional services, averaging around 800 000 passengers per day, and further growth in demand had been forecast over the following decades; the procurement of new trainsets was financed primarily by various regional authorities rather than SNCF itself. Following the receipt of several bids, during November 2009, an SNCF spokesperson stated that Bombardier was the preferred bidder at that stage. On 24 February 2010, Bombardier announced that it had been awarded a firm order for 80 trainsets. The contract, which included additional options for up to 860 total trainsets worth a total of €8 billion, called for deliveries of the initial batch to occur between June 2013 and December 2015.
In February 2012, static testing of an early trainset commenced; by September of that year, testing had proceeded to the trial running phase, which was conducted at the Velim railway test circuit. Between September 2012 and September 2013, the test fleet of nine pre-series trainsets accumulated 100,000km of single-unit operations and 20,000km of multiple-unit operations. In September 2013, a ceremony was held at the Crespin manufacturing plant, where Bombardier build the Omneo, at which the first trainset was delivered to SNCF; it was attended by company president Guillaume Pepy and various representatives of the regions that had funded the order—by that time expanded to 129 trainsets—ahead of delivery and testing across SNCF's own network. At the time, Bombardier stated that the test programme was 90% completed, the remainder largely focusing upon electromagnetic compatibility, air conditioning, and general multiple-unit operations; production was also ramping up from one trainset per month to three per month by January 2014.
In January 2014, SNCF exercised its option to procure a further 30 trainsets; these were followed by eight more Omneos during October 2015. In February 2016, four additional trainsets were opted for, resulting in a total of 213 trainsets being on order at this point. In November 2016, SNCF ordered 40 trainsets in the Premium configuration, this batch being the first to be equipped as such, featuring improved onboard amenities and a higher top speed; by August 2018, dynamic testing of the first Omneo Premium trainset was underway. By February 2018, a total of 382 trainsets had been ordered. In November 2018, 19 Premium trainsets were ordered for service from Paris to Hauts-de-France points. The Omneo is set to replace various older trainsets, including the Z2N, V2N, Vo-VR2N, RRR-Rio and Corail trains for both regional and intercity services across the French Regions.
Design.
The Bombardier Omneo is a double-deck electric multiple units (EMU). It features a modular design approach, allowing the trainset to be readily adapted for suburban, regional and intercity traffic. According to Bombardier, it is the world's first double-deck EMU to be articulated. Each trainset comprises both single level and double level cars; propulsion equipment, such as the braking resistors and electrical transformers, are installed on the roofs of the single level cars; the double level cars are dedicated to passenger seating alone. The Omneo typically comprises between six and ten individual cars in each trainset, giving a total length of between and and a width of and for twin and single level cars respectively. Dependent upon both length and seating configuration, a trainset can have a maximum passenger capacity of up to 1,380 people, being able to seat 780 of these. Individual cars of a trainset can be exchanged to change the ratio of double-deck to single-deck cars as to better suit a particular service.
The interior configuration is reconfigurable, allowing it to be adapted to suit the trainset's intended use and customer specifications. It has been anticipated that a common intercity configuration would feature a 2+1 seating configuration, dedicated luggage spaces, increased toilet capacity, greater seat pitch, individual reading lights and electric sockets, and footrests for greater comfort. The double level cars lack doors, as well as several common conveniences such as toilets and spaces for bicycles and wheelchairs, these can only be found within the single level cars. For passenger safety, an onboard CCTV system is also installed through the cars. The gangways between cars are also double level as to maximise passenger's accessibility and movement; the cars are wider than those of most conventional trains. The "Premium" variant of the Omneo features various improvements in passenger amenities over the "Base" model, these include spacious reclining seats with individual armrests, wider doors and a more luxurious interior.
Omneo trainsets can be specified with a or a top speed, these being available as the "Base" and "Premium" configurations respectively. SNCF classifies the base version as "Z 55500" and the Premium as "Z 56500". Omneo trainsets have a base power output of with three powered bogies; the customer can specify a fourth powered bogie for an output of . The trainsets are powered by 1.5 kV or 25 kV AC catenary. The trainsets are composed of relatively lightweight materials, which minimises axle loads; the Omneo is claimed by Bombardier to be 95% recyclable. It was designed to minimise both noise and vibration levels. The Omneo incorporates Bombardier's ECO4 technologies, comprising the four cornerstones of energy, efficiency, economy and ecology; examples include a permanent magnet motor (PMM), a thermo-efficient climate control system, aero-efficient exterior shaping, and an energy management control system, which reportedly reduce both energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Due to its high level of French-sourced content, the Omneo has received a "Guaranteed French Origin" label, the first to be granted within the rail industry.

Dopapod

Dopapod is an American rock band from Boston, Massachusetts. The current lineup includes keyboardist/vocalist Eli Winderman, guitarist/vocalist Rob Compa, bassist Chuck Jones, drummer Neal “Fro” Evans, and lighting director Luke Stratton. Although classified as a jam band, Dopapod incorporates bits of funk, heavy metal, jazz fusion, and country. They have self-released five studio albums, and spend most of their time touring.
History.
Early Years.
Dopapod was formed at Boston's Berklee College of Music in 2008, as a duo with Eli Winderman and drummer Michelangelo Carubba. They performed in this format around New England for a year or so before adding Rob Compa on guitar another Berklee student. After a year as a trio, they added Chuck Jones on bass—who at the time had another band and with Winderman called The Actual Proof—and Neal Evans on percussion. In 2010, Carubba became the full-time drummer for Turkuaz and Evans took over drums for Dopapod. The band split with Evans in 2013, and he was replaced by Scotty Zwang until Evans returned in 2016.
Touring.
After releasing their debut album, "Radar" in 2009, Dopapod began touring the next year on their own and on bills with other artists. The band appeared on the 2015 Bonnaroo lineup and was cited by "Rolling Stone" as Bonnaroo's “Best-Kept Secret” comparing them to Phish, Disco Biscuits and Frank Zappa.
Other dates included opening for String Cheese Incident in Red Rocks, Colorado in 2015; joining Ween, Greyboy Allstars, The Nth Power with Trey Anastasio Band horns and more in 2017 at California's High Sierra Music Festival; as well as performing on the Jam Cruise 15 to Jamaica with Widespread Panic, Ivan Neville, Percy Hall, among others.
The band's 2017 tour included multi-night dates in the same city, explained by the "Boston Globe" as giving “the group a more open hand to improvise, aware that its jam-hungry fans are seeking a unique live experience each night.”
Recordings.
Since its inception, Dopapod has released five studio albums, all of which have titles that are palindromes. The first two projects, "Radar" in 2009 and "Drawn Onward" in 2011 were instrumentals. "Redivider," which was released in 2012, was the first recording to feature vocals by Compa and Winderman, and the band also sang on 2014's "Never Odd or Even."
Dopapod makes recordings of their live shows available on its website, including "I Saw Live Dopapod Evil Was I" out in 2011, an "II Saw Live Dopapod Evil Was II" from 2017.
In 2016, the band were at Mountain Star Studios, Black Hawk, Colorado, in the middle of winter to record a new album, "MEGAGEM". The album was released October 2017. “A lot of the new songs infuse hip-hop beats with the progressive rock sound we’ve been experimenting with for the last few years. It feels like uncharted territory, at least for us,” explained Winderman in "Mountain Xpress" newspaper.
Dopapod finished 2017 with a national tour, and are taking a year off to spend time with family and friends and work on new material.

Blair St. Clair

Andrew Bryson (born May 16, 1995), better known by the stage name Blair St. Clair, is an American drag queen, singer, and hair stylist, known for competing on the tenth season of the reality competition series "RuPaul's Drag Race", as well as the fifth season of "RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars".
Early life.
St. Clair was born in Indiana on May 16, 1995. She attended Perry Meridian High School in Indianapolis where she participated in theater.
Career.
St. Clair first rose to prominence when she won the title of Miss Gay Indiana in 2016. She was revealed as one of fourteen contestants on the tenth season of "RuPaul's Drag Race" before the official cast was announced due to getting arrested for a DUI violation. She is the first contestant from Indiana to compete on the show. She was the sixth contestant eliminated on a lipsync to Diana Ross' "I'm Coming Out", losing to The Vixen, and placing ninth.
St. Clair's grand finale dress was designed by "Project Runway" alumnus Mondo Guerra. After the show, she walked for Guerra's collection at FashioNXT in October 2018.
Music.
One day after her elimination episode, St. Clair released her debut single, "Now or Never", on April 27, 2018. The song's music video features Jinkx Monsoon, Manila Luzon, and Max Emerson.
St. Clair released a follow-up single, "Call My Life", with a music video on June 26, 2018. Her seven-track debut album of the same name was released three days later. "Drag Race" alumna Alaska is featured on the album's sixth track, "America's Sweetheart". The album peaked at number one of the "Billboard" Dance/Electronic Sales Chart. A remix EP of the "Call My Life" single was released on August 10, 2018. It features Dave Audé, Chris Cox, DrewG., Hector Fonseca, Zambianco and Ralphi Rosario.

On April 30, 2020 Blair released her single "Empty", followed by "9 Lives" and six promotional singles from her second studio album "Identity", released on July 21, 2020.
Hair by Blair.
In late 2019, St. Clair launched Hair by Blair with the intent to sell lace front and full lace wigs online; and, shortly after moving back to Indianapolis, St. Clair opened a full-service salon under the same name to take in clients.
Personal life.
The first part of St. Clair's drag name came from the character Blair in "Gossip Girl" while the second part was suggested by her mother after she had passed St. Clair Street in downtown Indianapolis. St. Clair has mentioned using the name Blair and female pronouns in her personal life.
St. Clair was raped at a college party, which she shared on "RuPaul's Drag Race". In 2018, "Drag Race" winner Bianca Del Rio controversially made a joke at one of her comedy sets about St. Clair's decision to bring up the rape on "Drag Race" upon finding out she was up for elimination. Del Rio received backlash from fans and fellow queens including St. Clair herself.

Kameron Michaels

Dane Young (born July 23, 1986), known professionally as Kameron Michaels, is an American drag performer who came to international attention after competing on the tenth season of "RuPaul's Drag Race". Originally from Columbia, Tennessee, she began her career in Nashville, where she performed locally from 2004 or 2005 until her appearance on television. Since her season aired in 2018, Michaels has been a staple of several domestic and international tours that feature "Drag Race" contestants, including Werq the World, Christmas Queens and Drive 'N Drag. She has also appeared on a number of web series produced by World of Wonder. In June 2019, she released "Freedom", her debut single and music video. Since January 2020, she has been a staple cast member of "RuPaul's Drag Race Live!", a residency show in Las Vegas, and also stars in the accompanying VH1 miniseries "".
Michaels identifies as a muscle queen, that is, a drag queen whose aesthetic embraces a built, muscular body. Because of her physique, she is known by the nickname "The Bodybuilder Barbie". She is also noted for her tattoos, which cover her forearms, her chest and part of a leg.
Early life.
Young was born on July 23, 1986, his parents' only child. They lived in Massillon, Ohio, until he was five years old. After this, they briefly resided in Michigan before moving to Columbia, Tennessee, where Young spent the majority of his youth. He realized he was gay in his early teens, and he came out to his mother at age 14. She reacted supportively. 
In high school, he was bullied for his sexuality and body language, and he developed introverted tendencies in response to this. He studied photographs and videos of himself to identify effeminate gestures that he then learned to modify or avoid.
When he was 18, Young began traveling to Nashville on the weekends, and he took up work as a go-go dancer and cocktail server on the local scene. It was there that he first came into contact with drag queens and subsequently began performing in drag. Because he felt more at home in Nashville's queer community than in the conservative environment of Columbia, he relocated to Nashville when he was 21.
Career.
Beginnings and style.
At the start of Young's drag career, a more seasoned performer made his costumes, but he taught himself how to use makeup. He initially took the drag name Arianna St. Claire. After a few months, he switched the name to Kameron Michaels, as he wanted an androgynous first name paired with a last name used by no other drag queen in Nashville.
Young took inspiration for his aesthetic from cinema and video games, and he describes his drag style as hyper-feminine. He credits the Southern variety of drag he learned in Nashville with making him well-rounded, stating that it equipped him with diverse skills such as dancing and costume-making. After developing a gym habit in his mid-20s, he became known as a muscle queen due to his built physique. Before appearing on "RuPaul's Drag Race", Young worked full time as a hair stylist, doing drag only on weekends. He performed regularly at Play Dance Bar in Nashville.
"RuPaul's Drag Race".
Michaels auditioned for the seventh season of "Drag Race" in 2014, but she did not receive a callback. She then auditioned for the tenth season in an effort to overcome a difficult breakup. On her audition tape, she highlighted that, as a muscle queen, she was a type of character the show had never seen before. She was selected to participate, and her season aired in 2018. She finished as a runner-up, together with Eureka O'Hara, behind winner Aquaria.
Some media outlets and fellow contestants dubbed Michaels the season's lip sync assassin, as she lip-synced for her life four times in a row without being sent home; no other contestant has survived more than three lip syncs. She also won the finale's first Lip Sync for the Crown but lost the second one to Aquaria, bringing her lip sync total to six. On the show, she was noted for her introversion, which set her apart from her competitors. Following criticism she received in the season's reunion episode for appearing more extroverted on social media than in person, Michaels learned about ambiversion. She has stated that this description fits her well.
In August 2021, Michaels appeared on the ninth episode of the sixth season of "RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars". Serving as the episode's Lip Sync Assassin, she lip synced against the week's top competitor, Ra'Jah O'Hara, and was declared the winner.
Music and tours.
As part of season 10's final challenge, Michaels and the other top four contestants wrote and recorded their own verses for RuPaul's song "American". The song reached number 12 on the "Billboard" Dance/Electronic Songs chart. In summer 2018, Michaels participated in the 10s Across the Board Tour, traveling around the U.S. with other queens from the season. Later that year, she recorded the track "Let It Snow" on "Christmas Queens 4", a compilation album featuring Christmas songs sung by former "Drag Race" contestants. Following the album's release, she embarked on the Christmas Queens tour of Europe in November and December 2018. She then returned to Europe for a solo tour in January 2019. The following month, she released a lip sync music video in which she performs Mark Ronson's "Nothing Breaks Like a Heart". In June of that year, she released her debut single, "Freedom", and its corresponding music video.
Since the second half of 2018, Michaels has traveled around the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe for several legs of Werq the World, and she appears in a docuseries about that tour. From January 2020, Michaels has been a staple of "RuPaul's Drag Race Live!", a residency show in Las Vegas. The show went on hiatus for much of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Michaels was still on the cast when it resumed in August 2021. She also co-stars in "", a VH1 miniseries about the live show. In May 2020, Michaels participated in a live-streamed version of Werq the World to raise money for drag entertainers out of work due to the pandemic. Since July 2020, Michaels has been on tour with Drive 'N Drag, a drive-in drag show held outdoors to accommodate social distancing restrictions imposed due to COVID-19.
Personal life.
Young is openly gay. He began visiting the gym with a boyfriend who pressured him to stop doing drag. After they broke up, he continued to focus on building muscle and returned to the drag scene, where his body drew criticism from others in the industry. In the months that followed the airing of "Drag Race" season 10, his workout routine temporarily fell by the wayside as he adjusted to life on tour.
Young's arms and hands, as well as his chest, neck and left leg, bear tattoos that are visible when he is both in and out of drag. When asked about them in an interview, he said, "I started getting tattooed when I was around 26 or 27. All my tattoos are by the same artist, and they were all done in about a year and a half. [They depict] favorite movies from my childhood and sentimental things in my life." His left arm contains imagery from "Jurassic Park" and "Aliens", and he has a scarab beetle across his chest. Of the latter, he said, "I got that when I started working out and going to the gym, because the scarab represents kind of a rebirth. That was me finding out who I was meant to be and really doing things for myself... taking time for myself."
In July 2020, Young deleted much of the content from his Kameron Michaels profiles on Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, coincidentally on the day that RuPaul did the same; this generated discussion and speculation among "Drag Race" fans and followers. Young later stated that he had removed the posts during a period of mental distress, which he attributed to prolonged time spent home alone due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to reflection about the ongoing George Floyd protests. He subsequently restored some of the content.
In July 2021, Young shared on social media that he had suffered a severe bout of depression in November 2020, stating: 
, Young resided in Los Angeles. The following month, he purchased a home in Las Vegas and moved there with his French Bulldog, Lilo.

She faced more backlash after quarreling with competitor Eureka O'Hara in multiple episodes, most notably in episode 4 of Untucked.

Leone Giovanni Battista Nigris

Leone Giovanni Battista Nigris (27 August 1884 – 21 September 1964) was an Italian prelate of the Catholic Church who worked in Albania. He became an archbishop in 1938.
Biography.
Leone Giovanni Battista Nigris was born on 27 August 1884 in Ampezzo, Italy. He was ordained a priest on 18 July 1909. He devoted the next twenty years to teaching and education administration.
On 18 August 1938, Pope Pius XI appointed him titular archbishop of Philippi and Apostolic Delegate to Albania.
He received his episcopal consecration on 25 September 1938 from Giuseppe Nogara, Archbishop of Udine.
On 11 November 1939, Pope Pius XII named him Apostolic Administrator of Southern Albania. In this traditional Orthodox rather than Catholic region of Albania he guided Catholic missionaries to a less aggressive approach to conversions, advising the less aggressive approach of persuasion by providing models of virtuous life rather than through argument; he was suspicious of mass conversions. He feared the Italian occupation of Albania in 1939 would harden sectarian divisions.
In 1945 the new Communist government, intent on establishing a national church without ties to Rome, had him arrested an expelled from Albania as "persona non grata".
Returned to Rome, he became secretary of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith.
He died in Rome on 21 September 1964 at the age of 80.

Osseo Water Tower

The Osseo Water Tower in Osseo, Minnesota, is a historic water tower listed on the National Register of Historic Places in June, 2017. It was listed for its historical significance to community planning and development in Osseo, because it promoted better fire fighting, provided fresh water to homes and businesses, and supported the growth of the community. It is also architecturally significant because hemispherical-bottom water towers, built from about the 1890s to about 1940, are rapidly being replaced by larger-capacity towers.
Osseo residents and the Village Council had been discussing the establishment of a water works since about 1900. At that time, fire protection was only available with a bucket brigade, or with hand-pumped wells that each required six men to pump enough water to produce a strong stream. In 1914, the Osseo Commercial Club actively organized to bring water and electrical service to the village. They promoted the significant savings on fire insurance, the decreased risk of property loss, and the fact that water and electric service would bring more businesses to Osseo. The village council heard a petition on December 28, 1914 with a proposal to issue $20,000 in bonds to build a water works plant and an electric plant. The village held an election on January 12, 1915, and both the power plant and water plant propositions passed with a sound majority. On May 4, 1915, the village council received bids for construction, which began around July 21. The village prepared a celebration, the Osseo Light and Water Carnival, which was billed as “The Greatest Municipal Prosperity and Improvement Celebration in the
History of Northern Hennepin County.” The water system was pronounced completed on November 24, 1915. The Commercial Club then spurred the formal creation of the Osseo Fire Department, which further helped reduce fire insurance rates.
During that period, the village was also a hub of potato harvesting from nearby farms. In 1914, an average of 150 train car loads of potatoes were being shipped out each day on the Great Northern Railway. Another development was the establishment of the Jefferson Highway, which came in 1916 and was routed along Central Avenue.
The city of Osseo considered demolishing the water tower in 2014 after learning that repairing it and removing lead paint would cost about $500,000.
Local resident Kathleen Gette spurred an effort to list the water tower on the National Register. Gette sought state funding for the study and the National Register nomination. The Legacy Amendment funds provided $6,500 for the initial study.
 There are only seven remaining municipal water towers with a hemispherical bottom within 50 miles of Osseo: Elk River (whose tower is listed on the National Register), Hampton, Milaca, Robbinsdale, Minnetonka Beach, and Waconia. There had been at least 17 towers of this design within a 50-mile radius, and probably more. Most of those towers are in small communities in outlying areas. The nomination also notes that historic water towers are disappearing because of the expense of maintenance.

"44 More" is a song recorded by American rapper Logic, It was released on February 23, 2018 by Visionary Music Group and Def Jam Recordings. It serves as Logic's first solo single since the release of his third album "Everybody" (2017). The song is a sequel to "44 Bars", a song from Logic's 2016 mixtape "Bobby Tarantino". Lyrically, Logic discusses family issues and his thoughts on his current position in the rap industry, as well as addressing his detractors.
Background and release.
Logic recorded the song in summer 2017 while on tour. He announced the song a day before its release. In the accompanying snippet, Logic speaks to his hater, rapping: "Can't let fame go to your head/ F--- with me watch where you tread/ I'm finna kill it instead". The song features references to singers Katy Perry and Harry Styles. Logic's third studio album "Everybody" outsold Katy Perry's "Witness" and Harry Styles' self-titled solo debut album in its first week in the United States. "Sold more albums my first week than Harry Styles and Katy Perry/If that ain't a sign of the times then I don't know what is, man this sh*t is scary," he raps.
Composition.
"44 More" features exactly 44 bars as well as an 808 beat laced with "skittering" hi-hats and synths, according to "Rolling Stone"s Ryan Reed. The song samples "Zoom" by Future from the album "Future" (2017).
Critical reception.
Aron A. of HotNewHipHop praised the song, calling it a "proof of [Logic's] abilities as an emcee", writing: "The production bangs heavy throughout this track and Logic showcases his slick wordplay and versatile flows throughout." Bianca Gracie of Fuse felt the song "gives the mainstream side a different side of the rapper" and thinks that it "will earn respect from lovers of rap music". Tony Centeno of "Vibe" complimented Logic for "delivering a brand new extensive verse filled with nothing but rapid-fire wordplay".

Sa'd ibn Zayd

Sa‘d ibn Zayd ibn Muḥsin () was Sharif and Emir of Mecca from 1666 to 1672, 1692 to 1694, 1694 to 1702, and briefly in 1704.
Birth.
He was born in 1052 AH (1642/1643), the son of Zayd ibn Muhsin.
First reign.
Sharif Zayd died in Mecca on Tuesday, 3 Muharram 1077 AH (6 July 1666), after 35 years on the throne. He was survived by four sons: Sa'd, Hasan, Muhammad Yahya, and Ahmad. Only Sa'd and Hasan were present at his death; Muhammad Yahya was in Medina and Ahmad was in Najd.
After Zayd's death there was disagreement among the ashraf as to who should succeed him as Emir of Mecca. The majority sided with Hamud ibn Abd Allah, whose claim lay in the fact that it was his father, Sharif Abd Allah ibn Hasan, who had originally summoned Zayd from Yemen to be co-ruler with his son Muhammad ibn Abd Allah. Only a small party of ashraf backed Sa'd for the Emirate, namely: Mubarak ibn Muhammad al-Harith, Rajih ibn Qaytbay, Abd al-Muttalib ibn Muhammad, Mudar ibn al-Murtada, Husayn ibn Yahya, Faris ibn Barakat, and Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Ali. Both sides petitioned Imad Agha, who as sanjak-bey of Jeddah and shaykh al-haram of Mecca was the Ottoman government's representative in the land. Imad Agha decided in favor of Sa'd and sent him the khil'ah (robe of honor).

North Penn Water Authority

The North Penn Water Authority (NPWA) is a water utility providing drinking water to portions of Bucks and Montgomery counties in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, centered around the North Penn Valley region. The NPWA is a municipal authority that is owned by the municipalities that is serves. The NPWA provides drinking water to over 34,000 customers in 20 municipalities. The authority was formed in 1964 and has grown over the years.
Service area.
The NPWA provides drinking water to portions of Bucks and Montgomery counties centered around the North Penn Valley region, serving over 34,000 customers. In Montgomery County, the NPWA serves the boroughs of Hatfield, Lansdale, and Souderton; all of Franconia Township, Lower Salford Township, Skippack Township, and Towamencin Township; almost all of Hatfield Township; most of Worcester Township; and small portions of Montgomery Township, Salford Township, Upper Gwynedd Township, and Upper Salford Township. In Bucks County, the NPWA serves the borough of Sellersville; parts of Hilltown Township and New Britain Township; and small portions of the borough of New Britain, East Rockhill Township, and West Rockhill Township.
Governance.
The NPWA is a municipal authority that is owned by the municipalities that it serves. The authority is governed by a ten-member Board of Directors who are appointed to five year terms by member municipalities. The Board of Directors hold meetings once a month that the public can attend. The NPWA has a management team that is in charge of the daily operations. As of 2018, Anthony J. Bellitto, Jr., P.E. is the Executive Director of NPWA.
Water supply.
About 90 percent of the water delivered to customers by the NPWA is treated at the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant in Chalfont, a facility that is owned jointly with the North Wales Water Authority (NWWA). The water treated at this plant comes from the North Branch Neshaminy Creek, which flows into Lake Galena, a reservoir for the water treated at the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant. Water released from Lake Galena flows down the creek to the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant. During the summer months and times when water levels are low, additional water is pumped from the Delaware River at Point Pleasant and diverted to the North Branch Neshaminy Creek near Gardenville. The Forest Park Water Treatment Plant is the largest water treatment plant in Bucks County and processes up to 40 million gallons water a day for delivery to NPWA and NWWA customers. From the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant, a main carries water to the NPWA service area, where it is delivered to customers. The NPWA also operates 15 groundwater wells across its service area in Bucks and Montgomery counties to supply water.
History.
The origins of the authority date back to 1958 when a group of citizens from several municipalities in the North Penn Valley region formed the North Penn Water Resources Association to improve the drinking water supply in the area. The NPWA was incorporated on August 10, 1964, with Lansdale, Souderton, Franconia Township, Hatfield Township, Lower Salford Township, Towamencin Township, and Worcester Township the original municipalities that formed the authority. In August 1965, the NPWA purchased and began operating the water systems in Lansdale and Souderton. A transmission line was soon built to connect the water systems in the two boroughs. The authority gained more customers as the North Penn Valley region grew in population. In 1975, the NPWA acquired four small water systems and eight wells in Skippack Township and a small water system in Hilltown Township. Additional municipalities became members of NPWA in the 1980s, with Skippack Township joining in April 1986 and New Britain Township and the borough of Hatfield joining in 1987. The NPWA took over the water system in New Britain Township in August 1987 and the borough of Hatfield in February 1988.
In the 1970s and 1980s, water shortages became a problem for the NPWA as the population of the service area grew. An expansion to 55 groundwater wells and the purchase of surface water from outside sources helped alleviate the problem. Despite this, an additional surface water source was needed to supply the authority in the future. In 1987, the NPWA and the NWWA began construction of an Interim Treatment Plant at the present location of the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant in Chalfont. The interim plant opened in February 1989 and supplied 3.2 million gallons of water a day. Construction of a permanent Forest Park Water Treatment Plant to supply 20 million gallons of water a day began in June 1991. The Forest Park Water Treatment Plant began operation on June 21, 1994. An expansion to the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant in 2007 increased the output to 40 million gallons of water a day to keep up with the growing water use of the area. In 2011, the NPWA took over the water system in Sellersville.

Nick Seeler

Nick Seeler (born June 3, 1993) is an American professional ice hockey defenseman who is currently playing for the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted by the Minnesota Wild in the fifth round, 131st overall, in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. Prior to turning professional, Seeler played for the University of Nebraska Omaha and University of Minnesota.
Playing career.
As a student at Eden Prairie High School for four years, Seeler played on both the junior varsity hockey team and school golf team. However, he saw limited playing time due to his short stature until after a growth spurt in his junior year where he began to develop more as a player. Before graduating, Seeler had been honored as a First-Team All-State selection, an All-Metro First Team choice, All-Lake Conference and a member of the All-Tournament Team in the State Tournament.
While in his senior year at Eden Prairie High School, Seeler committed to play NCAA Division 1 hockey for the University of Nebraska Omaha. He was later drafted 131st overall in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft by the Minnesota Wild. Following the draft, he then went on to play with the Muskegon Lumberjacks and the Des Moines Buccaneers in the United States Hockey League for the 2011–12 USHL season where he was named to the USHL All-Rookie Team. He stated that he felt going through the USHL before joining the collegiate league would be the best way to prepare for the jump from junior hockey to college.
Seeler then played for the University of Nebraska Omaha for two seasons before transferring to the University of Minnesota in 2014. He was not allowed to play in the 2014–15 season due to NCAA transfer rules. He then played one season for the University of Minnesota before signing an entry level contract with the Minnesota Wild and joining their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Iowa Wild, for the 2016–17 AHL season.
After attending the Minnesota Wild's 2017 training camp, Seeler was reassigned to the AHL to begin the 2017–18 season. He scored his first AHL goal on January 7, 2018, against the Cleveland Monsters.
Seeler was called up to the NHL from the Iowa Wild on February 11, 2018. He made his NHL debut the next day against the New York Rangers. Seeler recorded his first NHL point on February 22, 2018, in a game against the New Jersey Devils. He assisted on Chris Stewart's goal to help the Wild win 4–2. After his first NHL fight against Luke Witkowski on March 4, 2018, Seeler missed three games due to a bicep strain. He returned to the lineup on March 13, 2018, to play in a 5–1 loss to the Colorado Avalanche. Seeler made his playoff debut during the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Winnipeg Jets. He recorded two points in five games as the Wild lost in five games to the Jets.
As a restricted free agent, Seeler agreed to a three-year, $2.175 million contract with the Wild on July 1, 2018. On November 3, after going pointless in his first 12 NHL games that season, Seeler recorded two assists and his first NHL goal in a 5–1 win over the St. Louis Blues.
During the 2019–20 season, on February 3, 2020, Seeler was claimed by the Chicago Blackhawks off waivers from the Wild. He made 6 appearances with the Blackhawks registering 1 assist before the season was prematurely halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
After attending the Blackhawks training camp for the delayed 2020–21 season, Seeler failed to make the opening night roster and was reassigned to AHL affiliate, the Rockford IceHogs. On January 16, 2021, Seeler was placed on unconditional waivers in order to mutually terminate his contract with the Blackhawks.
Seeler sat out for the remainder of the season and on the opening day of free agency he returned to the NHL in agreeing to a one-year, two-way contract for the season with the Philadelphia Flyers on July 28, 2021.
Personal life.
His parents are Dan and Kris Seeler and he has two older sisters, Ashley and Kelly. Kelly was a member of the Minnesota's national championship hockey team in 2012.

Horn to Horn

Horn to Horn is an album by saxophonists Teddy Edwards and Houston Person which was recorded in 1994 and first released on the Muse label in 1996.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Scott Yanow notes that "This is a logical and very successful collaboration featuring the East Coast tenor Houston Person and L.A.'s legendary Teddy Edwards. Although one can generally tell the two veterans apart (Person has a heavier sound than the comparatively light-toned Edwards), the co-leaders are quite complementary and work together well in the tradition of Sonny Stitt and Gene Ammons ... Edwards and Person pay tribute to eight great tenors of the past (John Coltrane, Ben Webster, Lester Young, Stan Getz, Coleman Hawkins, Gene Ammons, Dexter Gordon, and Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis) through their renditions of eight standards ...

A Toast To Panama Red

A Toast To Panama Red is the fourth studio album by The Masters Apprentices, released in January 1972 on Regal Zonophone. It would be the group's final studio album until 1988's reunion album "Do What You Wanna Do".
Background and recording.
In April 1971, "Choice Cuts" was released in Australia to widespread acclaim, reaching #11 on the "Go-Set" Top 20 Album Charts. They made numerous TV appearances, including a three-song live set for the ABC's "GTK" which included a live-in-the-studio performance of "Future of Our Nation". 
When "Choice Cuts" was released in the UK it was well received by critics. EMI's John Halsall called from London to inform them that "Choice Cuts" was receiving glowing notices in the English music press, including a rave review in "Melody Maker". Halsall urged them to return to London as soon as possible and that they would be able to record a new album there.
By the time they arrived in the UK in July, interest was waning. At this point a new UK label Bronze—who had just signed Slade and Uriah Heep—made an approach to the band. Although the group was hesitant, being still signed to EMI, they decided to use the offer as leverage in hopes of getting a better deal out of EMI. Wheatley delivered an ultimatum to EMI Australia, demanding that they either release the band from their contract or match Bronze's offer of £90,000 (or $180,000 in Australia). EMI did neither, responding with an advance of $1,000. Fearing legal repercussions, the band ruefully declined Bronze's offer, Keays' later opined that the best course of action would have been to "sign with Bronze and let the lawyers work it all out later."
Returning to Abbey Road in September 1971, the band were reunited with Jarratt and Brown, plus engineer (and Sgt Pepper's veteran) Richard Lush. According to Wheatley, one of The Masters Apprentices' tracks, "Games We Play", was recorded at George Martin's Air Studios, with Martin himself conducting the children's choir which features on the second part of the track. The new album was titled "A Toast to Panama Red", in homage to the Central American variety of marijuana.
Although Keays' recollections are more positive, Wheatley's own account of the album sessions is that they were an unhappy experience for him. He had a bad LSD trip the night before they went into the studio and began the recording in a negative frame of mind. Tensions mounted steadily during the recording and Wheatley did not play on some of the tracks, with his parts covered by Ford. According to Keays, Wheatley had been working part-time at a management agency over the previous few months and had insufficient time to rehearse because of his day job.
Reception.
The LP was lauded as one of the best Australian progressive releases, but it was largely ignored at the time. Sales were hindered by the lurid cover, which even Keays later admitted was not an ideal choice, being as garish as "Choice Cuts" was tasteful. Designed and painted by Keays, it was evidently a dig at the UK, and featured a grotesque psychedelic caricature of a bulldog's head wearing a Union Jack eye patch, its ears are skewered by an arrow from which dangles a tag, emblazoned with the album's title.
Track listing.
All songs written by Doug Ford and Jim Keays, except where noted.

2018 National Party of Australia leadership election

A leadership election was held on 26 February 2018 to select Barnaby Joyce's replacement as leader of the National Party of Australia and Deputy Prime Minister. Michael McCormack was elected party leader.
On the morning of 26 February, the Nationals held a party room meeting at which Joyce formally resigned to the backbench. McCormack was seen as the favourite to become leader, and was the only declared candidate as at 25 February. At the meeting he secured the support of a majority of the 21 National Party parliamentarians, seeing off a last-minute challenge from Queensland MP George Christensen.
Background.
Barnaby Joyce, who had led the National Party since replacing Warren Truss in February 2016, announced on 23 February 2018 that he would resign as party leader during a party room meeting on 26 February. His resignation followed scandals involving an affair with a former staffer and a sexual harassment allegation. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who was on a state visit to the United States at the time, appointed Regional Development Minister John McVeigh, from the Liberal branch of the Liberal National Party of Queensland, to take on Joyce's cabinet role as Acting Minister for Transport and Infrastructure.
Prior to the events of February 2018, Joyce was viewed as a charismatic leader, who had been re-elected as the member for New England with a substantial and increased majority in a December 2017 by-election. He maintained the support of a majority of his party members even as scandals unfolded, with some exceptions including the party's Western Australian branch and Andrew Broad.
Under the Coalition agreement between the Liberal and National Parties, the Nationals' leader serves as deputy prime minister in a Coalition government. Therefore, the decision of National Party members would determine who succeeded Joyce as deputy PM. Following the 2016 election, sixteen National Party MPs sat in the Australian House of Representatives (including six from the Queensland Liberal National Party, and Joyce himself as a backbencher since his announcement). Some of the highest-profile National Party parliamentarians, namely deputy leader Bridget McKenzie and Resources Minister Matt Canavan, sit in the Senate; no senator has served as deputy prime minister in the history of the position.

History.
Micab was conceived at Startup Weekend Cebu in November 2012 by co-founders Eddie Ybanez and Kenneth Baylosis. They originally envisioned Micab as a SMS-based taxi-hailing solution, but eventually pivoted into a mobile app available on both Android and iOS.
In July 2017, Micab was serving about 20,000 passengers per month, with more than 200,000 monthly bookings. It announced two major partnerships with both the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA) and the Association of Taxi Operators in Metro Manila (ATOMM), giving Micab access to more than 20,000 taxis.

Chintalarayaswami Temple

Chintalarayaswamy Temple or Sri Chintala Venkataramana Temple is a Hindu Vaishnavite temple situated at Tadipatri, a town in the Anantapur District of Andhra Pradesh, India. The Temple is dedicated to Lord Venkateswara, a form of Vishnu, who is referred to as Chintala Venkataramana. The temple was built by Pemmasani Timmanayudu II of the Pemmasani Nayaks. It is situated on the bank of the Penna River, which passes through the town. The temple is known for its granite sculptures and is classified as one of the Monuments of National Importance by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The temple has a "Garuda Mandapa" built as chariot with rotating granite wheels, which is similar to the one found in the Vithala Temple of Hampi.
Etymology.
According to legend, it is believed that, the presiding deity Venkateswara was found in the Tamarind (Telugu: Chinta) tree and hence got the name Chintala Venkataramana.
History.
The Temple was built during reign of Vijayanagara empire in mid 16th Century. Pemmasani Timmanayudu II, a contemporary of Vira Narasimharaya and Krishnadevaraya, built this temple. Timmanayudu built this temple after Lord Vishnu is said to have told Timmanayudu in a dream that a temple should be constructed for him at Tadipatri. Timmanayudu appointed two archakas and a chief-priest, and he gifted lands to the temple. The Chintalarayaswamy Temple is considered one of the finest examples of Vijayanagara architecture. The initial structure may belong to Saluva dynasty, but the entrance towers belongs to the Tuluva dynasty.
Architecture.
The temple was built in Dravidian style.

When Two Worlds War is a 1993 video game by Impression Games. It is a strategic simulation of interplanetary conflict.
Critical reception.
Amiga Format thought the game was neither simplistic nor shallow. Meanwhile, CU Amiga Magazine felt the game was identical to Utopia in every way, sans the fun.
Computer Gaming World's Martin Cirulis praised the packaging and the manuals, with the interface being described as "exceptionally clear and easy to use." On the gameplay front, he felt that the game lacked personality, with "potential strengths... left unexplored." He found the AI too easy to win against, even at the highest level. Overall, he thought that while the game was not bad, the delivery fell short of the potential, comparing the game to getting Battlestar Galactica when Star Wars was what had been promised.

Court Garden, Marlow

Court Garden in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England, is a Grade II* listed on the English Heritage Register. It was built in about 1758 by Dr William Battie, an eminent physician. It was sold in 1776 to Richard Davenport and remained in the Davenport family until 1894. It was then sold and became the home of the Griffin family for the next thirty years. Today it is part of Higginson Park and is a venue for special events.
Dr William Battie.
William Battie (1704-1776) was born in 1704 in Modbury. His father was Reverend Edward Battie who was the Vicar of this town. He was educated at Eton College and then went to University of Cambridge where he won a Craven Scholarship. He began practicing as a physician in 1729 in Cambridge and then later in Uxbridge and finally in London where he had a very successful practice.
In 1740 he inherited a large fortune from his relative Edward Colman of Brent Eleigh Hall in Suffolk who had died a bachelor. In the previous year he had married Ann Goode who he had known since his childhood. She was the daughter of Barnham Goode a teacher at Eton when he had attended this school. They were married in Oxford and went to live in a house in Twickenham which he built for himself and his family in 1740. The couple had three daughters.
He became a fellow of the College of Physicians in 1738; censor in 1743, 1747, and 1749; Harveian orator in 1746; and president in 1764. He was Lumleian orator from 1749 to 1754.
He wrote numerous books on medical matters particularly mental illness and worked for many years at St Lukes Hospital in London. He died in 1776 and was buried at Kingston upon Thames near his wife. After his death his daughter Anne sold Court Garden to Richard Davenport.
The Davenport family.
Richard Davenport (1729-1799) who bought Court Garden in 1776 was a surgeon of Essex Street in London. He was the younger son of Davies Davenport (1696-1740) who owned Capesthorne Hall. In 1769 he married Fanny Maria Sanxay who was the daughter of Edmund Sanxay, a wealthy landowner from Cheam. Sanxay had only two daughters so when he died in 1787 Fanny Maria and her sister inherited his properties. She died in 1796 and Richard died in 1799. As they had no children Court Garden was left to his nephew Davies Davenport. 
Davies Davenport (1757-1837) did not live in Court Garden because his main residence was his ancestral home of Capesthorne Hall. He rented it to various tenants one of whom was General Alexander Hope who in 1810 was appointed Governor of the Military College when it was in Marlow before it was moved to Sandhurst. The next resident was Sir Alan Hyde Gardner, 2nd Baron Gardner who was there until his death in 1815.
Davies Davenport died in 1837 and his son Edward Davies Davenport (1778-1847) inherited the house. He was a prominent Member of Parliament. Like his father he lived at Capesthorne Hall and rented Court Garden to tenants. He died in 1847 and his son Arthur Henry Davenport inherited the property. Arthur died in 1867 and as he was a bachelor and had no children his cousin William Bromley-Davenport (1821–1884) inherited the house. When he died in 1884 his son Sir William Bromley Davenport (1862-1949) became the owner.
During this time Court Garden continued to be a rental property. In about 1882 Anthony Hutton, an African merchant took a 21 year lease on the house. However in 1891 he decided to leave England and the remainder of the lease was taken by Robert Griffin. He later bought the property from Sir William Bromley Davenport who advertised the house for sale in 1894.
Residents after 1900.
Robert Griffin (1838-1921) who owned the house by 1900 made significant repairs to the property which had been allowed to deteriorate before its sale. He was born in 1838 in Warwickshire. His father was an attorney and he also became a lawyer. In 1869 he married Caroline Sophia McClean. The couple had three children, two sons and a daughter. From 1900 until 1910 he represented Marlow on the Buckinghamshire County Council. He died in 1921 and the house was advertised for sale in 1926. It was purchased by public subscription and became a public park dedicated to Sir George Higginson.
Today it is part of Higginson Park and is a venue for special events such as weddings and parties.

Yeomanry Cavalry

The Yeomanry Cavalry was the mounted component of the British Volunteer Corps, a military auxiliary established in the late 18th century amid fears of invasion and insurrection during the French Revolutionary Wars. A yeoman was a person of respectable standing, one social rank below a gentleman, and the yeomanry was initially a rural, county-based force. Members were required to provide their own horses and were recruited mainly from landholders and tenant farmers, though the middle class also featured prominently in the rank and file. Officers were largely recruited from among the nobility and landed gentry. A commission generally involved significant personal expense, and although social status was an important qualification, the primary factor was personal wealth. From the beginning, the newly rich, who found in the yeomanry a means of enhancing their social standing, were welcomed into the officer corps for their ability to support the force financially. Urban recruitment increased towards the end of the 19th century, reflected in the early 20th century by increasingly common use of hired mounts.
The yeomanry was first used in support of local authorities to suppress civil unrest, most notably during the food riots of 1795. Its only use in national defence was in 1797, when the Castlemartin Yeomanry helped defeat a small French invasion in the Battle of Fishguard. Although the Volunteer Corps was disbanded following the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the yeomanry was retained as a politically reliable force which could be deployed in support of the civil authorities. It often served as mounted police until the middle of the 19th century. Most famously, the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry was largely responsible for the Peterloo Massacre, in which some 17 people were killed and up to 650 were injured, while policing a rally for parliamentary reform in Manchester in 1819. The yeomanry was also deployed against striking colliers in the 1820s, during the Swing riots of the early 1830s and the Chartist disturbances of the late 1830s and early 1840s. The exclusive membership set the yeomanry apart from the population it policed, and as better law enforcement options became available the yeomanry was increasingly held back for fear that its presence would provoke confrontation. Its social status made the force a popular target for caricature, particularly after Peterloo, and it was often satirised in the press, in literature and on the stage.
The establishment of civilian police forces and renewed invasion scares in the middle of the 19th century turned the focus of the yeomanry to national defence, but its effectiveness and value in this role was increasingly questioned. It declined in strength, surviving largely due to its members political influence and willingness to subsidise the force financially. A series of government committees failed to address the force's problems. The last, in 1892, found a place for the yeomanry in the country's mobilisation scheme, but it was not until a succession of failures by the regular army during the Second Boer War that the yeomanry found a new relevance as mounted infantry. It provided the nucleus for the separate Imperial Yeomanry, and after the war, the yeomanry was re-branded "en bloc" as the Imperial Yeomanry. It ceased to exist as a separate institution in 1908, when the yeomanry became the mounted component of the Territorial Force. Yeomanry regiments fought mounted and dismounted in both the First World War and the Second World War. The yeomanry heritage is maintained in the 21st century largely by four yeomanry regiments of the British Army Reserve, in which many 19th century regiments are represented as squadrons.
Background.
Europe experienced explosive population growth from the mid-18th century which, in Great Britain, was fed by improved farming methods introduced by the Agricultural Revolution. Around the same time, the Industrial Revolution brought increasing urbanisation, which led to ever greater demands for food away from farms. The more intensive cultivation required to meet these demands led to increased costs but left agricultural wages the same, resulting in poverty and starvation in rural communities. Poverty was also a problem in urban centres as increasing use of machinery put skilled labour out of work. Meanwhile, the political system had not kept up with the shifting population. While once prosperous towns that had become de-populated were still able to elect Members of Parliament (MPs) – the so-called rotten and pocket boroughs – major new towns such as Birmingham and Manchester were not represented. Poverty and disenfranchisement led to social discontent, giving rise to fears that the French Revolution would provide a model that might be emulated in Britain.
In 1793, the French revolutionary government declared war on Great Britain, adding fear of foreign invasion to that of domestic insurrection and leading to near panic in London. The regular British Army, which had already deployed six brigades alongside the Austrian army in the Netherlands, was not sufficient to defend the country, and the main military reserve, the militia, was considered neither effective nor trustworthy. It had been demobilised at the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War in 1783, and in the intervening decade it had been subject to cost-cutting measures that had left it deficient. It was embodied in 1792 as a precautionary measure against insurrection, but a body recruited predominantly from among the working class was itself suspect, to the extent that militia units were not trusted to be deployed in their own areas of recruitment until 1795. The government had previously resorted to volunteers to augment its forces in 1779, amid fears of a Franco-Spanish invasion, though this was short-lived and did not long survive the end of the war in the colonies. Considering that there was not enough time to address the militia's deficiencies, the government turned again to volunteers to bolster the nation's defences in 1794.
Origins.
The appeal for volunteers led to the creation of the Volunteer Corps, of which the Gentlemen and Yeomanry Cavalry, as it was then called, was the mounted component. A yeoman was traditionally a freeholder of respectable standing, one social rank below a gentleman, and the yeomanry's ranks were filled largely by landholders and tenant farmers. The officers were appointed by royal commission, in the person of the Lord Lieutenant, and generally came from the nobility and landed gentry. Yeomen were expected to provide their own mounts, which represented a high financial barrier to entry and ensured that the yeomanry was an exclusive and prestigious organisation. In addition to farmers, the yeomanry attracted professionals, tradesmen and skilled craftsmen to its ranks, though the strong ties to the farming community meant that yeomanry activities were scheduled with an eye on the agricultural calendar, and harvests in particular informed the training schedule.
The yeomanry was county based and could be called out (embodied) by the Lord Lieutenant or Sheriff. Members were paid while embodied and subject to military law in the event of invasion. Initially, troops were liable for service only in their home or adjacent counties, though some troops voted to be liable for service nationwide while others restricted themselves to service only in their home county. Although some troops quickly combined to form county regiments, such as the Wiltshire Yeomanry Cavalry in 1797, many remained independent for years. By the end of 1794, between 28 and 32 troops of yeomanry, each up to 60 men strong, had been raised. A government attempt to raise more cavalry by compulsion, the Provisional Cavalry Act of 1796, increased interest in volunteer cavalry, and by 1799 there were 206 yeomanry troops. By 1800, the Provisional Cavalry regiments had been either disbanded or absorbed into the yeomanry, where they were frequently ostracised because of their lower social status.
Initial deployments.
The yeomanry was as much an instrument of law and order as it was a military organisation, and its terms of service stressed defence against both insurrection and invasion. It was only once called upon to repulse a foreign invasion, in 1797, when the French Légion Noire landed at Fishguard in Wales, and the Castlemartin Yeomanry was part of the force that defeated the invaders in the Battle of Fishguard. The yeomanry was more active as a constabulary, and corps were called out during the treason trials in 1794, during the food riots of 1795, and in response to enclosure protests, the destruction wrought by Luddites and disturbances caused by disaffected, demobilised servicemen in the years leading up to the end of the wars with France.
By 1801, the yeomanry was 21,000 strong, with troops in most English, many Welsh and some Scottish counties. They were based in towns, villages and the estates of the nobility, and varied in quantity from one to more than twenty in any given county. Troops were also raised in Ireland, where they reflected the Protestant Ascendancy. The Peace of Amiens in 1802 resulted in reductions across the military, with cuts to the army and navy and the disembodiment of the militia. Legislation was passed to allow the Volunteer Corps to be retained without pay, but the yeomanry establishment nevertheless declined, only to increase again when war resumed in 1803. There were frequent invasion scares – most notably in 1804, when the beacons were lit in the Scottish lowlands and 3,000 volunteers and yeomanry assembled for what turned out to be a false alarm – and victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 did not fully eradicate the fears of a French landing.
Early 19th century legislation and decline.
The threat of invasion occupied much of the British political thinking until the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815, and in the period 1802–1803 alone there were 21 separate pieces of legislation designed to raise forces either voluntarily or compulsorily for the defence of the nation. The Volunteer Consolidation Act of 1804, which effectively governed the yeomanry until 1901, rationalised the confusion of legislation. The net result was to make voluntary service more attractive, a significant motivation being to avoid the compulsion of service in the unpopular militia. Faced with a deluge of volunteers, the War Office attempted to limit numbers. This caused an outcry, and administrative responsibility was transferred to the Home Office in 1803 as a result. By the following year, the number of volunteers and yeomanry together exceeded 342,000 men, significantly more than the government could arm in the immediate term, and in 1805 the yeomanry numbered just under 33,000 men.
A change of government in 1806 resulted in a change of policy, based on the belief that the volunteer force was an expensive solution which escaped central government control and undermined recruitment into the militia and regular army. The Local Militia Acts of 1808 created a new militia with incentives for volunteers to transfer into it. By 1813, the Local Militia had supplanted the need for a volunteer force, which had already declined to just under 69,000 men the previous year, and only a handful of volunteer corps remained. The yeomanry, however, was retained after the Napoleonic Wars as a politically reliable force. It was, nevertheless, reduced in numbers nationwide – figures for 1817 indicate an actual strength of around 18,000 – and in Gloucestershire, for example, of the 13 troops that existed in 1813, only the Gloucester Troop was kept on after 1815, to serve as mounted police.
Support to the civil power.
Policing was the responsibility of the parish constable and his urban counterpart, the watchman, under the auspices of the magistrates. As urban centres grew, increased crime was dealt with by temporary measures such as the Special Constabulary. None of these were sufficient to deal with large-scale riots. Although the regular army was disciplined and trusted enough to be used, it was too small and too widely dispersed to be an effective response, and the militia, while available as a local force, was not trusted. It fell, therefore, to the yeomanry to deal with civil unrest, and its numbers were soon increased as a result.
Post-Napoleonic Wars.
Agitation for constitutional reform by the Radical movement following the defeat of Napoleon resulted in frequent use of the yeomanry. Most famously, up to 17 people were killed and 650 wounded in the Peterloo Massacre of 1819, when the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry charged into a 60,000-strong crowd attending a rally in Manchester. On 2 April 1820, the Stirlingshire Yeomanry was called out during the Radical War – a week of strikes and unrest in Scotland – and three days later its Kilsyth Troop assisted the regular army's 10th Hussars in the arrest of 18 Radicals at the 'Battle of Bonnymuir'. In south Wales during the violent collier strikes of 1822, the Monmouth Troop, assisting the Scots Greys, used the flat of its swords to disperse a mob that was damaging coal trains, and the colliers pelted the Chepstow Troop with stones as it escorted coal wagons a few days afterwards. Elsewhere, the Staffordshire Yeomanry resorted to musketry, mortally wounding one person, when it was deployed to protect working colliers from their striking colleagues. In total, the yeomen of 12 different corps were called out to support the civil authorities on 19 separate occasions in 1822, and four years later, 13 different corps attended to 16 incidents.
Swing riots and political protests.
The demand for assistance was not uniform throughout the country, and even at its peak in 1820, less than 30 per cent of counties had called out their yeomanry. Civil unrest declined in the 1820s, and in 1827 local magistrates called upon the yeomanry only six times, a 90 per cent decrease compared to 1820. Faced with funding a force that it perceived to be increasingly unnecessary, the government reduced the yeomanry establishment on economic grounds. Of the 62 corps or regiments that then existed, those 24 that had not been called out in aid of the civil power in the preceding ten years, primarily from the southern counties of England, were disbanded. The remaining 38 corps were retained, though 16 of them were allowed to continue only at their own expense. It was, however, in the southern counties that the Swing riots erupted in 1830, a largely agrarian protest which resulted in the destruction of machinery in both town and country. As a result, many disbanded corps were resurrected and new ones raised, although it was a slow process and those corps of yeomanry that had survived the cuts were in much demand. The Wiltshire Yeomanry, for example, served in neighbouring counties as well as its own, earning it the prefix "Royal" in recognition of its many services. This regiment was responsible for the one fatality inflicted by the yeomanry during the riots, when its Hindon Troop fought a 500-strong mob of agricultural workers in the 'Battle of Pythouse' at Tisbury, Wiltshire, on 25 November 1830.
There was further civil unrest the year after the Swing riots, prompted by agitation for political reform following the defeat of the Second Reform Bill in the House of Lords. In Wales, the Glamorgan Yeomanry twice suffered humiliation – and in consequence, disbandment soon after – when miners and steelworkers occupied Merthyr Tydfil; one group of yeomen was ambushed and disarmed as they tried to make their way into town, and on a separate occasion another group was routed. Equally ineffective, though this time through no fault of its own, was a troop of the newly re-raised Gloucestershire Yeomanry. It was sent to Bristol when rioting broke out there in the autumn, but was ordered to leave shortly after arriving by the commander of the regular forces deployed in the city. A second troop of Gloucestershire yeomanry was subsequently joined by yeomen from Somerset and Wiltshire to help restore order in the aftermath of the rioting.
Chartist disturbances.
Although further urban unrest in the 1830s resulted in the deployment of the yeomanry in Montgomeryshire, Kent and Birmingham, the government legislated another round of cuts on cost grounds in 1838, reducing the 18,300-strong force by up to 4,700, though nine corps were allowed to continue without pay. As in 1827, the timing was unfortunate, and the rise of Chartism between 1837 and 1842 resulted in more demands on the yeomanry, to the extent that the commanders of the northern and Midlands military districts were given the ability to summon it directly rather than apply for permission to the Home Office. The greatest pressure came in 1842 – a year which saw six of the nine unpaid corps returned to the establishment and just under 1,000 new yeomen recruited – when civil unrest in 15 English, Welsh and Scottish counties required the deployment of 84 troops from 18 corps, which between them accumulated a total of 338 days' duty.
Despite being heavily committed, force was applied sparingly, and the yeomanry was deployed wherever possible as a reserve in support of other law enforcement agencies rather than as a primary agent itself. In 1838, a troop of the Yorkshire Yeomanry was held back during a serious disturbance on the North Midland Railway out of fear that their presence would inflame the situation. The following year, Sir Charles Napier, commander of the northern military district, responded to a magistrate request for yeomanry by saying "if the Chartists want a fight, they can be indulged without Yeomen, who are over-zealous for cutting and slashing". There were occasions when force was used, such as the violent confrontations in the Staffordshire Potteries and North Wales in 1839 between protesters and the yeomen of Staffordshire, Shropshire and Montgomeryshire; there were injuries on both sides and at least four deaths among the protesters.
Declining use as a constabulary.
Between 1818 and 1855, the peak years of its employment in support of the civil power, units of yeomanry were on duty somewhere for approximately 26 days per year on average. It remained available as a constabulary throughout the 19th century, if for no other reason than it was often the only option available to the magistrates, even though it was recognised that its presence might escalate tensions. Its use in this role, however, declined, and the last known deployment in support of the civil power was in 1885. The diminishing demand was fuelled by a decrease in large-scale protest and better law-enforcement options. The development of a national rail network from the mid-19th century enabled rapid deployment of regular forces, and the establishment of police forces in all counties by 1856 gave magistrates a better alternative than the yeomanry.
In 1892, the Brownlow Committee, set up to investigate the financial and military position of the yeomanry, recommended that its constitution should be specially adapted for home defence, and in 1907 the yeomanry was formally relieved of any role in aid of the civil power. A select committee report in 1908, "Employment of Military in Cases of Disturbances", encouraged a civil response to civil disorder. It recognised, however, the value of mounted forces, and recommended that police chiefs should maintain the ability to temporarily recruit men with yeomanry experience, casting yeomen thus enlisted as ordinary citizens subject to common law. The evolution of law enforcement can be seen in the government responses to the Tonypandy riots and the Liverpool general transport strike of 1910 and 1911, in which the yeomanry played no part when the regular army was deployed to restore order, supported in the former case by 500 Metropolitan Police.
Role in national defence.
In 1850, Henry FitzHardinge Berkeley, MP for Bristol, derided the yeomanry in Parliament as "maintained at vast expense; in peace a charge, in war a weak defence". By 1891, the force suffered, according to the Earl of Airlie – an experienced cavalry officer who was at the time adjutant of the Hampshire Carabiniers and who would later be killed leading the 12th Lancers in South Africa – from a lack of purpose and training. As its constabulary duties subsided, the yeomanry was left without any real role between the 1860s and 1892. Militarily weak and few in number, its effectiveness and value as a national defence force was increasingly questioned. It was regarded, not least among the members themselves, as light or auxiliary cavalry, and the yeomanry regiments adopted the titles of hussars, dragoons and lancers. Their training, in which they practised complex regular cavalry drills at the halt, emphasised the use of the sword. It was wedded to the idea of a cavalry role, despite increasing efforts by the government to encourage proficiency in the use of firearms.
The yeomanry was left untouched by the Volunteer Act of 1863, which governed the new Volunteer Force, leaving it still subject to legislation passed in 1804, although some changes were made to the way in which it was administered. More substantial changes were considered in a series of committees which attempted to assess the state and role of the yeomanry, and although the first, the Lawrenson Committee of 1861, achieved nothing, some changes to the organisation were made in 1870 by Edward Cardwell, Secretary of State for War. Independent troops and corps with less than four troops were abolished and the established strength set at 36 regiments, and basic training and drill requirements were laid down. There is also evidence that Cardwell hoped to transform the yeomanry from cavalry to mounted rifles, and an attempt to do so was also made in 1882, though both came to nothing. The Stanley Committee of 1875 recommended better training for the yeomanry leadership and the disbandment of regiments that returned an effective strength of less than 200 men for two consecutive years. Although the former was implemented, the latter was ignored.
Training in the latter half of the 19th century focussed more on mounted reconnaissance, flank protection and pickets, activities regarded by traditional cavalrymen as beneath their dignity, but it was rarely realistic, and the yeomanry proved resistant to the introduction of musketry standards. The Brownlow Committee sought to define a more professional role for the yeomanry by incorporating it into the nation's mobilisation scheme. As a result, in 1893, regiments were organised by squadron rather than troop, and understrength regiments were paired into brigades. In another attempt to encourage the use of firearms, allowances were increased for those who achieved a certain level of proficiency in musketry, but those who failed to do so in two consecutive years would be expelled. Nevertheless, the yeomanry's continued existence owed more to its significant representation in Parliament, which gave it a political influence beyond its numbers, than it did to its utility as a national defence force. The changes introduced by the Brownlow Committee were, according to Henry Campbell-Bannerman, leader of the Liberal Party then in opposition, the yeomanry's last chance to justify its existence.
Imperial Yeomanry.
By 1899, the yeomanry was at its lowest point. It was a small force, largely untouched by developments since its founding in 1794, of uncertain value and unclear benefit. It took major failures in the regular forces during the Second Boer War to restore the yeomanry to relevance. In October and November 1899, Lieutenant-Colonel A. G. Lucas, the yeomanry's representative in the War Office and a member of the Loyal Suffolk Hussars, suggested the yeomanry as a source of reinforcement in South Africa. His proposal was initially declined, but the disastrous events of Black Week in December, in which the British Army suffered three defeats in quick succession, prompted a rethink, and on 2 January 1900 the Imperial Yeomanry was created. It was a separate body from the domestic yeomanry, free of the home force's restriction to service only in the UK, and was organised by companies and battalions rather than squadrons and regiments, betraying its role as mounted infantry rather than cavalry.
By the end of the war, some 34,000 volunteers had served in the Imperial Yeomanry, although little more than 12 per cent of that number had been recruited from the domestic yeomanry. The experience in South Africa convinced the authorities of the value of a mounted force and influenced the Militia and Yeomanry Act of 1901. The law transformed the yeomanry, which it renamed "en bloc" to Imperial Yeomanry, from cavalry into mounted infantry, replacing the sword with rifle and bayonet as the yeoman's primary weapon. It introduced khaki uniforms, mandated a standard four-squadron organisation and added a machine-gun section to each regiment. The yeomanry resisted the retirement of the sword and the loss of "cavalry" from its title, a reflection of its own aspirations and the wider debate about the role of cavalry.
Territorial Force.
A key issue exposed by the Boer War concerned the ability of the auxiliary forces to reinforce the regular army in times of crisis. In 1903, the Director of General Mobilisation and Military Intelligence reported an excess of home defence forces which, because they were not liable for service overseas, could not be used to expand an expeditionary force in foreign campaigns. This occupied much of the debate around military reform in the first decade of the 20th century, and gave the yeomanry the opportunity to retain its role as cavalry by positioning itself as a semi-trained reserve to the numerically weak regular cavalry. This was reflected in a change to the training instructions issued to the Imperial Yeomanry in 1902 and 1905. The former warned the yeomanry not to aspire to a cavalry role and made no distinction between yeomen and mounted infantry, but the latter merely proscribed the traditional cavalry tactic of shock action while otherwise aligning the yeomanry with the cavalry.
The changed focus in training was prompted by plans to allocate six yeomanry regiments as divisional cavalry in the regular army, supported by the establishment within the Imperial Yeomanry of a separate class of yeoman free of the restriction on service overseas. This, however, relied on men volunteering for such service, and offered the regular army no guarantee that enough men would do so. That enough would volunteer was made more doubtful by the requirement that they should abandon their civilian lives for the six months of training considered necessary for them to be effective in such a reserve role. As a result, the plans were dropped from the final legislation that combined the Volunteer Force and the yeomanry, now without the "Imperial" prefix, into a single, unified auxiliary organisation, the Territorial Force, in 1908. The yeomanry ceased to be a discrete institution and was, as one yeoman put it, "slumped in with the volunteers".
Recruitment.
In the first half of the 19th century, the number of corps and overall strength fluctuated in line with the incidence of civil disturbance, reflecting the government's reliance on the yeomanry as a police force and its willingness to finance it. Peterloo sullied the yeomanry's reputation in many quarters, but it also prompted a surge in recruitment, reversing the reductions implemented after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. By 1820, the yeomanry establishment had been restored to its war-time peak of some 36,000 men, although its effective strength was actually some 6,000 short of that number. The same cycle was repeated in the late 1820s when, after 10 years of political stability, the government reduced the yeomanry to between 8,350 and 10,700 men, only to increase it again in the 1830s following the outbreak of the Swing riots. Yeomanry strength peaked on this cycle in 1835 at an effective strength of 19,365.
Further government cuts in 1838 were once again reversed after the outbreak of the Chartist disturbances, and effective strength peaked again in 1845 at 15,249 men. Numbers subsequently fell once more, and although they were bolstered by invasion scares in the middle of the 19th century, a general decline set in as the yeomanry role in support of the civil power diminished. By 1900, the yeomanry establishment stood at just over 12,000 with an actual strength some 2,000 short of that figure. A wave of enthusiasm during the Second Boer War doubled the size of the yeomanry, and the Militia and Yeomanry Act of 1901 set an establishment of 35,000, though effective strength was only around 25,000. To achieve these numbers, 18 new regiments were raised, 12 of them resurrected from disbanded 19th century corps.
Officer corps.
A commission in the yeomanry's officer corps entailed expenses which, for a troop captain in 1892, were on average £60 per year () in excess of allowances received. These costs imposed a financial qualification on appointments and made such positions the preserve of the elite. While a proportion of the yeomanry's leadership, between eight and fifteen per cent over the course of its existence, came from the nobility, the main demographic from which officers were recruited was the landed gentry. The coincidence of wealth and position in society was reflected in the leadership of the yeomanry. In 1850, for example, 31 per cent of the officer corps were magistrates and a further 14 per cent held even greater authority as a Lord or Deputy Lieutenant, and the 828 yeomanry officers then serving included 5 Lords Lieutenant, 111 Deputy Lieutenants, 255 Justices of the Peace, 65 Members of Parliament and 93 officers with previous military experience. This element changed little over time, and the number of county elites serving in 1914 was practically the same as in 1850.
Although social status was in some cases a prerequisite for commissions, personal wealth was the predominant factor. With its access to the county elite and appetite for wealth, the yeomanry officer corps was an avenue for 'new money' to gain social status and position. This was evident even in the early days – the Staffordshire Yeomanry contained a number of newly rich officers from industry and business before 1820 – and increasing numbers were able to elevate their social position via commissions in the yeomanry throughout the 19th century. Another theme in officer recruitment was family tradition. The Churchill family, for example, was involved in the Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars between 1818 and 1914, the last being Winston Churchill, who commanded a squadron even while Home Secretary and later First Lord of the Admiralty. Dukes of Beaufort served with the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars for over 150 years from its formation in 1834, providing the regiment's colonel or honorary colonel for all but 13 of them.
The high barrier to entry meant that the pool of officer candidates was limited, and the yeomanry consistently struggled to find enough officers. Those that were found were sometimes of questionable value. Officers were not always able to attend to their yeomanry duties, either because they lived too far away or, as in the case of Winston Churchill, had more pressing demands on their time. In 1875, an inspecting officer complained about inefficiency in troop leadership, but the introduction of mandatory formal training for yeomanry officers that year did not improve matters. Lord Chesham, Inspector General of the Imperial Yeomanry in South Africa during the Second Boer War, spoke in 1904 of the poor quality of yeomanry officers during that conflict. Promotions were more an indication of an officer's precedence, in both society and regiment, and his ability to spend time and money on the latter, than of his merit for the role.
An element of professionalism was provided by ex-regular army officers, who comprised 23 per cent of the officer corps in 1876 and 14 per cent in 1914. Furthermore, within each corps, training and administration was controlled by a permanent staff led by an adjutant of at least four years regular military experience. Even then, social status was often a factor in the selection of adjutants and, with applications being made directly to the colonel of a regiment, a measure of county influence was required for appointment.
Rank and file.
In 1889, an MP described the yeomanry as "a survival from the days when tenants followed their landlords to the field". There is evidence that some of the rank and file were required to serve as a condition of their tenancy, in one case as late as 1893. On the whole, however, landlords did not have the ability, or at least the will, to coerce a tenantry which served, or indeed refused to serve, of its own free will. If the county elite commanded any influence in this matter, it was generally, in the class-driven society of 19th-century Britain, on terms of deference rather than subservience.
Although farmers represented the largest single demographic in the rank and file, statistics indicate that, between 1817 and 1915, just under half of yeomen were recruited from outside of the farming community. Other demographics appearing in the albeit incomplete data were merchants (4.9 per cent), professionals (5.6 per cent), small businessmen (14.9 per cent), artisans (13.5 per cent) and skilled or unskilled labourers (4.9 per cent). In some cases the ratio of farmers within the same corps varied over time, an example being the Ayrshire Yeomanry, which comprised over 81 per cent farmers and their sons in 1831, a number which dropped to just over 60 per cent by 1880. The 1st Devon Yeomanry, on the other hand, shows largely unchanged ratios for the years 1834 (44.7 per cent) and 1915 (40.2 per cent). The ratios also varied between corps; for example, over 76 per cent of the Lanarkshire Yeomanry (Upper Ward) between 1822 and 1826 were farmers, but the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry of 1819 contained none.
The early appearance of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry demonstrates an urban theme in yeomanry recruitment that became more marked as the 19th century progressed, influenced to some extent by an agricultural downturn in the late-19th century. In contrast to Lanarkshire's Upper Ward regiment, its Glasgow and Lower Ward regiment, raised in 1848 and later to become the Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry, was recruited from the city's middle classes. In the 1860s, the Leicestershire Yeomanry and the South Salopian Yeomanry (Shropshire) were both recruiting from towns in their territories, and by 1892 all but one troop of the Middlesex Yeomanry were recruited in London. The urban element was not without its own issues of class. The rank and file of the Edinburgh Troop in the 1830s consisted mainly of gentlemen who were charged £12 () to join, and the commander of the Middlesex Yeomanry's B Troop, which was known as the gentlemen's troop, believed there would be class friction if it was forced by the new squadron system of 1893 to join a troop of lesser status.
The increasing use of hired mounts, particularly after the turn of the century, also indicates a dilution of the rural contingent in the rank and file. The percentage of horses that were hired rose dramatically, from up to 14 per cent in the last quarter of the 19th century to around 50 per cent in the period 1905–1907. Although this was a predictable trend in the case of, for example, the largely urban-recruited Middlesex Yeomanry, the more rurally-based East Kent Yeomanry experienced a progressive decline in the ownership of horses, from 76 per cent in 1880 to 66 per cent in 1884 and a little over a half in 1894.
Popular perception.
Peterloo polarised opinions in the press, the Radical outlets framing it in terms of murder and massacre and the establishment outlets tending more to a defence of the yeomanry. Although an extreme episode, the events at St. Peter's Field coloured perceptions of the yeomanry among the politically-involved working class, who equated it with the abuse of civil power. Negative perceptions persisted long after the event, even in the upper echelons of society, and as late as 1850 Peterloo was referenced when the yeomanry's "inclinations" were criticised in Parliament. In the mainstream national press, however, as Peterloo became yesterday's news, so too did the yeomanry, and, outside of public events which it attended in a ceremonial role, it was seldom reported on. More often, the yeomanry was the subject of caricature, in which yeomen were portrayed as old, incompetent and waving blood-stained weapons. Caricature evolved into satire, and magazines such as "Punch" regularly ridiculed the force as the epitome of bumbling high society, with overweight yeomen unable to master their weapons or the sick, undersized horses they rode. Common themes in the portrayal of the yeomanry in books and on stage included amateurs with delusions of grandeur, social climbing, self-importance and a greater concern for leisure and appearance than national defence.
The yeomanry's less confrontational activities resulted in a more positive interaction with the general public. It was often generous in its support for local charities, and its gatherings, whether for training or social events, injected wealth into local economies, to the extent that towns would petition regiments to be selected as venues for such occasions. Sporting events and pageantry, particularly the many occasions on which the yeomanry escorted royalty and visiting dignitaries, also drew appreciative crowds. The presentation of colours to the Wiltshire Yeomanry in 1798, for example, was watched by over 20,000 spectators, yeomanry bands entertained visitors at the opening of the Nottingham Arboretum in 1852, and the Royal Midlothian Yeomanry Cavalry Races in 1863 attracted a considerable attendance.
Although the political allegiance of yeomanry MPs in the House of Commons was fairly evenly split between the two main parties by the early 20th century, this was after a gradual shift in political affiliations since 1843, when the ratio of politically active members of the yeomanry was significantly Tory. "The Satirist" cast the yeomanry as "ultra Tories" in 1838, and the perception of the force as an instrument of the Tory establishment made some local authorities cautious in its use against political reformers during the Chartist disturbances. In terms of the yeomanry leadership at least, the nature of the reform movement in the first half of the 19th century meant that the yeomanry was regularly pitted against a different class, but it was called upon to do so by governments of both political parties. Furthermore, its membership was not without sympathies for the causes it was called upon to police, and there are a number of cases in the early 1830s where the loyalties of some of its corps were doubted.
Funding, remuneration and terms of service.
Yeomen had to provide their own horses, but saddlery and uniforms were paid for, either by the officers or by subscriptions in the counties in which the troops were raised, leading to a variety of colourful and flamboyant choices in attire. Their weapons – swords, pistols and a proportion of carbines per troop – were funded by the government. Other than when called out for duty, when it would be paid as regular cavalry, the yeomanry received no remuneration until 1803, when the first allowances were granted. The confused legislation of the early 19th century meant that different corps, and even different troops within the same corps, operated under different terms and conditions until the Volunteer Consolidation Act of 1804 introduced some uniformity. It restricted pay to a maximum of 24 days per annum, set 12 days of training as the qualification for exemption from conscription into other auxiliary arms, offered bounties for active service and gave yeomen the right to resign on 14 days notice. It did not, however, amend the different areas of liability (military district or nationwide) set by previous legislation. In 1816, the annual training requirement was reduced to eight days, inclusive of two days travelling, and the next year an annual allowance of £1 10s () per yeoman was awarded to help with uniform and equipment costs.
In addition to weapons and allowances, expenses incurred by the government in maintaining the yeomanry included the permanent staff, compensation for losses and injuries to men and horses, and pay at 7s per day for annual training and when called out. Volunteers also benefitted by exemption from hair powder duty until 1869 and horse duty until 1874. Between 1816 and 1821, the cost of maintaining the yeomanry had risen by nearly 46 per cent, and with only seven per cent of the total cost directly attributable to aiding the civil power in 1819, governments struggled to justify the expense. Cuts to the force on economic grounds were legislated twice, in 1827 and 1838, saving £92,000 () and £22,000 () respectively.
Government funding, however, consistently fell short of actual requirements. Subsidisation of the yeomanry by its members, particularly the officers, was common practice throughout its existence, and not only during those periods when corps were maintained at their own expense. Lord Plymouth paid £6,200 () to equip a troop of Worcestershire Yeomanry in 1832, and the Earl of Dudley was reputed to have spent £4,000 (approximately ) per year on the same corps between 1854 and 1871. The second Duke of Buckingham and Chandos was said to have been bankrupted in 1848 in part by the massive contribution he made to his regiment, which received no government funding between 1827 and 1830. In 1882, it was calculated that officers paid an average of £20 each () and the men up to £5 each () towards the cost of their regiments, giving a total subsidy of £61,500 () in a year when the government voted a £69,000 budget () for the yeomanry. Twenty years later, the annual cost of being a yeomanry officer was estimated to be £100 () in excess of the pay and allowances received by the officer. This willingness to support itself with private funding was another major factor in the yeomanry's survival after its usefulness in suppressing civil disorder disappeared.
Changes were made to the yeomanry terms and conditions in the second half of the 19th century. The National Defence Act of 1888 made it liable to serve anywhere in the country, and four years later an annual capitation grant of £1 () was awarded. However, the force remained largely subject to the terms set by the Volunteer Consolidation Act of 1804 until the passage of the Militia and Yeomanry Act in 1901. The new legislation replaced the right to resign on 14 days' notice with a three-year term of service for new recruits; increased the annual training requirement to 18 days, 14 of which were compulsory; introduced a £3 allowance () per man and grants of £20 () and £30 () for squadron and regimental stores; reduced duty pay to 5s 6d per day (), compensated for by extra daily allowances for travel, musketry practice, forage during permanent duty, and squadron drills, which in total amounted to an extra 10s 6d (); and introduced a £5 allowance () for the hire of horses.
The incorporation of the yeomanry into the Territorial Force in 1908 introduced further adjustments. Duty pay was reduced by 1s 2d per day, compensated for by free rations, a messing allowance of 1s per day was introduced and £1 was awarded for reaching a set standard of horsemanship. The new organisation also introduced some significant changes to the terms and conditions, including a four-year term of service and reducing annual camp to fifteen days, eight of which were necessary to gain a certificate of efficiency. The most fundamental change of all, however, was the transfer of administration from the regiments to the newly created County Territorial Associations. These were made responsible for the provision of horses, and relieved the officers of the burden and expense of maintaining the regiments.
Heritage.
Yeomanry regiments served overseas during the First World War, in France, at Gallipoli, in Egypt and during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The nature of the conflict in Europe precluded the use of mounted forces; cavalry actions were rare, and several regiments finished the war re-purposed as infantry. The same fate befell a number of yeomanry regiments posted to the Middle East, although the yeomanry 2nd Mounted Division, having fought as infantry at Gallipoli, reverted to the cavalry role on its return to Egypt. Being more conducive to mounted operations, the Sinai and Palestine Campaign saw extensive use of the yeomanry, though it often fought dismounted. Some of the last ever cavalry charges conducted by the British Army were made by yeomanry regiments during the campaign, by the 1/1st Warwickshire Yeomanry and 1/1st Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars in the charge at Huj on 8 November 1917, followed five days later with a charge by the 1/1st Royal Bucks Hussars in the Battle of Mughar Ridge.
In 1921, of the 56 yeomanry regiments active after the First World War, only 14 were retained in the cavalry role, while 16 were disbanded and the remainder converted to either batteries of the Royal Field Artillery or armoured car companies of the Tank Corps. As with previous attempts to relieve the yeomanry of its cavalry role, a number of regiments resisted the change, concerned that the new roles would result at best in an unacceptable change to the unique character of the force and at worst wholesale resignations. Political lobbying succeeded only in increasing the number of regiments to be retained from the originally proposed ten.
The yeomanry saw active service during the Second World War in armour, artillery, anti-aircraft and anti-tank roles. Units fought in Europe during the Battle of France, the Normandy landings and the subsequent campaign in North-West Europe, in North Africa during the Western Desert Campaign, in Italy and against Japanese forces in Singapore and Burma. Yeomanry regiments were also deployed in their traditional cavalry role to Palestine, though by 1941 only three regiments still retained their horses. The last action by British cavalry on horseback was fought on 10 July against Vichy French forces in Syria by the Queen's Own Yorkshire Dragoons, which also had the distinction of being the last regiment on active service in the British Army to give up its horses. Several post-war reorganisations resulted in more disbandments and the reduction of surviving regiments to cadres, leaving only the Royal Yeomanry, which performed an armoured reconnaissance role. In 1971 the cadres were restored to form three new yeomanry infantry regiments, and in the 21st century these were converted to armour-based roles alongside the Royal Yeomanry in the Royal Armoured Corps.

King Hezekiah bulla

The King Hezekiah bulla is a 3 mm thick soft bulla (piece of clay with the impression of a seal) measuring 13 × 12 mm (½ in × ½ in). It was found in an archaeological excavation together with 33 other seals, figurines and ceramics, in an ancient refuse dump adjacent to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem by Israeli archaeologist Eilat Mazar.
Description.
The bulla, excavated in 2015, was dated to the reign of Judean king Hezekiah between 716 and 686 BCE and bears an inscription in Paleo-Hebrew script: "Belonging to Hezekiah [son of] Ahaz king of Judah," and a two-winged sun, with wings turned downward, flanked by two ankh symbols symbolizing life.
Location.
The building in which the bulla was found had been an administrative or royal building that the Babylonians destroyed when they conquered Jerusalem in 586 BCE. According to Mazar, "although seal impressions bearing King Hezekiah's name have already been known from the antiquities market since the middle of the 1990s, some with a winged scarab (dung beetle) symbol and others with a winged sun, this is the first time that a seal impression of an Israelite or Judean king has ever come to light in a scientific archaeological excavation.
King Hezekiah.
The bulla attests that Jerusalem in King Hezekiah's time had a highly developed administrative system. Commenting on the discovery, Christopher Rollston of George Washington University said that the presence of ankh, an Egyptian symbol on a seal was not surprising as Judah had formed alliances with Egypt at various times during its history.
The Ophel is part of the ancient city of Jerusalem situated immediately south of the Temple Mount, the site of two Jewish temples in antiquity, considered to be the holiest site in Judaism and the third holiest site of Islam. Excavations at the site, a collaborative effort by the Israel Antiquities Authority and Hebrew University had unearthed some of the earliest artifacts ever found in Jerusalem dating as far back as the 12th and 11th centuries BCE.

Dzhokhar Dudayev Battalion

Dzhokhar Dudayev Battalion () is a Chechen volunteer battalion named after the first President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, Dzhokhar Dudayev. The battalion is made up mostly of Chechen volunteers, many of whom fought in the First Chechen War and Second Chechen War on the side of the Republic of Ichkeria. The battalion has been under the command of the British-educated Chechen national Adam Osmayev since 1 February 2015, after Munayev was killed in action at the Battle of Debaltseve in Eastern Ukraine.
Overview.
History.
The creation of the battalion began in early March 2014 in Denmark. This is where a large number of chechens, opposition to Russia and forced to emigrate after the Second Russian-Chechen War, are located. It was initiated by the Free Caucasus Organization, which was created in 2006 in Denmark by political emigrants from Caucasus countries in Europe. The battalion's founder and first leader Isa Munayev was appointed a military commander in charge of the defense of the Chechen capital by Ichkeria's President Aslan Maskhadov during the Battle of Grozny (1999–2000) where he used various urban warfare tactics including ambushes, car bombs, and mines during the defense of the city. Colonel Isa Sadigov became the chief of staff of the battalion. Some fighters in the battalion were recruited due to their interest in fighting in Syria but were convinced to go to Ukraine instead.
Battalion composition.
Desire to participate in the fight against Russian aggression in Ukraine was immediately revealed by more than 300 volunteers. The battalion includes Chechens, Georgians, Ingush, Azerbaijanis, Ukrainians and volunteers from European countries. 
Participation in warfare.
Chechen specialists take part in battles in the East of Ukraine and work as instructors, training young commanders.

Renault Sport Series

The Renault Sport Series (formerly known as World Series by Renault) is a motor racing series. The series currently consists of the Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0, and used to contain the Renault Sport Trophy and the Formula Renault 3.5 Series. The F4 Eurocup 1.6 was made part of the World Series in 2010, but was then folded for 2011. The flagship for the Renault Sport Series from its beginning to 2015 was the Formula Renault 3.5 Series (often referred to as simply "World Series by Renault" or simply WSR). It became the Formula V8 3.5 in 2016, when Renault Sport retired its backing.
History.
Renault started the Formula Renault V6 Eurocup in 2003, as a support series in Eurosport's Super Racing Weekends (ETCC and FIA GT Championship). The series ran with Tatuus chassis and a Nissan 3.5 L V6 engine.
In 2005, Renault left the Super Racing Weekend and started the World Series by Renault and the Formula Renault 3.5 Series, merging both the World Series by Nissan (whose engine contract had finished) and Renault V6 Eurocup. The Dallara chassis was retained, while the Renault V6 was improved to 425 PS. Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup and the Eurocup Mégane Trophy also joined the series in 2005 to support the main FR3.5 series.
At the end of July 2015, Renault Sport announced it would be withdrawing its backing to the Formula Renault 3.5 from 2016 onwards, handing the control of the series to co-organiser RPM. However, Renault Sport also said it would continue the Renault Sport Series with the Renault Sport Trophy and the Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup.

Close Encounters (Teddy Edwards and Houston Person album)

Close Encounters is an album by saxophonists Teddy Edwards and Houston Person which was recorded in 1996 and released on the HighNote label in 1999.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Michael G. Nastos states "A follow-up to their previous excellent CD "Horn To Horn" has the two veteran tenor saxophonists with the same drummer, Kenny Washington, joined by pianist Stan Hope and bassist Ray Drummond. They swing and stroll through another seven standards, Edwards with his lithe, breezy, matter-of-fact tone, Person displaying the bluesy, street smart literate, fluid approach that always holds him in good stead. ... The beautiful thing is that while Edwards continually refines, picking notes even more carefully, and Person digs deeper into his blue gutbucket, there's no stepping on toes. ... There's a bit of flailing, but the respectful attitude of these two present-day jazz giants is clear and admirable. This CD is easily as good as the first collaboration" In JazzTimes Jack Sohmer wrote "this 1996 Rudy Van Gelder-engineered studio date can easily rank alongside the best recordings of the two tenor teams of the past. Although not as technically daunting as the Griff ‘n’ Jaws combo, certainly the fluency that Edwards and Person demonstrate on blues, ballads, and medium swing grooves places them on a par with the Jug &amp; Sonny tandem. ... This recording succeeds especially because it is a conversation, not a shouting match, between two musicians who are secure enough in their abilities and reputations not to have to cut each other down at every turn".

Alice A. Casneau

Alice A. Tolliver Casneau (died 1953), known professionally as Mrs. A. A. Casneau, was an American dressmaker and clubwoman based in the Boston, Massachusetts area.
Career.
Casneau was a dressmaker in the Boston area with a recorded land purchase in Everett, Massachusetts. She was also active in the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs when it held its first national conference in Boston in 1895. 
In the same year as the Boston conference she gave a paper on "Morals and Manners" at the meeting of the Woman's Era Club. As a successful businessperson, she gave a presentation on "Dressmaking" at the first meeting of the National Negro Business League, held in Boston in 1900. "If there is no market for your wares in the community in which you live," she told the audience, "find a place that needs you, that needs just the talent that God has given you, and when you have found it, "fill it"." She was an associate member of the Massachusetts Branch of the Niagara Movement in 1907.
Casneau's "Guide for Artistic Dress Cutting and Making" (1895) was a "remarkable" 73-page booklet. It was one of the ten titles by black women authors available in the reception room of the National Conference of Colored Women in 1895. Her work was also featured on the literature table at the New England Hospital for Women and Children.
During World War I, she served on the executive committee of the Soldiers' Comfort Unit in Boston, a women's group that provided supports for black soldiers stationed in or near Boston.
In 1925, she was elected president of the League of Women for Community Service.
Personal life.
Alice Tolliver married Elmer E. Casneau, a barber, in 1887. They had a daughter, Pearl E. Casneau (Mrs. Theodore Gibson), born in 1892. Alice A. Casneau died in 1953 in Massachusetts.

Skin in the Game (book)

Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life (acronymed: SITG) is a 2018 nonfiction book by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a former options trader with a background in the mathematics of probability and statistics.
Taleb's thesis is that skin in the game—i.e., having a measurable risk when taking a major decision—is necessary for fairness, commercial efficiency, and risk management, as well as being necessary to understand the world. The book is part of Taleb's multi-volume philosophical essay on uncertainty, titled the "Incerto", which also includes "Fooled by Randomness" (2001), "" (2007–2010), "The Bed of Procrustes" (2010–2016), and "Antifragile" (2012). The book is dedicated to "two men of courage": Ron Paul, "a Roman among Greeks"; and Ralph Nader, "Greco-Phoenician saint".
Asymmetry and missing incentives.
If an actor pockets some rewards from a policy they enact or support without accepting any of the risks, economists consider it to be a problem of "missing incentives". In contrast, to Taleb, the problem is more fundamentally one of asymmetry: one actor gets the rewards, the other is stuck with the risks.
Taleb argues that "For social justice, focus on symmetry and risk sharing. You cannot make profits and transfer the risks to others, as bankers and large corporations do... Forcing skin in the game corrects this asymmetry better than thousands of laws and regulations."
The centrality of negative incentives.
Actors - per Taleb - must bear a cost when they fail the public. A fund manager that gets a percentage on wins, but no penalty for losing is incentivized to gamble with his clients funds. Bearing no downside for one's actions means that one has no "Skin In The Game", which is the source of many evils.
An evolutionary process is an additional argument for SITG. Those who err and have SITG will not survive, hence evolutionary processes will eliminate (physically or figuratively by going bankrupt etc) those tending to do stupid things. Without SITG, this process cannot work.
Examples.
Robert Rubin, a highly-paid director and senior advisor at Citigroup, paid no financial penalty when Citigroup had to be rescued by U.S. taxpayers due to overreach. Taleb calls this sort of a trade, with upside gain but no or limited downside risk, a "Bob Rubin trade."
Many war hawks don't themselves bear any risks of dying in a war they advocate.
Intellectual Yet Idiot.
Intellectual Yet Idiot (IYI) is a term coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his essay by the same name that refers to the semi-intelligent well-pedigreed "who are telling us 1) what to do, 2) what to eat, 3) how to speak, 4) how to think… and 5) who to vote for". They represent a very small minority of people but have an overwhelming impact on the vast majority because they affect government policy. IYI are often policy makers, academics, journalists, and media pundits. 
Taleb points out that being educated and "intellectual" does not always mean that someone isn't an idiot for most purposes. "You can be an intellectual yet still be an idiot. 'Educated philistines' have been wrong on everything from Stalinism to Iraq to low-carb diets."
Taleb dedicates a chapter to IYIs in his book Skin in the Game.
Usage.
The term was picked up and used late in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by Newt Gingrich when he criticized the negative response Trump received after the first presidential debate stating that "The Intellectual Yet Idiot class is so out of touch with America that they don't even realize how badly they are doing and how well Trump is doing." Gingrich has mentioned the term multiple times in interviews and speeches since then and has included in his book "Understanding Trump" a chapter called "The Rise of the IYI".
The term has since been used extensively and has been cited in numerous periodicals including "The Guardian", "Financial Times", and "The New Statesmen". Jonah Goldberg, in an article from "National Review", references the term in defense of non-liberal intellectuals who have been branded "anti-intellectual" by the Left.
Graham Vyse in his article "Democrats Should Stop Talking About Bipartisanship and Start Fighting" from "The New Republic" referenced Gingrich's use of IYI as divisive and that until the Republicans become more collaborative, "Democrats need to drop the subject, too, and fight like hell instead."
Other ideas.
Minority rules.
A "stubborn minority" can impose its will on the relatively disinterested majority. A halal eater, for example, will never eat non-halal food, but a non-halal eater isn't banned from eating halal. Thus, a catering company switches to serving halal meat despite its being preferred only by a tiny minority of its customers.
Christology.
The book delves into Christology. Michael Bonner writes: "Observers who are interested in, or baffled by, the Christological debates of the first five hundred years of Christianity may be shocked by Taleb’s explanation for the Church’s insistence upon the full humanity of Jesus. The short answer is that it was essential for God to have—literally—skin in the game, and that Christ’s full participation in crucifixion, self-sacrifice, and death made him the archetypal risk-taker."
Reception and criticism.
Branko Milanović wrote that Taleb has created "a full system that goes from empirics to ethics, a thing which is exceedingly rare in modern world." "The Economist" described reading the book as similar to "being trapped in a cab with a cantankerous and over-opinionated driver."
Matthew Syed of " The Times" was "mostly persuaded" by the main argument of the book. "The Guardian" published an ambivalent review, noting that Taleb's "combination of fearlessness, self-belief and immodesty adds up to charisma on the page" but that "every idea that sounds as if it might work in the abstract fails in the particular". Taleb responded with a list of the flaws and "reading comprehension" in the reviews in "The Economist" and "The Guardian" (claiming that journalists have an agency problem with subjects criticizing their profession for lack of skin of the game).

The audiobook version is narrated by Joe Ochman and reached #4 on the Audible.com's nonfiction list in March 2018.

James Leith Moody

James Leith Moody (1816–1896) was a British priest who served as Chaplain to the Royal Navy in China and to the British Army in the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Malta, and Crimea.
He was a member of the prominent British imperialist Moody family. He was the third son of Colonel Thomas Moody, Kt.. James Leith Moody's brothers included Major-General Richard Clement Moody, the first British Governor of the Falkland Islands, and the founder and first Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia; and Colonel Hampden Clement Blamire Moody CB, the Commander of the Royal Engineers in China. He was an uncle of Colonel Richard Stanley Hawks Moody CB.
He was named after Sir James Leith, to whom his father had served as aide-de-camp during the Napoleonic Wars, and of whom his father was an admirer.
Family.
James Leith Moody was born at St. Ann's Garrison, Barbados, West Indies, on 25 June 1816. He was the fifth of ten children of Colonel Thomas Moody, Knight of the Order of Military Merit, a scion of a prominent British imperialist family, and Martha Clement (1784 - 1868), who was the daughter of Richard Clement (1754 - 1829), a major Dutch landowner of Barbados. James Leith Moody's siblings included Major Thomas Moody (1809–1839); Major-General Richard Clement Moody (1813–1887), the first Governor of the Falkland Islands, and the founder and first Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia; Colonel Hampden Clement Blamire Moody CB (1821–1869), Commander of the Royal Engineers in China during the Second Opium War and the Taiping Rebellion; and Shute Barrington Moody (b. 1818), an expert on sugar cultivation in West Indies. His paternal grandmother was Barbara Blamire, a member of the Blamire family of Cumberland and cousin of the politician William Blamire MP and of the poet Susanna Blamire.
Moody was named after Sir James Leith, to whom his father had served as aide-de-camp during the Napoleonic Wars, and of whom his father was an admirer.
Education.
James Leith was educated at Tonbridge School and St. Mary Hall, Oxford (BA, 1840; MA, 1863). He was ordained as a priest, by John Kaye, Bishop of Lincoln, in 1841.
Career.
Leith served as chaplain to the Royal Navy in China and to the British Army in the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Malta, and Crimea.
Leith arrived in the Falkland Islands in October 1845, proved himself to be 'querulous and eccentric', and engaged in a feud with his own brother, Richard Clement Moody, the Governor of the Falkland Islands, and, subsequently, a feud with his brother's successor as Governor, George Rennie, although in the latter James Leith enjoyed the favour of the Colonial Office in London. James Leith Moody left the Falkland Islands in 1854. James Leith Moody was assistant chaplain to the British armed forces at Aldershot in 1859. He married Mary Willan, daughter of Rev. Willan, on 15 October 1863 at Winchester, and the couple had 5 children. His wife Mary died on 28 July 1890 at the age of 99 years. In 1865, he lived at Walmer, Kent. He was Rector of Virginstow, Launceston, Cornwall, from 1876 to 1879. He was Vicar of St. John the Baptist, Clay Hill, Enfield, from 1879 to 1885, when he retired to Dulwich, where he died in 1896.
He is commemorated on a stamp, of 1994, in the Foundation of Stanley Series of stamps, which was issued in the Falkland Islands.

FANTOM

FANTOM (Functional Annotation of the Mouse/Mammalian Genome) is an international research consortium first established in 2000 as part of the RIKEN research institute in Japan. The original meeting gathered international scientists from diverse backgrounds to help annotate the function of mouse cDNA clones generated by the Hayashizaki group. Since the initial FANTOM1 effort, the consortium has released multiple projects that look to understand the mechanisms governing the regulation of mammalian genomes. Their work has generated a large collection of shared data and helped advance biochemical and bioinformatic methodologies in genomics research.
Foundation.
In 1995, researchers of the RIKEN institute began creating an encyclopedia of full length cDNAs for the mouse genome. The goal of this 'Mouse Encyclopedia Project' was to provide a functional annotation of the mouse transcriptome. This mapping would provide a valuable resource for gene discovery, understanding disease-causing genes and homology across species. This promised to be a formidable task from the onset. Current methodologies were insufficient to generate full length cDNA clones at scale, and to be useful as a resource the annotations would have to be agreed upon by experts across different disciplines.
The first goal was to develop methods that allowed generation of full length cDNA libraries. Reverse transcriptase protocols at the time had difficulties with the secondary structure of mRNA, leading to abbreviated cDNAs that were difficult to align and invited further complications in downstream analysis. To surpass this limitation, a method utilizing trehalose was developed to allow reverse transcriptase to function at a higher temperature, relaxing secondary structures. Other methods were additionally developed to assist in the construction of clonal cDNA libraries. These include a biotin-based capture system to select for full length cDNA, a novel lambda phage vector that minimized biases when delivering cDNA into a plasmid, and an iterative strategy to enrich for cDNA that had yet to be sequenced.
Sequencing began in 1998 and progressed rapidly, producing 246 cDNA libraries that encompassed 21,076 cDNA clones across a large range of mouse cells and tissues. While this stage was largely successful, further limitations were encountered at the bioinformatic level. The sequenced cDNAs were annotated in a semi-automatic manner that utilized available databases (such as species homology and known protein motifs) to assign genes within a Gene Ontology (GO) framework. However, many novel sequences did not have meaningful matches when BLAST against gene databases.
After consulting Gerry Rubin, the organizer of the first genome annotation effort for Drosophila melanogaster, it became apparent that a robust system for annotation that incorporated computational prediction and manual curation was required for the novel sequences. Desiring input from experts in bioinformatics, genetics and other scientific fields, the RIKEN group organized the first FANTOM meeting.
FANTOM1.
To facilitate the annotation of the mouse cDNA clones, the RIKEN research group developed a web-based service called FANTOM+ prior to the first meeting. Users could search for motifs, view pre-computed sequence similarity scores, as well as query other public databases and integrate relevant annotations into the FANTOM database. The assignment and functional annotation of the genes required multiple bioinformatic tools and databases. Predominant tools included BLASTN/BLASTX, FASTA/FASTY, DECODER, EST-WISE and HMMER, while both nucleic acid and protein databases such as SwissProt, UniGene and NCBI-nr were utilized. Concurrently, a collaboration with the Mouse Genome Informatics group (MGI) allowed the RIKEN researchers to establish a validated set of clones that were identical between the two databases.
Armed with computational methodologies and over 20,000 cDNA sequences, the RIKEN group organized the first FANTOM meeting in Tsukuba City from August 28 to September 8, 2000. A diverse group of international scientists were recruited to discuss strategies and execute the annotation of the RIKEN clones. The assembled computational procedures allowed for sequence comparison and domain analysis to assign putative function using GO terms. Redundancy of the cDNA clones presented a challenge, requiring clustering strategies and referral to the MGI validation set to identify unique clones. The RIKEN set of clones was eventually reduced to 15,295 genes, although this was cautiously considered an overestimation.
Central to the curation efforts was the creation of the RIKEN definition. This provided a hierarchical and systematic means to assign functions to the clones based upon known genes, placing priority on previously established or well-curated knowledge. The hierarchical nature of the classification allowed for consistency when a sequence was highly similar to multiple different genes. Importantly, if no sequence similarity was found, the definition assigned putative function based upon predicted protein motif signatures, coding potential and matches to expressed sequence tag (EST) databases. Only in the absence of any predicted or representative similarity would a clone be considered ‘unclassifiable.’
The collected efforts of RIKEN/FANTOM resulted in a 2001 Nature publication. The results included the assignment of the 21,076 cDNA clones to 4,012 GO terms, identification of novel mouse genes and protein motifs, detection of likely alternative spliceforms, and the discovery of mouse genes orthologous to human disease genes. Additionally, the first sequenced human genome was published a week later and incorporated FANTOM’s results to predict the number of human genes.
FANTOM2.
Having established and improved upon the protocols for full-length cDNA library generation, the RIKEN group continued to add to the FANTOM collection. Modifications to their methods allowed for further selection of rare and long transcripts, enabling identification of cDNA over 4kb in length. The second FANTOM meeting occurred May 2002 - by then the number of cDNA clones had increased by 39,694 to a total of 60,770.
One insight gained from FANTOM1 was that alternative polyadenylation was common in the mouse transcriptome, meaning that 3’-end clustering led to extensive redundancy. To address this, additional sequencing of the 5’-end was performed to identify unique clones. The FANTOM2 publication contributed a substantial addition of novel protein coding transcripts. Arguably the most notable result of FANTOM2 was that efforts to select for long and rare transcripts had revealed a significant amount of non protein-coding RNA.
Again, the FANTOM collection proved to be a fruitful resource. The non-coding RNA were identified as antisense RNA and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), poorly understood classes of regulatory RNA. The first published sequence of the mouse genome utilized the annotations established by FANTOM. Other efforts were able to describe entire protein families, such as the G protein-coupled receptors.
FANTOM3.
An ultimate goal of FANTOM is to establish gene networks that capture the regulatory interactions of transcription, and to differentiate these interactions by cell type or state. To this extent, it was realized that the polymorphic nature of the 5'-end of sequences would require extensive mapping. Characterizing transcription start sites (TSSs) would allow identification of promoters and differentiation of their usage between cell types. This also meant further developments in sequencing methods were needed. While full length mouse cDNAs continued to be generated, the RIKEN-led researchers established Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE), a technique that would drive much of their future work.
Development of CAGE.
CAGE was a continuation of the concepts developed for FANTOM1 - and used extensively in the following projects - for capturing 5' mRNA caps. Unlike previous efforts to generate full length cDNA, CAGE examines fragments, or tags, that are 20-27 in length. This provided an economical and high-throughput means of mapping TSSs, including promoter structure and activity.
The general steps are as follows: cDNA is reverse transcribed from mRNA using random or oligo dT primers. The cap trapper method is then employed to ensure selection of full length cDNA. This entails adding biotin to the 5' cap, and subsequent capture with streptavidin beads after an RNase digestion step to remove single stranded RNA that has not hybridized to cDNA. Following cap trapping, the cDNA is separated from the RNA-cDNA hybrid. A double-stranded CAGE linker that is also biotinylated is ligated to the 5' end of the cDNA, and the second strand of the cDNA is synthesized. This resulting dual stranded DNA is digested with the Mme1 endonuclease, cutting the CAGE linker and producing a 20-27bp CAGE tag. A second linker is added to the 3'-end and the tag is amplified by PCR. Finally, the CAGE tags are released from the 5' and 3' linkers. The tags can then be sequenced, concatenated or cloned. At the time, CAGE was carried out using the RISA 384 capillary sequencer that had been previously established by RIKEN.
Discoveries.
The development of CAGE gave rise to a number of milestone findings. Importantly, RNA was found to be much more abundant in the mammalian transcriptome than previously thought, accompanied with the realization that the genome was pervasively transcribed. 
Combining the methods of CAGE, gene identification signatures, and gene signature cloning, the ‘transcriptional landscape’ of the mammalian genome was mapped, characterizing the pattern of transcription control signals and the transcripts they generate. It was discovered that there are many more transcripts than the estimated 22,000 genes in the mouse genome, and that many of these transcriptional units have alternative promoters and polyadenylation sites.
Furthermore, it was discovered that ‘transcriptional forests’, clusters of transcripts that share common expression regions and regulatory events, are separated by ‘transcription deserts,’ and make up ~63% of the genome. A jointly released publication found that many of the transcripts in these forests show antisense transcription, and that most sense/antisense pairs show concordant regulation. Another notable result showed that many non-coding RNAs are dynamically expressed, with many being initiated in 3’ untranslated regions, and that they are positionally conserved across species.
The third milestone paper to come out of FANTOM3 investigated mammalian promoter architecture and evolution. It established two classes of mammalian promoters. The first are TATA box-enriched promoters, with well defined transcriptional start sites. These promoters are evolutionary conserved and are more commonly associated with tissue-specific genes. The second and more common class of promoters, broad CpG rich promoters, are plastic, evolvable, and expressed in a wide range of cells and tissues. This study also demonstrated that CpG-rich promoters may be bidirectional (produce sense-antisense pairs), and are highly susceptible epigenetic control and are thus a potential component of adaptive evolution.
The meeting for FANTOM3 occurred in September, 2004. A collection of satellite publications that spawned from FANTOM3 were published in PLoS Genetics. They include further work on promoter properties, exon length and pseudo-messenger RNA.
FANTOM4.
The rise of next-generation sequencing was significantly beneficial to the advancement of CAGE technology. Using the Roche-454 sequencer, the FANTOM group developed deepCAGE, increasing the throughput of CAGE to more than a million tags per sample. At these depths, researchers could now start constructing networks of gene regulatory interactions. The FANTOM4 meeting took place December, 2006.
While previous FANTOM projects examined a range of cell types, FANTOM4's purpose was to deeply interrogate the dynamics driving cellular differentiation. Analysis was confined to a human THP-1 cell line, providing time course data of a monoblast becoming a monocyte. DeepCage resolved TSSs at single-nucleotide resolution, pinpointing where transcription factors (TFs) bind. By monitoring time-dependent gene expression changes as cells differentiated, inference was provided for which regulatory motifs are predictive of expression changes, time dependency of TF activity, and TF target genes. These efforts resulted in a transcriptional regulatory network, demonstrating that the differentiation process is highly complex and driven by a great magnitude of TFs enacting both positive and negative regulatory interactions.
FANTOM4 also increased our understanding of retrotransposon transcription and transcriptional initiation RNAs (tiRNAs). Retrotransposons contribute to repetitive elements in mammalian genomes and can affect multiple biological processes - like genomic evolution - as well as structures, such as alternative promoters and exons. It was demonstrated that retrotransposons are expressed in a cell and tissue specific manner, and approximately 250,000 previously unknown retrotransposon-driven TSSs were identified.
It was discovered that retrotransposons can influence mammalian transcription and transcriptional regulation of both coding and non-coding RNAs in various tissues. Further efforts found 
a genomically and evolutionary widespread new class of RNAs, called transcription initiation RNAs (tiRNA). This species of RNA are relatively tiny (~18 nucleotides long) and are typically found downstream of TSSs of CpG rich promoters. tiRNAs are low in abundance and are associated with highly expressed genes, as well as RNA polymerase II binding and TSSs. More recent work has shown that tiRNs may be able to modulate epigenetic states and local chromatin architecture. However, it possible that these tiRNAs do not have a regulatory role and are simply a byproduct of transcription.
Following these initial findings, an atlas of combinatorial transcriptional regulation in mouse and humans was published by the RIKEN researchers. This work demonstrated that transcriptional complexes can interact within a network to control tissue identity/cell state, and that these networks are often dominated by ‘facilitator' transcription factors which are broadly expressed across tissues/cells. It was found that about half of the measured regulatory interactions were conserved between mouse and human. FANTOM4 led to numerous satellite papers, investigating topics like promoter architecture, miRNA regulation and genomic regulatory blocks.
FANTOM5.
The fifth round of FANTOM aimed to provide insight into the regulatory landscape of the transcriptome across as many cell states as possible. It continues to be a relevant resource of shared data. The project consisted of two phases: the first focused on steady state cells, while the second focused on temporal data. Advancements in next generation sequencing were leveraged to achieve FANTOM5’s great breadth, with single molecule sequencing allowing single base pair resolution of TSS activity from as little as 100 ng of RNA. Samples was collected from every human organ, as well as over 200 cancer lines, 30 time courses of cellular differentiation, mouse development time courses, and over 200 primary cell types. In total, 1,816 human and 1,1016 mouse samples were profiled across both phases.
While similar to the ENCODE Project, FANTOM5 differs in two key ways. First, ENCODE utilized immortalised cell lines, while FANTOM5 focused on primary cells and tissues, which are more reflective of the actual biological processes responsible for maintaining cell type identity. Second, ENCODE utilized multiple genomic assays to capture the transcriptome and epigenome. FANTOM5 focused solely on the transcriptome, relying on other published work to infer features like cell type as defined by chromatin status. The FANTOM5 meeting took place October, 2011.
Phase 1.
The first phase of FANTOM5 involved taking ‘snapshots’ of a wide range of steady state cell types using CAGE profiling across 975 human and 399 mouse samples. This initial effort resulted in two Nature papers -
one describing the mammalian promoter landscape and the other describing active enhancers. Together, they provide an atlas of promoters, enhancers and TSSs across diverse cell types, acting as a ‘baseline’ for studying the complex landscape of transcription regulation. Specifically, single molecule CAGE profiles were generated using a HeliScope sequencer across 573 human primary cell samples, 128 mouse primary cell samples, 250 cancer cell lines, 152 human post-mortem tissues and 271 mouse developmental tissue samples.
A new method to identify the CAGE peaks was developed, called decomposition peak analysis. CAGE tags are clustered by proximity, followed by independent component analysis to decompose the peaks into non-overlapping regions. An enrichment step is applied to ensure the peaks correspond to TSSs, and external data of EST, histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation marks and DNase hypersensitivity sites are used to support that the peaks are genuine TSSs.
A key finding showed that the typical mammalian promoter contains multiple TSSs with differing expression patterns across samples. This implied that these TSSs are regulated separately, despite being within close proximity. Ubiquitously expressed promoters had the highest conservation in their sequences, while cell-specific promoters were less conserved. A further prominent result suggested that enhancer-derived RNA (eRNA) are transcribed in a cell/tissue specific manner, reflective of the activity of that enhancer.
Phase 2.
While the first phase was focused on a steady state representation of cell states, the second phase looked to explore the dynamic process of transitioning cell states through the use of time course data. Again, CAGE was employed - this time over 19 human and 14 mouse time courses covering a range of cell types and biological stimuli that represented 408 distinct time points. This included the differentiation of stem cell or committed progenitor cells towards their terminal fates, as well as fully differentiated cells responding to growth factors or pathogens.
Unsupervised clustering was performed to identify a set of distinct response classes, examining patterns in expression fold changes compared to time 0. In this manner, the expression of enhancers, TF promoters and non-TF promoters were generalized on a temporal scale of the first 6 hours of the time-course. Generally, the earliest response of the cells occurred at enhancers, with eRNA concentrations peaking as early as 15 minutes after time 0. Even in the classes that represent ‘later’ responses, enhancers tended to activate before proximal promoters. Variability was seen in the persistence of this activation - some enhancers rapidly returned to baseline after the burst at 15 minutes, while others persisted after promoter activation. Together, this is suggestive that eRNA may have differential roles in regulating gene activity.
Additional Work.
Aside from the typical sharing of data on the FANTOM database, FANTOM5 also introduced two bioinformatic tools for data exploration. ZENBU is a genome browser with additional functionality: users can upload BAM files of CAGE, short-RNA and ChIP-seq experiments and perform quality control, normalization, peak finding and annotation among visual comparisons. SSTAR (Semantic catalog of, samples, transcription initiations, and regulations) meanwhile allows exploration and searches of the FANTOM5 samples and their genomic features.
The bounty of data produced by FANTOM5 continues to provide a resource for researchers looking to explain the regulatory mechanisms that shape processes like development. Often CAGE data in a specific cell/tissue type is used in conjunction with further epigenomic assays - one such example describes the interplay of DNA methylation and CAGE-defined regulatory sequences during differentiation of a granulocyte.
Three years after introducing the enhancer and promoter atlases, the FANTOM group released atlases for lncRNAs and microRNAs (miRNA), incorporating FANTOM5 data. An overarching goal was to provide further insight into the earlier observation of pervasive transcription of the mammalian genome. The lncRNA work characterized 27,919 human lncRNA genes across 1,829 samples to stimulate research in the functional relevance of this poorly understood class of RNA. The results were suggestive that 69% of the identified lncRNA had potential functionality, although more evidence is required to comment on whether the remaining 31% are merely transcriptional ‘noise’ from spurious transcription initiation. The miRNA atlas identified 1,357 human and 804 mouse miRNA promoters and demonstrated strong sequence conservation between the two species. It was also demonstrated that primary miRNA expression could be used as a proxy for mature miRNA levels.
FANTOM6.
Currently underway, FANTOM6 aims to systematically characterize the role of lncRNA in the human genome. The biological function of these large (200+ nucleotides) and untranslated RNA is largely unknown. Based upon the few works that have examined lncRNA, it is believed that they are involved in regulating transcription, translation, post-translational modifications, and epigenetic marks. However, current knowledge of the extent and range of these putative regulatory interactions is rudimentary.
There are numerous challenges to address for this next rendition of FANTOM. In particular, lncRNAs are ill-defined - they lack conservation and vary greatly in size, ranging from 200 to over one million nucleotides in length. Unlike coding transcripts, which are found in the cytosol for translation, lncRNA are found primarily in the nucleus - a much more complex landscape of RNA. In general, lncRNA have lower expression levels than coding transcripts, but there is great variability in this expression which can be obscured by cell type or localization within the nucleus. Furthermore, functional classification lncRNAs remains hotly debated - it is unknown if lncRNAs can be grouped based on common function/mechanisms of action, or by active domains.
FANTOM has laid out a three pronged experimental strategy to explore these unknowns. A reference transcriptome and epigenome profile of different cell types will be constructed as a base line for each cell type. Next, using lncRNAs identified in previous publications, FANTOM5 data and further CAGE profiling, perturbation experiments will be conducted to evaluate changes in cellular molecular phenotype. Lastly, complementary technology will be used to functionally annotate/classify a selected subset of lncRNAs. These techniques will be aimed at elucidating lncRNA secondary structure, their association to proteins and chromatin, and mapping long range interactions of lncRNA throughout the genome.

Ricky Vargas

Victorico "Ricky" P. Vargas (born February 24, 1952) is a Filipino executive who served as the 10th President of the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) from March 5, 2018 after winning over Jose Cojuangco Jr. in a court-ordered elections held on February 23, 2018 until his resignation on June 18, 2019.
He is also the President of the Association of Boxing Alliances in the Philippines (ABAP) and the chairman of the Philippine Basketball Association Board of Governors for the 2017–18 season.
At PLDT, Vargas is currently served as the Head of the company's Business Transformation Group.
Education.
Vargas studied at Ateneo de Manila University and the University of Santo Tomas. He is a holder of a bachelor's degree in psychology.
Career.
Sports administration.
He served as the Philippine Basketball Association chairman of the board of governors since 2017 representing TNT KaTropa as its team governor, and the president of Association of Boxing Alliances in the Philippines, the NSA for Boxing in the Philippines. He is also the former Vice Chairman of the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP) until 2016.
Philippine Olympic Committee.
Election.
Ricky Vargas first attempted to run for the position of Philippine Olympic Committee President in 2016, challenging then incumbent president, Jose "Peping" Cojuangco Jr. However his candidacy, along with Abraham Tolentino's who was vying for chairmanship, for the November 2016 elections were rejected after the sport's body commission on election which was led by Francisco Elizalde ruled them ineligible for being not being "active member". Vargas, who only attended in one general assembly of the POC, argued that being an active member does not equate to physical presence in the POC's general assembly. He attempted to have the November 2016 elections postponed by the Pasig Regional Trial Court to allow for dialogue between his camp and Cojuangco's but failed. Cojuangco secured a fourth term unopposed in the 2016 elections.
The Pasig court later ruled the results of the 2016 elections for the post of president and chairman null and void, said that the commission on elections cannot restrict or qualify the eligibility criteria of being an "active member", and ordered and election with Vargas and Tolentino as candidates to be held on February 23, 2018. An extraordinary meeting was held in February where the general assembly agreed to hold elections and a commissions on elections was formed which was also led by Francisco Elizalde. Given the latter fact, Vargas and Tolentino anticipated that they will be disqualified again though Elizalde allowed the two to run to avoid being cited in contempt by court despite the election head's view that the two are ineligible.
Vargas secured a 24–15 victory over Cojuangco for the post of POC President ending the latter's long tenure. Vargas officially began his term on March 5, 2018 when he took his oath before Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in the Malacañang Palace. The first board meeting under Vargas' tenure was held the day after where his predecessor turned over the POC flag to Vargas.
Tenure.
Vargas had to work with a POC board, which is a holdover from his predecessor's administration and had to face issues such as continued unsettled leadership disputes within numerous member National Sports Associations, status of some the POC's members, and reform of the POC By-Laws and Constitution. He also became one of the key figures behind the organization of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games.
Almost a year after Vargas' election, Vargas reportedly was not content on the way the POC is being run and was aiming to make the POC as a "more transparent, more honest, and less political organization". He also credits his deputy, Abraham Tolentino for his role in his administration. Vargas has expressed preference to have Tolentino's presence in board meetings noting his experience as a politician.
Vargas' organization of the games was put into question particularly the incorporation of the Philippine SEA Games Organizing Committee (PHISGOC) Foundation as the organizing body of the regional games without prior approval of the POC board. The majority of its members believed the foundation to be a different entity than the ad hoc committee agreed upon by the board in 2017. It was also alleged that there is was an overpricing of supplies provided by Asics, the official outfitter for athletes representing the Philippines in the Southeast Asian Games.
There were allegations that there was an effort to remove Vargas from his position as president. His predecessor, Peping Cojuangco is often associated with such but has said he is not interested of the presidency and has expressed support for his administration.
The International Olympic Committee has urged Vargas to meet with the board to address the issues raised against him. Vargas convened a meeting with the board on June 18, 2019 where he filed his resignation as president. He was succeeded by First Vice President Joey Romasanta.
Personal life.
He is the grandson of Jorge B. Vargas, who served as president of POC's predecessor, Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation.

100 Days My Prince

100 Days My Prince () is a 2018 South Korean television series starring Do Kyung-soo and Nam Ji-hyun. The series aired on tvN from September 10 to October 30, 2018, every Monday and Tuesday at 21:30 (KST). It is the eleventh highest-rated Korean drama in cable television.
Synopsis.
Lee Yul is the king's nephew who enjoys spending his days playing instead of studying. He enjoys playing with the peasant children alongside his best friend and guardian, Dong-joo. One day, as he is playing with the peasant children where they play the villains, Yul uses his status to punish the children by beating them up, oblivious that his actions are hurting them. The children could not object to this treatment due to Yul's status. A girl, Yoon Yi-seo intervenes and chides Yul for his cruel actions. Like Yul, Yi-seo is from a noble family, but is kind, smart and compassionate. Yul instantly develops a crush on Yi-seo, and this causes him to change to become more studious in order to impress her. Yi-seo's father is a general and the right-hand man of the king.
However, Yul's father is an ambitious man who is jealous of his brother, the king, and vies for the throne. Scheming with another ambitious man, Kim Cha-eon, they plot to overthrow the current king, with the promise that Cha-eon will be handsomely rewarded. One night, Kim Cha-eon begins the coup which sees the king and all his men and allies ruthlessly murdered, including Yi-seo's father. While fatally injured, Yi-seo's father instructs his elder son Seok-ha to take Yi-seo and run away, as Cha-eon is determined to wipe out the entire family. As Cha-eon is about to deal the killing blow, Yul, who has been witnessing the whole thing, comes out from his hiding to stop Cha-eon, threatening that he will report this matter to his father. Cha-eon then carries Yul back to his father' mansion and it is then made known that he has been conspiring with Cha-eon for the whole thing all along, shocking Yul. Yul is removed from the scene and the coup is completed successfully. Due to this, Yul's father is crowned as the new king and Cha-eon becomes the vice-premier. Yul automatically assumes the title of Crown Prince, and is further shocked on the coronation day with the news of his mother's "accidental death". Despite the new king's surprise at the news, it becomes clear that the vice-premier will be the person who has the most power and control of the new reign. Yul bitterly resents his new position as the Crown Prince of Joseon.
Sixteen years later, Yul has grown up to be a cold and unlikable crown prince. Due to the trauma of his past, Yul is also very smart and skilled in the martial arts. His father is now remarried to the new queen who dislikes him and wants the Crown Prince title for her own son while he himself is married to Kim So-hye, who is Vice-premier Kim's daughter. Despite the marriage, Yul still longs for Yi-seo, even though he believes that Yi-seo was killed. This causes him to despise the crown princess and her father and his constant avoidance of consummating the marriage, despite the various schemes in place to ensure the consummation takes place. At the same time, a drought happens in Joseon and people begin to blame Yul and his refusal to consummate the marriage as the reason. Annoyed, Yul orders all the singles in the nation to be married off in a month to help alleviate the drought.
While en route to a rain ritual, Yul and his followers are ambushed by assassins arranged by Cha-eon, and he is almost killed. The crown princess was pregnant with another's child (later revealed to be Mu Yeon's, Hong-shim/Yi-Seo's brother) and the crown prince's assassination attempt was to escape from her predicament. His childhood friend and guardian, Dong-joo, forces them to switch their garments, essentially luring the attackers away from Yul. Dong-joo is subsequently killed and falls into the river, the attackers did not get to see his face and thus believed that it is Yul. Meanwhile, Yul gets shot with an arrow on his chest while on the run, and accidentally knocks his head, becoming unconscious. When he wakes up, he has already lost his memory.
Yi-seo, who managed to escape unscathed in the coup years ago, has been adopted by a commoner man and now lives undercover as a peasant girl named Hong-shim in Songjoo Village. It is her adoptive father who found the terribly wounded Yul and nurses him back to consciousness. The fate of her brother Seok-ha is unknown, as they separated after Seok-ha buried her under a stack of leaves and ran away to lure Cha-eon's people who were hunting them in the woods. Before separating, they promised to wait for each other at a bridge every 15th of the month. While Yi-seo goes to the bridge as promised without fail, it has been sixteen years since the separation and she is beginning to lose hope that her brother is still alive.
As a single woman, Hong-shim is also subjected to the crown prince's marriage decree and she happens to be the oldest single woman in the village. Due to the imbalance number of single men and women, Hong-shim finds herself the only one without a pair. Instead, she receives an offer to become the concubine of a lecherous nobleman. Hong-shim refuses because she says that she is already betrothed to a man named Won-deuk who is serving in the military and has no intention of being the man's fifth wife. The deadline for the decree passes by and since Hong-shim is still unmarried, she is subjected to the punishment of 100 floggings. To save her, her father takes advantage of Yul's amnesia. A very skeptical Yul is told that he is Hong-shim's betrothed, Won-deuk, a man whom her father had recommended but whom she had never met.
Thus, Yi-seo and Yul get married while neither of them are aware of each other's true identities.
The rest of the story follows how the prince seems very strange to the commoner's lifestyle and is initially considered a good-for-nothing-husband by the villagers. However, his skills of reading, writing and martial arts remain which impresses Hong-shim and the villagers. He eventually returns to the palace and regains his memories of Yi-seo later and the two reunite again.

The documentary features the voice of actor Michael Cera reading various excerpts from Shandling's diaries and includes interviews with: 
Production.
On February 6, 2017, it was reported that Judd Apatow was developing a documentary on his mentor and friend Garry Shandling. A day later, Apatow made a public plea, via his official Twitter account, for anyone with photographs, videos, or information about Shandling to reach out to him. 
On January 11, 2018, it was announced at the annual Television Critics Association's winter press tour that cable network HBO had acquired the documentary and planned to premiere it in two parts on March 26 and 27, 2018.
Release.
Marketing.
On February 21, 2018, HBO released the first trailer for the film. A week later, the official poster was released as well.
Premiere.
On March 14, 2018, the series held its official premiere at Avalon Hollywood in Los Angeles, California. The event was attended by various celebrities including Bob Saget, Kevin Nealon, Vanessa Bayer, Kathy Griffin and Regis Philbin.
Reception.
Critical response.
"The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling" has been met with a positive response from critics. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 93% approval rating with an average rating of 8.4 out of 10, based on 15 reviews. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the season a score of 90 out of 100 based on 9 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".
In a positive review, "Newsday"s Verne Gay gave the film four out of four stars and said, "Diaries is for Shandling fans, certainly, but it’s especially for any kid who might want to become a comic, or write for TV or get into this industry. "Zen Diaries" is a nearly five-hour-long master’s degree in “the business,” and also a sober, clear-eyed view of the risks as much as the rewards." His ultimate summation of his opinion of the film reads, "Brilliant portrait of an iconic comic, but an especially moving and human one, too." Offering similar praise, Steve Greene of "IndieWire" gave the film a grade of "A-" and said, "As a tribute, a eulogy, and an appreciation, "The Zen Diaries" is a even-handed look at someone who sought to bring meaningful change into other people’s lives as he searched for that same sense of fulfillment himself. Even if the film didn’t actually include footage from a ceremony remembering and celebrating Shandling’s life, you’d feel like you were already part of one." In another enthusiastic critique, "The Hollywood Reporter"s Daniel Fienberg said, "Presented over two nights, but easy to digest in a single sitting, "Zen Diaries" is a worthwhile account of Shandling's career and evolving philosophy, an insightful exploration of stand-up comedy and the comedic voice, and a sad contemplation and reckoning from those Shandling left behind and those grappling with his legacy." In a one sentence "bottom line" abridgment of his review he writes that the film is, "Essential for Shandling fans, a superb introduction for neophytes."
Ratings.
Upon their premiere, part one of the documentary was viewed by 268,000 people and part two was viewed by 286,000 people.

Josefa Gurfinkel

Josefa Gurfinkel (; 2 May 1919 – 9 April 1997) was a Jewish Russian-born Soviet chess Woman International Master (1954).
Biography.
Her first trainer was Igor Bondarevsky. In 1939, she won Rostov Oblast Women's Chess Championship. In 1950, she shared 1st-2nd place in the Russian SFSR Women's Chess Championship, but lost additional match for title to Vera Tikhomirova. She was a member of the Russian SFSR team who won the Soviet Team Chess Championship in 1951. Josefa Gurfinkel participated in Moscow City Women's Chess Championship, where best result reached in 1954 when she shared 3rd-4th place. Josefa Gurfinkel participated in Women's Soviet Chess Championship nine times (1947—1968). Her best result was 2nd place in 1954 (tournament won Larisa Volpert). In 1955, Josefa Gurfinkel participated in the Women's World Chess Championship Candidates Tournament in Moscow and shared 15th-16th place with Krystyna Hołuj.

Ladies Man (album)

Ladies Man is an album by saxophonist Teddy Edwards which was recorded in 2000 and released on the HighNote label the following year.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Scott Yanow states "For this project, veteran tenor saxophonist Teddy Edwards performs ten songs named after women's names, including his own "Saskia." Despite the potentially gimmicky nature of the repertoire, the music is conventional hard bop ... this is an excellent outing, well worth exploring by straight-ahead jazz collectors"

Zafar Iqbal (poet)

Zafar Iqbal (; born 27 September 1932 or 1933) is an Urdu poet based in Okara, Punjab, Pakistan.
Early life and career.
Zafar Iqbal was born to an Arain family in Bahawalnagar, Punjab where his maternal grandparents lived. Then he received his basic early education in Okara, Punjab which is his hometown and later moved to Lahore for his college education.
His poetry is mainly in the genre of ghazal. The diction of his ghazal is entirely different from traditional Urdu poetry. He is a lawyer by profession, and regularly contributes articles to some Urdu newspapers.
In contrast to classical Poets, Zafar's poetry portrays "love" as scientific and physical rather than supernatural. Dr Tabassam Kaashmiri called him "Literature's renegade" of the 20th century. Former Chief Minister of Punjab (Pakistan), Hanif Ramay who was also a writer and a well-known literary critic called him a poet of a new tone and new concepts.
Besides being a poet, he has been a newspaper columnist for different newspapers for over 35 years. Considering that he also has been a professional lawyer for most of his adult life, those are not small accomplishments. He practised as an attorney, first in Okara and then in Lahore until 2003, when he had a heart bypass surgery and quit practicing law.
Zafar Iqbal has a son named Aftab Iqbal who is a newspaper columnist and a well-known TV anchor in Pakistan.

University of Nagano

, abbreviated as , is a co-educational 4-year public university located in Nagano, Nagano, Japan. It is the newest of the ten major universities in Nagano Prefecture. The University of Nagano consists of two campuses, named for their locations, Miwa Campus and Gocho Campus, respectively. Both campuses are open to the public.
The University of Nagano should not be confused with , a formerly private, public as of 2017, university located in Ueda, Nagano.
History.
The University of Nagano opened in April 2018. The school was first established by Nagano Prefecture as a women's school in 1929 before becoming a women's junior college in 1950. It became co-educational in 2004.
For several decades, plans regarding a transition to a 4-year university were both proposed and opposed, particularly by established local public and private universities. The main criticisms were the impending decline in the number of prospective students and the potential overlap in majors with other universities in the prefecture, while the main arguments for the transition to a 4-year university were the cultivation of businesses and young people within the prefecture and stemming the outflow of industry, talent, and tax money.
After the decision was made to transition to a 4-year university, the prefectural university foundation special committee was formed in September 2008 to lay groundwork for the university. The junior college officially began preparation to transition to a 4-year university in 2011 under the then-recently elected Nagano Prefectural Governor Shuichi Abe. The official name of the university and details about the entrance requirements and student intake were finalized and announced in March 2016. The English-language name of the university and the website were unveiled on 31 October 2016.
As a public prefectural university, its budget, deliberations, and current state of affairs are made public knowledge and continuously updated by the prefectural government. For the inaugural class of 2018, the percentage of students attending from within Nagano Prefecture is 58%, while the percentage of out-of-prefecture students is 42%.
The university is headed by former Sony President and chief operating officer, Kunitake Ando, and Keio University Professor Emeritus, Masumi Kindaichi, who is also the son of the famous Japanese linguist, Haruhiko Kindaichi, and grandson of Kyosuke Kindaichi.
Campuses.
The university consists of two campuses, which are both open to the public. They are named for their locations, and hence are called the Miwa Campus, near 
 and Gocho Campus, near , respectively. Each year they host two major events: Open Campus Days in July and August; and The University of Nagano School Festival in October.
Miwa Campus.
The main university campus in Miwa, near , was completed in 2018. It currently houses a complex which is over 10,610 square meters, not including the grounds. Built of native Nagano Prefecture lumber and other building materials, it boasts a natural geothermal air conditioning system, glass-walled classrooms and offices, a spacious cafeteria which is also open to the public on weekdays, and a library which is also open to the public on weekdays and Saturdays. The Miwa campus was built directly behind the Nagano Prefectural College campus, which was torn down in 2019.
Global Center.
The Global Center serves as the international affairs office for the university. This includes organizing the study abroad program, as well as providing materials and support, academic training, and opportunities for foreign language study. It has an office staffed by multi-lingual employees who are available for consultation by university students and faculty, as well as international students during their study in Japan.
Library.
The University of Nagano Library is a community accessible library, open to students, staff, and the general public, Monday-Saturday. The library was constructed using various wood and lumber materials from Nagano Prefecture. The library includes counters and tables for study as well as booths and rooms for individual or group study. In addition to its collection of Japanese books, the library includes a large collection of graded readers in English, newspapers and magazines, and offers access to online data bases including ProQuest, OPAC, CiNii, J-Stage, Webcat and JAIRO.
Gocho Campus.
The university dormitory and community campus in Gocho was built on the site of a decommissioned elementary school in the downtown area of Nagano. The Gocho community campus includes rentable kitchens, conference rooms, and a lecture hall.
Zozan Dormitory.
All first-year students are required to live in the centrally-located student dormitory to foster relationships between students and the community. The student dormitory system is highly unusual for a university in Japan. It is similar to dormitories which exist in overseas universities, such as in the United States. Each dorm room houses two students in a partitionable room, and a group of eight dorm rooms share a common living room, kitchen, eating, and study area.
Zozan Dormitory is named after the 19th Century Japanese rangaku, literally "Dutch learning", and by extension "Western learning") scholar, engineer, and politician Sakuma Shōzan who was born in (or Shinano Province) (present day Nagano Prefecture) during the Edo period.
The Center for Social Innovation Initiatives (CSI).
The Center for Social Innovation Initiatives (CSI), which aims to connect academia, industry, government, and the community, is also located in Gocho. The CSI focuses on developing solutions, products, and services for contemporary social problems, such as the declining birth rate, aging population, and environmental pressures, from a business perspective.
On 5 February 2019, the university signed a comprehensive cooperation agreement with the Nagano Prefectural government and Nihon Unisys on social innovation to solve regional issues.
Academics.
Faculties.
The university comprises two faculties and three departments:
Curriculum.
Unlike other universities in Japan, the university operates on a quarter system. Each academic year is divided into four-quarters instead of the traditional two semester system. In addition, each class period is 100 minutes in length instead of the typical 90-minute university class. Finally, many courses meet twice per week, compared to the more usual once per week schedule at other universities in Japan.
Eminent Speakers' Forum on Global Development.
The Eminent Speakers’ Forum on Global Development, which began in 2019, provides a series of English-language public lectures on global development. This Forum covers a range of topics and issues, including economics, finance, human development, regional integration, environment, climate change, and career development. Speakers have included Shinji Asanuma (Hitotsubashi University); Fernando Aldaba (Ateneo de Manila University); Emanuel Mori (former President of the Federated States of Micronesia); and Andrew Parker (regional Asian senior adviser at the United Nations Development Programme).
International Exchanges.
All students are required to study abroad as part of the general education curriculum. International partnerships and exchanges have been made with global institutions in the following locations:
English-language Education.
The university emphasizes both content education conducted in English and English-language education, including English for Academic Purposes and English for Specific Purposes. The "English Program for Global Mobility" (EPGM) is an intensive two-year course of study for all undergraduate students. It is designed to equip students with academic skills and prepare them for overseas study. All students are required to study abroad. English-language elective courses will also be offered by faculty members.
In 2020, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the EPGM launched a weekly English-language social for students and faculty on Zoom.
Self access language learning centers.
Located on the first floor of the Miwa Campus is the Media Plaza which is a learning commons with 2 CALL rooms, 10 individual CALL booths, group study areas equipped with whiteboards, 12 study desks, 16 semi-private and 10 private study carrels, and a resource library. The resource library has newspapers, magazines, DVDs, and TOEIC self-study materials. It also has brochures, maps, and information in foreign languages about destinations abroad and in Japan available.
The Global Language Table (GLT) is an unmoderated lunchtime language table, sponsored by a student circle and faculty adviser, to encourage peer learning and lifelong learning. In keeping with the ethos of the university and of self access language learning centers, the GLT promotes student-centered learning, learner autonomy, and self-directed learning. Attendees can chat freely about any topic in any foreign language. The university currently offers courses in Chinese, French, German, and Spanish. Special GLT events in 2018 and 2019 have included Korean, Tagalog, German, Spanish, Italian, French, Slovak, Czech, and Danish-speaking guests. In 2020, the GLT switched to an online format on Zoom with special guests from the UK, Trinidad, US, Jamaica, and the Netherlands.

Disappearance of Suzanne Lyall

On the night of March 2, 1998, Suzanne Lyall (born April 6, 1978), an undergraduate at the State University of New York at Albany, left her job at the Babbage's in Crossgates Mall in the nearby suburb of Westmere after the store had closed. She is believed to have taken a city bus from the mall back to the university's Uptown Campus, where a classmate has said she saw Lyall get off the bus at Collins Circle, a short walk from her dorm. She has never been seen again. 
The next morning Lyall was reported missing. That afternoon her credit card was used at a nearby convenience store's ATM to withdraw $20. According to her boyfriend, only she and he knew the PIN. He had a verified alibi for the time of her disappearance, but due to his later refusal to cooperate with the police they have been unable to completely rule him out as a suspect. A man who used the ATM around the same time has been ruled out. New York State Police continue to investigate the case. It has been the subject of an episode of the Investigation Discovery channel series "Disappeared".
Lyall's parents have become activists on behalf of the families of other missing persons, founding an organization called the Center for Hope to support those families. They were present when President George W. Bush signed "Suzanne's Law", enacted as part of the PROTECT Act of 2003, which raised the age at which local police must inform the National Crime Information Center of a missing person from 18 to 21. Five years later, he also signed into law the Suzanne Lyall Campus Safety Act, part of the Higher Education Opportunity Act, based on similar legislation the state passed the year after Suzanne disappeared, which requires college police departments to have plans for investigating missing-persons cases and serious crimes on campus. A "Suzanne's Law" passed by the New York State Senate several times, but not yet voted on in the State Assembly, would also increase the penalties for violent crimes on and near educational facilities should it become law.
Background.
Suzanne Lyall was born in Saratoga Springs, New York, in 1978, the youngest of Doug and Mary Lyall's three children. The family lived in nearby Ballston Spa; her two older siblings described her as "the darling of the family", a quiet girl who would run out of the shower with her hair still wet to write poetry in her notebook after inspiration struck her, and was a great fan of the Canadian power trio Rush. She showed an early interest in computers, even building some from scratch. After Suzanne graduated from Ballston Spa High School with honors in 1996, she first attended the State University of New York at Oneonta for a year, after which she transferred to SUNY Albany, since she felt the computer science courses at Oneonta were not sufficiently challenging.
Transferring to Albany brought her closer not only to her home but to her boyfriend Richard Condon, a fellow student several years her senior, whom she had started dating when they were both still in high school. He shared Suzanne's interest in computers; the two frequently chatted back and forth and he had set up her computer so he could access it from his. She supplemented her studies, and earned some income, through two jobs off-campus. One was at a computer company in Troy, the other at a Babbage's store in the Crossgates Mall, west of campus in the suburb of Westmere.
Suzanne called or emailed her parents, and/or Condon, almost daily. Mary Lyall recalls that the last time she actually spoke to her daughter, on March 1, 1998, Suzanne had complained about being low on cash and waiting for her next paycheck. However, she declined her mother's offer to lend her some money in the interim.
Disappearance.
In late February 1998, Suzanne's manager at Babbage's recalled that she had been stressed about an upcoming midterm exam, which she said she needed not only to pass but excel on. She took it the morning of March 2 and attended other classes until 4 p.m. After that, she went from the school's North Campus, where she lived in the Colonial Quad dorm, to her job at Babbage's. According to her manager, she felt she had "done OK" on the exam and was somewhat subdued. She worked there until the store closed at 9 p.m., then got on to a Capital District Transportation Authority bus back to campus around 9:20 p.m. The driver, who regularly worked that route, confirmed later that he had seen her board his bus.
However, he was not certain that he had seen her get off at the Collins Circle stop on campus, a short walk from her dorm. He could only say with certainty that she was not on the bus when he reached the end of the route downtown. A friend of Suzanne's says she saw her get off the bus there, though. It was approximately 9:45 p.m. She has never been seen again.
Investigation.
The next morning, March 3, Condon, who attended a different college in the Albany area, called Doug and Mary Lyall to tell them Suzanne had not returned to her dorm the night before and was missing. She usually phoned or emailed him after returning from work and had not answered his calls to her dorm room. They called the campus police to formally report her missing, and were told that brief absences were not uncommon for college students, so they should not worry as it was likely that she would soon reappear.
Despite assurances, the Lyalls did worry, as this behavior was unlike their daughter. "Suzie was not a risk-taker", her father said. "She didn't party or use alcohol or drugs". An officer who went to her next scheduled class did not see her. Her suitemates said that Suzanne did not return to her room on the night of March 2, and they would have heard her keys and fobs jingling as they normally did when she returned.
The Lyalls also called Suzanne's bank, who informed them that their daughter's debit card had been used to withdraw $20 from an ATM at a Stewart's Shops convenience store in Albany at approximately 4 p.m. Two days later, a delay Doug Lyall later criticized, the campus police agreed after Suzanne missed another midterm test, as well as her other scheduled classes, that her disappearance was not a typical case of a missing undergraduate and called in the New York State Police for assistance. The Lyalls and SUNY Albany put up a $15,000 reward for information. Fliers with Suzanne's picture were posted on campus and nearby.
ATM withdrawals.
In the first two weeks of the investigation, police looked into 270 leads and searched near Collins Circle, including the wooded area and Rensselaer Lake in the eastern end of the Albany Pine Bush just across Interstate 90 from that part of the campus. The ATM withdrawal drew particular attention. The Stewart's where it was located had a security camera but it focused on the area around the cashier and did not show the ATM, so it could not be determined who was using it at that time. A man who may have used the card at that time, wore a Nike baseball cap, and was sought as a possible witness or person of interest.
Whoever had used the card knew the correct PIN. Condon said that only he and Suzanne knew it. She also always withdrew exactly $20 anytime she went to the ATM, according to her parents.
Lyall's parents said that Stewart's, at the intersection of Central Avenue and Manning Boulevard southeast of the campus, was not in a part of the city that Suzanne frequented. The clerk on duty at the time did not recognize her. Police eventually located the man with the Nike cap, and came to believe he had nothing to do with the case, although they could not completely exclude him.
The bank also told the Lyalls and police that their records showed that Suzanne's card was used to make two withdrawals from different ATMs on the day she disappeared. One had been in the morning at a machine near the Collins Circle bus stop, the other was in the mall at about the time she would have arrived there for work. Both had been for $20, so it seemed likely that she had made them. But Mary Lyall could not imagine why her daughter would have made two withdrawals in one day.
Suspicions of foul play.
Investigators pondered a connection to a similar disappearance of another SUNY Albany undergraduate, Karen Wilson, who likewise had been last seen getting off a public bus away from campus almost 13 years before Suzanne, in March 1985. An intensive search at that time had yielded no evidence, and her case, too, remains unsolved . A convicted rapist who had violated parole and left the area around the time Suzanne disappeared was briefly considered a suspect, but police interviewed him after he was returned to New York from Illinois and excluded him.
Based on the bus driver's uncertainty as to whether Suzanne had indeed disembarked at Collins Circle, police also began considering the possibility that she might never have returned to campus that night. Some investigators even theorized that she might not even have gotten on the bus at all. In May, her Babbage's name tag was found about away from the bus stop, in the parking lot, opposite from the direction she would have walked if returning to her dorm. But it could not be determined how long it had been there, and police could recover no forensic evidence from it.
Another possibility came from a coworker of Suzanne's at the store. She told investigators that Suzanne had told her about a month before she disappeared that she believed she was being stalked by someone she did not know. However, the coworker also said Suzanne did not appear to be afraid of this person.
Police have never been able entirely to rule out Condon, Suzanne's boyfriend, as a suspect in the disappearance. Mary Lyall later told CBS News that her daughter had on several occasions tried to end the relationship, but after Condon became emotional she would stay with him. After the disappearance, he told police that Suzanne was his fiancée, a development in their relationship the Lyalls said Suzanne, who called or emailed them almost daily, had not informed them of.
Two weeks before Suzanne disappeared, Mary recalled, she and her daughter had been on a trip to see her own mother when Suzanne asked if they could stop at Condon's house, which was along their way. Suzanne said she wanted to give Condon a Valentine's Day card. While nothing unusual happened during the brief stop, Mary said in 2012, she wondered if her daughter had in fact given Condon a "Dear John letter" ending the relationship. Due to the increased tension she seemed to see in her daughter's life, she began wondering if Suzanne might have become involved with someone else; police have never found any evidence that she was.
Condon had an alibi for the time Suzanne disappeared: he was playing video games with a friend, and the friend confirmed this when asked by police. But after his initial conversations with police, Condon refused to take a lie detector test and told them he would be interviewed again only if his lawyer was present. He refused to answer questions from the media about the case in later years; his mother told CBS in 2010 that he had married and moved on with his life.
In 2005 a man named John Regan, who was facing trial for a 1993 kidnapping in Connecticut, was arrested after trying to abduct a female student at Saratoga Springs High School by pulling her into his van from the street near the school. Since Saratoga Springs is a short distance from Ballston Spa, the Lyalls' hometown, police and the family wondered if he might have been responsible for Suzanne's disappearance. Even after Regan was convicted of the attempted kidnapping in Saratoga, however, he refused to discuss the Lyall case with investigators.
Later efforts.
The case remains open, and the state police continue to follow up on any leads that come in. In 2012 the Investigation Discovery cable channel devoted an episode of "Disappeared", its series on missing person cases, to Suzanne's disappearance. "Her story struck us as compelling", executive producer Elizabeth Fischer said. "This is the story of a wholesome life of a college student who vanished".
Doug Lyall died in 2015; his wife continues both their activism and their search. Over the years, 75 psychics have contacted the Lyalls with tips. Many of them have involved water, suggesting that Suzanne is dead and her body has been submerged somewhere. While Mary Lyall has dismissed them, noting that there are so many bodies of water in the Capital District as to make that information too vague to be useful, she nevertheless told Schenectady's "Daily Gazette" in 2016 that she has persistently experienced "an odd feeling" any time she has driven across the Crescent Bridge, along U.S. Route 9 over the Mohawk River, between Albany and Ballston Spa. In June of that year, a reporter from the newspaper went along with her as a local firm that does high-tech mapping applied its technology to the river's bottom in that area; it has not been reported whether anything significant was found.
Parents' activism.
Within a year of their daughter's disappearance, Doug and Mary Lyall had begin lobbying for changes in New York law to address what they saw as shortcomings of the original investigation. From a victims' support group, they learned of a California couple who had successfully lobbied legislators to make similar changes after their daughter, Kristin Smart, had gone missing in 1996 from a college campus in that state. They reached out to state legislators, who sponsored a bill, formally known as the Campus Safety Act but referred to as "Suzanne's Law", that required colleges and universities in the state to have detailed plans for the investigation of violent felonies and missing persons cases that occurred on campus, as well as reporting the latter promptly to the state. It passed, and on April 6, 1999, Suzanne's 21st birthday, Governor George Pataki signed it into law, with institutions of higher learning required to be in compliance by the beginning of 2000.
The Lyalls then focused their efforts on getting federal law changed to increase the age at which local police must report missing persons to the National Crime Information Center from 17 to 21. In 2003, President George W. Bush signed into law the PROTECT Act of 2003, an omnibus bill of measures meant to protect children from various types of harm, in which had been included another "Suzanne's Law", making that change. It also allowed police departments to report those cases to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children as well, from which they could receive additional services like flyer and poster creation as well as age progression technology applied to images of the missing.
That same year the Lyalls were attending a conference at which other families of missing persons spoke. They were particularly struck by one woman's speech, and when they talked to her afterwards she told them "I could have laid in bed with a cover over my head for years but I decided to really get out there and talk about this". The couple decided to follow that example. Mary Lyall began speaking publicly about her experience, and she and Doug founded the Center for Hope, which in addition to disseminating information about missing persons and educating law enforcement about its increased responsibilities under the new laws provides support to the families of the missing.
The Lyalls continued their lobbying efforts, which in 2008 resulted in another federal law named for their daughter. The Suzanne Lyall Campus Safety Act enacted nationwide provisions similar to those in the 1999 New York state law. It also required that colleges and universities have in place policies that clearly delineate the role of campus, local and state police agencies in investigating a violent crime or disappearance on campus, in order to reduce the sort of "confusion and delays" that the Lyalls believed had hindered the investigation of Suzanne's disappearance during the days immediately afterward. Like the 2003 legislation, it was passed by being incorporated into a larger, related bill, the Higher Education Opportunity Act.
Another "Suzanne's Law" in the state legislature has not yet passed. State senator James Tedisco has, since he was a member of the Assembly in 1999, introduced a bill that would increase penalties for violent felonies that are committed on the premises of, or within of, any educational facility in the state, from day care centers to colleges. Companion bills in the State Senate, introduced by then-majority leader Joseph Bruno, passed that house every session until 2007, but Tedisco's bill never reached the floor of the Assembly even when he was that body's minority leader. He continues to work for the bill's passage.

ELEAGUE Major: Atlanta 2017, also known as ELEAGUE Major 2017 or Atlanta 2017, was the tenth " . It was organized by ELEAGUE and held in Atlanta, Georgia, United States from January 22 to 29, 2017. It featured sixteen professional teams from around the world. Eight teams directly qualified based on their top eight placement in the last major, ESL One Cologne 2016, while another eight teams qualified through the ELEAGUE Offline Major Qualifier. ELEAGUE Major was the third consecutive Major with a prize pool of $1,000,000.
The playoff stage consisted of eight teams. Astralis, Fnatic, Gambit Gaming, Natus Vincere, SK Gaming, and Virtus.pro were returning Legends. FaZe Clan and North were new Legends, replacing FlipSid3 Tactics and Team Liquid, who failed to make it past the group stage. The grand finals pitted Astralis, in its first ever final after nine playoff appearances, and Virtus.pro, which was in its second finals and looking for its second major title. Astralis had defeated Natus Vincere and Fnatic in the playoff stage, while Virtus.pro had beaten North and defending champions SK Gaming. In the third map of the best-of-three final, Astralis edged out Virtus.pro in the final round of regulation for its first major title.
Background.
" (CS:GO) is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Hidden Path Entertainment and Valve. It is the fourth game in the "Counter-Strike" series. In professional CS:GO, the Valve-sponsored are the most prestigious tournaments.
Entering the 2017 ELEAGUE Major, the two-time defending champion was SK Gaming, which won both MLG Columbus 2016 (as Luminosity Gaming) and ESL One Cologne 2016. SK was also the first non-European team to win a Major. At the time, Fnatic was the most decorated team, with three Majors, and SK Gaming was in second, with two.
Format.
The top eight teams from the ESL One Cologne 2016 ("Legends") were automatically invited to ESL One Cologne 2016. The remaining eight spots were filled by teams that advanced from the ELEAGUE Major Main Qualifier. The ELEAGUE Main Qualifier was a 16-team tournament consisting of the bottom eight teams from Cologne 2016, as well as eight teams promoted from four regional qualifiers. The top eight teams at the Main Qualifier then advanced to the Major as the "Challengers".
Unlike previous Majors, which used the GSL-format for group stages, this Major was the first to use the Swiss-system for group stages. The top eight teams at the end of the group stage advanced to the playoff stage. All playoff matches were best-of-three, single elimination.
Map pool.
The seven-map pool did not change from Cologne 2016. Before each best-of-one match in the group stage, teams alternated banning maps until five maps had been banned. One of the two remaining maps was randomly selected, and the team that that did not get a third ban then selected which side it wanted to start on. In all best-of-three series, each team first banned a map, leaving a five-map pool. Each team then chose a map, with the opposing team selecting which side they wanted to start on for their opponent's map choice. The two map picks were the first two maps in the best-of-three. The teams then each banned one more map, leaving one map remaining for the best-of-three decider if necessary.
Broadcast talent.
ELEAGUE retained much of the broadcast team that had been featured in ELEAGUE Season 1 and Season 2.

Major Qualifier.
Like the previous Majors, there was a single Main Qualifier after four Minors, or regional qualifiers. The bottom eight teams from ESL One Cologne 2016 received automatic bids to the Main Qualifier. Two teams each from the Asia, North America, Europe, and CIS Minors also competed in the Main Qualifier.
Regional Qualifiers.
The final four teams from each qualifier are shown below: two from each moved on to the Main Qualifier.
Main Qualifier.
The Main Qualifier was a sixteen-team Swiss-system tournament in which, after the first round, teams only played other teams with the same win-loss record. Each match was best-of-one, and no team played another team twice. All teams played until they had either won or lost three games: any team with three wins advanced to the Major, and any team with three losses was eliminated.
First round seeding was determined by the following:
GODSENT and FaZe Clan were the first teams to advance to the Major. The next three teams to move on were mousesports, OpTic Gaming, and Team Dignitas. In the fifth round of matches, the final teams to move on were Team EnVyUs, G2 Esports, and HellRaisers.

Teams competing.
The top eight teams from ESL One Cologne 2016 (Legends) were joined by the eight teams from the main qualifier (Challengers).

Perhaps the biggest change was Team Dignitas and the Philadelphia 76ers and their players and coach mutually parting ways and the organizations announced plans to build a North American roster; in addition, it plans to invest into positions such as a sports psychologist and a nutritionist. The coach, Casper "ruggah" Due, said, despite "competitive offers," the roster decided to leave the team. Roughly a day later, the team is reported to sign with the Danish football (soccer) club F.C. Copenhagen and the Denmark-based Nordisk Film and officially signed on January 3, 2016. The team will be called North. Team Dignitas (now North) signed Emil "Magiskb0Y" Reif and releases Jesper "tenzki" Mikalski after ESL One Cologne 2016.
Prior to the major, changes took place. GODSENT acquired Robin "flusha" Rönnquist, Jesper "JW" Wecksell, and Freddy "KRiMZ" Johansson from Fnatic, who acquired Jonas "Lekr0" Olofsson and Simon "twist" Eliasson, so GODSENT acquired the Legends spot from Fnatic. However, KRiMZ rejoined Fnatic while Lekr0 rejoined GODSENT, giving the Legends spot back to Fnatic. Fnatic used John "wenton" Eriksson to fill in its last spot, but is soon replaced by Joakim "disco doplan" Gidetun.
Natus Vincere acquired Oleksandr "s1mple" Kostyliev from Team Liquid and released Danylo "Zeus" Teslenko. Meanwhile, Zeus went on to join Gambit Gaming with Abay "HObbit" Khasenov and Gambit released Ivan "spaze" Obrezhan and Dmitry "hooch" Bogdanov. Team Liquid then signs the Danish player Jacob "Pimp" Winneche.
FlipSid3 Tactics released Oleksandr "Shara" Hordieiev and sign Denis "electronic" Sharipov.
Astralis agreed to release Finn "karrigan" Andersen and sign Lukas "gla1ve" Rossander as in game leader. karrigan is then signed by FaZe Clan. In addition, FaZe Clan replaced Ricardo "fox" Pacheco with Aleksi "allu" Jalli.
mousesports release Johannes "nex" Maget and sign the Czech AWPer Tomáš "oskar" Šťastný from the HellRaisers roster. However, due to internal problems, oskar is benched and mousesports sign the Spanish player Christian "loWel" Antoran, who came from PENTA Sports.
Damian "daps" Steele announces his departure from OpTic Gaming and bring back recently released OpTic player Peter "stanislaw" Jarguz. OpTic then acquire Tarik "tarik" Celik from Counter Logic Gaming to fill up its five-man roster.
Team EnVyUs release Timothée "DEVIL" Démolon and sign Christophe "SIXER" Xia.
SK Gaming benched Lincoln "fnx" Lau following internal problems. The team brought in fox as a temporary replacement and moved fnx to the substitute role.

Group stage.
The group stage was a sixteen-team Swiss-system format in which, after the first round, teams only played other teams with the same win-loss record. Each match was best-of-one, and no team played another team twice. All teams played until they had either won or lost three games: any team with three wins advanced to the playoff stage, and any team with three losses was eliminated.
First round seeding was determined by the following:
In the first round, first seeds played a randomly drawn fourth seed, and second seeds played a randomly drawn third seed. After this round, teams were randomly drawn against other teams with the same record (e.g., 1–0 teams against 1–0 teams, 0–1 teams against 0–1 teams). The eight teams to win three (out of a possible five) games were granted "Legend" status and an automatic invitation to the next Major.
This was the first Major in which GODSENT players Robin "flusha" Rönnquist and Jesper "JW" Wecksell did not advance to the playoffs, after losing to North in the fifth round and placing 9th. They had maintained Legend status with Fnatic prior to transferring to GODSENT.

<doc id="56664677" url="?curid=56664677" title="National Wake">
National Wake

National Wake was a multiracial punk rock band in South Africa in the late 1970s that emerged from a series of jam sessions in an underground commune. They were created in protest at the apartheid regime. They were South Africa's first multiracial punk band.
History.
Ivan Kadey, an architecture student in Johannesburg at the time, formed the band with brothers Gary and Punka Khoza. Ivan Kadey was a Jewish orphan born in Johannesburg. Gary, Punka, and their family were forcibly moved to Soweto township under the policy of apartheid. The band was later joined by guitarist Steve Moni. 
National Wake were formed in 1978, two years after the student inspired Soweto uprising. National Wake split in 1982 just after putting out their solitary release in 1981 which sold approximately 700 copies before being withdrawn under government pressure.
National Wake is covered in the Punk in Africa documentary.
Style.
National Wake played punk, reggae, and tropical funk, but also incorporating two-tone ska and African rhythms. The band's signature tune "International News" decries state censorship and the atrocities of the Angolan War of Independence.National Wake's existence was a subversive threat to the South African status quo, a policeman cynically suggested that they could make more money as a band playing in exile. The music has a hint of third wave ska with influences of the Clash.
Czech Radio described the band as "perhaps the most dissident music scene of the 20th century: a multi-racial punk band in a fascist police state".
Discography.
National Wake released just one album in 1981. It sold approximately 700 copies before being withdrawn under government pressure. Their full body of work was released as "Walk in Africa 1979-81" by Light in the Attic record label.

<doc id="56664790" url="?curid=56664790" title="Tranquil (horse)">
Tranquil (horse)

Tranquil (1920 – October 1938) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. She showed considerable promise as a two-year-old when she won one race and finished second in the Gimcrack Stakes. In the following season she was one of the best horses in Britain, scoring classic victories in the 1000 Guineas and St Leger Stakes as well as winning four other races including the Jockey Club Cup and Newmarket Oaks. he won once in 1924 before her racing career was ended by injury. She made no impact as a broodmare.
Background.
Tranquil was a "big, raking" bay mare bred in England by her owner Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby. During her racing career she was trained by George Lambton at the Stanley House stable near Newmarket, Suffolk.
Her sire Swynford was an outstanding racehorse who won the St Leger in 1910 and the Eclipse Stakes in the following year. He was even better as a breeding stallion with his other offspring including Blandford, Saucy Sue, Challenger and Sansovino. Tranquil's dam Serenissima was an exceptional broodmare whose other descendants included Sickle, Hyperion, and Pharamond.
Racing career.
1922: two-year-old season.
In the Gimcrack Stakes at York Racecourse Tranquil finished second, beaten four lengths by Town Guard, who was regarded as the season's best juvenile colt. In October at Newmarket Racecourse she recorded her only victory of the season when she defeated two opponents to win the Bretby Stakes. She also finished fourth behind My Lord, Americus Boy and the Aga Khan Teresina in the Linton Stakes and was unplaced in her other race.
1923: three-year-old season.
Tranquil began her second season by winning the Berkshire Handicap over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in April. On 4 May the filly started 5/2 favourite in a sixteen-runner field for the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket. Ridden by Ted Gardner she won the race "comfortably" by one and a half lengths from the Queen Mary Stakes winner Cos with a length back to Shrove in third. The second and third were both owned by the Aga Khan. After the race one British writer described her as the best filly since Sceptre.
On 8 of June Tranquil started favourite for the 145th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. She was unable to obtain a clear run in the straight and came home fourth behind Brownhylda, Shrove and Teresina. Later that month she finished unplaced behind Paola in the Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot. The gound at Newmarket was unusually hard and dry in the late summer of 1923, and Lord Derby decided to send the filly temporarily to the stable of Jack Joels trainer Charles Morton at Wantage. Tranquil made little impact when she returned to the track at York in August, finishing down the field behind the Derby winner Papyrus in the Duke of York Stakes.
On 13 September at Doncaster Racecourse Tranquil was ridden by Tommy Weston in the 148th running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs and started at odds of 11/1 in a thirteen-runner field. Papyrus started favourite while the other fancied runners included Teresina, Parth, Ellangowan and Doric. After tracking the early leaders Tranquil drew alongside Papyrus in the straight, before pulling away to win by two lengths.
On her next appearance Tranquil ran in the Jockey Club Stakes over fourteen furlongs at Newmarket on 4 October for which she started the 1/3 favourite and finished third behind the colts Inkerman and Legality. On 1 November at Newmarket Tranquil was moved up in distance for two and quarter mile Jockey Club and won by a length and a half at odds of 1/5 from Abe Bailey's colt Apron. Tranquil won two other races in 1923, namely the Newmarket Oaks over 14 furlongs and the Liverpool St Leger on 7 November, beating the colt Twelve Pointer by a head in the latter event.
Tranquil ended the year with earnings of £20,707, making her the most financially successful horse of the season.
1924: four-year-old season.
Tranquil remained in training as a four-year-old and won one minor race, namely the Copeland Stakes. She was scheduled to run in the Coronation Cup at Epsom in une but was withdrawn owing to the exceptionally heavy ground. Tranquil was injured in late summer and did not race again.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Tranquil as a "superior" winner of the 1000 Guineas but an "inferior" winner of the St Leger.
Breeding record.
Tranquil was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Lord Derby's stud. She produced at least four foals between 1926 and 1935:
Tranquil was euthanised in October 1938.

Majurugenta

Marjurugenta is the debut album by Mozambican marrabenta band Ghorwane, recorded in August 1991 at Real World Studios but not released until September 1993 by Real World Records. The band had built up a reputation in their native country throughout the 1980s for their unique urban dance musical style and politically conscious lyrics, pulling from genres such as marrabenta and xigbu. After being denied visas to play at a European festival in 1987, it soon became possible for the band to play the world music-celebrating WOMAD festival in 1990. While on their trip to the festival, the band were approached by the WOMAD-affiliated Real World Records to record their debut album.
The album combines warm melodies, soulful horns, East African guitar work, dance rhythms (mostly in Mozambican styles), soft vocals, subdued percussion and elements of further afield genres such as soukous (especially prevalent in the rhythms and horns), reggae, jazz as well as Portuguese and Brazilian music. Jose "Zeca" Alage's breezy saxophone work is a defining feature of the music. Lyrically, the album addresses the poor state of Mozambican society and criticises how the country's citizens were dying due to lack of medicine and transport during the civil war. The album received critical acclaim, with praising aimed at the agit-prop lyrics, danceable rhythms and unique sound. Algae was murdered prior to the band's 1993 European tour in promotion of the album.
Background and recording.
Naming themselves after a lake which never runs dry, Ghorwane formed in Mozambique in 1983, eight years after the country was liberated from Portugal, by which point the nation had become embroiled in the Mozambican Civil War which lasted into the 1990s. The band developed their own style of dance music that, although urban, still tied the band members to their roots, drawing from the ethnic languages and rhythms of Mozambique and writing songs in their native languages. The band pulled from marrabenta, an urban genre which relies on percussion and guitar that developed in Maputo, as well as xigbu, a style of drum-based chant. Ghorwane became known throughout the country in the 1980s due to their sharp political commentary, to the point where state police would routinely attend their live concerts in order to monitor their lyrics. Nonetheless, they received the blessing of Samora Machel in 1985, one year before his death, who referred to the band as "good boys".
Vocalist and saxophonist Zeca Algae wrote "Massotcha" in 1986, which criticised the horrors of the civil war and attacked the danger posed by the military to the people they were supposed to protect. It was recorded among a selection of the band's material that same year, and reached number 1 on the country's singles chart. The group endured harder times after Machel's times in both political and personal senses. For instance, the government withheld their visas in 1987 to prevent them from performing at a European music festival. Later that year though, they played abroad for the first time at the Swaziland independence festival, and in 1990, Ghorwane were able to participate in the WOMAD festival, at the invitation of the festival's founder Peter Gabriel.
It was during their trip to play at the festival that the WOMAD-affiliated record label Real World Records offered Ghorwane the opportunity to record their debut album. "Majurugenta" was recorded and mixed at the label's Real World Studios, Box, Wiltshire, in August 1991. Chris Lawson recorded the album, though he is not credited as producer. Richard Evans mixed the album.
Composition.
"Majurugenta" displays the band's unique style of Mozambican pop which combines warm melodies, dance rhythms and soulful horns. The rhythms are in largely the local marrabenta style, though the album incorporates rhythms from throughout Mozambique as well as ones from other countries, like soukous and reggae, as is evident on the title track. Elements of soukous are also prominent in the album's horn section. "Rogue" magazine felt the album's "bewitching slow-lope rhythms" were a particularly Mozambican characteristic. "Majuruengta" also features an East African guitar sound and an undertow of Portuguese and Brazilian music. Jose "Seca" Alage's solo saxophone is breezy playing adds colour to the album's unique sound.
"Rhythms" magazine felt the album was a melancholy mix of jazz and local rhythms which exudes a warm, intimate feel, most prominently in the trumpet and saxophone horn section. Music critic Robert Christgau disagreed that the music was melancholy, instead writing that the album is "happy yet principled" Mozambican music that is "soukous-smooth even if the interlocking rhythms show off their seams and the horns are equal parts intricacy and palpable deliberation." "Folk Roots", meanwhile, made note of the subdued percussion, soft vocals, "mild-mannered" guitar and "delightfully floating saxophone." The title track features a guitar lilt which the "New Internationalist" compared to contemporary Western dance music.
Five of the songs on "Majurugenta" were written by Roberto Chitsonzo, with the remaining four songs written by Jose Algae. The lyrics on the album address the poor state of the band's Mozambican society, with an explicit message that the Frelimo government was becoming too preoccupied fighting Renamo rebels to the point where it would not provide for its citizens. With reoccurring themes of tragedy and "left puritanism," the songs on the album attacks how the country's citizens were dying in the horror of the civil war due to lack of medicine and transport. The album's title track refers to a fashion style. "Muthimba" incorporates a traditional lament that criticises the rigours of war. Buluku" ("Trousers") refers to how several women resorted to prostitution in order to afford closing, while "Mavabwyl" ("Illness") is a tribute to those dying in hospitals with only limited medicine.
Release and reception.
Although "Majurugenta" was recorded in August 1991, it was not released by Real World Records until 10 September 1993. Nonetheless, the two year delay was said by one critic to "[have] done nothing to reduce its vivacity." The band's first international release, it features portions of Malangatana Valente Nguenha's 1991 painting "Sim Tudo" photographed by Martinho Fernando on the front and back covers, as well as design and art direction by Sy-Jeng Cheng and photography in the liner notes by Pete Williams. Gerry Lyseight provides liner notes. Prior to the band's 1993 European tour in promotion of "Majurugenta", the band's vocalist and saxophonist Zeca Algae was murdered. While his assassination was not of a political nature, it nonetheless reflected Mozambique's social turmoil.
"Majurugenta" received positive reviews from critics. John Storm Roberts of AllMusic was very favourable, commenting that the "really extremely individual and attractive" album is enriched by Alagae's solo saxophone playing. "Rogue" called the album "bewildering," while "The Guardian" called it "[t]he best African release of the month. [...] It seems a minor miracle that music this good should be produced in a country battered by civil war." Robert Christgau was very positive, calling it "three-dimensional agitprop--tragedy and left puritanism in one resolutely hedonistic package," while "Esquire" wrote that the album "issues People's challenges to the genocidal Renamo handidos armados and still cooks mellow." Mark Sullivan of "Option" named it his 4th favourite album of 1993. "Global Rhythm" listed it as one of three "Recommended Recordings" by Ghorwane. In "The Rough Guide to World Music: Africa &amp; Middle East", Simon Broughton refers to Ghorwane as "the masters of Mozambican urban dance music rising from traditional roots to contemporary beats." They refer to "Majurugenta" as "[a] party album per excellence" boasting a big sound that requires "big speakers," and write that the album "always gets people moving." "New Internationalist" felt the title track was "equipped with the kind of captivating guitar lilt that would put much Western dance music to shame."

St Mary's Church, Wix

St Mary's Church is a Listed Anglican parish church in the village of Wix, Essex, England. Formerly associated with a priory from the Middle Ages, the present church dates largely from the 18th century.
Wix Priory.
The Benedictine Priory of St Mary was a religious house founded in by brothers Walter Mascherell, Alexander de Wix and their sister Edith, who were the children of Walter the Deacon, who owned much of area in the late 11th and early 12th centuries. The house incorporated a church which had existed at the location since . The priory was never large, containing only around ten nuns, but was still highly influential in the immediate vicinity. It owned large areas of land in Wix and much of the surrounding countryside. It held the status of a manor in its own right, and the tenants of its copyholds in Wix were obliged to perform manorial service.
By the time of the Peasants' Revolt (1381), this was generating friction, and during the revolt, the priory was attacked by its angry villagers, who destroyed its Manorial rolls which detailed their obligations to it. After the Revolt had ended, those responsible were evicted by the prioress, who then fined each one before allowing them to return. The priory remained in operation until the 16th Century, though became increasingly rundown. In 1525, it was shut down by Thomas Wolsey, being one of thirty small religious houses which were closed to provide funding for The King's School, Ipswich and the Oxford institution now known as Christ Church. After its closure, the priory was demolished, leaving only the church. The only remains of the priory which can still be seen are the now-blocked 13th Century arches which form the church's north wall.
Later history.
The church was later restored and mostly rebuilt in 1744, then again in 1888, with much of the original limestone and rubble composition being replaced in brick. Listed status was granted in 1966. The church has a free-standing bell frame, which once contained three bells, though now has only one, dating from the 15th Century. An attempt was made in 1975 to steal the bell, which resulted in the frame being replaced with a modern design.

Cvitan Spužević

Cvitan Spužević (c. 1885 – ?) was a Yugoslav lawyer, politician and humanitarian. As a Croat from Bosnia-Herzegovina, during World War II he was a member of the ZAVNOBiH and was later appointed as a minister in the first government of People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1945 to 1946.
Biography.
Spužević was born into a Bosnian Croat family which had been honored and celebrated with verses by the 19th century Croatian poet S.S. Kranjčević. Spužević graduated from Mostar "Realgymnasium" in 1901/2. After completing his law studies, he practiced law in Mostar. He was close to the Catholic Church and his practice was also employed as a legal representative for Herzegovina Franciscan friars’ in Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Spužević was active in politics and public life in general between the two world wars. Since 1910, he was a member of the Mostar branch of Croatian cultural society "Napredak", while in 1929 he was elected its vicepresident. In 1927 elections he opposed the policy of the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) and founded Croatian National Union (HNZ) in opposition to it. In 1928 Spužević was also a founding member of the Fishermen society of Bosnia-Herzegovina branch in Mostar. In 1935 he was a board member of the Land bank of Bosnia-Herzegovina ("Zemaljska banka za BiH").
Second World War.
During the German and Italian invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Spužević and his friend fra Leo Petrović organised negotiations between the surrendering Yugoslav army and invading Axis forces, still fighting in the Mostar area. After the breakup of Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Axis puppet state Independent State of Croatia under Ustaša regime was formed, encompassing Bosnia and Herzegovina. Soon, ustaša campaign of ethnic cleansing, directed against Serb, Jewish and Roma population (as well as all Croat opponents and dissidents) reached Mostar. In July 1942, according to his diary, Spužević tried to intervene with the ustaša minister of the interior Artuković to save some Mostar families, including Serbs, from the internment or execution. He also asked for an immediate release of the Serbs from ustaša prisons and for a stop and reversal of racist and discriminatory ustaša policies (lay-offs, expulsions etc.), as well as sanctions against those who committed crimes against the Serb population of eastern Herzegovina in the summer of 1941.
Between 1942 and mid-1943, Spužević, vicar fra Leo Petrović, fra Bonicije Rupčić and Mostar Serbs Milivoj Jelačić and Đorđe Obradović formed the Committee for the stricken persons, raising funds and food for the exiled, expelled, and vulnerable population in general. Most of the funds went to poverty-stricken Serbs of the area, which were discriminated and generally unwanted by the ustaša authorities.
In 1943 and 1944, ustaša authorities arrested, imprisoned and executed many of their opponents in Mostar area, especially the communists and anyone connected to Yugoslav partisans. Prominent pre-war members of the ustaša-banned Croatian Peasant Party were also targeted, for instance dr. Ivica Milaković and Blaž Slišković (killed in Jasenovac Concentration camp). Spužević was saved by an intervention of fra Leo Petrović, a prominent Franciscan friar well respected among the population and recognized as such by ustaša authorities. After this crackdown, in August 1944 guerilla Yugoslav partisans managed to evacuate Spužević from ustaša-held Mostar and bring him to the territory they controlled, after Herzegovina Communist Party chairman Vaso Miškin “Crni” organized an action together with fra Petrović, who chose to stay in Mostar and look after Spužević’s family. Usually ustaša would arrest and imprison or intern a family of someone who left to join the partisans, but Spužević’s family – thanks to fra Petrović - was an exception in Mostar. All three Spužević’s sons eventually left to join the partisans, too. Spužević's cousin, judge dr. Đuro Spužević, on the other hand, was a deputy county prefect of Vrhbosna county and later county prefect (Croatian: "veliki župan") of Mostar-based Hum county in ustaša regime (1942-5).
Dr. Spužević was elected as a member of State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1944.
Communist Yugoslavia.
After Mostar was liberated by the Partisans in February 1945, Spužević served as the vice-president of the county liberation committee, provisional authority for Mostar area. As a close friend of some prominent Mostar friars, he tried to intervene with other partisan authorities to enable the friars to exhume and rebury friars the partisans had shot in Široki Brijeg. Spužević also protested against the killings of the friars there, arguing that some of them were old and frail and most definitely did not carry arms or resist the partisans. His best friend, Franciscan provincial Leo Petrović was also shot in Mostar before Spužević entered the liberated town, while he was still in Čitluk. Spužević openly bemoaned this to the new authorities. Still, he expressed gratitude to the liberators of Mostar at a public rally. In front of Dalmatian and Herzegovinian partisan troops parading in Mostar, he decried those still not joining the National liberation army in their fight against the Axis, choosing instead to wait together with the fraction of pre-war Croatian Peasant Party and its chairman Vladko Maček.
After the partisans liberated Sarajevo and the war's end seemed imminent, ZAVNOBiH held its third session in Sarajevo at the end of April 1945, promulgating itself into the national assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina and appointing the first national government. On April 27, a cabinet under prime minister Rodoljub Čolaković was formed. Dr. Spužević was appointed the minister of construction. Other Bosnian Croats in the government included Jakov Grgurić (deputy prime minister), Ante Babić (education), and Ante Martinović (forestry). Spužević's ministry was responsible for the organisation of extensive reconstruction of the war-torn country. In October 1945, he was elected to the governing board of the newly re-established Croatian cultural society "Napredak" in Sarajevo.
1946 elections.
For the first post-war Bosnia-Herzegovina elections in October 1946, United People’s Liberation Front decided to put Spužević on their ticket for Posušje-Široki Brijeg constituency, running for the seat of a deputy in the Constituent Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the Communist Party in Posušje and Western Herzegovina wanted another lawyer, a long-time communist born in Posusje, dr. Ante (Tune) Ramljak to be on the ballot instead, a compromise solution was found and Ramljak and Spužević ran against each other in the constituency, both as People’s Front candidates. Spužević refused to have Marko Šoljić, a long-time communist and a Spanish civil war veteran as his running mate on his ticket, as the Communist Party suggested. Posušje communists described Spužević in their internal reports as connected to the friars and clerical elements, hostile to the communists and dr Ramljak. Spužević actively campaigned and canvassed his constituency, supported by the Catholic Church, but eventually lost to Ramljak by a landslide. After hearing the results, Spužević left Mostar.
Legacy.
Spužević has been largely forgotten in historiography and the public in general. On the other hand, after the breakup of Socialist Yugoslavia, a street in western part of Mostar was named after his cousin, Đuro (Đuka) Spužević, who was entrusted by ustaše regime with a position of a Hum county prefect during the war.
In the night of February 19, 2018, Bosnian Croat student activists, studying history at Mostar University, removed the street signs in a Mostar street named after Mile Budak, Ustaša ideologue, NDH government minister and the author of racial legislation in WWII (tried and executed in 1945 as a war criminal), replacing them with plaques “Cvitan Spužević Street.” The acting mayor of Mostar, Ljubo Bešlić, welcomed the action and commented that dr. Spužević deserves to have a street in Mostar. National and regional media welcomed the idea as well. Serb orthodox priest in Mostar, Radivoje Krulj, stated he was "thrilled" to have learned of the action and that Spužević's name reminds him of compassion and thankfulness.
Family.
Spužević's cousin Đuro (Đuka) Spužević (1900–81) emigrated to Italy and then to South Africa in 1945, becoming a cultural and political leader of the Croat community there.
Spužević is a maternal great-grandfather of Bosnian Serb academic and historian, Vuk Bačanović.

Cabang Atas

The Cabang Atas ("Van Ophuijsen Spelling System": Tjabang Atas) — literally 'highest branch' in Malay — was the traditional Chinese establishment or gentry of colonial Indonesia. They were the families and descendants of the Chinese officers, high-ranking colonial civil bureaucrats with the ranks of "Majoor", "Kapitein" and "Luitenant der Chinezen". They were referred to as the baba bangsawan [‘Chinese gentry’] in Malay, and the ba-poco in Java Hokkien.
As a privileged social class, they exerted a powerful influence on the political, economic and social life of pre-revolutionary Indonesia, in particular on its local Chinese community. Their institutional control of the Chinese officership declined with the colonial Ethical Policy of the early twentieth century, but their political, economic and social influence lasted until the Indonesian revolution (1945-1950).
Origin of term.
The phrase 'Cabang Atas' was first used by the colonial Indonesian historian Liem Thian Joe in his book "Riwajat Semarang" (published in 1933). The term refers to a small group of old gentry families that dominated the Dutch colonial institution of the Chinese officership (see 'Kapitan Cina'); this was colonial Indonesia's equivalent of the Chinese mandarinate. As a class, they intermarried to maintain their political and economic power, owned extensive agricultural landholdings and monopolised the colonial government's lucrative revenue farms.
In older literature, the Cabang Atas is referred to as the baba bangsawan (Malay for 'Chinese gentry').
History.
Origin and rise.
The oldest families of the Cabang Atas traced their roots in Indonesia back to early Chinese allies and compradores of the Dutch East India Company, in a period that lasted until the latter's bankruptcy in 1799. Many of these Chinese magnates — such as Souw Beng Kong, first "Kapitein der Chinezen" of Batavia (1580-1644); or the sons of Han Siong Kong (1673-1743), founder of the Han family of Lasem — played an instrumental role in establishing Dutch colonial rule in Indonesia in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Some families came of gentry stock in China, but many more started off as successful merchant families. They shared some common traits with the scholar-gentry of Imperial China, but accumulated much greater dynastic wealth thanks partly to the protection of Dutch colonial law.
The foundation of their political power was their near-hereditary control of the bureaucratic posts of "Majoor", "Kapitein" and "Luitenant der Chinezen". This gave them a high degree of political and legal jurisdiction over the local Chinese community. By colonial Indonesian tradition, descendants of Chinese officers bore the hereditary title "Sia".
In addition, most families of the Cabang Atas owned particuliere landerijen or private domains in the "Ommelanden" (rural hinterland) of Batavia (now Jakarta); or appanage leaseholds in the Javanese princely states. This gave them significant seigniorial powers over the indigenous peasants living on their landholdings, but also earned them much enmity and resentment.
The economic foundation of the Cabang Atas, as pointed out by the American historian James R. Rush, was their monopolistic control of the colonial government's "pachten" (revenue or tax farms), in particular the highly lucrative opium pacht. These farms were auctioned off with much fanfare and ceremony at the local colonial administrator's residence to the highest bidders, and were most frequently won by members of the Cabang Atas or others allied to, or backed, by them. Menghong Chen highlights, however, that among some more established Cabang Atas families, commercial activities as represented by the revenue farms were looked down upon, hence a gradual shift towards landownership and agriculture. In any case, the accumulation of great fortunes among Cabang Atas families received the protection of Dutch colonial law. This legal certainty gave a firm basis to the creation of long-lasting bureaucratic and landowning dynasties of great wealth in colonial Indonesia that were not as common in pre-revolutionary China.
Ethnically and culturally, families of the Cabang Atas were overwhelmingly creolised 'Peranakan Chinese'. There was extensive intermarriage between Cabang Atas families in order to consolidate their political power and influence, as well as estates and fortunes. Social mobility, however, was possible; Cabang Atas families sometimes took in successful "totok", or newly arrived, settlers as sons-in-law. As cited by the historian Ong Hok Ham, notable examples included the late nineteenth-century, "totok" businessman Oei Tjie Sien (1835–1900), who married a middle-class Peranakan woman; and the latter's Peranakan son Oei Tiong Ham, Majoor der Chinezen (1866–1924), who firmly sealed the family's social ascent by marrying into the Cabang Atas and by his eventual elevation to the Chinese officership.
Modern history.
In the early twentieth century, in keeping with their so-called 'Ethical Policy', the Dutch colonial authorities made a concerted effort to appoint government officials, including Chinese officers, based on merit rather than family background. Some of these candidates came from Peranakan families outside the Cabang Atas, such as the Semarang-based, left-wing newspaper owner editor and journalist, Sie Hian Liang, Luitenant der Chinezen. Also not born into the Cabang Atas were a number of significant totok appointees, such as Tjong A Fie, "Majoor der Chinezen" (1860–1921) in Medan, Lie Hin Liam, "Luitenant der Chinezen" in Tangerang and Khoe A Fan, "Luitenant der Chinezen" in Batavia.
Nonetheless, descendants of the Cabang Atas continued to feature prominently in the officership until the end of colonial rule: for example, Han Tjiong Khing, the last Majoor der Chinezen of Surabaya, was a direct descendant of Han Bwee Kong, the city's first Dutch-appointed Kapitein der Chinezen.
Beyond the Chinese officership, members of the Cabang Atas took a leading role in the emerging modernization social and cultural movement of the late colonial period. The influential Confucian and educational organization Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan, founded in 1900, was headed for many decades by its founding President, Phoa Keng Hek Sia, scion of a Cabang Atas family, and dominated by others of Phoa's class and background. The aim of the organization was to renew and purify the practice of Confucianism in the Dutch East Indies, and to introduce modern educational opportunities to the colony's Chinese subjects. Another important organization was the charity foundation "Ati Soetji", headed for many decades by the women's rights activist Aw Tjoei Lan, better known as Njonja Kapitein Lie Tjian Tjoen, who as the wife, daughter and daughter-in-law of Chinese officers came from the ranks of the Cabang Atas.
Politically, the Cabang Atas also pioneered Chinese-Indonesian involvement in modern politics. They were mainly associated with Chung Hwa Hui or CHH, a modern political party that was seen as the mouthpiece of the colonial Chinese establishment. CHH's chairman was none other than Majoor Han Tjiong Khing's distant cousin, the Dutch-educated landlord H. H. Kan, a doyen of the Cabang Atas and landowning gentry of Batavia. CHH representatives in Indonesia's first legislature, the Volksraad, were largely scions of the Cabang Atas: presided by Kan, they included Jo Heng Kam, Luitenant der Chinezen, Loa Sek Hie and Han Tiauw Tjong. Due to their largely establishment background, progressive elements dubbed CHH's parliamentary arm as the 'Packard group' after the expensive cars many of them used.
Their close proximity to Dutch colonial authorities meant that many families of the Cabang Atas were early adopters of the Dutch language and many European cultural and social mores. European education and westernisation among the Cabang Atas began in the second half of the nineteenth century, and became the norm by the beginning of the twentieth century. By the start of the twentieth century, Dutch had become the most commonly spoken language at the homes of most families of the Cabang Atas. While tying them ever closer to the colonial authorities, the European outlook of the class put them at odds with the overwhelming majority of the Chinese-Indonesian population they had traditionally led.
Already attacked for their perceived Dutch sympathies in the late colonial period, the Cabang Atas bore the brunt of the Indonesian Revolution from 1945 until 1949. The end of Dutch colonial rule in 1950 saw the exile and emigration of many families of the Cabang Atas. The turbulent early decades of Indonesian independence also ensured an end to their centuries-long dominating and privileged position in Indonesian political, economic and social life.
Titles.
The ba-poco or Cabang Atas used an elaborate system of titles in the Dutch East Indies:

Langenhagen Pferdemarkt station

Langenhagen Pferdemarkt station (Langenhagen (Han) until 27 May 2000) is a station in the town of Langenhagen, which lies north of Hanover, the capital of the German state of Lower Saxony. At present it is served by lines S4 and S5 of the Hanover S-Bahn. It was opened as Langenhagen station in 1890 and was the only station in Langenhagen in the first half of the 20th century. Three extra stations have been built since because of the growth of Langenhagen and the development of Hannover Airport. Since regional and long-distance services now only stop in the neighbouring Langenhagen Mitte station, Pferdemarkt station is now only served by S-Bahn services.
Location.
The station is located in the northern part of the centre of Langenhagen. It is located on a side street about 400 metres from "Walsroder Straße", which forms the north-south axis for Langenhagen’s road traffic. While a large industrial estate is located on the western side, there is a larger residential area on the eastern side, where the entrance building is also located. As the centre of Langenhagen has shifted significantly southwards in the course of the last century, the station is away from the centre and only serves the northern residential areas.
History.
The first station building, which was south of the current location, was built before the opening of the railway in 1890. The construction of the railway to Celle brought changes. Already in 1914, planning had started on a new entrance building further north, as the railway line was to be raised by a few metres above ground level. The construction did not begin until 1920 and it was completed in 1921.The entrance building was built in the North German clinker style ("Norddeutschen Klinkerarchitektur") with influences of German reform style ("Reformstil"). The architecture is based on the original drawings of Ernst Moeller and Alexander Behnes. The building originally contained the station services, Langenhagen’s "Bahnmeisterei" (the office of the head of track maintenance) as well as some waiting rooms. However, since the line to Celle was not yet in operation, it was designed to be used differently. The waiting room for the third and fourth class and later the entrance hall were temporarily used by Langenhagen's Roman Catholic parish for worship. It became a junction station on 15 May 1938 with the start of operations on the Langenhagen–Celle railway. A siding was built to Hannover Airport for freight traffic. As part of the S-Bahn construction, the track was upgraded and the platform for trains towards Celle were closed and the entrances were walled off. With the commissioning of the S-Bahn network on 28 May 2000, all stops for trains to Celle and for all other regional trains were transferred to Langenhagen Mitte station. At the same time, the station, previously simply referred to as "Langenhagen" was renamed "Langenhagen Pferdemarkt" (horse market). Both the entrance building and the access to the platforms were redeveloped using funds for the upgrade of the S-Bahn. In the new millennium, the now listed station building was embossed on a commemorative coin entitled "700 Jahre Langenhagen" (700 years of Langenhagen). In September 2013, it was sold by Deutsche Bahn’s subsidiary, Main Asset Management GmbH, to a private investor under an agreement preserving access to the platforms. Since 2014, comprehensive preservation work has been carried out and access to the station building's wings has been restored. Since the opening of the line, the station has provided a significant economic boost for the town.
Rail services.
Prior to the electrification of the railways, trains were steam-hauled. These disappeared in the 1960s because of the electrification of the Hanover–Hamburg railway. The Heath Railway to Buchholz was not electrified, however, so diesel locomotives ran through the station. This traffic ended only with the electrification of the Heath Railway to Bennemühlen for the Hanover S-Bahn, because regional trains now no longer stop in the station. Since then it has only been served by electric S-Bahn trains.
The station has no connections to the bus and Stadtbahn services of the Hanover Region.

Roebuck Plains Station

Roebuck Plains Station is a pastoral lease that is located close to the township of Broome in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. It is one of the closest pastoral leases to Broome.
Roebuck Plains is also the name of a roadhouse on the Great Northern Highway, just east of Broome.
The "Plains" in the name is associated with wetlands situated adjacent to Roebuck Bay.
Description.
The station is located approximately east of Broome on a rich marine floodplain. It occupies an area of and is able to support around 20,000 head of cattle. The property is a mixture of floodplains and sandy pindan country.
History.
The traditional owners of the area are the Yawuru peoples.
The property was acquired and developed by the pearlers, Streeter and Company, to supply meat to Broome. A slaughterhouse was also established on the outskirts of town to process the cattle and sheep that were being raised on the property.
The homestead burnt down in 1949; the fire started from a defective kerosene refrigerator.
In 1953 the station was acquired by the Harris family. It was stocked with 10,000 head of cattle at the time.
The Indigenous Land Corporation acquired Roebuck Plains Station in 1999, and in 2006 the Federal Court determined the station was the exclusive possession of the Yawuru under native title. In 2014 the ILC handed the lease over to the Nyamba Buru Yawuru Corporation. Pat Dodson, the chairman of the company, accepted the lease but handed management of the station back to the ILC. The property and the adjacent commercial cattle yards are worth around 15 million. 
The plains are also subject to analysis of indigenous perceptions of the landscape.
In 2018, the property was flooded when it received of rain through the wet season, with half of it falling in one week in January. The 6,000 head of cattle had to be moved off the floodplains to higher ground. The cyclone that brought the rain also caused extensive damage to the property, with trees blown over, buildings damaged and fences washed away.

Global T20 Canada

The Global T20 Canada is a 20-over cricket tournament played in Canada. The first edition of the tournament took place during June and July 2018 with six teams competing. Each team featured four local Canadian cricketers in each squad, along with international players. The inaugural tournament in 2018 took place at the Maple Leaf Cricket Club in King City, Ontario, while the 2019 tournament took place at the CAA Centre in Brampton, Ontario. Bombay Sports Limited are the owners of the league, and also the organizers of the Euro T20 Slam that was set to begin on August 30, 2019.
History.
The International Cricket Council (ICC) sanctioned the tournament in February 2018, and it is the first fully sanctioned T20 league in North America outside of the Caribbean. Canada's Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, was pleased with the ICC's decision to approve the league.
In May 2018, Cricket Canada announced that the inaugural edition of the tournament would start on 28 June, with the final being held on 15 July 2018. Vancouver Knights won the tournament, beating Cricket West Indies B Team by seven wickets in the final.
The 2019 league began on 25 July, with the final match taking place on 11 August. The second-round game between Montreal Tigers and Toronto Nationals on August 7, 2019, was delayed for two hours in a protest over unpaid wages; some pay issues date back to the 2018 tournament. The protest occurred even though Toronto Nationals captain Yuvraj Singh's fundraiser for his YouWeCan Foundation, had been hosted two days earlier by League organizers. 
The third season of the tournament, scheduled to be held in 2020, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was later rescheduled to held from 24 June to 11 July 2021 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The 2021 tournament was ultimately cancelled "due to evolving concerns regarding COVID-19 and strict preventive measures taken by the Government of Malaysia to contain the spread of the pandemic."
Media.
Mediapro was appointed as "global consultant" for Global T20 Canada's media rights in 2019, handling aspects of world feed production and international distribution via its various regional subsidiaries. Locally, the tournament's broadcast rights are split between Asian Television Network and TSN.

Lajka

Lajka (in English: "Laika") is a 2017 Czech science fiction comedy animated film. It is inspired by Soviet space dog Laika.
Plot.
The film starts in Baikonur. A female dog is captured while trying to find something to feed her puppies. She is named Laika and brought to a local spaceport. Professor Voroljov and his assistant Kokotov begin preparing Laika for space travel. On the day before the launch, Laika manages to get out of her cage and visits the space rocket. Then she returns for her puppies and smuggles them into the rocket. 
The following day she is launched into space along with her pups hidden in the rocket. The news of Laika's travel to space arrive to the United States. The Americans, in response, send a chimpanzee named Ham to space. Ham is soon followed by other rockets with various animals. 
All rockets arrive at a planet named Qem. They meet the natives of the planet and are accompanied by a native named Quirkrk. The animals are happy in the new environment as there are no humans. The Soviets however soon send cosmonaut Jurij Levobočkin to space. He is initially sent to the Moon, but arrives at Qem instead. He then meets Lajka, and settles down, but soon begins craving meat. Qem's natives soon go missing; it is revealed that Levobočkin invented a "freezer gun" and is hunting and eating them. Laika and Ham are fighting him just as he is about to bake Quirkrk. The clash ends when Levobočkin falls into the furnace, and the animals leave. Levobočkin, however, survives, now wanting revenge, and the animals prepare for battle against him. The American astronaut Neil Knokaut arrives and eventually joins Levobočkin in hunting. Laika outsmarts them and Levobočkin and Knokaut freeze each other.

Mosque Me Too

The Mosque Me Too movement (#MosqueMeToo) is predominantly a Muslim women's movement where female pilgrims speak up about sexual abuse experienced on the Hajj, the Islamic pilgrimage to one of Islam's holiest places, Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The movement spread to Muslim women sharing sexual abuse experiences at other Muslim religious centers and holy places across the world such as at Jama Masjid, New Delhi, India. The usage of the 'Me Too' in the movement stems from the Me Too movement which gained worldwide prominence in October 2017.
Background.
In February 2018, a Pakistani Muslim woman shared her experiences on Facebook of sexual abuse at the Hajj. The post was subsequently deleted, but not before it had been seen by enough people to trigger more experiences being shared.
Mona Eltahawy, an Egyptian American journalist, shared her experiences of sexual abuse on Hajj in a book in 1982, which were retweeted in February using the hashtag #MosqueMeToo. At the time of the event she remembered thinking, "Who wants to talk about sexual assault at a holy place? No one would believe it." Many other women came to the social media using the hashtag #MosqueMeToo to also share their experiences of sexual abuse on this religious pilgrimage.
Critiques.
On social media some people reacted to this movement critically, by saying that it is a tool of Islamophobia or Western propaganda.

Yura Corporation d.o.o.

Yura Corporation () is a Serbian cable and harnessing manufacturing company headquartered in Rača, Serbia. It is owned by the South Korean manufacturing company Yura Corporation.
History.
Yura Corporation d.o.o. was established on 18 March 2010, with the headquarters in Rača, Serbia. The company was established through Government of Serbia subsidies to the South Korean cable manufacturing company Yura Corporation, which is the cooperator of the largest South Korean automobile manufacturers Kia Motors and Hyundai Motors.
In April 2010, Yura Corporation bought the insolvent Serbian manufacturing company "Zastava Elektro" based in Rača, for a sum of 3 million euros. Later, it renovated its facilities and renewed production.
In June 2011, Yura Corporation opened in the city of Niš its second facility in Serbia, employing additional 1,500 people. In November 2011, Yura Corporation subsidiary company "Yura Shinwon" opened its facility in Niš, employing 500 people.
In 2012, Yura Corporation opened its fourth facility in Leskovac. As of November 2012, Yura Corporation employed around 5,500 employees in Serbia.
In September 2015, the mayor of Leskovac confirmed that Yura Corporation is building yet another facility in Leskovac, its fifth facility in Serbia. When finished by the end of 2018, it would employ additional 3,000 people.
In February 2018, Yura Corporation announced that it is building another facility in Leskovac, worth 40 million euros.
Market and financial data.
Over the years, Yura Corporation emerged as one of the top Serbian net exporters. For 2014, it was third largest net exporter of Serbia with 119 million euros worth of exports.
Labor controversies.
Since Yura Corporation was established in Serbia in 2010 through Government's subsidies, there were constant media reports about the inhumane working conditions for its employees. According to these reports, employees are forced to work in harsh conditions and to be silent about the violations of labor laws, due to high unemployment rates in the country and threats by the investors to leave the country if complaints and eventual syndicate strikes continue to disrupt company's reputation. Among the violations are: mobbing, insulting, cursing and even physical attacks such as slapping and other forms of harassment.
In 2015, there were even reports that the workers are not allowed to use the toilets due to decreased production productivity, and that instead they are using diapers.

Mindia

Mindia is an opera in three acts composed by Otar Taktakishvili to a libretto in Georgian by Revas Tabukashvili. Based on the poem "The Snake-eater" by Vazha-Pshavela, it premiered on 23 July 1961 at the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre. The libretto also has versions in Russian and German.
Background and performance history.
"Mindia" was the first of Taktakishvili's six operas and remains the most frequently performed. He chose as his subject Mindia, a hero of Georgian folk myth and the protagonist of "The Snake-eater", an epic poem by Vazha-Pshavela written in 1901. Considered Vazha's greatest work, "The Snake-eater" tells the story of Mindia who consumes a snake and is suddenly conferred with the power to understand the voices of nature. Unable to reconcile his new power with his people's way of life, he ultimately commits suicide. For Vazha he was "an archetype of the poet-shaman unable to coexist with family or community." 
The opera premiered at the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre conducted by Odysseas Dimitriadis on 23 July 1961 coinciding with the centenary of Vazha's birth. As musicologist Maia Sigua points out, the personal "differentness" and pantheism inherent in both the poem and the opera were potentially dangerous themes during the Soviet era. Nevertheless, "Mindia" went on be performed throughout the Soviet Union. It had its West German premiere at the Saarland State Theatre in Saarbrücken during its 1973–1974 season. The East German premiere followed in 1982 at the Meiningen State Theatre. "Mindia" continues to be regularly revived at Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre.
Synopsis.
The setting for the opera is the mountains of Khevsureti in the time of Queen Tamar.
In Vazha's poem, Mindia is captured by wizards and held in their lair for several years. Desperate to escape, he tries to commit suicide by eating a snake. Instead of dying, he finds that he has now been conferred with magic powers which allow him to understand the voices of nature–plants, animals, and even waterfalls and mountains. He manages to escape and returns to his native village. It is at this point that the opera begins.
Girls from Mindia's village, including his sweetheart Msia, find him sleeping in a field. Rejoicing at his return, they run off to the village to announce that their hero has returned. Mindia's father, Khevisberi, tells him that in his absence Tshalkhia has killed his brother. According to their tradition, Khevisberi demands that Mindia take "blood revenge" by killing Tshalkhia. However, Mindia's affinity with nature and all life forbids this and he refuses his father's command. The village mocks him as a coward.
Suddenly, the villagers learn that they have been surrounded by invaders. Led by Mindia, they go out to meet the enemy. They return victorious but Khevisberi has been mortally wounded. He expresses as his dying wish that Mindia kill Tshalkhia, as does Msia. Yet again, Mindia refuses. However, when Tshalkhia attacks him, Mindia kills him in self defense. Overcome by remorse, and having lost his magic powers, Mindia leaves the village. Alone in the mountains, he commits suicide with a dagger. The voices of nature return to him as he lies dying.
Recordings.
There are two recordings of "Mindia", both released on the Melodiya label, a 1963 version in Russian and a 1964 version in Georgian.

Slavic Native Faith in Poland

Slavic Native Faith in Poland (Rodnovery; Polish: "Rodzimowierstwo") has in 2007, according to Scott Simpson, between 2000 and 2500 "actively engaged and regular participants". In 2020, Konrad Kośnik and Elżbieta Hornowska estimated that Rodnovers in Poland were between 7000 and 10,000.
History.
In 1818, the Polish folklorist and Slavophile Zorian Dołęga-Chodakowski (pseudonym of Adam Czarnocki; 1784–1825) stated that Poland "must return to [the] native faith". According to that, he's recognised as precursor of the Slavic Native Faith in Poland. Another precursor in Poland was Jan Sas Zubrzycki (1860–1935), who elaborated the doctrine of "God-Knowing" ("Bogoznawstwo").
In the interwar period, a few movements emerged in Poland, recognized as early Polish Slavic Native Faith followers: the "Święte Koło Czcicieli Światowida" ("Holy Circle of Worshippers of Svetovid"; 1921) of Władysław Kołodziej (1897–1978), "Demiurg" (1934), and Zadrugism (1937) of Jan Stachniuk (1905–1963). Another example is the pilot and army officer Zdzisław Harlender (1898–1939), who advocated Polish Native Faith in his book "Czciciele Dadźbóg Swarożyca" ("Worshipers of Dadźbóg Swarożyc", 1937).
The rapper and music producer Donatan is a self-declared adherent of Slavic Native Faith. He released his debut album "Równonoc" (English: "Equinox") in 2012 and is a prolific music producer in Poland; he produced the song "My Słowianie (We Are Slavic)" which represented Poland at the Eurovision Song Contest 2014.
Demographics.
In 2013, Simpson noted that Slavic Native Faith remains a "very small religion" in Poland, which is otherwise dominated by Roman Catholicism. He suggested that there were under 900 regularly active members of the main four registered Polish Native Faith organisations, and around as many adherents belonging to smaller, unregistered groups.
In 2017, he stated that between 2000 and 2500 "actively engaged and regular participants" were likely active in the country. In 2020, Konrad Kośnik and Elżbieta Hornowska estimated between 7000 and 10,000 Rodnovers in Poland.
Simpson observed that in the country, Slavic Native Faith's adherents were "still relatively young", and saw an overlap with the community of historical re-enactors. Kosnik and Hornowska observed that despite being young, Polish Rodnovers were spiritually mature and had joined the religion as it satisfied deep personal needs. They also observed that males constituted the majority of the community.
Rodnover organisations in Poland.
The major organisation of Rodnovery in Poland is the Rodnover Confederation.
There are five formally registered religious organisations:

Who? (film)

Who? is a 1974 British science fiction film based on the 1958 novel of the same name by Algis Budrys. It was directed by Jack Gold and stars Elliott Gould, Trevor Howard and Joseph Bova. Some video releases were retitled "The Man in the Steel Mask" or "Roboman".
Synopsis.
An enigmatic individual with a metal face is returned from East Germany and claims to be Lucas Martino, an American scientist who was working on a top-secret project but was severely injured and scarred in a car crash. American authorities hold him in custody while they try to establish whether the man is the real Martino or an impostor looking for secret information about the ultimate rocket project developed in the West.
Release.
Although one 1983 British source stated that the film was shelved for five years after its completion in 1974, contemporary sources indicate the film was screened theatrically in the U.S. in 1975, and broadcast on British television in 1976.
Reception.
Contemporary U.S. reviews were mixed to negative. The Iowa "Gazette" described it as "distinctly average but better than mediocre". The Kentucky "Courier-Journal" dismissed it as a "clinker", calling it an "inane... funereal mess".

Prem Sikka, Baron Sikka

Prem Nath Sikka, Baron Sikka is a British accountant and academic. He holds the position of Professor of Accounting at the University of Sheffield, and is Emeritus Professor of Accounting at the University of Essex.
Life and career.
Sikka migrated to the UK from India with his family in 1966, and left school two years later with five passes at CSE. He has said of his parents that they "were working-class people – and work killed them in the end": his mother died at the age of 53 and his father, a Labour Party activist, passed away at 59. He then became an accounts clerk with an insurance broker in London. He pursued his education via part-time study, gaining O-levels and A-levels before qualifying as a Chartered Certified Accountant from the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants in 1977.
Sikka worked in corporate accountancy during the 1970s, before joining North East London Polytechnic as a Lecturer in 1979, where he progressed to become a Senior Lecturer the following year, a Principal Lecturer in 1986, a Reader in 1993, and a Professor in 1995, before leaving the institution (now the University of East London) in 1996. In 1982, he earned a master's degree in Accounting and Finance from the London School of Economics. In 1991, he earned a PhD in Accounting from the University of Sheffield. In 1995 he earned a bachelor's degree in Social Sciences from the Open University. In 1996, Sikka joined the faculty of the University of Essex, where he now holds the position of Emeritus Professor. In 2017, he joined the University of Sheffield as Professor of Accounting.
Sikka is a co-founder of the Tax Justice Network, and has served as a Senior Adviser to it since its establishment in 2002. Through this he became involved in politics, briefing the Socialist Campaign Group before becoming involved in policy development for Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell during their time as Labour Party leader and Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer respectively, working on issues related to tax, corporate governance and executive pay.
He describes his hobbies as "travel, movies, table-tennis, badminton, music, Bollywood (1960s and 1970s), supporting West Ham, afflicting the comfortable and tormenting dinosaurs".
Criticism of the accounting profession.
Sikka is an outspoken critic of the accounting profession, particularly with regard to its roles in auditing public corporations and helping transnational corporations avoid taxes. He has written about auditing failures, corporate governance issues, money laundering, insolvency and tax avoidance for "The Guardian" since 1990. He has also written for "The Independent" and "HuffPost".
Sikka's research has been described as being about the "dark side of capitalism". In May 2017 Sikka featured in the documentary "The Spider's Web: Britain's Second Empire" on the UK's relationships with tax havens.
Sikka's active use of the media as an academic to criticise the accounting profession has itself been the subject of academic research.
House of Lords.
He was nominated for a life peerage in the 2020 Political Honours and created "Baron Sikka, of Kingswood in Basildon in the County of Essex" on 10 September.
Selected publications.
Sikka's academic research has examined problems in auditing, tax avoidance, corporate social responsibility, and corporate governance. 
According to Google Scholar, the following academic publications by Sikka have been cited over 100 times as of January 2019:

Niederburg, Kobern

The Niederburg ("Lower Castle") at Kobern, also called the "Niedernburg", "Unterburg" or "Neue Burg", is a hill castle above the municipality of Kobern-Gondorf in the county of Mayen-Koblenz in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate.
Location.
The ruins of the Niederburg stand at a height of about 150 metres above the village of Kobern on a hill ridge that points towards the Moselle. On the same ridge and about 50 metres higher, is the Oberburg ("Upper Castle") and St. Matthias' Chapel.
Description.
The castle has an amygdaloidal ground plan. It has a three-storey, 20-metre-high "bergfried", measuring 7.5 x 8 metres, with an elevated entrance at a height of 10 metres. There are also the remains of a two-storey, Late Gothic "palas". A wall tower and a cistern are also well preserved and there are significant portions of the outer walls. The castle was guarded to the west by a curtain wall with a "zwinger" and to the north by a throat ditch. The upper third of the "bergfried" and the battlements were rebuilt in the 19th century. Between 1976 and 1978, the state castle administration reconstructed and enhanced the "palas" and the cistern between the two towers.
History.
The castle was built in the mid-12th century. It is first recorded in 1195, when the then "Burgherr" made it a fiefdom of the Electorate of Trier. The female line of the lords of Isenburg-Kobern died out in the 13th century. The Kobern Castles and associated lordship passed via the heiress, Cecilia, to Frederick II of Neuerburg (a side line of the counts of Vianden). In 1309 the male line of this family also died out. Thereafter the castle and lordship was sold to the Archbishop of Trier. In 1688 the castle was destroyed.
Visiting.
The castle is open to the public all year round and may be visited free of charge.
Visitors may climb up to the castle on a footpath from the Mühlbach valley.
Monument protection.
The Niederburg is a protected cultural monument.

Anne Churchland

Anne K. Churchland is a neuroscientist at University of California, Los Angeles. Her laboratory studies the function of the posterior parietal cortex in cognitive processes such as decision-making and multisensory integration. One of her discoveries is that individual neurons in rodent posterior parietal cortex can multitask i.e. play a role in multiple behaviors. Another discovery is that rodents are similar to humans in their ability to perform multisensory integration, i.e. to integrate stimuli from two different modalities such as vision and hearing.
Churchland is an advocate of using rodents to study these cognitive processes, and together with scientists Zachary Mainen and Anthony Zador at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory she has made substantial advances in bringing to these species the advanced behavioral techniques previously available only in primates.
Churchland is a founding member of the International Brain Laboratory and an advisor to the Allen Institute for Brain Science.
She is the founder of "Anneslist", a website which promotes equality in representation across genders in scientific meetings. Her parents are the philosophers Patricia Churchland and Paul Churchland and her brother is neuroscientist Mark Churchland.

William Taylor (judge)

William Taylor (born 27 July 1944), is an English retired senior Circuit Judge for the City of Plymouth.
Career.
Taylor was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1968. He became a Circuit Judge in 1989 at the age of 44, the second youngest of his generation.
In June 1979, Taylor defended Maria Kristina Coppel, a 23 year old Swedish medical student, who had been arrested for attempting to smuggle drugs into the UK on behalf of Guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. The technique of brainwashing her and other female followers of the sect, which emerged during the court proceedings, ultimately led to the Guru's expulsion from India. Coppel received a suspended sentence.
Taylor was counsel for Nicholas Price, who was jailed for life for the murder of his three-year-old stepdaughter, Heidi Koseda, who starved to death in a locked room in Hillingdon, West London in 1984. The case prompted an overhaul of child care services after an independent inquiry criticized the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children for failing to act.
In 1986, Taylor was counsel for the defence during the trial of gangster-turned-state witness Francesco Di Carlo, the former head of the Mafia's British operations.
Another defendant he represented, Anton Johnson, was charged with stealing money from Southend United F.C., of which he was Chairman. Johnson was acquitted despite the prosecution calling Bobby Moore, former captain of England's World Cup side of 1966.
Taylor also defended Barry Terry, a senior Customs Officer charged with corruption and the smuggling of gold coins into the UK.
Taylor presided over the trial of Britain's most prolific paedophile, William Goad, at Plymouth Crown Court. Taylor sentenced Goad to life imprisonment for two charges of indecent assault and 14 counts of rape. From 2004-2015, Taylor was patron of "12s Company", a charity specialising in the counselling of victims of sexual abuse, particularly those of William Goad.
On 31 July 1998, Taylor sentenced a number of unnamed defendants to a total of 100 years imprisonment for the serial sexual abuse of their children and grandchildren over a 35-year period. The case was described as being akin to the high profile case of Fred West and Rosemary West.
Taylor is currently Chairman of the Board of Trustees at Hamoaze House in Plymouth, a day treatment centre for those addicted to drugs and/or alcohol.
Taylor is also President of the Devon Safer Communities Trust (DSCT), a charity which raises funds to provide activity programmes designed to keep vulnerable children off the streets.
In 2004, Taylor was appointed the Honorary Recorder of Plymouth by the City Council for life, in recognition of his long-standing fight against drugs and his campaign for a safer city, and he continues to play a significant role in the City's activities as its second citizen.
In 2005, Taylor was awarded an Honorary Doctorate, Doctor of Laws, by the University of Plymouth.
Taylor retired from the Bench in 2006 on health grounds.
In July 2014, in his role as Chairman of Plymouth University, Taylor suspended Wendy Purcell, the University's vice-chancellor, following complaints about her conduct. Wendy Purcell ceased employment at Plymouth University from December 31, 2015.
He stepped down from the University Board in September 2014.

Curve448

In cryptography, Curve448 or Curve448-Goldilocks is an elliptic curve potentially offering 224 bits of security and designed for use with the elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) key agreement scheme. Developed by Mike Hamburg of Rambus Cryptography Research, Curve448 allows fast performance compared with other proposed curves with comparable security. The reference implementation is available under an MIT license. The curve was favored by the Internet Research Task Force Crypto Forum Research Group (IRTF CFRG) for inclusion in Transport Layer Security (TLS) standards along with Curve25519. In 2017, NIST announced that Curve25519 and Curve448 would be added to "Special Publication 800-186", which specifies approved elliptic curves for use by the US Federal Government. A 2019 draft of FIPS 186-5 confirms this claim. Both are described in .
Mathematical properties.
Hamburg chose the Solinas trinomial prime base "p" = 2448 − 2224 − 1, calling it a "Goldilocks" prime "because its form defines the golden ratio "φ" ≡ 2224". The main advantage of a golden-ratio prime is fast Karatsuba multiplication.
The curve Hamburg used is an untwisted Edwards curve
E"d": . The constant "d" = −39081 was chosen as the smallest absolute value that had the required mathematical properties, thus a nothing-up-my-sleeve number.
Curve448 is constructed such that it avoids many potential implementation pitfalls.

3rd North Carolina Infantry Regiment

The 3rd North Carolina Infantry Regiment was a regiment of the Confederate States Army, formed shortly after the commencement of the American Civil War in May 1861.
Formation.
The unit completed its organization at Garysburg, North Carolina, in May, 1861. The men were volunteers from Wilmington and the counties of Green, Duplin, Cumberland, Onslow, Bladen, New Hanover, and Beaufort. In July part of the regiment moved to Richmond, Virginia, where some weeks later it was joined by the remaining companies.
Combat experience.
The regiment fought in many battles during the Civil War. At the Battle of Gettysburg the unit suffered terrible casualties, losing forty percent of the 548 men engaged. In April 1865 it surrendered, with just 4 officers and 53 men remaining.

<doc id="56665665" url="?curid=56665665" title="Misrepresentation in Indian Law">
Misrepresentation in Indian Law

A concept of English law that has been adopted in India, a misrepresentation is an untrue or misleading statement of fact made during negotiations by one party to another, which then induces that other party into the contract. The misled party may normally rescind the contract, and sometimes may be awarded damages as well (or instead of rescission).
In India (under IPC section-90).
In India, the federal laws defines misrepresentation under "Misconception Of Fact". This is dealt with under the Indian Penal Code in Section 90, which states:
Consent given firstly under fear of injury, and secondly under a misconception of fact, is not consent at all.
That is what is explained in the first part of Section 90. There are two grounds specified in Section 90 which are analogous to coercion and mistake of fact which are the familiar grounds that can vitiate a transaction under the jurisprudence of India and other countries. The factors set out in first part of Section 90 are from the point of view of the victim; the second part of Section 90 enacts the corresponding provision from the point of view of the accused. It envisages that the accused has knowledge of - or reason to believe that - the consent was given by the victim in consequence of fear of injury or misconception of fact. Thus the second part lays emphasis on the knowledge or reasonable belief of the person who obtains the tainted consent. The requirements of both parts should be cumulatively satisfied. In other words, the Court has to determine whether the person giving the consent has done so under fear or misconception of fact; the court should also be satisfied that the person doing the act (i.e. the alleged offender) is conscious of the fact or should have reason to think that but for the fear or misconception, the consent would not have been given. This is the scheme of Section 90 which is couched in negative terminology.
Vitiating factors.
Misrepresentation is one of several vitiating factors that can affect the validity of a contract. Other vitiating factors include:

<doc id="56665671" url="?curid=56665671" title="Georgenstraße">
Georgenstraße

The Georgenstraße is a street in Munich, Germany and runs in an east-west direction north of the city center. It separates the Maxvorstadt in the south from Schwabing in the north. It leads from Leopoldstraße in the east to Lothstraße in the west. In the street, especially at the beginning are several magnificent buildings, in the western direction are simple rental units. The Georgenstraße has little traffic significance and it is quiet despite its relative proximity to the city center; apartments, small shops, cafes and other small businesses are found there.
History.
The closed development of Maxvorstadt in the middle of the 19th century, extended from the city center only to the Adalbertstraße, a southern parallel street of Georgenstraße. The Georgenstraße was created between agricultural land areas and was initially referred to as "Tambosi-Anger". Since 1851, the plots were parceled along this dirt road, the way served since then as a shortcut or "Schleichweg" between the Leopoldstraße and the Nordendstraße.
On 13 November 1856, the mayor Kaspar von Steinsdorf in the police report announced that from 21 November 1856 the connection route should be known as Georgenstraße. The question of name sake and meaning remains unclear. Karl Rambaldi explains that the road in the direction of the former swimming school, in the Georgenschwaige in Riesenfeld 2 would have led to the name. Zauner also speak for this naming. Dollinger left the name to this day unchanged.
The Georgenstraße formed, for a long time, the northernmost east-west road on Munich city, in front of the Burgfriedensgrenze to the, then independent, village of Schwabing. From the address book for Munich of 1859, houses numbered 1 to 17 were listed.
Also, a subsequent address book from 1861 lists the then local residents and the buildings and assigns them to the municipality Maxvorstadt.
In the years from 1866 to 1891, the Georgenstraße was extended to just before the Winzererstraße around the newly created building groups, starting from the Türkengraben in the western direction to allow a connection point. From then on, it also crosses the district of Schwabing.
Starting in 1873, the area between Adalbertstraße, Georgenstraße, the then Schwabinger Landstraße (now Leopoldstraße) and the Türkengraben (today Nordendstraße) was developed by a construction company.
With the incorporation of Schwabing in 1890, the Georgenstraße formed the northern boundary of Maxvorstadt to the new district of Schwabing, before the border line to Schwabing was further north along the present Hohenzollernstraße, Ainmillerstraße and Elisabethstraße. Due to the border function of the road between Maxvorstadt and Schwabing, currently the odd numbered houses are in Maxvorstadt and the houses with even numbers are in Schwabing.
Even in 1905, the Georgenstraße formed the northern boundary of the settlement of Maxvorstadt, since between the Georgenstraße and the Hohenzollernstraße were only sporadic buildings.
Cartography.
In the plan of the royal capital and residence state Munich, in all its truce shown from 1858/59, the Georgenstraße is completely noted. In the fourth edition of Meyers Conversations Lexicon of 1888, the Georgenstraße can be seen in sections on the map of Munich from Leopoldstraße. In the fourteenth edition of the Brockhaus Conversation Lexicon of 1891, the street is already presented with a sizeable number of buildings.
Transport history.
Until 1906, the tram line crossed the Georgenstraße with a yellow and red light from the stop Schleißheimer / Georgenstraße to the East Cemetery. After the conversion of the line colors to "Arabic" line numbers from 12 October 1906, this became the line number 7. Also starting from this time, the line 17 traveled in a deviating direction from the line 7 up to the east cemetery. Since 1904, the line 8 travels to the Riesenfeld in Milbertshofen. A separate track along the Georgenstraße never existed. However, in 1917 at the house group Schleißheimer road, coming from the Görresstraße on to the Georgenstraße and Zentnerstraße a reverse loop was constructed, but this was not rebuilt after the war.
Historical buildings.
Directly on the Georgenstraße are 37 historical monuments.

Charlotte station (Michigan Central Railroad)

Charlotte station is a former railroad depot located at 430 North Cochran Avenue in Charlotte, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 as Michigan Central Railroad Charlotte Depot. It has been refurbished as a restaurant, and now houses Don Tequilla's Mexican Grill.
History.
Charlotte was first incorporated as a village in 1863, and in 1868 the Grand River Valley Railroad (GRVRR) constructed the first railroad line through the village. The railroad constructed the first depot in Charlotte that same year. In 1870, the GRVRR was folded in to the larger Michigan Central Railroad. Also in 1870, the Peninsular Railway constructed a second line through the village with its own depot. By 1880, Peninsular was part of the Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway.
By the early 20th century, the Michigan Central decided to replace the 1868 GRVRR depot. Although the reason for the replacement is not known, it is likely that the older depot was too small to handle the required volume of passengers and freight passing through the station. Michigan Central tasked the Detroit architectural firm of Spier &amp; Rohns, who designed nearly all the company's depots between 1884 and 1913, to design a new depot in Charlotte in 1901. N.J. Rogers of Detroit was the contractor for the construction, and the new depot opened to passengers in July 1902. For a time, the 1868 depot was retained to handle freight, allowing the new depot to cater exclusively to passengers. The depot served passengers until it closed in about 1948.
After its closure, the Miller family of Eaton Rapids purchased the building and refurbished it into a restaurant and ice cream parlor. The building continued to be used as a restaurant under several owners. It now houses Don Tequilla's Mexican Grill.
Description.
The former Michigan Central Railroad Charlotte Depot is a long single-story building constructed of light reddish-brown brick with stone trim, with multiple hipped roofs. It is basically rectangular, measuring 108 feet by 26 feet, with the addition of a large rectangular bay on the street side and an apsidal extension at one end. The roof is covered with clay tile, and has widely extending eaves.
The interior of the building originally contained a main waiting area, a ladies' waiting area, and a baggage room. When refurbished into a restaurant, the floor plan was maintained, with the main waiting area and ladies' waiting area serving as the dining room, while the baggage area and a portion of the main waiting area serving as the kitchen. The ticket counter serves as the cash register area.

The plan was also intended to remedy a deficiency in cruisers that had been revealed during training exercises in the 1880s. As such, the "Catinat"-class cruisers were intended to operate as fleet scouts and in the French colonial empire. The ships were armed with a main battery of four guns supported by ten guns and they had a top speed of .
"Catinat" served briefly with the Northern Squadron in 1898 and 1899 before being placed in reserve; thereafter, she and "Protet" served the entirety of their active careers abroad. "Protet" was sent to the Pacific in 1899 after being completed, and she remained there through 1905 to protect French interests. "Catinat" was sent on a brief stint to French Madagascar in 1901 through at least 1902, before returning to France at some point before 1905. Early that year, she was sent to the Pacific to replace her sister ship, remaining there through at least 1908. No records of her activities thereafter survive. That year, "Protet" was converted into a training ship for the Gunnery School, though she was sold for scrap in 1910. "Catinat" was discarded the following year.
Design.
In the late 1880s, the Italian (Royal Navy) accelerated construction of ships for its fleet and reorganized its most modern ironclad battleships—the and es—into a fast squadron suitable for offensive operations. These developments provoked a strong response in the French press. The Budget Committee in the French Chamber of Deputies began to press for a "two-power standard" in 1888, which would see the French fleet enlarged to equal the combined Italian and German fleets, then France's two main rivals on the continent. This initially came to nothing, as the supporters of the doctrine called for a fleet largely based on squadrons of torpedo boats to defend the French coasts rather than an expensive fleet of ironclads. This view had significant support in the Chamber of Deputies.
The next year, a war scare with Italy led to further outcry to strengthen the fleet. To compound matters, the visit of a German squadron of four ironclads to Italy confirmed French concerns of a combined Italo-German fleet that would dramatically outnumber their own. Training exercises held in France that year demonstrated that the slower French fleet would be unable to prevent the faster Italian squadron from bombarding the French coast at will, in part because it lacked enough cruisers (and doctrine to use them) to scout for the enemy ships.
To correct the weaknesses of the French fleet, on 22 November 1890, the Superior Council authorized a new construction program directed not at simple parity with the Italian and German fleets, but numerical superiority. In addition to twenty-four new battleships, a total of seventy cruisers were to be built for use in home waters and overseas in the French colonial empire. The "Catinat" class were ordered to as part of the program, and they were based on the earlier . The "Catinat"-class ships were intended to operate in France's overseas colonies.
General characteristics and machinery.
The ships of the "Catinat" class were long between perpendiculars and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of . displaced , while displaced . "Protet" suffered from stability problems and had to have ballast added, accounting for her greater displacement.
Like most French warships of the period, the "Catinat"-class cruisers' hulls had a pronounced ram bow, tumblehome shape, and a short forecastle deck. Below the waterline, the hulls were covered in a layer of wood and copper sheathing to protect them from biofouling on long voyages overseas. The ships had a minimal superstructure, consisting primarily of a small conning tower and a bridge. They were originally to have been fitted with heavy military masts, but during construction, these were replaced with lighter pole masts with spotting tops for observation and signaling purposes. Their crew numbered 400 officers and enlisted men.
The ships' propulsion system consisted of a pair of vertical triple-expansion steam engines driving two screw propellers. Steam was provided by sixteen coal-burning Belleville-type water-tube boilers that were ducted into two funnels. Their machinery was rated to produce normally, and up to using forced draft, for a top speed of . In service, both cruisers were capable of for a speed of . Coal storage amounted to , which allowed them to steam for at a speed of .
Armament and armor.
The "Catinat"-class vessels were armed with a main battery of four Modèle 1893 45-caliber guns. They were placed in individual sponsons clustered amidships, two guns per broadside. They were supplied with a variety of shells, including solid, cast iron projectiles, and explosive armor-piercing (AP) and semi-armor-piercing (SAP) shells that weighed and , respectively. The guns fired with a muzzle velocity of .
The main battery was supported by a secondary battery of ten Modèle 1891 guns, which were carried in a variety of mounts. Two guns fitted with gun shields were placed side-by-side in pivot mounts on the upper deck, four more were in the upper deck forward in casemates. Another pair of guns were in sponsons further aft, and the remaining pair were in pivot mounts on the upper deck aft. The guns fired cast iron and AP shells with a muzzle velocity of . 
For close-range defense against torpedo boats, they carried ten 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and four 1-pounder guns, all in individual pivot mounts. They were also armed with two torpedo tubes in their hulls above the waterline. They had a capacity to carry fifty naval mines, which were stored in the compartment for the steering engine. A rail extended aft, through the captain's cabin, to a port in the stern, where the mines could be dropped into the ships' wake.
Armor protection consisted of a curved armor deck that was thick on the flat portion, curving down at the sides, where it increased in thickness to . Toward the bow and stern, the deck was reduced slightly to . Above the deck, a cellular layer of watertight compartments was intended to contain flooding below the waterline. A light splinter deck covered the propulsion machinery spaces to protect them from shell fragments that penetrated the main armor deck. The gun shields for the deck-mounted 100 mm guns were thick. The ships had plating on the conning tower.
Service history.
"Catinat" was assigned to the Northern Squadron in 1898, where she conducted training exercises with the rest of the unit. During maneuvers that year, she accidentally ran aground, but was not seriously damaged in the incident. She served in the unit for less than a year before being transferred to the reserve fleet. "Protet" was sent to the Pacific Ocean for a lengthy deployment after her completion in 1899. She helped suppress a fire in the United States in 1900 and protected French interests in Colombia during a conflict in the country in 1901. "Catinat" had been recommissioned and sent abroad by 1901, being stationed in French Madagascar. She operated there at least through 1902.
At some point thereafter, "Catinat" was recalled home and decommissioned once more. In early 1905, she was recommissioned to relieve "Protet", which had also been recalled home that year. "Protet" was converted into a training ship for gun crews at the Gunnery School in 1908, but served in that capacity for just two years. She was struck from the naval register in 1910 and thereafter broken up. "Catinat"s career in the Pacific was uneventful, and she remained on station in the region through 1908. She followed her sister ship to the breakers' yard in 1911.

Charles Lawrence (Liverpool merchant)

Charles Lawrence (1776 – 1853) was a Liverpool merchant who served as Mayor of Liverpool in 1823–4. He is primarily remembered as Chairman of the Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway which opened in 1830.
Early life.
Charles Lawrence was born in 1776 in Albemarle Street, London. He was the son of Richard James Lawrence and his wife Mary (b. Hall). In 1800, he married Rose D'Aguilar, poet and friend of Felicia Hemans.
Business.
The Lawrence family had business interests in the West Indies. It owned the Fairfield Estate in St James, Jamaica which produced variously coffee, sugar, molasses, rum and cattle. In 1830, Charles Lawrence part-inherited 199 slaves from the estate when his father died shortly before the abolition of slavery. He shared compensation with his mother when the slaves were freed. His activities as merchant were conducted from premises in Bridgewater Street, Liverpool, trading as Charles Lawrence &amp; Son, the latter being George Hall Lawrence.
Politics.
Charles Lawrence had Whig political sympathies at the time he was elected Mayor of Liverpool for 1823–4.
Railway interests.
Lawrence was pivotal in the development of the Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway along with others in Liverpool such as Joseph Sandars, Henry Booth and John Moss. Once the Act of Parliament authorised construction, he took over as chairman from John Moss and saw the project through to 1845 when the company merged with the Grand Junction Railway. He also served as Deputy Chairman of the Grand Junction Railway and invested in a number of other railway projects.
Family.
The Lawrence family lived first at Wavertree Hall close to Wavertree Lane railway station. In 1843, the land was acquired by the Corporation and ultimately formed the basis of Wavertree Park. Around 1839, the Lawrences moved to Carnatic Hall, Mossley Hill (the hall was destroyed by fire in 1891) where in 1847, they entertained Prime Minister Robert Peel during his visit to Liverpool to unveil Gibson's statue of William Huskisson MP in front of the new Custom House (Huskisson had died due to an accident on the opening day of the Liverpool &amp; Manchester railway). One of his three sons, George Hall Lawrence, was Mayor of Liverpool at this time.
Charles Lawrence died in 1853.

The Ethnographic Museum of Ripoll is a museum in the city of Ripoll, province of Girona in Catalonia.
In 1929 the Archive of Folk Museum Ripoll was founded in the attic of the old church of Sant Pere, the first Catalan museum dedicated to ethnography. Over the last seventy years it has continuously collected, preserved, studied and promoted the heritage of the local region.
The result is the Ethnographic Museum of Ripoll, and after ten years of refurbishments it opens its doors again to continue enriching its collection and once again display its legacy. The exhibitions can help us understand local society through its material and non-material culture, which include collections relating to shepherds, farmers, craftsmen, religion, and the Catalan forge that produced wrought iron and firearms for the Ripoll region.
The new building, opened in March 2011, invites adults and children to take a tour of the recent past and the identity of the region, as well as a way of living and feeling.

Alan M. Hunt

Alan M Hunt is a British wildlife artist. Born in Redcar, in the northeast of England, he has been painting for nearly 60 years and is best known for his photorealism style and paintings of endangered animals.
Hunt spent much of his career on field trips to enable him to study animals in their natural environments. Much of Alan's artwork reflects the wildlife he observed around the world. He has photographed much of his own reference material during his time in Africa, including safari in Kruger National Park in South Africa, Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya, the Okavango Delta in Botswana, and the Serengeti in Tanzania. He was invited to join a team of artists in residence as lead painter on a Sea Safari around the Antarctic Peninsula. Hunt has additionally travelled to Alaska and Yellowstone National Park in the US, and Guatemala, India, Nepal, and Madagascar.
Alan has been a featured artist in several books and exhibitions, is often cited as a source of inspiration by other artists
In addition to supporting conservation activities, in 2017 Hunt donated a selection of original artwork and limited edition prints to the Mayor of Redcar and Cleveland to be sold for charity.
