Naissance d'une cité

 Naissance d'une cité was a "popular spectacle" held at the Vélodrome d'hiver on 18 October 1937 as part of the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne. The auteur for the event was Jean-Richard Bloch.
The spectacle was based around the story of an oil-rich colony led by an engineer which was threatened by an imperialist power. However, following the intervention of the League of Nations, there was a decision to pool the world's resource and an era of endless peace was ushered in. The drama unrolled to the sound of horns and sirens, radio news flashes and during the finale not only were there wrestling matches and athletic events, but the cycle track of the Vélodrome d'hiver was used for a cycle race. There was a chorus — achieved by amplifying the voice of radio announcer, but original plans to project a film onto a big screen were dropped, in favour of an enormous backdrop designed by Fernand Léger. A copy of this backdrop, entitled "La Naissance d'une cité", was dedicated by Léger to Jean-Richard Bloch. It fetched €93,600 when auctioned at Christie's in 2005.
The score included contributions from Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud and Jean Wiener.
The plot was adjusted to fit the publicised optimism of the sponsors, the French Popular Front government. The story concerned a group of workers trapped in a monotonous job who plan to set up a utopian community on an Island in the Atlantic ocean.
In 2006 the Groupe Études Jean-Richard Bloch republished the book, "Naissance d'une cité", related to the original show.

Albert Emil Davies (16 November 1875 – 18 July 1950) was a British politician and writer.
Born in London, Davies became active in the Fabian Society. There, he was the most vocal advocate of nationalisation, his early works including "The Nationalisation of Railways" and "State Purchase of Railways". In 1911, he was elected to the executive of the Fabian Society, and his 1914 book "The State in Business" brought him to wider public attention. In 1913, he became City Editor of the "New Statesman", holding the post until 1931.
Davies was appointed to London County Council as a Labour Party alderman in 1919, and devoted much of his life to the body. He was its deputy chairman in 1926/7, vice-chairman in 1937/8, and finally chaired the council in 1940/1. He also stood for Parliament, unsuccessfully contesting Romford at the 1922, 1923 and 1924 United Kingdom general elections, and Manchester Moss Side at the 1931 general election.

Margrave Fountain (Bayreuth)

The Margrave Fountain (German: "Markgrafenbrunnen") is a fountain in Bayreuth, Germany. It was built as a monument for Margrave Christian Ernest of Brandenburg-Bayreuth after he had participated in the liberation of Vienna, which had been besieged by the Turks in 1683. The Margrave's equestrian statue is placed in the centre of the fountain, surrounded by other sculpture groups representing the four known continents as well as four rivers rising in the Fichtel Mountains.
The fountain was designed by German sculptor Elias Räntz in 1699-1705 by order of Margrave Christian Ernest. It was placed in the outer courtyard of the Old Castle, today it stands in front of the New Castle ("Neues Schloss").
The equestrian statue.
Sitting on his horse, Margrave Christian Ernest is depicted wearing an armour. Beneath his horse, an anguished Turk is lying on the ground. On the other side, the Margrave's court dwarf is holding a shield with the inscription "PIETAS AD OMNIA UTILIS" ("piety is useful for everything"). Originally, both the Margrave's and the dwarf's statue were gilded.
The banner.
The statue is surrounded by a banner. The inscription ""IPSO SERENISS NATAL D. 27. IV L. AN. AET. 56“" forebodes that the fountain had been completed by the Margrave's 56th birthday. Presumably, only the statue was finished by this point. The inscription continues: "PRINCIPIS IS BONVS EST FONS, EX QVO QVATVOR AQVAE ORBIS AD PARTES MOENVS, NABA, SALA, EGRA RVVNT" ("this is the felicitous princely fountain, out of which the rivers Main, Naab, Saale, Eger flow towards the four cardinal directions)."
The text is written as a chronogram: the bold letters are written larger on the banner than the others. If you read them as Roman numerals and sum them up, the result is 1705, the year the fountain has been completed.
The other sculpture groups.
The lower part of the fountain is made up of four sculpture groups, each consisting of a person sitting on a spouting animal. The water flows represent the four rivers rising in the Fichtel Mountains, whose directions of flow match the four cardinal directions. The four sculpture groups also represent the four continents (Europe, Asia, Africa, America). The Native American is sitting on a griffin, as the wildlife of the Americas wasn't known in Europe in the 1700s.

When Wang was 12 years old, she lost her father (he was 33 when he died) and was forced to drop out of school to work so she could support her family. Wang's family could not afford to send her to secondary education. Instead, she enrolled herself in a vocational school and eventually started working as a teacher for primary school-age children.
Education.
With several years of work experience under her belt, Wang studied English literature at a local university's Continuing Education Program. After that, she was granted a full fellowship from Shanghai University while enrolled in a graduate program for English language and literature. Later, she became interested in film and went back to school to study it. She studied communication at Ohio University and holds a master's degree in documentary from New York University's journalism school.
Career and work.
"Hooligan Sparrow".
"Hooligan Sparrow" was Wang's first feature documentary. It tells the story of Chinese human rights activists fighting to bring accountability to government officials who allegedly sexually assaulted several young girls. As Wang films the activists, she becomes the subject of harassment from state actors responding to Wang's efforts to document the work of the activists.
Wang has stated that she created the film because, “I was interested in many, many topics like the healthcare system and the educational system in China because I didn’t go to high school or college in China. Another topic that interested me was sex workers because, like I said, I grew up in a village and I had seen a lot of women from the village who didn’t have access to education and they end up becoming sex workers because they did not have skills, they did not have education and they were really discriminated against. So, I wanted to make a film about the poorest sex workers in the country, but I also knew that it would be hard to get access to them. I’ve known Hooligan Sparrow–her name is Ye Haiyan–for a long time through social media, but I had never seen her in person at the time.”
When creating the film Wang was not aware that this would make her a target for government surveillance, later stating that she "knew very little about the activist world". Wang has noted that her family and friends were followed and interrogated by officers who questioned whether or not they knew her, her whereabouts, and her current actions.
"One Child Nation".
Her 2019 documentary "One Child Nation" examines the consequences of China's one-child policy, which was implemented from 1979 to 2015.
"In the Same Breath".
Her 2021 documentary "In the Same Breath" looks at how the Chinese and American governments reacted to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Major contributions and awards.
Wang's film “Hooligan Sparrow” screened at festivals in over 25 countries including Sundance, Hot Docs, Sheffield, Full Frame, and Human Rights Watch Film Fest. Her film "I Am Another You" premiered at SXSW in 2017 and won the LUNA Chicken &amp; Egg Award for Best Documentary Feature directed by a woman and the SXSW Special Jury Award for Excellence in Documentary Storytelling. Wang is a recipient of the Sundance Documentary Fund and Bertha Britdoc Journalism Fund, Sundance and IFP supported filmmaker. She was also placed on the shortlist for the 2016 Oscar for Feature Length Documentary for "Hooligan Sparrow". Wang was honored by the International Documentary Association with the 2016 Emerging Filmmaker Award. Her third feature, "One Child Nation", won the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary Feature at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. Wang was awarded a 2021 Vilcek Prize for Creative Promise in Filmmaking by the Vilcek Foundation, "for the impact and courage of her riveting documentaries".
Wang was one of 21 recipients of the MacArthur Fellowship in 2020.
In 2021 she was selected as Jury member for BIFF Mecenat Award in 26th Busan International Film Festival to be held in October.
Personal life.
Wang is married and has one child (born c. 2017). She resides in New Jersey.

Battle of Barawa

The Battle of Barawa was an armed military encounter between the Portuguese Empire and the Ajuran Sultanate, in the city of Barawa. The Portuguese staged a landing and achieved their objectives of sacking the city. 
The Battle.
In February 1507, an armada of 16 ships commanded by Tristão da Cunha and assisted by Afonso de Albuquerque docked at Malindi, en route to India via the island of Socotra. The King of Malindi had been a faithful vassal of the Portuguese since the maiden voyage of Vasco da Gama to India in 1497, and at that instance, the King requested assistance from the Portuguese against the hostile cities of Oja, Lamu and Barawa. Oja was sacked and Lamu was subjugated without a fight.
Upon reaching Barawa, the Portuguese first asked the city to submit without a fight, which was refused. The Portuguese made ready to assault the city, and reported that its defences included a wall and 4,000 men ready to fight.
The following morning, Tristão da Cunha and Afonso de Albuquerque led two assault groups ashore. 2,000 men sallied forth to fight the Portuguese on the beach, but were driven back to the city. Coming under attack from fire arrows, the Portuguese scaled the wall at a weak point and the defences were breached. Many inhabitants fled, but those who remained perished in the fight. The city was then sacked and put to the torch, while the survivors watched from afar. Afterwards the Portuguese proceeded to Socotra Island. 
After the attack, the city of Barawa was quickly rebuilt.

YGG (group)

YGG (You Get Grime, formerly Young Grime Gods) are a trio of grime MCs. The group consists of founding members Saint P and PK (born Alexander Denzil Bamidale Johnson-Cole), both of whom are from Camden, and later addition Lyrical Strally (born Mluleki David Mvubu), who was born in Ealing and raised in Sunbury-on-Thames. The group have released music through Logan Sama's Keepin' It Grimy label, and are currently signed to Flowdan's label SpentShell. They have received extensive airplay on Rinse FM, BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra and NTS, and have supported AJ Tracey on tour. In 2017, they appeared at several festivals including Glastonbury, Cambridge's Strawberries and Creem and Bristol's Love Saves the Day. In 2018, they played at Detonate Festival in Nottingham, Helios Festival in Corfu, Pop-Kultur in Germany, and Outlook Festival in Croatia.
Career.
2006–2010: Formation as YRS and transformation into YGG.
In an interview with Big Zuu on Radar Radio's "Joints Show" on 27 July 2016, PK explained how the group originated as a five-member crew in 2006, until several members dropped out. He and Saint met Lyrical Strally years later through Novelist at a cypher. PK and Lyrical Strally met again by a chance encounter in a nightclub queue, and discovered that they were both attending Kingston University (studying Music Performance and Criminology &amp; Sociology respectively). Strally was invited to join the group as their third member.
From youth centre days... I've known Saint from primary school first of all... From there, first got into spitting and that... Originally, it was a crew called YRS. Young Rebel Soldiers... Saint wasn't there when we made that decision, so Saint come back and he was like "ras, I wanna call it YGG". Originally, there was like five members of it still... I'm not gonna tell you their names... They're my bredrins, innit... From there, obviously certain man took it seriously and that, and certain man fell off and that... We met Strally through Nov... One time I was on this uni ting... I was going there now and I seen L Esser, I was like "what?" In the rave, in the queue, I was like "what you doing here, fam?" He was like "man goes uni here!" I said "what? Link up!" Bam. I swear down, we didn't even go to no classes after that, fam, just chilling up in the park, blazing loudies... I was already going radio with Saint... and then from there... I said "yo, Strally boy, come to our side, please?" And that was it, YGG.
2010–2015: Career beginnings.
Strally's first performance on live radio was on pirate station Empire. PK and Saint have recorded music together since 2010, originally operating in a studio in Kilburn. Songs dating back to 2011 are available on PK's SoundCloud account, including "Shut Your Mouth", "Live", "Radio", "We Spit Greeze" and "Worth the Wait". In 2015, they appeared on West London MC AJ Tracey's breakthrough project "The Front", on the track "Red Bull".
2015–present: Breakthrough and "World Domination".
The group's debut single, "Okay", was self-released on 19 September 2015, and premiered via "FACT". Joseph 'JP' Patterson, senior editor of "Complex UK", wrote of the song: "It's a bouncy number... somewhat jovial... there's now plenty of room for a group like this in the market." Reviewing the song for "The Quietus", Tomas Fraser observed "how different their individual styles are; Lyrical Strally, quick-witted with clear, solid diction; Saint, skippy and fast-paced (if a little erratic at times) and PK, a loud, confident, reload-friendly MC with a reputation for turning raves upside down already under his belt." YGG's second single, "Don't Talk Like That" was self-released on 5 January 2016. The song was premiered by "i-D", and a remix featuring guest vocals from Spitz, Mic Ty, Big Zuu, Jay Amo and AJ Tracey was released in June of the same year.
In 2017, the group signed to BBC and Rinse FM DJ Logan Sama's record label, Keepin' It Grimy. They released a standalone single entitled "Bad" on 31 March, which was hailed by "Pigeons and Planes" as an "instant underground anthem". The trio released their debut extended play, "World Domination", on 28 November 2017 through Keepin' It Grimy. The project features six group tracks as well as a solo track from each artist, and was preceded by the single "Three IC3s" and the promotional single "Lyca".
In 2018, the group signed to Flowdan's record label and management company, SpentShell. PK released his four-track debut solo EP, "The Bad Ombré", with the label on 2 February 2018. In an interview with "Notion", the other two group members revealed that they too have been working on solo content: Lyrical Strally has a forthcoming song entitled "I Finesse", while Saint mentioned a song entitled "On To". On 27 April 2018, they released the standalone single "Strikers" through Astral Black, featuring production from Jon Phonics and Impey.

Gaius Paccius Africanus

Gaius Paccius Africanus was a Roman senator and "delator" or informer, who was active during the reigns of Nero and Vespasian. He was suffect consul from July to August 66 as the colleague of Marcus Annius Afrinus. 
Steven Rutledge, in his study on "delatores" of this period, suggests Africanus was born in the middle of Tiberius' reign, "probably no earlier than 27". An inscription found at Terracina, possibly his tombstone, lists some local offices he held, which included serving as "decemvir ad hastam" (a judicial position), and sponsoring games held in honor of "Honos et Virtus".
According to Tacitus, Africanus had denounced the brothers Publius Sulpicius Scribonius Proculus and Publius Sulpicius Scribonius Rufus to the emperor Nero; they were suffect consuls in 56. As Dio Cassius tells the tale, at the time both were administering Germania Inferior and Germania Superior when Nero summoned them to Achaea for some misleading reason, only to be charged under the "lex maiestas", and, unable to defend themselves, both committed suicide. After the death of Nero, when the chaos of the Year of the Four Emperors had settled, Africanus was prosecuted for his role in the deaths of the brothers Sulpicii Scribonii; unable to either confess or deny the fact, he instead implicated Quintus Vibius Crispus as also involved in the matter. In the aftermath, he was physically ejected from the Curia Julia.
Despite his disreputable history, Africanus was able to remain on good enough terms with the emperor Vespasian that he was allowed to participate in the sortition and be proconsular governor of Africa for the term 77/78. He went on to be "patronus municipii", most likely of Hippo Regius.

Santuario de Guadalupe

The Santuario de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe is a historic Catholic shrine in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It is the oldest church in the United States dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe and is listed on the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties. It is also a contributing property in the Santa Fe Historic District.
The church is a simple cruciform building with thick adobe walls and has been remodeled several times, most recently in the 1970s.
History.
The church was built sometime between the late 1700s and early 1800s, though its exact date of construction is unknown. The records of the Archdiocese of Santa Fe suggest it was built around 1795, as a license authorizing its construction was issued that year. However, the church's existence was not definitively documented until 1821. Conversely, at least one source claimed the church is much older, dating to before the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, though this is probably apocryphal. The famous altar screen depicting Our Lady of Guadalupe, transported in pieces from Mexico City over the Camino Real, is signed by José de Alcíbar and dated 1783.
The church remained active until the 1830s, but by the time the U.S. Army occupied the city in 1846, it was little-used and in disrepair. A visitor in 1881, John Gregory Bourke, wrote
At the time of Bourke's description, the church was only being used once a year for the festival of Our Lady of Guadalupe on December 12. However, after the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad arrived in Santa Fe in 1880, Archbishop Jean-Baptiste Lamy arranged to have it repaired to serve the new English-speaking population brought by the railroad. A native of France, Lamy preferred European architectural styles over the local adobe vernacular and had the church remodeled with a pitched roof and steeple starting in 1881.
On June 27, 1922, the steeple and roof were destroyed by a fire that also damaged the interior, though the altar screen survived. The church was then rebuilt in the Mission Revival style with curved parapets and a tiled roof. It was remodeled again in 1976–78 to bring it closer to the original appearance, though some of the Mission details remain in place. Since the opening of a new church next door in 1961, it is no longer an active parish church but is still used for monthly masses.

The Central Military Band of the Korean People's Army (), also sometimes known as the Korean People's Army Marching Band or DPRK Army Orchestra is a North Korean musical group/marching band based in Pyongyang and is the sole military band of the Korean People's Army. The Women's Military Marching Band of the Ministry of People's Security of the DPRK is the all-female unit of the central band.
History.
On February 23, 1946, the Military Band of the Pyongyang Military School was created, which became the predecessor of the Band of the Korean People's Army. Its first performance was at the inaugural ceremony of the Pyongyang Institute founded by President Kim Il Sung. In June 1950, it became the Band of the Ministry of People's Security, and later that year, the band became attached as a unit of the Supreme Guard Command's Honor Guard Battalion. By September 1954, full control of the band was given to the Ministry of Public Security, serving for the remainder of the Cold War and the 1990s before being reorganized into a separate entity in June 1998 as a directly reporting unit of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, tasked as the primary unit for the military music activities throughout the whole KPA.
Activities.
The CMB-KPA, as the premier and principal band of the whole KPA, presides over all garrison and unit bands within the KPA's service branches and the Worker-Peasant Red Guards. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has described the band as one that is "instilling revolutionary enthusiasm and fighting spirit into all the service personnel and people."
The band is similar to United States college marching bands in that they both solely specialize in military style marching, notably during ceremonial parades and public performances. The band has been known to play Pop, Brass &amp; Military music during many of its performances.

IRNSS-1I

IRNSS-1I is the eighth satellite in the Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System (IRNSS) series of satellites, in reality, IRNSS - 1I is the ninth satellite that launched in IRNSS constellation but it is counting as eighth satellite because IRNSS - 1I is an eighth satellite that has launched successfully in IRNSS constellation. ISRO already launched IRNSS-1A, IRNSS-1B, IRNSS-1C, IRNSS-1D, IRNSS-1E, IRNSS-1F, IRNSS-1G and IRNSS-1H. The satellite is intended to replace the failed IRNSS-1A, and complete the constellation of geosynchronous navigation satellites after IRNSS-1H failed to do so. The satellite's assembly, integration and testing is partly done by a consortium of six small firms led by Alpha Design Technologies, a Bengaluru-based aerospace firm under URSC's supervision.
Payload.
Like its predecessor, IRNSS-1I has two types of payloads, navigation payload and the ranging payload. The navigation payload transmits navigation service signals to the users. This payload is operating in L5 band and S band. A highly accurate Rubidium atomic clock is part of the navigation payload of the satellite. Failure of these Rubidium atomic clocks was the reason for IRNSS-1A to be deemed unfit. The ranging payload consists of transponder which is operated in CDMA mode for two-way range measurements. The IRNSS satellites continuously emits time stamped navigation signals, which are received by the ground-based user receivers. The information is then processed by the receivers to derive their own position, velocity and time. The system provides seamless, uninterrupted services under all weather conditions.
Satellite.
The satellite will help in completing the satellite based navigation system of India which is currently under development. The IRNSS space segment consists of seven satellites. After the failure of all three Rubidium Atomic clocks on-board IRNSS-1A and the failure of IRNSS-1H to separate from the heat shield of the launch vehicle, IRNSS constellation remains incomplete without this satellite. This independent regional navigation satellite system is developed by India and is similar to Global Positioning System (GPS) of the US, which has 31 satellites currently in orbit.
Launch.
IRNSS-1I was successfully launched by 43rd flight of PSLV (PSLV-C41) in XL configuration on 11 April 2018.

Cosmic-Ray Extremely Distributed Observatory (CREDO) is a scientific project initiated at the end of August 2016 by Polish scientists from the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Kraków (researchers from the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary also joined the project) whose purpose is the detection of cosmic rays and the search for dark matter. Its aim is to involve as many people as possible in the construction of a global system of cosmic ray detectors, from which it will be possible to examine the essence of dark matter. Having a camera and a GPS module, a smartphone works well as a detector of particles from space.
Objective.
The main objective of CREDO is the detection and analysis of extended cosmic ray phenomena, so-called super-preshowers (SPS), using existing as well as new infrastructure (cosmic-ray observatories, educational detectors, single detectors etc.). The search for ensembles of cosmic ray events initiated by SPS is yet an untouched topic, in contrast to the current state-of-the-art analysis, which is focused on the detection of single cosmic ray events. Theoretical explanation of SPS could be given either within classical (e.g., photon-photon interaction) or exotic (e.g., Super Heavy Dark Matter decay or annihilation) scenarios, thus detection of SPS would provide a better understanding of particle physics, high energy astrophysics and cosmology. The ensembles of cosmic rays can be classified based on the spatial and temporal extent of particles constituting the ensemble. Some classes of SPS are predicted to have huge spatial distribution, a unique signature detectable only with a facility of global size. Since development and commissioning of a completely new facility with such requirements is economically unwarranted and time-consuming, the global analysis goals are achievable when all types of existing detectors are merged into a worldwide network. The idea to use the instruments in operation is based on a novel trigger algorithm: in parallel to looking for neighbour surface detectors receiving the signal simultaneously, one should also look for spatially isolated stations clustered in a small time window. On the other hand, CREDO's strategy is also aimed at an active engagement of a large number of participants, who will contribute to the project by using common electronic devices (e.g. smartphones), capable of detecting cosmic rays. It will help not only in expanding the geographical spread of CREDO, but also in managing a large manpower necessary for a more efficient crowd-sourced pattern recognition scheme to identify and classify SPS. A worldwide network of cosmic-ray detectors could not only become a unique tool to study fundamental physics, it will also provide a number of other opportunities, including space weather or geophysics studies. Among the latter, one can list the potential to predict earthquakes by monitoring the rate of low energy cosmic-ray events. This diversity of potential applications has motivated the researchers to advertise the concept across the astroparticle physics community.
Implementation.
The user must install an application that turns their phone into a cosmic ray detector, connect it to the charger and arrange it horizontally; for example, put it on a table or bedside cabinet. It is also important that the cameras of the device are well covered, for example with a piece of black adhesive tape, and notifications indicated by the blinking of lights are turned off. If a radiation particle passes through a photosensitive matrix in the phone, it will stimulate several pixels, which will be noticed by the program that sends information to the server. Thanks to the GPS module, the time and place of the event is also known. 
All data from smartphones will then be analyzed together in the Academic Computer Center Cyfronet AGH, which will keep participants informed about the progress of the search for signs of high-energy particles.
By 2020 the application is still under testing and may not produce the expected results on some mobile devices.
Preview of collected data.
All traces of particles registered by smartphones can be viewed on a dedicated website. Their size and shape depends on the type and energy of the captured particle and the direction from which it came.

The Zürich ePrix was a race of the single-seater, electrically powered Formula E championship on the Zürich Street Circuit. It was one of three races to debut during the 2017–18 Formula E season. It was also the first race in Switzerland since 1954, thanks in part to an amendment to Swiss law in 2015 to allow electric motor racing. The 2018 race was sponsored by Julius Baer. Zürich was replaced with the Swiss ePrix in Bern as the Swiss venue on the schedule for the 2018–19 season.

The Sexual Politics of Meat

The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory is a 1990 book written by Carol J. Adams, in which she develops her vegetarian-feminist, pacifist, intersectional critical theory. The book was first written as an essay for a college course taught by Mary Daly and includes material such as interviews from vegetarian feminists in the Boston-Cambridge area. "The Sexual Politics of Meat" has been translated into nine languages and re-published for its 25th anniversary edition as a part of the "Bloomsbury Revelations" series.
Summary.
The book is composed of three parts, "The Patriarchal Texts of Meat", "From the Belly of Zeus", and "Eat Rice, Have Faith in Women", as well as an epilogue entitled "Destabilizing Patriarchal Consumption". In these sections Adams looks at the connections between as well as the comparisons of ingrained cultural misogyny and what Adams sees as an obsession with the consumption of meat and masculinity.
Reception.
"The Sexual Politics of Meat" has been reviewed by multiple outlets, which includes the "NWSA Journal," "Etnofoor," and "The Women's Review of Books." In a 2010 article for "The Guardian", Nina Power wrote that "It's 20 years since "the Sexual Politics of Meat" was published, yet it is still as relevant as ever".

Open access in Belgium

In Belgium, open access to scholarly communication accelerated after 2007 when the University of Liège adopted its first open-access mandate. The "Brussels Declaration" for open access was signed by officials in 2012.
The presence of many Belgium research organizations to the Berlin Declaration on Open access, and the creation of Immediate Deposit and Optional Access mandate at ULG in 2007, led to the Brussels Declaration on Open Access signed in 2012 by the Minister of research. This Declaration enabled Belgium to have a broad network of institutional open-access repositories by circulating the results to Belgian academic and scientific research.
Repositories.
There are some 23 collections of scholarship in Belgium housed in digital open access repositories. They contain journal articles, book chapters, data, and other research outputs that are free to read. The Université catholique de Louvain, Ghent University's "Academic Bibliography", and University of Liège's "Orbi" hold many publications.
BELSPO open research data mandate.
The BELSPO (Belgian Federal Science Policy Office) mandate was introduced on 21 November 2019. The policy aims at complying with the FAIR data principles in a more sustainable manner, and is applicable to digital data whose collection has been funded either partially or entirely by the BELSPO. The Data management plan (DMP) was to be integrated in March 2020.

2021 Copa América

The 2021 Copa América was the 47th edition of the Copa América, the international men's football championship organised by South America's football ruling body CONMEBOL. The tournament took place in Brazil from 13 June to 10 July 2021. The tournament was originally scheduled to take place from 12 June to 12 July 2020 in Argentina and Colombia as the 2020 Copa América. On 17 March 2020, CONMEBOL announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic in South America, the tournament had been postponed for a year, in conjunction with UEFA's decision to also postpone UEFA Euro 2020 to 2021. This was the first time since 1991 where no guest nation took part in the tournament.
On 20 May 2021, Colombia was removed as co-host amid ongoing protests against President Iván Duque Márquez, and Argentina was then removed on 30 May due to COVID-19 issues. The following day CONMEBOL confirmed Brazil as the new host of the tournament.
Hosts Brazil were the title holders, having won their ninth title in 2019, which they also hosted. Argentina won their fifteenth title after defeating Brazil 1–0 in the final, their first senior title since the 1993 edition of the same tournament. They also equalled Uruguay's overall record of Copa América titles.
Background.
In March 2017, CONMEBOL reportedly proposed that the Copa América take place in 2020 as part of a calendar change. Following the 2019 edition in Brazil, the quadrennial tournament would move from odd to even years starting in 2020, with the following edition taking place in Ecuador in 2024. This would move the tournament in line with the UEFA European Championship, which is also held in even years with a 2020 edition taking place. Reports suggested that the United States may host the tournament, having previously held the one-off Copa América Centenario in 2016, which celebrated the centenary of CONMEBOL and the Copa América. On 18 September 2018, plans for a calendar change were confirmed by CONMEBOL president Alejandro Domínguez after submitting an official request to FIFA.
On 26 October 2018 at the FIFA Council meeting in Kigali, Rwanda, the request was approved for the Copa América to take place in even years, starting with the 2020 edition. The tournament was originally scheduled to take place between 12 June and 12 July 2020, the same dates as UEFA Euro 2020.
On 13 March 2019, CONMEBOL announced Argentina and Colombia as co-hosts of the 2020 event after the United States bid was rejected. It was officially announced the same day when CONMEBOL approved of the joint hosting. It was officially awarded on 9 April 2019 at the CONMEBOL Congress in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
On 20 May 2021, due to security concerns amid protests against the government of President Iván Duque Márquez, Colombia was dropped as co-host of the tournament.
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic in South America began impacting football. FIFA announced that the first two rounds of the South American qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup, due to take place in March, were postponed, while CONMEBOL temporarily suspended the Copa Libertadores. On 17 March 2020, CONMEBOL announced that the Copa América would be postponed to the following year, taking place from 11 June to 11 July 2021, in order to protect the health and safety of the teams, media, visitors and host cities. On the following day, the Bureau of the FIFA Council approved the date change in the FIFA International Match Calendar. As a result, the expanded FIFA Club World Cup, which was due to take place in June and July 2020, was rescheduled to 2021.
On 22 May 2021, Argentina went under a nine-day lockdown due to soaring COVID-19 cases, which included the suspension of all domestic football. On 30 May 2021, CONMEBOL announced that due to the current circumstances in the country, Copa América would be pulled from Argentina, and that they were looking at bids from other countries to host the tournament. This reportedly included a bid from the United States, after that bid was initially rejected. It was reported that the Argentine government had made increasing demands for biosecurity protocols that CONMEBOL found unreasonable. On 31 May Brazil was confirmed as the new host.
All matches in the tournament were held behind closed doors, except the final, where 10% of Maracanã Stadium's capacity was allowed for guests with a negative COVID-19 test before entering. All delegations, each limited to 65 members, were vaccinated, as were the match officials.
Venues.
On 1 June 2021, the Brazilian government and Brazilian Football Confederation announced the cities of Brasília, Goiânia, Cuiabá and Rio de Janeiro as the host venues of the competition, with the Maracanã, Mané Garrincha, Pantanal and the Olímpico stadiums used for matches. On 2 June, the CBF decided to use the Nilton Santos as the second stadium in Rio de Janeiro. The government also allocated resources in the federal budget to provide the necessary support for the CONMEBOL's tournament logistics and security.

Australia would have made their debut appearance in the Copa América, while Qatar would be making their second appearance, having participated in the previous edition. However, on 23 February 2021, Football Australia and the Qatar Football Association announced their withdrawal from the tournament, due to the postponement of the remainder of the AFC Second Round of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification to June 2021. Following the withdrawals, a CONMEBOL spokesperson said that there was a calendar issue that stopped Australia and Qatar, that he had already seen interest from other national teams to play as guests in their place and that he would like to have 12 teams. The spokesperson added that if no replacements were found, the tournament would be played with 10 teams (for the first time since 1991).

Kate Moore Brown

Kate Moore Brown (December 17, 1871 - March 28, 1945) was an American musician, clubwoman and traveler who lived in El Paso, Texas. Brown was one of the first graduates of El Paso High School. She was the first person to teach music in the public schools in Texas and El Paso and was the first woman to own a bicycle in El Paso. Brown is also one of the original creators of the El Paso International Museum which later became the El Paso Museum of Art.
Biography.
Brown was born in Missouri on December 17, 1871. She was raised in Sherman, Texas where she took music lessons at the North Texas Female College. Brown's sister, Francis Moore, would later become a well-known pianist in New York. Brown came to El Paso in 1886 with her family. She served as a bridesmaid for Anne Buford, who married into the Magoffin family in 1887. Brown was in the first graduating class of El Paso High School, and was one of the two graduates in 1887. When she graduated, she went with her father to San Diego, California where she received a second high school diploma from a high school there in 1889.
She returned to El Paso again in 1890, a year after her father died. She then began to teach music in the public schools and was the first person to do so in both El Paso and Texas. Brown was the first woman to own and ride a bicycle in El Paso, Texas. She used the bike to get to the schools she taught at, pedaling through sand in some places. She taught music in the public schools until 1899. She also wrote about the history of music in El Paso.
Brown married William R. Brown, a railroad agent for the Santa Fe railroad, on June 29, 1898. Her husband was a cornet player and also enjoyed music. Kate Moore Brown continued to play piano and organ and also organized various musical groups in El Paso.
Brown joined the El Paso Woman's Club in 1899. She was the head of the El Paso Woman's Club's music department. Brown was also a member of the first board of directors for the El Paso School for Girls (Radford School) in 1910. Also in 1910, Brown became the president of the Woman's Club and held meetings at her home. Later, she was on the executive board of the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs. In 1917, she formed an auxiliary of the Woman's Club devoted to music, called the MacDowell Club, named after Edward MacDowell.
Brown became the second woman elected to the El Paso School Board in 1921. She recalled later that the Ku Klux Klan attempted to infiltrate politics within the board, and she said, "I worked hard as a board member and stood for justice." She later became the state chair of Child Welfare in 1923. Brown helped originate the idea for the El Paso International Museum (later known as the El Paso Museum of Art) in 1925. She served as an organizer for the museum and worked as a chair on the board. In 1933, she was the president of the Pioneer Women's Association.
Brown's husband died in 1934. Kate Moore Brown inherited his estate.
Brown was president of the El Paso Symphony Association and helped get the organization incorporated in 1937. Brown also served on the board for the El Paso Public Library. She was president of the library board in 1936.
Brown collected the fans and shawls belonging to notable women from around the world. Brown donated her collection of over 300 fans to the El Paso International Museum. She died on March 28, 1945.

Myron W. Reed

Myron Winslow Reed (1836–1899) was an American lawyer, Congregationalist minister, and political activist. Reed is best remembered as a leading voice of the social gospel movement in the American West and as the president of the Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth, a utopian socialist organization seeking to establish cooperative colonies.
Early life.
Reed was born July 24, 1836, in Brookfield, Vermont. His father was a minister. He attended the St. Lawrence Academy of Potsdam, New York.
Reed taught school for two academic years, from 1858 to 1860, at Watertown, Wisconsin, studying law during the evenings. He was admitted to the Wisconsin state bar in 1860.
Reed did not feel himself drawn to the legal profession, however, and at the urging of friends he left for Chicago to enroll at the Congregational theological seminary there.
With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Reed put aside his theological studies and enlisted as an officer in the 18th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment, serving as a lieutenant. He would serve four years in the Union Army, gaining promotion to the rank of captain in 1863 and commanding 100 scouts, mustering out only at the end of the war.
Reed was wounded in action in Tennessee when he rode into an ambush, shot in the leg at close range with a shotgun loaded with buckshot. Damage done to his knee in the encounter would afflict Reed for the rest of his life.
In November 1865 Reed resumed his religious studies, preaching in El Paso, Illinois, on weekends.
Congregationalist minister.
Reed's first Congregationalist pastorate was at Hudson, Michigan. This was followed with a stint at Columbus, Wisconsin, before being moved to the Southern metropolis of New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1868. It was there that he met the abolitionist school teacher Louise Lyon, who was a soprano in the church choir. The pair married in 1883.
From New Orleans, Reed was called to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he was made pastor of the Olivet Congregational Church. He would remain in the position for four years, preaching for a time from the stage of a local theater when his church was destroyed in a fire.
Reed's reputation as a spellbinding and thoughtful divine grew and he was called by the First Presbyterian Church of Indianapolis, Indiana, a prosperous congregation which included among its members US President Benjamin Harrison and his wife. He would remain there for seven years before moving to his last city, becoming pastor of the First Congregational Church of Denver, Colorado, in 1884. He felt "that the West, more malleable than the East, offered a fresh opportunity to fulfill the United States' divine mission by creating a just, truly democratic society", "an ideal community worthy of the kingdom of God." He would have a six-month sabbatical over that summer, coming back to head Denver's Broadway Temple congregation, which met each week in the Broadway Theater instead of in a conventional church setting.
Reed became a member of the Knights of Labor circa 1884. In 1886 Reed served as a Democratic congressional candidate. He was nominated again in 1892.
Death and legacy.
Reed was stricken with fatal illness late in January 1899, lapsing into unconsciousness during his final hours. He died at 4:55 am on January 30 in Denver, with physicians listing the cause of death as chronic entero colitis inflammation. Reed was 62 years old at the time of his death.
The memorial service which followed was pointedly addressed by a representative of the three main religious tendencies of Colorado, led by the rabbi W. S. Friedman, the Roman Catholic priest William O'Ryan, and the Protestant minister Barton Aylesworth and addressed by several secular speakers. The Grand Army of the Republic and Masons, two organizations with which Reed was actively involved, were also made part of the proceedings. A committee of six state senators were appointed by Governor Charles S. Thomas, who also paved the way for Reed's body to lie in state in a closed casket at the Colorado State Capitol prior to interment.
Reed was survived by his wife and three children.

She was a member of the Queen's madrigal choir, winners of the New Zealand Choral Federation (Otago) Millennium Trophy for secondary school choirs in 2009.
Career.
At the age of 18, Reid moved to Christchurch and began performing her original songs. Several short EPs followed, and as opportunities to perform nationally arose she moved to Auckland, and then Wellington.
2014–2016: Crowdfunding and release of debut album.
Reid was encouraged to work toward her first full-length album, and was already connected to Lyttelton-based producer Ben Edwards. Without startup capital, Reid set up a PledgeMe campaign, which was given a significant boost after she opened for Tiny Ruins.
This gave her a footing to record and self-release "Listen to Formation, Look for the Signs" at Edwards' Sitting Rooms Studios. In early 2015, Reid was signed to Australian indie label Spunk Records and the album was released officially in Australia and New Zealand. "Listen to Formation, Look for the Signs" was warmly received by critics, and in 2016 was nominated for a Tui award for best folk album and for the Taite Music Prize.
After a period living and playing shows in Australia, Reid returned home to Port Chalmers and began an English Degree at the University of Otago.
"Listen to Formation, Look for the Signs" was quickly licensed for UK, US and European release, which opened the door to Reid’s first tour of the UK and Europe in 2016.
2017–present: World tours and second album.
Before leaving the country for the tour, Reid returned to the Lyttleton studio with Ben Edwards and her backing band where they recorded her sophomore album "Preservation".
The tour was a success, and while in London, Reid was approached with a co-management offer with Melodic Records. This was followed by a publishing deal with Basin Rock Records and an endorsement from Crafter Guitars. Since its release on 3 March 2017, "Preservation" has been met with a positive reception.
Reid opened for Ryan Adams at his sold-out Auckland show on 20 May 2017.
Awards.
Reid’s first single from ‘’Preservation’’, Richard, saw her nominated for the APRA Silver Scroll award in 2017, regarded as New Zealand’s most important songwriting award. Judges described the song as "a stand-out folk-rock gem with its wonderfully direct delivery, charting heartbreak and dissolution, through striking imagery".
Also in 2017, producer Ben Edwards won a New Zealand Music Award for his work on "Preservation", and Reid herself was nominated for Best Solo Artist, Breakthrough Artist of the Year and Best Alternative Artist.
Film and television appearances.
On 26 September 2017, Reid made her UK television debut with her band, appearing on "Later... with Jools Holland" on BBC Two.

Benjamin Cornelius Jr. House

The Benjamin Cornelius Jr. House, also known as the Benjamin Cornelius Jr. and Rachel McKinney Cornelius House, is a historic residence located in Forest Grove, Oregon, United States. It was built around 1873 by carpenter Harley McDonald, one of the first settlers to offer architectural services in Oregon, and is one of only two houses designed by McDonald remaining in Forest Grove. Its Italianate form and Gothic details are highly distinctive in Forest Grove, while its veranda (added around 1900) exhibits Colonial styling. Benjamin and Rachel Cornelius, the first occupants of the house, had crossed the Oregon Trail via the Meek Cutoff in 1845; the Cornelius family was instrumental in the foundation of Hillsboro and the town of Cornelius during their lifetime, and Benjamin was also prominently involved in early real estate transactions in the area. Benjamin was murdered in 1881, during the couple's tenure at this house.
The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, and included as part of the Clark Historic District in 2002.

HMS Kempenfelt (1915)

HMS "Kempenfelt" was a of the British Royal Navy. She was built by the Cammell Laird at their Birkenhead shipyard, with construction starting in 1914 and completed in August 1915. She served through the remainder of the First World War. She was sold for scrap in 1921.
Construction and design.
The British Admiralty issued requests for tenders for two flotilla leaders of the , and "Kempenfelt", in April 1914 as part of the 1914–1915 Naval Estimates, as a follow-on to the orders placed for the two ships of the class in the 1913–1914 Estimates. Flotilla Leaders were large destroyer-type vessels intended to lead flotillas of smaller destroyers in action.
The "Marksman"-class ships were long overall, at the waterline and between perpendiculars. They had a beam of and a draught of . The design displacement was normal and full load, with a displacement of stated for "Nimrod" in 1919. Three sets of Brown-Curtis steam turbines were fed by four Yarrow three-drum boilers, rated at , which gave a speed of . Cruising turbines were fitted to the outer shafts. Four funnels were fitted. Up to 515 tons of oil fuel could be carried, giving a range of at .
The ship's main gun armament consisted of four QF Mk IV guns mounted on the ships centreline, with two of the guns positioned between the ship's funnels. An anti-aircraft armament of two 1-pounder (37 mm) "pom-pom" autocannons was planned, but during construction the 1-pounder pom-poms were diverted to the British Expeditionary Force when it deployed to France at the start of the First World War, and the ship completed with two 2-pounder (40-mm) "pom-pom"s instead. Torpedo armament consisted of two twin 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. In August 1915 "Kempenfelt" was selected for conversion to a fast minelayer, but owing to problems during sea trials, sister ship was selected instead. In 1916, "Kempenfelt" was fitted with an explosive anti-submarine sweep, but this was removed in July that year. The ship's crew was 104 officers and men.
"Kempenfelt" was laid down at Cammell Laird's Birkenhead shipyard on 2 October 1914 and was launched on 1 May 1915. During sea trials, the ships machinery was heavily forced, producing over with speeds of almost . The ship was completed on 20 August 1915.
Service.
On 14 August 1915, while undergoing sea trials in Liverpool Bay, "Kempenfelt" reported sighted the periscope of an unknown submarine, possibly . On 21 August 1915, following commissioning "Kempenfelt" joined the newly established 11th Destroyer Flotilla at Scapa Flow, part of the Grand Fleet, as leader. On 6 January 1916, the pre-dreadnought battleship , which was travelling alone because the severe weather prevented destroyers from keeping pace, struck a mine near Cape Wrath. When reports of the mining reached Scapa Flow, "Kempenfelt" and 12 destroyers were despatched to assist and to protect the stricken battleship from enemy submarines. (It was thought at first that "King Edward VII" had been torpedoed). "Kempenfelt" and a tug took "King Edward VII" but the towline parted and the battleship was abandoned, with her crew being taken off by the destroyers , , and before the battleship sank.
"Kempenfelt" sailed as part of the 11th Destroyer Flotilla at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May–1 June 1916. "Kempenfelt" survived the battle without damage.
"Kempenfelt" remained part of the 11th Flotilla until September 1917, joining the 6th Destroyer Flotilla as part of the Dover Patrol on 15 September, where she served until 2 April 1918, then rejoining the 11th Flotilla. "Kempenfelt" was still a member of the 11th Flotilla at the end of the war. By March 1919, "Kempenfelt" was in reserve at Portsmouth. She was sold for scrap to T W Ward on 9 May 1921 for £2778 and was broken up at Ward's Morecambe yard from August 1921.

The Flight of Mr. McKinley

The Flight of Mr. McKinley () is a 1975 Soviet science fiction film directed by Mikhail Schweitzer.
Plot.
A scientist invents the colloid gas — a creation that allows a person to hibernate for a hundred and more years, and wake up in almost the same physical state as when he was falling asleep.
The colloid gas is immediately used for commercial purposes by Sam Boulder, who creates a Salvatory system; sheltered deep underground, well-equipped storage facilities of those people who want to go to the future - fleeing from incurable disease, boredom, the threat of nuclear war, or simply because of the desire to "remain an eternal champion".
McKinley is a small man, a clerk in one of the advertising bureaus - very fond of children but his dreams of having his own are hampered by an inferiority complex, which manifests itself as a fear of a nuclear war and a world catastrophe. McKinley seeks to escape from the outside world, and from himself.
Once at the press conference of SBS, which creates and maintains a network of salvatories, McKinley draws the attention of one of the top managers of this firm and receives an invitation to visit one of the salvatories to get acquainted with his work. After that, Mr. McKinley, fascinated by the fantastic technology of the salvatories, has only one dream in life - to get into the salvatory and escape to the future. For this he is even ready to commit crime.
He attempts a number of times to get rich in order to buy a treasured ticket to a salvatory, but always ends up failing. At the last moment, McKinley finds a winning lottery ticket, which has the amount required for the purchase of the ticket.
The fantasy comes true - McKinley sleeps for 250 years to wake up later clean, shaved and washed ready to go out into the new world. He does not pay attention to the strange behavior of the hateful and contemptful employees of SBS, who are performing their duties strictly according to the instructions. The elevator takes McKinley to the surface of the Earth but instead of a flowering garden, a world scorched by endless wars waits for him.
But all this turns out to be only a dream. McKinley did not leave his time period, and he acts as he never did before to cure his complexes.
Production.
Film score.
Schweitzer, in the process of reworking Leonov's script so that it would be more suited for the present time, decided to express the author's idea through songs.
Since the film was made in the American style, the idea arose to use the method of end-to-end ballads widely used in American films. The option of inviting Dean Reed was considered, however, Schweitzer's wife came up with the idea of hiring Vladimir Vysotsky.
Vysotsky wrote the ballads, but they were mostly unsuitable for the picture because of their excessive length. Composer of the film's score Schwartz refused to write his own ballads which was why some songs were written by Anatoly Kalvarsky.
Location.
Outdoor scenes of the film were mostly shot in Budapest.

Temple of Juno Lacinia (Crotone)

The Temple of Juno Lacinia (or Hera Lacinia) is a ruined ancient Greek temple dedicated to Hera (Juno) located on Capo Colonna in Calabria, Italy, near Crotone (ancient Kroton). The remaining feature is a Doric column with capital, about in height. Remains of marble roof-tiles have been seen on the spot (Livy xlii.3) and architectural fragments were excavated in 1886–1887 by the Archaeological Institute of America. The sculptures found were mostly buried again, but a few fragments, some decorative terracottas and a dedicatory inscription to Hera of the 6th century BC, in private possession at Crotone, are described by F. von Duhn in "Notizie degli scavi".
The date of the erection of the temple is postulated as 480–440 BC; it is not recorded by any ancient writer. It was reputed to have been founded by Hercules (Herakles) after he killed the bandit Lacinius, who attempted to steal some of the cattle of Geryon.
The temple has been described a "perhaps the most splendid [structure] in southern Italy." The federal treasury of the Italiote League was moved there in the 5th century BC, and remained there until relocated to Herakleia near Tarentum.
Before evacuating Italy in 206 BC, toward the close of the Second Punic War, Hannibal dedicated bronze plaque inscribed in Punic and Greek there detailing his accomplishments. 
In 173 BC, the Censor Quintus Fulvius Flaccus dedicated the Temple of Fortuna Equestris in Rome, for which he had stripped the marble tiles from the roof of the Temple of Juno. In 172, out of grief over tragic news about his sons, Flaccus hanged himself. "[T]here was a general belief that he had been driven mad by Juno Lacinia, in her anger at his spoliation of her temple." The Senate ordered the tiles returned, but, "as there was no one who understood how to replace the tiles they had been left in the precinct of the temple."
Cicero cites Coelius Antipater saying that the temple featured a golden column. Hannibal wanted to know whether or not it was solid gold, and drilled a hole and, determining that it was solid, decided to take it back to Carthage. The next night Juno appeared to him in a dream and threatened him with the loss of his remaining good eye if he took it. Hannibal obeyed the warning; he had a small statue of a heifer—sacred to Juno—cast from the drill shavings and mounted it on top of the column.
The temple was said to have still been fairly complete in the 16th century, but was destroyed to build the episcopal palace at Crotone.

Esther Park (physician)

Esther Pak (, born Kim Jeom-dong ; March 16, 1876 or 1877 — April 13, 1910) was a Korean physician; she was the first Korean woman to practice Western medicine in the country.
Early life.
Kim, Jeom-dong was born on March 16, 1876 (or, according to other sources - March 16, 1877 or 1879) in the Seoul district of Jeong-dong, she was the third of four daughters. Kim's father worked for American missionary Henry Appenzeller. In 1886, he sent his daughter to study at the Ewha Girls' School founded by Mary F. Scranton. Kim's parents allowed her to study under two conditions: she was forbidden to go to the United States, and to leave school prior to marriage.
Kim was a good student, particularly good at English. When American missionary doctor Rosetta Sherwood Hall visited the school, Kim was asked to work as her interpreter. Impressed by doctor Hall's surgery to correct a cleft lip and cleft palate, Kim began to dream of a medical career. Rosetta Hall convinced Kim that Koreans were afflicted by Confucian prohibitions that did not allow them to be properly treated.
Study and career.
Rosetta Sherwood Hall introduced Kim to Pak Yusan (박여선, 朴汝先), who worked with her husband, and on May 24, 1893, Kim Jeom-dong married him at the first Western-style wedding ceremony between Koreans in Korea. After the wedding, she took the name of Esther Pak, adding her husband's name to the name under which she was baptized. In 1894, Sherwood Hall returned to New York, taking Esther and Yusan with her.
Esther Pak graduated from a one-year school in New York where she studied Latin, physics and mathematics. In 1900, Park graduated from the Women's Medical College of Baltimore, as the first Korean woman to earn a medical degree in the United States. Her husband supported Pak's medical education, but he died from tuberculosis, half a year before her graduation.
After obtaining her degree, Pak returned to Korea and settled in the first female hospital in the country, Bogu-yogwan (), in Jeongdon, Seoul. For ten months of work there, Dr. Pak helped more than 3,000 patients, and then in 1901 moved to Pyongyang, where Dr. Hall established a new hospital. Pak traveled all around Korea, including during the cholera epidemic, helping patients free of charge. In addition to the main work, she also conducted educational and teaching activities, teaching the first generation of Korean female doctors. Pak lead public lectures in which she emphasized the importance of health education and education for women, and promoted Christianity.
Esther Pak died of tuberculosis in April 1910, at the age of 34 years.
Honors.
On April 28, 1909, Esther Pak and two other Korean women pioneers were celebrated with a ceremony: Ha Ran-sa, the first woman bachelor in Literature from an American university, and Yun Jeong-won, the first Korean graduate of the Japanese Meiji University (Music); it was attended by 7800 people. Emperor Gojong presented Pak with a silver medal.
Pak was one of the historical figures featured in a missionary pageant titled "A Cloud of Witnesses" by Dora Patterson, performed in Hazleton, Pennsylvania in 1933.
In 2006, the Korean Academy of Sciences inducted Esther Park to the Korean Science and Technology Hall of Fame.
In 2008, the Ewha University Alumni Committee established the Esther Park Medal, which recognizes the merit of women who graduated from the university and became doctors.

Ant Forest

Ant Forest (Chinese: 蚂蚁森林, pinyin: Mǎyǐ sēnlín) is a scheme launched on Alipay mobile client by Ant Financial Services Group in August 2016. Combining the Internet, finance and a low-carbon lifestyle, it is a personal carbon account as well as public benefit activity: if users walk, travel by public transport, pay utility fees online, pay traffic tickets online, make online hospital registration, book tickets online and generate other low-carbon activities, they would reduce corresponding carbon emissions. These would be counted and converted into virtual "green energy" and users could use these energy to raise a virtual tree in their Ant Forest account. When enough energy has been earned to grow a virtual tree, it would be converted into a real tree and planted in some real areas in China by people supported by Ant Financial Services Group and its partners. After that, the virtual tree in users' Ant Forest account have to be re-raise.
Until May 2017, there was about two hundred million users in Ant Forest, equivalent to 3% of the world's population. Until August 2017, 1.22 million tons carbon emissions have been reduced totally and 10.25 million entity trees have been planted. Users could see the trees they planted through satellite map. According to Gong Zhang, a former NASA scientist and the founder of GAGO Inc., it should be hard to see the saplings because of the low resolution of satellite, but millions of saplings have been planted so we could see the changes they brought to the world.Alipay hopes to cultivate and encourage users to stick to a low-carbon lifestyle through this way.
By August 27, 2019,122 million trees were planted in China by Alipay ant forest.
Background.
The world faces serious environmental challenges. As environmental pressures grow, global ecosystems are severely damaged. The Paris Agreement recognizes the collective nature of the historic challenge of reducing carbon emissions. As an important economic force in the world, China also faces great challenges. In the process of transitioning to a more low-carbon lifestyle, the use of digital technology in the financial sector plays a key role and some progress has been made, but green finance still has great potential for development. The development of new digital technologies and the innovation of forms attract more citizens to participate directly in green financing. In this case, in August 2016, Ant Financial launched the Ant Forest Program.
Application.
The purpose of ant forest activity is to convert simulated energy into real trees. Ant Financial evaluates the personal behavior data of participating users, including transportation, entertainment, and utility payments. For example, users can save carbon emissions from going out to buy train tickets by buying train tickets online. Convert "avoid carbon emissions" below the scheduled carbon emission standard into a user's virtual energy stored in a personal Ant Forest account, where virtual energy accumulates in a certain amount and can be exchanged online for different types of trees or protected areas, and then Ant Financial works with its ecological partners to plant a real tree in the desert.
Development.
On 5 September 2017, Ant Forest released a plan called "Planet Blue" at its "Bluer Sky" forum of the public benefit activities week. This plan would open product capabilities and technology platform to the whole society and urge everyone to participate in a green future. This project tries to transform itself into an incubator of social charity innovation. The CEO of Ant Financial Services Group Xiandong Jin said:" Public benefit activities are right around us. The power of mobile Internet technology is available to everyone and makes everyone's actions into possible. Technology is the greatest public welfare of this era". He also pointed out that mobile Internet allows individuals to translate their daily low-carbon behaviors into green energy, whilst the use of technologies such as remote sensing satellite and artificial intelligent technology could help commonweal organizations to manage forest ecology better and make public benefits more real and transparent. The new plan of Ant Forest would encourage more access to low-carbon scenarios and await the NPO, government agencies, international organizations and other partners to join into this public benefit innovation.
According to Wang Zu, the product manager of the Ant Financial Services Group, the plan was more than finding trees and preserves and union of brands, it was a vision of achieving the open of the whole industry chain, which could connect all the green scenes and resources with everyone's actions on the platform.
As of August 2019, more than 500 million people have joined the Alipay Ant Forest Green Program, planting more than 100 million trees and reducing carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons, covering a total area of 112,000 hectares in northwest China.
Cooperation.
On January 19, 2017, Ant Financial and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) launched the world's first green digital financial alliance during the Davos World Economic Forum, with the aim of harnessing digital technology to promoting financing that addresses global environmental challenges. The collaboration marked the UNEP's first joint venture with a Chinese company since it was established 45 years ago. The Sustainable Digital Finance Alliance (The Green Digital Finance Alliance) is registered as not-for-profit in Geneva and focuses on knowledge and policy recommendations and harnessing a global network of actors to undertake rapid and higher risk experimentation and challenges to address the potential for digital finance and fintech-powered business innovations to reshape the financial system in ways that better align it with the needs of sustainable development.
The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) released a report on China's carbon market on February 17 and specifically analyzed Ant Forest, the world's largest platform for gathering data on individuals' efforts to reduce their carbon footprints. The UNDP’s report said the Chinese platform has “a special significance in enhancing personal contribution to the global response to climate change”.
Reward.
Ali Annual Outstanding Public Benefit Activity Project.
19 September 2019, Ant Forest wins UN Champions of the Earth award, the United Nations’ top environmental honour in inspiration and action category.
Social implications.
Maosheng Duan (the director of the China Carbon Market Research Center Tsinghua University and the former chairman of the executive board of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)) said that Ant Forest have taken a pioneering step towards promoting ordinary people to reduce carbon emissions at consumer-sides. Ant Forest would make more contributions to the environment and public benefits in China and even the world. Also, it would become a typical duplicable project.
Zhenping Huang (the assistant to the president of the Institute For Philanthropy Tsinghua University) believed that in the era of technology, the public benefit activities could reshape personal habits as well as affect cooperations and interactions among social groups profoundly. Such crossover collision provides the most fertile soil to innovation of public benefits.
Carbon Trading.
Man-induced global climate change has become a prominent political issue. Dangerous climate change caused by rising greenhouse gas concentrations has a serious impact on global ecosystems, and governments are seeking mitigation measures and solutions. Market-based carbon trading is emerging as the most popular government strategy. Carbon trading refers to the economic action of trading carbon dioxide emissions rights as a commodity and in accordance with market mechanisms in order to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, and in the 1990s European governments began to limit corporate emissions by directly regulating and imposing carbon taxes. In 2005, the EU formed its own carbon trading system. Between 1997 and 2001, The Kyoto Protocol encourages governments to develop carbon trading plans. Carbon permits have rapidly grown into an important financial instrument on the market with billions of dollars a year.
China is the world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases and is regarded by many countries as the most promising market for emission reduction. The Kyoto Protocol limits countries' greenhouse gas emissions in the form of regulations. Ant Forest is the world's largest platform for personal carbon accounts, which record each person's low-carbon behavior in quantitative terms. According to Chenlong, Chief Strategy Officer of Ant Forests, if individual carbon reduction activities can form a nationally recognized methodology and incorporate China's voluntary emission reduction project (CCER), it will become a "carbon account" for individuals to participate in carbon trading in the future, participating in the future trading and investment in the carbon market. In addition, as of August 2019, Ant Forest users have reached 500 million, Ant Financial and the largest entrepreneurial environmental organization, SEE public welfare organization, the actual planting of more than 100 million trees in China's northwest region, a cumulative reduction of carbon emissions of 7.92 million tons, these reduced CO2 emissions will also be a huge asset in the carbon market. In the future, sustainable investment will be a means of generating long-term returns.

Transitron Electronic Corporation

Transitron Electronic Corporation was a semiconductor device fabrication company of the United States. It was founded by Leo and David Bakalar incorporated in Wakefield, Massachusetts, in 1952. David Bakalar was the president from 1952 to 1984. In 1986 the company went out of business, failing to keep pace with the rapid advances in technology.
History.
The company was established at the time of the economic boom in Massachusetts. Its first successful product was the gold bonded germanium diode, widely used in computers, military equipment, etc. After that the company manufactured silicon rectifiers (which David claims were the world first ones), grown junction silicon NPN transistors, silicon diodes, germanium diodes, silicon/germanium micro-diodes, silicon references, silicon regulators, silicon controlled rectifiers, bilateral switching diodes, etc.
At its heyday Transitron employed 1,600 people. In 1959 "Time Magazine" reported it was number 3 American semiconductor company, after Texas Instruments and General Electric, while "Fortune Magazine" placed it at number 2, with estimated 1959 sales of $40 million. A number senior industry persons, including Wilfred Corrigan, Dave Fullagar, Pierre Lamond, George Wells, and Thomas Longo used to work in Transitron.
In December 1959 the company went public, with IPO of 1,000,000 shares at $36 each. The first week closed at $43 per share. 
After going out of business, David Bakalar devoted his time to sculpture; see "Renaissance" (1989) and "TV Man or Five Piece Cube with Strange Hole" (1993).

Slider-crank linkage

A slider-crank linkage is a four-link mechanism with three revolute joints and one prismatic, or sliding, joint. The rotation of the crank drives the linear movement the slider, or the expansion of gases against a sliding piston in a cylinder can drive the rotation of the crank.
There are two types of slider-cranks: in-line and offset.
There are also two methods to design each type: graphical and analytical.
Kinematics of the in-line slider-crank.
The displacement of the end of the connecting rod is approximately proportional to the cosine of the angle of rotation of the crank, when it is measured from top dead center (TDC). So the reciprocating motion created by a steadily rotating crank and connecting rod is approximately simple harmonic motion:
where "x" is the distance of the end of the connecting rod from the crank axle, "l" is the length of the connecting rod, "r" is the length of the crank, and "α" is the angle of the crank measured from top dead center (TDC). Technically, the reciprocating motion of the connecting rod departs from sinusoidal motion due to the changing angle of the connecting rod during the cycle, the correct motion, given by the Piston motion equations is:
As long as the connecting rod is much longer than the crank formula_3 the difference is negligible. This difference becomes significant in high-speed engines, which may need balance shafts to reduce the vibration due to this "secondary imbalance".
The mechanical advantage of a crank, the ratio between the force on the connecting rod and the torque on the shaft, varies throughout the crank's cycle. The relationship between the two is approximately:
where formula_5 is the torque and "F" is the force on the connecting rod. But in reality, the torque is maximum at crank angle of less than "α" = 90° from TDC for a given force on the piston. One way to calculate this angle is to find out when the Connecting rod smallend (piston) speed becomes the fastest in downward direction given a steady crank rotational velocity. Piston speed x' is expressed as:
For example, for rod length 6" and crank radius 2", numerically solving the above equation finds the velocity minima (maximum downward speed) to be at crank angle of 73.17615° after TDC. Then, using the triangle sine law, it is found that the crank to connecting rod angle is 88.21738° and the connecting rod angle is 18.60647° from vertical (see Piston motion equations#Example).
When the crank is driven by the connecting rod, a problem arises when the crank is at top dead centre (0°) or bottom dead centre (180°). At these points in the crank's cycle, a force on the connecting rod causes no torque on the crank. Therefore, if the crank is stationary and happens to be at one of these two points, it cannot be started moving by the connecting rod. For this reason, in steam locomotives, whose wheels are driven by cranks, the connecting rods are attached to the wheels at points separated by some angle, so that regardless of the position of the wheels when the engine starts, at least one connecting rod will be able to exert torque to start the train.
Design.
An in-line crank slider is oriented in a way in which the pivot point of the crank is coincident with the axis of the linear movement. The follower arm, which is the link that connects the crank arm to the slider, connects to a pin in the center of sliding object. This pin is considered to be on the linear movement axis. Therefore, to be considered an "in-line" crank slider, the pivot point of the crank arm must be "in-line" with this pin point. The stroke() of an in-line crank slider is defined as the maximum linear distance the slider may travel between the two extreme points of its motion. With an in-line crank slider, the motion of the crank and follower links is symmetric about the sliding axis. This means that the crank angle required to execute a forward stroke is equivalent to the angle required to perform a reverse stroke. "For this reason, the in-line slider-crank mechanism produces balanced motion." This balanced motion implies other ideas as well. Assuming the crank arm is driven at a constant velocity, the time it takes to perform a forward stroke is equal to the time it takes to perform a reverse stroke.
Graphical approach.
The graphical method of designing an in-line slider-crank mechanism involves the usage of hand-drawn or computerized diagrams. These diagrams are drawn to scale in order for easy evaluation and successful design. Basic trigonometry, the practice of analyzing the relationship between triangle features in order to determine any unknown values, can be used with a graphical compass and protractor alongside these diagrams to determine the required stroke or link lengths.
When the stroke of a mechanism needs to be calculated, first identify the ground level for the specified slider-crank mechanism. This ground level is the axis on which both the crank arm pivot-point and the slider pin are positioned. Draw the crank arm pivot point anywhere on this ground level. Once the pin positions are correctly placed, set a graphical compass to the given link length of the crank arm. Positioning the compass point on the pivot point of the crank arm, rotate the compass to produce a circle with radius equal to the length of the crank arm. This newly drawn circle represents the potential motion of the crank arm. Next, draw two models of the mechanism. These models will be oriented in a way that displays both the extreme positions of the slider. Once both diagrams are drawn, the linear distance between the retracted slider and the extended slider can be easily measured to determine the slider-crank stroke.
The retracted position of the slider is determined by further graphical evaluation. Now that the crank path is found, draw the crank slider arm in the position that places it as far away as possible from the slider. Once drawn, the crank arm should be coincident with the ground level axis that was initially drawn. Next, from the free point on the crank arm, draw the follower link using its measured or given length. Draw this length coincident with the ground level axis but in the direction toward the slider. The unhinged end of the follower will now be at the fully retracted position of the slider. Next, the extended position of the slider needs to be determined. From the pivot point of the crank arm, draw a new crank arm coincident with the ground level axis but in a position closest to the slider. This position should put the new crank arm at an angle of 180 degrees away from the retracted crank arm. Then draw the follower link with its given length in the same manner as previously mentioned. The unhinged point of the new follower will now be at the fully extended position of the slider.
Both the retracted and extended positions of the slider should now be known. Using a measuring ruler, measure the distance between these two points. This distance will be the mechanism stroke, .
Analytical approach.
To analytically design an in-line slider crank and achieve the desired stroke, the appropriate lengths of the two links, the crank and follower, need to be determined. For this case, the crank arm will be referred to as "L2", and the follower link will be referred to as "L3". With all in-line slider-crank mechanisms, the stroke is twice the length of the crank arm. Therefore, given the stroke, the length of the crank arm can be determined. This relationship is represented as:
Once "L2" is found, the follower length ("L3") can be determined. However, because the stroke of the mechanism only depends on the crank arm length, the follower length is somewhat insignificant. As a general rule, the length of the follower link should be at least 3 times the length of the crank arm. This is to account for an often undesired increased acceleration yield, or output, of the connecting arm.
Offset slider-crank design.
The position of an offset slider-crank is derived by a similar formula to that for the inline form; using the same letters as in the previous diagram and an offset of formula_7:
Its speed (the first derivative of its position) is representable as:
Its acceleration (the second derivative of its position) is representable as the complicated equation of:
Analytical approach.
The analytical method for designing an offset crank slider mechanism is the process by which triangular geometry is evaluated in order to determine generalized relationships among certain lengths, distances, and angles. These generalized relationships are displayed in the form of 3 equations and can be used to determine unknown values for almost any offset slider-crank. These equations express the link lengths, "L1, L2, and L3", as a function of the stroke,"(ΔR4)max", the imbalance angle, "β", and the angle of an arbitrary line "M", "θM". Arbitrary line "M" is a designer-unique line that runs through the crank pivot point and the extreme retracted slider position. The 3 equations are as follows:
With these relationships, the 3 link lengths can be calculated and any related unknown values can be determined.
Slider-crank inversions.
Slider-crank chain inversion arises when the connecting rod, or coupler, of a slider-crank linkage becomes the ground link, so the slider is connected directly to the crank. This "inverted slider-crank" is the form of a slider-crank linkage that is often used to actuate a hinged joint in construction equipment like a crane or backhoe, as well as to open and close a swinging gate or door.
A slider-crank is a four-bar linkage that has a crank that rotates coupled to a slider that the moves along a straight line. 
This mechanism is composed of three important parts: The crank which is the rotating disc, the slider which slides inside the tube and the connecting rod which joins the parts together. As the slider moves to the right the connecting rod pushes the wheel round for the first 180 degrees of wheel rotation. When the slider begins to move back into the tube, the connecting rod pulls the wheel round to complete the rotation.
Different mechanism by fixing different link of slider crank chain are as follows :
This inversion is obtained when link 1 (ground body) is fixed. 
Application- Reciprocating engine, Reciprocating compressor etc...
This inversion is obtained when link 2 (crank) is fixed. 
Application- Whitworth quick return mechanism, Rotary engine, etc...
This inversion is obtained when link 3 (connecting rod) is fixed. 
Application- Slotted crank mechanism, Oscillatory engine etc..,
This inversion is obtained when link 4 (slider) is fixed.
Application- Hand pump, pendulum pump or Bull engine, etc.

Paquita Madriguera

 
Francisca "Paquita" Madriguera Rodon (15 September 1900 — 2 November 1965) was a Catalan pianist and composer, based for much of her adult life in Uruguay. 
Early life.
Francisca Madriguera was born in Igualada, Barcelona, the daughter of Enric Madriguera Haase and Francesca Rodon Canudas. Her younger brother was violinist and conductor Enric Madriguera. She was a child prodigy on piano, and studied with Enrique Granados as a girl. At age 11 she gave a concert in Madrid. At age 13 she played at the Royal Albert Hall in London.
Career.
Madriguera toured American cities in 1916 and 1917, billed as "The Mozart of Spain." A reviewer in 1916 found her "interesting though ridiculously spoiled", explaining that "she is extremely talented, possesses a powerful touch and well-developed technique, and will no doubt be one of the established artists of tomorrow." In 1917 she played at a benefit concert in New York, for the National League for Women's Service. During that same stay in the United States, she gave a joint concert with her brother in Chicago's Aeolian Theatre. She gave another recital at the Aeolian Hall in New York in 1919. Madriguera made piano roll recordings of her playing in the 1910s. 
Her promising career was suspended when she married in 1922 and lived in Uruguay. In widowhood in 1932, she moved back to Spain with her three young daughters, and resumed her musical career. She married again, to fellow musician Andres Segovia, and they returned to Uruguay to live in 1937.
Compositions by Madriguera included "Humorada" for guitar.
Personal life.
Paquita Madriguera married lawyer and editor Arturo Puig in 1922 in Montevideo, Uruguay. They had three daughters, Paquita (born 1923), Sofia (born 1925), and Maria Rosa (born 1927). She was widowed in 1931. She married Spanish guitarist Andres Segovia in 1935, and they had a daughter Beatriz (1938-1967). They divorced in 1948. She died in 1965, and was buried in Montevideo's Central Cemetery.
There is a street in Igualada, Carrer de Paquita Madriguera, named after her.

Jovellana

Jovellana is a genus of flowering plants in the family Calceolariaceae. It was formerly included in Scrophulariaceae, and is still listed by some authorities as belonging there. However, recent molecular research indicates that the family Scrophulariaceae was polyphyletic,
meaning that it contained more than one lineage with different parents. So several of its genera - including "Jovellana" - have been split off and assigned to new or existing families.
History.
During the Miocene epoch, the climate of the North Island of New Zealand was said to be subtropical. It started to cool down during the Late Miocene and Pliocene to a more temperate climate which was similar to that of central Chile. This may have allowed the South American elements of the "Jovellana" genus to establish their characteristics by long distance dispersal.
The South American and New Zealand clades are believed to have split 4.1 Ma and both New Zealand and South American species are believed to have diverged from one another about 1.0 Ma.
Description.
"Jovellana" currently contains six to eight species of mainly herbaceous perennials native to Chile and New Zealand. They have simple leaves and, in summer, nodding sprays of single, two-lipped, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, lilac and purple, heavily spotted with a contrasting colour inside.
The following species are currently included:
Distribution.
Authorities have commented on the disjunct nature of the two populations in Chile and New Zealand. However, this is not unique. "Fuchsia" is another genus with species apparently randomly segregated between Central and South America, New Zealand and Tahiti.
Cultivation.
At least three species are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. They are frost-hardy down to , but in cultivation they require a sheltered position in full sun. "Jovellana violacea", growing to tall by broad, is a semi-evergreen subshrub with lilac coloured flowers, internally spotted with purple on a yellow background. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.

Maria Bogner

Maria Bogner (née "Lux", 1914 – 17 November 2002) was a German fashion designer credited with developing practical stretch pants, thereby profoundly affecting the direction of the ski fashion industry. She created colorful, sexy, and functional stretchy skiwear. Her husband's established ski apparel company, the development of stretch material in the 1950s, and her sewing skills all contributed to her success. Her stretch pants, as modeled by leading ski athletes of the period, provided aerodynamic, form-fitting cut, color variety and practicality as ski garments.
Personal life.
Bogner was born Maria Lux in 1914 in Cologne, Germany and died on 17 November 2002 in Tegernsee, Germany. In 1937 she married Wilhelm Bogner (Willy Sr.), a German Nordic combined ski champion who competed in the 1930s. Together, they had three children, Rosemarie, Michael, and Wilhelm (Willy Jr.). Willy Bogner's success as a skier allowed him and his future wife, then Maria Lux, to establish a clothing line in 1932, that included outfitting the German national ski team at the 1936 Winter Olympics.
Her husband died in 1977 and she died in 2002.
Career.
Pre-WWII.
"Skiing Magazine" called Bogner, “the mother of modern ski fashion”, citing her outsized influence as a woman on ski culture. Her career began with the development of novel ski garments in the early 1930s and was interrupted by World War II.
In 1936 Bogner created an anorak (parka) for the German Olympic ski team of which her fiancé was a member. After their marriage, Bogner became involved in the fashion side of her husband's business, which included importing ski equipment. In addition to ski apparel, they designed and manufactured blouses, traditional Bavarian dresses, as well as hiking apparel. The growth of their business was interrupted by WWII and her husband's internment by the US.
Post-WWII.
After the war her ski fashion innovations in style and color, especially with stretch pants, allowed the Bogner business to flourish in the upscale ski apparel market.
While her husband was away and in order to support her three children, Bogner continued to design colorful anoraks that were sold by the thousands. In addition to creating and selling parkas, Bogner also began rebuilding the business by creating other products, such as aprons. In 1950, the Bogners began exporting their colorful products to the US, including Bogner's parkas. In 1955 Bogner began branding the company with a logo, styled as a “B”, on all zippers found on their clothing.
Early 1950s, stretch pants.
In the early 1950s, the Bogners were manufacturing ski pants in gabardine fabric. They were distinctive both for their durability and the wide choice of bright, appealing colors—a break from the previous standards of black, blue and forest green. In 1951, a Bianchini-Férier () textile representative introduced Bogner to a new material, with a crimp elasticized yarn, developed by the Swiss company, Heberlein (), and marketed under the name, "Helanca" ( ), which was incorporated into a prototype pair of ski pants. Helanca was a blend of wool and a springy, coiled nylon fiber, which allowed the material to stretch and be durable through multiple wash cycles. The problem was how to sew it successfully, which Bogner solved. Early examples of her stretch pants lost their resiliency after a few seasons. This problem was solved such that by 1955, she was exporting them to the US in 42 different colors. The pants were highly successful, despite costing double what conventional ski pants cost at the time, thanks to their aerodynamic, sexy, form-fitting cut and wide variety of colors. The product was marketed effectively in catalogs and advertisements, using attractive young women and celebrity athletes, such as Stein Eriksen, as models.
1960s to retirement.
The publicity and advertising of the Bogner line of up-scale fashion made it the choice of such celebrity consumers of ski apparel as, Marilyn Monroe, Ingrid Bergman, the Shah of Iran, and Toni Sailer. Bogner apparel was also in demand by ski teams for its aerodynamic efficiency and warmth. By the mid-1960s many other companies were producing stretch pants. Bogner remained active in the company until the early 1970s, when her sons, Michael and Willy Jr., took over the business.
Legacy.
Bogner's creation was so widely recognized that she was featured on the cover of the November 1955 issue of "Ski Magazine", wearing her ski apparel. In its 1995 "Skiing for Women" issue, "Skiing" magazine cited Bogner as a skiing "legend", along with Andrea Mead Lawrence and Martha Rockwell

Sam Daley-Harris

Sam Daley-Harris is an American activist and author. He is the founder of Results, and has been a hunger eradication advocate and democracy activist since the mid-1970s. Daley-Harris is also the author of "Reclaiming Our Democracy: Healing the Break Between People and Government".
Early career.
Early in his life, Sam Daley-Harris was a music teacher, and was a percussionist for the Miami Philharmonic.
Activism.
During the 1970s Daley-Harris became involved in the movement to eradicate global hunger. During this process he spoke with about seven thousand high-school students, at which time he discovered that only 3% of the youth knew the name of their congressperson. In response, he founded an organization called Results (stylized: RESULTS), which is an acronym for "Responsibility for Ending Starvation Using Legislation, Trimtabbing, and Support". After working with other anti-hunger organizations like Bread for the World, he founded the organization in 1980, which recruited and trained volunteers to lobby the government on food security and hunger issues. Tactics have included sit-down meetings with politicians, generating supportive media, and letter writing campaigns.
The organization has also helped advocate for global vaccination campaigns with UNICEF, and worked in promoting micro-lending. Muhammad Yunus said of Results' work in micro-lending that, “No other organization has been as critical a partner in seeing to it that micro-credit is used as a tool to eradicate poverty and empower women.” Daley-Harris has also served as the director of the Microcredit Summit Campaign, where he advocated for the role of microcredit in combating poverty. The Microcredit Summit Campaign tracked the “performance” of microfinance organizations.
He later founded the organization Center for Citizen Empowerment and Transformation, which provides consultations to organizations on the subject of “deep advocacy”, a method of working with politicians and the media to fuel advocacy efforts for social issues. The organization later changed its name to Civic Courage. He has also worked with Citizens' Climate Lobby.
Writing.
Sam Daley-Harris is the author of the book "Reclaiming Our Democracy: Healing the Break Between People and Government", which at the end of the book outlines thirteen “principles of action”, and uses case-studies of successful advocacy to show evidence of their efficacy. Many of the case-studies come from Daley-Harris’ work as the head of Results. The original version was published in 1993, and a twentieth anniversary edition was published in 2013 with a foreword by Muhammad Yunus. He is also the co-editor of the book "New Pathways Out of Poverty".

Brenda Lopez Romero

Brenda Lopez Romero is an American politician and is the first Latina to have ever been elected to the Georgia General Assembly. She is a member of the Georgia House of Representatives from the 99th District, serving since 2017. State Rep. Lopez Romero currently serves on the State House Education, Retirement, and State Planning and Community Affairs committees. Lopez Romero has sponsored 72 bills. She is a member of the Democratic party. After weeks of lobbying by the Latino Victory Fund, Georgia Assembly House Minority Leader Bob Trammell and other public figures in the state, Lopez Romero launched her campaign for Georgia's 7th Congressional District on May 1, 2019.
Early life, Education, and Career.
Lopez Romero was born in the Mexican city of Cuernavaca and came to the United States at the age of five. In 2008, after years of waiting on a backlog, Lopez Romero became a U.S. Citizen. She graduated from Cross Keys High School in DeKalb County. After becoming the first in her family to graduate high school, Lopez Romero earned a bachelor's degree in political science and sociology from Georgia State University in 2005. She then went on to receive her Juris Doctor, with a concentration in National Security and Counterterrorism, from Syracuse University College of Law. Before graduating law school in 2011, Lopez Romero served as a law clerk for the Farmworker's Division of the Georgia Legal Services Program; she then clerked for the ACLU of Georgia's National Security and Immigrant Rights Project.
In 2011, after being admitted to the State Bar of Georgia, Lopez Romero managed the immigration department for the Velasquez Law Firm, LLC. In 2012, through her role as a staff attorney for Catholic Charities' Immigration Legal Services, Lopez Romero represented numerous low-income immigrants and families in times of crisis. In 2013, she opened her own law firm in Norcross, Georgia primarily dealing with immigration matters.
Georgia House of Representatives.
2016 and 2018 Campaigns.
In 2016, Lopez Romero ran to represent Georgia's 99th State House District in the General Assembly. After beating Jay Trevari in the Democratic Primary, Lopez Romero won 100% of the vote in the general election and became the first Latina elected to the state's legislature. In 2018, Lopez Romero ran for re-election to the State House; she handily beat her primary opponent, Shawn Allen, winning 77% of the vote. She again ran unopposed in the general election and was subsequently re-elected with 100% of the vote.
Legislative Tenure.
Since first being sworn in 2017, Lopez Romero has served on the Education, Retirement, and State Planning and community Affairs committees. She has sponsored, or co-authored, 72 bills since taking office.
HB 481.
Lopez Romero was opposed to and voted against 2019's HB 481, which sought to ban abortions once a fetal heartbeat was detected. She, along with several other lawmakers, brought coathangers onto the House floor to show her opposition to the controversial bill.
HB 896.
In 2020, Lopez Romero, along with several other legislators, introduced HB 896; the bill seeks to allow high school graduates in Georgia to receive in-state tuition regardless of their immigration status. If passed, Georgia would be the 20th state to enact such a law.
2020 Congressional Campaign.
On May 1, 2019, Lopez Romero announced that she would not seek re-election to the State House and would instead be vying to finally flip Georgia's 7th Congressional District. Upon announcing she said, "We have a unique opportunity to elect someone who reflects the values and the rich diversity of our district...I know that I am the right person for the job.” Soon after announcing, she was endorsed by Georgia Assembly Minority Leader Bob Trammell, Chair of the Gwinnett House Delegation Rep. Pedro Marin, Atlanta Public Schools Board of Education Board Chair Jason Esteves, Georgia Assembly House Democratic Chair James Beverly, and several other major figures in the state.
After the June 9, 2020 election, numerous media outlets had initially declared that the primary would be going to a runoff between Lopez Romero and Carolyn Bourdeaux; however, after tens of thousands of absentee ballots were counted, Bourdeaux was declared to have won the primary outright.
In her concession statement, Brenda Lopez Romero stated, "I am about to walk into legislative session and just walked out of our streets as I protested and stated that #BlackLivesMatter, this impresses upon me how vital our work is and that there is still a great deal to do for our state and country. As I finish up my last term in the state legislature (for now), I will continue to fight for the hate crimes bill and justice-for-all legislation, push back against cuts to our education budget, and reform our state’s election laws so every citizen can exercise their sacred right to vote with ease and security. Furthermore, I will concentrate on supporting efforts to flip the 16 state house seats we need in order to prevent disastrous gerrymandering in 2021...No one is voiceless. Rather, there are those whose voices are always heard and those whose voices continue to be ignored. It is my goal to magnify the voices and perspectives of those who are ignored."
After 2020 Campaign.
Brenda Lopez Romero currently leads the Gwinnett County Democratic Party as its Chair. Additionally, she is Senior Assistant District Attorney for the Gwinnett Judicial Circuit handling special projects.
Honors and Awards.
The Georgia Association of Educators' gave Lopez Romero the 2017 Friend of Education Award. In 2019, she was recognized as one of the 50 Most Influential Latinos in Georgia.

My Hustler

My Hustler is a 1965 American film by Andy Warhol. The film is propelled by the sonorous, magnetic acting of 30 year old Ed Hood interacting with the blonde Hustler, Paul America. 
Joe Campbell ("Sugar Plum Fairy"), Genevieve Charbin and Dorothy Dean also compete for the attentions of the Hustler and provide foils for the interaction of the main characters. The erudite and very funny Hood, a perpetual graduate student in English at Harvard and "live parody of southern gentility", was recruited by Chuck Wein. Hood's magnetic performance was driven by his deep, mellifluous voice, trained by elocution lessons as a privileged child in Alabama, and lubricated copiously by alcohol. Among his many peculiarities was his habit of drinking beer from the bottle, not by placing the bottle to his lips, but into his mouth, sucking on it, as seen in the film.
Production.
The film is a collaboration between Warhol, Chuck Wein and Paul Morrissey, with Morrissey as camera and audio operator and Wein credited as director, and was filmed over Labor Day Weekend, 1965, on Fire Island, NY using a 16mm Auricon news camera. My Hustler is the first Warhol film worked on by Paul Morrissey, who introduced, in this fim, camera movement and audible sound to Warhol's cinematography. 
Release.
Distribution.
The first advertisement for a screening of "My Hustler" appeared in the 6 January 1966 issue of the Village Voice for screenings on the 12th, 13th and 14th of January at 8 and 10 pm at the Filmmakers' Cinematheque and was mentioned in The New York Times on January 30. On January 20th a "special notice" in The Village Voice informed the reader that the film would play "every midnight indefinitely" due to public demand. It ended its first run at the Filmmakers' Cinematheque in the middle of April, 1966. Opening at the more mainstream Hudson Theater in July 1967, the film was shown near-continuously in New York City through the end of 1968. The film first showed in Los Angeles and Chicago in early July, 1966 and then ran near-continuously in L. A. and Chicago through 1969. The film was also shown in Tucson, San Bernardino, Albuquerque, Akron and Indianapolis in 1966-67.
Revivals.
My Hustler was revived in New York City numerous times after 1969, although, since Warhol withdrew his films from distribution between 1970 and 1984, the provenance of some of these showings is unclear. After 1984, with Warhol's approval, the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum "agreed to collaborate on the largest archival research project in the history of American avant-garde cinema: to catalogue Warhol’s massive film collection, investigate its history, and preserve and re-release all of the films in conjunction with a program of scholarly research and publication." Since 1988, My Hustler has been screened several times at both museums, but, like other Warhol films, has never been commercially released on DVD or other medium. 
Reception.
Box office.
My Hustler was the first Warhol film to make any money, grossing $4,000 from its initial run at the Filmmaker's Cinematheque. At the Hudson theater in New York, it grossed $52,400 in its first 3 weeks.
Critical reception.
A common expression at the time of the films initial release was one of revulsion; viz. Bosley Crowther:
"It is sordid, vicious and contemptuous. The only thing engaging about it is a certain quality and tone of degradation that is almost too candid and ruthless to be believed."
A few years later the revolutionary nature of My Hustler was being recognized; Vincent Canby, in somewhat backwards and grudging praise, complained that distributors were taking his critical remarks out of context and using them as advertising come-ons:
"Warhol, of course, is responsible for one of the toughest dilemmas facing critics today. Largely as a result of his pioneering in the making of movies like Chelsea Girls and My Hustler it's impossible to accurately describe many new movies without automatically writing phrases that can't be picked up and used as instant come-ons,"
By 1995 the critical perspective of Warhol's most influential films, including My Hustler had shifted to an appreciation of their unique, semi-documentary perspective; Stephen Holden:
"The esthetic running through Warhol's films is an icy voyeurism. As witty or sexy or photogenic as Warhol's superstars may have been, their largely unstructured, crudely edited play-acting in front of his camera could also be cruelly revealing. Again and again one has the feeling of confronting people with limited internal resources, desperate to be noticed at any cost."
Censorship.
My Hustler was the subject of plainclothes police surveillance in the audience during its initial theatrical release in 1966, and on April 12 the owners of the Filmmakers' Cinematheque were served a summons to a hearing to show-cause why the theater's license should not be revoked for showing films of "sexual immorality, lewdness, perversion and homosexuality." On November 16, after a defense by the New York Civil Liberties Union, the charges were thrown out.

Gillery Pigott

Sir Gillery Pigott (1813 – 27 April 1875) was a British Liberal Party politician and judge.
Early life and family.
Born in Oxford in 1813, Pigott was the fourth son of Paynton Pigott (later Stainsby-Conant) and Lucy, third daughter of Richard Drope Gough. He was educated in Putney at the school of Reverend William Carmalt. In 1836, he married Frances, daughter of Thomas Drake, and they had eight children: two sons and six daughters.
Legal career.
Pigott launched his legal career in 1836 when he entered the Middle Temple, and three years later he was called to the bar and entered the Oxford circuit. There, he worked with H Rodwell to serialise reports of appeals from revising barristers between 1844 and 1846.
In 1854, he was made counsel to the Inland Revenue and in 1856, he became serjeant, receiving a patent of precedence the following year. From December 1857 to December 1862, he was recorder of Hereford.
Pigott was made a Baron of the Court of the Exchequer on 3 October 1863, and was knighted on 1 November. The appointment was initially received with disfavour by the bar, but he became well-liked and recognised for strict impartiality and conscientiousness in his arbitration.
Political career.
Pigott first launched his bid for a seat in the House of Commons in 1859, when he stood for Banbury; he retired before polling day. The next year, he was elected MP for Reading at a by-election – caused by his elder brother Francis Pigott Stainsby Conant being appointed Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man — but resigned just under three years later when he became the last baron appointed a judge of the Court of the Exchequer. During his brief period in parliament, he made a notable effort to introduce a law correcting anomalies in Jersey law.
Death.
Pigott died at his home, Sherfield Hill House, near Basingstoke, Hampshire on 27 April 1875 from a heart attack precipitated by a fall from his horse. He was buried at the parish church at Sherfield upon Lodden the next day. His son, Arthur Gough Pigott, banned the Anglican burial service being read over the coffin, leading to a £1 fine with costs.

Hans C. Jensen House

The Hans C. Jensen House, at 263 E. 100 South in Ephraim, Utah, is a historic pair-house built around 1870. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
It was deemed "significant as an example of Scandinavian vernacular architecture in Utah." It is a one-and-a-half-story limestone pair-house, of the subtype having a two-room deep plan. It has paired internal stove chimneys. A bungalow-style portico is a later addition.
It was home of Hans C. Jensen, born in 1845 in Housenge, Denmark. He joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the 1860s and immigrated to Utah in 1866, settling in Ephraim. He was a farmer who also "served on the city council, and was active in the local Danish ward meeting."
The house is south-facing. By 2009, the western one of the pair of roof-piercing chimneys was no longer present.

Burnaby Art Gallery

The Burnaby Art Gallery (abbreviated as BAG) is an art museum in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. The museum is located on the northern periphery of Deer Lake Park, situated off of Deer Lake Avenue. The museum occupies Fairacres Mansion, a historic residence designated as a historic site by the provincial government.
The institution was established through a private association in 1967, who used the publicly owned Fairacres Mansion to exhibit its collection. The association continued to manage the museum until 1998, when the municipal government of Burnaby assumed control of the museum's collections, and governance.
The museum's permanent collection holds more that 6,000 artworks. It is the only public art collection in Canada dedicated to works on paper.
Scope of operation.
Established in 1967, the Burnaby Art Gallery has been dedicated to collecting, preserving and presenting a contemporary and historical visual art program by local, national and internationally recognized artists. The Burnaby Art Gallery cares for and manages over 6,000 works of art in the City of Burnaby's Permanent Art Collection. Located at 6344 Deer Lake Avenue, the Burnaby Art Gallery is operated by the City of Burnaby.
Building history.
The Burnaby Art Gallery is located in Fairacres Mansion, which was designed by Robert Percival Sterling Twizell (1875-1964). Fairacres Mansion, also called Ceperley House, for its original owners, was built in 1910 at an estimated cost of C$150,000.00, making it the largest and most expensive house in Burnaby, BC of its time. It was constructed in the Edwardian Arts and Crafts style with handmade fixtures, carpentry and tiled fireplaces. The grounds included horse stables, an aviary, gazebo and pergola, lagoons, strawberry fields, greenhouses, a steam plant and a gardener's cottage. The tiles throughout the house were imported from England, fabricated by Conrad Dressler and his Medmenham Pottery. In the former billiards room and parlour, a grand oak mantelpiece, hand-carved by George Selkirk Gibson, bears a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson: "The ornament of a house is the friends who frequent it." On the death of the original owner, Grace Ceperley, the house was sold to a series of private owners. In 1939, it was acquired by Benedictine monks, and became an Abbey in 1953. The Order vacated the house in 1954 when it moved to Westminster Abbey (British Columbia) in Mission. After the Benedictines sold the property, it was used by the Canadian Temple of More Abundant Life and as a fraternity house for Simon Fraser University's Delta Upsilon Fraternity. In 1966, the Burnaby Art Society, led by Jack Hardman, Sheila Kincaid and Winifred Denny, among others, worked with the City of Burnaby to purchase the site for C$166,000.00. The Burnaby Art Gallery opened its doors in June 1967.
Permanent collection.
The Burnaby Art Gallery manages a collection of over 6,000 works on paper, primarily created by Canadian artists. Highlights include substantial holdings by Ernest Lumsden, Jack Shadbolt, Takao Tanabe, Susan Point, BC Binning, Roy Henry Vickers, Laurence Hyde, Gathie Falk, Sylvia Tait, Ann Kipling, and Alistair Bell.
Select exhibitions since 1967
The Burnaby Art Gallery has organized and hosted a number of temporary, and travelling exhibitions. A select list of exhibitions held at the museum since 1967 include:

High Flying Bird (song)

"High Flying Bird" (sometimes "High Flyin' Bird") is a song written by American folk and country singer-songwriter Billy Edd Wheeler, and first recorded by Judy Henske in 1963. It was performed and recorded by many musicians and groups in the mid and late 1960s, and was influential on the folk rock genre.
Recordings and notable performances.
The song's first published recording was by Judy Henske, as the B-side of her late 1963 Elektra single "Charlotte Town", and then as the title track of her second album in 1964. Critic Richie Unterberger described the song as having "an arresting minor-key melody and brooding lyrics contrasting the freedom of a bird to the singer's earthbound misery." Henske's powerful vocal was supported by acoustic guitarist John Forsha, electric guitarist Jack Marshall, Bill Montgomery on bass, and drummer Earl Palmer. Forsha reported that Henske learned the song from Wheeler, although Wheeler did not release his own version until 1967, on his album "Paper Birds". Forsha said of Henske's version: "the song could be called folk-rock although that wasn't our intent. We took a country-folk song, head-arranged it, and gave it to a jazz combo." Unterberger describes Henske's recording as "incredibly influential".
The song was recorded by several other influential musicians and bands in the mid and late 1960s, some of whom amended the lyrics to place greater emphasis on the freedom of the flying bird. Recordings included those by the Au Go Go Singers featuring then-19-year-old Stephen Stills, on the 1964 album "They Call Us Au Go-Go Singers"; Carolyn Hester on her 1965 album "At Town Hall, One"; The New Christy Minstrels on their 1966 album "New Kick!"; and Richie Havens on his 1967 album "Mixed Bag". Havens performed the song at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. The song was also recorded by We Five with the only vocal by their lead singer Beverly Bivens on their 1967 album "Make Someone Happy".
Psychedelic band Jefferson Airplane recorded the track at one of their first recording sessions in December 1965; it was eventually released in 1974 as part of the "Early Flight" album. The band also played the song at the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967, and their performance was included in the film "Monterey Pop". Other notable versions of the song were recorded by rock band H. P. Lovecraft on their 1968 album "H. P. Lovecraft II"; by Boston-based psychedelic rock outfit Ill Wind on their only album "Flashes" in 1968; by guitarist Isaac Guillory on his 1988 album "Live"; and by Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse on their 2012 album "Americana".
Influence.
The title of the song influenced the name of Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds. Gallagher was listening to the song, which appeared on Jefferson Airplane's "Early Flight", when he decided to "borrow" the title.

A-232

A-232 is an organophosphate nerve agent. It was developed in the Soviet Union under the FOLIANT program and is one of the group of compounds referred to as Novichok agents that were revealed by Vil Mirzayanov. A-232 is reportedly slightly less potent as a nerve agent compared to some of the other compounds in the series such as A-230 and A-234, having similar potency to the older nerve agent VR. However it proved to be the most versatile agent as it was chemically stable and remained a volatile liquid over a wide temperature range, making it able to be used in standard chemical munitions without requiring special delivery mechanisms to be developed.
Legal status.
A-232 has been added to Schedule 1 of the Annex on Chemicals of the Chemical Weapons Convention as of June 2020, and it has been explicitly named as an example compound for schedule 1.A.14. For chemicals listed in Schedule 1, the most stringent declaration and verification measures are in place combined with far-reaching limits and bans on production and use.

<doc id="56859039" url="?curid=56859039" title="The Au Go Go Singers">
The Au Go Go Singers

The Au Go Go Singers were a nine-member folk group formed in New York City in 1964, and best remembered for featuring Stephen Stills and Richie Furay two years before they formed Buffalo Springfield.
Career.
Stills and Furay met while performing in folk clubs in Greenwich Village, alongside Furay’s former college classmates Bob Harmelink and Nels Gustafson. They were seen by songwriter Ed E. Miller, the credited co-writer of the Serendipity Singers' hit "Don't Let the Rain Come Down". In early 1964, Miller was preparing a revue, "America Sings", which chronicled the history of folk music in America, and suggested that the four, together with an existing group, the Bay Singers – Roy Michaels, Mike Scott, Fred Geiger and Jean Gurney – and Kathy King (Kathrin King Segal), provide the music in the show. Although the show only ran for two weeks, Miller secured a contract with Roulette Records for the nine-strong group to record an album, which they did with producers Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore. After seeing the show, club owner Howard Solomon signed the group for a residency at his Cafe au Go Go nightclub on Bleecker Street.
By the time the LP was released in late 1964, the ensemble had become known as the Au Go Go Singers. As well as appearing at the club, they also made TV appearances, and performed at other venues. Their album, "They Call Us Au Go-Go Singers", featured Stills' lead vocals on Billy Edd Wheeler's song "High Flying Bird", and Furay singing Tom Paxton's "Where I'm Bound". The album overall is described at Allmusic as "predictably bland, professional and well executed group hootenanny folk music". The album also included songs by Jesse Fuller, John Stewart, and Lee Hays. A single, "San Francisco Bay Blues"/ "Pink Polemoniums", was released from the album. 
Following a dispute with Solomon, the group's management was taken over by Jim Friedman and they continued to perform, but found that their contract with Morris Levy at Roulette meant that some venues were unwilling to book them, and they also found that, after the British Invasion, their style of music was rapidly becoming unfashionable. A second album never appeared; some members received draft notices; and Kathy King, who suffered from stage fright, decided to leave. In 1965, the group disbanded. Stills then joined the four members of the Bay Singers – Michaels, Scott, Geiger, and Gurney – and, renamed The Company, toured in Ontario. During the tour, Stills met Neil Young, when the Company were on the same bill as Young's band, the Squires. The following year, Stills, Young and Furay formed Buffalo Springfield in Los Angeles.
Of the other members of the Au Go Go Singers, Roy Michaels later formed Cat Mother &amp; the All Night Newsboys, whose first album was produced by Jimi Hendrix. Kathy King worked as a backing singer with Bobby Vinton before working in the Broadway show "Oh! Calcutta!" and other theatre and cabaret shows under the name Kathrin King Segal.
The album "They Call Us Au Go-Go Singers" was issued on CD by Rhino Records in 1999.

Possession Island (Namibia)

Possession Island is the largest of the Penguin Islands, a scattered group of islands to the south of Namibia. It is the largest among the country's coastal islands, with an area of , and is located away from the Diamond Coast and to the south of Lüderitz, on the Lüderitz Bay.
It features arid and rocky ground, with occasional shrubbery and low vegetation where some species of bird nest, the African penguin among them. In the 1950s, the island had the largest population of African penguins in Namibia, with around 46,000 adults; however by 2001, only 2,000 remained.
For several years, the island was a guano collecting spot, and therefore had a small population consisting of some people in charge of collecting the product.
The island was also known, in the 18th century, as Thompson's Island.

A-234 (nerve agent)

A-234 is an organophosphate nerve agent. It was developed in the Soviet Union under the FOLIANT program and is one of the group of compounds referred to as Novichok agents that were revealed by Vil Mirzayanov. In March 2018 the Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, claimed to have been informed by British authorities that A-234 had been identified as the agent used in the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Vladimir Uglev, one of the inventors of the Novichok series of compounds, said he was "99 percent sure that it was A-234" in relation to the 2018 Amesbury poisonings, noting its unusually high persistence in the environment.
According to a classified report by the United States Army National Ground Intelligence Center, the agent designated as A-232 and its ethyl analog A-234, developed under the FOLIANT program, "are as toxic as VX, as resistant to treatment as soman, and more difficult to detect and easier to manufacture than VX". Of the agent's binary versions, one is reportedly formed by acetonitrile and an organic phosphate "that can be disguised as a pesticide precursor," while for another, Bill Gertz wrote, "soldiers need only add alcohol".
No certain data on toxicity exist but it is estimated that the median lethal concentration of A-234 is 7 mg/m3. This means that half of 70 kg men under slight physical activitybreathing 15 litres of air per minutewould die within two minutes of exposure. This equates to median lethal dose of 0.2 mg via respiration.
Regulated chemical under the Chemical Weapons Convention.
A-234 has recently (entry into force 7 June 2020) been added to Schedule 1 of the Annex on Chemicals of the Chemical Weapons Convention and it has been explicitly named as an example compound for schedule 1.A.14. For chemicals listed in Schedule 1, the most stringent declaration and verification measures are in place combined with far-reaching limits and bans on production and use.
Alternative structure.
An alternative structure for A-234 and the related Novichok agents had previously been proposed by Western chemical weapons experts such as Steven Hoenig and D. Hank Ellison. These structures were supported by Soviet literature of the time and were tested as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, however Mirzayanov explained that a number of weaker agents developed as part of the Foliant program were published in the open literature as organophosphate pesticides, in order to disguise the secret nerve agent program as legitimate pesticide research.

Jo Eleanor Elliott

Jo Eleanor Elliott (5 October 1923 – 1 May 2011) was a nurse based in the United States. She received the Living Legend Award from the American Nurses Association and was the head of the American Nurses Association. She was also led the Department of Health and Human Service's Division of Nursing, effectively as the nation's top nurse.
Life.
Elliott was born in La Monte, Missouri in 1923 to parents E. Stanton and Kathryn Knight Elliott. She had four siblings. She was an active member of her local Christian church, the Community United Church of Christ. She died in May 2011 in a Boulder, Colorado hospital at age 87.
Education.
Elliott attended high school in Warrensburg, Missouri and graduated as the valedictorian of her high school in 1941. She then attended Central Missouri State College, small, two-year teacher's college located in Missouri; from 1941 until 1943. In 1947, Elliott earned her bachelor's degree in nursing from the University of Michigan after transferring there from Central Missouri State College. While a student at the University of Michigan, she was a member of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps from 1944 until 1947. In 1953, she received a master's degree in nursing education from the University of Chicago. Her master's thesis was entitled "A History of the University of Michigan School of Nursing," and was completed in 1953.
Career.
Elliott joined the University of Michigan faculty and taught at the University of Michigan from 1947 until 1952. She was an instructor in Nursing (Nursing Arts) from 1947 to 1948, and thereafter an instructor in Nursing (Surgical) from 1948 to 1952. She left the University of Michigan to pursue a master's degree in nursing education. After graduating, she became a faculty member at the University of California, Los Angeles.
She was the head of the Western Council on Higher Education for Nursing from 1957 to 1980. This council was a collection of over 150 schools of nursing across 13 states. She advocated for continuing education, graduate education, and basic education for nurses; and helped to cultivate loans and scholarships for nurses. Her work with the Western Council on Higher Education for Nursing was perhaps the first work done in evaluation of continuing education in the United States. The council launched a 12-year initiative for continuing education for nurses. Over 3,000 nurses completed continuing education programs through the council. Elliott also participated in numerous research projects and conferences about higher education for nurses. She developed many of her plans in collaboration with Lulu Wolf Hassenplug, who worked then at the University of California, Los Angeles and Pearl Coulter, who worked at the University of Arizona. Elliott considered Hassenplug to be her mentor in her endeavors for advocating for continuing education.
Elliott served as the president of the American Nursing Association from 1964 until 1968. She helped to advocate support for Medicare in the United States. In 1964, she helped to pass the Nurse Training Act to Aid Professional Nursing Education. In 1965, Elliott along with the American Nursing Association controversially advocated for nurses to have at least a baccalaureate degree in nursing, and an associate degree for technical nursing. Elliott argued that this was essential for the field of nursing to evolve with the needs of patients, and scientific knowledge, in mind. Also in 1965, she was present when the Medicare bill was signed into law. She also helped to set minimum salaries for nurses, devised a revised Code for Nurses, helped to overhaul the structure of the American Nursing Association, established practice divisions in the American Nursing Association, and created the Congress on Nursing Practice. She was re-elected head of the American Nursing Association on June 17, 1966.
Elliott was the United States' Department of Health And Human Services's director of the Division of Nursing from 1980 - 1989. Elliott headed the International Council of Nurses from 1965 until 1969. Elliott was a member of Sigma Theta Tau. She taught at several universities, including the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Texas, San Antonio, Loyola University Chicago, and The University of Michigan.
Honors.
In 1966, Elliott was named a Woman of Achievement in the first annual Colorado Woman of Achievement ceremony. She was one of three selected out of a pool of 102 women throughout Colorado that were nominated. In 1974, Elliott received an honor for Distinguished Leadership in Continuing Education in Nursing at the Sixth National Conference on Continuing Education in Nursing. She was nominated for this award by her peers in the field. In 1987, she received a Distinguished Alumni Athena Award from the University of Michigan. In 1997, the American Academy of Nursing named Elliott a Living Legend, which is the organization's highest award. The University of Michigan established the Jo Eleanor Elliott Scholarship Fund in their school of nursing. In 1988, the Western Institute of Nursing established the Jo Eleanor Elliott Leadership Award, which has been awarded continuously every year since. In 2010, then-President Barack Obama praised her for her lifelong contributions to, and advocacy for, healthcare. In 2010, the National League for Nursing gave her the "President's Award: Champion in the Shaping of Nursing Education." Elliott was the recipient of six honorary doctorates. She also received the American Nursing Association's Distinguished Membership Award.

Peplos, Evros

Peplos (Greek: Πέπλος) is a town and a community of Feres municipal unit, Evros regional unit, East Macedonia and Thrace, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is a part of the municipality Alexandroupoli. The town's population is around 1,500 people.
History.
The Evros region where Peplos is located is in the historical region of Thrace. It was ruled by various major empires throughout history, including the Roman Empire and then the Byzantine Empire. Along with the rest of the Greek mainland it was conquered by the Ottomans in the 14th and 15th centuries. It remained under Ottoman rule until the Balkan Wars, when it was conquered by Bulgaria in 1913. Following World War I it was ceded to Greece in the Treaty of Neuilly in 1920.
Balkan Wars.
Before the First Balkan War Peplos (then known as Merhamli) was in the Ottoman Adrianople Vilayet. In 1912 the Balkan League including Bulgaria and Greece went to war with the Ottomans, and Bulgaria invaded Ottoman Western Thrace. A battle between Bulgarian and Ottoman forces occurred at Peplos in November 1912, known as the Battle of Merhamli. This battle was a decisive victory for the Bulgarians, who would go on to win the war along with the rest of the Balkan League. The next year Bulgaria went to war against the rest of the Balkan League (and Romania and the Ottomans) in the Second Balkan War. Following the two Balkan Wars Peplos was in Bulgarian hands until the First World War.
Transport.
Peplos is linked with the GR-2 or the Egnatia Odos (Alexandroupoli - Kavala - Thessaloniki - Kozani - Igoumenitsa) and the GR-51 (Alexandroupoli - Orestiada - Ormenio)
The town is served by Peplos railway station, on the Alexandroupoli–Svilengrad Line with services to Alexandroupoli.

Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections

Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections (also abbreviated as Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections, Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent Elections or simply Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions) is a report which was issued by the United States Office of the Director of National Intelligence that made an assessment of the extent and basis of Russia's interference in United States' elections in 2016. Published on January 6, 2017, the report includes an appraisal by the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the type and breadth of actions undertaken by Russia and affiliated elements during the elections. The report examines Russia's utilization of cyberspace such as hacking and the use of internet trolls and bots, and an intensive media campaign to influence public opinion in the United States. Additionally, it analyzes Russia's intentions and motivations in regards to their influence campaign. Issued in two forms, a classified version and a declassified version, the report drew its conclusions based on highly classified intelligence, an understanding of past Russian actions, and sensitive sources and methods.
Background.
Between 2015 and 2016, computer hackers affiliated with Russian intelligence breached the Democratic National Committee and began scoping its servers and lifting large amounts of data in the form of e-mails, donor lists, opposition research, etc. This information was published during the summer of 2016 by DCLeaks and WikiLeaks. In March 2016, John Podesta, the chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, was the target of a spear-phishing attack which stole more than 20,000 pages of e-mails that were subsequently dumped by WikiLeaks later in the fall of 2016.
On October 7, 2016, roughly one month before Election Day, the Department of Homeland Security in conjunction with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the independent agency charged with overseeing and integrating the U.S. Intelligence Community, released a statement expressing confidence that the Russian government was attempting to influence the upcoming election. The statement accused Russia of hacking and disseminating e-mails, and probing election databases, reading "We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities." Two months after the election, on December 9, outgoing President Barack Obama directed intelligence agencies to conduct a "full review" of Russian influence operations on the U.S. electoral process back to 2008. A preliminary Joint Analysis Report (JAR) was released by the DHS and FBI on December 29, which provided specific details on the type of cyber-tools and infrastructure utilized by Russian intelligence services in compromising and exploiting American systems.
Contents.
The version of "Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections" released for public consumption contained the same conclusions as the classified version, however, complete supporting information for the claims made in the public report was omitted due to its classified nature. The intelligence used was compiled by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the National Security Agency (NSA), and throughout the report confidence-levels by the agencies relating to specific claims were measured.
In the report, it is explicitly made known that the U.S. Intelligence Community only analyzed and monitored the intentions, capabilities, and actions of the Russian government, and not what, if any, impact their influence campaign had on U.S. public opinion or the U.S. political process. Much of the content was focused on RT, the Kremlin-funded television network, and its purported role in attempting to manipulate U.S. public opinion and discourse. The report was the most detailed public collection of Russian efforts to meddle in the 2016 elections released as of January 2017.
According to CNN, the CIA and FBI took Steele's dossier "seriously enough that they kept it out of" the January 6, 2017, assessment "in order to not divulge which parts of the dossier they had corroborated and how."&lt;ref name="Perez_Prokupecz_Brown_10/25/2017"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Russian government intentions in the 2016 election.
The report affirmed that numerous past incidents had motivated the Russian government to wage an influence operation in support of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Vladimir Putin believed that Russia was being demeaned on the international stage by a series of scandals he publicly attributed to the United States, such as the Olympic doping scandal and the Panama Papers. Putin sought to use the leaks of politically damaging material in the U.S. as a method of tarnishing the image of the United States. In addition, Putin also held a personal vendetta against former-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for what he saw as her personal hand in a series of protests in Russia from 2011 to 2012 as well as remarks by Clinton that Putin held were maligning. According to the report, when a Clinton victory appeared likely, Russia shifted its strategy from aiding Trump's candidacy to sabotaging Clinton's legitimacy, and questioning the trustworthiness of the election.
Notably, the Putin government also surmised that their actions would contribute to Russia's aim of threatening and eroding the "US-led liberal democratic order" which Russia views as a threat to its country and the regime.
Release and reception.
On the afternoon of January 6, 2017, the ODNI published the declassified edition of the report titled "Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections", less than one month after the Obama administration had requested a thorough review. Earlier in the day, FBI director James Comey, CIA director John Brennan, NSA director Mike Rogers, and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper briefed President-elect Donald Trump on the classified findings of the intelligence community during a meeting at Trump Tower, and then Comey privately briefed Trump about the most salacious allegations in the Steele dossier. On Tuesday, January 4, Trump tweeted that "the briefing was delayed until Friday", even though no briefing had been scheduled for Tuesday, and he insinuated that information was being withheld from him. After being briefed, Trump called the meeting "constructive" but Comey would later claim that Trump's reaction had disturbed him, compelling him to document the conversation in a memo. The next day, Trump issued a statement claiming "Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results," which some have called a contradiction of the report's insistence that it had not undertaken an analysis of the effect of Russia's influence campaign on voters and public opinion. However, the report also indicates that Russian actions were limited to influence and propaganda, not the voting process itself.
Speaker of the House Paul Ryan acknowledged meddling but insisted that "We cannot allow partisans to exploit this report in an attempt to delegitimize the president-elect's victory." House Minority Leader and Gang of Eight member Nancy Pelosi called the report "really quite a stunning disclosure" and advocated for further declassification and congressional investigation. "The Wall Street Journal" accentuated the report's "surprisingly detailed findings" while "The Washington Post"" called it a "remarkably blunt assessment."
An editorial in "The Moscow Times" accused the report of containing blatant falsities and highlighted the fact that it had intentionally omitted supporting evidence and dedicated a large fraction of its content to scrutinizing RT. Reporter Glenn Greenwald labeled the report "flimsy" and questioned why it contained "old, public-source information" in reference to RT.
 The Senate Intelligence Committee performed an in-depth review of the report and released their initial findings in July 2018. The committee found the report to be "a sound intelligence product."

Oluf Larsen House

The Oluf Larsen House, at 75 S. 100 West in Ephraim, Utah, is a historic pair-house which was built in 1870. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
It is a one-and-a-half-story adobe house with elements of Greek Revival style. In the early 1900s it was plastered and painted to simulate brick, and then later it was stuccoed. It has paired internal stove chimneys and "is a rare example of the TYPE I pair house."
It was home of Oluf Larsen, who was born in Drammen, Norway in 1836. After converting to the LDS church in 1857, he immigrated to Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1861.
The house was home, after 1890, of Ellen G. Dorius, a polygamous wife of C.C.N. Dorius.
The house is on the east side of a north-south street; its front, however, faces north.

Grand View Beach Railway

The Grand View Beach Railway 
was a scenic electric street railway along 
the shore of Lake Ontario from the village 
of Ontario Beach, a suburb of Rochester, to Manitou Beach.
Route.
The railroad was long. For several miles
out of Ontario Beach the road ran along a bluff close to and overlooking the expanse 
of Ontario and about above the level of the water. 
From Rigney's Bluff westward to Manitou the track threaded a 
sandy beach between the great lake and various little 
bays and ponds.

Infrastructure.
The railroad was of modern construction and 
equipment. The track was 45-pound steel T rail. The 
rolling stock consisted of 7 motor cars, five open and two 
closed, and 7 open trail-cars, which could comfortably seat 
60 to 70 persons. Rae motors of 40-horse-power 
were used and the old reliable McGuire truck.
The power plant was located from the eastern terminus of the railroad. 
It was equipped with two Thompson-Houston 8,000-Watt 
generators, two engines of Mclntosh-Seymour and 
three 100-horse-power boilers from the Pierce &amp; Thomas 
shops.
The car-barn, located near 
the power house had storage capacity for 20 cars.
Accidents.
While erecting the last trestle over the Braddock's Bay, a sudden storm arose, and two men working in the middle of the bay on the trestle were drowned before they could be reached by help.
Some derailments and accidents occurred: Twelve people were injured and one of them died, when a crowded car derailed near Charlotte in 1902 and plunged into a gully below. In 1904, four passengers were killed and nine were injured in a collision on the line.
History.
The cars began running in June 1891, but the railroad was in 
an unfinished condition until about August 1. To October 
1st the total earnings were $17,976.08, operating expenses 
$8,500.06, interest and taxes $4,010.34, surplus $4,465.14. 
The total number of passengers carried was 150,000.
The initial officers of the company were: 
The line was subsequently operated by the Rochester, Charlotte &amp; Manitou Beach Railroad (1895-1908) and the Rochester &amp; Manitou Railroad (1908-1925).
The last car ran on the line in 1925.

OTI Festival 1979

The OTI Festival 1979 is the eighth edition of the OTI Festival which was held in Caracas, Venezuela in December 8 in the National Theatre of the Military Academy. The festival was hosted by the Telenovela actor Eduardo Serrano and the beauty pageant contestant Carmen Victoria Pérez. In this edition in which the number of participating countries rose again to 21, Argentina won for the very first time the festival with the performer Daniel Ríolobos and his song "Cuenta conmigo" (Count on me).
Background.
In the original rules of the OTI Festival the participating broadcaster of the winning country would organise the festival in the next year's edition, but in the previous festival those rules could not be applied due to the tough situation in Nicaragua, the winner country in 1977. As a result, Santiago, the capital city of Chile turned into the host city of the festival in 1978. Brazil was the winning country of the last year's edition with Denise de Kalafe and her song "El amor...Cosa tan rara" (Love... Such a strange thing), but again the Iberoamerican Television Organisation decided to organise a draw in order to select the host city of the VIII OTI festival.
Caracas, the capital city of Venezuela, was chosen as the host place of this edition of the festival and Venevision, the participating broadcaster of the Caribbean country turned into the organiser of the event. This festival is remembered in Venezuela as the very first show that was broadcast live in color.
Venue.
The selected venue for this edition of the festival was the Theatre of the Military Academy of Caracas, which is a cultural hall that was built in 1953. This hall, which is located in the district of Santa Mónica, next to the "Avenew of the Porcers, has hosted, since it was opened, many theatrical performances, dance shows (for example those of the Venezuelan Academy of classical dance), concerts, other cultural activities and the beauty contest of Miss Venezuela for many years. Although it initially had a seat capacity for only 400 people, the hall, which is administrated by the Venezuelan Ministry of Defence, was reformed and by the time Caracas was selected as the host place of the OTI Festival the theatre already had seats for more than 1.000 people turning into the biggest theatre of the Venezuelan capital.
This venue was selected after a committee between the head members of Venevision, the privately owned Venezuelan OTI member and participating Broadcaster.
Participating countries.
The number of participating countries returned to the record that was established in the sixth edition of the festival which was held in Madrid back in 1977. Twenty one countries sent a their delegations, performers and bands to Caracas. As usual, both state financed and private broadcasting networks that were active members of the Iberoamerican Television Organisation participated in this edition of the festival, amongst them, the host broadcaster Venevision.
As usual some of the participating countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, and also Venezuela, the host country, selected their participating entrants through live-broadcast national finals in order to select their participants. Other broadcasters with a higher or lower level of technical or economical resources, decided to select their entrant and song internally.
Unlike the previous two years, there were no withdraws in this edition of the festival and two traditional participating countries decided to return to the event such as Guatemala, which had withdrawed in the previous edition after the disappointing place the Guatemalan delegation got in Madrid two years before. Portugal also made the decision to return to the event after a one-year withdrawal because of the also unexpected low result of their performer two years before in the Spanish capital city.
Participating performers.
It must be taken the participation of the Portuguese entrant José Cid, who one year later, in 1980, would represent his country in the Eurovision Song Contest in The Hague getting for his country their best position till 1996. He would return the OTI Festival one year later in 1971.
In México, Televisa decided to select their entrant through their traditional and enormously popular "National OTI Contest", which was their national final. In this edition as happened last year, there was a huge scandal when Estela Nuñez, who was an unknown singer back then,won with the support of the jurors against the preferences of the audience. In that country the favourites to represent México in the international and main OTI Festival were the widely popular performers Yuri and Emmanuel. Although the selection of Estela Nuñez with her song "Vivir sin ti" (To live without you) initially angered the audience, she was applauded after her reprise performance.
The Chilean performer Patricia Maldonado was also selected by the traditional Chilean national final. Although Maldonado was already very popular and recognised in Chile when she was selected, her selection is mainly attributed to her support for the Augusto Pinochet military dictatorship.
Ednita Nazario, who was selected internally by Telemundo to represent Puerto Rico in Caracas, is nowadays a very recognised personality in her home country, in Latin-America and in the Spanish Language communities of the United States of America. In the next edition of the OTI Festival which was held in Buenos Aires, she was awarded because of the composition of the winning song.
The Spanish entrant Rosa María Lobo, who was internally selected and who participated in the OTI Festival with her song "Viviré" (I will live) was already popular in Spain thanks to her participations in the Benidorm Festival and her debut and subsequent studio albums.
The host performer, the Venezuelan Delia Dorta was selected to represent Venezuela after winning the preselection that Venevision used to produce in order to select the competing entrant. She sang in the festival the nostalgic ballad "Cuando era niño" (When I was a kid) which turned into a hit in the Caribbean country.
Daniel Riolobos, who was the Argentine entrant and the one who would attract the most of the attention participated representing his country with the song "Cuenta conmigo" (Count with me) which was composed by the bolero composer Chico Novarro ended up being acclaimed by the jurors.
Presenters.
Two well known Venezuelan presenters, the telenovela actor Eduardo Serrano and the Carmen Victoria Pérez who was very popular at the time and one of the best-known faces in the country for presenting Miss Venezuela for many years, which is to this day the most watched television program in the country, were announced as this year's presenters. Eduardo Serrano, who was, and still is known for his participation in Venezuelan telenovelas, (Latin American soap operas).
As the presenters used to do every year, after the opening act they made a brief introduction of the show highlighting the goals of the OTI as a media organisation and those of the OTI Festival as a showcase of talented performers in Latin America.
When the performance round started, both presenters made a brief individual introduction of the participating singers, quoting the name of the entrants, the lyricist and the director of the Orchestra.
When the performance round ended, the presenters started contacting the jurors of every participating country from the theatre, including the jurors from the host country who were located in the Venevision studios. Both presenters also announced the three most voted contestants when the voting was over.
Running order.
As happened from the inaugural edition in Madrid in 1972 and in the following ones, the host broadcaster, in this case Venevision in collaboration with the Iberoamerican Television Organisation (OTI) organised a draw in Caracas few days before the event took place.
The entrant of the Netherlands Antilles Don Ramon was the first to open the performance round with his song "Mi niño" (My child), which received negative criticism and not a lot of enthusiasm. Anyway this entry got a respectable ninth place, the best one that this country got in the OTI Festival.
The Puerto Rican performer Ednita Nazario was the third one to take the stage with her ballad "Cadenas de fuego" (Fire Chains), which was well received by the local and Venezuelan press turning into one of the main favourites to win the event.
Daniel Riolobos, who represented his country, Argentina was the tenth performer to perform during the night with critical acclaim before the event took place, which made him another main favourite to win the festival.
The host contestant Delia Dorta was the 12th singer to enter the stage with the song "Cuando era niño" (When I was a kid). She was also one of the main favourites to win the event because the ilussion that her entry brought since her selection.
Portugal with José Cid and his song "Na cabana junto à praia" was received with admiration by the audience and by the jurors. He was the sixteenth performer to take the stage.
Another great favourite, the Spaniard Rosa María Lobo was the entrant to end the performance round with her song "Viviré" (I will live).
Voting system.
The voting system followed the same process of the previous years in which the national juries were contacted by telephone by the presenters. Each participating country had seven jurors. The jurors elected, each one, only their favourite song among the participating entries. The scoreborard was located in the left wall of the music hall.
The national juries of every participating country were contacted directly by telephone by the presenters from the National Theatre of the Military Academy in order to know the decision of the jurors. The jury members of Venezuela, the host country, were located in the central studios of Venevision in Caracas.
Result.
The festival was won by the Argentine entrant Daniel Riolobos with his song "Cuenta Conmigo" (Count on me) with 43 points, ten points of difference in comparison with the second position, the host contestant Delia Dorta who got 33 points.
The third position went to the Portuguese José Cid with 32 points, only one point of difference with Delia Dorta, the Venezuelan representative. The furth place went to the Spaniard Rosa María Lobo with the song "Viviré" (I will live) which got 25 points.
There was a tie in the fifth place between the contestant from Brazil Represented by Miltinho with his song "Conselho" (Advice) and the Puerto Rican performer Ednita Nazario with Cadenas de fuego "Fire chains".
The Mexican singer Estela Nuñez got the eight place with 18 points.
The Ecuadorian representative Miguel Ángel Vergara got the last lace with zero points with his song "Como tener tu cariño" (How to have your love)
Impact.
The audience figures just as happened in the previous year, reached the level of 300 million viewers. The show was acclaimed due to the successful debut of the four participating Chilean broadcasters in the color broadcasting. The quality of the sound system and the stage were also highly valued by the media.
Daniel Riolobos, the winner got his career boosted thanks to the victory he got for Argentina, the first one that the South American country would get in their history in the OTI Festival.
Delia Dorta, the second classificate would turn into an important singer in the Venezuelan music scene after her second place in the contest. From then on, her voice would be heard in many TV commercials. She would also appear for many times in the programme Super Sábado Sensacional, the most popular show aired by Venevision.
Miltinho, the famous Brazilian Samba performer who got the fifth place in this edition of the OTI Festival would go on with his already successful career releasing many studio albums and hit songs.
Other performers such as the Peruvian José Escajadillo, specialised in Creollan music would enjoy a successful career after getting the eleventh place in this edition of the festival with the song "Benito Gazeta".

Solvated metal atom dispersion

Solvated Metal Atom Dispersion is a method of producing highly reactive solvated nanoparticles. Samples of the metal (or ceramic) are heated to produce free atoms (or species), as in PVD evaporation. These are then co-depositied with a suitable organic frozen solvent (e.g. toluene) at very low temperatures (on the order of 70K). This is then warmed towards room temperature, producing solvated metal atoms or (over time) larger clusters. Sometimes, catalysts supports (such as SiO2 or Al2O3) are added to improve nucleation, as it can more readily take place on surface OH groups.

The Chicago Conservator

The Chicago Conservator was an American newspaper. Founded by attorney Ferdinand Barnett in 1878, it was the first African-American newspaper in Chicago. 
History.
Barnett founded the newspaper in 1878 and served as co-editor with R. P. Bird. A.T. Hall served as the paper's city editor during its early years and was in charge of the office. During his tenure as editor, Barnett used the newspaper to campaign for the capitalization of the word "Negro". The "Conservator" focused mainly on editorials and commentary, although it did feature factual news pieces. It also published stories chronicling activities at local churches, social clubs and black fraternal organizations.
Alexander Clark and his son Alexander Clark, Jr. purchased the "Conservator" in 1882 and owned it until 1887. In 1884, Alexander Clark Sr. began editing the paper himself.
In 1893, Ida B. Wells began writing for the newspaper. She later purchased a partial ownership in the publication. She married Barnett in 1895 and then took over full ownership of the "Conservator". She was the editor from 1895 to 1897.
After Wells retired to raise her children, D. Robert Wilkins became the editor of the "Conservator". He was a proponent of the Niagara Movement, and the paper became very critical of Booker T. Washington under Wilkins' tenure. Washington was so upset that he gave money to W. Allison Sweeney, the editor of the "Chicago Leader", one of the "Conservator"'s rival publications, hoping to put Wilkins out of business. When that did not work, he tried unsuccessfully to buy the paper.
In January 1908, Wilkins was replaced by Jesse Max Barber, the former editor of "The Voice of the Negro", who had moved to Chicago from Atlanta following the Atlanta race riot. After Barber penned a negative editorial concerning Washington, he used his influence with the "Conservator"'s stockholders to have Barber fired. 
Monroe Alpheus Majors, a supporter of Washington, became the editor of the "Conservator" in 1908 and served in that position until 1911. The paper went out of business in 1914.

Parkland Fuel

Parkland Corporation (previously known as Parkland Fuel Corporation) is a Canadian convenience store operator and independent fuel retailing company based in Calgary, Alberta. Its subsidiaries include several gas station chains, including Pioneer, Fas Gas Plus and Ultramar, as well as several commercial fuel distribution operations. 
It is the largest independent fuel retailing company in Canada, as well as the second-largest convenience store operator. It is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, with a market capitalization of $3.9 billion as of March 2018.
History.
Parkland Industries was founded as Parkland Beef Industries, a publicly traded cattle feedlot. In 1975, it was acquired by Jack Donald, and renamed Parkland Industries. Donald had previously founded and sold a chain of retail gas stations called Parkland Oil Products Ltd. At Parkland Industries, Donald pivoted the company from cattle to fuel retailing; it established Fas Gas Plus, a western Canadian gas station chain, in 1977. In its early years, the company was headquartered in Red Deer, Alberta; it moved to Calgary in the mid-2010s. 
In the following 30 years, the company grew significantly, in the context of offloading of retail gas operations by larger, integrated oil companies. By the end of 2012, the company had 720 gas stations and $4.1 billion in annual revenue. In 2010, it renamed itself Parkland Fuel Corporation. In 2020, it renamed itself to Parkland Corporation.
In 2013, Parkland acquired Elbow River Marketing, with 1,400 rail cars. in late 2014, it announced the acquisition of Pioneer Energy, an Ontario gas station chain with 393 stations, for $378 million. The deal increased the company's station count to over 1000, and was part of a larger acquisition strategy by the company. 
In August 2016, the company announced the acquisition of most of CST Brands' Canadian assets for $965 million, as part of that company's acquisition by Alimentation Couche-Tard for $4 billion. This included the majority of the Ultramar chain, including 490 retail locations and 72 cardlocks in Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada. The sale gave Parkland a total of just over 1,500 retail locations.
As part of Imperial Oil's exit from retail location ownership, Parkland also acquired the remaining On the Run franchise network, Canadian trademarks, and 17 Esso-branded gas stations.
In 2017, Parkland acquired Chevron's Canadian downstream fuel operations for $1.5 billion. As part of the deal, the company acquired the Burnaby Refinery in Burnaby, British Columbia, and increased its station count to 1800.
In October 2018, Parkland announced it would acquire 75% of SOL Investments, a retail gas station operator based in the Caribbean, for $1.57 billion.
Operations.
Parkland's three businesses are retail gas stations, commercial fuel distribution, and fuel supply and wholesaling.
Its retail gas station brands in Canada include Fas Gas Plus (primarily in Western Canada), Pioneer (primarily in Ontario), Ultramar (primarily in Atlantic Canada, Quebec, and Ontario), Chevron (primarily in British Columbia, with locations in Alberta beginning to be opened in 2019) and Race Trac (a franchised brand with independently run locations. Unrelated to the U.S. chain RaceTrac). The company also runs a number of gas stations under the Esso banner. As of the end of 2017, the company has 1848 stations in its network, of which it owns 596. Unlike gas retailing operations owned by integrated oil and gas companies, which generally buy from a single supplier, Parkland sources its fuel from multiple suppliers. 
In 2016, Parkland acquired the On the Run brand and franchise network in Canada from Imperial Oil. The company has since begun to utilize On the Run in conjunction with its own retail petroleum brands to leverage its recognition, and introduced a refreshed version of the brand in 2018.
In addition to its retail arm, Parkland distributes fuel, including propane, diesel, and heating oil, to mainly commercial customers. It operates under various brands, including Bluewave Energy, Sparlings, and Ultramar.

Capone (2020 film)

Capone is a 2020 American biographical drama film written, directed and edited by Josh Trank, with Tom Hardy starring as the eponymous gangster Al Capone. The film centers on Capone after his 11-year sentence at Atlanta Penitentiary, as he suffers from neurosyphilis and dementia while living in Florida. Linda Cardellini, Jack Lowden, Noel Fisher, Kyle MacLachlan, and Matt Dillon also star in supporting roles. First announced in October 2016, production on the film did not begin until March 2018, lasting through May in Louisiana.
Originally intended to have a theatrical release, it was released through Premium VOD by Redbox Entertainment and Vertical Entertainment on May 12, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Hardy's performance received some praise but Trank's script and its uneven tone were criticized.
Plot.
Once the most feared bootlegger in Chicago, mobster Al Capone is brought down when he is convicted of tax evasion. At the age of 40, following nearly a decade of imprisonment, he is released after the government deems him to no longer be a threat as his mind is slowly rotting from untreated neurosyphilis.
Retired and living with his family in Palm Island, Florida, Capone remains under surveillance by FBI agents, as they think he may be faking his insanity. Forced to sell many of his remaining belongings to pay old debts and support himself, Capone begins to have hallucinations and loses control of his motor functions as his disease progresses. He acknowledges that he hid $10 million before he was convicted, although he cannot remember where it is.
After Capone, whose memory is nearly gone, has a physical confrontation with his wife Mae, she instructs her husband's bodyguards to keep everyone away from him. Meanwhile, Capone has increasingly debilitating visions of the men he killed and many of the violent acts he committed. His mental capacity continues to deteriorate, until a psychiatrist hired to evaluate him declares that his IQ is no more than that of a child. Wracked with guilt, and having alienated all around him, Capone eventually dies of complications from his syphilis in January 1947 at the age of 48. His surviving family changes their name from Capone, and the money he allegedly hid away has never been recovered.
Production.
It was announced in October 2016 that Tom Hardy would star as Al Capone in the film, then known as "Fonzo", which would be directed, written and edited by Josh Trank. Filming was initially eyed to begin in the summer of 2017, with Hardy stating it would be released sometime in 2018. Hardy instead ended up filming "Venom" in 2017, and in March 2018 announced "Fonzo" as his next project. Later that month, Linda Cardellini, Matt Dillon, Kyle MacLachlan, Kathrine Narducci, Jack Lowden, Noel Fisher and Tilda Del Toro joined the cast.
Filming began on March 19, 2018 in New Orleans, and lasted through May 15.
On April 15, 2020, the trailer was released with its new title, "Capone".
Rapper and producer El-P composed the score for the film, which was released by Milan Records.
Release.
On May 12, 2020 Vertical Entertainment released the film digitally in the United States and Canada through Premium video on demand. The film was originally set to have a theatrical release, but these plans changed due to movie theater closures that started in mid-March because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. The film received a theatrical release in several regions such as Iceland, Lithuania and Portugal, where it has grossed a combined $112,116.
Reception.
VOD sales.
In its first few days of release, "Capone" was the number-two rented film on iTunes. Over its first weekend, it ranked third on iTunes and fourth on both FandangoNow and Google Play. Over its first ten days the film made $2.5 million from digital sales, a record for Vertical Entertainment. "IndieWire" called the results "quite good" but "far from being a money-[maker]", saying that Vertical would see about 75% of the initial gross ($1.5 million), and that the film could leg out to $4–5 million in sales. In its second weekend of release the film fell to 11th on iTunes and seventh on Fandango. The weekend of August 7, upon lowering the price to $0.99, the film was the second-most rented on the iTunes Store and Apple TV.
Critical response.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 40% based on 138 reviews, with an average rating of 4.80/10. The website's consensus reads: "Tom Hardy makes the most of his opportunity to tackle a challenging role, but "Capone" is too haphazardly constructed to support his fascinating performance." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews."
Writing for "TheWrap", Steve Pond said: "It's nuts, it's a mess and it's pretty damn entertaining if you don't mind characters pooping the bed and getting stabbed in the neck", saying that "Tom Hardy laughs in the face of conventional notions of good v. bad acting." Scout Tafoya writing for "Consequence of Sound" gave the film an A- grade and noted that "Somehow, Trank had energy left over, despite wrangling one of the most eccentric performers working, to make a satisfying haunted house film as well" and called it "one of the most bravely singular and uncommon films you'll see this year."
Owen Gleiberman of "Variety" called the film "the last half hour of "The Irishman" crossed with the doddering-legend parts of "Citizen Kane"" and said that Hardy gives "a mumbly Method showboat performance that's authentic on the surface, but there isn't enough beneath the mob mannerisms." David Ehrlich of "IndieWire" gave the film a "C-" grade and wrote: "Nevertheless, the director and his subject are ultimately buried together in the same boat: We're made to understand their suffering, but given no reason to root for their salvation."

Jess Johnson

Jess Johnson (born 1979) is a New York-based New Zealand contemporary artist who works in drawing, installation, animation, and virtual reality. Her drawings depict alternative realms while her collaborations with Simon Ward and Andrew Clarke adapt the world of her drawings into video animations and virtual reality.
Biography.
Jess Johnson was born in Tauranga, New Zealand in 1979. She grew up in Mount Maunganui, New Zealand and attended University of Canterbury in Christchurch from 1997–2001, where she earned a BFA.
In 2004 she moved to Melbourne, Australia, where she co-founded and ran Hell Gallery from 2008–2011. She began exhibiting her work in group and solo shows throughout Australia in New Zealand, including shows at institutions such as the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney and the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne.
In 2016 she relocated permanently to New York City after participating in the Australia Council's Greene Street residency in SoHo.
Works.
Drawings.
Johnson's drawings typically include bold colors, repetitive and fractal geometric shapes, humanoid figures, alien creatures, and structures that draw from both classical and ancient architecture. They have been likened to the work of Japanese pop-psychedelia artist Keiichi Tanaami. Although the detail and precision of her drawings suggest digital composition, the drawings are all done by hand. Mistakes made during the creation of her drawings "act as mutational directions" that she incorporates into them. She has said: "If I were able to digitally erase my mistakes, I wouldn't necessarily get that organic growth in the world. I like that it's a little out of my control and driven by something else."
About Johnson's drawings, Chloe Mandryk of Art Almanac wrote: 
Jess Johnson's complex and sensuous images use bold colour and a geometric bravura that conjure the glow and kinaesthesia of arcade video games and the 'wormholes' of speculative thought so key to good science fiction. Her humanoids occupy a virtual reality patterns and ancient architectural forms that delineate the boundaries of these imagined spaces.
Johnson has discussed the role of text in the creation of her drawings: 
Whenever I start a new drawing I first choose a piece of text from one of my notebooks. The text is almost always the starting point. Whatever amorphous vibe the words give off determines the imagery that comes. The phrases are often rhythmic and I choose them because they get stuck in my head like thought-worms. The text plays a really practical role in the construction of the drawings. The letters and words are like scaffolding and I often arrange the composition around them. The number of letters gives me mathematical starting points for mapping out other areas.
Animation and virtual reality.
In 2014, Johnson began collaborating with video artist Simon Ward to adapt her drawings into animated video. Their first collaborative work, the single-channel high-definition digital video "Mnemonic Pulse", premiered at Gertrude Contemporary in Melbourne in March 2014. Composer Andrew Clarke created original audio for the piece and continues to collaborate with Johnson and Ward.
The first virtual reality work created by Johnson, Ward, and Clarke, "Ixian Gate", premiered in 2015 as the centerpiece of Johnson's solo exhibition, "WURM HAUS", at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne.
Johnson participated in the Oculus Rift Launchpad Program at Facebook HQ in May 2016.
Johnson and Ward then began creating a series of five HD video animations, each of which translated a single drawing by Johnson into "richly rendered 3-dimensional animations, digitally extrapolating Johnson's planar surfaces into tonally modelled architectures and bodies." Drawings translated in this series (which also serve as the respective names of the collaborative videos) are "Worldweb Allthing" (2017), "Transkin Simulator" (2017), "Whilst In Genuflect" (2017), "Milxyz Wae" (2017), and "Worldken" (2017).
In 2017, the installation piece "WHOL WHY WURLD" collected these five videos and displayed them on five HD televisions mounted on poles around the perimeter of a painted decagon platform. The videos played on a continuous loop. "WHOL WHY WURLD" premiered at "The National 2017" at Carriageworks in Sydney. An edition of "WWW" was acquired in 2018 by Buxton Contemporary in Melbourne and presented as part of the museum's inaugural "The shape of things to come" exhibition. "WHOL WHY WURLD" was a finalist for the 2018 Walters Prize.
Both "Ixian Gate" and "Whol Why Wurld" were featured in Johnson's first solo exhibition in the United States, "Everything not saved will be lost", in September 2017 at Jack Hanley Gallery. The show was reviewed in the November 2017 edition of ArtForum magazine.
In May 2017, Johnson and Ward received a commission from the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) for a major new virtual reality work as part of their Balnaves Contemporary Intervention Series. Five new VR pieces premiered as part of "Terminus", Johnson and Ward's exhibition at the NGA opening 4 May 2018. In an interview in Ocula Magazine, Johnson discussed how her drawing practice translated to her work in VR, as a means to catapult the viewer 'to a different planet entirely.'
Influences.
Johnson has identified a wide range of influences including the ideas of Terence McKenna; Frank Herbert's "Dune" and the works of Alejandro Jodorowsky; the dystopian novel "Riddley Walker" by Russell Hoban; early video games; and comics.
Collections.
Jess Johnson's works are held in the following permanent collections:

Teresa Miller (academic)

Teresa Miller (February 20, 1962 – August 6, 2021) was an American professor, author, legal scholar, educator, and administrator. At the time of her death in August 2021, she was senior vice chancellor for strategic initiatives and chief diversity officer to State University of New York (SUNY) Chancellor Jim Malatras. She previously served as vice chancellor and chief of staff to Chancellor Kristina M. Johnson.
Before moving to SUNY in 2018, Miller had been vice provost for inclusive excellence at the University of Buffalo. She had been a professor of law at the University at Buffalo Law School since 1995.
As a law professor at Buffalo, Miller taught broadly but was probably best known for her work on prison law and her efforts within the Attica Correctional Facility.
Personal life.
Miller was born in Ft. Benning, Georgia on February 20, 1961. She was raised in the tidewater region of Virginia and Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Miller was the daughter of a decorated Army aviator, Billy G. Miller, and a school teacher, Henrietta Thomas, who would go on to earn a Ph.D. from UNC Chapel Hill and become a dean. Miller had five siblings. 
Miller graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in 1979. She was married to Daniel Mikofsky from 1998 to 2007 and later was partnered with Paula DiPerna. She had three children. Her daughter, Seychelle Mikofsky, said Miller's death was caused by gallbladder cancer.
Education.
Miller attended Duke University, where she was an Angier B. Duke Scholar. She received her A.B. from Duke in 1983.
In 1986, she earned her J.D. from Harvard Law School.
In 1989, she earned her Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree from the University at Wisconsin at Madison, graduating as a William H. Hastie Fellow.
Career.
After graduating from law school, Miller taught at the University of Miami School of Law from 1986 to 1988. From 1990 to 1991, she worked as a judicial law clerk at the US District Court in the Southern District of Florida for Judge William Hoeveler.
Miller became a professor of law at the University at Buffalo in 1995. She taught immigration law, prisoner law, criminal procedure, and contracts. Miller was promoted to the rank of full professor of law with tenure.
In March 2014, Miller was appointed the University of Buffalo’s first vice provost for equity and inclusion, a title that was changed in 2017 to vice provost for inclusive excellence.
As vice provost, Miller established the Office of Inclusive Excellence and created the university’s first strategic diversity and inclusion plan.
In 2016, Miller launched the Difficult Conversations (DIFCON) Series. These university-wide discussions invited students, staff, and faculty to come together and share their opinions on controversial topics in a safe and civil environment.
In January, 2018, Miller accepted the position of senior vice chancellor and Chief of Staff to SUNY Chancellor Kristina Johnson.
Professional affiliations.
Inside and outside of the University, Miller was deeply involved with prison and immigration law and diversity initiatives.
As a member of the American Bar Association (ABA) Task Force on Standards for the Legal Status of Prisoners, Miller helped rewrite the Standards on the Legal Status of Prisoners (2010). Miller also served on the Board of the Prisoner Legal Services of New York as well as the Board of the Correctional Association of New York.
Prison Documentary.
In 2009, Miller produced and co-directed a 24 minute short documentary entitled "Encountering Attica".
The documentary takes place within the Attica Correctional Facility, where Miller had worked extensively. The documentary focused on the year-long interactions between three first year Buffalo law students and Attica inmates who were serving life sentences.
In addition to teaching prison law and advocating for the rights of prisoners, Miller also analyzed the experiences of correction officers who work within the prison system; she concluded that officers and prisoners face many of the same experiences and difficulties.

Prisoner Law

In the United States of America, Prisoner Law refers to litigation that determines the freedoms that a prisoner either holds or loses when they are incarcerated. This includes the end of the "Hands- Off Doctrine" and the ability to be protected by the First, Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Furthermore, prisoner laws regulate the ways in which individuals experience privacy in a prison setting. Important case laws have arisen through time that have either hindered or protected prisoners from certain rights. Some include the Hudson v. Palmer case which held that prisoners were not protected against searches and seizures of their prison cells and Wolff v. McDonnell that stated that prisoners shall remain entitled to some of their constitutional rights even after being incarcerated.
Background.
Incarceration rates in the United States have and continue to increase significantly. In comparison to the rest of the world, the United States holds a record for the highest number of incarcerated individuals. In 2015, the prison population estimated approximately 2.2 million people. There has been a rapid increase in the prison population since the 1980s. However, violent crime has significantly decreased from the years 1973 to 2003. In the United States, the majority of inmates are people of color and from low socioeconomic backgrounds.
Historical.
A theoretical form of prison surveillance is called the Panopticon. The Panopticon is a building composed of a middle tower for the surveillance of the surrounding cells. Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon makes it possible that “each individual in his place is securely confined to a cell from which he is seen from the front by the supervisor; but the side walls prevent him from coming into contact with his companions”. In America the first prison was established during the 1790s in Philadelphia which was named after the name "Walnut street".
Hands-off Doctrine.
The Hands-off doctrine was the decision of the federal courts to stay out of the regulating the administration of how prisons and rules for prisoners are decided. In essence this meant that if an inmates’ rights were said to be violated the court would not get in between. This stems from the idea that these corrections institutions knew more about how to make decisions over prisons and prisoners than the courts did. Also, judges believed that if a prisoner became incarcerated then they shall expect to lose their rights. Due to the complexity of the issues that have arisen among prisoners and their rights, the hands-off doctrine in the courts has diminished. This led to a greater awareness of the rights of prisoners as well as increased court involvement within the violation of rights. In fact, the detachment from using the "hands off" approach began during the 1960s and courts started to look into specific violations regarding prisoners. Some of the related cases begin with "Procunier v. Martinez", which was the first case where the Supreme court began to interfere between the prisoner and prison administration relationship. This case revolved around controlling and censoring the correspondence of prisoners. A final decision over this issue was not made until the occurrence of the "Turner v. Safley" case. It concluded that the ability to send mail to and from other prisoners was not allowed in order to keep prisons safe and controlled. Moreover, it was decided that marriage between prisoners was to be allowed. In "Coffin v. Reichard", the idea that prisoners have and should maintain their constitutional rights as human beings was acknowledged. However, becoming incarcerated does in fact take away from many of those constitutional rights. This led to a complexity of cases that decided what protections would be available to prisoners through incarceration.
Prisoner Case Law- General.
The First Amendment.
Both the freedom of Speech and the freedom of religion are protected by the First Amendment. For Prisoners there have been an abundance of case laws that have emerged which protect these rights and the various violations they have faced within prison.
Freedom of Speech.
Prisoners have the freedom to send and receive correspondence and visitations from their loved ones. In some instances this right may be limited for the safety and security of the prison. Correspondence is largely monitored by the prison staff. The case "Carothers v. Follette", portrays an instance where a prisoner wrote about the prison administration in his letters and was then penalized for it. As a result, the courts concluded that prisons may penalize prisoners for the way they express themselves only if it interferes with the functioning of the prison. In addition, prisons get to decide who is allowed to send prisoners mail and who they can send mail to by implementing a set mailing list. Prisoners are entitled to receive legal aid when needed. When it comes to communicating with their attorneys, prisoners are allowed to talk with them in person and without major surveillance. They also have the right to reach out to "petition for redress of grievances" which was decided in the case Nolan v. Fitzpatrick. This gave prisoners the right to be able to express their complaints and expose prison conditions to the outside world.
Freedom of Religion.
The courts respect the right to freedom of religion in prison, however, they focus largely on protecting this freedom of all prisoners equally. The growth of the conversion to the religion of Islam within prisons prompted litigation cases to arise. Prisoners may not be discriminated based on their religious beliefs but certain religious practices may be restricted in prison. The "Brown v. Peyton", case revolved around the rights of Black Muslim prisoners in which they believed that their rights of freedom to practice religion were violated. Similarly, in "Fulwood v. Clemmer", Black Muslin prisoners fought for their right to practice their religion in prison. It was ruled that because their practices disrupted the prison environment that they could be penalized for such practices. "Walker v. Blackwell", is a case which fought for the needs of Muslim prisoners to eat at specific times due to their religious practice of Ramadan but were eventually denied. The courts decided that it was not cost efficient and also raised safety issues.
Despite the growth of conversions to Islam within prisons in the 1950s, states such as California, New York and Texas still had not yet recognized or accommodated the religious activity of Muslim inmates by the start of the 1960s. As the number incarcerated Muslims began to reach a critical mass, prisoners petitioned courts to advance their religious rights. The Hands-off Doctrine began to diminish during the 1960s as courts started to look into specific violations regarding prisoners. Cases involving Muslim prisoners began succeeding in gaining recognition for a variety of rights over the next several years, such as freedom from punishment due to religion, the right to hold religious services, the right to possess and wear religious medals, and the right to proselytize. New York's Department of Corrections offered to hire Muslim chaplains as department employees by 1975. These legal victories not only solidified Islam as a legitimate religion among corrections staff and prisoners, but also placed Muslim groups at the center of the prisoners' rights movement for obtaining constitutional rights for the incarcerated.
Prisoner Privacy law.
The Fourth Amendment.
As part of the constitution, the Fourth Amendment protects prisoners' privacy by forbidding “unreasonable searches and seizures” of individuals' property. There are a variety of cases that fought to protect this privacy right, yet there are many cases that attempted to take it away. For example, the case "Lanza v. New York" ruled that prisons and inmates would not be protected under the fourth amendment. Further, in "Bell v Wolfish" which had to do with searches and seizures it was decided that prisoners shall not expect to have any privacy in prison. Both of these cases ruled against the protection of prisoners themselves being search or their property from being confiscated. However, in "Wolff" v "McDonnell" the courts established that prisoners should still be entitled to some rights even if they have committed a crime. In addition, the 1975 "Bonner v. Coughlin" case also protects that these privacy rights remain available to individuals in prison, to an extent. Searches and seizures of inmates and their property in prison occur without any prior announcement. The function of this is to search for any unauthorized property that inmates may be hiding and are needed in order to prevent or get rid of unauthorized property. In the case "Parrat v Taylor" an inmate's property was destroyed by a member of the prison staff which was not ruled as a violation by the courts. Essentially, this decision supported the conclusion that prisons must prioritize their own security and well-being over the privacy rights of inmates. Moreover, in the 1984 "Hudson v. Palmer" case, the Supreme Court decided that the privacy rights of inmates against searches were not protected.The case stated that this was important in order to maintain control and security within the prisons. Additionally, the case "Timm v. Gunter" decided that searches and seizures were not in violation of an inmates rights if it was for the sake of the prison and its security. Similarly, the case "Levoy v. Mills" ruled that no matter how big the invasion of privacy, it must be rightfully justified for the prison's welfare in order to be held in the prisons favor.
The Eighth Amendment.
The Eighth amendment of the constitution is a protection of individuals against " cruel and unusual punishment". When Prisoners are subjected to monitoring, observation and searches this amendment may be violated. Two cases that explore this further are "Jackson v. Werner" and "Jordan v. Gardner". In "Jackson v. Werner", the courts decided that there was no violation with searching and observing because it is all supposed to be for the good of a prison institution. It stated that inmates should get used to this due to the fact that they are within the boundaries of an institution that is meant to punish them. In "Jordan v. Gardner", the courts made a decision based on the idea that inmates may have had previously experienced sexual abuse or harassment. The decision was oriented towards preventing more trauma for inmates and ruled that searches and observations may cause an "infliction of pain". Additionally, in the case, Estelle v. Gamble, a situation occurred in which the right to health care was not given to a prisoner and had his health conditions worsen. This led to a conclusion that decisions like these could lead to worsening conditions of prisoners, and violates the eighth amendment because this denial could further cause a cruel and unusual punishment.
The Fourteenth Amendment.
The Fourteenth Amendment of the constitution protects individuals' privacy and one instance is being "observed by strangers naked or stripped of [their] clothes" Due to the way that prisons function these privacy rights may not be protected by the fourteenth amendment. Female guards employed within male prisons have the right to walk around areas in which men may be naked or using the restrooms. Along with being able to monitor these areas they are also allowed to search the men if needed. This also occurs with female prisons within where men are employed. According to a report from the Human Rights Watch, male corrections officers have abused their right to search prisoners. This includes the harassment and sexual abuse of female prisoners. Consequently, officers have threatened female inmates to engage in sexual activity with them. In court, prisoners may be subjected to prove that they have been wrongly harassed and that their privacy has been breached in order to be protected.
Privacy in the prison setting.
Prisoner Privacy within a prison setting includes the ways that prisoners experience privacy through communicating with others, their physical prison environments and the protection of their health.
Communication methods.
Most inmates have methods available to them to communicate with individuals outside of prison. These methods include access to sending and receiving mail, telephone calls, and visitation rights. Writing letters is a popular way in which inmates maintain contact with the outside world. Letters are a way for both inmates and their family members to communicate with each other via mail. All of the mail that enters or leaves the facility is read and gone through by the prison staff and guards. Similarly, telephone calls are accessible to most inmates except those who are placed in solitary confinement. The allowed duration of the calls tend to be approximately fifteen minutes long. Phone calls are monitored and recorded; there are also key words that may cause the disconnection of calls by guards, for example: profanity. Inmates have the option to receive visits from family members and friends. These visitations vary from three to six hours in length and are consistently monitored by prison guards. Aside from being monitored by guards there are an abundance of cameras in the visitation rooms for surveillance of these interactions. All physical interactions are strictly limited. Aside from their encounter being monitored family members undergo searches upon entering the facility for visitations. These visits "can be humiliating and degrading" for the visitor.
Physical Environments.
In prison the physical environments that prisoners are exposed to are becoming more overcrowded through time. However, aside from dealing with overcrowded spaces they face a privacy concern regarding corrections officers. Corrections officers risk losing their jobs or not attaining a job at all within prisons of the opposite sex in order to maintain the privacy of inmates. When privacy of inmates is protected by disallowing guards to wander private areas those areas become more dangerous to the inmates. On the other hand, if those areas are monitored than inmates may lose their sense of privacy. In order to secure the privacy of inmates, oftentimes individuals of the opposite sex are denied employment in prisons. This occurred in the case "Dothard v. Rawlison" where a female was discriminated against when applying to a male prison in the state of Alabama. The supreme court focused on arguing that females are sexually susceptible in a male environment. This was justified by the idea that if a female was to work in a male prison that prisoners would become more violent. In "Bowling v. Enimoto" male inmate rights were challenged by deciding that these inmates have the right not to be monitored while either showering, changing or using the restroom. Similarly, in "Forts v. Ward" females' inmate rights were challenged.The case ruled that there was a need to block surveillance of areas such as showers and toilets.
Health.
The case "Estelle v. Gamble" ruled that inmates have the right to receive health care in prison. It also established that if prisoners want to get an abortion that they are entitled to do so. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rule applies to health care in prison. HIPAA's privacy rule protects everything pertaining to a prisoners health. However, under HIPAA's "Permissible Use and Disclosure Exception" it is okay for prisons to share inmate's information with other institutions when needed and without their approval. There are various ways that privacy is breached in terms of the health of inmates and these breaches form barriers for access to healthcare. First, a variety of blood tests can be conducted on prisoners at any moment for any reason and is not protected by the fourth amendment. A lack of trust drives prisoners to feel uncomfortable when voicing health issues to the guards. Also, overcrowding in prisons has led to the spread of health related issues and diseases. The National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) has disclosed that the transmission of diseases and other health related issues is high in prisons and can spread further after an inmate is released Diseases that can be transmitted are constantly monitored. Also, this is immediately communicated to public health officials.
Some examples of these health issues and disease are:
Controversies.
Observations, Searches of Inmates, and Gender.
Controversy exists with gender in prison as a double standard. In one instance if same gender observations or searches are conducted then it is stated to be required in order to keep prisons safe and secure. On the other hand, if this occurs with opposite genders then a violation of prisoner rights arises. It is more likely to become a violation or an intrusion if these observation and searches take place on behalf of the opposite sex. Oftentimes, the decisions of federal judges are shaped by different stereotypes that characterize men and women. Because of this, according to the courts, females have a higher expectation of privacy than males do.
Conflict between prisoners and correctional officers.
In the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII protects the employment rights of workers against any discrimination pertaining to who they are or where they come from. However, there is a debate between inmates' privacy rights versus corrections officers' and equal employment rights. Complaints come from prisoners because they believe that their privacy is breached by guards of the opposite sex. Contrarily, guards complain that they are being discriminated against when it comes to obtaining a job within an institution of the opposite sex. An example of a violation of the equal employment rights is shown in "Brooks v. Industries". This is seen mainly with cross-gender searches. In the case, "Brooks v. Industries", a female janitor working in a male prison lost her position due to gender in prison issues. The decision concluded that having to clean a male bathroom should not be done by a female because it would invade the male privacy. Conflicts like these lead to a call to balance the two situations in the best way possible.

Leo J. Sullivan

Leo J. Sullivan (December 8, 1905 – February 1, 1963) was an American government official from Boston who served as commissioner of the Boston Police Department from 1957 to 1962.
Early life.
Sullivan was born on December 8, 1905 in South Boston. He attended The English High School and Saint Anselm College.
Political career.
Sullivan began his political career in 1934 as an unsuccessful candidate for the Massachusetts House of Representatives. It would be the only defeat he suffered in his career. He was elected to the House in 1936 and served there from 1937 to 1941. From 1941 to 1947 he represented the 4th Suffolk District in the Massachusetts Senate. In 1946 he defeated 40-year incumbent W. T. A. Fitzgerald to become Suffolk County Register of Deeds. As register, Sullivan worked to modernize the office. This included photostating every document which came through the registry and making microfilms of all the records in the land division. Sullivan managed Foster Furcolo's campaign in Suffolk County during the 1956 gubernatorial election.
Police Commissioner.
In 1957, Furcolo appointed Sullivan to the position of Boston police commissioner. During his tenure as commissioner, Sullivan broke up the special service squad, established a juvenile squad, and eliminated 101 positions from the department (which saved the city $550,000 a year). He supported consolidation of stations and opposed legislation to return the department under city control. In 1961, CBS aired a program called "Biography of a Bookie Joint", which showed police officers entering and exiting Swartz's Key Shop, an illegal gambling parlor. 
Governor John A. Volpe hired James D. St. Clair to prepare removal proceedings against Sullivan. After Sullivan refused to resign, Volpe brought him before the Massachusetts Governor's Council's on charges of splitting renovation and repair contracts, failing to advertise contract bids, engaging in the insurance business while serving as commissioner, and neglecting his duty by not ordering an investigation into the officers who were filmed visiting Swartz's Key Shop. Sullivan resigned on March 15, 1962, during the hearings on his removal.
Death.
Sullivan died on February 1, 1963, at his home in South Boston.

Dario Anselmo

Dario Anselmo (born May 2, 1962) is an American politician and former member of the Minnesota House of Representatives. He is nonpartisan-affiliated.
Early life, education, and career.
Anselmo was born on May 2, 1962. His father was a district court judge in Duluth, Minnesota. He grew up in Orono, MN and graduated from Orono High School before attending Whittier College, Boston University, and the University of Minnesota.
At age 21, Dario co-founded a technology company that dealt with the emerging market for personal computers called Radix, Inc. After his first business, Anselmo went on to own the Fine Line Music Cafe in Minneapolis for 20 years before selling it in 2013. He served on the boards of several non-profit and civic groups, including Edina Give and Go, the Edina Education Fund, and the Minneapolis Downtown Council. Anselmo was also the president of the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, which later merged with the Mental Health Association of Minnesota.
He is a co-founder of the Warehouse District Business Association and a commercial real estate owner and operator.
Minnesota House of Representatives.
Anselmo was first elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2016, as a Republican representing District 49A in the southwestern Twin Cities metropolitan area. He sat on the Education Committee and Legacy Funding Committee.
While in office, Anselmo introduced legislation to increase the age required to purchase cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and chewing tobacco in Minnesota to 21 and co-sponsored legislation for universal background checks before gun purchases. Later, Anselmo appeared on the Twin Cites PBS show Almanac to discuss the need for “Tobacco 21” legislation. 
He also passed a bill that reduced Social Security taxes by 50% and co-authored a bill to reduce property taxes for small businesses. 
According to the Pioneer Press, Anselmo held an W-NOMINATE score of 0.197, which made him one of the most moderate members of the state legislature during his tenure. 
In 2018, Anselmo lost his re-election bid to Heather Edelson. After Anselmo’s loss, he shared a drink with Edelson that ended up in a story on MPR News online.

Duarte Borges Coutinho

Duarte António Borges Coutinho, 4th Marquess of Praia e Monforte (18 November 1921 – 19 May 1981), commonly known simply as Borges Coutinho, was the 26th president of Portuguese sports club S.L. Benfica.
Born in Lisbon and educated both in England and Portugal, Borges Coutinho became a member of Benfica in 1959, aged 37. Ten years later, he became president of the club after defeating candidates Fernando Martins and Romão Martins in the elections on 12 April 1969, with 58 percent of the votes. During his eight-year presidency (four consecutive biennal terms), the football team won seven Primeira Liga titles (personal record) – one of them without defeat, in the 1972–73 campaign – and three Taça de Portugal trophies. This allowed Benfica to consolidate their hegemony in Portuguese football.
Under Borges Coutinho's term, in 1969, Benfica took possession of lands near their stadium, Estádio da Luz, in order to create three football pitches, one synthetic athletics track, and eight tennis courts. He was awarded with the (Golden Eagle) by the club in 1973. After deciding not to contest the elections on 26 May 1977, he was succeeded by José Ferreira Queimado.
Borges Coutinho died at the age of 59 in Greater London, England.

Hatif

Hatif () is a voice that can be heard without one's discovering the body that made it.
Pre-Islamic Arabs credited jinn with such "hatif" avenging murder on a fellow jinn by driving the murderer insane.
Al-Jahiz wrote that the Bedouin believed the jinn could be used as transmitters of important messages. The receiver would hear the message in realtime without seeing the speaker. He stated that belief in Hatif was widespread among the Bedouin, and they would be perplexed that people could disbelieve in it. Al-Masudi focused on the psychological backgrounds of this phenomenon, and explained the Hatif as a hallucination caused by loneliness.
In some cases, the voice does not come from jinn, but from ghosts, dwelling near graves and remember humans about their mortality or announce their death.

<doc id="56859591" url="?curid=56859591" title="Lyotropy">
Lyotropy

Lyotropy (a portmanteau of lyo- "dissolve" and -tropic "change") refers to concentration-dependent physical effects in solutions and often more specifically to ion-specific behavior in aqueous solutions.
History.
Ions in an aqueous solutions display ion specific behavior that has been commonly exemplified by the Hofmeister series. Stemming from observations by Franz Hofmeister in the 1870s with egg white lysozyme, lyotropic effects led to a classification of ions on their abilities to salt in or salt out proteins. 
Because of the positive charge of lysozyme, the original series turned out to be different that the series for most proteins. Thus, the series can change depending on the protein in solution and the concentrations of the ions in solution. Lyotropy- like the Hofmeister series- classifies ions and their abilities to salt in/ salt out proteins.
In 1936, Voet investigated lyotropic behavior to quantify the effects of salt action on molecules and predict the behavior using mathematical models. Using agar and gelatin, he formulated an equation to predict the salting-out action of different ions for other colloids.
Lyotropic activity also influences swelling of gels, surface tension, rate of saponification processes, viscosity of salt solutions, and heats of hydration.
Ion pairing equilibria in sea water.
The current understanding of ion-pairing equilibria in an aqueous environment can also be traced to the Eigen-Tamm model that introduced the use of two equlibria states for ion pairs: the contact ion pair (CIP) and the separated ion pair (SIP). As an early application of ion-pairing equilibria, Kester and Pytkowicz studied the role of sulfate and divalent cation ion-pairing in seawater. 
This ion-specific behavior was also elucidated through Collin's Law of Matching Water Affinities that describes the strength of ion-pairing in terms of ion size and counterion, while also incorporating coordination state and entropy. Modern computational approaches to simulation of ion-pairing involve molecular dynamic simulations and ab initio calculations that often incorporate polarizable continuum solvent models.
Implications.
Following the law of matching water affinities, chaotrope-chaotrope and kosmotropes-kosmotrope pairs prefer the CIP state; whereas, chaotrope-kosmotrope prefer SIP or unpaired states. Another important lyotropic effect is the pairing of ions to charged headgroups of biological molecules. Vlachy et al. proposed that from chaotropic to kosmotropic headgroups, the ordering follows carboxylate, sulfate and sulfonate groups. In this context, a sodium ion (Na+) will prefer a carboxylate, and a potassium ion (K+) will prefer a sulfonate, which has important partitioning effects in biological systems. Protein solubility depends on pH and salt concentration, where small changes in the local environment can lead to Hofmeister series reversals.
In aqueous solutions of glycans, lyotropic ion-pairing effects often dominate molecular interactions by controlling salt-bridge binding. Modern computational approaches in salt-bridge formation in proteins demonstrate mechanisms underlying the favorable arginine-arginine pairing that is due to reduction in electrostatic repulsion due to pi-stacking interactions.
In carbohydrates, electrostatic and ion pairing are the dominant mechanisms for molecular interactions. Modern computational approaches in salt bridge formation in protein demonstrate that the favorable arginine-arginine pairing (i.e. conserved arginine) is due to reduction in electrostatic repulsion.
Electrolyotropy.
Electrolyotropy incorporates Donnan-potential spatial gradients and ion-specific pairing, and is used to determine the distribution of the ions and electric potential by modeling charges as being either fixed or free. A canonical example is a surface-tethered polyelectrolyte brush with a variety of different fixed charged groups interacting with free ions and ion-pairs to minimize Gibbs free energy. 
Using streaming current measurements in a microslit electrokinetic system (MES), electrolyotropic theory can be used to determine stoichiometric dissociation constants of ion pairing. This approach proves useful in characterizing complex polyelectrolytes and mixtures of ions in solutions like those found in biological systems. In fact, pH and salt concentrations directly affect stoichiometric dissociation constants. Application of electrolyotropic theory has been proposed as a model of mucosal tissue.

Frederick Hutson

Frederick Hutson is an American businessman and founder of Pigeonly, a technology company that makes it easy for people to search, find and communicate with an incarcerated loved one. A born entrepreneur, he launched and sold his first business at the age of 19 while on active duty in the United States Air Force.
Early life.
Frederick Hutson grew up in Brooklyn, NY with a single mother and three siblings. He moved to St. Petersburg, Florida where he attended Brandon High School. He then served in the US Air Force where he worked on jet engines at the Nellis Air Force Base as an electrician. During his time in the Air Force he launched and ran several businesses, including a window-tinting business that made about $50,000 when he was 19. He was honorably discharged in 2005 after the base began downsizing, and eventually turned his business efforts to sending marijuana through the parcel companies. The business netted approximately $500,000 annually. Hutson was arrested by the DEA, and Hutson served a sentence of 51 months beginning in 2007 at the age of 23, The indictment was for shipping approximately 2 tons of marijuana, accepting marijuana from Mexico and shipping it to Florida. He was released in 2012 to a half-way house.
Pigeonly.
While in prison Hutson encountered the difficulty that American inmates have with communicating with their family and friends outside of the institution, and developed an idea for delivering communications for individuals residing in prison. After leaving prison he founded a company, Pigeonly, which prints out electronic communications for prisoners and mails them through the postal system to them in order to be better accepted by the prison system. His business venture was accepted in the incubators "Y Combinator" and "NewMe". The enterprise was cofounded in 2013 with Alfonzo Brooks, whom had employed Hutson during his final year in prison when Hutson was admitted to a work release program. Hutson currently serves as the company’s CEO. By 2015 the company had forwarded around a million pieces of mail and facilitated about eight million minutes of telephone calls.

Frank McNaughton

Frank McNaughton (ca. 1906–1978) was a 20th-century American newspaper journalist, best known for as Congressional affairs correspondent in Washington, DC, for "Time" magazine.
Career.
Around 1935, McNaughton joined United Press news agency.
During the 1940s, McNaughton joined "Time" magazine as their Washington correspondent on Congressional affairs. He wrote nearly forty cover stories. In March–April 1946, he toured American military bases in the Pacific Ocean to report on the mishandling of surplus from World War II. On July 26, 1946, he wrote in an internal memo that stated "Harry Truman could not carry Missouri now."
In 1950 while still with "Time", McNaughton joined NBC Television's "Meet the Press". On August 27, 1950, he helped interview Mike Quill, co-founder and long-time president of the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) and asked him regarding union leader Harry Bridges, "Do you think he ought to be deported (from the United States)" and also "Do you believe he's a Communist?" (Quill answered, "I don't believe so" and "I don't know.")
In 1953, McNaughton and former colleague John Scottjoined a speaking team for "Time" magazine's Education Department, a special program that targeted U.S. college students.

Diuris concinna

Diuris concinna, commonly called the elegant donkey orchid, is a species of orchid which is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has up to five linear leaves at its base and up to five pale yellow flowers with brown markings. It is found along the south coast, often growing in areas that are flooded in winter and flowering more prolifically after fire the previous summer.
Description.
"Diuris concinna" is a tuberous, perennial herb, usually growing to a height of , although often up to when surrounded by sedges. Between three and five linear leaves emerge at the base, each leaf long and wide. Up to five pale yellow flowers with brown markings, wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is more or less erect, egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear to sword-shaped, green and purplish, long, about wide, turned downwards and parallel to each other. The petals are curved backwards, spread apart from each other, sometimes almost horizontal, with an elliptic blade long and wide on a reddish-brown stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped, long, wide and the side lobes are egg-shaped, long and wide. There are two ridge-like calli long near the mid-line of the base of the labellum. Flowering occurs between September and December, reaching a peak in mid-October.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris concinna" was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Esperance, and the description was published in "Australian Orchid Review". The specific epithet ("concinna") is a Latin word meaning "well-arranged, skilfully joined, beautiful [or] striking".
Distribution and habitat.
The elegant donkey orchid grows in winter-wet areas, usually between low shrubs or sedges between the Cape Arid and Fitzgerald River National Parks in the Coolgardie, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions.
Conservation.
"Diuris concinna" is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Ted Valentine

Theodore Valentine (born circa 1959) is an American college basketball referee. Over a career spanning four decades he has refereed four NCAA championships, 10 Final Fours, and 28 NCAA tournaments. In 2005, he won the Naismith College Official of the Year.
Early life and career.
Valentine grew up in a high-income, gated community, just outside of Moundsville, West Virginia. He was raised by his mother, who was a worker at a Louis Marx and Company factory, making big wheel tricycles. His mother would put cardboard into her shoes over worn soles to save money. He did not know his father until junior high. In the same year he met his father, he witnessed a friend die from an accidental gunshot wound to the head. Following this, he developed a stutter, for which he saw two speech therapists. He attended John Marshall High School, where he played baseball for three years.
He attended Glenville State College, where he majored in physical education. He played first base for his college team. He graduated in 1980. Though he did not play basketball, he was a manager on his college's basketball team. He was inducted into his college's sports hall of fame in 2006, after lettering in baseball. Following college, he returned to John Marshall High School, becoming a physical education and driver's education teacher, as well as a coach. In 1985, he was an assistant coach for the John Marshall High School baseball team that won the West Virginia Class AAA State Championship.
While Valentine has never played organized basketball, he has coached, if briefly. While in college, he was a student teacher at Weston Junior High in Weston, West Virginia. He was an assistant coach for the school's junior high girls team. The head coach had taken maternity leave, leading to Valentine being the substitute head coach for a game. He received three technicals before half time, and was ejected. On his way off the court, he passed the principal of the school who said "You just coached your last game."
Following knee surgery, Valentine moved to Charleston, South Carolina in 2003. In addition to refereeing, Valentine also works part-time for the North Charleston Recreation Department.
Basketball referee career.
While doing janitorial work in a gym on work-study program in college, Valentine had observed basketball referees and decided he wanted to be a college basketball referee. He talked with some referees about how to get started in the profession, and took a class. He began refereeing at kids games, later moving up to junior high and high school games. In 1981, he attended a refereeing camp in Bristol, Connecticut run by NBA Hall of Fame member Dallas Shirley. While there, he poured out a cooler of ice water from a window onto sunbathers below the window. Shirley threw Valentine out of the camp for the stunt. A few months later, Shirley offered him a job as a referee.
Valentine worked his first NCAA Division I basketball game in 1981 at the former Baptist College, now Charleston Southern University. He was paid $150 for the game, and received speeding tickets both on the way and returning from the game. In 1986, he was hired by Bob Wortman, who was then the Big Ten Conference's director of officials. Wortman was looking to diversify his staff, and after an interview offered Valentine a job refereeing 30 games. Wortman personally trained Valentine. He quit teaching and became a full-time college referee in 1988. Before his first NCAA Championship game, Valentine lost his official pass and nearly did not get into the game.
Valentine refereed his first final four in 1991. He worked 26 consecutive NCAA tournaments until 2015, when he stepped aside from his work to spend time with his brother, who was dying from cancer.
Valentine was to work the 2021 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in Indianapolis but was sent home because of COVID-19 protocols as he either tested positive or was in close contact with a fellow referee who tested positive after arriving in Indianapolis.
Valentine is sometimes referred by the nickname of "TV Teddy" for his sometimes theatrical officiating.
Controversies.
On February 24, 1998, Valentine officiated a game between Indiana and Illinois. Valentine called three technical fouls during the game on Bob Knight; one in the first half, and two in the second half. Ed Hightower, also an official for the game, attempted to get Valentine to rescind the second technical, which Valentine had issued against Knight for Knight walking onto the floor to attend to an injured player, which is allowable under NCAA rules. Valentine refused to rescind the call. Knight vociferously protested, resulting in the third technical. Knight later referred to Valentine's officiating as "the greatest travesty" he had witnessed over his career. Knight was fined $10,000 by the Big Ten Conference. Valentine was censured for making the "clearly erroneous" second technical, and was placed under restrictions for non-conference Big Ten Conference basketball games for the following season.
On March 1, 2014 during a game involving the Cincinnati Bearcats, the team's coach Mick Cronin contested an out of bounds call. Valentine got into Cronin's face and the two men needed to be separated. Valentine later apologized.
On January 3, 2018 Valentine was involved in an incident during an Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) game where Joel Berry II was coming to talk to him about a call. Valentine turned his back on Berry rather than discuss the call with him. Following this, he was removed from officiating two Big Ten Conference games. He contemplated retirement for a time following this incident. Valentine apologized to Berry at the next game of Berry's that Valentine was officiating. Berry's head coach Roy Williams was not critical of Valentine's officiating in the game. The ACC indicated they were handling the incident internally, and a week after the game, a spokesman for the ACC said the incident was a non-issue. In March, 2018, Valentine was informed he would not be working the 2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. Valentine believes the banishment from the tournament stems from the January incident.
Personal life.
He has one daughter, Joneesha, and a granddaughter.

Rainbow Days (film)

 is a 2018 Japanese coming-of-age drama and romance film based on the manga of the same name by Minami Mizuno. The film is directed by Ken Iizuka and was released in Japan on July 6, 2018 by Shochiku and Warner Bros. Pictures.
Plot.
Four best friends — pure-hearted Natsuki Hashiba, ladies' man Tomoya Matsunaga, "otaku" Tsuyoshi Naoe, and sadistic Keiichi Katakura — approach their second year of high school. During spring, Natsuki works up the courage to talk to Anna Kobayakawa, who lends him her hand towel after he falls into a puddle. His attempt to return it to her fails when he is intercepted by her protective best friend, Mari Tsutsui. The boys make a bet for Natsuki to ask Anna out by the end of the semester, and he succeeds in getting her Line ID, to Mari's anger.
In the summer, Natsuki, Tomoya, and Keiichi fail their exams and seek help from Tsuyoshi and his girlfriend Yukiko Asai, to which they also invite Anna. Later, Yukiko discovers that Tsuyoshi plans on applying to a university in Tokyo. After the boys pass their remedial exams, they go to a summer festival with the girls. While Natsuki grows closer to Anna, Tomoya learns that Mari fears that he will steal Anna away. In the fall, during guidance counseling, Tsuyoshi becomes conflicted over choosing between his college choices and his relationship with Yukiko. Anna becomes confused when she sees that Natsuki's classmate, Chiba, is close to him, and she is later saved from unwanted advances from another boy when Keiichi pretends to be her boyfriend.
In the winter, Tomoya distracts Mari from interrupting Natsuki and Anna's day out and later invites her to a Christmas party. Mari attends, but discovers it is a surprise birthday party for her planned by Natsuki and Anna. Upset, she runs off, causing everyone to look for her. When Tomoya finds her, she confesses that she feels she is no longer Anna's closest friend, and he kisses her. Meanwhile, Natsuki develops a fever during the search and accidentally kisses Anna. After winter break, Natsuki and Anna's relationship becomes awkward, while Tomoya admits to Mari that he has fallen in love with her. Mari is knocked unconscious when she walks away from him, and after carrying her to the nurse's office, Tomoya tells Mari's older brother, Masaomi, that he is confident in winning her over. Masaomi conveys this to Mari, and she realizes how genuine his feelings are after Tomoya confirms he has deleted phone numbers from other girls.
As the boys become third year students with the arrival of spring, Anna overhears Natsuki helping Chiba rehearse for their play at the cultural festival, misinterpreting their conversation as a love confession. She begins to ignore him, putting distance between the two. Keiichi tells the boys that he will pursue Anna if Natsuki doesn't, causing Tomoya and him to get into a fight. Once Tsuyoshi warns Natsuki that Keiichi is going to confess to Anna, he chases after them. Revealing his threat to be a ruse, Keiichi gives Natsuki and Anna time together in the planetarium exhibit, where they confess their love to each other and kiss. Outside, everyone has discovered the rain has stopped and a rainbow has formed in the sky.
In a mid-credits scene, the boys jump into the school's swimming pool and later graduate from high school.

Stephens' constant

Stephens' constant expresses the density of certain subsets of the prime numbers. Let formula_1 and formula_2 be two multiplicatively independent integers, that is, formula_3 except when both formula_4 and formula_5 equal zero. Consider the set formula_6 of prime numbers formula_7 such that formula_7 evenly divides formula_9 for some power formula_10. The density of the set formula_6 relative to the set of all primes is a rational multiple of
Stephens' constant is closely related to the Artin constant formula_13 that arises in the study of primitive roots.

Fang Su-min

Fang Su-min () is a Taiwanese politician.
She is married to Lin Yi-hsiung. Fang visited her imprisoned husband in 1980 and contacted Amnesty International about their meeting, during which Lin disclosed that he had been tortured. After Fang's visit, her twin daughters and mother-in-law were . Fang escaped the stabbing entirely, as she was attending a public hearing held regarding the events of the Kaohsiung Incident, the cause of Lin Yi-hsiung's arrest. Fang and her surviving daughter moved to the United States after the attack. In October 1983, Fang returned to Taiwan and began campaigning for a seat on the Legislative Yuan. The "Taipei Times" wrote in 2000 that Fang contested the election hoping to find out what happened to her family. The publication noted that her campaign was driven by "[s]upporters' tears, anger, and talks of revenge," though Fang said later that she personally "did not have vengeance in my mind." Fang received approximately 121,000 votes in the 1983 election cycle, and won the third most votes overall. During Fang's legislative term, on 15 August 1984, Lin Yi-hsiung was released. A funeral for her mother-in-law and daughters followed in January 1985. As a legislator, she advocated for the release of other prisoners, namely tangwai activist Pai Ya-tsan. After Fang stepped down from the Legislative Yuan, she and Lin established the Chilin Foundation in 1991.

Franz Ferdinand von Rummel

Franz Ferdinand von Rummel (28 October 1644, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, – 15 March 1716, Vienna) was educator and religious tutor of Emperor Joseph I, Bishop of Tinin, Provost of Ardagger and Wroclaw, and was from 1706 to 1716 the Prince-Bishop of Vienna.
Biography.
Ferdinand studied law, philosophy and theology in Ingolstadt and wanted to enter the Capuchin Order. Marco d'Aviano prophesied his success as a priest and recommended him, after Rummel's ordination in Regensburg, to be an educator and religious tutor to the future Emperor Joseph I. In addition, the wife of Emperor Leopold I, Eleonor Magdalene of Neuburg, favored him because his grandfather, Johann Rummel, had already served the Palatinate as a chamber councilor. From 1684 he carried out this activity, but was soon hostile and slandered. Through the mediation of Emperor Leopold he became Bishop of Tinin and Provost of Ardagger and Wroclaw.
On 11 July 1706, he was appointed Prince-Bishop of Vienna by Joseph I, the Papal confirmation taking place on 4 October.
He was concerned with pastoral care and was able to increase priesthood. In 1708 there were 111 priestly ordinations in the small Viennese diocese. He introduced the celebration of the Rosary and in 1711 had the Pummerin Bell poured from cannonballs captured during the Second Turkish Siege. He also mediated between the Emperor and Pope Clement XI when in 1708 Austrian troops occupied territories of the Papal States during the War of Spanish Succession.
Towards the end of his life he was seriously ill and could only sleep while seated in a chair. At seventy-two years old he died in 1716 and was buried in the episcopal tomb of St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna.

Leo Guthart

Leo Guthart is an American economist and businessman. Guthart is a former Vice Chairman of the Pittway Corporation, and co-founder of the Long Island Research Institute, Topspin Partners, and the Long Island Venture Fund.
Education.
Leo Guthart graduated from Harvard College with a BA degree in Physics in 1958. He later attended Harvard Business School, where he received both an MBA in 1960 and later a Doctorate in Business Administration. As a writer, his work has appeared in textbooks, including "Financial Management; Cases and Readings" by Pearson Hunt and Victor Andrews.
Career.
Leo Guthart’s research as a doctoral candidate at Harvard Business School found that companies were repurchasing larger amounts of their own stock than had generally been realized, determining that these purchases had become a previously underappreciated factor in the stock market, tracking the trend from 1954 to 1963. He also wrote in 1965 that the practice would become more widespread. 
Guthart joined ADEMCO in 1963, which grew to the world’s largest manufacturer of security and alarm devices by 1992, under the leadership of Guthart. He then served as Vice Chairman of Pittway Corporation and Chief Executive Officer of its Security Group of Companies, including ADEMCO, until its sale to Honeywell in 2000. Simon Hakim and Erwin Blackstone wrote of Guthart’s role that ADEMCO’s “success” over the years, “can be attributed to Leo Guthart, [his] innovative behavior and willingness to take risks”. 
Guthart has also worked with technology transfer, focusing on commercializing the scientific work of research organizations. He also co-founded the Long Island Research Institute, alongside the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, North Shore University Hospital, and Stony Brook University. In 1993 Guthart co-founded the Long Island Venture Fund with James Simons, and in 2000 he and Simons formed Topspin Partners, LP. Guthart is currently Vice Chairman of Accelerate Long Island. 
Guthart has also served as the Chairman of the Cylink Corporation.

Charles-René de Bombelles

Charles-René de Bombelles (November 6, 1784 – May 30, 1856) was a French officer in the Austrian army, who, in 1834, entered in a morganatic marriage with Marie-Louise of Austria, the Duchess of Parma, former Empress of France, and the second wife of Napoleon, after serving as her chamberlain. He was her third husband, and she was his second wife, and their marriage was her second morganatic marriage. Later in his life (after the death of his older brother, Louis Philippe de Bombelles), he became the Count of Bombelles.
Early life.
Charles-René de Bombelles was born in Versailles on November 6, 1784, and was the third child and third son of Marc Marie, Marquis de Bombelles and Marie-Angélique de Mackau, as well as the grandson of Henri François de Bombelles. He was either one of seven children- six of whom who survived to adulthood, or one of four children, all of whom survived to adulthood. Among his siblings were Louis Phillipe (the Count of Bombelles, chamberlain to the Emperor of Austria and Austrian ambassador to Denmark), Henri François de Bombelles (tutor of Francis-Joseph, Emperor of Austria), Caroline Antoinette de Bombelles (lady of honor to the Duchess of Berry and wife of François de Biaudos de Casteja).
As he was born to a noble family in Versailles, he was forced to flee to Austria during the French Revolution (presumably around the beginning of the Revolution, approximately 1789) and joined "the Austrian Mittrowsky regiment as ensign." In 1804, after some time in the military, he assumed the title of captain. Presumably, he went onto fight in the Napoleonic Wars. In 1814, after the defeat of Napoleon, he returned to Paris, France to serve as aide-de-camp to Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, who was "the commander-in-chief of the coalition armies." Charles remained in Paris, serving as the Prince's aide-de-camp until he became a lieutenant of infantry.
In 1814, soon after returning to France, Charles married Caroline Sabine Victoire de Poulhariez de Saint André de Foucaud. Together they had two children- a son named Louis (Louis de Bombelles, born 1817) and a daughter named Marie (Marie de Bombelles, born 1819). Soon after, Charles was widowed. It is unclear when exactly Caroline died (some sources place her death in 1834), but primary sources suggest that she died in Vienna in 1819, leaving her husband a widower with two children. 
Marriage to Marie Louise.
After Marie Louise, the Duchess of Parma and widow of Napoleon, lost her second husband (and grand chamberlain), Adam Albert von Neipperg, in 1829, Prince Metternich (a German prince and diplomat who initially introduced and encouraged the marriage Napoleon and Marie several years before hand), suggested that Charles become the new grand chamberlain of Marie Louise. Charles initially declined this offer, but after some consideration, relented, and, "at 48 years of age," Charles left for Parma and became the grand chamberlain of Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma. 
He was reportedly an extremely scrupulous chamberlain. "He came," wrote a Mr. Challiot, the steward of Marie-Louise, "into a country distracted by feuds and indignant at the strong measures which it had been necessary to take in order to sweep away the former abuses... By degrees he [Charles] filled up the court appointments, which had become vacant--appointing persons who had earned the respect of the public. The accounts were kept with severe regularity. A budget drawn up every year assigned to each department and amount which was never exceeded; on the contrary there was very often a surplus. As far as was possible, everything supplied to the court, and all works required for the Ducal residence, were issued for tender and open to competition. Each department was minutely organized, all expenses were settled and paid once a month. A balance sheet showing receipts and expenditure was drawn up yearly, and submitted for audit to the Treasury of the Duchies, before being presented to her Majesty."
After working as her grand chamberlain for some time, Marie Louise, who had grown quite close to him over his stay in her household, proposed marriage to Charles, and on February 17, 1834, Charles and Marie-Louise were secretly married. The marriage was a morganatic one. Marie Louise was a duchess, and he a lesser noble and military officer with no clear title aside from Captain (and, later, Count). Upon their marriage, he assumed the title of Minister of Defense.
Not much is known about their marriage, though they seemed to be happy and affectionate towards each other. Marie Louise and Charles remained married until her death on December 17, 1847. They had no children, and he stayed by her side over the course of the few days that she was on her deathbed. In her will, she left her stepdaughter and his daughter, Marie, "the ivory crucifix which hung from the curtains of her bed, and which would receive her last breath" and publicly declared their marriage to one another. Along with this, she also left him "the sum of 300,000 Italian livres, in Milanese bonds," as well as her portrait by François Gérard, all of her books, and her manuscripts.
Later life.
Soon after Marie Louise's death, Charles returned to Vienna, Austria where he served in the court of Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria. After serving in Emperor Ferdinand's court, he returned to France where he died in Versailles aged 71.

Jared DePasquale

Jared DePasquale (born June 1, 1971) is an American film, television, and audio drama composer. He resides in Nashville, Tennessee.
Education and early career.
Born in Manhasset, New York, DePasquale earned a bachelor of music in guitar performance with an emphasis in composition from Duquesne University. Upon graduation, DePasquale chose to accept an apprenticeship opportunity with Emmy-Award winning composer Joseph LoDuca rather than continuing his education at the University of Southern California's Film Scoring Department where he had been accepted. During his tenure with LoDuca, DePasquale learned the business of writing music to picture and working with live orchestras on projects that included , , and the short lived, but critically acclaimed CBS show, American Gothic.
Composition career.
DePasquale's first full-length feature film was Full Moon Features' "Witchouse", directed by David DeCoteau, and released in 1999. "Witchouse" was the first of a series of films DePasquale would go on to score for DeCoteau, including "" and "The Frightening". Rue Morgue, Fangoria, and Cinescape positively reviewed DePasquale's scores for their innovation and high quality.
In 2000, DePasquale began working with Dave Arnold and Paul McCusker of Focus on the Family and scored a series of audio dramas adaptations, including The Secret Garden, Les Miserables, Little Women, At the Back of the North Wind, and The Hiding Place as well as several episodes of Adventures in Odyssey. In 2006, "At the Back of the North Wind" won an Audie Award through the Audio Publishers Association for "Achievement in Production," which includes the music score, sound design, and sound mix.
In a 2003 interview with Cinescape Magazine, DePasquale discussed his transition away from the horror genre by saying, "I love the challenges that each style of music brings, and I love to solve those challenges. About a year ago, however, I made a choice to not take projects that don't somehow bring something positive into our world. That doesn't rule out horror films altogether, but it does rule out many of them."
In 2004, DePasquale was featured in Music from the Movies as one of the three most promising and interesting talents among film composers today.
DePasquale's work with Arnold and McCusker has also included a series of audio dramas produced by the Augustine Institute and its AIR Theatre, including "Brother Francis: The Barefoot Saint of Asisi", "The Trials of Saint Patrick", and O"de to Saint Cecilia". The score for "Brother Francis" won "Best Score for an Audio Drama" through Audio Theatre Central and both "Brother Francis" and "The Trials of Saint Patrick" was selected as finalists for the 2018 Audie Awards "Audio Drama of the Year" by the Audio Publishers Association.
Awards.
DePasquale is the recipient of multiple honors and awards. He is the only person, regardless of award category, to have won three consecutive Seneca Awards.

Nixon-Skinner Conservation Park

 
Nixon-Skinner Conservation Park (formerly the Nixon-Skinner National Park Reserve) is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Myponga about south of the state capital of Adelaide and about south-west of the town of Myponga.
The conservation park consists of land in section 245 in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Myponga and which is bounded in the south by the Main South Road and to the east by the Myponga Reservoir.
The conservation park began in 1948 as a gift of “20 acres of scrub land at Myponga for use as a natural history reserve” by Mrs. Lucy Page to the Field Naturalists Section of the Royal Society of South Australia and was named as the "Nixon Skinner sanctuary" in memory of her two grandfathers. On 1 January 1956, ownership of land was transferred to the Government of South Australia. On 9 November 1967, it was proclaimed under the "National Parks Act 1966" as the "Nixon-Skinner National Parks Reserve". On 27 April 1972, it was reconstituted as the " Nixon-Skinner Conservation Park" upon the proclamation of the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972". On 24 February 1980, a plaque was unveiled by David Wotton, the then Environment Minister for South Australia, in the presence of Mrs Page's three surviving daughters to commemorate the donation of the land. As of 2016, it covered an area of .
In 1980, it was described as follows:…Nixon-Skinner Conservation Park supports a stringybark open forest ("Eucalyptus obliqua") in the north and central parts and a woodland of "E. leucoxylon" in the south. "E. fasciculosa" is a smaller tree scattered through the Park. A mid-dense under-storey includes a variety of sclerophyllous shrubs. Introduced grasses and some pest plants (eg "Watsonia" sp.) have become established in the south-western corner of the Park. "Schoenus tenuissimus" which is a rare plant in South Australia … occupies damp sites in the park, which is visited by the spectacular "Calyptorhynchus funereus" (yellow-tailed black cockatoo).
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

Casefile

Casefile True Crime Podcast, or simply Casefile, is an Australian crime podcast that first aired in January 2016 and is hosted by an Australian man who remains anonymous. The podcast is released on a Sunday (EST) for three consecutive weeks, with a break on the fourth week. The series deals with solved or cold criminal cases, often related to well-known murders and serial crimes. Many early episodes relate to Australian cases (e.g. Port Arthur or the Snowtown murders), although notable crimes from the UK and the US are increasingly featured, and well-known cases from other countries have also been included. Unlike a number of similar podcasts, the series is scripted and narrative, relying primarily on original police or mass-media documents, eyewitness accounts, and interview or public announcement recordings. Larger and more-complex cases have received multiple-week serialised broadcasts, and case updates to previously aired cases are also provided from time to time. The series has been well received, and has won a number of awards since its debut.
Production.
"Casefile" first aired on 9 January 2016 and was conceived by an anonymous Australian host who started producing the show in 2015 in his spare room. The host had just had surgery and was listening to a lot of podcasts and true-crime shows (e.g. "The Joe Rogan Experience", "Hardcore History", "Serial", and "Making A Murderer)" at the time, and felt encouraged by Joe Rogan to make his own based on in-depth research and a storytelling style. According to one source, the host remains anonymous because "he wants the stories, facts, and questions to speak for themselves" and "It makes the show about the stories and that's it." According to another review, the podcast's:deliberately sparse production value became its strongest asset, plunging listeners into a pool of ambient silence with a host neither named nor contextualized. ... the podcast does not go the typical route of parading listeners through a montage of primary source material like evening news reports or interviews with now-wizened investigators; instead, the stories are unfolded slowly and methodically by the anonymous host, with just enough editorializing to make it feel like a friend or a witness is relaying the tale.
In its current format, the 2021 "Casefile" team consists of the host/narrator, two composers, a creative director, a digital media/designer, and four researcher/writers. It has also had a producer, Mike Migas, “since about episode 7”, which led to the first six episodes being reworked. Researchers have also travelled internationally to access primary resources in some cases, such as former researcher and co-writer Anna Priestland, who travelled from Melbourne to visit the UK National Archives in Kew in 2017 to examine police files on Myra Hindley. A number of the more recent international cases have also been written and researched by the Australian author Eileen Ormsby.
Each case includes a corresponding page on the podcast's official homepage, which details information such as special thank yous, official support phone numbers and websites (for Australia, the UK, the US, Canada and New Zealand), other credits, and resources (such as books, websites, videos, documents, articles, maps, wanted posters, and suspect sketches), as in this example. Warnings are regularly given at the start of podcasts due to the graphic content. It is available via numerous sites.
One episode, Case 55 (Simone Strobel, released 15 July 2017), has been removed due to legal issues, although general details of the podcast itself are still publicly available. Others (Cases 19 (Snowtown) and 30 (The Claremont Serial Killer), both from 2016) have been temporarily removed with the intention of updating and/or improving them.
Reception.
Along with the recent rise in true crime podcasting, as seen in Serial or S-Town, the series has been reviewed positively by several sources:
"Rolling Stone" (22 July 2016):As "Casefile" points out in their tagline, fact is scarier than fiction. But what the podcast might really prove is that fact is "even scarier" when told in a thick Australian accent – especially when accompanied by ambient, pulsing noise from a trio of professional sound designers and musicians. In each weekly episode, which can run anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and a half, the narrator... calmly tells a story of a devastating Australian crime. The podcast expertly covers murder and abduction, sometimes walking the listener through the criminal's trial, and other times discussing potential theories for a crime whose perpetrator was never caught."Evening Standard" (28 March 2017):
The Australian-made show, which launched in January last year, has regularly featured in the UK’s top 10 podcasts on iTunes in recent months. It also regularly reaches the top 50 in the US chart, rising as high as fourth last July. ... Its mini-series on Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe received 5.8 million downloads — the most for a single case since the launch. Its most popular single episode was on British tourist Peter Falconio ... [which] has more than 4.2 million downloads. A series covering the Moors Murders ... had more than a million downloads in four days.
By episode 99, the show was appearing "in the podcast charts in 107 different countries". Download statistics by iTunesChart.net state that "Casefile" has charted in the top 100 in 5 regions, with peak ranking positions of the podcast including: Australia (2), Canada (11), Germany (68), United Kingdom (11), and United States (7). In Australia, the podcast has consistently been in the top 10 since May 2016. Overall, as of July 2019, individual episodes have been downloaded more than 275 million times.

"From the Files".
Early in the show's history, updates to cases were occasionally aired as breakthroughs or other significant events occurred. However, as the podcast evolved, these began to be placed behind a voluntary subscription paywall. In July 2019, it was announced that these updates would now be spun out into an "informal companion" series, "From the Files", to be aired monthly in the show's off week. To replace it, a new patron only show called "Behind the Files" debuted the same month. It was announced in December 2019, however, that "From the Files" would be put on hiatus for 2020.

Dykes Sorensen House

The Dykes Sorensen House, at 2nd East St. in Ephraim, Utah, is a pair-house built around 1865–1875. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.
The house was deemed "architecturally significant as an example of Scandinavian folk building design in Utah." It is a one-story adobe house which is a modified version of a pair-house (usually three rooms wide). Its plan and its facade's fenestration is consistent with the pair-house style, although this was only built two rooms wide; perhaps Sorensen had intended to complete it out as a full pair-house later. It is termed a "Type IV" pair-house, and has an indented porch in what would be its center section (if the third room was added to the south end).
Dykes Sorensen was a Danish farmer about whom not much is known; he obtained the deed for this property in 1871.
It is located at 302 S. 200 East in Ephraim. It faces east, and its property is located on the southwest corner of E. 300 South and S. 200 East.&lt;ref&gt;Google Streetview, imagery capture date August 2008, accessed November 7, 2019.

The Birth of Saint John the Baptist (Artemisia Gentileschi)

The Birth of Saint John the Baptist, by Artemisia Gentileschi, was part of a six-painting portrayal of Saint John's life, with four of the paintings by Massimo Stanzione and one (now lost) by Paolo Finoglia, for the Hermitage of San Juan Bautista (Saint John the Baptist) on the grounds of Buen Rierto in Madrid, under orders from the Viceroy of Naples, the Conde de Monterrey. Although a date has not been agreed upon by scholars, Artemesia most likely painted "The Birth of Saint John the Baptist" between 1633 and 1635. It is one of the most renowned works from Artemisia's Naples period, especially due to its detailed rendering of fabrics and floor tiles.
The painting depicts a Bible story from Luke 1:5-80, in which Zacharias and his wife, Elizabeth, are too old to have children. One day the angel Gabriel appears to tell Zacharias that he and Elizabeth will have a son named John. Zacharias is literally dumbfounded and loses his ability to speak. Later, the baby is born and all the couple's neighbors and midwives insist that the baby should be named Zacharias, after his father. Elizabeth disagrees, so they ask for Zacharias's opinion. He writes on a tablet “His name is John” and regains his ability to speak. Thus Saint John the Baptist begins his miraculous life.
Before moving to Naples, Artemisia was known for arguably pre-feminist, secular works; but in Naples she began painting a great number of commissions for Spanish rulers and churches, so her subject matter became more religious. The composition of this painting, which emphasizes female neighbors and maidservants rather than the miracle of the story, is distinctly secular. The style of this painting, though specific to Artemisia, is heavily influenced by Caravaggio, Simon Vouet, and Massimo Stanzione. The painting is now on display at the Prado Museum in Madrid.

HMS Acteon (1805)

HMS "Acteon (or "Actaeon"), was the brig Actéon", launched in France in 1804 as the second of the two-ship "Lynx"-class. The British Royal Navy captured her in 1805 but laid her up. The Navy finally commissioned her in 1809. She was at the British invasion of Île de France and later served in the Channel, the North Sea, the Baltic, and the Chesapeake. She was broken up in 1816.
French service and capture.
She was built to plans by Pierre-Jacques-Nicolas Rolland and commissioned on 14 June 1804. She was stationed in Île-d'Aix Roads. 
On 11 January 1805, she departed Rochefort under Lieutenant Depoge to join up with Admiral Missiessy's squadron, bound for the Caribbean. She returned to Rochefort on 20 May. 
French records state that she was captured off the Gironde, on 27 September, or on 11 Vendémiaire An 14 (3 October 1805), by .
British records state that on 2 October 1805 captured the French brig-sloop "Actéon", under "Capitaine de frégate" Depoge, off Rochefort. She was armed with sixteen 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 126 men. "Actéon" had on board a colonel and some recruits, as well as arms and clothing for a regiment in the West Indies. The navy took "Actéon" into service as HMS "Acteon".
British service.
After "Actéon" arrived at Portsmouth the navy laid her up in ordinary.
In February 1809 Commander Ralph Viscount Neville commissioned her at Portsmouth. Between June and September "Acteon" underwent a Very Small Repair. 
, under the command of Commander Phillip Browne, was off the Scilly Isles on 6 November, when she sighted a brig ("Acteon") chasing a lugger. "Plover" joined in, with joining later. After a chase of almost four hours, "Plover" came alongside the lugger, which surrendered. The lugger proved to be the French privateer "Lézard", of Saint Malo. She was pierced for 14 guns, but had none aboard when captured. She and her crew of 57 men had sailed from Île de Batz the night before but had not made any capture. Browne credited "Acteon" and "Orestes" with having blocked "Lézard"s escape. Lastly, Browne further reported that the three British men-of-war had recaptured the English ship "Weymouth", from Gibraltar, shortly before she could reach Aber Wrac'h. "Weymouth", Llewellyn, master, had been captured on 4 November at . After her recapture she arrived at Scilly where she described her captor as having had six guns and a crew of 63 men.
In February 1810 there occurred an unfortunate incident of friendly fire. As the packet "Princess Elizabeth", Kidd, master, was sailing to Lisbon she encountered a naval brig and an engagement developed that lasted about two-and-a-half hours. Eventually Kidd decided that further resistance was useless and ceased firing. When the boarding party from the brig arrived at "Princess Elizabeth" both sides realized the mistake. The brig was "Acteon". Kidd had prepared the mails for jettisoning but had not yet given the order that it be thrown overboard when it became clear that the brig was English. Fortunately, there were no casualties aboard the packet and no loss of mail. Kidd believed that it was possible that there were wounded aboard "Acteon". "Princess Elizabeth" arrived at Lisbon on 28 February and was due to sail back to London on 4 March.
On 23 May the French ship "Susan and Sarah" arrived at Plymouth from Île de France. She and her "very valuable Cargo" were a prize to "Acteon".
On 15 July Nivelle sailed "Acteon" for the Cape of Good Hope. By 21 November she was off the island of Rodrigues preparing for a joint naval and military expedition to take Île de France. The invasion fleet, under Admiral Albemarle Bertie, arrived at Île de France on the 28th; the capitulation was signed on the 3 December. 
After the capture of the island Neville received promotion to post captain and transferred to take command of . Admiral Bertie appointed his nephew, Bertie Cornelius Cator, to command of "Acteon.
Earlier Lieutenant Bertie Cator had been appointed to command the transport "Bombay ". He moved from temporary command of and by some accounts commanded "Anna" during the invasion. (The navy had temporarily engaged four transports as hired armed ships and put naval officers in charge of each. 
Bertie sent Cator and "Acteon" to England with duplicate dispatches announcing the successful end to the campaign.
In February 1811 the French privateer captured the American vessel "Sally", Webber, master, as "Sally" was sailing from Charleston to Liverpool. "Acteon" recaptured "Sally", which arrived at Plymouth on 13 February.
That same day Cator arrived at the Admiralty; it turned out that he was the first with the good news. The Admiralty awarded him a gratuity of £500 pounds for his good news.
"Acteon"s next mission was to carry a single letter to Calcutta and return with an answer. The sickly state of her crew meant that she often spent weeks sitting with the result that the voyage took 10 months.
"Acteon" then cruised off Cherbourg and the Norwegian coast. On 24 January 1813 "Minerva", Patterson, master, and "Christiansand", Sinus, master, arrived at Hull. They were prizes to "Acteon", which detained "Minerva" as "Minerva" was sailing from Gothenburg to Boston. At some point "Acteon" escorted the Russian fleet from the Baltic to Gothenburg. She was then caught up in severe winter gales on the Norwegian coast and sustained some damage that required her to put into Sheerness for repairs. 
Later in 1813 "Acteon" sailed to North America. On 22 September she landed marines at Lynhaven Bay by Hampton Roads. There, after a short action with American dragoons and infantry, the marines destroyed a barracks and its military stores, captured nine American soldiers, and killed and wounded several others. British casualties were one marine severely wounded.
During the very severe winter of 1813 "Acteon" provided watering parties for the British squadron blockading the Chesapeake. She also assisted in the capture and destruction of numerous coasting vessels.
Between 22 and 28 November she joined forces with to destroy two schooners and a sloop and capture three schooners and two sloops. All these vessels were coasters. The first was the "New York", of 28 tons and four men. Then came the "Phoebe", of 48 tons and five men. Next came the sloop "Caroline", of 45 tons and five men. The fourth was the schooner "Fredricksburgh", of 38 tons and two men. The fifth and sixth were the sloop "Polly" and the schooner "Peggy", both of which the British burnt. The seventh was the schooner "Lucy and Sally", of 48 tons and four men, sailing from Fredericksburgh to Onnacohe. The last was the schooner "Poor Jack", of 26 tons and three men, also sailing from Fredericksburgh to Onnacohe.
In December, "Acteon", again working with "Sophie", destroyed or captured seven small prizes. On 11 December the burnt a schooner of 37 tons. The next day they captured the 76-ton schooner "Erie" and its crew of nine men. ("Erie", under the command of John Hearn, had been sailing from Havana to Baltimore with a cargo of sugar and coffee. The British unloaded the cargo and afterwards sent it to Bermuda, thereafter employing "Erie" as a tender to the British squadron in the Chesapeake. There "Erie" too captured several prizes.) On 12 December, "Sophie" and "Acteon" burnt two small schooners, one of 25 and one of 60 tons. Then on the 16th they burnt "Little Elenea", of 59 tons and two men, sailing from Charleston to Baltimore. On the same day they also burnt a 69-ton sloop.
Lastly, on 23 December "Acteon" and "Sophie" captured two vessels of 240 tons (bm). "George" and "Betsey" were both sailing from Baltimore to Lisbon.
"Acteon" returned to Norwegian waters in 1814. On 7 June Cator received promotion to post captain. Commander John Ross (later an Arctic explorer), replaced Cator in command of "Acteon".
"Acteon" was part of a squadron of five vessels that detained "Panther", Gegollae (or Gezoline), master, which was sailing from Martinique to Dunkirk. "Panther" arrived at Plymouth on 26 June 1815.
Fate.
The principal officers and commissioners of His Majesty's Navy offered the brig "Acteon", of 353 tons, for sale at Portsmouth on 11 January 1816. "Acteon" failed to sell on several sale dates. She was surveyed with the result that on 16 October the surveyors found that she was so decayed that she was no longer seaworthy. She was then broken up.

Andrew Barentsen House

The Andrew Barentsen House, located at 195 W. 200 South in Fountain Green in Sanpete County, Utah, was built in 1874. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
It is a one-and-a-half-story brick house with a three-room pair-house plan. It has paired internal chimneys which have decorative corbelling on the ridge of the house's roof. Its windows have smooth stone pediments. A stone over the front door indicates "1874". It has a one-story rear extension which seems to be original.
Andrew Marcus Barentsen, born in 1833 in Bovsthoue, Ribe, Grimstrup Parish, Denmark, joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the 1850s and immigrated to Utah in 1863. He was a farmer and cattleman, and had two wives: Gertrude H. Ericksen who lived in this brick house with him, and Petrea Jorgensen who lived in a small frame house on the property.
The house had been used for hay storage in the 1970s, and in 1981 it was vacant and was in deteriorated condition.
The house still existed, and appeared vacant, in 2007, at the southeast corner of W. 200 S. St. and S. 200 W. St. in Fountain Green. It no longer appears to exist at that location in 2018.

Concert Interruptus

"Concert Interruptus" is the 13th episode of season 1 of "Gilmore Girls". The episode premiered on February 15, 2001 on The WB. It features Rory going to a The Bangles concert with Paris, Madeline and Louise, and beginning to make friends with Paris, while Lorelai finds out about an ex-girlfriend of Luke's after buying one of the items he donates to the town's charity sale.
Plot.
Lorelai (Lauren Graham) has volunteered to store items for the town's charity clothing sale, and as a result her house is filled with donated items. Rory (Alexis Bledel) convinces her to give up much clothing from her wardrobe, but Lorelai cannot resist buying a sweatshirt with rhinestones that someone has donated. Sookie (Melissa McCarthy) arrives with four tickets to a The Bangles concert, for herself, Lorelai, Rory and Lane (Keiko Agena).
Luke is instantly furious when he sees Lorelai wearing the sweatshirt from the charity sale, and yells at her though Lorelai does not understand what she has done wrong. She talks about it later to Sookie and Miss Patty (Liz Torres), who think that it formerly belonged to Rachel, Luke's ex-girlfriend.
Rory has been put in a team with Paris (Liza Weil), Madeline (Shelly Cole) and Louise (Teal Redmann) for a history debate, much to Paris and Rory's annoyance. Tristan (Chad Michael Murray) flirts with Paris after class, saying that he wanted to be in a team with her. As no-one else's house is free, Rory suggests that they work at her house, despite its clutter. Lane initially asks her mother (Emily Kuroda) if she can go to a play with Lorelai, Rory and Sookie, but later admits that it is a rock concert, and Mrs. Kim will not allow her to go. Seeing the girls getting along, Lorelai suggests that Rory could go to the concert with Paris, Madeline and Louise. Rory agrees, and Lorelai buys cheap tickets with Sookie.
At the concert, Lorelai keeps asking Sookie questions about Rachel, leading Sookie to question whether she is interested in Luke. Meanwhile, Madeline and Louise leave the concert to go to a party with two boys who were sitting behind them. Paris enjoys the band's music and talks with Rory about why she likes Tristan. After the concert, Lorelai is enraged to discover the girls have run off, and they find the party and drag Madeline and Louise away from it, with Lorelai shouting at them. Later, Rory tells Lorelai that Paris gave her half the debating time, a sign of friendship, and Lorelai apologises to Luke about wearing Rachel's clothing.
Analysis.
"Concert Interruptus" develops the characters of Luke and Paris, both of whom were previously "grumps with rare moments of humanity". Along with the following episode, "That Damn Donna Reed", it advances the relationship between Lorelai and Luke in a way that previous episodes did not. However, the main focus of the episode is Paris' growth; Paris was previously only seen as a bully, with the exception of her storyline in "Paris is Burning". This episode is part of the development that leads Rory and Paris to become friends. We also see the relationship between Paris, Madeline and Louise in more detail: Paris is indifferent to their "borderline nuts" actions, and acts as a "worker bee" and "wet blanket" in the group's dynamic.
In "Screwball Television", the author opines that Lorelai's clothing is an "extension of self". After Lorelai reluctantly gives away some of her clothing, she asks "Who wants cheese?", which can be seen as her experiencing separation anxiety and trying to cope with it by eating. J.M. Suarez comments that the episode is one of many to point out that "Lorelai's always a mother first", despite seeming "hip and young". Ritch Calvin notes that in the scene where Lorelai talks to Sookie and Miss Patty about Rachel, the focus of attention is on the clothing, and its ties to emotional memory, not the conversation.
Reception.
First airing on February 15, 2001 on The WB, the episode garnered 3.6 million viewers.
David Sims of "The A.V. Club" criticizes that "it's a bit of a stretch" for Rory and Lane to be interested in The Bangles, but praises Paris' apathetic reaction to her friends as "great to watch". Listed by J.M. Suarez on "PopMatters" as one of 20 "Gilmore Girls" episodes to "Make You Excited for the Revival", "Concert Interruptus" is praised for The Bangles' performance and scenes of Rory and Paris' growing friendship.
Out of the 153 episodes of "Gilmore Girls", "Concert Interruptus" is ranked 115th by "Paste" and 140th by "Vox".

Clube da Criança

Clube da Criança () was a Brazilian children's television series in the Rede Manchete between June 6, 1983 and August 14, 1998.
The attraction was exhibited from Monday to Sunday at 5:00 p.m. and Saturdays at 4:30 p.m. by mixing jokes with the audience, drawings and toy raffles.
Background.
In 1983, the director Maurício Shermann, then hired from TV Band decided to create a new children's show for programming. Remembering all the attractions for this age group he has already created, Shermann noted that in all of them they always had a pretty girl in charge. So he decided to invite Xuxa to present the show called "TV Criança", and had a member of his team go to Rio de Janeiro to look for Model.
There was no success with the attempt. Xuxa refused and even Alda, the mother of TV hots, even went to the room of Mauricio on the station asking for explanations about the invitation, which she suspected of the director's ulterior motives.
Two months after leaving Bandeirantes, Shermann headed for the Manchete, a station where he also controlled a publishing house where Xuxa was often the cover of some publications. And again, the director tried to convince the then model to present a children's show. Surprised by the invitation, the model refused the invitation, claiming that she was following an international career as a model and the project did not interest her. Then, Mauricio talked to the player Pelé, boyfriend of Xuxa at the time, that guaranteed that she would accept the project. So the director marked the first recording of the show for two weeks later.
Development.
The TV show, It premiered on June 6, 1983 at 5 pm led by Xuxa who played games, raffles, announced cartoons and received guests. After leaving Xuxa (1983-1986) for Globo TV in 1986, the program was canceled, and was replaced by the childish TV show "Lupu Limpim Claplá Topô". He returned in October 1987, hosted by Angélica (1987-1993) (as well as Xuxa, debuting in children's programs), then only 13 years old. After the transfer of Angelica to the SBT (1993), the program was hosted by the actress Mylla Christie (1993-1994). In the same year by former Miss Patrícia Nogueira (1994-1995), but due to lack of financial resources, she left the air in 1995. After two years out of the air, the program returned being hosted by Debby Lagranha (1997-1998). With the serious crisis of the transmitter, the program left the air again and Debby transferred to the Globo TV. The program was created and directed by Maurício Sherman.
The most enduring picture of the Club (in command of Xuxa) were the toy raffles sponsored by Estrela. In it, the children sent letters to the program asking to open one of the 3 boxes numbered that Xuxa showed in the attraction. The little boy got the surprise toy that was inside the box he asked to open it. In July 1985, Xuxa created two paintings in the Children's Club that would only become famous in the "Xou da Xuxa". The first, Madame Caxuxá, which was shown only on Saturdays. In it, characterized as a gypsy, the blonde made predictions for the signs of the little ones always teaching good manners and giving tips of health and education. In the second, Vovuxa, characterized as an old lady, Xuxa told stories always with some lesson for children.

Yucho Chow

Yucho Chow (1876–1949) was a professional photographer who was Vancouver's first Chinese photographer and its most prolific. He ran a studio in Chinatown from 1906 to 1949.
Life and career.
Yucho Chow was born on 3 June 1876, in Hoy Ping (now called Kaiping), Guangdong province, China. Leaving his wife and two children behind, he arrived in Canada in February 1902, with the requirement of paying the $100 head tax. It is rumoured that he worked as a house servant while apprenticing with an unknown photographer. By 1906, he had the money to buy equipment and open up a photographic studio.
Although Chow was Chinese, he became as well a favourite photographer for other marginalized communities. He opened his doors to customers of South Asian; African; Indigenous; mixed-race and Eastern European descent. His marketing slogan, which he emblazoned on his business cards and on the signs at the front of his studio, was "Rain or Shine. Anything. Anywhere. Anytime." He often produced photographs in postcard format. Chow paid careful attention to his props and backdrops, utilizing them to convey an aura of sophistication and success for his patrons. In 1935, his studio was extensively damaged by fire, and afterwards he changed his background from European opulence to a striking Art Deco style.
Over four decades, he captured photos of people across the arc of life's journey: from newborn babies to the recently deceased (whose photographs were sent back to family in China and Europe, and served as an informal death certificate). He recorded the faces of entertainers, politicians, families, children and soldiers. Outside the studio, he chronicled the community: celebrations, graduating school children, clan events, and celebrity visits. Frequently, he also was at the local train station, photographing newly arrived European immigrants. 
Cultural researcher Naveen Gill stated, "Without him, I would say we had almost no photographs of the early South Asian community." In 1915, Chow photographed the funeral procession of the Sikh activist Mewa Singh.
In 1927, he created a composite photograph of the Hoy Ping Benevolent Association. Chow portrayed Dr. Sun Yat-Sen on one of his final visits to Vancouver. His photograph of the young tap dancer Howard Fair appeared in the "Vancouver Sun" in 1938. Later shown in the same newspaper was his 1943 image of the paratrooper Richard Keye Mar.
A number of Chow's children worked in the studio. His first assistant was his eldest daughter, Mabel Chow (1900–1940). Since the Yucho Chow Studio was open twenty four hours, Mabel worked long days and did everything from carrying the heavy tripod to developing the film. In the early years, she also was a frequent model for her father as he honed his skills on the camera.
In the 1930s, another daughter, Jessie Chow, joined the studio and was trained to hand paint photos using oils. At first she only painted in small articles like flowers and ties, but later expanded to colouring whole photographs.
Upon Chow's sudden death of chronic myocarditis in November 1949, his sons Peter and Philip Chow took over the studio and ran it until 1986. When they finally retired and closed the studio, all of the negatives, spanning almost eight decades, were discarded. Consequently, today most of Chow's work is hidden away in private family albums.
Legacy.
A life-sized image of Chow was placed in an East Pender street window in 2017.
In 2019, an month-long exhibition of 80 of his photographs was shown in Vancouver at the Chinese Canadian Museum. It took the curator, Catherine Clement, over eight years to find Chow's photographs which she uncovered one photo at a time, one family at a time. 
A 344-page book of his photographs was published in 2019. "Chinatown Through a Wide Lens: The Hidden Photographs of Yucho Chow" showcases a wide range of these private photographs of diverse communities that were taken by him. 
Artifacts from his Vancouver studios, including some portraits, are housed in the permanent collection of the Museum of Vancouver.

Agahozo Shalom Youth Village

Agahozo Shalom Youth Village (ASYV) is a home for orphans of the genocide and AIDs in Rwanda. It was originally set up to educate the orphans of the 1994 genocide against Tutsi.
History.
The village was founded by Anne Heyman, who died on 31 January 2014. Heyman and her husband, Seth Merrin raised $12 million in order to start the organisation. The couple started the organisation to offer a safe community and high school education for the orphans who were at risk. The ASYV was modeled after the Israeli youth villages that were built for Jewish orphans after the Holocaust. The first group of students were 125 in December 2008. By 2012 there were 375 students from ages 15 – 21. As of 2017, there are around 500 students from Rwanda.
Overview.
The village provides students a campus with a dining room, high school, health care clinic, homes, workshop spaces, plumbing, internet service, etc. The students study biology, history, math, economics, language, literature, agriculture, music, mechanization, etc. As the educators decided that the Entrepreneurship Course by the Government was theoretical, the ASYV partnered with the Mastercard Foundation and TechnoServ for the STRYDE (Strengthening Rural Youth Development through Enterprise) project for the Entrepreneurship Club. Seth Merrin's company, Liquidnet Holdings, has invested staff time and resources at the village, and $2 million for building the village. The $23 million solar panel project is built in Rwanda on the land owned by the Agahozo Shalom Youth Village.
Process.
The leaders of the Rwanda districts gives Agahozo - Shalom a list of those teenagers who are in need of attending school. The organisation narrows down the list to 200 and visits the students to decide if the village would be a good fit. The organisation is maintained by a structure based on family. "Families" of students in every grade is split up by gender and they receive a "Mama", a Rwandan educator who lives in the house with them, a "big brother" or "big sister", a guidance counselor who visits weekly, and a foreign "cousin" volunteer who stays for a year. The staffs are referred to as "aunts' or "uncles". The students begin with the Year of Enrichment so that every students have a similar academic base.

2018 UMBC vs. Virginia men's basketball game

On March 16, 2018, during the first round of the 2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, the University of Virginia (Virginia; also UVA) Cavaliers played a college basketball game against the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) Retrievers at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Cavaliers, who were seeded first in the South regional bracket and first overall in the NCAA Tournament, faced the Retrievers, who were seeded 16th in the South regional bracket. Virginia and UMBC competed for the right to face ninth-seeded Kansas State, which had already won their first-round game against Creighton earlier in the day.
The Retrievers defeated the Cavaliers 74–54, becoming the first No. 16 seed to defeat a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. It was only the second time in college basketball overall, after No. 16 seeded Harvard defeated overall No. 1 Stanford in the women's tournament twenty years earlier. UMBC also earned its first NCAA Tournament win in school history. With Virginia set as a 20.5 point favorite heading into the game, UMBC's victory was the second-biggest upset in terms of point spread in NCAA Tournament history behind Norfolk State's defeat of Missouri in 2012 when Missouri was a 21.5 point favorite. Virginia finished their season at 31–3 while UMBC improved to 25–10.
UMBC coach Ryan Odom grew up as a Virginia fan, the son of former UVA assistant coach Dave Odom, and recalls the experience of being in attendance to cheer on the Cavaliers as they advanced to the Final Four in 1984.
Background.
At the start of this game, NCAA Tournament No. 16 seeds were 0–135 all-time against No. 1 seeds since the tournament field expanded to 64 teams in 1985.
UMBC.
UMBC entered its 2017–18 season under second-year head coach Ryan Odom. A preseason America East Conference coaches' poll picked the Retrievers to finish third in their league, and incoming senior Jairus Lyles earned Preseason All-Conference honors. The team completed the regular season with a 24–10 record and a second-place finish in the America East. Senior guards Jairus Lyles, who averaged a team-high 20.3 points per game, and K. J. Maura were named First-Team and Third-Team All-Conference respectively, with the latter earning America East Defensive Player of the Year accolades.
On March 10, 2018, UMBC won the 2018 America East Tournament after Lyles made a three-pointer with 0.6 seconds left to defeat top-seeded Vermont in the championship game. The win handed the Retrievers an automatic NCAA Tournament berth, their second appearance ever and their first since 2008, when they suffered a 66–47 loss to Georgetown in their opening game. It also gave UMBC its 24th win of the season, tied for most in program history. Before the team's NCAA Tournament opener against Virginia, guard-forward Joe Sherburne said, "We know we can go out there and have fun and play hard, and we really don't have anything to lose, so it'll be we go out there and play loose."
Virginia.
In a rebuilding year under head coach Tony Bennett, Virginia had entered the season unranked but proceeded to win the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) regular season championship outright by four games over pre-season AP No. 1 Duke, finishing 17–1 in conference play including Bennett's first win at Cameron Indoor Stadium. They then capped an improbable ascendancy by defeating North Carolina in the ACC Tournament championship, finishing the regular season 31–2. Virginia entered the tournament seeded first overall.
Two days before the UMBC game, the Cavaliers lost their future NBA lottery pick, forward De'Andre Hunter, to a season-ending left wrist fracture. The injury led the "New York Daily News" to change their pick from Virginia winning the national championship to not advancing out of the Sweet Sixteen.
Venue.
The game was played at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. The attendance for the game was 17,943. Spectrum Center had previously hosted the tournament in 2008, 2011, and 2015.
Broadcast.
The game was televised nationally on TNT and announced by Jim Nantz, Bill Raftery, and Grant Hill, with Tracy Wolfson as their sideline reporter. The game was played after the conclusion of the Kansas State–Creighton game, which took place in the same venue. The game had 3.53 million viewers, with a 94% and 54% increase in viewership compared to the 2016 and 2017 games in the same slot.
Game summary.
The game started defensively with the first half having four separate ties. UMBC did not lead until just before the midpoint of the half, before a Virginia steal tied the game up for the second time. Virginia went on a 7–1 run over a four-minute period to hold a six-point lead late in the first half before UMBC managed to tie the game at 16–16 before the final TV timeout of the half. UMBC took the lead twice before halftime, but Virginia was able to tie the game up at both points.
Coming out of halftime, the Retrievers went on an early 7–2 run before Virginia used their first of three remaining timeouts of the game. Despite the timeout, a 6–2 run before the first TV timeout of the half gave the Retrievers an 11-point lead. Another UMBC run of 10–4 would force the Cavaliers to use a second timeout. An 11–7 run by Virginia allowed them to get within 12 points before UMBC was forced to use their timeout. Both teams would stall as only eight combined points were scored by both teams before the Retrievers' second timeout. A 5–0 run by UMBC within a minute forced Virginia to use their final timeout. Despite the break, fouls by Virginia contributed to UMBC making four free throws and scoring a layup on a missed free throw, which allowed the lead to be extended to 19 points. The final two minutes would see the Retrievers extend their lead by another point to finish the game 74–54.
The Cavaliers, who led the NCAA during the season in scoring defense at 53.4 points per game, were outscored by the Retrievers 53–33 in the final twenty minutes. The twenty point loss was the largest deficit the Cavaliers suffered their entire season. It was also the only time they allowed at least 70 points that season. UMBC's Jairus Lyles, who scored 28 points while battling through cramps late in the second half, was named the game's Most Valuable Player.

Aftermath and redemption.
Immediately after the game in an interview, Virginia coach Tony Bennett remarked, 
Bennett continued to say, 
This reaction by Bennett after the game was featured in "Inc." magazine as a lesson in emotional intelligence and leadership. After the win, Odom said, "Unbelievable — it’s really all you can say."
UMBC advanced to the Round of 32, in which they faced 9-seed Kansas State Wildcats on March 18, 2018. The game was competitive, with neither team having a lead greater than nine points throughout the game, and UMBC trailing by only three points with two minutes remaining in the game. The Wildcats won the game 50–43, thus ending UMBC's one-game Cinderella run.
The first round losses by No. 1 seed Virginia and No. 4 seed Arizona, and second round losses by No. 2 seed Cincinnati and No. 3 seed Tennessee, led to the South Region becoming the first ever to not advance any of its top four seeds to the Sweet Sixteen. Another Cinderella, No. 11 seed Loyola-Chicago, won the region by beating Kansas State 78–62, becoming the fourth 11-seed ever to advance to the Final Four.
Following the season, two members of the Retrievers staff became head coaches. Assistant coach Eric Skeeters took over the Delaware State program, while director of recruiting Griff Aldrich took over Longwood. Delaware State and Longwood met in the 2018–19 season, with the host team Longwood winning 89–73. Aldrich then led Longwood to their first ever Division I postseason appearance in the 2019 College Basketball Invitational, and was named a finalist for the Joe B. Hall Award (given for most outstanding first-year head coach), which had been won by Odom in 2017. A member of the Virginia coaching staff, Ron Sanchez, also left to become a new head coach as he took over the Charlotte 49ers in the same city the UMBC game was played in. 
In 2018–19, Virginia again led the Atlantic Coast Conference standings and attained another No. 1 seed. Virginia trailed by as many as 14 points to No. 16 seed Gardner-Webb in the first half and still trailed by 6 (36–30) at halftime, before the Cavaliers poured it on and outscored the Runnin' Bulldogs 41–14 in the first nineteen minutes of the second half. Virginia went on to win the 2019 NCAA Tournament Championship in dramatic fashion, becoming the first first-time winner of the national championship since Florida thirteen years prior. UMBC, meanwhile, lost to Vermont in the championship game of the America East conference tournament, ending their hopes for an immediate return to the tourney. In a show of sportsmanship, the official UMBC athletics Twitter account celebrated Virginia's dramatic victory over Purdue in the Elite Eight. ESPN called Virginia's 2018–19 championship run "the most redemptive season in the history of college basketball." NBC Sports called Virginia's 2018–19 NCAA title the "greatest redemption story in the history of sports." Following the championship game, veteran CBS Sports announcer Jim Nantz (who also called Virginia's upset loss to UMBC in last year's first round tournament game), called Virginia's win the "all-time turnaround title." De'Andre Hunter (who missed the UMBC game with the broken wrist) was drafted #4 as a lottery pick in the 2019 NBA Draft, as Ty Jerome and Kyle Guy also left early and were drafted as well.

Rose Marion Boylan

Rose Marion Boylan, (ca. 1875–1947) known professionally as Rose Marion, was a newspaper reporter for more than forty-six years in the St. Louis, Missouri, area.
Early life and education.
Born around 1875 in Pittsburg Hill, Illinois, she was the daughter of Michael Marion of Ireland and Marie Helene Brugiere. She was the only graduate of East St. Louis High School in 1890 and then took teacher-training courses at the University of Illinois, Washington University, Bloomington Normal School and Chicago Normal School.
Career.
She taught in high school and wrote occasionally for local newspapers until 1901, when she was hired by the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch".
She was active in women's groups and in Republican politics, being an alternate delegate to the 1920 Republican National Convention in Chicago.
She covered the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904, where "she had the advantage of speaking French, and she interviewed the envoys of foreign countries which sent exhibits and had buildings in Forest Park."
In 1905, Marion was called a "famous feature writer" after she returned from attending a convention of the Federated Women's Clubs in Paris, Missouri, where she wrote a guest column for the local newspaper, the "Paris Mercury." Among other topics she gave her opinion of President Grover Cleveland:
I detest one Grover Cleveland, and , like the rest of my sex, recoil from the coarseness and the implied brutality of his views. Women are individual human creatures and as such, like men, are entitled to all that life holds for them of beauty, goodness, knowledge and pleasurable experience.
She continued work for the "Post-Dispatch" on a part-time basis until 1913, when she went to the "Globe-Democrat." She was working for the newspaper in the East St. Louis City Hall press room, where she was stricken and taken to a hospital.
During the later part of her life she also collected news for radio station WTMV and wrote a column for the "East St. Louis Journal."
She was honored as an outstanding citizen and pioneer businesswoman at an East St. Louis community dinner on October 16, 1939.
Personal life.
At the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904 she met Robert J. Boylan, a reporter for the "St. Louis Globe-Democrat" (later city editor), and they married in 1906. He died in 1936.
A resident of East St. Louis, she had two children, Robert J. Boylan Jr., and Rose Josephine Boylan, and a sister, Josephine Marion.
She died on December 28, 1947, with the diagnosis of pneumonia. A funeral service was held at St. Elizabeth's Catholic Church.

Soon before the outbreak of World War I, Duffield returned to England. He enlisted and rose to be a captain in the Royal Warwick Regiment. He was said to have "entertained troops on a battered 80 franc French piano, which was carried in a 30 franc cart".
Between 1920 and 1922, Duffield contributed music for West End revues including "Puss! Puss!" (Vaudeville Theatre, 1921), "Pot Luck" (Vaudeville Theatre, 1921), "A to Z" (Prince of Wales Theatre, 1921) and "Snap" (Vaudeville Theatre, 1922).
He again returned to South Australia in 1922 to manage Koonoona following the death of his father. His musical comedy "Hullo Healo" was first presented in Adelaide in 1924 (as "Healo") and at the Palace Theatre in Sydney in 1927.
In the late 1920s he returned to London where he contributed to further musical revues.

Thomas Needham Furnival Wilson

Major General Thomas Needham Furnival Wilson CB DSO MC (20 March 1896 − 15 May 1961) was a British Army officer who saw service in both World War I and World War II.
Military career.
Early life and World War I.
Born in Lymington, Hampshire, England, on 20 March 1896, Thomas Wilson was educated at West Downs School and Winchester College. He then went to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from where he received a commission as a second lieutenant into the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) on 11 November 1914, and was given the service number of 8864. He saw service in the First World War on the Western Front, mainly with the 1st Battalion, KRRC, which then formed part of the 6th Brigade of the 2nd Division. During his service he was promoted to lieutenant on 14 October 1915, and captain on 22 April 1918 (with seniority backdated to 11 February 1917), was wounded in action, awarded the Military Cross in February 1917, and awarded the Distinguished Service Order and mentioned in dispatches, both in 1919.

Remaining in the army during the interwar period, Wilson served in Ireland with the 2nd Battalion, KRRC during the Anglo Irish War. He married in 1922 and attended the Staff College, Camberley, from 1928 to 1929. Among his fellow students there included several who would become general officers during the Second World War, such as Gerald Templer, John Harding, Richard McCreery, Gerard Bucknall, Charles Miller, Alexander Galloway, Alexander Cameron, Philip Gregson-Ellis, Charles Murison, Claude Nicholson, William Holmes, I.

After graduating from Camberley Wilson served briefly again with the 2nd Battalion, KRRC before being sent to the War Office, where he served as a General staff Officer Grade 3 (GSO3) from January 1931 until March 1932.
Promoted on 1 January 1932 to the brevet rank of major, and major on 27 July 1932, Wilson served for just under three years, from March 1932 to January 1935, as Commander of the Company of Gentleman Cadets at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

Flames (David Guetta and Sia song)

"Flames" is a song by French DJ and record producer David Guetta and Australian singer-songwriter Sia. The song was released on 22 March 2018 by What a Music, as the third single from Guetta's seventh studio album, "7" (2018). The duo's seventh collaboration, it was written by Sia, Guetta, Christopher Braide, Giorgio Tuinfort and Marcus van Wattum, with production handled by the latter three.
The single was a commercial success, reaching the top 5 on official charts across Europe, including France, Scotland, Switzerland and the Netherlands. It also reached the top 10 in the United Kingdom and Germany among others, was the most-played song on European radio in 2018, and earned Sia a nomination for Best Female Artist at the ARIA Music Awards of 2018.
Background.
"Flames" became the seventh collaboration between Guetta and Sia, after "Titanium", "She Wolf (Falling to Pieces)", "Wild One Two", "Bang My Head", "The Whisperer" and "Helium". In a press release, Guetta opened up about the pair's history and his excitement at the prospect of getting back in the studio with her:
Composition.
"Flames" is an electropop and house song with elements of dance music. A track with vague '80s influences, it is performed in the key of F minor with a tempo of 94 beats per minute in common time. The chorus of the song follows a progression of Cm–E–Fm–D, and Sia's vocals span from B3 to C5.
Music video.
A lyric video for "Flames" was released on 22 March 2018. It was directed by Joe Rubinstein.
The official music video for "Flames" was released on 5 April 2018 on Guetta's YouTube channel. The video emulates 1970s "wuxia" films and features three women (Lauren Mary Kim, Courtney Chen and Erin Wu) training with their martial arts master (Danny Trejo). The training includes chopping a block of wood, balancing wooden buckets, and catching a fly with chopsticks, but suddenly they are ambushed by a group of ninjas, and the master allows himself to be killed. The three are then captured and taken to the palace, where they encounter the emperor (Guetta). Then the three break free and fight all the ninjas, but the emperor defeats them by throwing fireballs. The master then reappears in ghostly form, and encourages them to fight back. Eventually, the three defeat the emperor by forcing his fire-casting hands down to his crotch hence burning him to the ground in a rather painful way, ending with the master watching them from above happily. The video was directed by Lior Molcho.
Reception.
The song was well received by music critics. Roisin O'Connor of "The Independent" said: "The track is classic Sia, starring her incredible voice and a big, emotive chorus; it's an uplifting, low-key banger that shows off the maturity Sia has brought to previous Guetta tracks, along with his talent for an infectious beat." Dean Chalkley of edm.com said: "Once again, Guetta showcases his skills in providing a massive pop-house hybrid ready to take over the radio stations all over the world, offering a perfect foundation to Sia's distinctly powerful and unique voice. With a bit slower tempo, a new pop ballad is just what one could expect from the duo." Mike Nied from Idolator called it "an inspiring anthem complete with a rousing production and another of the 'Chandelier' siren's jaw-dropping vocal lines." Brittany Spanos of "Rolling Stone" described the song as "uplifting": "On the song, Guetta goes for a less clubby sound than usual. The song is more earnest as Sia offers words of encouragement to a loved one weathering a tough time."
At the ARIA Music Awards of 2018, "Flames" earned Sia a nomination for Best Female Artist.

This is the meet where Jim Ryun set the world record in the mile, uncharacteristically leading from the gun in 3:51.1, which lasted for almost eight years. Paul Wilson also set the world record in the pole vault, that lasted over a year until runner-up Bob Seagren beat it, at altitude, at the 1968 Olympic Trials.
In Santa Barbara, Barbara Ferrell also equalled the world record in the 100 meters at 11.1 (+0.3). Her record would last until Wyomia Tyus broke it in the Olympic final, at altitude, in Mexico City.

Mon Keang School

Mon Keang School is a Chinese language school located in the Wong Benevolent Association Building at 121 East Pender Street, in the Chinatown of Vancouver, British Columbia.
History.
The school was first established on the third floor of the Wong Benevolent Association Building in 1925., providing lessons in Chinese cultural customs and language, particularly Cantonese, to Canadian-born children of Chinese descent.
By 1937, the Mon Keang School was one of ten Chinese language schools in Vancouver, with classes at these schools funded primarily by groups such as family associations, the Chinese Freemasons, and churches. Like all of the other schools at the time, the Mon Keang School only offered elementary-level language classes until after World War II, when it became the first school to provide language classes at the secondary level. Instructors at the school were mainly from China, who were only allowed to immigrate under exemptions from the Chinese Immigration Act, 1923 (now known as the Chinese Exclusion Act) in effect at the time.
Wong Kown Fow, a teacher and principal at Mon Keang School from 1936 to 1969, noted that the school officially used Cantonese to teach its students, but many of its instructors also used a mixture of both Cantonese and Toisanese.
In 2011, the school officially closed and stopped offering classes due to declining enrolment.
In 2016, the Youth Collaborative for Chinatown - 青心在唐人街, a grassroots youth group based in Vancouver's Chinatown, began organizing Saturday School, a series of place-based Cantonese language learning classes that take place in the classrooms at the Mon Keang School and through field studies and trips to various other locations in Chinatown
Building history.
The school is housed in the Wong Benevolent Association Building, located on East Pender Street, on its third floor. The building was originally constructed in 1910, but underwent several renovations over years, including some designed by Chinese-Canadian architect W.H. Chow, G. A. Southall, and later by J.A. Radford in 1921.

Thief of Baghdad (TV series)

Thief of Baghdad was an Indian fantasy adventure TV series that first aired on Zee TV between 2000–2001. The show was loosely based on the Arabian Nights story. It was originally intended to run for 48 episodes but it went off-air in June 2001 abruptly due to a conflict between the production house and Zee TV. It was directed by Vijay Pandey, who has earlier directed shows like Sword of Tipu Sultan, Great Maratha, Arth, Des Mein Nikla Hoga Chand and . It was also syndicated on sister channels Zee Next and Zee Smile and Zee Anmol.
Synopsis.
Set in the Middle East during an era of marvellous adventures and magical folk tales as narrated in the Arabian Nights, 'Thief of Baghdad' tells the story of Jafar, a ruthless warlord serving under the command of the evil genie 'Shah Jinn' and his obsession with conquering the entire world to become its undisputed king.
Shortly after invading the city of Baghdad with his army and brutally vanquishing a secret rebellion led by Mukhtar, a spiritual leader and revolutionary, Jafar is informed by Shah Jinn and his sorceress aide Badi about a prospect which can greatly assist him in achieving his seemingly overwhelming objective. Jafar must convince a princess belonging to a peaceful kingdom of fairies to marry him of her own volition in order to gain complete authority and control over the inhabitants of both realms. Immediately, he decides to interrupt the birthday celebration of the beautiful princess Yasmeen and take her away from her kingdom to imprison her in his palace full of grim spells preventing her from escaping back to her home. As the princess begins to develop feelings of despair and anguish, hope appears in the form of a notorious thief known only throughout the city as the 'Thief of Baghdad', a sly and artful hero who steals from the rich to help the poor and oppressed.
One night during an intrusion into Jafar's palace to retrieve a collection of magical items stolen from three visiting merchants, the Thief coincidentally encounters the captive princess and they both recall their romance with each other prior to the events which unfolded with the appearance of Jafar. Realising the severity of the situation and its impact on every inhabitant in both realms, the Thief decides to do whatever he can to stop the tyranny of Jafar and rescue the Princess from his vile grasp.
As the series progresses the Thief and several allies he forms relationships with all have to endure and overcome the dangerous obstacles and ghastly traps Jafar has set to secure his position as the ultimate king of kings.
"(Unfortunately, due to a dispute between the production house and Zee TV, the remaining episodes of the series were never completed or aired on television and the final resolution to the story remains unknown.)"

Joyride (Tinashe album)

Joyride is the third studio album and seventh overall project by American singer Tinashe. It was released through RCA Records on April 13, 2018. The album features guest appearances from Offset, Ty Dolla Sign, French Montana, Little Dragon, and Future. The album also features production by Stargate, Dre Moon, Hit-Boy, T-Minus, and others.
The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, most of whom praised the album's composition and themes; however, some criticized it for it not being cohesive like Tinashe's previous studio albums. The album debuted at number 58 on the US "Billboard" 200, selling 9,800 album-equivalent units, of which 4,710 came from pure sales.
The album was supported by three singles: "No Drama" featuring Offset, "Faded Love" featuring Future, and "Me So Bad" featuring French Montana and Ty Dolla Sign.
Background.
On September 2, 2015, Tinashe released a teaser for "Joyride" on YouTube. On September 9, Tinashe leaked the buzz single "Party Favors" featuring rapper Young Thug as a way to get the ball rolling on her label's part. On October 2, 2015, Tinashe released another song, "Player" featuring Chris Brown, as the first intended lead single of the album. On October 21, 2015, Tinashe was featured on British electronic duo Snakeships' track "All My Friends", which reached the top 20 in five countries. A few weeks later, on November 17, Tinashe held a breakfast listening party for "Joyride" at the Sony Club in New York City, which was attended by reporters and various other members of the music industry. At this event, she played at least one song that wound up on the final version of "Joyride": the album's closing track, "Fires and Flames." Two other songs played that day — "Fearless" and the Max Martin-produced "Prisoner" — have not been released.
After a few months without releasing any new music, Tinashe released a new intended lead single for the project, entitled "Superlove". The song was released on July 15, 2016 and the music video, directed by Hannah Lux Davis, debuted on August 12, 2016 on MTV's Snapchat to rave reviews. The video on YouTube reached one million views in just a day and a half. On September 15, 2016, with a MTV Wonderland performance, Tinashe released "Company" as the album's intended second single. However, this ended up being the first and only single off her 2016 album "Nightride". Perhaps conceived of as a holdover until "Joyride" was ready to be released, "Nightride" featured many of the songs that were supposed to be on the original version of "Joyride", including "Sacrifices", "Soul Glitch", "Ghetto Boy" and "Touch Pass" (which she initially premiered at "Joyride"'s November 2015 listening party and performed on the Joyride World Tour in early 2016). The promo singles "Ride of Your Life" and "Party Favors" (without Young Thug) were also included on "Nightride".
On March 16, 2017, Tinashe released yet another intended lead single for "Joyride", which was also initially premiered at "Joyride"'s November 2015 listening party, "Flame". In a March 30, 2018 interview, Tinashe claimed that the release of "Flame" as a lead single was her record label's idea, saying: "I wasn’t forced, but it was one of these situations where it was like 'Okay, I will trust you guys and this is what you believe is the best decision so I'm going to get behind it', because that's more advantageous than to sabotage my own songs... And when that wasn't necessarily successful, I realized that it was my turn to get back into the driver's seat as far as curating every move I made from there on out." After continuing to work on the album through the summer of 2017, Tinashe announced the release of three new singles from "Joyride" on January 12, 2018. "No Drama" featuring Offset was released as the first single on January 18, 2018, with an accompanied music video directed by Sasha Samsonova. "Faded Love" featuring Future was released the following month, on February 12. A vertical video was released via Spotify on February 16, and on YouTube three days later.
On March 16, 2018, Tinashe finally revealed the "Joyride" artwork on her Instagram and announced the album would be released on April 13, 2018. On March 30, 2018, the third single "Me So Bad", featuring Ty Dolla Sign and French Montana, was released along with a Sahsa Samsonova-directed music video. With this release came the digital pre-order for "Joyride". On April 25, 2018, a special edition of "Joyride" was released exclusively in Japan, which includes the first three original intended singles ("Player", "Superlove", and "Flame") as bonus tracks, as well as new track "L-O-V-E". The version of "Player" present on this edition features AK-69 instead of Chris Brown.
Writing and recording.
The writing and recording for the album went through several phases. In late January 2015, Tinashe was reported to be working with writers and producers from Prescription Songs (Cirkut, Ammo, Rock City, Jakob Kasher, Chloe Angelides), Max Martin and Taylor Parks on the album. After months of silence after the release of the album's then-latest lead single "Flame", Tinashe on July 11, 2017, confirmed that she was still working on her new album with producers Mike Will Made It, TM88, Metro Boomin, Diplo, Boi-1da, Charlie Handsome and others.
In an April 5, 2018 article in "Vulture", Tinashe stated: "Once I brought in producers and writers, we were in there every day being creative... We set the vibe, had Taco Tuesday parties. That was a huge turning point for me. Once that summer happened, I regained a huge sense of confidence and purpose: 'Okay, I'm doing this. I really made this happen. I’m gonna make my best music ever.' That's what we did." In this "Vulture" article, Tinashe admitted that "three [different] versions of this album exist" and that there "are probably 200 songs" total that were recorded over the course of a three-year period.
Title and packaging.
Tinashe explained to "Billboard" the meaning behind the title: "I always had it in the back of my head, but it started to become more and more relevant to my current state of my career. With all this traveling I've done this past year and everything I've gone through, it just really feels like an adventure, a journey, a ride."
The album cover art features Tinashe posing in a futuristic gown along with a spike-covered jetpack emerging from her back. The last page of the "Joyride" booklet as part of the CD features a page dedicated to her thanks, including her long-time attorney Dina LaPolt, who has previously worked with Fifth Harmony, Britney Spears, deadmau5, among others: "Thank you Dina LaPolt and Danielle Price for all you have done to finally push this project out. My fans and I are forever grateful."
Critical reception.
"Joyride" received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 66 based on thirteen reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews". 
Israel Daramola of "Spin" wrote in a positive review that the album is "a cool and sexy record," and "well-crafted and ambitious." For "Exclaim!", Ryan B. Patrick scored the album a 7 out of 10, stating that ""Joyride" is a stop-start journey that doesn't quite stall out, but does feel like some ground has been lost." Andy Kellman of AllMusic awarded the album 3.5 out of 5 stars, stating "the highlights are filled with rich details and seductive hooks", along with stating that "the songs 'Salt', and 'Fires and Flames', invalidate all the claims that Tinashe is one-dimensional." In a positive review, Zoë Madonna of "The Boston Globe" stated "the most fascinating offerings on "Joyride" are that the singer recorded herself in her home studio", and that "in these tracks, she touches something stellar." In another positive review of the album, Hannah Mylrea of "NME" gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, calling ""Joyride" brilliantly good fun", and calling the album "mainly worth the two year wait."
In a mixed review of the album, Ben Devlin of "musicOMH" gave the album 2.5 out of 5 stars, stating that "the intro and hard-edged title track create a sense of concept," however that "it is discarded for the song 'No Drama'," and that "a sense of cohesion never quite returns to the album." In another mixed review of the album, Roisin O'Connor of "The Independent" awarded the album 3 out of 5 stars, saying ""Joyride" has its shining points, and attempts to remain true to a cohesive, moodier tone," however that "it's missing the strong, catchier elements that helped Tinashe rise in the first place."
Commercial performance.
Joyride debuted at number 58 on the US "Billboard" 200 for the week of April 28, 2018, selling 9,800 album-equivalent units in its first week, of which 4,710 came from pure sales. She debuted at number 12 on the Digital Album Sales chart that same week, a chart that ranks the top 50 of pure albums sales that week. The album sales are a decrease in what was originally predicted, being originally predicted to sell 15,000–20,000 album-equivalent units, with 5,000–7,000 being pure sales. The album also reached number 29 on the US "Billboard" Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album debuted at number 55 on the Canadian Albums Chart, becoming the singer's first album to chart on the chart.
The album achieved similar success internationally, reaching number 78 on the UK Albums Chart, making it her first album to chart since 2014's "Aquarius", reaching the same peak as "Aquarius". In Australia, the album performed similarly, reaching number 76 on the ARIA Charts. On the Dutch Albums chart, the album peaked at number 103, becoming the singer's first album to chart on the chart.
Tour.
In the summer of 2015, Tinashe joined Nicki Minaj for US concerts on The Pinkprint Tour. She also joined Katy Perry in both September, and October, in the South American leg of the Prismatic World Tour.
Tinashe announced the Joyride World Tour on January 12, 2016, to support the album. Beginning in February 2016, it was scheduled through May 2016 including dates in North America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania. The tour was ultimately canceled as Tinashe wanted to focus on making new songs for the album. Tinashe also revealed another promotional single, "Ride of Your Life", on February 2, 2016.

Indonesian Army Aviation Command

The Indonesian Army Aviation Center (Indonesian: "Pusat Penerbangan Angkatan Darat") abbreviated Puspenerbad or simply Penerbad is the Army aviation unit of the Indonesian Army which has a means to support the combat mobility of the troops and also transport Infantrymen for Air assault operations. Penerbad is considered as an integral part mainly in cases of Air assault operations parallel to other Armament Corps of the Indonesian Army. Other additional tasks conducted by the unit can be implemented to support non-combat operations such as Search and rescue, Disaster relief, etc.
History.
The Indonesian army aviation was born in 1959 when the doctrine of Heliborne Troops or Air Mobile was being developed in various countries. In Sarawak, the British SAS launched an air assault operation with Westland Wessex helicopter containing 16 personnel. During the Vietnam War, the United States Army operated in the form of Air Cavalry by the 1st Cavalry Division and Sky Soldiers by the 173rd Airborne Brigade using UH-1N Huey, UH-1 Iroquois and CH-47 Chinook helicopters supported by AH-1S attack helicopter Cobra and CH-54 Flying Crane. In Algeria, the French Army conducted a similar operation earlier with the Alouette III.
When the Chief of Staff of the Army made a Decree on the establishment of the Army Aviation Detachment () on November 14, 1959 with the task of taking care of all activities concerning the field of organic army aviation, at that time "Detasemen Penerbad" did not have any aircraft at all. At that time the news was heard that Dr. A.K. Gani's DHC-2 Mk I Beaver plane which was being overhauled in Singapore will be sold, then the army immediately bought it.
As a follow up, some officers including Captain Binjamin Hadi, Captain Burhan Ali and Captain Sukartono were sent to the United States to attend an aviator training at the US Army Aviation School in Fort Rucker, Alabama in 1959 followed by a second batch in 1962 consisting of Lieutenant Colonel Juono, Captain Dolf Latumahina, Captain Sudewo, Captain Daud Natawiyoga, 1st Lt T.M.F. Worang and several other officers. It bore fruit when the Detachment later acquired two Cessna L-19 aircraft in the framework of the US Military Assistant Program in 1964, followed on by 15 Soviet-made Mil Mi-4 medium and 1 Mil Mi-6 heavy multipurpose helicopters, together with 2 American made Aero Commander 680FL utility aircraft in 1965. These purchases made Indonesia the one of the pioneer countries in Southeast Asia to have a strong army aviation force, and thus, the Detachment was transformed via Decision Kep/853/VII/1963 of the Chief of Staff of the Army on 22 July 1963 into the Army Aviation Service ("Dispenerbad"), which adopted its current name on 15 January 1966 (name readopted on 26 May 2000).
Mission.
The mission of Indonesian Army Aviation is to find, fix, and destroy the enemy through fire and maneuver; and to provide combat, combat support and combat service support in coordinated operations as an integral member of the combined arms team. On the modern battlefield, Indonesian Army Aviation, unlike the other members of the combined arms team, has the organic flexibility, versatility, and assets to fulfill a variety of maneuver, CS, CSS, roles and functions. These cover the spectrum of combined arms operations. Aviation can accomplish each of these roles—within the limits of finite assets and capabilities—during offensive or defensive operations and also for joint, combined, contingency, or special operations, as well as in civil-military operations such as disaster relief.
As a Central Executive Agency of the Army with greater importance, its Commander and Deputy Commander, filled up by officers of Major General and Brigadier General rank, respectively, are appointed and relieved from their positions by the Chief of Staff of the Army. Training is imparted to all enlistees and graduate officers assigned at the Army Aviation Corps Training school in Semarang, where they receive specialized training in helicopter warfare.
Squadrons.
Puspenerbad currently has five squadrons and one training center, which are:

Devan Ramachandran

Devan Ramachandran (born 19 March 1968) () is an Indian Judge. Presently, he is Judge of Kerala High Court. The High Court of Kerala is the highest court of Judicature for the State of Kerala and Union Territory of Lakshadweep.
Early life and education.
Devan Ramachandran completed his schooling from Bhavans Vidya Mandir, Elamakkara, Pre-degree from the Sacred Heart College, Thevara and obtained law degree from Government Law College, Ernakulam.
Career.
He started practicing as an advocate in 1991, under the guidance of his father Senior Advocate Mr. M.P.R Nair, Barrister-in-Law (Middle Temple- London). He practiced in various modern branches of law including corporate, company and constitutional matters. In recognition of his eminence, the Kerala High Court had engaged services of Sri Devan Ramachandran to be its advocate/counsel when he was just 35 years, making him the youngest one to do so till date. Justice Ramachandran also served as standing counsel for the CBSE, various Private and Public companies, various banking and financial institutions, including the Indian Banks' Association, the principal financial advisory mechanism to Reserve Bank of India.
Achievements.
He was designated as a 'Senior Advocate' by the High Court of Kerala, in 2015. Justice Devan Ramachandran and his father are credited to be the first; and until now, the only father-son duo till date to be designated as 'Senior Advocates' by the High Court of Kerala. 
The High Court of Kerala had also appointed Justice Devan, while he was a Counsel, to assist as an "Amicus Curiae (friend of court)" in a suo motu Public Interest Litigation pertaining to the illegal trafficking of children from North India to Kerala.
The Indian Express recognised Justice Devan Ramachandran as a Newsmaker in 2019 for his judgments that impacted public life.
Notable cases.
In a recent significant judgment, Justice Devan Ramachandran has declared the use of disrespectful and abusive words and vocatives by Police against citizens to be “relics of the colonial subjugatory tactics” and hence unconstitutional. The State Police Chief has now issued a circular to all officers not to use disrespectful words like “eda”, “podi” and “nee” to address citizens.He had also, in the year 2018, delivered another judgment directing the State Police Chief to ensure that the Police Force behaves as a modern, civilized and professional force
In a move to make Kerala an investor friendly destination, Justice Ramachandran has held the long continuing ill practice of Trade Unions to extort money as gawking charges(called “nokkukooli” in Malayalam) illegal.
In the recent times, the Vacation Bench of High Court of Kerala, of Justice Devan Ramachandran and Justice Kauser Edapagath took up several important issues with respect to the COVID 19 pandemic.
(a) The Court banned victory and congratulatory processions/parades of all political parties after the State Legislature election results were announced on 2/5/2021.
(b) The Court suo motu directed State Police Chief to avoid crowding of people at all Vaccination centres saying “otherwise what is intended to be a prophylactic exercise will become super spreader event”.
(c) The most important issue taken by Justice Devan was to control the COVID treatment costs in private hospitals. There are several complaints that hospitals are profiteering and exploiting patients during pandemic. The Bench, headed by Justice Devan, issued various directions to Government to control private hospitals and to regulate their treatment costs.
In 2020, a notable judgement authored by Justice Ramachandran relates to a controversial contract granted by the Government of Kerala to an American company called "Sprinklr" for processing the data of patients and persons suspected of COVID-19 in Kerala. Objections came to be raised from several quarters that this will lead to data confidentiality breach. Through an order, Justice Ramachandran, sitting with Justice Ravi, directed the Government to anonymise the entire data before it is handed over to Sprinklr for processing; further injuncting Sprinklr from committing any breach of confidentiality or dealing with the data against the terms of the confidentiality clauses in the agreement. The Columbia University Journal has hailed this order to be "extra ordinary" from the angle of data protection.
The condition of bad roads and flooding in Kochi City and other parts of Kerala has been engaging the High Court through Justice Ramachandran. He has been issuing several orders in succession with respect to this and have delivered a judgement making engineers and officers concerned accountable. On account of this the condition of roads have vastly improved. However, in the meanwhile a young person died in a pothole and Justice Ramachandran took note of it suo Motu and issued urgent directions, at the same time showing his humanistic face by apologising to the victim's family for the systemic failure that lead to the accident.
Reacting to the death of a pedestrian by electrocution from a snapped overhead line on a public street, Justice Devan initiated a suo motu case against the Electricity Board and issued directions to it to avert such in future.
Justice Ramachandran has been writing judgments on the need for protection and conservation of environment, ecology and nature. He has, sitting in Division, banned the use of plastics at the Sabarimala Hills and shrine, including in the "irumudikettu", the traditional offering carried by pilgrims. This judgment has now forced Government of Kerala to ban single-use plastics in the whole of Kerala.
Again, Justice Devan Ramachandran, reacting to the horrific damage being caused to ecology by what is commonly called the "Flex Boards" found carelessly placed all over public spaces in Kerala, ordered strict legal regulation of installation and erection of unauthorised Flex boards/ Advertisement Boards/ Bill Boards / Flags in any public space all over Kerala. This case is still pending and several further orders have been issued, under the concept of continuing mandamus, to ensure that such boards are implicitly regulated as per law. As a direct impact of these orders, the Government of Kerala has issued an order banning "Flex Boards" in the state
Expressing deep empathy with an "endosulphan victim" who got entangled in recovery proceedings consequent to default of loan availed by him to meet medical expenses of his children, Justice Devan directed the Government to write off the loan.
Further exhibiting deep humanism, Justice Devan, evolving a new principle termed "Lost Life", ordered payment as special compensation to be paid to the mother of a minor victim of a motor accident who had been reduced to a permanent vegetative state pursuant to the accident and has remained as such for the past 13 years. 
Justice Devan Ramachandran ruled, again in a first of its kind judgment, in November 2017, that a minister whilst he is holding such a position cannot file a case against one's own government or its functionaries. The judgment was rendered in case filed by Sri Thomas Chandy, an erstwhile minister in the State of Kerala. Through a separate judgment, a first and unique of its kind in Indian Legal Jurisprudence touching upon the aspects of 'Cabinet Confidentiality' and 'Cabinet Solidarity'
Through a Judgment delivered in October 2017, in "T.M. Thomas" v "State of Kerala", Justice Devan had called for mechanism ensuring active participation of victims in criminal proceedings along with the State, rather than being a mere outsider to such proceedings. The Director General of Police, in compliance with the above judgment has subsequently issued a circular to honor in letter and spirit the terms of the said judgment.
Justice Devan upholding the autonomy and independence of Universities held that they are not subservient to any Government.
Describing the long human chain formation (queue) in front of liquor shops across the state as an "affront to the dignity of citizenry and loss of self respect", Justice Ramachandran, issued various directions to the State Excise Department to do away with such a practice with consideration for self respect and upholding humanitarian values 
In a batch of writ petitions concerning the illegal encroachments and damages caused to lakes and biodiversity, Stressing on the Constitutional obligation of every citizen under Articles 49 and 51A he opined that "Conservation of biodiversity is vital to response to climate change and in the delivery of key ecosystem services like food, flood management, pollination, clean air and water.
In a judgment delivered in 2016, Justice Devan Ramachandran, expressed deep anguish and concern over the deteriorating status of Legal education across the country. Justice Devan, who penned the judgment sitting in Division Bench, directed that the legal education imparted across the country should be done with a trajectory (vision) towards the future.

A member of the Democratic Party and former undocumented immigrant (DREAMer), Cruz has worked as an advocate for immigration rights, including as Director of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's 2016 Exploited Task Force. Cruz was elected as the Democratic candidate in the Fall 2018 election for the 39th district of the New York State Assembly, representing Corona, Elmhurst, and Jackson Heights, Queens.
Early life and education.
Cruz was born in Medellín, Colombia. In 1992, when she was nine years old, Cruz and her mother came to the United States under a six month tourist visa. They remained in the U.S. and she was undocumented for over 10 years after her initial tourist visa expired. Cruz grew up in Brooklyn and Queens. She has five siblings, three of whom are U.S. citizens. Cruz became the first former undocumented immigrant who identifies as a DREAMer to be elected in New York state. (Both Adriano Espaillat and Gabriela Rosa were former undocumented immigrants who served in the New York State legislature, but neither identifies as a DREAMer.) She is also the first Colombian-American in the district, and only the third DREAMer to serve in an elected position in the United States. In 2001, Cruz graduated from John Bowne High School in Flushing, Queens. In 2005, Cruz received a bachelor's degree with honors in forensic psychology from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. In 2009, Cruz received a J.D. from the City University of New York School of Law.
Career.
After law school Cruz worked as a Volunteer Assistant Attorney General for the New York State Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo, where her case work included focusing on fraud related to immigration services and working on prosecution efforts.
From 2009 to 2012, Cruz was counsel at the Goddard Riverside SRO Law Project at the Goddard Riverside Community Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
From 2012 to 2014, Cruz was counsel to the Division of Immigrant Policies and Affairs at the New York State Department of Labor.
In 2014, Cruz was counsel to the Immigration Committee for the New York City Council, where she worked to improve coverage of issue related to domestic worker trafficking. She worked on the Unaccompanied Minors Initiative and the IDNYC program. She also oversaw the Key to the City program. She was in this position until 2015.
From 2015 to 2017, Cruz was the Director of the Office of the New York State Governor, Andrew Cuomo. During this time she was the Special Assistant for Labor &amp; Workforce. She was also the Director of the Joint Task Force on Worker Exploitation and Employee Misclassification, also known as the Exploited Workers Task Force, a working as assistant counsel in Cuomo's taskforce.
In 2017, Cruz became Chief of Staff for New York City Council Member, Julissa Ferreras-Copeland until Ferreras-Copeland made the decision not to seek re-election.
New York Assembly.
In February 2018, Cruz announced her candidacy for Francisco Moya's vacated position on the New York State Assembly's Assembly District 39. The District's Democratic leadership instead unanimously selected Ari Espinal as the Democratic candidate in the April 2018 special election.
Cruz then won the Democratic primary for District 39 on September 13, 2018, over Espinal, and won the seat on November 6, 2018. She had received campaign training from New American Leaders that she believes helped her ultimately fundraise nearly $200,000 to win the primary race.
Personal life.
Cruz identifies as a DREAMer under the unadopted DREAM Act that was introduced in 2001, which addresses citizenship of children brought to the United States by their parents and living as undocumented citizens.
Cruz married her high school boyfriend in 2003, which allowed Cruz to get her green card in 2005 and become a U.S. citizen in 2009. Cruz' citizenship allowed her to sponsor her mother's citizenship. The marriage ended in divorce. Cruz is married to a New York Police Department police officer. She and her husband live in Jackson Heights, Queens.
Cruz has said that the attorney who did her immigration papers inspired her to go to law school and become a lawyer.

Eresma River

The Eresma is a river in central Spain. It flows through Castile and Leon (specifically the provinces of Segovia and Valladolid). It has a total length of 134 km and drains a basin with an area of 2940 km².
Name.
The name of the river has been derived from the Iberian "Iri-sama" which means "that which surrounds the big city". The city referred to here is not Segovia itself as sometimes thought, but rather the town of Coca located some 50 km away.
Geography.
The Eresma River starts in Valsaín valley of the Sierra de Guadarrama, where the confluence of several streams forms the river. Most of these streams descend from the slopes of mountains like Peñalara, Siete Picos and Montón de Trigo. Its most important tributaries are Moros and the Voltoya that flow northward.
After passing through San Ildefonso and Palazuelos, it reaches the city of Segovia, which it surrounds in a closed meander. Eresma river then runs northwest, passing near Hontanares, Los Huertos, Bernardos, Navas de Oro, Coca and Villeguillo. It enters the province of Valladolid through Olmedo, Pedrajas, Alcazarén and Hornillos. Later it flows from the right into the Adaja in Matapozuelos.
The Eresma River has a pluvio-nival regime, which means that it has a period of high water flow in the autumn and winter season in proportion to precipitation and a short, violent water flow in the spring when the snow melts.

Formation through "The Unit".
In July 2017, KBS announced their new survival show that would create male and female unit groups, with nine members each, among idols who had already debuted. The program aimed to give them a fair chance to demonstrate their talents that they might not have been able to showcase before. The final nine female contestants were chosen by public voting and announced via live television broadcast. It premiered on October 28, 2017 and concluded on February 10, 2018.
On February 21, 2018, it was revealed that the female group, Uni+ G, would hold their first fan-meeting on March 3 at Blue Square iMarket Hall. The tickets sold out within two hours of being on sale. On February 24's broadcast of "The Unit's Special Show", the final nine female contestants that formed “Uni+ G” became "UNI.T" following the announcement.
On April 28, 2018, it was revealed that UNI.T would make their debut on May 17, 2018. However, on May 11, their debut was pushed back to May 18, a day after their initial debut date.

Theophile Papin

Theophile (Toto) Papin (ca. 1858–1916) was a St. Louis, Missouri, real estate man known as the "squire of debutantes" because of the large number of young women who made their bow into society under his auspices. 
Papin was the son of Theophile Papin (ca. 1827–1902) of St. Louis and Julia Henry of Illinois. He had a brother, Edward V., and two sisters, Julia and Mrs. Gerald M. Borden.
Papin went to school in France and then attended St. Louis University and Washington University. He also studied in Marburg and Cassel, Germany.
Papin was noted in St. Louis Roman Catholic circles because of his friendship with high dignitaries of the church and the fact that he had been granted private audiences by Popes Leo XIII and Pius X.
He went to Vatican City in 1912 to deliver to Pope Pius the testimony taken in connection with the canonization of Rose Philippine Duchesne of the Sacred Heart Convent in St. Charles, Missouri. He booked a ticket on the SS Titanic for his return trip, but canceled at the last moment, thus avoiding the sinking of the liner when it struck an iceberg. 
The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" said of him: "Papin was regarded as one of the best-educated men in St. Louis. He was a linguist, a lover of rare books and a collector of valuable paintings.
He was also known for being recruited by society women to take care of the myriad details of their daughters' "coming out" as debutantes during St. Louis's social season.

One heart for peace

One heart for peace (in french: "Un coeur pour la paix") is a French association, created in 2005 by Muriel Haïm, to help Palestinian children suffering from heart disease and to bring Israelis and Palestinians closer with several joint actions in health care and education.
One heart for peace was born for one reason: Palestinian children who suffer from congenital malformations of the heart, need to be operated, and there is no pediatric cardiac surgery service in the West Bank or the Gaza Strip. One heart for peace was created to organize and fund a program of prevention and treatment for children.
Although peace between the two peoples has not yet been achieved, these children are the living proof of cooperation between Israeli doctors and their Palestinian colleagues in Jerusalem and the West Bank. The cooperation surprises visitors, politicians and journalists, who come to discover the program, which takes place at the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem.
One heart for peace, operates free of charge the Palestinian children who suffer serious malformations of the heart, often lethal, in the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. This is possible thanks to the cooperation of a team of Israeli and Palestinian doctors who work together.

Mary Moore (artist)

Mary Moore (born 25 June 1957) is a Western Australian artist. Her paintings are inspired by the day-to-day existence of her family, creating works that speak of optimism and confidence about life. She makes spaces that she charges with her meanings so that people who look at them can become evolved and make up their own stories.
Her work 'Big brain' was produced while she was a student in printmaking at WAIT (now Curtin University). Her approach derives from pop art, making use of puns, such as her "Gay Paris and the Eyefull Tower" from her stamp series, and incorporating throw away items to comment on contemporary culture.
In 1999 she was part of the group exhibition "Rebirth, Western Australian Women Celebrating a Century of Change" at the Moores Building and curated by Lyn DiCiero.

The main artery is Ban Khrua Nuea in Soi Kasem San 3, Rama I Road, the boundary between Ratchathewi and Pathum Wan Districts.
History.
The community dates back to the reign of King Rama I, who granted the land to Islamic Cham troops after they had fought with the Siamese Army in the "Songkhram Kao Thap", the Burmese–Siamese War in 1785–1786, the last major battle fought against Burmese invaders. The Cham had migrated from the Champa realm (currently in central and southern Vietnam) during the Ayutthaya Kingdom. Ban Khrua is the oldest Islamic community in Bangkok. 
Khlong Saen Saep was dug during the reign of King Rama III as the main supply route for troops fighting in what is now Cambodia and part of southern Vietnam in the 14 year-long Siamese-Vietnamese wars. It runs from Bangkok to the Bang Pakong River in eastern Chachoengsao Province.
Years ago, silk fabric was a well-known product of the community and a major source of income for most households. The community served as a factory for the American businessman Jim Thompson whose home, now a museum called the Jim Thompson House, is nearby on the south bank of the canal. Thai silk became highly prized, and was used as for costuming in the Broadway musical "The King and I" in 1951 and Hollywood film "Ben-Hur" in 1959. Ban Khrua became a centre of the silk industry in Thailand.
The Disappearance of Jim Thompson in 1967 marked the peak of silk production in Ban Khrua.
Three mosques remain in the community. Silk production continues in a few workshops, where traditional production methods survive. Adding to the cost of progress, Ban Khrua residents have been at odds with the government for more than 25 years as they fight to keep their community from being razed for a proposed tollway.

Homemade Christmas

Homemade Christmas is an EP by American drag queen Trixie Mattel, released on December 1, 2017.
Background and release.
Brian Michael Firkus, better known by the stage name Trixie Mattel, competed in the seventh season of "RuPaul's Drag Race" in 2015. After appearing on "Drag Race", Mattel appeared in the web series "UNHhhh" on WOWPresents with fellow season seven contestant Katya Zamolodchikova, known mononymously as Katya. The duo later went on to star in "The Trixie &amp; Katya Show", which premiered on Viceland on November 15, 2017.
Prior to "Homemade Christmas", Trixie Mattel released the country album "Two Birds" in May 2017. Katya appears on the holiday EP, which was released on December 1, 2017 via Apple Music, iTunes, and Spotify.
Composition.
"Homemade Christmas" includes three acoustic tracks of holiday music. Lyrically, "Christmas Without You" is about loneliness during the season. "The Night Before Contact" is a parody of "A Visit from St. Nicholas" (more commonly known as "'Twas the Night Before Christmas"), performed by Katya. "All I Want for Christmas Is Nudes" is a parody of Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You".
Reception.
"Instinct" David Lopez said "Christmas Without You" was reminiscent of Trixie Mattel's previous studio album. He said of "The Night Before Contact": "Personally, after hearing this, I think Katya could be the new voice of the omnipresent narrator if they ever remade "How the Grinch Stole Christmas!""

Korby Lenker

Korby Lenker is an American folk and Americana singer-songwriter as well as an author of short stories. He is known for his album "Thousand Springs" and his book of short stories, "Medium Hero." The son of a mortician and a school teacher, Lenker was born in 1976 in Twin Falls, Idaho, and now resides in Nashville, Tennessee. Lenker maintains an active touring schedule.
Career.
As a high school student in Twin Falls, Idaho, Lenker fronted the alt-rock band Clockwork Orange. In 2001, he relocated to Bellingham, Washington, where he founded the alt-bluegrass band The Barbed Wire Cutters while attending Western Washington University. The band released two albums, the self-titled "The Barbed Wire Cutters" (2002) and "Full Moon to Rise" (2003). While still touring with The Barbed Wire Cutters, Lenker began recording solo work, including the albums "First Takes" (2001), "The Ghost of Whiteboy" (2002) and "Bellingham" (2003). Lenker then moved to Seattle, Washington, to continue his solo career, before relocating to Nashville in 2007. In 2017, he released "Thousand Springs." The album was recorded outside the recording studio at locations that held special meaning to Lenker, from his favorite bookstore to his father's mortuary. His album "Man in the Maroon" will be released May 21, 2021, on GrindEthos Records. 
Other works.
Lenker's first book "Medium Hero: And Other Stories" is a collection of twenty-seven short stories inspired by Lenker's years as a touring indie artist. The original version was self-published. Turner Publishing acquisitions manager Stephanie Beard picked up the book at one of his performances. As a result, Turner Publishing offered Lenker a contract and consequently published the book on December 1, 2015.
In 2018, Lenker launched the web series "Morse Code" about a struggling musician trying to balance his personal and professional life. It was produced in part by funds raised in a Patreon campaign. The pilot episode "Boomerang", which was written by and stars Lenker, released to the public on August 3, 2018 on Vimeo.
Collaborations.
In 2004, Lenker collaborated with Stell Newsome (performing together as David Goliath) to produce an album of bluegrass gospel standards called "David Goliath's Old Time Gospel Hour". He co-wrote the song "Friend and a Friend" with Molly Tuttle. The song was consequently released on Lenker's album "Thousand Springs" and Tuttle's album "Rise" in 2017. In 2017, he co-wrote the song "Let's Just Have Supper" with Nora Jane Struthers. The song and its accompanying music video premiered on NPR. Lenker appears as an actor in Rebecca Frazier's 2018 music video for "Darken Your Doorway," playing her love interest.
Awards.
In 2006, Lenker won second place in the country category during the Chris Austin Songwriting Contest at MerleFest with his song "Handful of Dice."

Harry White (Washington politician)

Horace Greely "Harry" White (1859–1940) was an American real estate broker and politician who served as the Mayor of Seattle from 1890 to 1891.
White was the son of the farmer Robert A. White and Hannah E. Newbrough. At the age of 19, he left home for Hamilton County, Nebraska, where he taught school and bought 240 acres of farmland. Between 1883 and 1886 he was manager of a nursery company at York, Nebraska. On December 31, 1885, White married Anna E. Morrow, born in 1864 in Ohio, but living in Harvard, Nebraska. The marriage seems to have remained childless. 
In 1887, they moved to Seattle, where he founded the Harry White &amp; Co. real estate and brokerage firm, in which his younger brothers Will R. and George H. White joined him. His company invested heavily in Seattle, buying large swats of land and spending more on advertising than any other organization in Seattle.
 In July 1889, a month after the Great Seattle Fire that destroyed the entire central business district, he was elected a member of the city council from the First ward. He took great effort in the rebuilding of downtown, for which he was awarded a nomination and election as mayor in July 1890. When Washington became a state on November 11, 1889, Seattle adopted a new charter, and new elections were already held again on October 1, 1890. White was reelected for two years. However, under criticism for his management of public affairs, he resigned on November 30, 1891. The remaining months of his term were completed by fellow progressive Republican George Hall. Clarence B. Bagley wrote about him in his 1916 3-volume history of Seattle that, while in the year after his election "Gambling of every known variety flourished openly, as did harlotry and drunkenness, under the fostering eyes of the police", White had rebuilt Seattle "along modern, progressive lines" and that the "story of Seattle’s advancement since 1889 without mention of Mr. White would be like the play of Hamlet without the appearance of the Danish prince".
White left the public eye, but his investments, especially in Alaska, had made him a rich man. At the end of the century the Whites moved to Los Angeles, California, and before 1900, they had bought a house at 220 S. Bunker Hill Ave., where they lived until at least the 1930s. In the censuses White's profession is listed as "mining promoter" (1900) and "real estate brokerage" (1920,1930). He managed his investments through offices in Seattle and London. White died in 1940 at the age of 81 in Los Angeles.

Zospeum percostulatum

Zospeum percostulatum is a species of air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Ellobiidae, the salt marsh snails. This species is endemic to Asturias, Spain. It is known from several limestone caves near Llanes. Though there were a few old records of Zospeum in Asturias, dubiously identified as Z. suarezi and Z. schaufussi, Zospeum percostulatum is the first species described for this autonomous community. 
"Zospeum percostulatum" are microscopic snails (microgastropods) with a shell height of less than 2 mm (thought relatively large for the genus), with a distinctive surface. Live individuals has been collected on cave walls covered by a wet film of percolated clay.

Seesen station

Seesen station is the largest station in the town of Seesen in the German state of Lower Saxony. Münchehof (Harz) station also still serves the municipality.
It has three platform edges with a length of 140 metres each and a height of 55 centimetres. The station was made barrier-free under the project "Niedersachsen ist am Zug II" ("Lower Saxony is on the train II") for about €2.6 million: lifts were installed on platform 1 and on the island platform with tracks 2 and 4. Each platform has a dynamic train indicator that informs about delays and other deviations from the timetable. The old freight yard in Seesen is no longer used and has been abandoned. The tracks that were no longer needed for freight transport were removed by 2013. Track 3 of the passenger station had already been dismantled.
Station building.
The station building is only used to a limited extent and is now privately owned. In addition to the waiting room, a DB travel agency is also housed in the station building. The "Lebenshilfe" (a self-help association, which assists the disabled) has leased premises to supply help with housework.
Railway lines.
The station is located on the Herzberg–Seesen railway and the Brunswick Southern Railway and thus functions as a junction station. The Seesen–Derneburg railway was decommissioned on 1 January 1996 and partially dismantled. In 2013, plans were made to reactivate the line, but the plans were quickly rejected, as the reactivation would have become uneconomic due to the fact that large parts of the roadbed have been developed as cycle paths.
Rail services.
The station is served by the following services:

Charhi railway station

Charhi railway station is a station on the Koderma–Hazaribagh–Barkakana line in Churchu (community development block), Hazaribagh district, Jharkhand serving Charhi and nearby areas.
Charhi railway station is located at an altitude of 453 m above mean sea level. Hazaribagh Town is 27 km and Barkakana is 30 km from Charhi.
As of 2019, the Koderma–Hazaribagh–Barkakana Passenger stops four times daily at this station (two each way – UP and DOWN).
While the 80 km long Koderma–Hazaribagh line was commissioned in 2015, the 57-km long Hazaribagh–Barkakana section was opened in 2016. Work is in progress on the Barkakana–Ranchi sector. The state government is bearing half of the project cost. As the line passes through a coal mining belt it will carry a lot of coal, in addition to passenger traffic.

List of ambassadors of Spain to the Netherlands

The Spanish Ambassador to the Netherlands is the Ambassador of the Spanish government to the government of the Netherlands.
He is regularly coaccredited to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
History.
The Netherlands were part of the Spanish Monarchy until 1581, during the Dutch Revolt, when a number of provinces issued the Act of Abjuration repudiating Philip II of Spain. In 1609, on concluding the Twelve Years' Truce, Philip III of Spain agreed to deal with the Dutch Republic "as though" it were sovereign. Full mutual recognition and the accreditation of ordinary ambassadors came after the Peace of Münster, during the reign of Philip IV of Spain.

Badge of Glory

Badge of Glory is a nautical historical novel by Douglas Reeman. It forms the initial part of the multi-volume Blackwood saga. which follows the adventures of several generations of Royal Marine officers over 150 years.
Plot.
The year is 1850 and a young Queen Victoria is on the throne. Philip Blackwood, a captain in the Royal Marines, and son and grandson of marine officers, rejoins his ship, "HMS Audacious", which is to sail to West Africa to help stamp out the remains of the slave trade. The ship is part of a squadron commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir James Ashley-Chute. Blackwood’s younger step-brother Harry, a marine second lieutenant, is also aboard, as is Sir Geoffrey Slade, a senior government official.
At Gibraltar, disquieting news reaches Slade by despatch-boat concerning a possible native uprising north of Freetown. Slade needs to proceed as quickly as possible to investigate. He and a detachment of marines transfer to "HMS Satyr", a new and faster steam ship, of the type being newly constructed for the Royal Navy; admired by some but derided by others including Ashley-Chute.
After coaling at Tenerife, they arrive in the Bight of Benin. Following the marines dictum of ‘First to Land-Last to Leave’, Blackwood lands a detachment of marines. They find themselves facing a superior force of natives, led by King Mdlaka. They are clearly trained and armed by white slavers. Despite the British government’s attempts to persuade the natives to take up palm oil production, they have returned to the vastly more lucrative slave trade. Many marines are killed and wounded in the battle, but they are able to relieve the besieged trade fortress, finding few survivors.
Major Rupert Fynmore takes command for the next landing, and further battles take place with the well-entrenched slavers. They are well-armed with cannon and newer rifle-bored weapons that the marines have not yet been issued with. Blackwood is badly wounded and evacuated to ship, initially to Freetown and then back to England. But the hard-fighting marines are victorious, and Lessard, the leader of the slavers, falls, or is pushed, into the hold of a laden slave ship, where he’s torn apart. Slade’s niece, Davern Seymour, who Blackwood had met in Portsmouth and is fascinated with, is also rescued. She had been captured and ill-treated by the slavers. Her father, a doctor, has been horribly killed.
Blackwood’s recovery is slow. His domineering step-mother insists that he will recover better at the family home of Hawks Hill. and he is taken there, with his faithful valet, Private Smithett. He finds his father, the Colonel, bedridden but in good spirits and happy to hear of his son’s exploits.
Blackwood decides to leave home and stay at his club. He accidentally overhears a conversation in which he learns that his step-mother was the mistress of the late Lord Lapidge, from whom she inherited her wealth. He reports for duty in Portsmouth.
The marines are posted to Malta, where Blackwood finds the climate even more stifling than that of West Africa. They spend most of their time on ceremonial duties and drilling with new weapons. Harry Blackwood has an affair with Fynmore’s young wife. Then under Ashley-Chute’s command, they sail for the Black Sea to participate in the Crimean War.
From the port of Varna, the squadron joins battle with Russian ships off the coast near Odessa. The flagship, "HMS Tenacious", is almost overwhelmed, but Blackwood’s marine sharpshooters manage to save the day. Ashley-Chute is killed in the battle.
The marines are ordered to Crimea and land at Balaclava. They march inland, where they are to support the army in storming a well-defended Russian redoubt.
The marines are put into the attack. Fynmore, who has learned that his wife has given birth to a baby, almost certainly Harry’s, angrily gives the latter a dangerous assignment with a grenade party. Harry not only survives, but distinguishes himself.
Blackwood is again badly wounded and wakes up in hospital where he finds Davern nursing him. He is evacuated home to England; the doctors fear for his life, but he does survive. He returns home to Hawks Hill, his marine career almost certainly over. The Colonel has died and he takes up his family inheritance, whilst his step-mother leaves for France. Davern, now amicably separated from his husband, comes to him.

White noise analysis

In probability theory, a branch of mathematics, white noise analysis, otherwise known as Hida calculus, is a framework for infinite-dimensional and stochastic calculus, based on the Gaussian white noise probability space, to be compared with Malliavin calculus based on the Wiener process. It was initiated by Takeyuki Hida in his 1975 Carleton Mathematical Lecture Notes.
The term white noise was first used for signals with a flat spectrum.
White noise measure.
The white noise probability measure formula_1 on the space formula_2 of tempered distributions has the characteristic function
Brownian motion in white noise analysis.
A version of Wiener's Brownian motion formula_4 is obtained by the dual pairing
where formula_6 is the indicator function of the interval formula_7. Informally
and in a generalized sense
Hilbert space.
Fundamental to white noise analysis is the Hilbert space
generalizing the Hilbert spaces formula_11 to infinite dimension.
Wick polynomials.
An orthonormal basis in this Hilbert space, generalizing that of Hermite polynomials, is given by the so-called "Wick", or "normal ordered" polynomials formula_12 with formula_13 and formula_14
with normalization
entailing the Itô-Segal-Wiener isomorphism of the white noise Hilbert space formula_16 with Fock space:
The "chaos expansion"
in terms of Wick polynomials corresponds to the expansion in terms of multiple Wiener integrals. Brownian martingales formula_19 are characterized by kernel functions formula_20 depending on formula_21 only by a "cut off":
Gelfand triples.
Suitable restrictions of the kernel functions formula_23 to be smooth and rapidly decreasing in formula_24 and formula_25 give rise to spaces of white noise test functions formula_26, and, by duality, to spaces of generalized functions formula_27 of white noise, with
generalizing the scalar product in formula_16. Examples are the Hida triple, with
or the more general Kondratiev triples.
T- and S-transform.
Using the white noise test functions
one introduces the "T-transform" of white noise distributions formula_27 by setting
Likewise, using
one defines the "S-transform" of white noise distributions formula_27 by
It is worth noting that for generalized functions formula_37, the S-transform is just
Depending on the choice of Gelfand triple, the white noise test functions and distributions are characterized by corresponding growth and analyticity properties of their S- or T-transforms.
Characterization theorem.
The function formula_39 is the T-transform of a (unique) Hida distribution formula_27 iff for all formula_41 the function formula_42 is analytic in the whole complex plane and of second order exponential growth, i.e. formula_43where formula_44 is some continuous quadratic form on formula_45.The same is true for S-transforms, and similar characterization theorems hold for the more general Kondratiev distributions.
Calculus.
For test functions formula_46, partial, directional derivatives exist:
where formula_48 may be varied by any generalized function formula_49. In particular, for the Dirac distribution formula_50 one defines the "Hida derivative", denoting
Gaussian integration by parts yields the dual operator on distribution space
An infinite-dimensional gradient
is given by
The Laplacian formula_55 ("Laplace–Beltrami operator") with
plays an important role in infinite-dimensional analysis and is the image of the Fock space number operator.
Stochastic integrals.
A stochastic integral, the "Hitsuda-Skorohod integral" can be defined for suitable families formula_57 of white noise distributions as a Pettis integral
generalizing the Itô integral beyond adapted integrands.
Applications.
In general terms, there are two features of white noise analysis which have been prominent in applications.
First, white noise is a generalized stochastic process with independent values at each time. Hence it plays the role of a generalized system of independent coordinates, in the sense that in various contexts it has been fruitful to express more general processes occurring e.g. in engineering or mathematical finance, in terms of white noise.
Second, the characterization theorem given above allows various heuristic expressions to be identified as generalized functions of white noise. This is particularly effective to attribute a well-defined mathematical meaning to so-called "functional integrals". Feynman integrals in particular have been given rigorous meaning for large classes of quantum dynamical models.
Noncommutative extensions of the theory have grown under the name of quantum white noise, and finally, the rotational invariance of the white noise characteristic function provides a framework for representations of infinite-dimensional rotation groups.

Jari Aarnio

Jari Seppo Aarnio (born 5 September 1957) is the former head of Helsinki's anti-drugs police. He has been sentenced to jail for drug crimes, murder and other offences.
Aarnio spent 30 years in the anti-drugs force. He grew up in a suburb of Helsinki, and became a police officer in 1979. He was a chief investigator in a case against "drug baron" Miika Kortekallio in 1986. Kortekallio was sentenced to jail; Aarnio wrote his graduation essay about the Kortekallio league. He was named "policeman of the year" in 1987.
During 2011 and 2012, Aarnio abused his position by helping a gang smuggle and sell 800 kg of hashish into Finland. He also threatened a suspect, and tried to frame an innocent man for being in charge of the drug ring. He also used his position and experience to try to mislead his colleagues and to conceal evidence.
In 2017, Aarnio appealed to overturn his prison sentence. In July 2018, Aarnio was accused of murder, and was arrested for having allegedly failed to prevent a planned murder of which he had evidence in 2003. In December 2020, he was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Volkan Ünsal.

Lovebites (band)

Lovebites (stylized as LOVEBITES) is a Japanese all-female heavy metal band, formed in 2016 by former Destrose members Miho and Haruna. Its lineup currently consists of Haruna on drums, Midori and Miyako on guitar, and Asami on vocals. After signing to Victor Entertainment, the group released both their debut EP and their first album, "The Lovebites EP" and "Awakening from Abyss", in 2017 before performing their first overseas concerts at the end of the year. With another EP and album released in 2018, "Battle Against Damnation" and "Clockwork Immortality", Lovebites quickly garnered international attention and won that year's Metal Hammer Golden Gods Award for Best New Band. They released their third album, "Electric Pentagram", in 2020, and it reached number 9 on the Oricon chart, becoming their highest-charting to date. After releasing the EP "Glory, Glory, to the World" in March 2021, bassist Miho left the band in August and Lovebites began a temporary hiatus.
History.
Formation and first album (2016–2017).
Lovebites was formed in Tokyo in 2016 by bassist Miho and drummer Haruna. The two met while members of Destrose, another all-female metal band that disbanded in 2015. After recruiting guitarist Midori and support guitarist and keyboardist Miyako (then known as Mi-Ya), the four chose vocalist Asami based on a demo she made. Midori was in the band Gekijo Metalicche, Miyako was a member of A Drop of Joker and 21g, while Asami was a backup singer for Vamps and Uverworld. During one rehearsal, the musicians performed "Love Bites (So Do I)" by Halestorm. Feeling that the song fit well with Asami's voice, it left an impression on all of the members and they chose Lovebites as the name for their new band. They had their first concert on November 18, 2016 at Tsutaya O-West.
Lovebites released their debut EP, "The Lovebites EP", in May 2017 via Victor Entertainment. Miho explained that it was more of a demo to get the band signed, but the label liked it so much they had it properly mastered and released. It was mixed by Mikko Karmila and mastered by Mika Jussila, who have worked with acts like Nightwish, Children of Bodom, and Stratovarius, at Finnvox Studios in Helsinki, Finland. The EP was released in the United Kingdom on August 25 by JPU Records and in North America by Sliptrick Records on August 31.
Support member Miyako became a full member of the band in August 2017. Their first full-length album "Awakening from Abyss" was released in Japan and North America on October 25, and in the UK two days later. It was again mixed and mastered by Karmila and Jussila and includes re-recordings of the four tracks from their debut EP. The group played just a handful of shows before their first gigs outside Japan: two nights at Hyper Japan Christmas and one show at Camden Underworld, both in London at the end of November 2017.
International recognition and hiatus (2018–2021).
In 2018, Lovebites performed on the Japanese leg of Warped Tour and released their second EP "Battle Against Damnation" on June 6. Days later, they won the 2018 Metal Hammer Golden Gods Award for Best New Band. They performed at Wacken Open Air on August 4, becoming the first Japanese all-female rock band to appear at the German festival. They also performed on the main stage at Bloodstock Open Air on August 10, 2018. In November, Lovebites held their first European tour that saw them visit the Netherlands, Germany, France and the UK. The band released their second album "Clockwork Immortality" on December 5 in Japan. Limited editions of the album include a DVD or Blu-ray of the concert video "Battle in the East", which was recorded on June 28, 2018 at Tsutaya O-East. It was released in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand two days later by Arising Empire, and in the UK by JPU Records on January 18, 2019.
Lovebites was the opening act for Arch Enemy at two shows in Shanghai and Beijing, China on March 23 and 24, 2019. In June, they performed at the Download Festival in both Donington, UK and Madrid, Spain and at the Graspop Metal Meeting in Dessel, Belgium. Their set at Donington was cited by its organizers and Metal Hammer as one of the festival's highlight performances, including when Asami joined Halestorm on stage to sing her band's namesake song, which she had also done earlier at Download Festival Japan on March 21.
On July 10, Lovebites released their first standalone concert video and live album, "Daughters of the Dawn – Live in Tokyo", recorded on January 27, 2019 at Mynavi Blitz Akasaka. They were a support act on DragonForce's UK tour throughout the first half of November, and opened for Halestorm in Tokyo on December 2. The band's third studio album, "Electric Pentagram", was released on January 29, 2020. It was set to be supported by a seven-date Japanese tour from February 14 to April 12, but the last three concerts were postponed until June due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. On July 22, Lovebites released their second standalone concert video and live album, "Five of a Kind – Live in Tokyo 2020", recorded on February 21, 2020 at Zepp DiverCity. To celebrate the third anniversary of "Awakening from Abyss", the band streamed a live studio performance titled Awake Again, where they played the album in its entirety on October 25.
Lovebites wrote the song "Winds of Transylvania" to be used as the opening theme of the anime series "Vlad Love" and were named an official ambassador for the series. Its director, Mamoru Oshii, commented that "I could immediately see parallels between the five members and the main character of "Vlad Love". They are like a heretic of heavy metal, wearing bright white outfits while playing intense music, they are the perfect choice to take charge of a theme song to an anime not bound by convention or common sense. And above all, their name couldn't be more fitting!" The band members appear in the anime's opening credits, which also features "Vlad Love"s fictional characters performing the song in a sequence that the animators based on the band's. A CD including "Winds of Transylvania" and the three other themes of the anime was released at Ichigo Animation's CulZone stores on January 9, 2021.
Lovebites released their third EP "Glory, Glory, to the World", which they recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 10, 2021. The sold out national Ride for Vengeance Tour was originally set to take place between January 24 and March 5, but was rescheduled to between March 12 and April 6 following the Japanese government's declaration of a second state of emergency due to the pandemic and its extension. The March 26 performance at Tokyo Dome City Hall was filmed and recorded for release as the "Heavy Metal Never Dies – Live in Tokyo 2021" concert video and live album on September 29.
On August 17, 2021, bassist Miho announced her departure from the band. The other members and their staff had held "countless meetings to find a way for her to stay," but ultimately decided to respect her decision. As a result, Lovebites temporarily suspended all activities, but assured fans that they will return. Between September 10–26, the band accepted votes via social media to help decide the tracklist of their first "best of" album. The two-disc compilation will feature remastered versions of the songs and an additional disc containing all of their music videos.
Music and influences.
Although hailing from Tokyo, Lovebites' music is heavily influenced by the new wave of British heavy metal which led their music to be compared to Iron Maiden and Rage. Miho said she always wanted to play a combination of power metal and "a little bit of old school [heavy metal]." She also noted that their decision to wear all-white clothing, as opposed to the genre's stereotypical black, was made to contrast with their old school sound and have them stand out. Their lyrics are written in English even though the musicians do not speak the language fluently. An exception is the Haruna-penned song "Bravehearted" on their debut EP, which was written in Japanese and intended for Destrose.
The group frequently collaborates with former Light Bringer keyboardist Mao on composing and arranging songs. All of their releases have been mixed and mastered by Finnish audio engineers Mikko Karmila and Mika Jussila, and all of their album cover illustrations since "Awakening from Abyss" have been created by Spanish artists David López Gómez and Carlos Vincente León. These album covers all feature a wolf to symbolize that, by playing the non-mainstream genre of heavy metal, Lovebites are a "lone wolf" in the music scene. The wolf is a mascot to represent the band, like Eddie for Iron Maiden or Vic Rattlehead for Megadeth.
Miho has been strongly into hard rock and heavy metal since junior high, and started playing bass in high school. Her favorite bands are Iron Maiden, Pantera, Mötley Crüe and Anthrax. She referred to her playing as more showmanship than technical, and cited Steve Harris as a particular influence alongside the style of Nikki Sixx.
Haruna has played drums since she was thirteen years old, and began writing songs on a keyboard at fourteen. From elementary school up to high school her favorite band was B'z, but she became interested in heavy metal after hearing Helloween's "Master of the Rings". As a result, she stated her basic drumming style is that of Uli Kusch.
Midori started to learn piano at around two years of age and electric organ at eight, but gave up both upon entering university and started to learn guitar at 20. She is a graduate of Musicians Institute Japan in Osaka, and listed Kiko Loureiro, Nuno Bettencourt and Yngwie Malmsteen as her biggest guitar influences. Generally speaking, Midori said that she plays the "flashy and aggressive" guitar solos in the band, while Miyako plays the "slower, more melodic" ones.
Miyako has played classical piano since she was three and guitar since high school. Having grown up listening to classic rock bands like Deep Purple and Rainbow with her mother, Miyako ended up being very influenced by Ritchie Blackmore. But she has also been influenced by more modern guitarists, such as Timothy Henson and Scott LePage from Polyphia. It was Disarmonia Mundi's Ettore Rigotti who inspired Miyako to start composing and arranging songs.
Asami comes from a R&amp;B and soul music background and likes artists such as Alicia Keys and Aretha Franklin. Starting at the age of two, she performed classical ballet for about 16 years before moving to America after high school to study jazz and hip-hop dance.

Paraje de San Diego

Paraje de San Diego was a camping place, overlooking the Rio Grande, along the route of the Jornada del Muerto. It was located 5 leagues north of the Paraje de Robledo and "half a league from the river". 
Bishop of Durango, Pedro Tamarón y Romeral, wrote of this location during his 1760 visitation to New Mexico: 
During this thirteenth day they had traveled 20 leagues until eight-thirty at night, when they halted opposite the Sierra de Fray Cristóbal. After a 10 league journey on the 14th of May, the Bishop reached the Rio Grande again at eleven‑thirty, at the Paraje de Fray Cristóbal, leaving the Jornada del Muerto.
The location given by Bishop Tamarón places Paraje de San Diego on the heights overlooking the Rincon Valley north of San Diego Mountain above Tonuco Draw, southeast of the location of Rincon, New Mexico. At the time the Bishop wrote the Rio Grande must have had a different course than today to be half a league away. It would have to pass close to the east side of the valley close to the foot of the bluffs where the paraje was located and at the foot of San Diego Mountain.

Raid on Canso (1776)

The Raid on Canso took place on 22 September – November 22, 1776 during the American Revolutionary War. The raid involved American Continental Navy captain John Paul Jones attacking Canso, Nova Scotia (now part of Canada) and the surrounding fishing villages. 
Background.
During the American Revolution, Americans regularly attacked Nova Scotia by land and sea. American privateers devastated the maritime economy by raiding many of the coastal communities, such as the numerous raids on Liverpool and on Annapolis Royal.
George Washington's Marblehead Regiment raided Charlottetown, now in Prince Edward Island, on 17 November 1775, and three days later they raided Canso Harbor.
Raid.
On September 22, 1776, Canso was attacked by American privateer John Paul Jones. The privateer sailed on the and destroyed fifteen vessels, and damaged much property on shore. There he recruited men to fill the vacancies created by manning his prizes, burned a British fishing schooner, sank a second, and captured a third besides a shallop which he used as a tender. 
Jones then pillaged the community of Petit-de-Grat and Arichat on Isle Madame, Nova Scotia. The nine ships (300 men) immediately surrendered. On the evening of September 25, a gale droved three of the prizes on to shore and they were destroyed. (The remaining prizes were Alexander, Kingston Packet, Success and Defence.) Jones destroyed John Robin’s fishing business when they plundered and razed the entire establishment. The business of John Robin ended and he did not return until after the war. Jones then sailed to Boston only to return two months later.
On 22 November, John Paul Jones returned to Canso in the . Boats from the ship went ashore and he raided the community, his crews burned a transport bound for Canada with provisions and a warehouse full of whale oil, besides capturing a small schooner. He took 6 prizes, 1 burned, 1 confiscated. 
Captain Jones then went on to present-day Sydney, Nova Scotia to free 300 Americans imprisoned in the British coalmines.
Aftermath.
Again in 1779, American privateers destroyed the Canso fisheries, worth $50,000 a year to England.
American privateers remained a threat to Nova Scotian ports for the rest of the war. For example, after a failed attempt to raid Chester, Nova Scotia, American privateers struck again in the Raid on Lunenburg in 1782.

1924 United States presidential election in Arkansas

The 1924 United States presidential election in Arkansas was held on November 4, 1924 as part of the 1924 United States presidential election. State voters chose nine electors, or representatives to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice-President.
Background and vote.
Except for the Unionist Ozark counties of Newton and Searcy where Republicans controlled local government, Arkansas since the end of Reconstruction had been a classic one-party Democratic “Solid South” state. Disfranchisement during the 1890s of effectively all Negroes and most poor whites had meant that outside those two aberrant counties, the Republican Party was completely moribund and Democratic primaries the only competitive elections. Although the northwest of the state was to develop a strong Socialist Party movement that served as a swing vote in county elections, political repression and internal party divisions diminished that party’s strength substantially.
The Democratic Party, under the influence of future federal Senate Minority and Majority Leader Joseph Taylor Robinson and demagogic Governor and Senator Jeff Davis, was to make many familiar progressive changes in railroad regulation and child labor, but under the administration of George W. Donaghey – who saw his administration and Democratic primary candidacy as a fight against the “Davis Machine” – more rapid development occurred, especially in abolishing convict leasing and improving bank regulation.
Race riots and fear of the Bolshevik Revolution spreading and destroying American capitalism ensued when many soldiers returned from World War I, and President Woodrow Wilson responded with the Palmer Raids and a “Red Scare”. Isolationism was sufficiently powerful in Ozark sections of Arkansas that Warren G. Harding, with almost forty percent of the statewide vote in 1920, gained the most support for any GOP candidate since disfranchisement of Black Americans.
However, with the anti-Democratic opposition split and isolationism cooling, Davis more than doubled James M. Cox’s 1920 margin. Republican Coolidge – though winning a national landslide and carrying every state except the former Confederacy plus culturally and politically allied Oklahoma – carried as Charles Evans Hughes did eight years previously only the two traditional Unionist Ozark counties.

Peter Humblot

Peter Humblot (13 March 1779 - 11 December 1828) was a German book seller and publisher.
Life.
Peter Humblot was born in Berlin. He was the second son of a knife maker from Langres in Champagne who had relocated to Berlin where he believed - correctly, as matters turned out - that there would be more possibilities for expanding his business than in small-town eastern France. He was able to afford a good education for his children: Peter attended Berlin' well-regarded until he was 14. He then embarked on an apprenticeship with the "Franckesche Buchhandlung" (book dealer). In a conscious move to prepare himself for work in the book trade, in his spare time he studied the history of literature, bibliography and encyclopaediae. His excellent memory and excellent knowledge of languages enabled him to gain a broad education in this way. Meanwhile, on the international front an uneasy peace had been restored by the Peace of Basel in 1795, and in 1798 Humblot relocated to Braunschweig where his transferred his apprenticeship to the "Thomassche Buchhandlung". Two years later, having concluded his apprenticeship, but finding the opportunities in Braunschweig somewhat limited, he moved south to Basel where he worked with the "Deckersche Buchhandlung". He built up excellent business relationships in Basel, but in 1802 was drawn back to Berlin to take up a position with the book dealer and publishing house, where an opportunity had arisen following the death of one of the proprietors of the business.
Shortly afterwards, however, he moved to Paris, which appeared to offer more promising commercial prospects. However, by 1806, he was back in Berlin where, between October 1806 and December 1808, matters were complicated by French military occupation of the city. Meanwhile Humblot's friend, Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Duncker, was running the publishing business built up by Heinrich Frölich. Frölich had recruited Duncker as an assistant and then, just six weeks later, died suddenly in March 1806. Duncker spent the next two years returning the business to solvency, despite the unwavering opposition of Frölich's widow. In 1808, Duncker persuaded his former employer's widow to sell him the business. To do this, he needed a partner, presumably for financial reasons. On 1 January 1809, Duncker and Humblot acquired the business, agreeing to share profits and losses on an equal basis. The business was renamed , which is the name under which it continues to trade (2018).
In 1828, Peter Humblot was elected a . He died later that same year.
Personal.
In 1812, Peter Humblot married Amélie Jordan (1789–1877), the daughter of a Berlin jeweller. Their daughter Bertha later married the physicist-chemist Heinrich Gustav Magnus.

2018 AFL Women's Grand Final

The 2018 AFL Women's Grand Final was an Australian rules football match held on 24 March 2018 to determine the premiers of the 2018 AFL Women's season, the league's second season. It was contested by the and and was won by the Western Bulldogs. The Bulldogs claimed their first AFL Women's premiership, whilst Brisbane suffered their second consecutive loss by six points in a Grand Final.
Background.
The Australian Football League (AFL) continued with the top-two qualification system, whereby the two highest ranked clubs would qualify for the grand final, rather than having a finals series. The date of the match clashed with the opening round of the 2018 AFL season, however the start time of 12:35 pm Australian Eastern Daylight Saving Time allowed the match to conclude before the first AFL premiership match to be held later that day, which featured the Brisbane men's team.
Qualification.
Entering the final round of the regular season, five clubs were a mathematical chance of qualifying for the grand final, with the Bulldogs tied with on points but ahead on percentage in the top two positions. The Brisbane Lions were considered the least likely to qualify, as they were in fifth place and needed to defeat away from home and then rely on results in other matches.
Brisbane's surprise 40-point win against Greater Western Sydney saw them leapfrog , and into second place. The Bulldogs narrowly defeated Melbourne the following night, thereby clinching qualification and keeping Brisbane's season alive. were considered strong favourites in the final match of the regular season against , but Collingwood ran away with a surprise victory to ensure that Brisbane retained second position and qualified for their second consecutive grand final. Adelaide's match was watched on television by the Brisbane players, who celebrated wildly after it concluded. Despite the loss, Adelaide coach Bec Goddard congratulated the Western Bulldogs and Brisbane Lions for clinching the two spots in the grand final, saying "the two sides...are in there and I'm sure they will have a cracking contest next week."
Venue.
It was announced by the AFL that the 2018 AFL Women's Grand Final would be played at Ikon Park. The decision was made on the basis that Ikon Park could manage a greater capacity than the Western Bulldogs' home ground the Whitten Oval. It was the first time an AFL Women's Grand Final was played in Melbourne.
Match summary.
The game was played in wet and blustery conditions, with heavy rain falling in the hours leading up to the game. This kept the crowd numbers down, with most huddled under the sheltered areas, and caused the scheduled pre-match entertainment by Missy Higgins to be cancelled. The first quarter opened with a Brisbane goal. Speedster Kate McCarthy brought the ball out of the centre and delivered it to forward Jess Wuetschner, who found Sophie Conway unmarked 20 metres out from goal with a precision pass. Conway then converted.
Conway had another opportunity a few minutes later, but chose to attempt a snap shot herself rather than send the ball to Wuetschner, who was alone in the goal square, and missed everything. Conway's goal was the only one kicked by either side in the first half. The Western Bulldogs seemed unable to get past key Brisbane defender Kate Lutkins. Kaitlyn Ashmore also had an opportunity from 15 metres out just before the half time siren, but also missed everything.
After the half time break, the rain abated, and Bulldogs midfielders Ellie Blackburn and Emma Kearney began to wrest control of the centre of the oval. The game remained tough and physical, with Kearney, who was well-contained by Brisbane tagger Nat Exon for most of the day, turning aside assistance offered by one of the trainers, and there were injury concerns for Kirsty Lamb. Deanna Berry somehow evaded two defenders and managed to kick the Bulldogs' first goal with a long shot from outside the 50-metre arc.
This was followed in quick succession by another, dribbled in by Kirsten McLeod, who had been brought in to replace the suspended Katie Brennan, but had not touched the ball in the first half. Monique Conti, an 18-year-old who also played in the basketball grand final with the Melbourne Boomers, and wound up being voted best on ground, concluded the third term with a goal from a ball delivered to her by McLeod, giving the Bulldogs a 14-point lead.
The Brisbane Lions fought back in the final quarter. Wuetschner dribbled in a goal to peg the Bulldogs' lead back to eight points. Kearney responded with a fourth Bulldogs goal, but Wuetschner kicked her second in reply. In the dying minutes of the game, the Brisbane Lions surged forward, seeking a fourth major that would tie the game and send it into extra time. The ball was marked in the dying seconds of the game by Bulldogs' defender Naomi Ferres, who grasped it as the final siren sounded.
When it came time to raise the winner's cup at the end of medal presentations, acting captain Ellie Blackburn declared: "I can't hold that cup up alone – KB, get up here!" The two raised the cup together, Brennan lifting her shirt to reveal the Bulldogs' guernsey beneath. The gesture invoked memories of the 2016 AFL Grand Final, when injured Bulldogs skipper Robert Murphy was similarly called up on stage to raise the cup.
Teams.
The teams were announced on 22 March. Western Bulldogs captain Katie Brennan was a prominent exclusion from the team, after she was suspended by the Tribunal for a sling tackle executed in the final match of the home-and-away season against Melbourne. The tribunal's decision to reject Brennan's appeal was met with surprise by some, who thought the punishment was not in line with expectations in the men's game. Brennan subsequently lodged a proceeding with the Australian Human Rights Commission in an attempt to have the AFL amend the differences between the AFLW regulations and the AFL regulations. Brisbane named an unchanged line-up.
Media coverage.
The 2018 AFL Women's Grand Final was broadcast on the Seven Network, as part of a broadcasting rights deal that saw Seven West Media gain broadcasting rights to all matches of the 2018 AFL Women's season, airing on the Seven Network, 7mate, or the video on demand service, PLUS7. Outside of Australia, it was made available live and for replay on the Watch AFL subscription web site and app.

La festa d'Imeneo

La festa d'Imeneo (The Festival of Hymenaeus) is a serenata by Nicola Porpora, with a libretto by Paolo Rolli. It was premiered at the King's Theatre on 4 May 1736 by the Opera of the Nobility to mark the marriage of Porpora's patron Frederick, Prince of Wales to Augusta of Saxe-Gotha on 27 April that year. The lead role was sung by Senesino, but it proved unsuccessful in the face of Handel's "Atalanta", premiered later that month to mark the marriage. Imeneo's opening aria, "Vaghi amori", has been recorded occasionally.
An aria recorded by Cecilia Bartoli was played on NPR news on December 26, 2019.

The Christian (1914 film)

The Christian (1914) is a silent film drama, directed by Frederick A. Thomson, and costarring Earle Williams and Edith Storey. The film is based on the novel "The Christian" by Hall Caine, published in 1897, the first British novel to reach the record of one million copies sold. The novel was adapted for the stage, opening on Broadway at the Knickerbocker Theatre 10 October 1898. This was the second film of the story; the first, "The Christian" (1911) was made in Australia.
Plot.
John Storm decides to enter a monastery after his girlfriend Glory Quayle becomes a diva of London's stages. Not being able to forget Glory, John leaves the monastery to devote himself to the destitute and opens a refuge in the London slums. Glory, who has become his neighbour, tells him about her friend Polly who was pregnant by Lord Robert Ure, an aristocrat. As an unmarried mother Polly is disgraced and is dismissed from the hospital where she works as a nurse. John confronts Ure telling him to do his duty by marrying the girl. Ure, enraged by Storm's interference, marries Vera, a rich American woman. John publicly exposes Ure, but he takes his revenge by spreading the word that Storm makes catastrophic predictions and is announcing the end of the world on Derby Day. Riots break out in the slums. Glory manages to convince people that John is innocent of Ure's accusations. John and Glory decide to spend their lives together.
Production.
"The Christian" was produced by the Vitagraph Company of America in association with the Liebler Company. It was the first eight reel film they made. Shooting was done in part at North Scituate in Rhode Island, at Winthrop Beach, in Massachusetts and in several places between Boston and Philadelphia. Frederick Stanhope, assistant to Frederick A. Thomson, was the theatrical director who had performed the Broadway work for Liebler Co. Viola Allen, the show's star, wanted to play Glory Quayle in the film, but Edith Storey wanted the role for herself. Caine wrote the film scenario, the first time ever that a famous author undertook a film scenario of their own work. Vitagraph staff writer Eugene Mullins followed Caine's scenario.
Distribution.
Distributed by the Vitagraph-Liebler Feature Film Company, "The Christian" was released in US cinemas on 16 March 1914. It premiered in New York at the Manhattan Opera House. Vitagraph leased the Harris Theatre on West 42nd Street, for the purpose of exclusively showing their own films, opening with "The Christian".
A new edition of it was made in 1917 by the Greater Vitagraph (V-L-S-E, Incorporated).

Tvoje lice zvuči poznato (Croatian season 5)

Tvoje lice zvuči poznato is the Croatian version of "Your Face Sounds Familiar". It first aired on 18 March 2018, and concluded the run on 10 June 2018. The previous judges (actor Goran Navojec, vocalist Sandra Bagarić and musician Tomo in der Mühlen) have left the show and have been replaced by the winners of the previous four seasons.
Format.
The show challenges celebrities (singers and actors) to perform as different iconic music artists every week, which are chosen by the show's "Randomiser". They are then judged by the panel of celebrity judges. Each celebrity gets transformed into a different singer every week, and performs an iconic song and dance routine well known by that particular singer. The Randomiser can choose any older or younger artist available in the machine, even a singer of the opposite sex, or a deceased singer. In third season (Week 3), ability to use a joker was introduced. If celebrity wasn't happy with the Randomiser's output or thought that the task is too hard, they could ask some other celebrity to perform instead of them, but just once per season. It was announced that the show will get even more new content in the fourth season, but the 'Joker' ability was removed. The new content in the fourth season was the introduction of holographic performances. If the "Randomiser" chooses a celebrity should perform a duet, they can do it using the pre-recorded hologram for one of the given singers. In the fifth season, celebrity contestant can perform as another celebrity with a child transformed in the same celebrity. The child-contestant duo acts include: Damir Poljicak &amp; David Bojcic as Elvis Presley, Davor Dretar &amp; Ivor Leskovar as Will Smith, Paola Valic Bekic &amp; Tara Roki as Taylor Swift, Amel Curic &amp; Vito Ljubicic as Miso Kovac, Maja Bajamic &amp; Elena Brnic as Beyonce Knowles, Marko Knesaurek &amp; Ursula Divosevic as Katy Perry, Katarina Baban &amp; Gabrijel Rodic as Bruno Mars, and Ana Vilenica &amp; Eva Biljan as Whitney Houston. The winner of every episode gets to donate 10 000 HRK, while the overall leader gets to donate 40 000 HRK at the end of the season. The show lasts for 13 weeks.
Voting.
The contestants are awarded points from the judges (and each other) based on their singing and dance routines. Judges award from 4 to 12 - excluding 11 - points to each contestant. After that, each contestant gives 5 points to a fellow contestant of their choice (known as "Bonus" points). In week 12 (semi-final week), four contestants with the highest number of votes will qualify to the final. In week 13 (grand final), previous points will be transformed into a 4-7 system, the jury will award from 8 to 12 points, and contestants will give 5 points to a fellow contestant of their choice.

Hyper-velocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response (HAMMER) is a concept study by NASA on a spacecraft (8 tonnes) capable of detonating a nuclear bomb to deflect an asteroid, if it was on a collision course to Earth. The study is a collaboration between the National Nuclear Security Administration, NASA, and two Energy Department weapons labs.
Bennu.
NASA is working on a modelling study that considers the asteroid 101955 Bennu, which has a diameter of 246 meters and capable of a 1.15 gigaton impact, as a modelling target for the HAMMER concept. It is circling the Sun at 63,000 mph and 54 million miles from the Earth. Bennu was first discovered in 1999 and on 21 September 2135, it has a 1 in 2,700 chance to hit the Earth. 
The two realistic responses considered in the study are the use of a spacecraft functioning as either a kinetic impactor or a nuclear explosive carrier to deflect the approaching asteroid.

It is a newly built place. Stairs from three sides descend to the greenish water of the Yamuna. Above there is a park which is covered with green grass.
Around the corner of Akbar's Fort near Triveni Sangam, this ghat hosts a nightly aarti with lighting of lamps. There are facilities of food court also routes to reach Sangam by boat from here.
Ropeway facility.
If all goes as per the plan, Allahabad is likely to get a ropeway facility over Yamuna near Sangam before Kumbh.
The tourism department has forwarded a proposal to the state government for approval.
“Two sites- Boat Club and near Saraswati Ghat have been suggested in the proposal for the facility. It will take tourists to a stretch near Arail,” said Anupam Srivastava, regional tourism officer.

Hotel.
Builder and owner is Klaus-Michael Kühne.
The building is located in Hamburg-Rotherbaum on the road "Fontenay" on the southwestern shores of Außenalster and offers 131 guest rooms and suites, some with Alster view. The organic architecture was designed by the architect Jan Störmer. The lobby, called "Atrium Lounge", has a room height of 27 meters.
History.
The hotel is named after the shipbroker John Fontenay, who acquired a large plot of land in front of the Dammtor at the Aussenalster in 1816, through which today the street Fontenay runs. The building stands on the site of the former InterContinental hotel, also called "InterConti". It had to close in February 2013 due to bankruptcy.

Sempulapeyaneerar

Sempulapeyaneerar (Tamil: செம்புலப் பெயனீரார், literally "he of water that has rained on red fields") was a poet of the Sangam period, to whom a sole verse of the Sangam literature has been attributed.
Biography.
Sempulapeyaneerar is said to have hailed from a geographic region with an abundance of red clay. With the Tamil literary tradition's practice of identifying a poet by a phrase or word from his or her poem, Sempulapeyaneerar came to be known so owing to his usage of the imagery "red earth and pouring rain" to denote the union of loving couples in his Sangam verse.
Contribution to the Sangam literature.
Sempulapeyaneerar wrote a sole Sangam verse, verse 40 of the Kurunthogai, and also compiled the Kurunthogai anthology. It is arguably one of the most renowned and oft-quoted of the Sangam anthology. It speaks about two lovers uniting, with the man reassuring his ladylove of his love.
Legacy.
Verse 40 of the Kurunthogai inspired many down the centuries, chiefly by its powerful imagery in the words "red earth and pouring rain" which is considered very evocative. It is the inspiration behind the title of Vikram Chandra's award-winning English novel, "Red Earth and Pouring Rain." The poem was exhibited in the London metro train service in 2001. 
The original lyrics of the Yayum poem was part of the album by American composer Rajan Somasundaram and was featured in Amazon's Top#10 International Music albums in July 2020. 
The poetry has also inspired several Tamil film songs, including 'Oru Thanga rathathil' from "Dharma Yuddham", 'Narumugaye' from movie "Iruvar", 'Solai poovil malai thenral' from movie "Vellai Roja", 'Pattam poochi' from movie "Chithiram Pesuthadi", 'Munbe Vaa' from movie "Sillunu Oru Kaadhal", 'Yaayum' 
from Movie "Sagaa".

Asaphodes frivola

Asaphodes frivola, also known as the remuremu looper moth or Foveaux looper moth, is a species of moth in the family Geometridae with flightless females. It is endemic to New Zealand, and critically endangered, occurring in a very narrow and specialised habitat at just two small coastal sites near Invercargill.
Description.
"Asaphodes frivola" is a small straw-coloured moth with a wingspan of nearly 30 mm. Only the males can fly; females have twisted, useless wings but have long legs and are swift runners. Several other New Zealand moth species have flightless females; flightlessness allows females to carry more eggs, but severely limits the ability of the species to disperse to new home ranges. Eggs are laid in autumn and hatch after a month. Larvae are a dull greenish-grey with pink tinges, developing a herringbone pattern on their back as they slowly grow to 20 mm long. They likely pupate after nine months, but this has not yet been observed. Adult "A. frivola" emerge between mid March and mid April and are active on warm nights. Males are easily disturbed in the daytime and will fly short distances before resettling.
Taxonomy and nomenclature.
"A. frivola" was first described by Edward Meyrick in 1913 under the name "Xanthorhoe frivola," from a single male specimen collected "in swampy forest near Invercargill" in 1912 by Alfred Philpott and sent to the British Museum, where it remains today. Philpott later noted when listing the moth species of Otago that "The type specimen is said to have been taken at Invercargill by myself, but I am quite unable to identify the species." Hudson mentioned "X. frivola" in his 1928 "Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand", but did not have access to the holotype so did not illustrate it. Dugdale later determined this species was actually a member of the genus "Asaphodes".
After the collection of a single specimen in 1912 this moth were not seen again for almost 70 years. On 19 March 1981 lepidopterist Brian Patrick was collecting "Asaphodes oraria" at the Invercargill suburb of Otatara, and at Sandy Point just across the Oreti River he discovered the males and flightless females of what appeared to be a new "Asaphodes" species. They turned out to be "A. frivola".
This species has no universally accepted common name in English or Māori, and is sometimes simply called "little brown moth", but it has been referred to as the Foveaux looper moth, after nearby Foveaux Strait, and the bonking grass moth or remuremu looper moth after its presumed host plant.
Distribution and habitat.
Philpott likely collected the holotype specimen at the New River Estuary, at the mouths of the Waihopai and Oreti Rivers, the same area where the Sandy Point population was discovered in 1981. In 1984 a second population was found at Tiwai Point near Bluff, and 10 males and 5 females were collected there in a 2011 survey. On 18 April 2013 a third population was discovered by Department of Conservation entomologist Eric Edwards at the Three Sisters Sand Dune, on the southern side of the New River Estuary between Bluff and Omaui. A 2014 survey could no longer find "A. frivola" at Sandy Point; it seems to have disappeared from a combination of human disturbance (off-road 4WD vehicles have badly damaged the site) and the replacement of native vegetation with exotic weeds. The world population therefore appears to be confined to Tiwai Point and Three Sisters. As of 2014, only 34 males and 6 females of this species had ever been found.
"A. frivola" only occurs along a small area of the Southland coast, in a narrow (30–50 cm) and fragmented strip of short tussock grassland right next to shell or gravel beaches. The dominant plants in this habitat are knobby club rush ("Ficinia nodosa") and silver tussock ("Poa cita"). After a 2014 survey, Brian Patrick and botanist Brian Rance hypothesised that "A. frivola"'s host plant was the coastal buttercup species "Ranunculus glabrifolius", based on observed feeding damage on the leaves; "Ranunculus" species are popular hosts for the genus "Asaphodes". Subsequent surveys suggest the host is more likely to be the succulent creeping herb "Selliera radicans", known as remuremu or bonking grass.
Conservation.
"A. frivola" is at high risk of extinction, and has already disappeared from one of its three known localities. Its main population, at Tiwai Point, occupies less than 25 m² of coastal vegetation, and the second population at Three Sisters Sand Dune is likely to be a similar size. Both sites are vulnerable to further fragmentation, off-road vehicles, road expansion, invasive weeds, and fire. Without management, "A. frivola" is predicted to go extinct within 10–30 years. The Department of Conservation gave it the threat ranking "Nationally Endangered" in 2012, which was increased in 2014 to "Nationally Critical".

Florence "Flo" Bilton (1921 – 22 July 2004) was an English association football coach and administrator. She was an officer of the Women's Football Association (WFA) from its formation in 1969 until its incorporation into The FA in 1993.
Bilton's involvement in football began in 1963, when she put together a female team from the Reckitt &amp; Colman factory where she worked to play a nearby Smith &amp; Nephew factory. Reckitt &amp; Colman won 2–1, with Bilton playing as a veteran goalkeeper. She remained as Reckitt &amp; Colman manager and was secretary of the nascent Hull League. She later helped local players Carol Thomas and Gail Borman progress to the England national team.
As a founding member of the WFA, Bilton undertook a variety of unglamorous but important off-field roles during the organisation's 24-year history. She borrowed an England national football team cap from her neighbour Raich Carter and then made copies for England's female national team players.
Former England player Wendy Owen praised Bilton in her 2005 autobiography: "She was a wonderful person who could and did turn her hand to just about anything that might help other women to get enjoyment out of the game." In 1997 Sue Lopez declared: "Flo Bilton is one of the unsung heroines and one of the greatest supporters of women's football."
In 2018 Bilton was awarded a commemorative plaque by her home city of Kingston upon Hull. At the Guildhall unveiling, former England captains Karen Walker and Carol Thomas both made speeches in Bilton's honour.

Noël Sullivan

Reginald Noël Sullivan (December 25, 1890 – September 15, 1956) was a wealthy American concert singer, philanthropist and patron of the arts, who is remembered for entertaining performers, artists and writers in his opulent residence on Hyde Street, San Francisco. He befriended many African Americans, providing support for their welfare.
Early life and education.
Born in San Francisco on 25 December 1890, Noël Sullivan was the son of Alice Phelan and Francis "Frank" J. Sullivan whose father, the Irish immigrant John Sullivan, had arrived in California in 1844. He was given the name Noël (French for Christmas) as he had been born on Christmas Day. He was the nephew of James D. Phelan who was a banker and politician serving as mayor of San Francisco and Senator.
Sullivan was brought up in an affluent, influential home, attending first St. Ignatius College and then Santa Clara College. Although not academically inclined, he was interested in music, developing his singing talents abroad and performing as an amateur singer. For a time, he had a home in Paris. In World War I he served with the American Field Service as an ambulance driver. During this period, he wrote a number of letters to his aunt, Mary Louise Phelan (1896–1930).
Adult life.
Following serious problems with his father's health, in 1925 Sullivan returned to San Francisco to take care of him in the family home on 2323 Hyde Street. The house had initially been acquired by his mother for the Carmelite nuns who later moved to Santa Clara. He lived in the house for many years, frequently entertaining friends from the world of art and literature. He developed an excellent relationship with his household staff, most of whom were African Americans. These included his housekeeper, his cook and his chauffeur. He later was a supporter of Langston Hughes.
In the early 1930s, he supported the music scene in San Francisco, gaining a reputation as an adept amateur concert singer himself. As chairman of the California branch of the American League to Abolish Capital Punishment, he also campaigned vigorously for the abolition of capital punishment. As a result of depressed markets in the 1930s, Sullivan increasingly experienced financial difficulties despite being an heir of his wealthy uncle, James D. Phelan, who died in 1930. Sullivan had a 30-year-long friendship with actor Ramon Novarro (1899–1968). At Senator Phelan's funeral, Sullivan accompanied at the organ Novarro, who sang. Richard Halliburton, a family friend, was in attendance.
Sullivan maintained close relationships to his family. After the death of his married sister Gladys S. Doyle in 1933, he helped bring up her five children. As a result of his strong affection for his sister Ada, a Carmelite nun known as Agnes of Jesus, he provided support for the monasteries in Santa Clara, Carmel and San Diego while establishing an additional community in Berkeley.
From 1939, Sullivan lived in Hollow Hills Farms in Carmel Valley where he continued to entertain his artistic friends as well as participating in the Carmel Bach Festivals. He also played the organ at the Carmel Mission and headed the Carmel Music Society.
Sullivan died of a heart attack in Carmel Valley on 15 September 1956. He is buried in the Carmelite Monastery Cemetery.

Freaky Friday (song)

"Freaky Friday" is a song recorded by American rapper Lil Dicky, featuring guest vocals from American singer Chris Brown and uncredited vocals from Ed Sheeran, DJ Khaled, and Kendall Jenner. Written by Dicky, Brown, Ammo, Nicholas Audino and produced by DJ Mustard, Benny Blanco and Twice as Nice, it was released by Dirty Burd on March 15, 2018, alongside its music video. 
The song became Lil Dicky's most successful single. It peaked at number eight on the "Billboard" Hot 100. Outside of the United States, "Freaky Friday" topped the charts in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, Belgium (Wallonia), Canada, Denmark, and the Republic of Ireland.
Composition.
"Freaky Friday" is a comedy hip hop song featuring a pop-rap light-synthed DJ Mustard and Benny Blanco production.
Lil Dicky, not having released anything for three years before this single, wanted to prove himself to release the best song he could've done, and after that the concept of the song came to him, he decided to realize it with Chris Brown, being considered by him to be the best example of a superstar he would have liked to collaborate with, and the singer was welcomed to complete the song.
Storyline.
In the song the artists comically take up the concept of the novel that goes by the same name, swapping their bodies, namely that of a charismatic and controversial superstar (Chris Brown), and that of an emerging artist with a basic life (Lil Dicky).
In the song Dicky is euphoric waking up being Brown, and rejoices because he is rich, handsome, famous, surrounded by beautiful girls and able to sing and dance. Going crazy off his euphoria he calls Kanye West to tell him that he is his biggest fan, and then he realizes that he has a daughter. Meanwhile, Brown in Dicky's body is still dissatisfied with the mediocrity of his life, but he's pleased by the fact that no one judges him in a racist way, due to him being African American or due to the controversies of his past. Subsequently Dicky in Chris' body goes crazy to another level, being exalted by his attractive sexual performances, he posts photos of his penis on the Internet, and when the real Chris sees them starts looking desperately for him, finding him in the private location of a nightclub. He bursts and threatens him, but Dicky warns him that beating him would only mean hurting himself, making him realize that he loves himself, that being the key for both to go back into each others' bodies.
Music video.
The music video parodies the 2003 remake of the Lindsay Lohan film "Freaky Friday" and features cameos from Jimmy Tatro, Ed Sheeran, DJ Khaled and Kendall Jenner. As of April 2021, the video has over 665 million views on YouTube. The video shows Lil Dicky at a Chinese restaurant, similar to the 2003 film, "Freaky Friday", where a character is at a Chinese restaurant and wishes she was somebody else. In the music video, Lil Dicky is approached by a fan, played by Jimmy Tatro, who mentions he is a fan of his work. He then says to his girlfriend who he is accompanied by that he is a comedic rapper, who is not that impressive of a rapper. Lil Dicky then says to himself he wishes he was somebody who could dance, and who had credibility. The camera then pans to Chris Brown on television, mentioning he wishes he was somebody else as well. The Chinese waiter takes note of it, and gives Lil Dicky a fortune cookie. The video then shows Lil Dicky, supposedly in the body of Chris, and vice versa. The song illustrates the two in each other's bodies. Towards the end, the two are about to fight, and they realize they should not kill each other, and instead love each other. They realize that this will set them back to their original form. The video then ends with cameos from Ed Sheeran, DJ Khaled and Kendall Jenner, where Lil Dicky is then in possession in all of their bodies.
Controversy.
Shortly after the song's release, the Virginia Tech Hokies women's lacrosse team was heavily scrutinized after members of the team uploaded a video of themselves singing along to Chris Brown's verse, where he (supposedly as Lil Dicky in his body) starts saying "What up my n****" to everyone he encounters. Virginia Tech coach John Sung later apologized on behalf of the team, saying it was a "teachable moment" for the players and that "no malice was involved... They just thought they were just singing along to a song".

Sun–Liu territorial dispute

The Sun–Liu territorial dispute was a military conflict between the warlords Sun Quan and Liu Bei in 215 during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. While Sun Quan and Liu Bei had initially formed an alliance in 208 against their common rival Cao Cao, both sides got into a territorial dispute over the territories in southern Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) in the early 210s. The dispute ended when both sides agreed to divide the territories along the Xiang River between their respective domains: Sun Quan took the lands east of the river while Liu Bei kept those west of the river. Despite a peaceful settlement to the territorial dispute, Sun Quan ultimately sent his forces to attack Liu Bei's territories in an invasion in 219 and succeeded in capturing all of them.
Background.
In the winter of 208, the warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan formed an alliance to counter another warlord Cao Cao and defeated him at the decisive Battle of Red Cliffs. Shortly after the Battle of Red Cliffs, the allied forces followed up with the Battle of Jiangling and succeeded in capturing Jiangling County and the rest of Nan Commandery (南郡; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei) from Cao Cao's forces.
After the Battle of Jiangling, Nan Commandery remained under the control of Sun Quan, who appointed his general Zhou Yu as the commandery's administrator. The commandery's administrative centre was at Jiangling County and its jurisdiction included the counties of Xiajun (下雋; northwest of present-day Tongcheng County, Hubei), Hanchang (漢昌; southeast of present-day Pingjiang County, Hunan), Liuyang and Zhouling (州陵; northeast of present-day Honghu, Hubei).
In the meantime, Liu Bei nominated Liu Qi, the elder son of Jing Province's former governor Liu Biao, to succeed his father as the new governor. At the same time, he led his forces to attack and conquer the four commanderies further south in Jing Province: Wuling (武陵; around present-day Changde, Hunan), Changsha, Guiyang (桂陽; around present-day Chenzhou, Hunan) and Lingling (零陵; around present-day Yongzhou, Hunan).
After Liu Qi died in late 209, Sun Quan nominated Liu Bei to replace Liu Qi as the new governor of Jing Province. Liu Bei then made Gong'an County the administrative centre of his territories. To further strengthen the Sun–Liu alliance, he also married Sun Quan's younger sister, Lady Sun.
Sun Quan "lending" Jing Province to Liu Bei.
In 210, Liu Bei travelled to Jing (京; present-day Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) to meet Sun Quan and request to govern Nan Commandery. During this time, Zhou Yu secretly wrote to Sun Quan, urging his lord to lure Liu Bei to Wu Commandery (around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu), distract him with luxuries and women, and keep him separated from his generals Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. Sun Quan, however, rejected Zhou Yu's idea because he considered Cao Cao to be a much greater threat to him than Liu Bei, so it would be better for him to maintain his alliance with Liu Bei.
Lu Su, another of Sun Quan's generals, advised his lord to "lend" Nan Commandery to Liu Bei so as to strengthen the Sun–Liu alliance against Cao Cao. He pointed out that since they had just recently occupied Nan Commandery, they would not be able to defend it well if Cao Cao's forces attacked, so it would be better to "lend" it to Liu Bei and let him serve as a buffer against Cao Cao. Sun Quan agreed with Lu Su and "lent" Nan Commandery to Liu Bei.
Zhou Yu died later that year in Baqiu (巴丘; present-day Yueyang, Hunan) while preparing for a campaign to conquer Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), also known as Shu (蜀), from its governor Liu Zhang. Before his death, he wrote to Sun Quan to recommend Lu Su to succeed him as the commander of Sun Quan's forces in Jing Province. Sun Quan approved and put Lu Su in charge of the troops and territories which used to be led and governed by Zhou Yu.
Between 212 and 214, Liu Bei embarked on a campaign to seize control of Yi Province from Liu Zhang. He left his general Guan Yu behind to guard his territories in Jing Province during his absence.
The conflict.
At the time, tensions were rising at the Sun–Liu border in Jing Province as both sides became more suspicious and wary of each other. Around July 215, Sun Quan asked Liu Bei to "return" three commanderies in southern Jing Province – Changsha, Lingling (零陵; around present-day Yongzhou, Hunan) and Guiyang (桂陽; around present-day Chenzhou, Hunan) – since the latter already had a new base in Yi Province. When Liu Bei refused, Sun Quan decided to seize the three commanderies by force. He stationed himself at Lukou (陸口; at Lushui Lake near present-day Chibi, Hubei) while ordering Lü Meng, Ling Tong and Lü Dai to lead troops to attack the three commanderies, and Lu Su to lead 10,000 troops to Yiyang to block Guan Yu.
Lü Meng capturing the three commanderies.
Lü Meng wrote to the administrators of the three commanderies to ask them to submit to Sun Quan. All of them agreed except Lingling's administrator, Hao Pu (郝普). In the meantime, upon learning of Sun Quan's advances, Liu Bei returned from Yi Province to Gong'an County and ordered Guan Yu to lead troops to stop Lü Meng and take back the three commanderies. After hearing that Guan Yu and his army was heading their way, Sun Quan sent an urgent order to Lü Meng, ordering him to give up on Lingling and lead his troops to Yiyang to assist Lu Su.
When Lü Meng pacified Changsha, he passed by Ling County (酃縣; east of present-day Hengyang, Hunan) and met Deng Xuanzhi (鄧玄之), an old friend of Hao Pu. He planned to use Deng Xuanzhi to trick Hao Pu into surrendering. That night, Lü Meng summoned all his officers and gave them instructions on how to attack Lingling the following morning, without telling them that Sun Quan had given orders for them to give up on Lingling and move to Yiyang. He lied to Deng Xuanzhi that Liu Bei was besieged in Hanzhong by Cao Cao's general Xiahou Yuan and that Guan Yu was occupied in a battle at Nan Commandery. He then asked Deng Xuanzhi to help him persuade Hao Pu to give up on Lingling. Deng Xuanzhi went to see Hao Pu later and conveyed Lü Meng's message. Hao Pu became afraid when he heard that he had been isolated, so he agreed to surrender and asked Deng Xuanzhi to lead him to Lü Meng. When Lü Meng met Hao Pu, he revealed the truth, clapped his hands and laughed. Hao Pu became wrecked with guilt when he learnt that both Liu Bei and Guan Yu were actually free to reinforce Lingling but it was too late. Lü Meng left Sun He (孫河) behind to guard the three commanderies while he headed towards Yiyang per Sun Quan's order.
Standoff at Yiyang between Guan Yu and Gan Ning.
In the meantime, Guan Yu claimed to be leading an army of 30,000. He selected 5,000 of his best troops, led them to the upstream shallows located some 10 "li" away from Yiyang, and planned to cross the shallows at night. Lu Su held a discussion with his subordinates on how to deal with Guan Yu. At the time, Gan Ning, who had only 300 men under him, told Lu Su: "If you give me another 500 troops, I will go to confront Guan Yu. I assure you that Guan Yu will not dare to cross the waters when he hears of my approach. But if he does, I will capture him." Lu Su then chose 1,000 troops and put them under Gan Ning's command. Gan Ning headed towards Guan Yu's position at night. As Gan Ning expected, Guan Yu did not cross the shallows and instead ordered his men to make camp there. That place was thus named 'Guan Yu's Shallows' (關羽瀨).
Negotiations between Lu Su and Guan Yu.
Lu Su invited Guan Yu to attend a meeting to discuss the dispute. During the negotiations, both sides stationed their soldiers more than 100 paces away from the meeting area, while the officers present at the talks were each armed with nothing more than a sword or blade weapon. This event is hence sometimes referred to as "attending a meeting armed with only a sword" (單刀赴會).
Lu Su told Guan Yu: Before Lu Su could finish what he was saying, an unnamed person interrupted him: "Whoever has the ability to govern the land shall have control over it. Isn't it so?" Lu Su angrily rebuked that person in a firm and stern tone. Guan Yu drew his sword, stood up and said: "This is a state-level problem. We can't hope to understand it." He left after that.
Wei Zhao's "Book of Wu" (吳書) provided more details on the meeting. Before the talks started, Lu Su's subordinates feared that Guan Yu would try to harm Lu Su, so they advised Lu Su against attending the meeting. However, Lu Su replied: "It's better for us to settle this dispute in a peaceful manner. Liu Bei may have acted against our lord's interests, but we haven't agreed on who is right and who is wrong. Do you think Guan Yu will dare to do something as rash as killing me at this point in time?"
Lu Su then met Guan Yu, who told him: 
Lu Su replied: Guan Yu did not respond to what Lu Su said.
Peaceful settlement.
Although the talks between Lu Su and Guan Yu were inconclusive, the Sun–Liu territorial dispute ultimately ended by the end of August 215 when Liu Bei decided to give in upon learning that his base in Yi Province was potentially under threat. This was because Cao Cao was attacking Hanzhong Commandery, then under the control of the warlord Zhang Lu. As Hanzhong was the "northern gateway" of Yi Province, if Cao Cao succeeded in seizing Hanzhong from Zhang Lu, he would be able to launch attacks on Yi Province from Hanzhong. Liu Bei thus decided that it was better for him to make peace with Sun Quan at the moment, and shift his focus towards countering Cao Cao. Liu Bei and Sun Quan then withdrew their forces after agreeing to divide the territories in southern Jing Province between their respective domains along the Xiang River: Liu Bei would keep Nan, Lingling and Wuling commanderies in the west, while Sun Quan would take Changsha, Jiangxia and Guiyang commanderies in the east.
Aftermath.
Although the Sun–Liu territorial dispute of 215 ended in a peace settlement, Sun Quan did not give up his goal of acquiring all of Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province. In the winter of 219–220, when Guan Yu was away at the Battle of Fancheng against Cao Cao's forces in northern Jing Province, Sun Quan ordered Lü Meng to lead a stealth invasion of Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province. Lü Meng and his army succeeded in their mission and conquered all of Liu Bei's territories without Guan Yu knowing. By the time Guan Yu returned from Fancheng, it was already too late. Guan Yu was subsequently captured in an ambush and executed by Sun Quan's forces after refusing to surrender.
In "Romance of the Three Kingdoms".
In Chapter 66 of the 14th-century historical novel "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", the meeting between Guan Yu and Lu Su is dramatised into an event known as "Guan Yunchang (Guan Yu) attending a meeting armed with only a blade" (). In the novel, the meeting is actually a mask for an attempt by Lu Su and his subordinates to force Guan Yu to hand over Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province to Sun Quan's side. Their plan is as follows: Lu Su will pretend to invite Guan Yu to attend a meeting and demand that he "return" the territories. Lü Meng, Gan Ning and the others will lead their men to hide near the meeting area. If Guan Yu refuses to hand over the territories, Lu Su will give a signal for them to immediately come out of hiding and assassinate Guan Yu. Guan Yu knows that it is a trap but he still arms himself with only his Green Dragon Crescent Blade and attends the meeting. After a short exchange with Lu Su over a few drinks, Guan Yu senses the hidden danger so he pretends to be drunk, grabs Lu Su and holds him hostage while carefully retreating back to his boat. He releases Lu Su after boarding his boat and sails back to his base safely.

Alin Pânzaru

Alin Cristinel Pânzaru (born 18 January 1976) is a Romanian former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. Pânzaru made his Liga I debut on 4 December 1993, for Oțelul Galați in a 1-1 draw against Inter Sibiu. In his first 9 years of career Pânzaru played mainly for teams from Galați such as: Oțelul Galați, Dunărea Galați or Constant CFR Galați. In 2003 he signed a contract with FC Vaslui, then playing for FC Gloria Buzău and the Moldovan side Zimbru Chișinău. In 2007 he moved to Oțelul Galați and Dunărea Galați bitter rival, Dacia Unirea Brăila, named CF Brăila at that time, and played there in more than 100 matches, until his retirement in 2012.
In 2012, after retirement, Pânzaru started immediately his football manager career at his last club as a player Dacia Unirea Brăila.
Trivia.
During the 2017–18 Liga II season he was the protagonist of a controversial moment, when he accused Gabriel Iosofache and Costel Roșu, two of the club players, of match fixing. Dacia Unirea was already in the middle of some media speculations at that moment due to some results with frequent score changes, such as: 2-3 (ASU Politehnica Timișoara), 4-4 (Știința Miroslava), 4-3 (Luceafărul Oradea), 2-3 (Olimpia Satu Mare), 3-4 (UTA Arad) or 3-3 (Pandurii Târgu Jiu). The rumors were also relied on the poor financial situation of the team, with some outstanding salaries of almost a year, the big scandal born at Luceafărul Oradea after the match against Brăila, when the owner of the club retired, the coach suspected his players of being involved in the betting mafia and finally the club being close to implosion and also Dacia Unirea's matches started to disappear from the betting offer.

Consolidated Land and Rail Australia

Consolidated Land and Rail Australia (trading as CLARA) is a property development consortium proposing a high speed rail network for the Australian east coast that would funded by the development of new smart cities along the route. The company began operations in 2015, and in 2018 was one of three proposals invited to develop a detailed business case with federal government funding. The proposal attracted significant media attention for what was perceived as a radically different approach from previous attempts at introducing high-speed rail in Australia.
History.
Following the release of the Phase 2 report in late 2015, businessman Nick Cleary began taking options on land along the proposed route of the high-speed rail line. However, he found that the land was already mostly subdivided and therefore prohibitively complex and expensive to acquire. As such, Cleary shifted his focus to greenfields land outside the major existing regional centres. He did not inform landowners the details of his intentions, instead telling them that he represented a "major infrastrcture project".
The domain name clara.com.au was registered by investment banker Geoff Moore in October 2015, and the website was activated with only "coming soon" placeholders. In March 2016, a scheduled appointment between CLARA and the office of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was reported by media outlets, along with rumours that the meeting would discuss a proposal for a high speed railway line between Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. "The Age" reported that the company was based in Melbourne, and was apparently unrelated to any other major Australian companies, although it appeared to be backed by an American infrastructure investor. Federal MP John Alexander emerged as a supporter of the plan, explaining that it was based on a "value capture" funding model including the purchase of regional land along the route.
The CLARA plan was officially launched in Melbourne on 13 July, with chairman Nick Cleary announcing that deals had been finalised for the purchase of land on which to situate 8 new railway stations and greenfield property developments, following 12 months of negotiations. The announcement followed discussions with officials from the Victorian and NSW governments conducted throughout April. At the event, former Premier of New South Wales Barry O'Farrell and former Premier of Victoria Steve Bracks spoke in favour of the proposal, revealing that the project was backed by former American infrastructure planners. By the end of 2016, however, a managing director of CLARA had resigned, and O'Farrell and Bracks had resigned from the advisory committee.
The announcement of the proposal also revealed that the preferred transport option was a maglev system, able to reach Shepparton from Melbourne in 30 minutes, and Sydney in under two hours. However, financial details of the plan were not released, with the company's directors describing the complete funding model as commercial-in-confidence.
In October, Cleary presented a speech to the Australian Property Council, stating that construction on the rail line could begin by 2021. Later that month, the CLARA proposal was presented to a federal parliamentary committee (chaired by John Alexander) alongside a competing Hyperloop One proposal, which differed substantially from the CLARA model by gearing its service towards existing regional centres. Cleary suggested that the CLARA model could be constructed using Hyperloop technology, but a Hyperloop spokesperson rejected the suggestion, stating that the plans were not compatible. At the same time, Cleary publicly announced that the ACT government had not entered into discussions regarding a spur line to Canberra.
The parliamentary committee handed down its findings in February 2017, recommending that the government actively seek privately-funded proposals for a Melbourne-Sydney high speed rail link. Meanwhile, shadow infrastructure minister Anthony Albanese introduced a private member's bill to the parliament, calling for a dedicated High Speed Rail Planning Authority to be established by the federal government.
During the second half of 2017, CLARA met with councils along the route, encouraging them to support the project for the benefits it would bring to local government areas. Geoff Kettle, a former mayor of Goulburn Mulwaree Council in New South Wales, led the consultation process, stating that although CLARA had acquired rights to around 50% of the total land required, the remaining portion would become increasingly expensive to obtain because of development. Five councils ultimately provided written support to the CLARA proposal following the process.
At the end of October, CLARA announced it had assembled a consortium of 13 companies to lead planning and construction of the project, including Hitachi, Cardno, the federal government's CSIRO, DLA Piper and other smaller design and construction companies, as well as PwC to oversee the financial modelling for the plan. At the same time, its plan was placed under consideration for a $20 million federal government grant to facilitate the development of a business case, while competing proposals from other companies and Transport for NSW were announced.
The federal government announced that the CLARA proposal had been granted public funding to continue developing its business case on 9 March 2018, along with two other proposals in different states. One competing proposal, from the NSW government, is for a line between Sydney and Newcastle, while the second, from a Queensland-based consortium, proposes a line from Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast.
Funding model.
Value capture is a model of investment which relies on recouping some of the increase in value of an asset over time. In the case of CLARA, the primary source of this income is the increased land value in areas surrounding the stations along the high speed rail line.
This funding model has been compared to the development of railroads in the United States, where private companies constructed railroads on land purchased from governments, and recouped the investment from the construction of towns needed to service and operate the line.
Proposed rail network.
The route identified by CLARA extends from Melbourne to Sydney via Shepparton and Canberra. The consortium has proposed that sections from Melbourne to Shepparton and Sydney to Canberra be constructed first to prove the route's viability.
Although no specific rail technology has been identified by CLARA, it indicated to stakeholders that any tracks would be elevated, minimising the impact on landowners. In addition, the consortium claimed that its specific planned route was largely similar to the corridor identified by Infrastructure Australia.
Analysis and criticism.
Expert opinion on the CLARA plan on its initial launch was largely critical of its funding model, and focused on the ability of the rail line to compete with the established and extensive air travel market, especially that between Melbourne and Sydney. Engineering groups noted that the complexities of developing a high-speed rail route from scratch and the enormous capital expenditure required for construction had deterred previous proposals and were not addressed by the CLARA plan.
Paddy Manning, writing in "The Monthly", observed that while the details of the plan were scant, and the likelihood of its success generating new regional cities were minimal, the activities of CLARA had found support in regional Australia because they offered hope for failing regional economies. However, he also noted that CLARA was one of many proposals for high-speed rail links along the eastern seaboard both past and present, and faced enormous challenges working with governments to even commence construction.
Similarly, a report by "Foreground", the publishing arm of the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects, concluded that the radical CLARA plan was unlikely to find support from government because of the political issues inherent in prioritising the development of new regional centres over existing towns and cities. The report further noted that obtaining a reliable water supply for new population centres in inland Australia would be a major difficulty.

Medieval Russian army

The Medieval Russian army, from the foundation of Kievan Rus' till the reforms of Ivan the Terrible, can be roughly divided into the Kievan Rus' period, between the 9th to 13th century, mainly characterized by infantry armies of town militia that were supported by Druzhina cavalry; and the feudal period from 1240 to 1550, which was distinguished by cavalry armies of noble militia and their armed servants.
Before the Mongol invasion.
Tribal militia formed the basis of the army in Kievan Rus' until the tax reform of Olga of Kiev in the middle of the 10th century. In the subsequent period, under Svyatoslav I of Kiev and Vladimir the Great, Druzhina played a dominant role. It consisted of senior members – the boyars – along with the rank-and-file ‘youths’ ("otroki").
The regiments of city militia, raised by the decision of the Veche, were formed in the 11th century. These regiments received weapons and horses for a campaign from the prince.
Tactics and equipment.
Before Mongol invasion of Rus' in the 13th century, a Prince would be accompanied by his Druzhina, a small retinue of heavy cavalry, who would often fight dismounted (eq. Battle on the Ice). Massively heavy armor was used, mostly Scandinavian-style. However, these squads, as a rule, did not exceed the number of several hundred men, and were unsuitable for united actions under a single command.
At the same time, the main part of the Kievan Rus' army was the militia infantry. It was inferior to Druzhina in armament and the ability to own it. The militia used axes and hunting spears ("rogatina"). Swords were rarely used, and they had no armor other than plain clothes and fur hats.
For the infantry, consisted of poorly armed peasants and tradesmen, numbers are uncertain. The only specific numbers mentioned for the Russians are 1.700 men of Evpaty Kolovrat(The Tale of the Destruction of Ryazan) and 3.000, men under Voivode Dorozh (Battle of the Sit River). However, these were exceptionally large numbers for Russian standards at the time. In 1242, Prince Alexander Nevski in Novgorod could muster no more than 1.000 Druzhina and 2.000 militia for the Battle on the Ice. So, it is safe to estimate that, on average, a Russian Prince had hundreds of warriors in his retinue, rather than thousands.
Mongol invasions.
After Mongol invasion of Rus' many independent principalities were destroyed. Remaining petty states were under growing pressure from Tatars, Sweden and Lithuania. Constant warfare precipitated the development of feudalism, and diminished the importance of the Veche. The feudal militia, raised by the Boyars-landowners and individual Princes, came to replace popular militia. Princes (except in the Novgorod Republic) gathered and commanded the army.
In the second half of the 14th century, Druzhina was replaced by feudally organized units headed by Boyars or dependent Princes, and these units consisted of landed gentry (so called ""Boyar's children" or "service people"") and their armed servants ("military slaves"). In the 15th century, such organization of detachments replaced the city regiments.
Landed Army.
The process of reforming the army was associated with the unification of the Russian lands in the 15th century. Gradually, the Grand Duchy of Moscow included new petty princedoms, courts of independent princes were dismissed, and "service people" passed to the Grand Duke. As a result, the vassal Princes and Boyars were transformed into state servants, who received estates for service in conditional holding (less often - in fiefdom). Thus, the "landed army" "(") was formed, the bulk of which were noblemen and "Boyar's children", with their armed slaves. This army organization would remain unchanged till 1550 (military reforms of Ivan the Terrible).
When the centralized state was formed, the people's militia was liquidated by the Grand Prince of Moscow. The prince called the masses to military service only in the event of serious military danger, regulating the extent and nature of this service at his own discretion.
Tactics and equipment.
 During the period of the Mongol invasions, Russia adopted much of Mongol military tactics and organization. While militia infantry still existed, they were, from XIV onward, mostly armed with ranged weapons, and delegated auxiliary duties, such as defending cities. The chronicles describe the Muscovites using arquebuses against the Tatars in 1480. The men shooting these weapons were the forerunners of the Streltsy.
The bulk of the army were mounted archers, who included Boyars, landed gentry ("Boyars' children") and armed slaves.
Under Tatar influence, the mail and lamellar armour of Kievan Rus' was replaced with brigandine "("Kuyak")", mail and plate "("Behterets")" and mirror armour"("Zertsalo")", while poor noblemen and armed serfs wore long aketons "("Tyegilyai")."

X-Road

X-Road is a "centrally managed distributed Data Exchange Layer (DXL) between information systems". Organizations can exchange information over the Internet using X-Road to ensure confidentiality, integrity and interoperability between data exchange parties.
The first X-Road iteration was developed and launched by Estonia's Information System Authority (RIA) in 2001. The source codes of its central components were released on October 3, 2016 under an MIT License. By February 7, 2018, Finland's and Estonia's data exchange layers were connected to one another. In 2017 Finland and Estonia established the Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS) to continue the development of the X-Road core.
Features.
According to their web page, "The X-Road is an open source data exchange layer solution that enables organizations to exchange information over the Internet. The X-Road is a centrally managed distributed integration layer between Information Systems that provides a standardized and secure way to produce and consume services. The X-Road ensures confidentiality, integrity and interoperability between data exchange parties."
History.
X-Road was started in 1998 as a pilot project under Ministry of Economy and Communications and first prototype was publicly presented in 2000. One of the main reasons behind architectural choice of distributed data storage was massive data leak of 1996, where government contractor and computer specialist Imre Perli created and marketed a "superdatabase" containing personal data from various government sources.
The Information System Authority (RIA) at the Ministry of Economy and Communications, developed X-Road and launched the first version in 2001 and holds the registered trademark, X-Road.
On October 28, 2014 the government of Namibia entered into a two-year agreement with the to implement a data exchange layer based on the X-Road technology.
On October 3, 2016 the source code of central components of X-Road was released under an MIT License.
February 7, 2018, Finland's and Estonia's data exchange layers were connected to one another. X-Road is used nationwide in the Estonian public administration (X-tee) and in the Suomi.fi Data Exchange Layer (Suomi.fi-palveluväylä) service. X-Road has built-in support for connecting two X-Road ecosystems with each other which enables a native cross-border data exchange between Estonia and Finland.
Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS).
The Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS) was founded jointly in June 2017 by Finland and Estonia, with a mission "to develop e-governance solutions...with the X-Road technology used nationwide in the Estonian X-tee and in the Finnish Suomi.fi Data Exchange Layer services".
The NIIS manages, develops, verifies, and audits X-Road's source code; administers documentation, business and technical requirements; conducts development; develops and implements principles of licensing and distribution; provides second-line support for members, and engages in international cooperation.
X-Road and blockchain.
By April 2018, a number of articles erroneously stated that X-Road is a "blockchain-based technology or it utilizes blockchain internally". According to an April 18, 2018 article by Petteri Kivimäki the CTO of the Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS), "There is no blockchain technology in the X-Road." Kivimäki "was the technical lead of X-Road implementation project in Finland and was coordinating the joint open source development of the X-Road solution between Finland and Estonia."

Paris Book of Customs

The Paris Book of Customs is a "Sefer Minhagim" (book of religious customs) and the oldest illustrated Yiddish-language book. Completed in or before 1503, it consists of 121 folios, of which 94 are illustrated. The style of the illustrations and the language used indicates it was most likely created by in Italy. Originally owned by a single family, presumably Ashkenazi immigrants from Germany or Austria, the book came into the possession of Cardinal Richelieu some time after 1632 and was stored at the Sorbonne before being moved to the Bibliothèque nationale de France, where it is currently stored as Ms. Héb 586.
Written in "clear, concise language", the book was intended for a middle class family as a reference work for religious practice. Illustrations include the arrest of Gedaliah, the stoning of Amalek and a celebration after Tisha B'Av. The text itself was largely copied from the "Sefer HaMinhagim" of Isaac Tyrnau.

WhyEurope

WhyEurope is a non-partisan and independent non-profit organization, which was founded in 2016 in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany. It aims at highlighting the benefit of the European Union for an average citizen in their daily lives by adopting an innovative communication style. Since September 2017, WhyEurope e.V. is an officially registered association based in Tübingen, Germany. It has approximately 30 members from over 10 European states.
Background and History.
The initiative was founded by the three students, who shared a concern about the rise of euroscepticism and right-wing-populism. The outcome of the Brexit referendum was the trigger for them to become active. They decided to publish pictures with simple pro-European messages on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
Communication Style.
WhyEurope has adopted a communication style they refer to as “Positive Populism”. The founders describe the approach as simple, emotional and personal. They refrain from including difficult, political or legal terms in their slogans and make their messages as catchy and short as possible. Furthermore, WhyEurope aims to trigger positive emotions by connecting political issues to every-day topics such as love or happiness. The initiative aims at pointing out the concrete advantages complex benefits of European integration have in people's daily lives. The founders have repeatedly stated that "Positive Populism" is to be seen as a simple and emotional communication style, but sustains a foundation of hard facts and evidence. In contrary to actual ‘negative’ populists, they want to provide factual evidence and explanations for their claims.
WhyEurope considers Positive Populism an approach to oppose current populist and extremist movements. According to them, the technical communication of the European Union might have contributed to the lack of support those institutions have received during the past years. Adopting a more appealing communication approach might help the Union to regain confidence.
Independence.
Since their foundation, WhyEurope has always emphasized their character as a non-partisan and independent initiative. Despite being in contact with actors of the European Union, they have repeatedly stated their distance to the EU institutions. They refuse to accept any financial support in any form from the European Union and other political institutions or actors.
Relationship to other initiatives.
WhyEurope has had a number of cooperations with other pro-European initiatives. Since beginning of 2016, Benedikt Kau and Hans-Christoph Schlüter were in contact with and Sabine Röder when they launched the demonstrations under the name Pulse of Europe. Pulse of Europe adopted the campaign and the slogan of the campaign “Blijf bij ons” focusing on the . Together, the initiatives mobilized ten thousands of people joining pro-European demonstrations.
Further cooperations included projects with the Young European Federalists and Laute Europäer.
Reception.
On 31 January, Marine Le Pen (Front National) filed a parliamentary request in the European Parliament asking about the funding of WhyEurope through the European Commission. Commissioner Günther Oettinger, then responsible person for the EU budget, replied that the Commission has not funded WhyEurope in any way and the name were not found within the central accounting system.
November 2017, WhyEurope has been awarded "European Public Communication Award" by the European Committee Of The Regions. The prize was received during the EuroPCom in the hemicycle of the European Parliament.
In May 2018, WhyEurope has been awarded the by the Association of Liberal Academics in Germany.

Norman (horse)

Norman (also known as Norman III, 1905 – after 1918) was an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was exported from the United States as a yearling and showed some promise as a juvenile in 1907 when he won twice from nine starts. In the following spring he recorded a 25/1 upset victory in the 2000 Guineas. He was unplaced when favourite for the Epsom Derby and finished last in the St Leger but ended his second season with a victory in the Newmarket St Leger. He raced for another two seasons but never recaptured his classic winning form. He made no impact as a breeding stallion.
Background.
Norman was a bay horse bred in the United States by his American owner August Belmont Jr. Like several major American owners Belmont had moved most of his hoses to Europe following the passing of the Hart–Agnew Law. The colt was sent to England as a yearling and entered training with John Watson at the Palace House stable in Newmarket in Suffolk.
Both of Norman's parents were bred and owned by Belmont. He was sired by the Kentucky-bred stallion Octagon whose wins included the Toboggan Handicap, Withers Stakes and Brooklyn Derby. His dam Nineveh was a descendant of the broodmare Mildred, making her a relative of Kalitan and Souffle (Kentucky Oaks).
Racing career.
1907: two-year-old season.
Norman ran nine times as a two-year-old in 1907. He won two races, including the Exeter Stakes, and finished third twice. When tried against top-class opposition in the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in October he finished unplaced behind the filly Rhodora.
1908: three-year-old season.
On 6 May 1908 Norman started a 25/1 outsider against sixteen opponents for the 100th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. Ridden by Otto Madden he upset the odds as he took the lead in the last quarter mile and drew away to win "easily" by three lengths clear of Sir Archibald with White Eagle three quarters of a length back in third. The result of the race saw Norman promoted to the position of favourite for the Epsom Derby.
In the Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 3 June Norman started the 11/2 favourite and was againpartneed by Madden. He was in second place at half way but then faded out of contention and finished fifteenth of the eighteen runners behind the 100/1 outsider Signorinetta. In September he was fancied to run well in the St Leger but made no impact as he came home last of the ten runners behind Your Majesty. In October, the colt returned to winning form when he took the Newmarket St Leger over one and three-quarter miles.
Later career.
Norman remained in training for at least two more years but failed to win any more major races. In March 1910 he finished third behind Cinderella and Forerunerr in the Lincolnshire Handicap. Later that month he a second when favourite for the Newark Plate at Nottingham Racecourse.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Norman a "poor" winner of the 2000 Guineas.
Stud record.
After his retirement from racing Norman was exported to become a breeding stallion at the Abony Stud in Hungary. He had no success as a sire of winners.

There are many children of businessmen, university professors, and doctors in classmates, and topics of classes extend to ski areas, cinemas, Ginza, and summer resorts. Koperu experiences and observes various events in school life with friends. Following each chapter, the uncle who told the story of the day talked about themes such as "view of things", "structure of society", "relation", etc. in the style of a note written to Koperu.
In the end, Koperu writes a decision on his future way of living as a reply to his uncle, and the novel ends with the narrator asking the question "how do you live?" to the reader.
Publication.
This book is one of the "Nihon Shosan Bunko" series that intended to convey knowledge and ideas of free and progressive culture to school children in Japan. However, many of the works were discouraged by the rise of Japanese militarism in 1930s.

Takada focused on the privileged family environment and the high "social class" of the heroes. Those were drawn by the author, who was inspired by the people during his time at Takashi Associated Junior High School (now a high school attached to the University of Tsukuba). He pointed out that this book is meant to call out to the person, a human being capable of a self-living way (that is, educated) was then a limited number of privileged boys at the time.

Carly Motors

Carly Motors is a Dutch motorsports company. Carly Motors started tuning racing engines but grew into one of the top teams of the European Touring Car Championship and the Guia Race of Macau between 2001 and 2004.
History.
Carly Pellinkhof started her chip tuning company in 1979. Her company supported the Mercedes-Benz factory supported teams in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft. In 1992 Pellinkhof started her own racing team.
Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft.
Carly Motors ran a BMW M3 in the 1991 Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft. Entered under Marlboro BMW Dealer Team Cor Euser was the team's sole driver. Eusers best result was a thirteenth place at the Norisring.
Dutch Touring Car Championship.
Carly Motors entered four BMW 325i's in the 1992 Dutch Production Car Championship. Marcel van Vliet, Ger van Krimpen, Heikki Salmenoutio and Salvatore Santisi raced the cars in the 'over 2000cc' class. Van Vliet was the first driver to win during the season, at Circuit Zandvoort. While Team Lotus driver Tom Langeberg won the championship, Carly Motors drivers Van Vliet and Salmenoutio finished second and third.
Starting in 1997 the Dutch Touring Car Championship following Group N regulations was formed. Under the name H&amp;P Panorama Team Carly Motors started the season with Duncan Huisman and Sandor van Es. The duo dominated the inaugural season with Huisman taking the title and Van Es finishing second in the series standings. Van Es and Huisman remained at the H&amp;P Panorama Team for 1998. The team faced heavy competition, mainly from Renault. Van Es won three races and placed second in the series standings. Cor Euser returned to the team in 1999. Euser won five races and clinched the championship in the final weekend over Frans Verschuur. For 2000 the team returned to dominance with Huisman and Van Es but it was sometimes controversial. In the second round of the championship the team won both races but was later disqualified on technical grounds. During the third round of the championship Van Es was leading the race but let Huisman pass in the last round. Pellinkhof ordered Van Es to slow down to let Huisman pass. The team won nine out of thirteen races with Huisman winning the championship over Van Es. Huisman won the series championship over Van Es. In 2001 the Carly Motors built BMW's again caused controversy. Their dominance was questioned by other teams. Some of the teams wanted the organisation to add weight to the Carly Motors cars. Van Es won two races but was a constant top five finisher to clinch the championship. Teammate Tom Coronel made his debut in the series winning three races and ended fifth in the standings. In 2002 the Dutch Touring Car Championship struggled to attract a representative grid. A low point was reached in July when only nine cars started the race. The championship was won by Huisman winning nine races out of fifteen. Teammate Molenaar finished third in the championship. The duo was split by Renault works driver Jeroen Bleekemolen.
European Touring Car Championship.
With the Super Production class added to the European Touring Car Championship in 2001 Carly Motors joined the series. The team raced the championship with two BMW 320i's for Dutchman Duncan Huisman and Swede Peggen Andersson. The duo competed the full season while Carly Motors entered three other cars in selected races. Huisman started the season strong with two second place finishes, only beaten by countryman Peter Kox. Huisman won at Magny-Cours, Zolder and the Hungaroring. Huisman settled for second in the championship, behind Kox. Andersson settled for seventh in the championship with two fourth places as his best result. At the season finale at Estoril two guest drivers scored the best results for Carly Motors. Sandor van Es and Tom Coronel finished second and third, behind CiBiEmme Team driver Gianni Morbidelli.
For 2002 the Super Production, FIA Group N, became the main class of the championship, replacing Super Touring.

Guilin Park

Guilin Park () is a public park in Shanghai, China. It is located at the homonymous metro station on line 12. Line 15 will also stop here, as of 2018 being under construction.
History.
Established in 1929 as a private residence of Huang Jinrong, the park covers a total area of 35,500 square meters. In 1958 it became a public park maintained by the Shanghai Garden Management Office and it received the name Guilin Park due to the garden's osmanthus trees.
Sights.
Just like ancient Chinese gardens, it is densely decorated and planted with a vast variety of trees. This is one of the few parks in Shanghai that kept most of the aspects of traditional Chinese garden design, featuring gates, lakes, grottoes, rocks, curved paths, animal-shaped stones, stele and pavilions. Although its area is relatively small, the architecture of different parts varies, as if it were made to showcase a historical Chinese garden.
When the weather allows, nearby residents come here to play Go and Mahjong, sing or play music, do exercises, or relax lying on the meadow.
The surrounding wall separates the park from the streets and creek, making it possible to close it for the late afternoon and night. Entrance fee is 2 yuan.
Just across the street there is the larger and more modern Kangjian Park.

Monument of Glory, Samara

The Monument of Glory (, "Monument slavy") is the focal point of Slavy Square in Samara (former Kuybyshev), Russia, overlooking the Volga river to the north-west. It is dedicated to the Kuybyshev workers of aircraft industry, who were working hard during and following the Great Patriotic War. The monument is one of the most prominent symbols of Samara. Moscow sculptors Pavel Bondarenko, Oleg Kiryuhin and architect A. Samsonov created a design of the thirteen-meter-tall figure, made from high alloy steel with wings raised over his head and forty-meter pedestal. The pedestal symbolizes ray of light rising to the sky.
The monument was erected between 1968 and 1971 for donations of Kuybyshev workers and other staff members of production plants. Every worker could donate only one rouble. Kuybyshev mayor's office chose a place for the monument in the city centre in the Leninsky district. The opening ceremony took place on 5 November 1971.
Historical background.
Kuybyshev was major aircraft-industry center of the Soviet Union during the Second World War. 28,000 Ilyushin Il-2 and Ilyushin Il-10 ground-attack aircraft was made in Kuybyshev's factories No. 1 and No. 18., representing 80 per cent of inventory.

New York Hotel (Novocherkassk)

The New York Hotel () is a building in Novocherkassk, Rostov Oblast, Russia. It is officially declared as an object of cultural heritage of Russia.
History.
The building was constructed in the end of the 19th century. Before the Revolution of 1917 the facade of the house was decorated in a different way compared to how it looks now, and the interior space was distinguished by a rich interior. On the wall of the house there is a memorial plaque that read that on February 13, 1943 a red banner was set here by the soldiers of the 2nd Guards Army, when Novocherkassk was liberated from German invaders. After the end of World War II, the building housed a secondary school and later a psychoneurological dispensary. In 1992, the house was recognized as an object of cultural heritage and an architectural monument.
Architecture.
The style of the New York Hotel resembles that of many other buildings in Novocherkassk that were built in the same period, e. g. Golden Anchor Hotel. The building is located on the corner of two streets and at some time it had a strong impact on their development. The hotel was built of red brick. At the level of the second floor of the house there is an external balcony with twisted iron railing. Two-storey house with a basement was built in the Art Nouveau style. This is clearly shown by the design of the parapet, the pilaster, and by the outlook of the windows and the lattice of balconies.

Musicians Seamounts

Musicians Seamounts are a chain of seamounts in the Pacific Ocean, north of the Hawaiian Ridge. There are about 65 seamounts, some of which are named after musicians. These seamounts exist in two chains, one of which has been attributed to a probably now-extinct hotspot called the Euterpe hotspot. Others may have formed in response to plate tectonics associated with the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the former Farallon Plate.
The seamounts were constructed on young oceanic crust during the Cretaceous, but a second phase of volcanic activity took place during the Eocene. Deep sea coral reefs occur on the seamounts.
Geography and geomorphology.
The Musicians Seamounts lie in the north-central Pacific, north of the Hawaiian Ridge north and northwest of Necker Island, extending over a length of . The seamounts were formerly known as the North Hawaiian Seamount Range and were among the first submarine mountains to be thoroughly researched.
The seamounts consist of two separate chains (one trending in north-south direction parallel to the Emperor Seamounts and the other in northwest-southeast direction parallel to the northern Line Islands) of ridges that extend east-west and seamounts. Seamounts have usually an elliptical cross section and heights of and no flat tops like other seamounts south of the Hawaiian Ridge; the highest is Liszt Seamount whose summit has a depth of . The ridges contain individual volcanoes and reach lengths of over ; in the Italian and Bach Ridges the volcanoes are high. The Musicians horst and the Southern Ridges are additional features of the Musicians Seamounts. Terrain observed by remotely operated vehicles shows large blocks, pillow lavas, flat terrain, lava flows and talus. 
The total number of seamounts is about 65, some of which Henry William Menard named after 18th century musicians. Among the seamounts known by name are:
Geology.
The Pacific Ocean floor beneath the seamounts is of Cretaceous age and is subdivided by the Murray Fracture Zone into an older northern (100 to 95 million years ago) and a younger southern (80 to 85 million years ago) sector. To the north, the Musicians Seamounts are limited by the Pioneer Fracture Zone. The Musicians Seamounts developed on crust that was no more than 20 million years old, and paleomagnetic information indicates that the seamounts were located between 0 and 10° north of the equator when they developed.
Rock samples dredged from the seamounts include basalt, hawaiite, mugearite and trachyte. Minerals contained in the rocks consist of aegirine, augite, clinopyroxene, feldspar, oxidized olivine, orthopyroxene, plagioclase and pyroxene. Calcite, clay and zeolites have formed through alteration processes, and manganese nodules have been encountered as well. The petrogenesis of Musicians Seamounts magmas has been explained by the mixing of several mantle-derived components. 
Origin.
The origin of the seamounts has been explained with either one or two hotspots of Cretaceous age. Dating of the seamounts supports a hotspot origin only for the northwest-southeast trend, however. This hotspot has been named Euterpe hotspot after Euterpe, Greek Muse of musicians. Plate reconstructions for the time period based on the dates of the northwest-southeast trend and the older Line Islands are consistent with each other. 
It is possible that their formation was influenced by the nearby presence of a spreading ridge, a process which has been suggested for other hotspots such as Réunion, Iceland, Azores and others as well. The Farallon Plate-Pacific Plate spreading ridge was located east of the Musicians Seamounts and flow from the hotspot to the ridge may have generated the east-west trending ridges of the Musicians Seamounts. 
Alternative explanations for the formation of the Musicians Seamounts is the presence of a former spreading ridge at their site, and crustal weaknesses associated with the so-called "bending line" in the region which was formed by a change in the motion of the Pacific Plate.
Geologic context.
About 10,000 seamounts and islands are estimated to dot the floor of the Pacific Ocean, forming clusters and chains. The origin of chains of seamounts and islands is commonly explained with the hotspot hypothesis, which posits that as the crust migrates above a stationary hotspot volcanism forms these structures. A further hypothesis states that the hotspots, sourced from mantle plumes, are static with respect to each other and thus geologists can reconstruct the history of plate movement by analyzing the tracks traced on the crust by hotspots.
The Pacific Ocean contains a number of seamount and island chains, some of which have been attributed to hotspots such as the Cobb hotspot, Caroline hotspot, Hawaiian hotspot, Marquesas hotspot, Tahiti hotspot, Pitcairn hotspot, Macdonald hotspot and Louisville hotspot. Not all of these hotspots are necessarily fed by a deep continuous mantle plume; some may be nourished by discrete batches of melting material that rise through the mantle. Other chains may be controlled by mantle flow towards a spreading ridge, which has been proposed for the Musicians chain.
Biology.
Deep sea corals and sponges grow on the Musicians Seamounts; corals identified include "Antipathes", "Acanthogorgia", chrysogorgidae, "Hemicorallium", isididae, "Paracalyptrophora", "Pleurogorgia" and primnoids, while sponges include "Caulophacus", "Hyalostylus", "Poliopogon" and "Saccocalyx". In some places true "coral forests" grow on the seamounts. Animal species observed on the seamounts by remotely operated vehicles include amphipods, anemones, anglerfish, arrow worms, bristlemouths, brittle stars, cephalopods, chirons, codling fish, ctenophores, crinoids, cusk eels, fangtooth fish, halosaurs, jellyfish, larvaceans, piglet squid, polychaetes, ribbon worms, sea cucumbers, sea elephants, sea pens, sea spiders, sea stars, shrimp, siphonophores, spider crabs, squat lobsters, urchins and zoanthids.
Eruptive history.
The Musicians Seamounts were active during the Late Cretaceous. Ages obtained on some seamounts range from 96 million years ago for the Northwest Cluster over 94 million years ago for Hammerstein, 91 million years ago for Mahler, 90 million years ago for Brahms, 86 million years ago for Rachmaninoff, 84 million years ago for Liszt, 83 million years ago for Khatchaturian and West Schumann, 82 million years ago for West Mendelssohn, 79 million years ago for East Mendelssohn, 75 million years ago for Bach Ridge and Haydn to 65 million years ago for Paumakua. 
Based on considerations derived from plate tectonics, earlier volcanism could have occurred on the Farallon Plate, which has been subducted in its entirely and its volcanoes have now vanished. No volcanism in the Musicians Seamounts post-dating about 70 million years ago was discovered at first; either volcanism ceased at that time or it continued on the Farallon Plate again. The Euterpe hotspot is now extinct, although an unusually shallow ocean region around may be a remnant of the Euterpe hotspot.
Some of the ridges in the Musicians Seamounts have much younger ages, 53 to 52 million years ago by argon-argon dating and continuing to 48 to 47 million years ago. This volcanism occurred at the time of major changes in the motion of the Pacific Plate; stresses occurring within the plate may have reactivated the Musicians volcanoes and resulted in this late stage activity. One earthquake has been recorded in the province during historical time.

Luritja

The Luritja or Loritja people, also known as Kukatja or Kukatja-Luritja, are an Aboriginal Australian people of the Northern Territory. Their traditional lands are immediately west of the Derwent River, that forms a frontier with the Arrernte people, with their lands covering some . Their language is the Luritja dialect, a Western Desert language.
Name.
The name Kukatja or Kukatj is one shared by four other distinct tribes throughout Australia. The root of the word seems to suggest pride in being "meat eaters" rather than people who scrounge for vegetables for sustenance.
The Northern Territory Kukatja were often referred to in the ethnographical literature by Arerrnte exonyms for them, either "Loritja" or "Aluritja", which bore pejorative connotations. 
According to Kenny (2013), "The people living to the immediate west of the Western Aranda called themselves Kukatja or Loritja at the turn of the twentieth century. Today they call themselves Luritja or Kukatja-Luritja when referring to their ancestry and history.
Country.
According to an estimate made by Norman Tindale, the Kukatja of the Northern Territory (Luritja) had tribal lands covering some . Their territory is immediately west of the Derwent River, that formed their frontier with the Arrernte. He defined them as dwelling west of the Gosse Range and Palm Valley on the south
MacDonnell Ranges. Their southern limits went as far as Tempe Downs, and they ranged southwest to Lake Amadeus, the George Gill Range, the Merandji (the Cleland Hills) and Inindi near Mount Forbes. They were also present round Palmer, Walker, and Rudall creeks.
The Luritja divided the year into four seasons, not by months, but in terms of heat or its absence: "lurba/lurbaka" was the cold period, followed by the warming period called "mballangata". The hottestpeak, in summer, was known as "mballaka/albobuka," followed by "lurbagata."
Ethnography.
The first sustained, fundamental ethnographic work on the Kukatja was done by the Lutheran missionary Carl Strehlow, who produced six monumental volumes in German on them and the neighbouring Arerrnte, published between 1907 and 1920.
The Luritja, together with other central Australian peoples, were the object of the first attempt to undertake an examination of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theories concerning "primitive" society in Australia when Géza Róheim did fieldwork among them for eight months in 1929.

Some words.
The following are designated as Luritja words by R. H. Mathews.

Country.
According to AUSTLANG, two areas of Luritja speakers have been distinguished: southern groups, whose language is influenced by Yankunytjatjara language, living south of Hermmannsburg, and another group, referred to as Pintupi-Luritja, whose traditional land lies north-west and west of Hermannsburg, including Haasts Bluff, Papunya, Mt Liebig and Kintore.
Land rights.
The Luritja people established the Luritja Land Association in 1974, which was the first Aboriginal land rights organisation in Central Australia. In December 1993, around of land was purchased on behalf of the traditional owners, including the pastoral leases, Tempe Downs and Middleton Ponds. Over 350 Luritja people lived or intended to live on the land.

Ramkrishna Biswas (16 January 1910 – 4 August 1931) was a Bengali revolutionary and martyr. He was an active member of Surya Sen's revolutionary group.
Early life.
Biswas was born in Saroatali, Chittagong in British India. His father's name was Durga Kripa Biswas. In 1928, Biswas came first in an entrance examination among the district, later joining the revolutionary independence movement led by "Master Da" Surya Sen. In 1930, he was seriously wounded while preparing bombs.
Revolutionary activities and death.
Surya Sen and his followers decided to assassinate one Mr. Craig, the Inspector General of Police for Chittagong. Biswas and Kalipada Chakrabarty were assigned to this task. On 1 December 1930, they went to Chandpur station, but mistakenly killed a rail inspector, Tarini Mukherjee, instead of Craig. Biswas and Chakravarty were arrested on 2 December 1930. Biswas's family and friends lacked the funds required to travel to Chittagong and visit him in Alipore Jail, Kolkata. At that time, another revolutionary nationalist Pritilata Waddedar was staying in Kolkata and was asked to meet Biswas. She was successful in pretending to be his sister, in order to gain access. Biswas' martyrdom later inspired Pritilata.
Biswas was sentenced to death after his trial. In the morning of 4 August 1931, he was executed at Alipore Central Jail. His accomplice, Kalipada Chakrabarty, was transported to the Cellular Jail on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

Weijun Chen

Weijun Chen (Chinese 陈为军; born November 30, 1969) is a Chinese documentary director, cinematographer, screenwriter and producer, now working for the Wuhan TV Station. He started his career in film industry in 1994, known for his first documentary film "To Live is Better Than to Die" (2003), which won the Peabody Awards in 2003 and nominated for the World Documentary at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival, "Please Vote for Me" (2007) was selected into Oscar documentary feature shortlist, it was purchased by over 100 TV Stations, including BBC and PBS. His recent work "This is Life" (2017) receives domestic attention. His films mainly focus on documentary realism, which reflects introspection of social reality.
Experience and style.
In 1992, Weijun Chen graduated from department of journalism in Sichuan University, after watching documentary films "Long Ji" (1994) ("龙脊") and "Odyssey of The Great Wall" (1991) ("望长城"), he got impressed by the cinematography of these two films, realized that documentary film could be not that "official". While working for the Wuhan TV Station, he tried to make some documentary films, the first film he made is about a professor of philosophy, Xiaomang Deng who works at Wuhan University, and an engineer Ping Xiao works for Wuhan Meat Processing Factory, these two person seem to be irrelevant in terms of occupation, whereas Chen finds there are some common aspects in their daily life, so this becomes one of his filming style, putting irrelevant person into same story and see the magical effects.
He also suggests young filmmakers to get more experience from their daily life. "If you really want to make a good film, you should treat your friends, partners and children, all these relationships sincerely. Your feeling maybe incomplete because your life experience is not completed. If you don't support a family, you won't know the expense; If you don't get married, you won't know how hard to keep a relationship; If you don't have a baby, you won't know how difficult to raise he/her. The life experience just like a tree, shade grows with the tree branches spread out."
He stated that most things happen in real life is more exciting than script, people in real life are more touchable than actor/actress, documentary films are not synonymous with dullness, it should be seen by more people. He believes that documentary films are able to bring experience for audience instead of solving problems or making statements.
Major works.
To Live is Better Than to Die (2003) is Weijun Chen's first documentary film, he records a poor family living in the rural area of Wenluo in Henan province, where 60% of the residents are HIV positive. Like other villagers, the parents Ma Shenyi and his wife Leimei have sold their blood for money in the early nineties and got infected with HIV virus due to the poor sanitary facilities, passed the virus to their two youngest kids except for the elder daughter. Weijun Chen started his filming in 2001 summer, he pretended to be a local resident and hid his camera into a bag in order to evade the restrictions from local government. By recording the catastrophe caused by AIDS in Ma's family through heat summer, mid autumn, freezing winter and the Spring Festival, the unemotional cinematography style telling a heartbreaking story.
Chen said it is hard to portray democracy in China, the Please Vote for Me (2007) story just come to his mind, when he knew a colleague's child is going to have an election for monitor in his class. What does democracy like in children's eyes? Because "children are like mirrors that reflects the truth", so he decided to shoot a "real" democracy election in a third-grade class of Evergreen Primary School in Wuhan. It takes him 3 months to get familiar with the students, 4 weeks for filming, which also includes glimpses into Chinese education system about the routine school life like flag raising, lunch time, exercise, and parental education as well. "There are not too many people really care about the democracy, and fewer of them interested in democracy in China, however people really care for children." He comes up with a metaphor about the structure of the film, "lots of people don't like to eat the skin of buns, if you try to entice them with delicious filling, they would eat both of them."
In "This is Life", Weijun Chen focus on four pregnant women and their family to explore the problem behind Chinese medical insurance system, the clichés in rural villages, and the ethical problems as well. It takes Weijiun Chen and his team more than 700 days to track families in the department of gynecology in Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital. Giving birth to new life makes the delivery rooms combine with life and death, hopes and disappointment, and also the gap between old and young generation. The Chinese title of this film is "Sheng Men" (生门), according to the director, which means those mothers who crossed from the gate of life and death. "It really piercing my heart when I saw a woman dead for childbirth."

Tucson Inn

The Tucson Inn is a motel located in Tucson, Arizona, in an area now known as the Miracle Mile Historic District. The motel was built in 1953 in the Googie architecture and Modernist style, and is an example of historic 1950s Mid-century modern highway motel architecture.
Intended to attract tourists and overnight motorists crossing the country on U.S. Route 80 and U.S. Route 89, the building was one of Tucson's largest motor hotels when it was constructed. The luxury inn was designed by Anne Jackson Rysdale, the only registered female architect in Arizona at the time. The architecture typifies classic, clean modernism paired with the boisterous exuberance of midcentury industrial design as exemplified by the monumental neon sign. Amenities enhanced the attractiveness of its sixty-five guest rooms, included a heated swimming pool, formal restaurant, and a diner/coffee shop. The construction of Interstate 10 and the subsequent additional off-ramp exits reduced the relevance and robust economic power of Miracle Mile. Nevertheless, the Tucson Inn and its iconic neon sign survived the corridor's decline.
History.
Architect Anne Jackson Rysdale conceived the Tucson Inn as a two-story, U-shaped motor hotel typical of national motel design trends developing across the country following World War II. American prosperity led to increased mobility and national optimism during the 1950s. Artists and industrial creators expressed this new confidence in the design of American cars and architecture. Americans were on the road, traveling paved highways to romantic parts of the country; the proliferation of motels was a natural extension of this highway experience. Before the appearance of now ubiquitous "motel chains," The Tucson Inn was developed as part of a growing movement of improved amenities competing for motor tourist.
The opening of the Tucson Inn was a city milestone. Multiple newspaper articles detailed the property and its opening. According to Micheline Keating of the Tucson Daily Citizen, three months before the property opened on November 8, 1952:
The latest of these luxury motor hotels, Tucson Inn, is expected to be ready for business by the end of November. A 65- unit job, owners Lyndon Miner and Phil Baker say the inn will be a "real showplace when finished." Combining a color combination of brown, white, green, and pink, Tucson Inn will be the only two story motel in Tucson. The U-shape building will feature a covered balcony around the second floor. It will be operated with a 24-hour lobby service and complete hotel facilities. As Newhall puts it: "Our aim is to make Tucson motor hotels the best in the county and help Tucson’s reputation grow as an outstanding spot to stop, to stay, to live." (Keating)
In the days leading to the opening of the Tucson Inn, numerous articles detailed the various amenities available to guests in the January 30, 1953 Tucson Daily Citizen:
Bathing beauties, telecasting, and tours of the premises are among the fanfare and trumpeting heralding Sunday’s formal opening of the new Tucson Inn.
The half-million dollar motor hotel, located on Drachman street just west of Stone Avenue has been receiving guests for the past month. The 63-unit hotel is owned by Lyndon Miner, formerly of Phoenix and Phil Baker of Salt Lake City. The U-shaped structure is two-storied with continuous covered verandas on both floors. There is a large sundeck overlooking Mabel Street. The rooms are so arranged that large families may be conveniently accommodated.
The rooms are furnished with single, twin or double beds and each has a dressing alcove and closet. Some have full bath and shower equipment, and others contain a stall shower only. There is a 24-hour switchboard service to all rooms. And each room is equipped with a radio selector for all Tucson stations as well as one for the reception of record music controlled in the central office. A dining room and coffee shop located in a separate building fronting Drachman Street was opened last Sunday. The coffee shop has 24-hour service. Picture windows in the dining rooms overlook the heated swimming pool and a flagstone lounging terrace. Later on, tables for dining service will be added to the terrace area. The dining rooms are open to the general public as well as hotel guests. The new inn employs a staff of 30 and is managed by Mike Muchmore, who has had four years experience in motor hotel management in Phoenix.
By 1954 the owners began planning for the expansion of the property with the Tucson Inn Annex. By 1956, the 65-unit motor hotel substantially expanded with a second outer "U", encircling the original, increasing the number of rooms to 205. The Manger Hotel Corporation purchased the Inn in 1960 for two million dollars. By 1960, the motel contained four dining rooms, two kitchens, a coffee shop and cocktail lounge, but within a few decades, however, the corridor was in severe economic decline. The large expansion was demolished, leaving only the original buildings.
The motel was home to the Bagdad Room, a bar and restaurant that featured celebrity performers of the mid-century era. The motel's guests included Western film stars shooting movies at Old Tucson Studios, and thought leaders including author Ernest Hemingway and painter Waldo Peirce.
Preservation.
The motel is a contributing property within the Miracle Mile Historic District. and saved from demolition in 2018, when it was purchased by Pima Community College who made public commitments at the time of purchase their plan preserve and restore the building.

Jairus Lyles (born July 6, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for Krka of the Slovenian League and ABA League Second Division. He played college basketball for the UMBC Retrievers. He also competed for the VCU Rams in his freshman season but played a limited role before transferring. Prior to college, Lyles attended DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Maryland, where he was a three-star recruit. At UMBC, he earned all-conference honors for three consecutive years. He most notably led the Retrievers to a first-round victory over Virginia at the 2018 NCAA Tournament, the first time a 16-seed defeated a 1-seed in men's tournament history.
Early life.
Lyles was born in Silver Spring, Maryland to Lester Lyles and Carol Motley. His father Lester was a four-year football player for the Virginia Cavaliers, for whom he won the 1984 Peach Bowl, before spending seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL). His mother Carol attended the University of Virginia as well. In addition, Lyles' sister Symone played four seasons of basketball for the Ohio Bobcats. His parents later divorced, and Jairus was mainly raised by his mother.

Lyles also played for Team Takeover on the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) circuit, competing alongside Josh Hart. Lyles was rated a consensus three-star recruit and chose to play for VCU in college despite drawing interest from Oklahoma State, who gave him an offer, as well as Penn State and Virginia Tech.
College career.
Lyles competed for the VCU Rams as a freshman in 2013–14 under head coach Shaka Smart, averaging 0.7 points, 0.2 rebounds, and 0.3 assists in only 2.9 minutes per game. He only recorded two field goals in the season, scoring a season-high three points on two occasions, against Fordham and Rhode Island. Following the season, he transferred to play for the Robert Morris Colonials but was forced to sit out in 2014–15 due to eligibility rules. After one semester at Robert Morris, Lyles transferred to the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), where he would play for the Retrievers starting in the 2015–16 season. He made an instant impact as a sophomore for UMBC, averaging 23.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 2.8 assists per game and garnering second-team All-America East Conference accolades. In his junior season, Lyles averaged 18.9 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 2.6 assists en route to second-team All-America East honors.

On March 10, in the championship game of the 2018 America East Tournament vs. Vermont, Lyles scored 27 points, including a game-winning three-pointer with 0.5 seconds left in regulation. He was named most outstanding player (MOP) of the tournament. On March 16, at the first round of the 2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, Lyles notched a game-high 28 points, shooting 9-of-11 from the field, to lead UMBC to a 20-point upset over top-seeded Virginia.

Night Fare

Night Fare is a 2015 French action-thriller film directed by Julien Seri. Jonathan Howard and Jonathan Demurger star as friends who antagonize a Paris taxi driver (Jess Liaudin) by not paying the fare. The taxi driver chases them through the city, killing several people who get in his way.
Plot.
Englishman Chris returns to Paris after abruptly leaving two years ago. He meets his ex-girlfriend, Ludivine, and friend, Luc, frustrated to learn they are now dating. Luc takes them to a party, where Chris talks to Ludivine. She reminds him that he left without any explanation and says she is over him. Ludivine takes Luc's car when she leaves early. Upset, Chris also leaves the party, and Luc follows him, attempting to persuade him to attend another party. As they drunkenly walk through Paris, Luc suggests they steal a car. Chris refuses and suggests getting a taxi instead. Luc snorts cocaine in the cab, further upsetting Chris. The driver does not react and remains silent during the entire trip, unnerving them. Luc says he needs to get money from an ATM but runs off, laughing. Chris apologetically flees the cab, joining Luc.
Luc reveals he has a large amount of cash on him and refused to pay on a whim. As Chris and Luc argue, the taxi driver stalks them, chasing them down several streets. Eventually, Luc is confronted by several hostile police officers. Though Luc protests they have done nothing wrong, their leader searches them and steals Luc's cash. One policeman declines to accept the money, and the rest split it. After the police leave, Luc and Chris blame each other for the current situation and something that happened two years ago, only for the taxi driver to chase them again. They lead him to an underground car park, where a security guard confronts him. The guard beats his dog when it refuses to attack the driver. Enraged by the man's actions, the driver beats him and rescues the dog.
The driver once again finds them and chases them through Paris. Frustrated and unwilling to go to the police, Luc takes them to Detox, a violent gangster. There, Luc claims that the taxi driver stole his money, which he owes to Detox. When Detox sees the driver outside his house, he leaves with a sword. The driver easily kills him, enters the house, and kills everyone but Chris and Luc, who flee. Finally convinced their danger, Luc calls the police. Chris looks for a street sign to tell them their location, but the driver hits him with the car. Now slowed down, they flee again, only to be stopped by the same policeman who earlier robbed Luc. The police arrest Chris and Luc for the massacre, ignoring their warnings that the driver is nearby. The driver attacks the policemen but spares the life of the one who refused to take Luc's money.
Luc and Chris rescue a wounded officer and flee into a nearby park in his car. After the officer dies, they panic, knowing that they have no witnesses left to implicate the driver. They fight each other to a draw, eventually revealing what happened two years ago: Chris and Luc drunkenly harassed a homeless person, pouring alcohol on him as they mimed urinating. When he fought back, they beat him, accidentally causing him to catch on fire and die. They discuss the possibility that the driver knows about this somehow and is punishing them. Luc receives a call from Ludivine, who says the driver has kidnapped her and brought her to a factory. Luc suggests they abandon her, but Chris refuses. Chris rescues Ludivine but is overpowered by the driver. Luc appears and helps him, but the driver easily overpowers both of them.
Chris begs the driver to leave Ludivine alone. The driver releases her but silently demands that Luc accompany him. Luc, sure that he is to be killed, enters the taxi. He is surprised to be put in a jail cell naked. After an undisclosed amount of time, the driver gives him a book to read that details the history of a secret society of vigilantes that recruits from people who have repented from selfish and violent lives. Overcome by the realization that he, too, has lived a selfish life, Luc agrees to join the driver's secret society. After training with him, the driver drops off Luc in front of violent mugging, leaving him to stop it himself.
Production.
The €560,000 budget was raised through a combination of private investors and crowdfunding.
Release.
After a festival run, "Night Fare" opened in France on 16 January 2016.
Reception.
On French review aggregator website AlloCiné, "Night Fare" has an average rating of 2.4/5 stars based on nine reviews. British magazine "Starburst" rated it 8/10 stars. Their reviewer, Joel Harley, praised the film's twist ending but said it will likely divide audiences. Writing for American horror website Bloody Disgusting, Patrick Cooper called the premise "ripe for excitement" but said the film degenerates into moralizing and has an unbelievable ending. Gareth Jones of Dread Central rated it 5/5 stars and called it one of the best films of the year.
"Night Fare" won Best Feature Film at the Mile High Horror Film Festival.

Joseph Ngalula

Joseph Ngalula Mpandajila (born 12 December 1928) is a Congolese writer and politician. 
Biography.
Joseph Ngalula was born on 12 December 1928 in Lusambo, Belgian Congo to a Baluba family. He undertook six years of primary education and five years of professional courses. He was fluent in English and French. In June 1960 Barthélemy Mukenge was elected President of Kasai Province by the provincial assembly. Unhappy with the results, on 14 June the assembly opposition declared their own provincial government under Ngalula. On 16 June 1960 Ngalula was appointed Kasai Minister of Economic Affairs by Mukenge without consultation. On 9 August Albert Kalonji declared that the south-eastern region of the province was seceding to form the Autonomous State of South Kasai and appointed Ngalula its Prime Minister. In July 1961 the relationship between the two deteriorated, and Ngalula was driven into exile. Since he had been the person chiefly responsible for the organisation of the state, South Kasai's administration broke down following his departure. He subsequently established his own political party, the Democratic Union, to oppose the Kalonjists. In August 1961 he was appointed Minister of Education under Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula. He held the post until April 1963.
Ngalula was one of the Members of Parliament who signed an open letter to Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko in 1980. Later, he co-founded the opposition party UDPS, together with Étienne Tshisekedi, Marcel Lihau, and others. Because of his engagement in the political opposition to Mobutu, he was imprisoned, banished, and pardoned several times.
Ngalula was elected to the Senate in 2007.

Ivana Habazin

Ivana Habazin (born 22 October 1989) is a Croatian professional boxer. She is a former two-weight world champion, having held the IBF female welterweight title in 2014 and the IBO female middleweight title in 2018.
Early life.
Habazin was born on 22 October 1989 in Zlatar, Croatia. A Catholic, Habazin wanted to enter a monastery at the age of 14, but later decided to pursue a career in boxing, which she began training at the age of 19. She was inspired to begin boxing by the movie "Rocky".
She holds a master's degree in theology and attends the Dag Hammarskjöld college for a specialist degree in International Relations and Diplomacy.
Professional career.
Habazin made her professional debut in June 2010, against Edit Szigeti, whom she defeated by a first round TKO. Habazin kept her undefeated record over her next nine fights, achieving stoppage victories against Emeke Halas, Ava Kovacs and twice against Daniela Bickei, as well as decision victories against Edita Karabeg twice, Marija Vuković and twice against Suzana Radovanović.
Her 10 fight winning streak earned her the chance to fight Eva Bajic for the vacant IBF female welterweight title. Bajic won the fight by unanimous decision.
Habazin rebounded from this loss with two decision victories, defeating Teodora Georgieva and Borislava Goranova. She once against challenged for the IBF female welterweight title against Sabrina Giuliani in March 2014. Habazin won the fight by split decision. She afterwards scheduled to defend her IBF title against Cecilia Brækhus, who was the defending WBO, WBA and WBC champion. Brækhus won the fight by unanimous decision.
She once again rebounded from this loss with two victories, a decision against Galina Gyumliyska and a first round stoppage of Dajana Bukva. These two victories gave Habazin the chance to fight Mikaela Laurén for the WBC female light middleweight title. Laurén won the fight by a third round TKO.
Following this loss, Habazin would win her next two fights, winning unanimous decisions against Valentina Stanković and Sanja Ristić. She was scheduled to fight Elene Sikmashvili for the vacant IBO female middleweight title. Habazin defeated Sikmashvili by a fifth round TKO. Habazin was scheduled to defend her IBO title six months later against Gifty Amanua Ankrah. Habazin won the fight by unanimous decision. Three months later, Habazin fought a rematch with Eva Bajic, winning the fight by unanimous decision.
Habazin was scheduled to defend her title for the second time against Claressa Shields in January 2020. This was the third time this fight was scheduled, with Shields pulling out the first time due to a knee injury, while the fight was cancelled the second time as Shields' brother Timothy Johnson assaulted Habazin's coach James Ali Bashir. Shields won the fight by unanimous decision.
She was scheduled to fight Layla McCarter in March 2021. Habazin was later rescheduled to fight Nana Chakhvashvili for the World Boxing Council Middle East Welterweight title. She won the fight by a second round TKO.

Hazel Vaughn Leigh

Hazel Vaughn Leigh (July 27, 1897 – April 27, 1995) was a philanthropist and civic leader in Fort Worth, Texas. As founder and longtime director of the Fort Worth Boys Club, she devoted her life to improving the lives of boys in Fort Worth and Tarrant County. She was the first, and for many years, only female director of a boys' club in the United States. Leigh was inducted into the Texas Women's Hall of Fame in 1993.
Early life.
Hazel Elizabeth Vaughn was born July 27, 1897, in Fort Worth to Bessie Elizabeth DeCory and Sam Vaughn. Both parents' families were early Texas settlers. Her maternal great-grandfather had arrived in Tarrant County in 1845, and subsequent generations were raised on family land on Oak Grove Road, in present-day southeast Fort Worth. Hazel's mother was a graduate of Fort Worth's Polytechnic College; her father worked for Axtell Windmill Supply and was known for his sense of humor. Hazel and her older brother, Howard, grew up in a house at the corner of Lipscomb and Rosedale Streets in the area now known as the Near Southside; the family later moved to a home on Travis Avenue. She attended the DeZavala School, Alexander Hogg School, took piano lessons at Fort Worth University, and graduated from Fort Worth Central High School in 1915. She did not immediately attend college due to ill health.
Career.
Hazel was active in Fort Worth society. She was an active member of the Ich Ka Bibble Club, Yaki Ki Yi Club and Falcolm Hegbeth Social Club until the latter was dissolved after a fatal drunk driving accident resulting from spiked punch at a club party; the club was re-formed as the Junior League of Fort Worth. She attended dances and other social events at Camp Bowie during World War I, and worked at the camp filing personnel records after its closure in 1918. In 1920, Hazel voted in the first election open to women. The same year, she was hired to handle truancy at Daggett Elementary School; in 1923 she became assistant to the school's principal.
San Francisco.
In 1925, Grover accepted a position at Marland Oil Company and the couple moved to San Francisco. Hazel took a job writing classified ads at the San Francisco Chronicle under an assumed name so that her husband—and his employer—would not find out about her work. Within six months she was promoted to manager of classified advertising and supervised a staff of 34. When Grover eventually found out how she was spending her days and Hazel's newspaper career came to an abrupt halt, she joined the Daughters of the Confederacy and took an interest in the Columbia Park Boys' Club in the Mission District.
Return to Fort Worth.
The Leighs returned to Fort Worth in 1926 when Marland Oil opened a Fort Worth office. Hazel worked at the Fort Worth Press and was again active in Fort Worth society, becoming a member of the Fort Worth Woman's Club. Grover left the oil business for law enforcement, joining the Secret Service and eventually becoming deputy sheriff of Tarrant County and a deputy U.S. Marshal. In 1931, Hazel joined St. Andrews Episcopal Church, although raised a Baptist, and took a public speaking course at Texas Christian University.
Panther Boys' Club.
Funded by members of the local Rotary Club, the Panther Boys' Club opened on 3rd Street in downtown Fort Worth in 1926, becoming the second-oldest boys' club in Texas. In 1927 Fort Worth society women formed the Panther Boys' Club Women's Council to support the club. Hazel's mother became president of the women's auxiliary in 1930, and Hazel accepted the role of vice-president in 1933. Only a month later, Hazel assumed the presidency, and by 1934 had tripled membership in the group.
In 1934, the Panther Boys' Club hired a new executive director, causing a rift between the boys' club administration and the women's auxiliary. A group from the women's auxiliary, led by Hazel Vaughn Leigh, broke away from the Panther Boys' Club and formed the Fort Worth Boys Club in 1935.
Fort Worth Boys Club.
The new Fort Worth Boys Club was established in Fort Worth's Northside with funding from the Kiwanis Club of North Fort Worth. Northside was chosen because it was the most populous part of the city with the "greatest delinquency" among children and teens. The new club opened at Boulevard Methodist Church on February 1, 1935, available to boys ages 6–14. 205 boys enrolled on opening day; enrollment had more than tripled by October of the same year. The club opened a new building at 100 Northwest 28th Street in 1937.
The club offered free medical care, eyeglasses, and clothing; after-school snacks were provided when boys began fainting from hunger. In addition to such necessities, boys attended free movies at the New Isis Theatre, received music lessons, and were given lectures on first aid, good citizenship, and the Bible. Boys were taken on hikes by students from Texas Christian University and led in other activities by Works Progress Administration and National Youth Administration workers between the ages of 16 and 25. Under Hazel's leadership, the women operating Fort Worth Boys Club held parties and bridge tournaments as fundraisers and worked tirelessly to secure financial backing for the club throughout the remainder of the Great Depression. The club's needs increased rapidly during World War II as many more families had working parents due to war industries and tours of duty. Special training was also provided for older boys preparing to enter the armed services.
In 1957, Hazel was awarded the Boys Club of America's Bronze Keystone Award for her work with the Fort Worth Boys Club. In 1959, she was appointed by governor Price Daniel to represent Texas at the White House Conference on Children and Youth and to serve a ten-year term on the State Committee for the Study of Juvenile Delinquency. In 1960, she was awarded the Boys' Club Professional Association's Golden Boy Award at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York. She led the expansion of the Fort Worth Boys Club to include a recreation center at Eagle Mountain Lake in the 1970s and retired as the club's director in 1973, having grown membership to over 3500 boys. She continued to serve on the organization's board until 1985 when the core group of women leading the club lost an internal power struggle. The new leadership of the Fort Worth Boys Club honored Hazel with a Lifetime of Philanthropy award in 1987; in 1990, the club merged with the Panther Boys' Club to become the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Greater Fort Worth. Among its notable alumni are professional football player and Texas House representative Yale Lary, pastor John Osteen, and Olympic shot putter Darrow Hooper.
Other associations and honors.
Hazel was a charter member of the American Legion Auxiliary. She and her mother were both active in the Democratic Party. She was invited to attend a dinner honoring John F. Kennedy in Austin on November 22, 1963, but he was assassinated in Dallas earlier that day. She also attended the inauguration of Texas governor Dolph Briscoe in 1975.
Hazel was one of the first 150 boys' club directors to be certified as Professional Workers of Boys Clubs, and a charter member of the National Association of Social Workers. She represented the American Association of University Women on the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women in 1960. In 1979, she was the recipient of the American Association of University Women's Hercules Award and the Boys' Clubs Professional Association Gold Award. Hazel was a member of the Texas Social Welfare Association, Girls Protective Association, and Tarrant County Historical Society.
Hazel was the president of the '93 Club, active in The Woman's Club of Fort Worth, the honorary vice president of the TCU Frog Club, an honorary Tarrant County deputy sheriff, and an honorary member of the Theta Epsilon sorority. She served on the Fort Worth Public Library board of trustees and citizen advisory board from 1973 to 1979 and was the recipient of the North Fort Worth Historical Society's Tad Lucas Life Achievement Award in 1993. In 1993, Hazel was also nominated to the Texas Women's Hall of Fame.
Personal life.
In 1923, Hazel Vaughn married Grover Cleveland Leigh (1888–1943), whom she had met through her brother. Grover, an Illinois native, had moved to Fort Worth as an employee of Empire Gas and Fuel. He was then relocated to Bartlesville, Oklahoma, where the couple was wed and lived for two years. These were the first years that Hazel, raised in a wealthy family, had lived without servants. In the 1930s, Hazel and Grover's relationship became strained as he developed a problem with alcohol. The couple, who suffered a deeply unhappy marriage, lived with Hazel's parents for several years even though Grover had a successful career. They never had any children and Grover died from head injuries caused by an accident at the Texas &amp; Pacific Railway yards in 1943; he is buried at Shannon Rose Hill Cemetery in east Fort Worth. In the 1980s, a "billionaire friend" from Hazel's Bartlesfield, Oklahoma days proposed marriage, but she declined.
Hazel Vaughn Leigh died on April 27, 1995. She is buried at Fort Worth's Greenwood Cemetery.

Shmerke Kaczerginski

Shmaryahu "Shmerke" Kaczerginski (Yiddish: ; 28 October 1908 – 23 April 1954) was a Yiddish-speaking poet, musician, writer and cultural activist. Born to a poor family in Vilna and orphaned at a young age, Kaczerginski was educated at the local Talmud Torah and night school, where he became involved in communist politics and was regularly beaten or imprisoned.
At the age of 15 he began publishing original songs and poetry, including "Tates, mames, kinderlekh" ("Fathers, mothers, children"), and soon began organising , a secular Jewish writing collective whose other members included Abraham Sutzkever and Chaim Grade. The Nazi invasion of Poland led to Kaczerginski's eventual imprisonment in the Vilna Ghetto, where he helped hide Jewish cultural works with Sutzkever as part of the Paper Brigade and joined the United Partisans Organisation, participating in the failed Vilna Ghetto uprising and then escaping to the forest to fight with both the partisans and the Soviets.
After the recapture of Vilna, Kaczerginski returned home to recover the hidden cultural works and founded the first post-Holocaust Jewish museum in Europe; he quickly became disenchanted with the Soviets and communism and developed into an ardent Zionist. After some time in Łódź, he moved to Paris before eventually relocating to Buenos Aires, where he was killed in a plane crash at the age of 45.
Renowned during his lifetime as a poet and writer, Kaczerginski dedicated much of his time after the start of the Second World War to collecting pre-war Yiddish songs and songs of the Holocaust in order to save "Yiddishkeit" from destruction. The author, editor or publisher of most of the first post-Holocaust songbooks, Kaczerginski was responsible for preserving over 250 Holocaust songs – the majority of those still known. Despite the enduring popularity of many of his own works, and the importance of his labours to researchers and Yiddish cultural activists, his early death has led to his relative anonymity.
Early life and career.
Kaczerginski was born on 28 October 1908 in Vilna, Russian Empire, to Volf and Alte Kaczerginski. Both of his parents died in early 1914, leaving Kaczerginski and his younger brother Yankl in the care of their grandfather. He was sent to the Talmud Torah for his education, where he was "a good scholar and even better comrade". After graduating he enrolled in night school and supported himself by working for a lithographer named Hirsh Ayzenshtat, whose shop apparently served a mostly proletarian clientele. Around this time Kaczerginski was drawn into local circles of the outlawed communist party, and published his first writings – articles concerning class struggle and the living conditions of workers.
As a consequence of his political radicalism, Kaczerginski was regularly beaten by police and often imprisoned in Lukiškės Prison, where he organised a drama club for other inmates. This radicalism also led him to write his earliest known songs, including "Tates, mames, kinderlekh" ('Fathers, mothers, children'), a renowned Jewish socialist song written when he was 15 years old.
A year later he joined , a Jewish writing collective whose other members included Abraham Sutzkever and Chaim Grade. Kaczerginski was responsible for organisational work and editing, along with writing "animated, sometimes incendiary verses" that were extremely popular with the group's audience. In parallel, he worked for the Yiddish-language newspaper "Morgen Freiheit" and the Soviet organisation Agroid.

After the Soviet invasion of Poland, Kaczerginski moved to Białystok in order to volunteer for the Red Army, returning to Vilna in June 1940. Working with various Jewish writers organisations, his initial enthusiasm for the Soviet cause was soured by the shutting or censoring of many newspapers and publishing organisations, along with the arrest of Zalman Reisen and other members of the Yiddish community. Following Operation Barbarossa Vilna was occupied by Nazi Germany and the local Jewish community shot or rounded up and sent to camps or ghettos. Kaczerginski managed to avoid capture until 1942 by posing as a deaf and mute beggar.
Finally identified as Jewish, Kaczerginski was sent to the Vilna Ghetto, where he married Barbara Kaufman and returned to writing in order to improve morale for the inmates. Works produced during this time included "Friling" ('Springtime'), about his wife's death in April 1943, "Shtiler, shtiler" ('Quiet, Quiet') and "Yugnt himn" ('Hymn of Youth'). When representatives of the "Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg" (ERR)—the Nazi organisation tasked with stealing or destroying Jewish cultural property—dictated that the Jewish literary archives in Vilna be categorised and burnt, Kaczerginski was one of the Ghetto residents forced to help them. Along with other labourers working on the project, including Zelig Kalmanovich and Abraham Sutzkever, he formed the Paper Brigade, which instead smuggled thousands of works past the Nazi guards and hid them in various caches in and around the Ghetto for retrieval after the war.
Having joined the Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye ('United Partisans Organisation'), Kaczerginski fought in the failed Vilna Ghetto uprising and escaped with the survivors to the surrounding forests. Working along Sutzkever as the historian of the FPO's Vitnberg Brigade, he translated many Soviet fighting songs into Yiddish and during his service with a Soviet unit wrote the "uncharacteristically grisly-worded" "Partizaner-Marsh" ('Partisan's March'), "Yid, du Partizaner" ('The Jewish Partisan') and (Warsaw) to commemorate the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.
Vilna, Łódź and Paris.
Participating in the recapture of Vilna, Kaczerginski returned with Sutzkever, Abba Kovner and other FPO survivors to go about rebuilding Jewish culture and digging up the hidden Paper Brigade caches. He founded the Vilna Museum of Jewish Art and Culture, later known as the Vilna Jewish Museum, the first post-Holocaust Jewish museum in Europe, with some of the recovered materials. Although the museum was theoretically supported by Lithuanian and Soviet authorities, they provided few resources, assigning the organisers no budget and only giving them a burnt out former Ghetto building as a headquarters. Following the end of the war in 1945, it became clear that the volunteers' work was incompatible with the priorities of Soviet authorities, who burnt 30 tons of cache materials and, having demanded that any publicly displayed books be reviewed by a censor, simply refused to return any that were submitted.
Accordingly, Kaczerginski and others prepared to smuggle the collection yet again—this time to the United States. Volunteers took the books across the border to Poland, enlisting the help of Bricha contacts to move them into non-Soviet Europe. From there much of the material went to New York, although some was retained by Sutzkever (who later gave his material to the National Library of Israel).
After departing Vilna (and experiencing extreme anti-semitism in Moscow), Kaczerginski moved to the largely-intact city of Łódź, where he was employed by the Central Jewish Historical Commission. Kaczerginski had begun working as a ('collector') of Jewish music in 1944, considering the partisan and ghetto songs to be "the martyrs’ last will and testament to future generations" and worthy of preservation. Lacking formal musical training, Kaczerginski instead memorised each song, interviewing former comrades and other survivors, before having them transcribed by David Botwinik.
Using some of this material, he edited and published "Undzer gezang", the first post-war Jewish songbook in Poland and the first songbook to explicitly include "ghetto songs". Having undergone a political transformation during the war and early Soviet occupation, he shifted from communism to an engagement with Zionism, writing "Khalutsim lid" ('Pioneers' song') in 1946 and collaborating with the Zionist Gordoniya collective to help Jewish children in Łódź. A year later he married Meri Szutan, a native of Švenčionys.
In the aftermath of the 1946 Kielce pogrom, vast numbers of Polish Jews left the country, including Kaczerginski, who settled in Paris. From there he toured 17 displaced persons camps in November 1947, lecturing survivors of the Holocaust, gathering new songs, and stopping in Munich to record several pieces for the Jewish Historical Commission. During this time he also wrote several original works, including ('Our Song') in tribute to Hirsh Glick, and "S'vet geshen" ('It Will Happen') commemorating the British attack on the "SS Exodus". His employment with the Parisian Jewish Culture Congress allowed him to visit the United States in 1948 to attend the World Jewish Cultural Conference, and he used the opportunity to take speaking engagements in 30 different cities before returning to Paris.
The remainder of the 1940s saw a writing rate that was "productive even by his own industrious standards". 1947 saw the publication of a ghetto songbook ("Dos gezang fun vilner geto"), a social history of the destruction of Vilna ("Khurbn vilna") and "Partizaner geyen!", or 'Partisans Advance!', a memoir of his time in combat with the FPO. A year later he published another songbook, "Lider fun di getos un" and in 1949 the political tract "Tsvishn hamer un serp": 'Between Hammer and Sickle'. The late 1940s also saw the birth of his only daughter and child, Libele.
Move to Argentina and death.
Having visited Israel in 1950, Kaczerginski was excited by the possibility of moving there – but instead chose to take his family to Buenos Aires, after a job offer from the Jewish Cultural Congress, and they sailed there in May 1950. Already famous as a result of both his lecturing and publication, Kaczerginski's arrival:
Local leftists vehemently opposed Kaczerginski due to his explicit conversion away from communism, and often disrupted his speaking engagements. Despite this he maintained a heavy pace of lecturing, songwriting and journalism, writing for the Israeli Labor Party newspaper "Hador" and publishing ('I Was a Partisan: The Green Legend'), a two-part memoir based on the journals he had maintained throughout the Second World War. Working with Michl Gelbart and Artur Rolnik, he began work on another anthology of Yiddish songs, and in parallel wrote "Zol shoyn kumen di geule" ('Let Salvation Come'). Set to music by Abraham Isaac Kook, the song is considered "one of its author’s most enduring works".
In 1954 during the festival of Passover, Kaczerginski found himself lecturing in Mendoza; after local anti-communists swore to boycott his lecture, he extended his time there for an extra day, speaking to hundreds about his experience as a Ghetto fighter. Wanting to see his family again, he decided to travel by plane rather than the longer train route, and was on the flight to Buenos Aires from Mendoza on 23 April 1954, when it crashed shortly after takeoff, killing everyone on board (see also Aerolíneas Argentinas accidents and incidents).
Legacy.
Kaczerginski's sudden death shocked the Yiddish-speaking world; to Chaim Grade, his loss marked "the inescapable end of the Old World Yiddish cultural community, already decimated and dispersed". Sutzkever, having heard of the accident in Tel Aviv, simply telegrammed the Kaczerginski family : "we will not believe, there are no words". Many years later Sutzkever wrote him a memorial poem, "Mit shmerken, ven es brenen velder" ('With Shmerke, when forests are burning').
Kaczerginski himself has become "largely anonymous", and is little known outside of Yiddish language circles despite the enduring popularity of many of his songs. Despite this, he is considered to have been tremendously influential: having collected over 250 Holocaust songs during his time as a partisan, poet and writer, his songbooks are the source of the majority of surviving pieces of the genre.

Louise Aslanian

Louise Aslanian (pseudonym "LAS"; , ; 5 May 1904 – 30 January 1945) was a French-Armenian communist and anti-fascist activist, writer, novelist, poet and a prominent figure in the French Resistance.
Biography.
Early life.
Louise Srapionovna Aslanian (Grigorian) was born on 5 May 1904 in Tabriz (Iran) to Armenian parents Srapion Grigorian and Maria (née Shahbazian). Louise graduated from a primary school in Tabriz and then continued her studies at a Tiflis Russian gymnasium. She demonstrated her literary gift in school by writing lyrical poems, making literature translations from Russian and French. Aslanian started playing piano from an early age. Upon her return to Tabriz, in 1923 she married the lawyer Arpiar Aslanian.
Life in France.
In 1923, the couple moved to Paris, taking with them Mania and Arshaluys (Louise's mother and sister, respectively). In Paris, Aslanian wanted to continue her musical education playing piano, but due to lack of money she had to give up her dream. Instead, she went to the faculty of literature at the Sorbonne. In Paris she took an active part in the work of the Armenian-French writers' society, worked in newspapers, acquired acquaintances in literary circles and took the pseudonym "LAS".
In the mid-twenties she published several short stories in the French-Armenian press: "a Coin Collection", "an Iron Wine Seller", "the Swamp", etc. In 1928 she published the collection of short stories "Khan".
In 1935 her collection of stories "Gtsits durs" ("Beyond the line") was published in two volumes.
In 1936, Aslanian joined the French Communist Party and began to collaborate with the Armenian newspaper "Manouchian" . She also worked in the newspaper "New life". In the same year she published her novel "Kaskatsneri Ughiner" ("The Way of doubt»), in two volumes (also published after Aslanian's death in 1959 in Yerevan).
In 1937, Las became the Chairman of the Committee of assistance to Armenia (HOC), as well as the Chairman of the Union of Armenian women of Paris. Aslanian was a member of the Union of Armenian writers France.
French Resistance.
After the Nazis occupied France, the Aslanians joined the French Resistance in 1940. According to the memoirs of Henry Karajan (member of the "Group of Manouchian"), Louise was a recruiter for (Francs-Tireurs et Partisans) in a combat cell of the French Communist Party, formed in late 1941. The Aslanians also worked in an underground publishing house and actively engaged in supplying fighters of the French Resistance with weapons. Las opened the women's division of the French Resistance and was responsible for the Armenian Resistance in the Northern France.
Aslanian had connections with Resistance activists: Missak Manouchian, Mélinée Manouchian, Arpen Tavitian, Ayk Dpirian, Shag Taturian and others. In the French Resistance, Aslanian was called "Madeleine".
During the Resistance, the Aslanians taught math and chess to the young Charles Aznavour
Arrest, concentration camp, death.
On 26 July 1944 both Aslanians were arrested in France by the Nazis. Arrest happened at the sight of their family and neighbors at their residence (8 rue d'Elix 10, Paris, France). The couple were put into the Fresnes Prison.
Louise's diaries and manuscripts were captured and destroyed, in particular, «Histoire de la Resistance» and «La Chute de Paris».
On 15 August 1944, they were taken from Toulouse to Buchenwald. Arpiar was then transferred to the camp Dora-Mittelbau, while Louise was taken to Ravensbrück, arriving there approximately on 1 September 1944. She was assigned the camp number 57440. As early as 4 September 1944, Louise was transferred to work at the factory camp HASAG in the vicinity of Leipzig, which was a satellite camp to Buchenwald. Here she was registered under the number of 4460. Las was held in this camp with Lise London. There is some archival information concerning Aslanian's presence at camp Stalag IV-E.
While in concentration camps, Aslanian wrote the poem "Gortsaranum" ("The plant") and the unfinished poem "Mala" (an abbreviation of 4 names of those dear to her: "M" — mom Mania; A — sister Arshaluys; "L" — she, Louise; A — husband, Arpiar). The poem has been preserved thanks to her friends: Nicole Ritz and Lise London.
On 27 January 1945, Louise was taken back to Ravensbrück, where she died 3 days later under unknown circumstances. On 15 February 1945, her husband, Arpiar, was killed at camp Dora-Mittelbau.
Legacy.
Manuscripts of the last years of her life, as well as diaries and correspondence, are thought to have been completely destroyed by the Nazis. Only her earlier stories and a novel have outlived the Nazis. Some fragments of her letters have been preserved. The Arabic fund of the Matenadaran has a collection of Eastern medieval miniatures with Sufi themes that belonged to Aslanian.
In her works, Las talked about the life of the Armenian diaspora communities that had lost themselves; about their disunity and backward customs, such as blindly following local cultures. She saw the restoration of national integrity as a return to distinctiveness, in a search for a unique path of development, associated with repatriation and strong links to Armenia. As a member of the French Communist Party, she promoted the achievements of the Soviet Union. Her last verses were devoted to the struggle against fascism and the impending victory over it.

Civil War era poem.
Haralson's efforts to collect supplies for the Confederate Army are commemorated in a poem.
"John Haralson, John Haralson—you are a wretched creature;
You’ve added to this bloody war a new and useful feature.
You’d have us think, while every man is bound to be a fighter,
The Ladies, bless the pretty dears, should save their pee for nitre.
John Haralson, John Haralson, where did you get the notion,
To send the barrel ‘round to gather up the lotion?
We thought the girls had work enough to making shirts and kissing,
But you have put the pretty dears to Patriotic Pissing.
John Haralson, John Haralson, pray do invent a neater,
And somewhat less immodest way of making your saltpetre.
For ‘tis an awful idea, John, gunpowdery and cranky
That when a lady lifts her skirts, she’s killing off a Yankee."

Miracle Mile Historic District

The Miracle Mile Historic District, located on North Stone Avenue, Drachman Street, Oracle Road and Miracle Mile in Tucson, Arizona, United States, was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.
History.
Located north of downtown Tucson, the Miracle Mile Historic District is a significant commercial corridor connected to the development and alignment of Tucson's northern segment of U.S. Route 80, U.S. Route 89, and Arizona State Route 84. Throughout the mid-twentieth century, this commercial strip, known as “Miracle Mile,” functioned as the northern vehicular gateway of Tucson for travelers traversing the nation. The Miracle Mile Historic District follows the alignment of the following extant arterials: Stone Avenue, Drachman Street, Oracle Road, and Miracle Mile. Also included in the district and associated with the highway site is a two block segment of Main Avenue lined with trucking transfer warehouses and roadside commercial buildings, as well as four blocks of Flores Street containing a cluster of small motels. The bulk of the contributing resources, facing or within one block of the historic highway alignment, relate to mid‑century auto culture and were constructed in 1920 through 1963 during the district's period of significance. While the district has been rendered discontiguous by development, the identified segments have sufficient significance and integrity to meet National Register criteria. Two designated highways are routed down the Miracle Mile Historic District. The Stone Avenue, Drachman Street and Oracle Road segments of the Historic District are part of Historic U.S. Route 80, while the West Miracle Mile segment is part of Arizona State Route 77.
The Miracle Mile Historic District represents four visually and historically linked groups of buildings connected by the alignment of historical U.S. Route 80/89, which is also a contributor to the district. In total, the Miracle Mile Historic District includes 102 individual properties, many with multiple buildings, structures, and objects. Within the Miracle Mile Historic District are 279 individual resources, including 215 buildings, 1 site, 34 structures, and 29 objects. Of these resources, 258 are contributors to the district, including 198 buildings, 31 structures, 28 objects, and 1 site, while 21 are non-contributors, including 17 buildings, 3 structures, and 1 object. The district includes important buildings including the 1953 Tucson Inn, and African American Beau Brummel Club.

Among the many major purchase initiatives overseen by Nicoll were Marsden Hartley’s "Kinsman Falls" (1930, oil on canvas), Marguerite Zorach’s "The Garden" (1914, oil and charcoal on canvas) and "Diana of the Sea" (1940, oil on canvas), and Louise Nevelson’s "Untitled" (circa 1976, painted wood).
2005-2018: Smith College Museum of Art.
In 2005, Nicoll returned to her alma mater where she succeeded Suzannah Fabing as Director and Chief Curator of the Smith College Museum of Art. Fabing retired after a 13-year tenure, during which the museum underwent an extensive renovation and expansion.“The Smith College Museum of Art’s elegant new facility, outstanding collection and wonderful staff make the institution a powerful educational resource for its community and have made this an irresistible opportunity for me. As a graduate of Smith, I find this opportunity doubly exciting—a chance to do the work I love for the benefit of a community that I care about deeply.” (March 25, 2005)Widely regarded as one of the most distinguished college museums in the country, the Smith College Museum of Art is best known for its 19th- and 20th-century European and American collection. Among its permanent collection includes works by Manet, Monet, Picasso, Copley, Eakins, Stella, Motherwell, O’Keeffe and many other famous painters, along with noteworthy sculpture and classical antiquities, prints, drawings and photographs.
Under Nicoll's leadership, the museum has given particular attention to American female artists. In 2017, Nicoll oversaw the exhibition, "A Dangerous Woman: Subversion and Surrealism in the Art of Honoré Sharrer,” which took a fresh look at American artist Honoré Desmond Sharrer (1920-2009). The exhibition featured about 60 works, predominantly paintings, many of which came from Sharrer's estate. The exhibition, which represented the first public survey of Sharrer's work in many years, was organized by the Columbus Museum of Art, Ohio and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and funded by the support of Smith alumnae Judith Plesser Targan '53, Art Museum Fund and the Charlotte Frank Rabb '35 Fund.
Personal life.
Nicoll serves as a member of the New England Advisory Committee of the Archives of American Art, a research center within the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. She is also a director in the Northeast Small College Art Museum Association (NESCAMA).
Nicoll currently resides with her family in Springfield, Massachusetts.

Richard M. Friedberg

Richard M. Friedberg (born October 8, 1935), is a theoretical physicist who has contributed to a wide variety of problems in mathematics and physics. These include mathematical logic, number theory, solid state physics, general relativity, particle physics, quantum optics, genome research, and the foundations of quantum physics.
Early life.
Friedberg was born in Manhattan on Oct 8, 1935, the child of cardiologist Charles K. Friedberg, and playwright Gertrude Tonkonogy.
Academic work.
Friedberg's most well-known work dates back to the mid-1950s. As an undergraduate at Harvard, he published several papers over a period of 2–3 years. The first paper introduced the priority method, a common technique in computability theory, in order to prove the existence of recursively enumerable sets with incomparable degrees of unsolvability.
In 1968, Friedberg proved independently what became known as Bell’s inequality, not knowing that J. S. Bell had proved it a few years earlier. He showed it to the physicist and historian Max Jammer, who somehow managed to insert it into his book “The Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics”, although the latter bears the publication date 1966. This caused Friedberg some embarrassment later when classmates at Harvard, knowing of the result only through Jammer’s book, supposed that Friedberg was the first discoverer.
(A letter from Friedberg to Jammer dated May 1971 begins, “It was nice of you to remember what I showed you in 1968. I finally got around to writing it up in 1969, but just then I found out about Bell’s 1964 paper (Physics 1, 195) which had anticipated my ‘discovery’ by three years. So I did not publish.”) More recently, Friedberg worked on the foundations of quantum mechanics in collaboration with the late Pierre Hohenberg.
Friedberg is also known for his love of music and poetry. He wrote poems in several letters
 to cognitive scientist and writer Douglas Hofstadter in 1989. The last letter contains two sonnets ”The Electromagnetic Spectrum” and "Fermions and Bosons". These letters also include critiques and analyses of topics in "Metamagical Themas", a collection of articles that Hofstadter wrote for Scientific American during the early 1980s.
Friedberg wrote an informal book on number theory titled "An Adventurer's Guide to Number Theory". In the book, he states, "The difference between the theory of numbers and arithmetic is like the difference between poetry and grammar."

Caroline Dessaulles-Béique

Caroline Dessaulles-Béique ( Madame F. L. Beique, 13 October 1852 – 8 August 1946) was a Canadian social activist and feminist. She was one of the founders of the Provincial Housewife's School (), which later became the home economics department of the Université de Montréal, and an advocate who pressed for the founding of juvenile courts. She was a co-founder of the first national feminist organization, the () for French-speaking Canadian women.
Early life.
Carolina-Angélina Dessaulles was born on 13 October 1852 in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada, to Catherine-Zéphirine (née Thompson) and Louis-Antoine Dessaulles. Her father was a prominent politician, lawyer, and writer in Quebec and had served as mayor of Saint-Hyacinthe. Her uncle Georges-Casimir Dessaulles was also a mayor of Saint-Hyacinthe and went on to serve in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec and the Senate of Canada; his daughter Henriette Dessaulles, Caroline's cousin, became a noted writer. Her mother was a distant cousin to her father, through her mother, Flavia Truteau, who was connected to the distinguished Papineau family, like her father's ancestry. Dessaulles and her family moved to Montreal in 1860, where she attended the Ladies of the Sacred Heart school. On 15 April 1875 at Saint-Jacques Cathedral in Montreal, she married Frédéric-Liguori Béique, a lawyer who became president of the bar association and a senator. The couple raised their six children in Montreal.
Career.
Dessaulles-Béique began working as a social activist in 1893, when she became involved in founding the Montreal Local Council of Women (MLCW), a subsidiary organization of the National Council of Women of Canada (NCWC). In 1899, Frédéric became president of the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste and four years later, Dessaulles-Béique established the first women's organization that catered to preserving the culture of the French-speaking women of Canada. "Des dames patronesses de l'Association Saint-Jean-Baptiste" (the ladies' patronage committee of the association of Saint-Jean-Baptiste) provided women a way to become involved in the promotion of French-Canadian interests, including preservation of the French language and Catholicism. The committee, with Dessaulles-Béique as its president, was responsible for the founding of the Provincial Housewife's School () in 1906. The school served as a normal school, but also included courses to teach students how to cook, sew, manage a household, and offered classes on hygiene.
Joining forces with Marie Gérin-Lajoie
In 1907, Dessaulles-Béique and Marie Gérin-Lajoie expanded the Patronage Committee to the national level, founding the (FNSJB), for which Dessaulles-Béique served as president until 1913. The FNSJB served as an umbrella organization, uniting twenty-two women's social activist organizations. Their interests included access to education for women, aid to the poor and unemployed, Civil Code reforms, temperance, worker housing and other issues. Some of the projects that Dessaulles-Béique and the FNSJB were involved in were pressing for creation of the juvenile court system, working with the Sainte-Justine Hospital, and the distribution of milk and maternal assistance programs like Drops of Milk. From 1909 to 1910, Dessaulles-Béique simultaneously served on the executive board of the Montreal Local Council of Women.
In 1913, she resigned as president of FNSJB to turn her attention to war work, becoming involved in both the Canadian Red Cross and the Khaki League, an assistance organization for returning veterans. When World War I ended, she returned to women's programs, and was among the founders of the Provincial Committee for Women's Suffrage (, CPSF) in 1922. The women who joined the CPSF were primarily members of two older feminist groups, the Montreal Suffrage Association and the FNSJB. Besides Dessaulles-Béique and Gérin-Lajoie, among the founding members of CPSF were Thérèse Casgrain, Carrie Derick, Grace Ritchie-England, Idola Saint-Jean, and Isabella Scott. For the women of the FNSJB, this was a significant change in stance, as the organization had been formed with approval by the pope to train women in their moral and civic responsibilities as wives, rather than as individual citizens. The struggle for the right to vote in Quebec continued to 1940, when women won full suffrage.
Death and legacy.
Dessaulles-Béique died on 8 August 1946 in Montreal. The Housewife's School which she founded became affiliated with the Université de Montréal in 1937 and in 1953 became the School of Household Science. In 1959, it merged with the University when the school decided to offer a degree in home economics. In 1988, a street in the city was renamed in her honour.

The Castillet (or Castellet, "small castle") is an ancient fortification and city gate located in Perpignan (Pyrénées-Orientales, France). Today, this monument, a strong symbol of the city, has become a museum: Museu Català de les Arts i Tradicions Populars ("Catalan Museum of Popular Arts and Traditions").
The Castillet was made of three parts : the "big Castillet", the "small Castillet" (former city gate), and a polygonal bastion. The bastion was destroyed in the early 20th century, but the big and small Castillet were saved from demolition.

Edith G. Stedman

Edith Gratia Stedman, OBE (December 29, 1888 - July 16, 1978) was an American social worker, educator, writer and volunteer. She is best known for her vocational programming created at Radcliffe starting in the Great Depression and also for her help in restoring Dorshester Abbey.
Biography.
Stedman was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts and the family later moved to Belmont, Massachusetts where she attended high school. Stedman enjoyed high school, writing, "I think I worked harder and got more academic pleasure out of some of my work in high school than I ever did in college." She went on to Radcliffe College where she graduated in 1910.
After school, she worked for a time at the Framingham Reformatory for Women until her brother convinced her to quit in order to run the family's candy store, a job she later discovered she hated. After two years, she quit and went to Europe with the YMCA to help the war effort there in 1917. She was a canteen worker in France and Germany working for the YMCA until 1919. Back in the United States, Stedman did not find work that interested her. Stedman then traveled to China in 1920, where she worked as a medical social worker in Hankou at an Episocopal Mission. She stayed until 1927, returning to Boston, where she started working as an executive secretary for the Judge Baker Foundation.
Ada Louise Comstock invited Stedman to come for the Appointment Bureau at Radcliffe in 1930. Stedman developed vocational programs for women in the 1930s. Undergraduates and graduate students were both helped by Stedman in finding employment. She created and directed the Training Course in Personnel Administration and supported professional training for women. Stedman worked as the director of the Training Course until 1941. Students could be awarded a fellowship grant in her name. Stedman stayed at Radcliffe until 1954, when she retired.
As a retiree, she worked as a volunteer in different capacities. Between 1955 and 1959, Stedman volunteered at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. In 1959, she started spending half the year living with friends at the Manor House, Dorchester. Stedman created a group, the American Friends of Dorchester Abbey, which raised money for both the Abbey and the surrounding gardens. Stedman also wrote during her retirement.
Her last years were spent living in Sherrill House, a nursing home in Boston run by the Episcopal church. She suffered from Menieres disease and had deafness. Stedman died in Boston on July 16, 1978.
Legacy.
Stedman was awarded as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1976 for her work supporting the restoration of Dorchester Abbey. She was given the award at the British embassy in Washington, D.C. A stone carving of Stedman is located above the west door of the Abbey.

Pilot Grove, Texas

Pilot Grove, Texas (Sometimes referred to as "Lickskillet") is a community located in Grayson County, Texas near the "Corners" region in Northeast Texas, which is where Grayson, Hunt, Fannin, and Collin county lines intersect. It is 700 feet above sea level.
History.
The first settlement at what is now Pilot Grove was the result of French and Spanish expeditions in the area in 1836-1836. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the area was inhabited by various Caddo groups, including the Kichai, Ionis, as well as the Tonkawa.
In 1841, Bluford Clement immigrated to the area, then part of Fannin County, prior to Texas statehood. Beginning in 1857, Clement began platting Pilot Grove as well as established a general store and post office.
Lee-Peacock Feud of 1867-1871
Pilot Grove also played host to several incidents involving the Lee-Peacock Feud of the area. In 1867, Captain Bob Lee, having fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War, ran into a Unionist named James (Jim) Maddox in the Pilot Grove general store. Lee, having been held hostage by Maddox and a party of sympathizers some time earlier, offered to duel, however, Maddox declined. Later that day, Maddox shot Lee and "friends took the wounded man to the home of Doctor William H. Pierce, who took care of Lee until he was up ready to go back home. On February 24, a Union man named Hugh Hudson came to Pierce’s home, perhaps looking for Lee. Not finding him, Hudson shot and killed the doctor in front of his house" in Pilot Grove.
It was the birthplace of American gambling icon and mob boss Benny Binion.

River Lydden

The River Lydden is a tributary of the River Stour that flows through Blackmore Vale in Dorset, England.
Its headwaters rise at the foot of the scarp slope of the Dorset Downs near Buckland Newton. These headwaters streams coalesce south of Pulham, from where the river flows north-east to it confluence with the Wonston Brook. Continuing in a northerly direction it passes King’s Stag, to Twoford bridge where it is crossed by the A357 between Lydlinch and Bagber, beyond which it meets its main tributary the Caundle Brook. The lower Lydden then flows beneath the listed Bagber Bridge where it is crossed by a minor road, to join the Stour near King’s Mill south west of Marnhull.

1928 UK &amp; Ireland Greyhound Racing Year

The 1928 UK &amp; Ireland Greyhound Racing Year was the third year of greyhound racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
Roll of honour.
+ unofficial National Derby
Summary.
The oval track form of greyhound racing continued to rapidly grow with numerous tracks, either in the process of being constructed or opening. The Greyhound Racing Association (GRA) continued to lead the way, opening or having a financial interest in new tracks opening in Ramsgate, Cardiff, Nottingham, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Brighton and Stoke-on-Trent. The GRA also moved venues in Leeds from Fullerton Park to Elland Road Greyhound Stadium which was literally next door. Other major tracks to open included three London venues; West Ham Stadium with the capacity to accommodate 100,000 spectators, Clapton Stadium designed by the famous architect Sir Owen Williams and Wimbledon Stadium which would become one of the most prominent tracks in the industry. The latter was owned by Bill (W.J) Cearns. Three tracks also opened in Wales; White City Stadium, Cardiff, White City Swansea and Cardiff Arms Park.
The National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) was formed, the purpose of this organisation was to govern greyhound racing and the body would be responsible for regulation and the rules of racing that came into force on 23 April. The NGRC consisted of twelve stewards usually chosen from military or police backgrounds. The first stewards included E.A.V.Stanley, Lt General Sir Edward Bethune and Major B.D.Corbett. The rules of racing were introduced and updated annually and any track wishing to be associated with them were required to agree to the rules and apply for licences. Tracks that were not licensed were called independent or 'Flapping' tracks, the latter description was not welcomed by the independent tracks. Calendars were formulated containing information for all licensed personal and anyone falling foul of the rules was subject to investigation and punishment. A passport or official identity book for every greyhound was introduced and was a vital component to ensure the policing of greyhounds at every track. 
The total annual attendance across the country for 1928 increased to 13 million 695,275 from 5,656,686 (in 1927).
With the rise in popularity there was also the growth of opposition to greyhound racing. In March a decision by Salford City Council to cease permitting advertisements of greyhound races on the back of tram tickets was passed by a vote of 26 to 14. 
Competitions.
Six new major events were inaugurated during the year. The Cesarewitch at West Ham and St Leger at Wembley for stayers and the Scurry Gold Cup at Clapton for sprinters were introduced in London. Three national Derby competitions were started - the Scottish Greyhound Derby at Carntyne, the Welsh Derby at Welsh White City (Cardiff) and the Irish Greyhound Derby at Harolds Cross. The Welsh Derby was not considered a classic event at this stage.
Mick the Miller.
The first great champion of greyhound racing emerged when on 18 April, Mick the Miller won on debut at Shelbourne Park but was overshadowed by his brother Macoma five days later. Macoma also trained by Horan broke the world record time for 500 yards beating the existing record holder Kriesler in a time of 28.80 sec. Later in the same month the pair went to Celtic Park to contest the Abercorn Cup and during a gallop Macoma caught his leg in the mesh traps breaking his hock. Mick the Miller finished third in the final but made a name for himself when equaling the world record of 28.80 at Shelbourne, a race sandwiched in between the semi and final at Celtic Park. Then Mick the Miller was struck down with distemper. There were no vaccine available and his chances of survival were slim but Arthur 'Doc' Callanan, who was the manager of Shelbourne Park as well as being a qualified veterinary surgeon on site nursed him back to health. In the August, both Mick the Miller and Macoma were put up for sale by Father Brophy. Macoma was sold for 290 guineas but Mick the Millers reserve was not met, a fortunate moment for his owner Father Brophy.
Ireland.
The Irish Derby was unofficial because Harolds Cross decided to run a 'National Derby' without consulting the Irish racing authorities. This was a practice they would continue to do until the formation of classic races in 1932. Also in Ireland it was clear that the 1926 Betting Act passed by the Oireachtas, Dáil Éireann was benefitting the Irish government with funds from the tax it received from gambling. The 5% off course tax and 2.5% on course tax also seemed to be a catalyst for new track builds in Ireland. However a proposed government amendment to tax the unregulated Irish flapping tracks was defeated 66 votes to 48. In Ireland the Harolds Cross Parish Church held sermons called "The Moral Challenge of Greyhound Racing" and the "Religion and the Gambling Spirit".
1928 Unofficial Irish Derby.
The winner of the 1928 Irish Greyhound Derby was Tipperary Hills. On Thursday 16 August, Tipperary Hills (Billy Quinn), Curristown (John Shannon) and Happy Man won the semi finals. Tipperary Hills defeated PJ Graham's Battle Island by one length in 30.72 sec, Curristown defeated Gilly Gooly by two lengths in 30.95 sec and the third and final semi final was won by Happy Man (M Hammond) from False Favourite (C Forde) by four lengths in 31.10 sec.

Home Sweet Home (2014 film)

Home Sweet Home is a 2014 Indian Konkani language comedy film written and directed by Swapnil Shetkar and starring John D'Silva, Rajdeep Naik and Aryan Khedekar. The film is produced by Swapnil Shetkar and Madhav Gad under the banner of Go Goa Gollywood Productions. This film is inspired from real life incidents of land scam in Goa. It was released commercially all over Goa on 26 December 2014 and became an instant hit with unprecedented box office performance for a Konkani film despite being pitted against Amir khan starrer PK, one of the biggest Hindi film. It ran for 101 days in Goa during its initial release and completed a record number of 600 shows. This film has completed more than 1000 shows theatrically by December 2016, thus becoming the most successful konkani film on the box office.
Plot.
The film is about John D' Silva, who migrates to U.S. after the death of his parents leaving his ancestral house in Goa called "Home Sweet Home" to be looked after by his one and only friend Kaytan. When he returns to Goa after 20 years, he is shocked to see a huge residential complex standing in place of his ancestral house. Only the famous landmark, old Holy Cross outside the complex, stands there to convince the taxi driver Raj that it is the same location for certain.
Now it becomes very crucial for John to find out the mystery behind this and Kaytan is the only person who can help them solve it but soon John and Raj get one more shock when they come to know that Kaytan stays in the very same complex.
The relation between John and Raj, that of customer and driver turns into close friendship during the course of these events and they decide to fight for justice. During this tough journey John comes across various social issues, colourful characters and vast transformation in Goa that has taken place during his stay in U.S. Eventually they conclude that it is time to raise their voice to demand the justice and change the "SUSHEGAD"(laid-back) image of Goans.
As Raj &amp; John unearth more &amp; more evidence it becomes clear that this whole thing is part of the "biggest but most silent" land scam run by powerful and greedy builders with the help &amp; blessings of politicians. Raj &amp; John risk their life to expose this scam and the people involved in it.
Production.
This film is inspired from land scams happening in Goa. One incident in particular is in which Arjuna awardee Dr. Otilia Mascarenhas saw her ancestral property in Porvorim fraudulently 'sold' to a land shark. This was a time when Goa had hardly one or two theatrical konkani releases in a year, that too in maximum of 2 screens so the filmmakers had to produce the films by themselves as no producer was ready to fund the project. It was made on a very minimal budget. The film was shot at various real locations in Goa. Principal photography began on 18 October 2014 and went on till 3 November 2014.
Release.
The film was released commercially all over Goa on 26 December 2014 in 12 Screens. The premiere of the film, held at Inox Panjim was attended by then Honourable Defence Minister of India, Mr. Manohar Parrikar as the chief guest. Every show was houseful for the first week. It complete 100 houseful shows in 14 days. It ran for 84 days in 12 screens and completed 101 days in 6 screens resulting in more than 1000 shows theatrically.
Due to limited numbers of screens the producers came up with an alternate way of taking the film to the audience. The film was screened in Auditoriums like Ravindra Bhavan all over Goa, Panchayat halls and church halls. Special screenings were also arranged in remote villages of Goa by renting equipments like projector, screen and 5.1 surround sound system.
After its successful performance in India the word of mouth spread and there was a huge demand for the film from Konkani speaking community in Gulf countries. So far 7 special screenings have taken place in Dubai, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Muscat &amp; Oman.
Home Sweet Home was also screened in IFFI 2015.
Home Sweet Home was also re-released on 15 January 2016, three weeks after the successful release of its sequel Home Sweet Home 2 - Now the game will be rough
In October 2016, the film was also made available out of India on a digital portal called goencho balcao.
Accolades.
The film won 6 awards in the 8th Goa State Film Awards including the award for best screenplay, best director and second best feature film.

Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park

The Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park () covers an area of 1,796 km² and is thus one of the largest nature parks in the German state of Bavaria.
Landscape.
The nature park covers the whole territory of the county of Cham and the eastern part of the county of Schwandorf. In the northwest it borders the Upper Palatine Forest Nature Park, in the east, the Czech Republic, and in the south on the Bavarian Forest Nature Park. Its highest summits are the Großer Osser (1,293 m), Hoher Bogen (1,079 m), Kaitersberg (1,133 m), Enzian (1,285 m), Schwarzeck (1,238 m), Zwercheck (1,333 m) and Kleiner Arber (1,384 m). The proportion of forest today is about 40 percent. 76 percent of the nature park territory is protected and 2,084 hectares have been designated as nature reserve.
Geology.
The mica schist on the Osser and the chalk transgression in the Obertrübenbach Quarry are among Bavaria's most attractive geotopes. In addition to the dominant crystalline bedrock of granite and gneiss there are various sedimentary layers, siliceous and calcareous rocks, ancient limestones, mica schists and, in the geological feature of the 150-kilometre-long Pfahl ridge, quartzite and slate, which in places form rock pinnacles and towers. Guided tours in the "Fürstenzeche Lam" are offered for mineral collectors.
Nature.
The spignel plant, which occurs in these mountains and from which the "Bärwurz" spirit is distilled, is well known. In some meadow valleys, rare orchids are found. For bird lovers, the Regentalaue nature reserve west of Cham with the Rötelseeweiher ponds offers good opportunities for observation.
