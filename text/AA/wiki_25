Caroline Bowen

Caroline Bowen (born 4 December 1944) is a speech therapist who was born in New Zealand, and who has lived and worked in Australia most of her life. She specialises in children's speech sound disorders. Her clinical career as a speech-language pathologist spanned 42 years from 1970 to 2011.
Biography.
Bowen studied speech therapy in Melbourne, graduating from the Victorian School of Speech and Hearing Science with a LACST (Licentiate of the Australian College of Speech Therapists, a forerunner of the Australian Association of Speech and Hearing, later to become Speech Pathology Australia) in 1970, and received her PhD degree in 1996 from Macquarie University, Australia. She also has qualifications in Speech and Drama from Trinity College London (ATCL performer 1964; LTCL teaching 1966) and a diploma in Family Therapy (1989) from the now disbanded Family Therapy Institute of Australia.
She has worked extensively across Australia, Ireland and the UK and is regarded as an international expert in both clinical fields of children's speech sound disorders and in the use of technology to improve speech pathology practice. She is a Senior Honorary Research Fellow in Linguistics at Macquarie University in Australia, and an Honorary Research Fellow in Speech-Language Pathology at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.
In 2008 Bowen was elected as a fellow the American Speech–Language–Hearing Association. In 2011 she was made a life member of Speech Pathology Australia and in 2014 became an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. She is the only Australian, and only speech-language pathologist, to be awarded high honours by all three of these professional organisations.
Dr Bowen's other professional interests include evidence-based practice; the role of families in speech-language pathology intervention; developmental language disorder; the impact of treatment fads, complementary and alternative medicine and pseudoscience on clinical and education practice (e.g., the Arrowsmith Program, Brain Gym, Facilitated Communication, Irlen, Learning Styles, the Rapid Prompting Method, Whole Language, etc.); and the application of information and communication technology, including social media, for professional purposes. Dr Bowen has also been a pioneer in the use of the Internet in Speech Pathology. Her own website and her Phonological Therapy listserv have facilitated worldwide communication of the highest standard within the profession.
She consulted on the 2010 film The King's Speech, the 2010 book of the same title by Lionel Logue's grandson Mark Logue with co-author Peter Conradi, and the 2010 book "Lionel Logue – The King's Mentor" by Norman C. Hutchinson.
She is the child speech and language development consultant for the Bing TV series.
In 2018 she was appointed an honorary Member of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day Honours.

Portsmith

Portsmith is a suburb of Cairns in the Cairns Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the population of Portsmith was 195.
History.
Portsmith is situated in the Yidinji traditional Aboriginal country. The origin of the suburb name is from an early pioneer named William Smith.
Geography.
The suburb consists of two distinct areas: the north-western part which is the mainland (adjacent with suburbs Woree, Bungalow, Parramatta Park and Cairns City) and the south-eastern part which is a pair of islands (Admiralty Island and a smaller unnamed island) bounded to the west by Smiths Creek and to the east by Trinity Inlet. The mainland part is developed land while the islands are undeveloped. The entire suburb is flat low-lying land, less than 10 metres above sea level.
The mainland part is principally used for industrial purposes with those nearest Smiths Creek being used for maritime purposes such as boat building, shipping services, trawlers and fish markets.
Ray Jones Drive/Bruce Highway is an arterial road that runs from the south-west to the north-east through the mainland area (being known at the north-east end as Comport Street). The North Coast railway line runs south and roughly parallel with the arterial road with the Portsmith railway station and Portsmith railway yards serving the suburb.

Muscle Bound

"Muscle Bound" is a song by the English new wave band Spandau Ballet, released as part of the third single from their debut album "Journeys to Glory". In the UK, it was released as a double A-side with the song "Glow"; elsewhere, "Glow" was included as the B-side. "Muscle Bound" received mostly good reviews, and the combined single was their third consecutive top 20 hit in their native UK, reaching number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. The music video for "Muscle Bound" was more ambitious than their previous promotional clips and went over budget because of snowy weather that caused delays during the location shoot.
Background.
Spandau Ballet had a number 5 hit with their debut single, "To Cut a Long Story Short" and reached number 17 with their follow-up, "The Freeze". In a May 1982 interview with "New Sounds New Styles" magazine, their guitarist/songwriter, Gary Kemp, explained that the band wanted all of the singles from their debut album, "Journeys to Glory", to use the same motif on their covers as the album itself. Graham Smith was credited with their design and was inspired by the works of John Flaxman for the cover of the "Muscle Bound" single, which was released on 23 March 1981. When "New Sounds New Styles" asked about working with Smith on the cover art for "Journeys to Glory", Kemp commented, "We enjoy playing with imagery, but at that time everyone was taking us far too seriously." To give an example of a lighter moment from the album, he said, "'Muscle Bound' was quite tongue-in-cheek," and explained, "I've always liked folk music since I was really young, and 'Muscle Bound' was like a folk song with quite a funny lyric." He "didn't think that a folk song of that kind" had ever reached the pop charts in the UK and described it as "an experiment". In his autobiography he called it "a unique blend of constructivist propaganda, Russian folk music and slow-jive disco (pompous was fashionable then), all inspired by a typically Blitz-dreamt European nostalgia."
Music video.
The Kirkstone Pass in the English Lake District was chosen as the filming location for the music video because it looked like the Russian Steppe. Russell Mulcahy was hired to direct, and it wound up costing more than double its original budget of £15,000 and taking longer than the one scheduled day to film because the area had just received several feet of snow. Mulcahy was only partially successful in getting all of the band members to ride horses; when Kemp was thrown from the thoroughbred he was given and knocked unconscious, drummer John Keeble became unnerved, dismounted and refused to get back on. Lead singer Tony Hadley, on the other hand, insisted on continuing to ride when Mulcahy felt weather conditions were too dangerous. Spandau Ballet's guitarist/saxophonist, Steve Norman, noted in 2021, "You wouldn’t have dwarves in a video now like 'Muscle Bound' does, but that was very much of its time." Kemp believed that the amount of footage gave the video a large-scale feel and created a bit of a competition with Duran Duran to have Mulcahy "make even more ambitious videos for them".
Critical reception.
Although "The Rolling Stone Album Guide" found "Muscle Bound" to be "thin and monotonous", the song otherwise received good reviews, including one from the "New Musical Express" proclaiming that it "shrivels the LP under its heat [and] makes those other singles sound like tinny, teenybop jingles." Betty Page of "Sounds" magazine appreciated the "romantic, poetic imagery that is not insipid or starry-eyed but powerful and thoughtful". Dylan Jones thought it was "a clever, seductive spin on body politics". Dave Thompson of AllMusic called it "a sweaty slab of twilight homoerotica that really is as beefy as its title suggests," and categorized all three songs from the album that were released as singles as "utterly convincing white boy Funk".
Release and commercial performance.
"Muscle Bound" was issued on a double A-side single, paired with "Glow", which was written after the recording of "Journeys to Glory" was completed. The single began 10 weeks on the UK pop chart on 4 April and got as high as number 10 and reached number 97 in Australia, number 18 in Ireland, and number 32 in the Netherlands.
In addition to the album version of "Muscle Bound", the 2010 CD reissue of "Journeys to Glory" included the 7-inch version as well as a recording of the song taken from a March 1981 BBC session.

Dracaena braunii

Dracaena braunii is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It was named after the German collector Braun, Johannes M. (1859-1893). Most plants named "Dracaena braunii" in cultivation are "Dracaena sanderiana", a plant with flowers five times longer than those of "D. braunii", while the leaf base is not congested as in "D. braunii".
Description.
Short stemmed, usually unbranched, stoloniferous herb to 10–30 cm high, forming extensive dense carpets, leaves equitant, roots bright orange-red, some plants forming dwarf shrublets to 50 cm high on grey more or less erect stems. Leaves bright to dark green and shiny above concolorous, paler and dull beneath, polymorph, sessile, short and long petiolate leaves even on the same plant, lanceolate, smooth thin coriaceous, lamina to 15 cm long and 4 cm wide, leaf tip descending, gradually tapering into c. 1 cm mucro acuminate to caudate, mucro to 1 cm long, base cuneate. Pseudopetiole green, caniculate when short petiolate, furrowed on the upper side when long petiolate, gradually extend into a short sheathing base, clasping the stem for distinctly more than its circumference.
Inflorescence smooth, green below towards purple near the top, terminal, erect, spicate, to 30 cm long, bracts, 2-4, lanceolate ligulate, green with purple base, to 50 mm × 4 mm, early caducous, distally decreasing in size, flowers clustered 5–7 cm near the top the spike. Flowers white to cream, lobes pinkish purple tinged, 1-3 per fascicle, each fascicle subtended by narrowly triangular early caducous, scarious bracts c. 1 mm long, pedicel 1–2 mm long. Flower 12–19 mm long, lobes longer then the tube, reflexed. Flowers with a faint sweet smell. Fruits orange to red, 1-3 lobed, lobes globose to ellipsoid, diverging, c. 12 mm × 10 mm, subsessile.
Distribution and habitat.
"Dracaena braunii" is native to Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and the Republic of the Congo. It is found at the edge of coastal forests and the transition between mangrove and savannah, in shade, laterite to sandy soil, also on rocks, tolerating sea spray from the surf, at altitudes of 0–20 m.

Anne Cecil, Countess of Salisbury

Anne Cecil, Countess of Salisbury (9 August 1693 – 22 March 1757), formerly Lady Anne Tufton, was the wife of James Cecil, 5th Earl of Salisbury. 
She was the daughter of Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet, and his wife, the former Lady Catharine Cavendish. She and her elder sister Catherine (later Viscountess Sondes) were friendly with Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea, whose poem "A Nocturnal Reverie" praises Anne. Anne was known to Anne Finch by the poetic pseudonym, "Lamira".
On 12 February 1709, Anne married the earl, who had succeeded his father in the earldom in 1694. They had four children:
The earl died in October 1728, aged 37, and was succeeded by their only son, James.
Anne's youngest daughter, Margaret, died in 1752 of smallpox, at the home of her eldest daughter, Catherine, Countess of Egmont, in Pall Mall, London. Another daughter, Anne, died later in the same year.
The Countess Anne school in Hatfield, founded in 1735, was named after the countess, but the original charity school closed in 1912, to be replaced by the current Church of England school.

Passive autocatalytic recombiner

Passive autocatalytic recombiner (PAR) is a device that removes hydrogen from the containment of a nuclear power plant during an accident. Its purpose is to prevent hydrogen explosions. Recombiners come into action spontaneously as soon as the hydrogen concentration increases. They are passive devices because their operation does not require external energy.
Hydrogen may be generated in a nuclear accident if the reactor fuel overheats and zirconium cladding of the fuel rods reacts chemically with steam. If the hydrogen is released from the reactor to the containment, it may get mixed with air and form a flammable or even explosive mixture. A hydrogen explosion could break the containment and cause radioactive materials to be released to the environment. Recombiners aim at removing hydrogen and thereby preventing explosions.
Inside a recombiner there are plates or pellets that are coated with platinum or palladium catalyst. On the surface of the catalyst, hydrogen and oxygen molecules react chemically already at low temperature and low hydrogen concentration. The reaction generates steam. The reaction starts spontaneously when the hydrogen concentration reaches 1–2 percent. Burning of hydrogen in air requires at least 4 percent hydrogen concentration, and even higher for an explosion. So, a recombiner is able to remove hydrogen from the containment before a flammable concentration is reached.
A recombiner is a box that is open from the bottom and from the top. The catalyst is located at the lower part of the box. The reaction of hydrogen and oxygen on the catalyst surface generates heat, and temperature in the recombiner reaches hundreds of degrees Celsius. Hot steam is lighter than the air in the containment, so buoyancy is caused inside the recombiner, much like in a chimney. This causes a strong airflow through the recombiner, feeding hydrogen and oxygen from the containment to the device.
Hundreds of kilograms of hydrogen may be generated in a few hours during a severe reactor accident. For example the most efficient recombiner made by Framatome (formerly Areva) removes slightly over five kilograms of hydrogen per hour, when the hydrogen concentration is four percent. Therefore several recombiners are needed. For example the containment of Olkiluoto 3 EPR in Finland has 50 recombiners.
Manufacturers of passive autocatalytic recombiners include Framatome, SNC-Lavalin (formerly Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd, AECL), and German Siempelkamp-NIS.

Iaroslav Sviatopolkovich

Iaroslav Sviatopolkovich, also known as Iaroslav or Yaroslav Sviatopolchich (1070s – 1124), was Prince of Vladimir-in-Volhynia from 1100 to 1118.
Early life.
Iaroslav was the second son of Sviatopolk Iziaslavich (who was the youngest son of Iziaslav I Iaroslavich, Grand Prince of Kiev). Iziaslav fled to Poland after his brothers, Sviatoslav Iaroslavich and Vsevolod Iaroslavich, dethroned him in 1073. Sviatopolk accompanied his exiled father. Historian Márta Font proposes that Sviatopolk had most probably fathered children by the time he left Kievan Rus'.
One ""Gerasclauus", the son of the king of the Ruthenians" was listed among the witnesses of the deed of foundation of the Somogyvár Abbey in 1091. The document also recorded that "Gerasclauus" was the son-in-law of Ladislaus I of Hungary. Font associates "Gerasclauus" with Iaroslav, because Iaroslav's good relationship with the Hungarian kings is well-documented. She says that Iaroslav most probably married Ladislaus I's daughter in the early 1090s. In 1097, his father sent Iaroslav to Hungary to persuade Coloman, King of Hungary to support him.
Prince.
Iaroslav's father, Vladimir Monomakh, Oleg and Davyd Sviatoslavich assembled at Uvetichi on 30 August 1100. They summoned David Igorevich, the Prince of Vladimir-in-Volhynia to their conference. They dispossessed David Igorevich and gave Vladimir-in-Volhynia to Iaroslav
Along with other Rus' princes, Iaroslav and his father accompanied Vladimir Monomakh to a campaign against the Cumans as far as the river Don in early 1111. Their united troops defeated the Cumans at Sugrov on 27 March.
Sviatopolk Iziaslavich died in Kiev on 16 April 1116. Iaroslav was staying in the town when his father died, but the townspeople offered the throne to Vladimir Monomakh. Monomakh accepted the offer and came to Kiev on 20 April.
In exile.
Iaroslav first fled to Hungary to seek assistance from Stephen II of Hungary. He allegedly soon left Hungary for Poland, because he launched several campaigns against his former principality at the head of Polish troops from 1118, according to the Kiev Chronicle (in the Hypatian Codex). Vladimir Monomach always repelled his attacks.

2018 Dapchi schoolgirls kidnapping

On February 19, 2018 at 5:30 pm, 110 schoolgirls aged 11–19 years old were kidnapped by the Boko Haram terrorist group from the Government Girls' Science and Technical College (GGSTC). Dapchi is located in Bulabulin, Yunusari Local Government area of Yobe State, in the northeast part of Nigeria. The Federal Government of Nigeria deployed the Nigerian Air Force and other security agencies to search for the missing schoolgirls and to hopefully enable their return. The governor of Yobe State, Ibrahim Gaidam, blamed Nigerian Army soldiers for having removed a military checkpoint from the town. Dapchi lies approximately 275 km (170 miles) northwest of Chibok, where over 276 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram in 2014.
Five schoolgirls died on the same day of their kidnapping; Boko Haram released everyone else in March 2018, save the lone Christian girl Leah Sharibu who refused to convert to Islam.
Controversies.
Military withdrawal shortly before kidnapping.
Ibrahim Geidam, the governor of Yobe State, has complained about the withdrawal of army troops from Dapchi allegedly just hours before the abduction, without informing either the local police or the state government in advance. Initially, the army remained silent regarding this complaint. Days later the army made seemingly contradictory claims attempting to explain its withdrawal. The army claimed that it had withdrawn its forces from the town due to the absence of evidence of any Boko Haram activity in the general vicinity and that at the time, it had formally handed over Dapchi's security to the police before its withdrawal. In an army intelligence document obtained by the Sahara-Reporters group dated Feb. 6, 2018, an army general expressed concern regarding a possible imminent Boko Haram attack in adjacent Damaturu, 60 miles away, thus calling into question the army's earlier assertion that it had good reason to believe that Boko Haram had left the general vicinity. The Yobe state police commissioner strongly denied the army's claim that his department had been formally informed by the army of the army's withdrawal, and no proof of any such police notification was provided by the army.
Uncertainty regarding number of abductees.
Initially the Yobe governor stated that 94 schoolgirls were kidnapped from the school and that 48 had returned to their parents and that only 46 are still missing. While, Bashir Manzo, the chairman of the Forum of Missing Dapchi Schoolgirls Parents said that 105 girls were missing. The police commissioner of Yobe, Abdulmaliki Sunmonu said that 111 schoolgirls were missing.
Comparison to Chibok kidnapping.
As in the recent Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping, so too in the Dapchi kidnapping, the Nigerian government took days to respond at all, and then responded with several assurances that the kidnappers would be promptly apprehended and that all of the girls would soon be returned safely to their homes. In the Chibok event, four years later still approximately a third of the abductees remained in the hands of Boko Haram, with those girls who have been released, for the most part having been released via ransom payments, and with only one low-level kidnapper having been apprehended and standing trial to date (Mar. 5, 2018). Meanwhile, Boko Haram continues to enrich itself via the millions of dollars thus far paid to it by the Nigerian government in the form of ransom payments.
Reactions.
The Nigerian Bar Association urged the Federal Government to suspend boarding schools in Northeast Nigeria. Parents and villagers of Dapchi narrated how the kidnapping occurred and urged the Nigerian government to help them bring back their girls unharmed.
Release.
On 21 March 2018 the Federal government of Nigeria announced that Boko Haram terrorists had returned 106 of the kidnapped children, including 104 girls who went to school, one girl who did not and a boy. Leah Sharibu wasn't released and her parents told Agence France-Presse that the group would only release her if she converted to Islam. The group dropped them off in the town in nine vehicles. Information minister Lai Mohammed stated that the release was unconditional. But days later, the United Nation stated in its report that the government had paid a huge ransom for the release.
The fighters after releasing the girls warned their parents not to put them in school again. Some of the kidnapped girls stated that five of the schoolgirls had died on the same day they were kidnapped by the terrorist group.
Leah Sharibu.
Leah Sharibu, a Christian schoolgirl aged fourteen at the time of her capture, is the only remaining Dapichi schoolgirl still held hostage. After the others were released, some told "The Guardian" newspaper that Sharibu had previously escaped from her abductors, but was intercepted and returned to her abductors by a nomadic Fulani family. Sharibu was reportedly not released along with the other children, because she refused to convert to Islam.
According to Christian Solidarity Worldwide, Sharibu subsequently was given to a Boko Haram fighter as a slave. In August 2018 an audio was released of Sharibu pleading for her freedom. In October 2018 her parents revealed that Boko Haram had threatened to kill her later that month, should the government not meet their demands.
In February 2019 social media reports circulated about her death, but were dismissed by the government as politically motivated disinformation.
After spending almost two years in captivity, in January 2020, many news outlets widely reported that Sharibu had given birth to a baby boy after being forcefully converted to Islam and married off to a Boko Haram commander. Her father, Nathan Sharibu dismissed the report saying that he would not want to hear such news.
Many sources later reported that she gave birth to a second child late in 2020.

Human trafficking in South America

Human Trafficking or "trafficking in persons" is the recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing, or obtaining a person for mainly the purposes of forced labor or prostitution. However, other reasons for human trafficking is for the removal of organs, forced marriage, and other exploitations. South America is one of the biggest source and destination locations in the world and has struggled with the issue for many years. The ILO estimates that of the 20.9 million victims of human trafficking in 2012, 1.8 million were from Latin America. There are many factors that cause human trafficking, like a high demand for domestic servants, sex laborers, and factory workers, the existence of already established trafficking networks that often take advantage of young women and children, corruption in the governments and local law enforcement agencies, a governmental disinterest in the issue and a lack of opportunity for women in South American regions where trafficking occurs. People who are typically exploited in human trafficking are impoverished, a member of an indigenous people, unemployed, victim of some kind of abuse, illiterate, substance users, is homeless and/or associated to gang activity. Research done by United States Department of State has also stated that there is a vulnerability for the LGBTQ+ and transgender people to be caught up in human trafficking. By far, sex trafficking is the leading type of human trafficking, making up 79 percent of all human trafficking. This is then followed by forced labor at 18 percent. About 20 percent of trafficking victims are children. Primary destinations for trafficking and illegal immigration are the United States, Spain, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Canada. Globalization, capitalism and societal attitudes facilitates and reduces the barriers to human trafficking in the world today.
History of human trafficking in the region.
The commercial use of humans within Latin and South America has been acknowledged since 1928 by the League of Nations. The commercial use of humans is mostly consisted of women and children. In 2000, human trafficking gain a lot of attention due to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act passed by the United States. While the act is a US policy, the act also consist of an anti-trafficking efforts that by the US to stop human trafficking in its southern neighbors. Currently, Latin America is the third largest source of trafficked humans. There is various theories as to why Central America, in particular, has seen increase cases of human trafficking. One theory is that due to the upheaval and political turmoil that occurred after the Spanish withdrew, crimes such as forced servitude and sexual exploitation increased without being checked. There it is the normalization of human exploitation that was left behind from colonialism. The acceptance of human exploitation stems from marginalization practices such as racism. The cultivation of conditions that allowed for human trafficking in Latin America can be dated back to the arrival of the first conquistadors in the 16th century.
Since the 15th century there's been a continuous pattern of exploitation and extraction of the land and people inhabiting that region. First with the Spanish, then the dictatorships that replaced, and recently along with the dictators is neoliberalism. With neoliberalism, there are outside companies paying workers close to nothing wages while over working them. Due to past civil wars, lack of government regulation, and instances of past violations against human rights, Latin and South Americans have become exceedingly distrusting of their current governments. This situation makes it ideal for human traffickers to traffic people.
Types of human trafficking.
Sex trafficking.
Sex trafficking is the practice of kidnapping people, typically young women and children, to be forced into the practice of sexual slavery and prostitution. Sex trafficking is the most common form of human trafficking. According to a report by the UNODC, 79 percent of trafficking is for sex trafficking. Typically, people with histories of sexual assault or sexual violence and people who live in poverty are targeted and kidnapped. According to State Department officials, it is estimated that tens of thousands of Latin American women are trafficked each year, typically internationally. A large number of these victims come from Colombia or the Dominican Republic. According to a report made by the United Nations in 2016, multiple gangs, crime families, and drug trafficking organizations deal in human trafficking which may involve some 48,500 victims. These women and usually children are trafficked into prostitution, but can also be forced to work in pornography or stripping. Argentina and Brazil are very common destination countries for women from the Andes and some places in the Caribbean, like the Dominican Republic and Panama is a destination country for women from Colombia and Central America who are forced to work in the sex trade. Trafficking is a common occurrence along borders in Central and South America. The Mexican-Guatemalan border is especially popular due to undocumented migrants en route to the United States are often pushed into prostitution.
Forced labor.
Forced labor is the practice of intimidating a person into performing types of labor, through intimidation or violence. The ILO reported that in 2012, about 1.8 million people in Latin America were laborers in forced labor. These numbers included victims of human trafficking. These numbers are estimated to be roughly 3.1 percent of the regions population, though it does not count the victims of human trafficking who are sent out internationally. Typically, men are approached by people looking for workers in urban areas where poverty and unemployment are common. From the 2014 UNODC report males make up anywhere from 67 to 70 percent of the trafficked victims for forced labor. These people promise good pay for work and often transport the workers to ranches and mines in remote areas. This is a common practice or occurrence in place like Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay where people are often forced to work on cattle ranches, lumber mills, cole mines and plantations where soy beans, cotton and corn are produced. Upon reaching their destination, the workers are told they are now in debt, and held in debt bondage. They are told that transportation costs will be taken out of their salaries. Other times, the workers aren't brought to the work site, but to a drop off point, where they sometimes wait for days or weeks for employers to come pick them up. Food, lodging and transportation are taken out of their salary, and they are held until their debt is paid. The indigenous people of Latin America are also highly susceptible to being taken into forced labor. Typically, they live in poverty and with discrimination and a low literacy rate working against them, they have no real way to protest against the laborers effectively. It is estimated that annually, about 1.5 million seasonal farm workers who are mostly from Latin America and the Caribbean Islands harvest produce in the United States. There have been an increasing amount of abuses due to forced labor because of the low wages, harsh working conditions, lack of legal protection and an increasing demand for cheap labor.
Trafficking of children.
Typically, children are trafficked in countries that have large tourist attractions and centers on sex tourism. Street and orphaned children are the most vulnerable to be taken advantage of by traffickers, though there have been cases where the trafficked children still live with their family, and participate in commercial sexual activities to provide for the family. Some other factors that make a child vulnerable to becoming a victim of trafficking are poverty, infrequent attendance of school, involvement in criminal activity, drug or alcohol addiction, or physical or sexual abuse. 
Children are typically trafficked for the uses of illegal adoptions, child soldiers, sex slavey, or to work for an organized crime group. State Department officials estimate that roughly 1 million children work as domestic servants in Latin America and that 70 to 80 percent of unaccompanied children travel with smugglers. The UNODC noted that children made up 30 percent of the trafficked victims in the Americas.
Structural factors that contribute to human trafficking.
Links to organized crime.
People are often trafficked by criminal organizations such as criminal gangs or mafia groups. Typically, organized crime groups take part in the sex trade and trafficking practice. In Guatemala, organized crime groups kidnap and transport women from other countries, often other Latin American countries, to participate in prostitution and sexual slavery. According to the Bilateral Safety Corridor Coalition, organized crime groups from Russia, Japan, Mexico, Central America, Ukraine and multiple other countries have been caught attempting to traffic people across the U.S.-Mexico border. The State Department states that there is evidence of children being forced to commit crimes in Ecuador, Chile, and Brazil.
Supply and demand of capitalism.
Human trafficking is unique in that the supply and demand are the same thing. The high demand for human bodies incentivizes the exploitation and dehumanization of human beings. In a SAGA publication there is an approximation of 32 billion dollars the human trafficking industry generates annually. Supply and demand of human trafficking is normalized in capitalist societies where consumers feel it is their right to receive the services they paid for. Giving a monetary value to humans, makes those selling them see them as object and their property.
Due to the supply and demand of humans, the final destination for trafficked humans correlates with tourism. Tourism and sexual exploitation are positively correlated in modern day cities in Latin America.
Stigma and societal attitudes.
Additional factors that perpetuates human trafficking, forced labor, and forced prostitution are stigmas and attitudes a society has in regard to individuals in the human trafficking industry. Research done by Jo Bindman, claims in general sex workers face significantly higher discrimination by law enforcements, governmental authority and society. This presents an issue concerning human trafficking as those who are unwilling forced into sex work are at a disadvantage of receiving help due to the conversation around sex work.
Systemic inequality.
Due to inequality and disparities that result from globalization and the lack of regulation, there are certain groups who are more vulnerable than others of becoming victims of human trafficking. These groups include and is not limited to individual who are impoverished, lack job opportunities, queer, and/or engage in harmful cultural traditions. Those who are living in poverty and lack the opportunity to at acquire a safe, honorable job are easily susceptible to the deceiving, manipulative tactics of human traffickers. In their desperation, people find themselves in the human trafficking system.
Illegal immigration.
Some people go to traffickers looking to be brought into a new country, typically illegally. The most common countries people are brought to are The United States, Britain, Italy, Canada, Spain and the Netherlands. These countries have come to rely on migrant workers doing jobs in agriculture, construction, manufacturing and domestic service for low paying wages. Because of a concern about job competition, security and many other issues related to taking in large amounts of foreign-born populations, this has caused many of these countries to strengthen and tighten their border security. Though this has only caused a rise in illegal immigration. Many people from Guatemala and Belize travel through Mexico to get to the United States border. Because of the increasing security along the borders, smugglers will take more dangerous routes, which makes the smuggling more costly. To pay for this, smugglers will force the migrants into forced labor or prostitution. According to Zdrojewski, many of the trafficked women and children in Central America originate from Nicaragua, Dominica Republic and Guatemala. Most immigration is from the south to the north, to the United States.
Efforts to combat human trafficking.
Human Trafficking is underreported making for there to be a substantial amount of data missing concerning human trafficking. The two reasoning behind this is one the inadequate legislation surrounding and lacking of testimonies from victims and witness. Most of the underrepresented types of human trafficking fall in categories of forced labor, domestic servitude, forced marriage, organ harvesting and children trafficking. In 2000, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, also known as the Trafficking Protocol, supplements the United Nations convention against transnational organized crime. Its intended person is to prevent and fight against human trafficking by facilitating international corporation. Since the creation of the protocol more countries are implementing laws in effort to prevent further human trafficking. Human Trafficking in Latin America did not become a central issue until the late twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first century, after the U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act and the Trafficking Protocol from the United Nations. The TVPA has provided funding to support local efforts against trafficking.
Socially, there is an increase awareness about the issue and how to best support the victims. There are programs training individuals to recognize and care for human trafficked victims. However, many Latin American countries find it make progress against trafficking because they lack the resources and political power to enforce existing programs. Much of their resources and time goes into other issues such as drug trafficking and gang violence. Many countries even lack shelters for trafficked victims and follow up plans after the victim is freed.

Release.
"The Times of India" gave the film a rating of four out of five stars and noted that "Those looking at a getaway for three hours in a cinema hall for some laughs, a little tears and a story that is soulful and satisfying, this is definitely recommended". "Deccan Herald", on the contrary, gave the film a rating of three out of five stars and stated that "We are offered a Hollywood-ish upgrade of the romantic film, with some bows in the direction of the Hindi film "Queen". The romantic bits are, quite frankly, sahasra-yawny despite their being carefully underplayed and adroitly avoiding Nicholas Shakespeare territory." Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion South wrote "The beats are generic, but the lovely cast and the freshness of the filmmaking, I think, could make Katheyondu Shuruvagide the Pelli Choopulu of Kannada cinema...there’s not one ill-considered frame (the cinematography is by Sreeraj Raveendran), and the aesthetics add to the experience, which holds you in the mood of a folk song hummed around a campfire."

Lotus tenellus

Lotus tenellus is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae, native to the Canary Islands. Some authors have included "L. tenellus" in "Lotus glaucus", a species found in Madeira and the Salvage Islands. "L. leptophyllus" may be treated as a synonym of "L. tenellus" or as a separate species. "L. tenellus" has yellow flowers, with usually no more than three flowers in each flower head (umbel). Its leaves are made up of five leaflets.
Description.
"Lotus tenellus" is a perennial herbaceous or shrubby plant. The leaves are either unstalked (sessile) or have a very short petiole, and are made up of five pinnate leaflets. The two basal leaflets are 1–5 mm long. A short axis (rhachis) 1–2 mm long, shorter than the basal leaflets, separates them from the other three leaflets, which are 2–7 mm long, usually longer than the basal leaflets. The stems and leaves have either straight hairs which lie flat along the surface or curved upright hairs – sometimes a mixture of the two. The hairs are not particularly dense, so that the surface is clearly visible. The yellow flowers are arranged in umbels, usually with one to three flowers, occasionally up to four. The peduncule (stem) of the umbel is two to six times as long as the subtending leaves. The upper petal (the standard) is nearly as long as the keel petals, being 9–14 mm long. The wing petals are usually just shorter than the keel at 8–13 mm. The fruit pods are straight.
Taxonomy.
"Lotus tenellus" was first described, as "Pedrosia tenella", by Richard Thomas Lowe in 1862. Lowe created a new genus, "Pedrosia", for some species of "Lotus". (The genus is now usually treated as "Lotus" section "Pedrosia".) Lowe distinguished "Pedrosia tenella" ("Lotus tenellus"), found in the Canary Islands, from "Pedrosia glauca" ("Lotus glaucus"), found in Madeira. Subsequent authors did not accept either his genus or this distinction, sinking "Lotus tenellus" into "Lotus glaucus". A survey of "Lotus" sect. "Pedrosia" in 2006 accepted Lowe's separation of the two species, transferring his "Pedrosia tenella" to "Lotus".
Lowe distinguished "Pedrosia tenella" ("Lotus tenellus") from "Pedrosia leptophylla" ("Lotus leptophyllus"). Some sources accept "Lotus leptophyllus" as a distinct species. A 2006 survey of "Lotus" section "Pedrosia" treats "L. leptophyllus" as a synonym of "L. tenellus".
Distribution and habitat.
"Lotus tenellus" is found in the coastal zone of Tenerife and Gran Canaria.

Enoploteuthis leptura

Enoploteuthis leptura, the hooked enope squid, is a species of squid from the family Enoploteuthidae. It is the type species of the genus "Enoploteuthis", which is in turn the type genus of the Enoploteuthidae.
Description.
"Enoploteuthis leptura" have hooks on their arms, less on arms I-III than on arms IV, the males have many tiny papillae covering the oral surfaces of arms I-III. In males right arm IV is hectocotylised and has a flap created by an expansion of the ventral protective membrane and there are about six pairs of hooks on the distal third of the arm on the opposite side to the flap. On the dorsal side the protective membrane expands a little to create a series of small flaps on the other side of the arm from the large flap made by the ventral membrane. The tentacles are long and slender and the tentacular club is narrow with two rows of hooks on its manus, a ventral series having 6-7 large hooks and a dorsal series with 4-5 smaller hooks. The dactylus has 10-15 suckers in two series and there is a long, thin carpal cluster. The ventral mantle has six series of complex photophores on the anterior integument with a seventh series which curves either to the left or right to join with one of the nearby series and so does not extend to the anterior mantle margin. On the ventral, anterior edge of the mantle there is a discontinuous row of photophoresin which the gaps correspond to the spaces between the series of photophores on the mantle. The ventral surface of the head has six series of photophoresin which the outermost series are interrupted by a ventral window in the skin. There are no photophores between these ventral windows and the photophores on the eyelids. They grow to a mantle length of 92mm.
Distribution.
"Enoploteuthis leptura" has been recorded from the Gulf of Guinea, the eastern and western central Atlantic Ocean from Bermuda and Madeira in the north to Brazil and southwestern Africa in the south. The Indo-Pacific species "Enoploteuthis magnoceani" is considered by some authorities to be a subspecies of "E. leptura".
Habitat and Biology.
"Enoploteuthis leptura"is a mesopelagic squid which occurs in the warmer water areas of the Atlantic. Increment analysis of statolith growth of specimens collected from the Gulf of Guinea showed that it has a short life span of approximately 6 months with individuals attaining sexual maturity in 45–60 days in males and 80–90 days in females. The maximum age is 153 days for mature males and they had grown to 72mm mantle length with females living to 143 days and attaining a mantle length of 92mm. Spawning occurs throughout much of the year up to September in the Gulf of Guinea with two peaks occurring in January and June–July. This species is a vertical diel migrant, i.e. they spend the day at depths and move upwards towards the water surface at night to feed.

Six-petal rosette

The six-petal rosette is a design with six-fold dihedral symmetry composed from six "vesica piscis" lenses arranged radially around a central point, often shown enclosed in a circumference of another six lenses.
The design is found as a rosette ornament in artwork dating back to at least the Late Bronze Age.
Construction.
The pattern figure can be drawn by pen and compass, by creating seven interlinking circles of the same diameter touching the previous circle's center. The second circle is centered at any point on the first circle. All following circles are centered on the intersection of two other circles.
The expansion of the design into a regular overlapping circles grid is also known as "Flower of Life". Bartfeld (2005) describes the construction: "This design consists of circles having a 1-[inch] radius, with each point of intersection serving as a new center. The design can be expanded "ad infinitum" depending upon the number of times the odd-numbered points are marked off."
History and folk art.
The design is attested from at least the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, represented, for example, on ornamental golden disks found in Shaft Grave III at Mycenae (16th century BC).
It is also found in some Cantabrian stelae, dated to the Iron Age. In ancient art, the ornament occurs alongside other patterns, such as eight-petal rosettes as well as arrangements of swirls or spirals, and the attribution of any kind of significance to its occurrence is purely speculative. Peralta Labrador (1989) cites a proposal according to which the design in the La Tène (Celtic) period was a solar symbol associated with the god Taranis.
The six-petal rosette is common in the early modern (17th to 18th century) folk art of the Alpine region, in the Pyrenees (Cantabria, Navarre, Aragon), and parts of Eastern Europe.
In Portugal, it is common to find it in medieval churches and cathedrals, as the engraved signature of a mason; but also as decoration and symbol of protection on the chimneys of old houses in Alentejo (at times together with the lauburu, or with Solomon's pentagram).
The design is also known as "Sun of the Alps" ("Sole delle Alpi") in Italy from its widespread use in alpine folk art. It resembles a pattern often found in that area on buildings. It is used in the coat of arms of Lecco Province. It has also been used as the emblem of Padanian nationalism in northern Italy since the 1990s. In 2001, "Editoriale Nord", the publishing company of "La Padania", registered the green-on-white design as a trademark.

Political Tribes

Political Tribes: Group Instinct and the Fate of Nations is a book by Yale professor Amy Chua. It was published in February, 2018, and covers the topic of how loyalty to groups can be more important than ideology, and applies this idea to both failures of American foreign policy abroad and the rise of Donald Trump within the United States.
Reception.
The book was criticised by "The Guardian", which stated that it was "a well-intentioned book that never quite comes together. The "Financial Times" stated that it was an important book, and supported Chua’s argument "that America’s liberal elite has contributed to Trump’s rise by failing to acknowledge its own sense of tribalism"; it did, however, also state that it left the "crucial question" of how to create a "non-tribal world" unanswered.
The book was praised by author J. D. Vance, a former student of Chua and author of "Hillbilly Elegy", saying that ""Political Tribes" is a beautifully written, eminently readable, and uniquely important challenge to conventional wisdom."

Chimaericola leptogaster

Chimaericola leptogaster is a species of polyopisthocotylean monogenean in the family Chimaericolidae. It is ectoparasitic on the gills of the chimaera "Chimaera monstrosa".
History.
According to Brinkmann, the species was discovered as early as 1828 on the gills of chimaeras off Norway by Rapp and was given a scientific name by Friedrich Sigismund Leuckart in 1830, as "Octobothrium leptogaster", but Leuckart did not see the animal. The species was then mentioned by Félix Dujardin and Karl Moriz Diesing, who also did not see the specimens. However, Diesing transferred the species to the genus "Discocotyle" but also considered the species as "species inquirenda". Later, in 1858, Diesing transferred the species to the genus "Placoplectanum". Olsson redescribed the animal in 1876 and used again the name "Octobothrium leptogaster". The species was shortly redescribed by Parona &amp; Perugia in 1892.
Finally Brinkmann redescribed the species in details in 1942 from material collected off Norway and Sweden.
Morphology.
"Chimaericola leptogaster" is a large monogenean, reaching 50 mm in length. The haptor, at the posterior end of the body, bears eight clamps arranged as two rows of four.
Modern works.
The first molecular sequences obtained from "Chimaericola leptogaster" suggested that the Chimaericolidae were a basal group within the Polyopisthocotylea.
"Chimaericola leptogaster" was studied with transmission electron microscopy. Several organs have been investigated in details: vaginae, clamps, digestive system, and spermiogenesis and spermatozoa. These ultrastructural results have confirmed the basal position of the species in comparison to marine Polyopisthocotylea.

Yanyarrie is a locality in the Australian state of South Australia located on the eastern side of the Flinders Ranges about north of the state capital of Adelaide and about and north of the municipal seat of Orroroo.
The locality’s boundaries were created on 16 December 1999 for the “local established name” which is derived from the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Yanyarrie whose northern side is occupied by the locality and ultimately from an aboriginal word meaning “Kangaroo Urine”.
Land use within the locality is ’primary production’ and is concerned with “agricultural production and the grazing of stock on relatively large holdings.”
The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Yanyarrie had a population of 5 people.
Yanyarrie is located within the federal division of Grey, the state Stuart, and the local government area of the District Council of Orroroo Carrieton.

Shapira Scroll

The Shapira Scroll, also known as the Shapira Strips or Shapira Manuscript, was a set of leather strips inscribed in Paleo-Hebrew script. It was presented by Moses Wilhelm Shapira in 1883 as an ancient Bible-related artifact and almost immediately denounced by scholars as a forgery.
The scroll consisted of fifteen leather strips, which Shapira claimed had been found in Wadi Mujib (biblical Arnon) near the Dead Sea. The Hebrew text hinted at a different version of Deuteronomy, including the addition of a new line to the Ten Commandments: "You shall not hate your brother in your heart: I am God, your god." The text also lacks all laws except for the ten commandments, which it renders consistently in the first-person, from the standpoint of the deity. Scholars took little time to reject it as a fake, and the shame brought about by the accusation of forgery drove Shapira to suicide in 1884.
Shapira's widow had at least part of the scroll in 1884, which she sent to . The scroll reappeared a couple of years later in a Sotheby's auction, where it was sold for £10 5s to Bernard Quaritch, who later listed it for £25. Contemporary reports show Dr. Philip Brookes Mason displayed the "whole of" the scroll at a public lecture in Burton-on-Trent on March 8, 1889. The current whereabouts of the scroll, if it survives, are unknown.
Discovery of the scroll.
Shapira's account of the discovery of the scroll varied at times and the differences between them have been used as evidence of forgery. , the first person Shapira showed the scroll to in person, recalled:
Mr. Shapira did not wish to tell me the provenance of the manuscript. He only told me that it came from a tomb beyond the Jordan.
While in Germany, Shapira told Hermann Guthe that:At the end of July or the beginning of August a certain Selim of the tribe of Adachaje ... offered in the Shapira shop a blackish stripe of leather for sale. Shapira himself was not present and found the cheaply acquired leather in the store on his return. As Salim was unable to visit Jerusalem, he had asked his friend, the Sheik, Mahmud of Abu Dis near Jerusalem, to arrange a meeting with Salem which, finally, brought all the strips into Shapira's possession.Another is contained within a handwritten letter from Shapira to Professor Hermann Strack of Berlin on 9 May 1883:
In July 1878 I met several Bedouins in the house of the well-known Sheque Mahmud el Arakat, we came of course to speak of old inscriptions. One Bedouin . . . begins to tell a history to about [sic] the following effect. Several years ago some Arabs had occasion to flee from their enemies &amp; hid themselves in caves high up in a rock facing the Moujib (the neues Arnon [sic]) they discovered there several bundles of very old rugs. Thinking they may [sic] contain gold they peeled away a good deal of Cotton or Linen &amp; found only some black charms &amp; threw them away; but one of them took them up &amp; and [sic] since having the charms in his tent, he became a wealthy man having sheeps [sic] etc.
Shapira wrote a letter to Ginsburg in early August, informing him that:In July 1878, the Sheik Machmud Arakat, the well-known chief of the guides from Jerusalem to the Jordan, paid me the customary visit . . . [as] the Sheik hat Bedouins of the East in his house, he brought them all with him . . . I heard the next day . . . some men of his acquaintance had hidden themselves, in the time when Wali of Damascus was fighting the Arabs, in caves hewn high up in a rock . . . near the Modjib. They found there several bundles of old black linen. They peeled away the linen and . . . there were only some black inscribed strips of leather, which they threw away (or I believe he said threw into the fire, but I am not certain); but one of them picked them up . . . I asked the Sheik to employ him as a messenger to bring me some of the pieces that I might examine them, but the Sheik thought that that man would not do it, but he knew a man who was not superstitious at all . . . In about twelve days I got four or five columns . . . in eight days more he brought me about sixteen; in eleven or twelve days more four or five . . . I have not seen the man again. The Sheik died soon, and I lost every trace that would enable me to follow the object further.In an account to the Palestine Exploration Fund on July 20, 1883, Shapira said that:[H]e first heard of the fragments in the middle of July 1878. A Sheikh, with several Arabs of different tribes came to him at his place of business in Jerusalem on other matters. The Sheikh had nothing to do with antiquities. They spoke of some little black fragments of writing in the possession of an Arab. They had been found in the neighborhood of Arnon. One of the Arabs spoke of them as talismans, smelling of asphalte. The day following Shapira was invited to dinner by the Sheikh, and heard more about the fragments. About the year 1865, at a time of persecution, certain Arabs had hid themselves among the rocks. There, on the side of a rocky cavern, they found several bundles wrapped in linen. Peeling off the covering they found only black fragments, which they thew away. They were picked up by one of the Arabs, believing them to be talismans . . . Shapira promised the Sheikh a reward if he would bring to him an Arab he spoke of who would be able to get hold of the fragments. This happened on the day of the dinner. The Sheikh fell ill, and afterwards died. About ten or twelve days after the dinner, a man of the Ajayah tribe brought to him a small piece . . . a week later, he brought fourteen or fifteen columns . . . the next Sunday, fourteen or fifteen more . . . ten days after, on Wednesday, he brought three or four columns, very black. Shapira saw nothing more of him.Claude Reigner Conder received yet another version from Shapira, which attributed the scroll and the Moabite forgeries to the same location and claimed a mummy had been found with the scroll.
Presentation of the scroll.
In Germany.
On 24 September, 1878, Shapira sent copies to Konstantin Schlottmann, who had wrongly authenticated Shapira's Moabite forgeries in 1870. Schlottmann consulted with Franz Delitzsch and then denounced the scroll as a fabrication. Delitzch published separately in his journal "" in 1880, calling it a fake. 
On 9 May 1883, Shapira wrote a ten-page letter to Hermann Strack, saying he'd trust Strack's judgement over his own with regard to the scroll's authenticity. Strack replied on 27 May, declaring "that it was not worth [Shapira]'s while to bring such an evident forgery to Europe." Also in May 1883, Shapira showed one piece of the manuscript to , then the German consul in Beirut, for a short time in poor light; he refused to authenticate it without longer study of all the fragments.
In June 1883, perhaps having revised the text, Shapira brought the scroll to Germany in an attempt to sell it to the Royal Library of Berlin. Karl Richard Lepsius, then the Library's keeper, convened a symposium of leading Bible scholars in Berlin (Lepsius himself, Eduard Sachau, Eberhard Schrader, August Dillmann, Adolf Erman, and Moritz Steinschneider), to evaluate the scroll on July 10; these unanimously declared it a fake after a 90-minute inspection. In a separate German analysis in the first week of July, published August 14, Hermann Guthe and Eduard Meyer concluded the scroll was a forgery; Theodor Nöldeke and Emil Friedrich Kautzsch were said to agree. Shapira also showed the scroll to Strack in person, whose view did not change. The Royal Library offered to buy it at a lower price, to enable German students to study the forger's technique; Shapira took it to London instead. The German scholars did not publicize their findings, and other experts' conclusions were reached independently.
In London.
On July 20, Shapira informed the secretary of the Palestine Exploration Fund that he had brought the manuscript to London, and on July 24 he showed the manuscript to the Fund's Walter Besant and Claude Reignier Conder. On July 26, he displayed the manuscript to a large number of British scholars at the Fund's offices, even tearing off a portion to demonstrate the parchment's interior; the manuscript was then taken to the British Museum for further inspection. 
Shapira sought to sell the scroll to the British Museum for a million pounds, and allowed the Museum to exhibit two of the 15 strips. The Museum designated Christian David Ginsburg to evaluate the strips, and he published transcriptions, translations, and facsimiles over the following weeks. On August 4, 1883, Walter Flight of the British Museum reported that much of the leather looked ancient but the margin of one piece looked brand new; on August 17, Edward Augustus Bond, principal librarian of the British Museum, indicated that he too thought they were fake.
On August 13, Adolf Neubauer, who had earlier exposed Shapira's fake "coffin of Samson", identified the scroll as a forgery; on August 19, he published further arguments against its authenticity, as did Archibald Sayce on the same day. Neubauer's identification was later called the scroll's death knell. 
The French Ministry of Public Instruction's Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, who had earlier revealed Shapira's Moabite forgeries, arrived in England on the 15th, already harboring "most serious doubts." He obtained a quick look at some fragments from Ginsburg, but was quickly banned by Shapira from further studying the scroll. However, Clermont-Ganneau closely examined the two strips on display at the public exhibition on August 18 and, on August 21, he declared them to be forgeries. Claude Reignier Conder also declared them fake on the 21st, and Ernest Renan, Albert Löwy, and Charles Henry Waller soon followed. By August 25, the Grantham Journal reported, "The official verdict on the authenticity of Mr. Shapira's manuscripts has not been given but the published evidence of experts who have examined them is unanimous against it." 
On August 27, Christian David Ginsburg, who as the designated philological examiner of the British Museum had been given access to the entire scroll, published the same conclusion. Earlier that week, the British Museum had ceased to display Shapira's strips. Ginsburg also suggested the shape of the strips, their ruling, and the leather used matched Yemenite scrolls Shapira had sold in previous years. Clermont-Ganneau later made the same assessment. Schlottmann, Delitzch, Strack, and Steinschneider, amazed at the ongoing situation in England, each published their July findings for the British audience in September. Ginsburg and Clermont-Ganneau published their final reports that same month.
Aftermath and scroll's fate.
Ginsburg's conclusion drove Shapira to despair, and he fled London.
In spite of writing to Ginsburg that he would leave for Berlin, he fled London to Amsterdam instead, leaving the manuscript behind, and from Amsterdam he wrote a letter to Edward Augustus Bond, principal librarian of the British Museum, begging for reconsideration of the manuscript. In both letters, Shapira reaffirmed his belief in the scroll's authenticity. Six months later, on 9 March 1884, he shot himself at the Hotel Willemsbrug in Rotterdam.
Shapira's widow, Anna Magdalena Rosette, had at least part of the scroll in 1884, as evidenced by a note in the Ginsburg file left by Bond. Rosette sent "two small pieces" to Schlottmann for further study in 1884. It later appeared in an auction at Sotheby's in 1885 and it was purchased by Bernard Quaritch, a bookseller, for £10 5s. Two years later, Quaritch listed the scroll for sale for £25 and displayed it at the Anglo-Jewish Historical Exhibition in 1887.
In 1970 Professor Alan David Crown, on the basis of a misreading of a letter from Sir Charles Nicholson to Walter Scott wherein Nicholson claimed that "most" of the Shapira manuscripts had fallen into his hands, advanced the hypothesis that Nicholson had acquired the Shapira Scroll itself, with the scroll destroyed in a fire in Nicholson's London study in 1899, along with most of his collection. Apart from Nicholson's hyperbole - he is only known to have acquired six Torah scrolls compared to the 167 manuscripts acquired in 1884 by Adolph Sutro - Nicholson never wrote that he acquired the Shapira scroll itself. Crown's hypothesis was widely accepted as the best explanation of the scroll's fate.
In 2011 Australian researcher Matthew Hamilton identified the actual owner of the scroll, the English doctor and natural historian, Dr. Philip Brookes Mason. Contemporary reports show Dr. Philip Brookes Mason displayed the "whole of" the scroll at a public lecture in Burton-on-Trent on March 8, 1889. Further whereabouts of the scroll, if it survived, are unknown.
Features of the scroll.
Physical appearance.
Shapira's scroll was composed of fifteen leather strips, some easy to read and others blackened to the point of near-illegibility. Each complete strip was extremely narrow, about 3.5 inches by 7 inches. Each complete strip had an average of ten lines of writing on one side only. They were folded, not rolled. Each complete strip was folded between one and three times, for a total of 40 folds. They were covered in dark glutinous matter and had a faint odor of funeral spices or asphalt, known in the nineteenth century for their use in Egyptian mummification. Each segment had one rough edge and one smooth edge, consistent with a top or bottom margin recently cut off an older manuscript. Each segment had vertical creases marked with a hard point as a scribe would mark for columns, but the text of the Shapira scroll has no relation to these lines, weaving in and out of them randomly, suggesting that a forger had taken the blank margin of a marked Torah scroll and written his text ignoring the faint column lines. Ginsburg and Clermont-Ganneau suggested that the material was identical to the leather of the medieval Yemenite Torah scrolls in which Shapira had dealt in the preceding years. The outline of a frame could be seen, perhaps used to administer aging chemicals, and the straight edge of one segment looked new.
Script.
The scroll is written "scriptio continua" except in the Decalogue, a style never discovered in other Hebrew manuscripts but widely assumed by Shapira's contemporaries to have been the original form of the text. In the Decalogue, every word is followed by an interpunct except לא, "do not", and nota accusativi. The writing, by multiple hands, more closely resembles that of inscriptions like the Mesha Stele, already published by 1878, than it does the Paleo-Hebrew writing later found on parchment; even in the nineteenth century the similarity was thought suspect. André Lemaire authored a recent paleographic analysis (1997):However, the letter shapes do not correspond exactly to any known ancient West Semitic script. It is neither Moabite (although most letters seem like imitations of Moabite writing in the Mesha Stele, which records the ninth-century B.C.E. Moabite king Mesha's victories over Israel...) nor "Canaanite" (West Semitic writing from about the 13th to the 11th century B.C.E.). It is neither the Hebrew script used during the First Temple period nor the archaizing paleo-Hebrew script found on coins of the First Jewish Revolt against Rome (66–70 C.E.) and the Second Jewish Revolt (132–135 C.E.) and in several of the Dead Sea Scrolls. In truth, after a simple look at the facsimile, an experienced paleographer can see it is a forgery.Ginsburg reported that some strips were duplicates in different hands, with very slight differences (noted "infra").
Spelling and wording.
The text uses Moabite spellings, made famous by the Mesha Stele in 1870 but never attested in any Israelite text or on parchment; some aberrant plene spellings, as of יום and סיחן, further suggested forgery. The text omits some consonantal yods as well, suggesting an erroneous attempt to replicate Moabite spellings. The scroll contains several apparent misspellings, ungrammatical phrases, and words from later Hebrew, which featured prominently in the negative assessments of its authenticity. The scroll often replaces Deuteronomic words with close synonyms, including ירא &gt; פחד, שכב &gt; בעל, קצפ &gt; אנפ, לפנים &gt; מעלם, and more; these synonyms are not always exact, resulting in incongruent grammar, and sometimes rely on later meanings unattested in Biblical Hebrew.
Modern scholarship.
Despite the near unanimous assessment of the 19th century scholars who had access to the manuscripts that they were a forgery -- an exception being Eduard Meyer who in correspondence to Georg Ebers expressed the view that the strips were genuine and noted that examination of the leather by Dr. Franz Adolf Hofmann found nothing suspicious -- there have always been researchers who believed that the Shapira scroll might have been a genuine ancient artifact after all.
Professor Menahem Mansoor, chairman of the Department of Hebrew and Semitic Studies at the University of Wisconsin, argued in 1956 that re-examination of the case would be justified. (Mansoor's conclusion was immediately attacked by Moshe H. Goshen-Gottstein and by Oskar K. Rabinowicz.) Likewise, J. L. Teicher (1957). More recently, Shlomo Guil (2017) and Idan Dershowitz (2021) have argued forcefully that the strips were genuine.

The 1st Argyll &amp; Bute Artillery Volunteers was a part-time unit of the British Army's Royal Artillery formed in Scotland in 1860 in response to a French invasion threat. It 1908 it became the only Mountain Artillery unit in the Territorial Force, and saw action at Gallipoli and Salonika during World War I. Before World War II it became the first Territorial Anti-Tank unit. One of its successor units was captured at Saint-Valery-en-Caux during the Battle of France, but others saw action in the campaigns in North Africa and Sicily, and in from D Day to VE Day, including Arnhem and the Rhine Crossing. It continued in the postwar Territorial Army until 1955.
Artillery Volunteers.
The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle and Artillery Volunteer Corps composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need. The 1st Administrative Brigade, Argyll Artillery Volunteers, was formed with headquarters (HQ) at Oban, on 10 October 1861 to include the following corps of Argyllshire Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVCs):
In 1863 the 1st Bute Artillery Volunteers at Rothesay (raised on 20 March 1862) were added to the unit. In 1867 the 2nd Bute Artillery Volunteers from Millport, Cumbrae (raised on 5 October 1867) were also added to the unit. In 1864 brigade HQ moved to Lochgilphead, and in 1870 to Rothesay. In May 1880 the brigade was consolidated as the 1st Argyll and Bute Artillery Volunteers, with twelve and a half batteries, distributed as follows:
In 1887 a new 12th battery was formed at Rothesay, and in the following year the 8th Battery moved to Dunoon.
Royal Garrison Artillery.
In 1882 all the artillery volunteers were affiliated to one of the territorial garrison divisions of the Royal Artillery (RA) and the 1st Argyll &amp; Bute AVC became part of the Scottish Division. In 1889 the structure was altered, and the corps joined the Southern Division. In 1899 the RA was divided into separate field and garrison branches, and the artillery volunteers were all assigned to the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA). When the divisional structure was abolished their titles were changed, the unit becoming the 1st Argyll &amp; Bute Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers) on 1 January 1902, with its HQ at Tarbert.
During the South African War in 1900, 211 men of the 1st Argyll and Bute volunteered their services, but only eight were accepted for active service.
The corps was one of the most scattered in Britain. For example, No 6 Company had detachments at Bowmore, Bridgend, and Ardbeg. Personnel of the corps were spread over fifteen localities in some of the largest and least accessible country in Scotland. Owing to the varying occupations of the men, 75% were Gaelic-speaking, three training camps were arranged at different times of the year. In addition the corps had to maintain 15 carbine ranges. Many prizes were won by the corps, both in gun practice and repository exercises, at the Scottish National Artillery Association camps - the King's Cup was won at Barry Buddon in 1903 by the Easdale companies. The pipe band consisted of over thirty pipers.
Territorial Force.
When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908 the bulk of the personnel of the 1st Argyll &amp; Bute RGA (V) formed IV (4th) Highland (Mountain) Brigade, RGA, while the remainder formed one company of the Forth and Clyde Royal Garrison Artillery. The new brigade, which included the Lochcarron, Ross-shire, company from the former Highland Artillery Volunteers, was the only TF mountain artillery unit. It formed part of the Highland Division and had the following organisation:
IV Highland (Mountain) Brigade, RGA
The batteries were equipped with the 10-pounder mountain gun, a 2.75-inch calibre 'screw gun' originally developed for the Indian Army's mountain batteries.
World War I.
Mobilisation.
The Highland Division received a warning order for mobilisation on 29 July 1914, and the order to mobilise was received at 17.35 on 4 August. IV Highland Mtn Bde arrived at Bedford on 10 August, where the division concentrated over the following days. During the winter of 1914–15 a number of units left the division to join other formations in the field. On 10 March 1915 IV Highland Mtn Bde (except the Bute Bty) transferred to the 29th Division. This was a new division formed mainly from Regular Army units returned from stations round the Empire, and was allocated to the forthcoming Dardanelles operation. The battery left from Avonmouth Docks on 16 March, bound for Malta and then Alexandria, where it disembarked.
Gallipoli.
29th Division re-embarked at Alexandria and landed at Cape Helles on the Gallipoli Peninsula at 07.00 on 25 April 1915. IV Highland Mtn Bde and its two batteries served through the difficult opening weeks of the campaign with 29th Division, including the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battles of Krithia and the Battle of Gully Ravine, before transferring to 11th (Northern) Division on 29 July. The 11th was a newly arrived formation of 'Kitchener's Army' volunteers recruited since the outbreak of war. It was concentrating on the island of Imbros for a fresh landing on the peninsula at Suvla Bay, which was carried out on 7 August. This landing was no more successful than the first, and the campaign bogged down again. Once at Suvla the Argyll Battery transferred to the command of another Kitchener formation, the 10th (Irish) Division, on 8 August, followed by the rest of the brigade on 13 August.
The IV Highland Bde fought with 10th (I) Division through the campaign, including the Battle of Hill 60 and the following trench warfare. When the division was withdrawn on 30 September the artillery, including IV Highland Bde, remained in action until the final evacuation of Suvla on the night of 19/20 December, when every gun was successfully withdrawn without loss.
Salonika.
After the evacuations from Gallipoli, the troops were transported back to Egypt for rest and reorganisation. The IV Highland Bde was classed as 'Army Troops' with the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in the Suez Canal defences. In September 1916 the brigade was sent to Salonika as reinforcements for the Macedonian front. The Bute Battery, which had remained behind in Scotland and later England with the second line troops of the Highland Division (later the 64th (2nd Highland) Division), sailed direct from England to Salonika, disembarking on 20 September. Each mountain battery in Macedonia had four of the improved 2.75-inch mountain guns.
The Macedonian Front was another area of stationary trench warfare until late in the war, when the final offensive began on 1 September 1918. IV Highland Bde and its batteries were allocated to different formations as required. The brigade was with 28th Division from December 1916 until 22 July 1918, when the Bute Bty went to 27th Division. The rest of the brigade left 28th Division on 10 September to come under XVI Corps before joining 26th Division on 23 September. The Bute Bty left 27th Division on 8 September when it went to XVI Corps, returning on 23 September. On 25 September the battery rejoined IV Highland Bde, which had left 26th Division and was then operating with 14th Greek Division as the campaign came to a successful end.
Interwar.
The unit reformed in 1920 under the command of Lt-Col W.H. Macalpine-Leny, DSO, as the 26th Highland Pack Brigade, RGA with HQ at the Drill Hall at Tarbert. The Bute Bty (initially listed as 102 (Howitzer) (Bute) Pack Bty) had a Cadet Corps affiliated to it. The TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921 and; the RGA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery (RA) in 1924. The brigade (which was the only 'pack' unit in the TA) changed its number to 13th, with the following organisation:
The brigade changed its designation again from 'Pack' to 'Light' in 1927, but it underwent a more fundamental reorganisation in 1936 when it was converted into a field artillery unit as 54th (West Highland) Army Field Brigade:
However, this was short-lived: by the late 1930s a need for specialist anti-tank (A/T) artillery had been recognised, and in 1938 the regiment (as RA brigades were termed from that year onwards) became the first such unit in the TA as 51st (West Highland) Anti-Tank Regiment.
World War II.
Mobilisation.
The TA was doubled in size following the Munich Crisis of 1938, with existing units splitting to form duplicates before the outbreak of World War II. 51st A/T Regiment reorganised as follows:
51st (West Highland) A/T Rgt
61st (West Highland) A/T Rgt
The establishment of an A/T battery at this time was 12 x 2-pounder
guns organised in Troops of four guns.
51st (West Highland) A/T Regiment.
51st (West Highland) Anti-Tank Rgt mobilised at Oban under Lt-Col C.N. Roney-Dougal, MC, a Regular RA officer, and trained at Bordon Camp before crossing to France on 2 February 1940 to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) with 51st (Highland) Division.
On 22 April the division was sent for a tour of duty with 3rd French Army on the Saar Front, and took over a section of the line in front of the Maginot Line forts by 6 May.
Battle of France.
The Battle of France began on 10 May with the German invasion of the Low Countries. While the rest of the BEF responded by executing the pre-arranged Plan D and advanced to defend Belgium, 51st (H) Division stayed on the Saar Front, which remained quiet until 13 May. At 04.00 that morning the Germans began a heavy bombardment, and strong probing attacks were driven off. Attacks on the following days were half-hearted. On the night of 22/23 May the division was relieved in the line. By now German troops had reached Boulogne and cut off most of the BEF, and 51st (H) Division was ordered to move west to link up with the British 1st Armoured Division operating south of the Somme.
51st (H) Division held the line of the Bresle, but was very stretched: one battery of 51st (WH) A/T Rgt had to cover of the river. Attacks by the division against a German bridgehead over the Somme were unsuccessful, and at 04.00 on 5 June the enemy attacked all along the division's front. The Bresle line was outflanked by German "Panzers" racing for Rouen, and the division received orders to withdraw during the night of 8/9 June. During 9 June the division was cut off, and that night an "ad hoc" brigade group formed at Arques-la-Bataille and known as Arkforce was sent back to protect the approaches to Le Havre, where Operation Cycle was under way to evacuate base troops. Arkforce was formed around 154th Infantry Brigade and accompanied by 204 (Oban) A/T Bty. It set off during the night of 9/10 June, but shortly after it arrived the rest of 51st (H) Division was cut off from Le Havre. The division moved back to Saint-Valery-en-Caux where there was a chance that it could be evacuated. But Erwin Rommel's 7th Panzer Division broke through to the cliffs overlooking the harbour. 201 (Argyll) Bty fought furiously to prevent this, but one by one its guns were put out of action. 51st (Highland) Division was forced to surrender on 12 June. All of 51st (WH) Anti-Tank Regiment except 204 (Oban) Bty became prisoners of war and the regiment ceased to exist.
204 (Oban) Anti-Tank Battery.
Arkforce was successfully evacuated from Le Havre the day after the surrender of the rest of the division at St Valery. 204 (Oban) Bty was under the command of Maj Donald Carmichael, who refused to allow the men to embark until their precious 2-pdrs were safely aboard. Arkforce was taken first to Cherbourg, where a new BEF was to be formed, then evacuated to the UK on 15 June (Operation Aerial) after that attempt was abandoned.
Back in the UK, 204 became an independent A/T Bty with 29th Independent Infantry Brigade Group, a new formation made up of Regular infantry battalions brought back from India. As one of the few fully equipped formations in the UK, the brigade served with XII Corps in the most threatened area of South East England during the 'invasion summer' of 1940, then in the West Sussex County Division along the South Coast from November 1940. When the West Sussex Division moved away in February 1941, 29th Bde remained guarding the South Coast under IV Corps and South Eastern Command. 204 (Oban) Bty left on 5 May 1941 when the brigade came under War Office control to prepare for overseas service.
204 (Oban) Independent A/T Bty was with 1st (Guards) Independent Brigade Group between 11 April and 5 August 1942. When that brigade was assigned to 78th Division assembling for Operation Torch, the battery transferred on 5 August to 1st Airborne Division. On 23 October 1942 it was redesignated 2 (Oban) Air-Landing A/T Bty, equipped (with 6-pounder A/T guns) and trained for glider operations.
Air-landing battery.
The battery served with 1st Airborne in the Tunisian Campaign, but its participation in the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky) was cancelled at the last minute. A shortage of transport aircraft for the invasion of mainland Italy meant that 1st Airborne Division landed by sea at Taranto (Operation Slapstick); although the landing was unopposed, the battery suffered heavy casualties (the battery commander, Maj James Wilson, one other officer and 22 other ranks (ORs) when the mine-layer it was travelling aboard (HMS "Abdiel") struck a mine in Taranto harbour and sank.
1st Airborne Division was withdrawn from Italy in the Autumn of 1943 and prepared for operations in . The division was not called upon in the invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). A number of airborne operations were planned and cancelled before the attempt to 'bounce' the bridges up to and across the lower Rhine (Operation Market Garden) was launched. Just beforehand, 2 (Oban) A/L A/T Bty was issued with some of the newer 17-pounder A/T guns: one 6-pdr Troop was converted and three additional 17-pdr Troops organised. The new gun could be transported in the large Hamilcar glider. During the operation that battery flew in eight Hamilcars and 24 Horsa gliders from RAF Tarrant Rushton and participated in the Battle of Arnhem. After the failure of the operation, one officer and 58 ORs were evacuated across the river out of 158 who had gone in. The battery commander, Maj A.F. Haynes was among those taken prisoner.
The reduced 1st Airborne Division did not see action again, but it was sent to liberate Norway after VE Day (Operation Doomsday). By then the battery had been combined with the other A/L batteries into a new 1st Airlanding A/T Rgt. It was disbanded in November 1945 after returning from Norway.
61st (West Highland) A/T Regiment.
61st (West Highland) Anti-Tank Rgt mobilised at Rothesay in 9th (Highland) Infantry Division, the 2nd Line duplicate of 51st (H) Division. It remained training in Scottish Command until 7 August 1940 when 9th (H) Division was redesignated as 51st (H) Division to replace the original formation lost at St Valery. 244 A/T Battery left the regiment on 22 September and was replaced by 296 A/T Bty on 15 December 1941. The regiment added the 'West Highland' subtitle on 17 February 1942. 296 A/T Battery left on 10 May 1942 and was replaced by 193 A/T/ Bty. After completing training in Scotland, the division sailed for Egypt on 16 June 1942, landing on 12 August.
North Africa.
The division's first action was the Second Battle of El Alamein, for which the regiment was equipped with 16 x 2-pdrs and 48 of the new Ordnance QF 6-pounder gun. It moved up during the preceding nights, occupying gun positions and dumping ammunition, and remaining concealed during daylight. The bombardment began at 21.40 on 23 October and the advance began 20 minutes later. 51st (H) Division ran into several centres of resistance and only on the extreme left did it reach its final objective; however, the 'break-in' phase of the battle had started well. Over following days 51st (H) Division made progress towards its own objective as the 'dog-fight' phase continued. The 'break-out' phase began on the night of 1/2 November with Operation Supercharge, preceded by another powerful barrage. In the early hours of 4 November 51st (H) Division broke through to the Rahman Track, and the Axis forces began to retreat.
51st (H) Division then took part in the pursuit to El Agheila and Tripoli in January 1943. By 25 February it was past Medenine in Tunisia and facing the Mareth Line. The Axis force made a spoiling attack on 6 March (the Battle of Medenine) but there was plenty of warning. 51st (H) Division was positioned along the Wadi Zassar, a natural anti-tank ditch, and the A/T guns had been positioned to 'kill tanks' rather than protect the infantry from them. The Axis advance was easily repulsed.
The Battle of the Mareth Line began on the night of 16/17 March when 51st (H) Division took the outpost line against negligible opposition. The main attack followed on 20/21 March with another massive night barrage, but little progress was made over the Wadi Zigzaou for the first two days and the line held until it was outflanked by other forces in the south. The Axis defence collapsed on 28 March and the following day 51st (H) Division was on its way to Gabès.
The next Axis defence line was along Wadi Akarit. The barrage for 51st (H) Division's assault began at 04.15 on 6 April, and the division's attack, in the words of the "Official History", 'went like clockwork'. 61st (WH) Anti-Tank Rgt went into action with its 6-pdrs towed by tanks while the gun crews rode on the back of the tanks with their ammunition. The tanks then formed a protective screen while the A/T gunners dug in under shellfire. For the first time the regiment encountered Tiger tanks, but these remained out of range of the 6-pdrs using their longer range guns to shell the Highlanders. Axis troops then began counter-attacks and the Highlanders had to fight hard to hold their gains. Some A/T guns got through to support 7th Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (A&amp;SH), but not to 7th Bn Black Watch, who were isolated away. However, the positions were held. The pursuit was resumed the following day, through Sfax. From 22 April the division was in action in the hills around Enfidaville, until the end of the campaign on 15 May.
Sicily.
51st (H) Division then went into training for the Allied landings in Sicily (Operation Husky). Together with its 6-pdrs the regiment was issued with a few of the new 17-pounder A/T guns on the stop-gap Pheasant carriage (adapted from the 25-pounder field gun). 51st (H) Division sailed in the invasion convoy from Sfax on 8 July and the assault brigade (154 Bde) landed near Pachino at 03.00 on 10 July. There was little opposition and 241 A/T Bty's guns were got ashore and deployed at pre-arranged sites in the morning. The larger Landing Ships, Tank, arrived about 12.00 and the rest of the regiment went ashore that night. 242 A/T Battery was assigned to 153 Bde and 243 Bty to 152 Bde, while 193 A/T Bty remained with RHQ as divisional reserve. The division then moved forward to Vizzini and Francofonte, where it met its first opposition on 13 July. 243 A/T Bty fired the first rounds of the campaign at a pillbox with great effect, and thereafter the divisional policy was to have A/T guns well up with the infantry as close assault guns for use against pillboxes and machine gun posts in houses.
The division continued with scarcely a pause towards the Dittaino river, where it sent a composite force of infantry and armour ('Arrow Force') accompanied by 243 AT Bty to cross the Dittaino and attempt to capture Paternò. It achieved a bridgehead on 17 July but further advance was checked, so on the night of 20/21 July the division made an attack against the main enemy defences at Gerbini Airfield. 7th A&amp;SH made the attack supported by A Trp and half of B Trp (Pheasants) and some tanks. Although the attack succeeded, fierce counter-attacks by the Hermann Goring Division drove the Highlanders out the following morning, after which 51st (H) Division was put onto the defensive. Further counter-attacks and heavy shelling on 23/24 July led to more casualties. Because of casualties in men and guns 193 A/T Bty made use of three captured German 75 mm A/T guns and H Trp was immobilised to keep the others up to strength.
The division was relieved on 30 July and redeployed for operations against Adrano (the battles round Etna). The A/T guns were assembled at Sferro under fire, so that they could be quickly deployed as soon as the infantry were on their objectives. 51st (H) Division took its new bridgeheads over the Dittaino on the night of 31 July/1 August and the A/T guns were in action by daylight. Enemy armour put in a counter-attack at 14.00 and a few tanks got close enough to be destroyed by the A/T guns. Paternò fell on 4 August, Biancavilla on 6 August, and the division began a 'sidestep' north of Zafferana on 12 August. By now the Axis forces were evacuating Sicily, which was completed on 17 August. During the Sicily campaign the regiment lost 1 officer and 5 ORs killed, 1 officer and 40 ORs wounded, and 2 ORs missing.
51st (H) Division did not take part in the subsequent Italian Campaign, having been earmarked for Operation Overlord.
Normandy.
51st (Highland) Division was in the first follow-up wave of formations in Overlord. On 2 June 1944 it embarked at East India Docks, London, bound for Normandy and began landing on 7 June (D + 1). The first troops ashore on D + 1 included 242 A/T Bty with 153 Bde Gp and the 17-pdr Trp of 193 A/T Bty with Divisional troops. The division then got bogged down for several weeks in operations round 'The Triangle' north-east of Caen. It then supported 3rd Division's attack on the flank of Operation Goodwood on 18 July.
On 8 August 51st (H) Division spearheaded II Canadian Corps' attack towards Falaise (Operation Totalize). The attack began before dawn and by first light the break-in was going well, with a number of villages taken. 4th Canadian and 1st Polish Armoured Divisions then passed through to continue the advance. The Canadians renewed the advance to Falaise on 14 August in Operation Tractable, with 51st (H) Division attacking towards the Laison Valley on the left flank. By 21 August the Falaise Pocket had been closed and the division was advancing eastwards towards Lisieux. It was then sent across the Seine to liberate St Valery, site of the original division's surrender in 1940.
51st (H) Division then moved in for the assault on Le Havre (Operation Astonia). This was a major operation, with heavy air and artillery bombardment and armoured support, which cowed the opposition. It was followed by a similar assault to take Boulogne (Operation Wellhit), and operations to mask Dunkirk.
Low Countries.
The division next made a long move to the Antwerp area at the end of September, then spent three weeks in the line at Sint-Oedenrode. 61st (WH) Anti-Tank Rgt was deployed to cover the chain of bridges captured during Operation Market Garden, engaging occasional targets such as occupied houses or with long-range harassing fire. On 13 October 193 Bty helped drive off a 'small but well organised' German attack with their A/T guns and Bren guns, while 241 Bty contributed fire from 2-inch mortars. The regiment also practised assault river crossings, using stormboats to ferry Jeep-towed 6-pdrs and improvised pontoons with outboard motors to carry 17-pdrs and Quad tractors.
On 23 October the regiment took part in Operation Colin, a divisional attack on Schijndel. Schijndel was taken relatively easily and the division pressed on to take Vught on 25 October.
On 4 November the division began an operation against 'The Island' west of 's-Hertogenbosch with a crossing of the Afwaterings Canal. Deception shoots were carried out by 193 Bty on the right flank and by 243 Bty on the left flank, including giving covering fire from 12 Bren guns for the infantry crossing.
On 14 November the division carried out an assault crossing of the Willems Canal near Weert (Operation Ascot), then moved on to the Zig Canal and crossed that on 17 November with much less preparation. Once the canal had been bridged, 61st (WH) A/T Rgt's guns were deployed to defend the bridgehead, helped through the bad conditions by being towed by Kangaroo armoured personnel carriers.
51st (H) Division was then tasked with holding the wet low-lying country between Nijmegen and Arnhem that had been captured during Operation Market Garden, some of which subsequently had to be evacuated (Operation Noah) when the Germans broke the dykes and flooded the area. At the beginning of December the division was pulled out of the line for rest.
In December the division was suddenly moved south as part of the response to the German breakthrough in the Ardennes (the Battle of the Bulge), and then in January 51st (H) Division fought its way into the flank of the 'Bulge' in winter conditions.
In the winter of 1944–45 the A/T batteries of infantry divisions were restructured to have one Troop each of towed 6-pdrs, towed 17-pdrs and Archer self-propelled (SP) 17-pdrs on Valentine tank chassis.
Rhineland.
51st (H) Division was next engaged in the fighting in the Reichswald (Operation Veritable). It began at 05.00 on 8 February with a huge artillery preparation, after which the Highlanders attacked and were on their objectives by 23.00 that night. 61st (WH) A/T Rgt's batteries were as usual attached to the infantry brigades (and 193 Bde with RHQ), but the guns were not actually needed. On 10 February the SP Trp of 242 Bty came into action against enemy machine gun posts and houses, though several Archers of 242 and 243 Btys were bogged or damaged by enemy A/T fire. The slow advance continued through Gennep on 11 February, and the gunners suffered from enemy shellfire. One of the regiment's officers reconnoitring in a Valentine observation post (OP) tank on 12 February attacked and drove off an enemy party in the forest. On 13 February the SP guns destroyed a tank and a church steeple at Hekkens used as an enemy OP, while other gunners drove off local attacks by German paratroopers with small arms fire. On 16 February 243 Bty's SP and towed 17-pdrs supported a night attack by 152 Bde on Asperden. The final phase of the operation for 51st (H) Division began on 18 February against Goch, which was successfully taken after stiff fighting.
The division took a leading part in the Rhine crossing (Operation Plunder). The division then continued through Isselburg and Anholt.
The division reached the Dortmund–Ems Canal on 8 April. After a pause at the canal, it advanced rapidly towards Bremen against delaying actions. It reached Delmenhorst on 20 April and closed in on the centre of Bremen. The German surrender at Lüneburg Heath ended the fighting on 5 May.
61st (WH) A/T Rgt was disbanded in 1947.
Postwar.
When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the regiment reformed as 254th (West Highland) Anti-Tank Regiment with HQ at Dumbarton, forming part of 51st/52nd (Lowland) Division. In 1950 the regiment re-roled as 254th (West Highland) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment. In 1954 it absorbed 417th (Dumbartonshire) (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Rgt (originally the Clyde RGA, to which the 1st Argyll &amp; Bute Artillery Volunteers had contributed personnel). The combined regiment reverted to being 254th (West Highland) A/T Rgt, with one battery from the 417th.
Finally, on 10 March 1955 the regiment was amalgamated into the Greenock-based 277th (Highland) Field Rgt and the Argyll &amp; Bute lineage ended.
Uniforms &amp; insignia.
The original uniforms varied greatly. Colonel F. Campbell (commanding 1884-1903) wrote:'The corps had their separate uniforms, which were tunics or Garibaldi shirts, caps with red, yellow, or white bands ; belts brown, black, or white. The officers' dress was even more varied. They joined simply to encourage the movement, and wore much what they chose, utilising any old uniform that they might have worn some time or other, whether cavalry, infantry, or other. Swords of all patterns, perhaps presentations to their forefathers before and after Waterloo'.
In 1860 the 3rd Corps had blue uniforms with scarlet facings, white pouch belts, black waistbelts, and busbies. The 4th Corps wore a jumper and trousers of blue flannel, and a broad Kilmarnock bonnet, such as was usually worn by Tarbert fishermen, of whom it was mainly composed.
On the creation of the TF in 1908 IV Highland (Mtn) Bde adopted the usual brass shoulder titles consisting of 'T' over 'RGA' over the territorial designation, but in this case the three batteries adopted individual titles: T/RGA/ARGYLL, T/RGA/ROSS&amp;CROMARTY and T/RGA/BUTE.
While serving in Macedonia in 1916 IV Mtn Bde was issued with Balmoral bonnets for officers and Kilmarnock bonnets for ORs. Tartan flashes were worn behind the RA gun badge, each battery having a different tartan:
Commanding Officers.
The following served as Commanding Officer (CO) of the units:
Honorary Colonels.
The following served as Honorary Colonel of the unit:
Memorial.
There is a memorial in Stornoway to the men of 1st Ross-Shire Mountain Bty who died in Egypt, at Gallipoli and in the Balkans during World War I, and during World War II. The monument is of stone in the form of a cairn surmounted by a thistle, standing in front of the Drill Hall and TA Centre at the crossroads of Church and Lewis Streets.

Aristida rufescens

Aristida rufescens is a grass species native to Madagascar and to Mayotte in the Comoros archipelago. It was described by German agrostologist Ernst Gottlieb von Steudel in 1854.
The species is a perennial bunch grass with short rhizomes. Its culms are erect and long, with swollen nodes and hairy leaf sheaths. Leaf blades are long and 3 mm wide; they are stiff, leathery, and convolute. The inflorescence is a panicle in which each spikelet contains one fertile flower. Spikelets are lanceolate and 8.5 mm long. Upper and lower glumes have 1–2 mm long awns, and lateral lemmas have a 13–14 mm long awn, which is three-branched. The grass is a C4 plant.
"Aristida rufescens" is one of the dominant species in the grasslands of the central high plateaus of Madagascar. It is extremely fire-tolerant; although of poor quality when mature, young resprouts after fire are protein-rich cattle feed in the September to November "hungry season". In Malagasy, it is known locally as "horona", "horombohitra", "kofafa vavy", "horombavy", or "pepeka". It is used for roofing and broom-making, and its ash for medical ointments.

Dark Figure of Crime (film)

Dark Figure of Crime () is a 2018 South Korean crime drama film directed by Kim Tae-kyun. It stars Kim Yoon-seok and Ju Ji-hoon. It was released on October 3, 2018. The film was loosely inspired by the 869th episode of "", a South Korean investigation television program, which tells a real story that happened in Busan, where murders were never reported, bodies were never found, and investigations never happened.
Plot.
Kim is a widowed narcotics officer who meets with a potential informant named Kang. As they are talking at a restaurant, Kang is arrested by the homicide division for killing his girlfriend. He confesses to the murder and is put behind bars.
A few months later, Kang contacts Kim from prison and claims that he has murdered six other people. However, he refuses to talk to the homicide detectives who he claims fabricated evidence against him to have him imprisoned. Kim agrees to find the real evidence in exchange for information on the remaining six bodies. Kim uncovers the actual evidence with Kang's information, proving the homicide detectives fabricated his case. As a result, the detectives are charged and Kang's sentence is reduced. In return, Kang provides information on the six remaining victims as promised.
Of the six remaining victims, Kim first investigates the disappearance of Oh Ji Hee, a former swimmer who is forced to work at a nightclub to support her grandmother in the village. Kang claims he killed her one night after driving her away from the city while working there as a cab driver. Throughout his investigation, Kim is repeatedly told by people he questions about Kang that he is not to be trusted. Still, Kim perseveres. With much difficulty, Kang finds part of Oh's remains. However, when he is interrogated by Kim, Kang lies on record about Kim coercing him to make false statements and bribing him to do so. Furthermore, DNA results show that the remains are not Oh's. The prosecutor cannot indict Kang as the evidence against him is not convincing enough.
Kim feels cheated and goes to his former mentor, Song for advice. Song advises Kim to stop pursuing Kang's case since the murderer is trying to make himself appear innocent in other crimes to overturn the sentencing for the crime he is serving time for at present. Kim also visits Kang's older sister, who reveals Kang killed their father when he was just a boy. She helped him cover up the murder. As a result, Kang grew up to become a serial killer who became responsible for many other deaths. Kim cannot bring this case to court since the statute of limitations has ended.
With the help of his new partner, Jo, Kim start investigating a second victim, Hwang, whom Kang claims he killed by pushing down a flight of stairs. Kim and Jo look into old files of unsolved cases and find one matching Hwang's murder. The case is brought to trial but since there is only circumstantial evidence, Kang is not convicted of the murder. As a result, Kim is demoted and Jo is transferred to the narcotics division.
While clearing his desk, Kim notices an IUD birth control implant in the crime scene photo of the unidentified remains. He then gets a list of all the women who had IUD implants around the time of the murder and discovers one reported missing woman, Park Mi Yong. Kim quickly learns that Park was Kang's girlfriend at the time. She came to the city with her young son. As he grew older, Park realized that her constant fighting with Kang was not healthy for her son. She tries to break up with Kang and this is when he kills her. Kim tracks down Park's son, who is a teenager now, and has him testify in court against Kang. Kang is finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
Production.
After watching the episode of "Unanswered", Kim Tae-kyun began to work on his script and finished it after five years. During that time, he frequently interviewed the detective who worked on the case for his script material. Principal photography began on August 14, 2017 in Busan, and finished November 6, 2017.
Release.
The film was released in South Korea on October 3, 2018, alongside Hollywood films "Venom", "Christopher Robin" and "Sherlock Gnomes". On November 5, 2018, it was released in VOD services.
On August 20, 2018, the film received a R-rating from the Korea Media Rating Board, where the film is intended for audiences aged 19 and over. Replying to media, the film's production company stated that the film did not contained 'such strong' restricted content (such as violence and gore), and they believed that it is milder than two other 2018 released films "Believer" and "", which both received age 15 rating. As such, the film was re-edited and re-submitted to the board for an "age 15 rating", with no change in its release schedule. The film eventually was released under a "age 15 rating", after approximately 2 minutes' worth of content were shaved off from the original cut.
The film was selected as the opening film of the 3rd London East Asia Film Festival, held from October 25 to November 4, 2018.
Reception.
Critical response.
The film received positive reviews. Praise was given to Kim's directing, the acting performances, and the intriguing plot.
Yoon Min-sik from "The Korea Herald" praised the film and wrote, "It is a rare film with strong directing and acting that tells a compelling story with heart, mixed with suspense. The mystery tantalizingly teases viewers as they are sucked into the plot. Ju's portrayal of a psychopathic killer was surprisingly convincing and on-point. While his co-star Kim is as brilliant as expected."
Park Bo-ram from Yonhap News Agency also gave praise to the film, "The fierce interplay between the two main characters, portrayed by two rounded actors arguably both in the prime of their acting careers, forms the film's core, setting it apart from other crime films that play with cathartic action scenes or steel-strong images of police detectives."
Box office.
The film finished in second place during its opening day, grossing from 438,941 attendance, tailing "Venom" in the lead. It is second-biggest opening day for South Korean film this year after "". On October 6, four days after its release, the film surpassed 1 million admissions. During its opening weekend, the film earned gross from 995,752 attendance and finished in second place, tailing "Venom" in the chart lead.
On October 9, the film surpassed its break-even point at 2 million admissions. During its second weekend, the film rose to top the box office with gross from 552,983 attendance, though having 44% lower gross than its debut weekend.
The film surpassed 3 million admissions on October 17, after topping the box office for seven consecutive days. During its third weekend, the film dropped to second place with gross from 311,620 attendance. The film grossed from 161,156 attendance during its fourth weekend and finished second.
As of November 7, 2018, the film earned gross from 3,783,099 total attendance.
Controversy.
On September 20, 2018, the sister of a victim filed an injunction to the Seoul Central District Court to ban the screening of the film, complaining that the production crew did not ask permission before making a movie based on the murder of her brother. The family were also upset that the film only changed the story's timeline to 2012 (the actual murder case happened in 2007), and that some elements in the film bear great similarity to the actual case, such the suspect's age and his murder method.
In response to the controversy, the production crew released an official apology statement to the family on September 21, 2018, indicating they had been inconsiderate to the family and they will correspond with the family immediately.
On September 27, 2018, the family member of another victim shared a post on his social media account and drew media's attention. The family member had appeared in the 869th episode of "" in 2012, where the program investigated the murder of his mother and other victims. He wrote the reasons why he appeared in that particular program, and also showed support for the release of "Dark Figure of Crime", reasoning that the film will bring attention to unreported crimes.
On September 28, 2018, the Seoul Central District Court held the first hearing between the production company and the victim's family to decide if the film will be banned from release. The court watched the film for about 50 minutes, focusing on the issues raised by the victims' families where they claimed the film had reenacted almost 99% of the actual crime methods, the locations, time, and the victims' wounds. The court announced their decision by October 1, 2018.
On October 1, 2018, the families of the victims withdrew their application for the screening ban, after receiving a sincere apology from the production company and also having considered the film's intention to increase the awareness of unreported crimes.

Perennial (terminology)

Perennial (terminology) defines a mindset of a group of people who share common interests. The term is often used as a form of categorization based on psychographics and like-mindedness over demographic categorizations such as location, age, economic background, social background, or ethnic background. According to MSNBC, the term derived as a criticism against the term Millennials, which categorize groups of people according to birth dates.
Arts and culture.
According to "Billboard", “examples of Perennials in music, those whose music transcends age demographics, are plentiful [including] acts like Adele, Lorde, Rolling Stones, U2 and John Legend and, most notably, Lady Gaga’s collaboration with Tony Bennett.” American writer Dave Eggers described the term ‘’Perennial’’ in the San Francisco Chronicle as “a refreshing way to think about people who continue to inspire us over long periods of time. [The term has] a certain civic engagement that energizes other people, and the reinvention aspect is interesting. This tends to keep people relevant and tough to pinhole — people like Carrie Mae Weems, Yo-Yo Ma or Alice Waters.”

Plot.
Fearing a third world war situation, CIA agent "Mac" Mackenzie recruits Ahab, the captain of an elite mercenary company named Black Lizard to infiltrate a secret underground bunker located 30 meters below the Korean DMZ and take out a target. However, it is soon revealed the target is King, the Supreme Leader of North Korea. Along with his team, Ahab attacks the forces surrounding King and takes everyone hostage. However, as they're about to leave after killing the hostages, Ahab's man is attacked and despite Logan's requests to wait and request for a medevac, Ahab is ordered to move. Arriving at his room, Ahab finds himself taken hostage by a teammate who offers him a better deal after shooting both Logan and King. However, Ahab manages to acquire a gun and kills him, and then proceeds to the bathroom where he thinks King to be dead. He manages to set up the whole contact system there. Mac makes it clear that everyone dies if King does the same. However, Ahab is found to be crippled with an artificial right leg. Its being broken limits him from movement, and he orders his men to search for the doctor who came along with King. Using a motion camera, he manages to locate Dr. Yoon Ji-eui and his fellow members. His men save them from being attacked, while Yoon instructs Ahab to bring back King's heartbeat back. He tells him to transfer O+ blood into King's body, but finds the blood pouch useless. He then calls a wounded Logan to the bathroom and after injecting him, starts transferring blood from his body to that of the King despite of Logan's constant requests to not do so. Soon, the bunker is bombed, leaving Ahab and Yoon trapped, Logan dead and Ahab's army fighting the rivals.
Ahab and Yoon manage to contact each other and the latter helps him with extracting a bullet from his thigh. However, Ahab ends up tearing an artery, following which he tapes up his wound and instructs Yoon to find the blood pouches. In the meanwhile, Ahab finds network on his phone and receives a call from Mac. He asks for backup but is shocked to learn that she's been stripped off her charges and a second bombing has been ordered. He's told that while he and King would be rescued with President McGregor's support, his team and the North Korean doctor would be eliminated. Ahab leads Yoon to the room where he finds blood pouches but is stopped by an agent who's attacked by the former. With his team slowly dying, Ahab and Yoon remain the only survivors being hunted for. They manage to meet at the bathroom where Yoon transfers his own blood to King's body upon finding the blood pouches destroyed. Another gunfight ensues when the rivals enter the bathroom but are then shot by the backup team sent by Mac. President McGregor declares Ahab as a hero who fought to rescue King from the enemies, and eventually wins public support. Ahab, King and Yoon are rescued and taken in a plane which is soon attacked. An unconscious Yoon falls out of the plane and Ahab jumps with a parachute, first saving King and then Yoon by holding him tight as they swiftly reach the surface. Both Ahab and Yoon survive, and the latter gives him a shoulder as they begin walking.

Vaginitis emphysematosa

The term Vaginitis emphysematosa is related to Women's Reproductive Health and coined by Zweifel in 1877. The cases of Vaginitis emphysematosa are rare. The most important thing is that women never consult with the doctors for particularly Vaginitis emphysematosa but when they visit a doctor for some other reproductive health issue, they diagnose with the Vaginitis emphysematosa fortunately. Vaginitis emphysematosa is not common and Gynaecologists rarely know about it. Basically, this is characterised by gas-filled cysts in the mucosa of the vagina. Vaginitis emphysematosa is usually a self limited cystic disorder of the vagina. It is a very rare condition and has not much specific features to arouse clinical suspicion.
The term "Vaginitis emphysematosa" has 'vaginitis' in it but it has been observed that inflammation is generally mild and absent. This is characterised by gas-filled cysts in the vaginal wall and does not imply life-threatening infection.
Symptoms and signs.
Vaginitis emphysematosa occurs primarily in pregnant women, but there are some cases of non-pregnant women too. It is a rare, benign vaginal cyst identified in 173 cases. Women that have been affected were 42 to 65 years old. The cysts appear grouped but defined from one another, smooth, and can be as large as 2 cm. Symptoms included: vaginal discharge, itching, sensation of pressure, appearance of nodules, and sometimes a "popping sound".
Causes.
The cause is unknown. Histological examination showed the cysts contained pink hyaline-like material, foreign body-type giant cells in the cyst's wall, with chronic inflammatory cell fluid. The gas-filled cysts are identified with CT imaging. The gas contained in the cysts has been analysed and consists of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and sulphur dioxide. Treatment may not be required and no complications follow the resolution of the cysts. It may be associated with immunosuppression, trichomonas, or "Haemophilus vaginalis" infection. Vaginitis emphysematous is characterized by gas-filled cysts in the vaginal wall.

Parasite (2019 film)

Parasite () is a 2019 South Korean black comedy thriller film directed by Bong Joon-ho, who co-wrote the screenplay with Han Jin-won. The film, starring Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, Jang Hye-jin, and Lee Jung-eun, follows a poor family who scheme to become employed by a wealthy family and infiltrate their household by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.
"Parasite" premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival on 21 May 2019, where it became the first South Korean film to win the Palme d'Or. It was then released in South Korea by CJ Entertainment on 30 May 2019. The film was considered by many critics to be the best film of 2019 and one of the best films of the 21st century. It grossed over $258 million worldwide on a $15.5 million budget. Among its numerous accolades, "Parasite" won a leading four awards at the 92nd Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film, becoming the first non-English language film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. "Parasite" is the first South Korean film to receive Academy Award recognition and one of three films to win both the Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Picture. It won the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language, and became the first non-English language film to win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. A television series and two sequels are in early development.
Plot.
The Kim family—father Ki-taek, mother Chung-sook, daughter Ki-jung, and son Ki-woo—live in a small semi-basement apartment ("banjiha"), have low-paying temporary jobs folding pizza boxes, and struggle to make ends meet. University student Min-hyuk, a friend of Ki-woo's, gives the family a scholar's rock meant to promise wealth. Leaving to study abroad and knowing his friend needs the income, he suggests that Ki-woo pose as a university student to take over his job as an English tutor for the daughter of the wealthy Park family, Da-hye. Ki-woo, presenting himself as a Yonsei University student, is subsequently hired by the Parks.
The Kim family schemes to get each member of the family a job by posing as unrelated and highly qualified workers to become servants of the Parks. Ki-jung poses as "Jessica" and, using Ki-Woo as a reference, becomes an art therapist to the Parks' young son, Da-song. Ki-jung frames Yoon, Mr Park's chauffeur, for having sex in the car, then recommends Ki-taek to replace him. Finally, Chung-sook takes over as the Parks' housekeeper after the Kims exploit the peach allergy of the long-time housekeeper, Moon-gwang, to convince Mrs Park that she has tuberculosis. Ki-woo begins a secret romantic relationship with Da-hye.
When the Parks leave on a camping trip, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the residence before Moon-gwang abruptly appears at the door, telling Chung-sook she left something in the basement. She enters a hidden entrance to an underground bunker created by the architect and previous homeowner, where Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, has been secretly living for over four years, hiding from loan sharks. Chung-sook refuses Moon-gwang's pleas to help Geun-sae remain in the bunker, but the eavesdropping Kims accidentally reveal their true identities. Moon-gwang films them on her phone and threatens to expose their ruse to the Parks.
A severe rainstorm brings the Parks home early, and the Kims scramble to clean up the home and subdue Moon-gwang and Geun-sae before they return. The Kims trap Geun-sae and Moon-gwang in the bunker. Mrs Park reveals to Chung-sook that Da-song had a seizure-inducing traumatic experience on a previous birthday, when he saw a "ghost" — actually Geun-sae — emerging from the basement at night. Before the Kims manage to sneak out of the house, they hear Mr Park's off-handed comments about Ki-taek's smell. The Kims find their apartment flooded with sewer water and are forced to shelter in a gymnasium with other displaced people.
The next day, Mrs Park hosts a house party for Da-song's birthday with the Kim family's help. Ki-woo enters the bunker with the scholar's rock to find Geun-sae. Finding Moon-gwang has died from a concussion she received during the earlier fight, he is attacked by Geun-sae, who bludgeons his head with the rock and escapes, leaving Ki-woo lying in a pool of blood in the basement. Seeking to avenge Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified party guests. Da-song suffers another seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out until Chung-sook fatally impales Geun-sae with a barbecue skewer. While Ki-taek tends to a severely bleeding Ki-jung, Mr Park orders Ki-taek to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek, upon seeing Mr Park's disgusted reaction to Geun-sae's smell, angrily takes the knife and kills him. Ki-taek then flees the scene, leaving the rest of the Kim family behind.
Weeks later, Ki-woo is recovering from brain surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of fraud and put on probation. Ki-jung has died and Ki-taek, wanted by the police for Mr Park's murder, cannot be found. Geun-sae has been assumed to be an insane homeless man, and neither his nor Ki-taek's motive for the stabbings are known. Ki-woo spies on the Parks' home, now occupied by a German family unaware of its history, and sees a message in Morse code from a flickering light. Ki-taek, who escaped into the bunker via the garage, has buried Moon-gwang in the backyard and now raids the kitchen at night and sends the message every day, hoping Ki-woo will see it. Still living in their original basement apartment with his mother, Ki-woo writes a letter to Ki-taek, vowing to earn enough money to one day purchase the house and reunite with his father.
Production.
Development.
The idea for "Parasite" originated in 2013. While working on "Snowpiercer", Bong was encouraged by a theatre actor friend to write a play. He had been a tutor for the son of a wealthy family in Seoul in his early 20s, and considered turning his experience into a stage production. The film's title, "Parasite", was selected by Bong as it served a double meaning, which he had to convince the film's marketing group to use. Bong said "Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that "Parasite" refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor. So both are parasites."
Writing.
After completing "Snowpiercer", Bong wrote a fifteen-page film treatment for the first half of "Parasite", which his production assistant on "Snowpiercer", Han Jin-won, turned into three different drafts of the screenplay. After finishing "Okja", Bong returned to the project and finished the script; Han received credit as a co-writer.
Bong said the film was influenced by the 1960 Korean "domestic Gothic" film "The Housemaid" in which a middle-class family's stability is threatened by the arrival of a disruptive interloper in the form of household help. The incident of Christine and Léa Papin—two live-in maids who murdered their employers in 1930s France—also served as a source of inspiration to Bong. Bong also considered his own past, where he had tutored for a rich family. Bong said "I got this feeling that I was infiltrating the private lives of complete strangers. Every week I would go into their house, and I thought how fun it would be if I could get all my friends to infiltrate the house one by one." Additionally, the element of Moon-gwang having an allergy to peaches was inspired by one of Bong's university friends having this allergy, as Bong confirmed in a Reddit AMA.
Darcy Paquet, an American residing in South Korea, served as translator for the English subtitles and worked directly with Bong. Paquet rendered Jjapaguri or Chapaguri, a dish cooked by a character in the film, as "ram-don", meaning ramen-udon. It is a mix of Chapagetti and Neoguri produced by Nongshim. The English version of the film shows packages labelled in English "ramyeon" and "udon" to highlight to English speakers how the name was created. Paquet believed the word "ram-don" did not previously exist as he found no results on Google. On one occasion, Paquet used Oxford University as a reference instead of Seoul National University, and in another, used WhatsApp as the messaging application instead of KakaoTalk. Paquet chose Oxford over Harvard because of Bong's affinity for the United Kingdom, and because Paquet believed using Harvard would be "too obvious a choice". Paquet wrote, "[I]n order for humor to work, people need to understand it immediately. With an unfamiliar word, the humor is lost".
Filming.
Principal photography for "Parasite" began on 18 May 2018, and ended 124 days later on 19 September 2018. Filming took place around Seoul and in Jeonju. The director of photography for the film is Hong Kyung-pyo.
The Parks' house.
The Parks' house was a specially constructed set. The ground floor and the garden were constructed on an empty outdoor lot, while the basement and first floor were constructed on set. "We built the main floor of the house in a backlot and for the second floor it was all green screen outside," explained editor Yang Jin-mo. "When we shot toward the outside from inside, everything beyond the garden was all VFX."
Bong, as part of the scripting, had also designed the basic layout of this home. "It's like its own universe inside this film. Each character and each team has spaces that they take over that they can infiltrate, and also secret spaces that they don't know." A fictional architect Namgoong Hyeonja had been introduced as the home's designer and the previous owner before the Parks, and production designer Lee Ha-jun considered the function and form of the house based on how Namgoong would have designed it. The Parks' house was designed and constructed to not only be a beautiful house, but also "a stage that served the precise needs of his camera, compositions, and characters, while embodying his film's rich themes."
Lee said, "Since Mr Park's house is built by an architect in the story, it wasn't easy finding the right approach to designing the house...I'm not an architect, and I think there's a difference in how an architect envisions a space and how a production designer does. We prioritize blocking and camera angles while architects build spaces for people to actually live in and thus design around people. So I think the approach is very different." For example, Ha-jun established that Namgoong would have used the first floor's living room to appreciate the garden, so it was built with a single wide window and only spartan seating options for this function. Some of the interior artwork in the house sets were by South Korea artist Seung-mo Park, including existing artwork of hers and some explicitly created for the film. Further, design of the home and of its interiors were aimed to make the set amenable for filming at the 2.35:1 aspect ratio, favouring wide and deeper rooms rather than height.
Lee said the sun was an important factor when building the outdoor set. "The sun's direction was a crucial point of consideration while we were searching for outdoor lots", explained Lee. "We had to remember the sun's position during our desired time frame and determine the positions and sizes of the windows accordingly. In terms of practical lighting, the DP [director of photography Hong Kyung-pyo] had specific requests regarding the color. He wanted sophisticated indirect lighting and the warmth from tungsten light sources. Before building the set, the DP and I visited the lot several times to check the sun's movement each time, and we decided on the set's location together".
The Kims' apartment.
The Kims' semi-basement apartment and its street were also built on set, partially out of necessity for filming the flooding scenes. Lee Ha-jun visited and photographed several abandoned villages and towns in South Korea scheduled to be torn down to help inform the set design. He also created stories for the Kims' neighbours and added details of those residents along the street to improve the authenticity of the street's appearance.
Editing.
According to editor Yang Jin-mo, Bong Joon-ho chose to shoot the film without traditional coverage. To give them more editing options with limited shots, they sometimes stitched together different takes of the same shot. Yang edited the film using Final Cut Pro 7, a program not updated since 2011.
The principal release and editing of the film was done for release in color. A black and white version of the film was produced prior to the world premiere in Cannes and debuted on 26 January 2020 at the International Film Festival Rotterdam and was re-screened from 29 to 31 January. It also received a limited release in some countries.
Music.
The score was written by South Korean composer Jung Jae-il, who also wrote the score for Bong Joon-ho's 2017 film "Okja". Jung's music for "Parasite" consists of "minimalist piano pieces, punctuated with light percussion", which sets the film's "tense atmosphere". Excerpts from Handel's opera "Rodelinda" and the 1964 Italian song "In ginocchio da te" by Gianni Morandi also appear.
The end credits song "" (; not to be confused with an unrelated song with same Korean title by Im Chang-jung) was written by Bong and is performed by Choi Woo-shik, who also played the main character Ki-woo. It is displayed in English as "Soju One Glass" in the international digital releases of the soundtrack. When the song made it to the December 2019 shortlist for the 92nd Academy Awards in the Best Original Song category, it was listed under a grammatically correct English title, "A Glass of Soju".
The English titles of the scores listed below are as displayed in the back cover of the album and in the international digital releases of the soundtrack; the romanisation of names and nouns used are slightly different from those seen in the official English subtitles as translated by Darcy Paquet.
The soundtrack was released by Sacred Bones Records on vinyl in January 2020 and was co-released by Waxwork Records on a different colour variant of vinyl.
Themes and interpretations.
The main themes of "Parasite" are class conflict, social inequality and wealth disparity. Film critics and Bong Joon-ho himself have considered the film as a reflection of late-stage capitalism, and some have associated it with the term "Hell Joseon" (Korean: 헬조선), a satirical phrase that describes how living in hell would be exactly like living in modern South Korea. This term came about due to high rates of youth unemployment, the intense demands of pursuing higher education, the crisis of home affordability, and the increasing socio-economic gap between the wealthy and poor. In "Coronavirus Capitalism Goes to the Cinema", Nulman writes that the etymology of the word 'parasite' originally refers to “person who eats at the table of another”, which is presented in one of the scenes of the film. Nulman also notes the connection between parasites and the Marx quote "The capitalist… is only capital personified. His soul is the soul of capital. But capital has one sole driving force, the drive to valorize itself, to create surplus-value, to make its constant part, the means of production, absorb the greatest possible amount of surplus labor. Capital is dead labor which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labor, and lives the more, the more labor it sucks." The film also analyses the use of connections and qualifications to get ahead, for rich and poor families alike. Some argue that the film's discussion of class relates to Pierre Bourdieu's concept of habitus.
Bong has referred to "Parasite" as an upstairs/downstairs or "stairway movie", in which staircases are used as a motif to represent the positions of the families in the homes of the Kims and the Parks, as well as the basement bunker. The semi-basement apartment that the Kims live in is common for poorer Seoul residents due to its lower rent, despite having issues such as mould and increased risk of disease. Monsoon floods such as the one depicted in the film commonly damage these types of residences the most. The film presents class in spatial terms that speak to hierarchy, according to Nulman. 
According to Bong, the ending implies that Ki-woo will not be able to earn the funds needed to buy the house, as the final shot shows Ki-woo still in the basement flat and recalls the first scene; he described this shot as a "surefire kill" (확인사살), referring to a coup de grace to ensure death. The ending song refers to Ki-woo working to make money to get the house. Choi Woo-shik estimated that it would take approximately 564 years for Ki-woo to earn enough money to purchase the house. Nevertheless, he was optimistic: "I'm pretty sure Ki-woo is one of those bright kids. He'll come up with some idea, and he would just go into the German family's house, and I think he will rescue his father." However, according to many interpretations, this dream subscribes to a bootstrapping mentality and is unlikely to be achieved; furthermore, "it does not address the fundamental problem at hand. Even in this fantasy scenario, Ki-taek would still be contained in the house by a legal system that would seek his prosecution and imprisonment. The forces that created and upheld the Kim family's separation would not be undone, merely adapted to."
Critics have also considered the themes of colonialism and imperialism. According to Ju-Hyun Park, the film plays out within "the capitalist economic order inaugurated and upheld in Korea by colonial occupation," and the use of English language in the film denotes prestige within that economic system. The Park family's son, Da-song, is obsessed with "Indians" and owns Native American-themed toys and inauthentic replicas. Eugene Nulman makes the link between the 'native' Park family and the invaders - the Kims who bring with them deadly parasites for which the natives have no immunity. Nulman points to the miasma theory of scent carrying disease where it was thought that the natives could catch disease just by smelling the noxious air carried by colonizing Spaniards. This connects to the film's theme around the class distinction of smell. Bong has noted that "the Native Americans have a very complicated and long, deep history. But in this family, that story is reduced to a young boy's hobby and decoration... That's what happens in our current time: The context and meaning behind these actual things only exists as a surface-level thing".
Some critics note the importance of working class solidarity as presented in the film. The problems the Kims find themselves in were a result of a lack of class solidarity with the other poor family, Geun-sae and Moon-gwang. At the climax of the film, Mr Kim becomes aware of his class identity when Mr Park is disgusted with Geun-sae's smell.

In its tenth week of release the film crossed the $20 million mark (rare for an international film), making $632,500 from 306 theatres. During the weekend of the Oscars, the film made $1.5 million from 1,060 theatres for a running total of $35.5 million. After Neon's doubling of theatre showings in the week following the Academy Awards, the film made $5.5 million in revenue from the US &amp; Canada, making it one of the biggest Best Picture bumps since "Slumdog Millionaire" in 2009 and the biggest in ten years.
In its native South Korea, "Parasite" grossed US$20.7 million on its opening weekend, and would close its box office run with US$72.2 million and more than 10 million admissions, roughly one-fifth of the country's population and ranking among the year's top five films. On 5 February, "Parasite" became the first Korean film in nearly 15 years that surpassed one million moviegoers in Japan. In the UK, it broke the record for the opening weekend of a non-English-language film, making £1.4 million ($1.8 million) including previews over its debut weekend, from 135 screens, and in Australia it took in over $1.9 million. In the weekend following its Oscars wins, the film made $12.8 million from 43 countries, bringing its international total to $161 million, and its global running gross over the $200 million mark.
Following its Academy Awards success, "Parasite" received significant rescreening, generating significant further revenue. The Associated Press reported the biggest "Oscar effect" since 2001 after "Gladiator" won the Oscar for Best Picture. "Parasite"s box office revenue increased by more than 230% compared to the prior week, grossing $2.15 million in a single day. It also ranked No. 1 in Japan, the first Korean film to do so in 15 years. The Motion Picture Distributors Association of Australia announced that $749K worth of cinema tickets were sold in a single weekend, with the film re-entering the top 10 at the local box office more than six months after it debuted in Australian cinemas. "Parasite" also surged back to fourth place in South Korea's box office by attracting more than 80,000 viewers.
Critical response.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, "Parasite" has an approval rating of 98% based on 458 reviews, with an average rating of 9.40/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "An urgent, brilliantly layered look at timely social themes, "Parasite" finds writer-director Bong Joon Ho in near-total command of his craft." On Metacritic, 52 compiled reviews from critics were identified as positive, giving the film a weighted average score of 96 out of 100, indicating "universal acclaim". On the same site, "Parasite" was rated as the best film of 2019 and was ranked 7th among the films with the highest scores of the decade. As of 9 April 2021, it is the 47th highest-rated film of all time on the website.
Writing for "The New York Times", A. O. Scott described the film as "wildly entertaining, the kind of smart, generous, aesthetically energized movie that obliterates the tired distinctions between art films and popcorn movies". Bilge Ebiri of "New York" magazine wrote that "Parasite" is "a work that is itself in a state of constant, agitated transformation—a nerve-racking masterpiece whose spell lingers long after its haunting final image". In his five-star review, Dave Calhoun of "Time Out" praised the social commentary in the film, calling the overall work "surprising and fully gripping from beginning to end, full of big bangs and small wonders". "Variety"s Jessica Kiang described the film as "a wild, wild ride", writing that "Bong is back and on brilliant form, but he is unmistakably, roaringly furious, and it registers because the target is so deserving, so enormous, so 2019: "Parasite" is a tick fat with the bitter blood of class rage". Joshua Rivera from "GQ" gave a glowing review and declared "Parasite" to possibly be one of the best films from 2019.
Michael Wood writing for the "London Review of Books" found its following a theme of class consciousness to be consistent with the director's previous "Snowpiercer" stating, "The theme of social ascent, or social difference as a landscape, could hardly be more obvious, but we are beginning to get the movie's idea: not to avoid stereotypes but to keep crashing into them". UK film website TheShiznit awarded an A, noting "it makes you wonder what the inflection point for such behaviour is in a culture where manners and servitude are drilled into those who can't afford not to have them". "The A.V. Club"s A. A. Dowd awarded the film an A− grade, praising the fun and surprising twists.
"Parasite" ranked first in a survey by IndieWire of over 300 critics, in the Best Film, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Foreign Film categories. It also appeared on over 240 critics' year-end top-ten lists, including 77 who ranked it first.
Accolades.
"Parasite" won the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It became the first South Korean film to do so, as well as the first film to win with a unanimous vote since "Blue Is the Warmest Colour" at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, the film was nominated for three awards, including Best Director and Best Screenplay, and won Best Foreign Language Film, becoming the first ever South Korean film to achieve that feat.
It became the second international film to ever be nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture since "Life Is Beautiful" (1997), and ultimately won the category, making it the first international film to win the prize. "Parasite" was also nominated for four awards at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards—Best Film, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Film Not in the English Language, being the first South Korean film to receive nominations other than for Best Film Not in the English Language, and went on to win Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Not in the English Language.
"Parasite" was submitted as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film for the 92nd Academy Awards, making the December shortlist. It went on to win four awards—Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film. "Parasite" became the first non-English language film in Academy Awards history to win Best Picture. "Parasite" also became the first South Korean film to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards and the second East Asian film to receive a nomination for Best Picture since "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" (2000), and Bong Joon-ho became the fourth Asian person to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, becoming the second to win following Ang Lee. It also received nominations for Best Film Editing and Best Production Design. The film is also the second film to win both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Palme d'Or at Cannes under the latter's name in sixty-five years since "Marty", being the third film to win both grand prizes after the former and "The Lost Weekend".
At the 56th Grand Bell Awards, Parasite earned a leading 11 nominations with 5 awards (the most for the show) to its name. It won for Best Film, Best Director (for Bong Joon-ho), Best Supporting Actress (for Lee Jung-eun), Best Screenplay (for Bong Joon Ho and Han Jin-Won), and Best Music (for Jung Jae-il).
During Bong Joon-ho's acceptance speech at the Oscars, he paused to thank Martin Scorsese, a co-nominated director, whom Bong recognised as having historical importance to the history of filmmaking which resulted in spontaneous applause from the audience in recognition of Scorsese during his speech. The following day Scorsese sent the director a personal congratulatory letter which Bong reported while on a speaking engagement at the Film at Lincoln Center where Bong stated that he could not share the full letter from Scorsese due to its personal nature. He did, however, share the conclusion of the letter by stating that Scorsese told him that "You've done well. Now rest. But don't rest for too long." Bong then added that Scorsese ended his letter by stating "how he and other directors were waiting for my (Bong's) next movie".
The Associated Press commented that although the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) had previously failed to adequately recognise women filmmakers in the Academy Award nominations, this time it acknowledged diversity. "The Wall Street Journal" also stated that the film seemed to promise a "more inclusive Oscars" demanded by those who have previously criticised AMPAS. The AP noted that the film's victory, because of its being an Oscar-winning foreign film in a regular Academy category, opens the door for Hollywood to undergo a radical change and a different kind of advancement, as a sceptic worried that if "Parasite won the Oscar for best international film, it probably wouldn't win any other major awards". "The academy gave best picture to the actual best picture", wrote Justin Chang of the "Los Angeles Times", who continued that the film awards body was "startled ... into recognizing that no country's cinema has a monopoly on greatness".
Legacy.
Spin-off television series.
A six-hour HBO limited series based on the film, with Bong and Adam McKay as executive producers, is in early development. Bong has stated that this will also be entitled "Parasite", and will explore stories "that happen in between the sequences in the film". In February 2020, Mark Ruffalo was rumoured to star whilst Tilda Swinton was confirmed as being cast in a lead role.
Plans for tourist set.
A South Korean local government (Goyang City) plans to restore the Goyang Aqua Special Shooting Studio set, where the film "Parasite" was produced, and use it as a "Parasite" movie experience tourism facility. In addition, Goyang City has announced that it will invest $150 million in the development of the Goyang Film Culture Complex by 2026 to accommodate film experience tourism facilities, additional indoor studios, outdoor set production facilities, inter-Korean video content centres, and image research and development companies. However, criticisms have been made about the commercialisation of areas known for poverty in South Korea as tourist destinations without concrete steps being taken to address the issues at hand.
City tourism and food.
The Seoul Tourism Organization (STO) has been criticised by South Korea's opposition party and residents of Seoul for introducing a tour route featuring filming locations and stories from the film. The Justice Party claims that it became famous due to the universal recognition of global inequality. However, it sees the development of a tourist attraction based on the film in Seoul as amounting to the further exploitation of poverty. Residents living in "Parasite"'s filming locations have reportedly complained of a sense of embarrassment and discomfort due to an increase in tourists visiting their neighbourhoods and taking photos of their surroundings, making them feel like "monkeys in a zoo". In response, the local government of Seoul has announced that government funding will prioritise the estimated 1,500 low-income families living in the semi-basement type accommodations featured in the film.
People began posting videos on how to make jjapaguri (called "ram-don" in the film's English subtitles) on YouTube after the film was distributed. Nongshim, the manufacturer of Chapagetti and Neoguri, also began distributing a singular "Chapaguri" product due to the combination's popularity from the film.

Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane

Refilwe Maria Tsipane (born 3 September 1973), known as Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane (alternatively spelt Mtshweni), is a South African politician and a party member of the African National Congress (ANC), who has been serving as the 5th Premier of Mpumalanga since 20 March 2018. She succeeded former Premier David Mabuza after he was appointed Deputy President of South Africa. Mtsweni-Tsipane is also a Member of the Mpumalanga Provincial Legislature and previously served as the MEC for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs.
Family and personal life.
Mtsweni-Tsipane is married to Lawrence Tsipane and has two children. She spent most of her childhood in Lynnville, Emalahleni, where she went to primary school. She completed her secondary education in Atteridgeville in Pretoria. She obtained a Human Resources Diploma from the Tshwane University of Technology and a Certificate of Leadership and Governance from the University of the Witwatersrand.
In late-September 2020, Mtsweni-Tsipane announced that she had tested positive for COVID-19.
Political career.
Mtsweni-Tsipane was elected to the Mpumalanga Provincial Legislature in 2014 and was sworn in as a Member on 21 May 2014. Premier David Mabuza announced his new Executive Council in late-May and Mtsweni-Tsipane was selected to be the MEC for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs. The Democratic Alliance Provincial Leader, Anthony Benadie, said in a statement that Mtsweni-Tsipane "lacks the skill or strength of character to manage a complex portfolio".
In July 2017, when Mtsweni-Tsipane served as acting premier, she declared a special provincial funeral for Ray Phiri.
On 27 February 2018, she was sworn in as acting premier by Judge President Malesela Legodi, replacing Mabuza, who was appointed Deputy President of South Africa. The Provincial Democratic Alliance Leader Jane Sithole said that the swearing-in of Mtsweni-Tsipane was "unconstitutional" because former Mabuza was not in the position to appoint an acting premier to a position that he no longer holds.
She was sworn in for a second time as acting premier on 1 March 2018 in Pretoria. On 14 March 2018, the ANC NEC officially nominated Mtsweni-Tsipane to become the Premier of Mpumalanga. She served as Premier-elect until the legislature confirmed her to the position on 20 March. She was formally inaugurated on that same day by Legodi. She is the first woman to hold the role.
Following the May 2019 elections, the African National Congress announced that it had retained Mtsweni-Tsipane as Premier of Mpumalanga. She took office for her first full term on 27 May 2019.
In January 2021, Mtsweni-Tsipane attracted criticism after she arrived at Jackson Mthembu's funeral without wearing a mask, despite COVID-19 regulations stipulating that a mask must be worn in public. The premier's office stated that her mask was broken and that she was oblivious that it had fallen off. Mtsweni-Tsipane also apologised for the incident, however, the national minister of police, Bheki Cele, called for an investigation into her actions. She later signed admission of guilt and apologised for not wearing a mask. The incident also resulted in a R1,500 fine for Mtsweni-Tsipane, and Cele confirmed that she now has a criminal record.
On 16 February 2021, she withdrew her candidacy for ANC provincial chairperson.

St Dyfrig's Church, Treforest

St Dyfrig's Church is a listed Roman Catholic church in the village of Treforest near Pontypridd, South Wales. The church was founded in the 19th century, though the present structure dates from the 1920s.
Original church.
A Catholic presence began in Treforest soon after the Great Famine in Ireland (1840s), when many Irish immigrants arrived in South Wales. At the time, there was no place of worship in Treforest, and spiritual needs were catered for by clergy travelling in from Merthyr Tydfil and Aberdare. A school was founded in , though Aberdare continued issuing baptismal certificates for the district until 1868. The first St Dyfrig's (the saint was first referred to by his Latin name of Dubricius) was opened on Bridge Street in 1868. At first, the school was annexed to it, but in 1884 it moved to a new location, where it remained into the early 1960s.
Current church.
Soon after the First World War, the original church was becoming too small for its congregation. In 1914, Senghennydd was partitioned from Treforest, with the congregants from the area transferring to the new All Souls Church in Senghenydd, though overcrowding remained a problem at St Dubricius', with worshippers sometimes obliged to sit outside the door. Work began on the replacement church on Broadway in 1926, and it was consecrated on 24 November 1927 by Archbishop Francis Mostyn. In the 1930s, the dedication was amended from Dubricius to Dyfrig. There was a reordering in the 1950s, when a new altar was installed. A life-sized crucifix and side-panels were added in 1999 by Penanne Crabbe. The church gained Listed status in 2001. The church is open during the week, and as the only Catholic church within easy distance of the University of South Wales' Treforest campus, it is often attended by students during term time.

Alpha-Galactosylceramide

"alpha"-Galactosylceramide (α-GalCer, KRN7000) is a synthetic glycolipid derived from structure-activity relationship studies of galactosylceramides isolated from the marine sponge "Agelas mauritianus". α-GalCer is a strong immunostimulant and shows potent anti-tumour activity in many "in vivo" models.
Immunostimulatory properties.
α-GalCer is a potent activator of iNKT cells, and a model CD1d antigen. The invariant T cell receptor of the iNKT cell is able to bind the CD1d:glycolipid complex leading to iNKT cell activation in both mice and humans.
Adjuvant activity.
In combination with a peptide antigen, α-GalCer is able to stimulate a strong immune response against the epitope. The CD1d:glycolipid:TCR interaction activates the iNKT cell which can then activate the dendritic cell. This causes the release of a range of cytokines and licenses the dendritic cell to activate a peptide-specific T cell response. This adjuvant acts through this cellular interaction, rather than through classic pattern recognition receptor pathways.

Chortis Block

The Chortis Block is a -wide continental fragment in Central America (Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, and the off-shore Nicaragua Rise) located in the northwest corner of the oceanic Caribbean Plate.
Extent.
The northern margin of the Chortis Block is the Motagua-Polochic fault of the North American-Caribbean strike-slip boundary. The Cocos/Farallon Plate subducts beneath its western margin resulting in the Middle America Trench and the Central America Volcanic Arc. Miocene-Holocene-aged rifts in the northern and western Chortis Block is the result of slow internal deformation. The southern and eastern extent is roughly the Nicaragua-Costa Rica border and the offshore Hess Escarpment.
The Chortis Block can be subdivided into several terranes, the names and extents of which varies considerably between different authors.
Tectonic history.
Gondwanan origin.
During the Late Neoproterozoic-Early Palaeozoic the Chortis Block was probably located on the northern shores of what is now Colombia, then the northern margin of the Amazonian Craton, with an ocean separating it and the other blocks from core North America or Laurentia. Before the Early Carboniferous formation of Pangaea the Chortis Block thus formed part of the northern margin of Gondwana, located south of other Peri-Gondwanan terranes such as Oaxaca, Carolina, Yucatán, and Florida. These blocks either escaped the Laurussia-Gondwana collision and were broken off Gondwana later, or were accreted to Laurentia during the collision.
Laurentian origin.
Located in a largely unpopulated, mountainous region, the geology of which is poorly known, the Chortis Block is the only Precambrian-Palaeozoic continental crust on the Caribbean Plate and even its origin within North America has remained enigmatic and disputed for decades.
Three models have been proposed for the origin of the Chortis Block:

Rector v. Major League Baseball Advanced Media

Rector v. Major League Baseball Advanced Media, No. 303630 (N.Y. Sup. Bronx Co. 2014), was a New York Supreme Court defamation case. Andrew Rector sued Major League Baseball, the New York Yankees, ESPN and their MLB announcers for broadcasting images of him sleeping at a game at Yankee Stadium between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox and allegedly making defamatory comments about him. Rector sued for $10 million for "defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress". The case was dismissed by Judge Julia Rodriguez, who ruled that the statements made were not defamatory.
Background.
On April 13, 2014, Rector attended Yankee Stadium to watch the New York Yankees play the Boston Red Sox in a Yankees–Red Sox rivalry game. During the fourth inning, Rector was filmed by ESPN sleeping in his seat with the footage broadcast to viewers during their live coverage of the game. ESPN New York announcers Dan Shulman and John Kruk made a number of jokes about him when his image was placed on the stadium jumbotron. They initially commented that Rector was oblivious to the quality of MLB.tv that they had been promoting in commentary prior to Rector's image being broadcast and then made comments about Rector, questioning how he could sleep through a Carlos Beltran home run and stated that the person who sat next to him did not want to share his food with Rector. They also compared Rector's body size to Kruk's. MLB later posted the broadcast video of Rector sleeping online where it was covered by a number of media organizations worldwide. Rector filed a defamation lawsuit at the New York Supreme Court in The Bronx, New York against MLB, ESPN, the Yankees and the ESPN announcers for $10 million alleging that they subjected him to "an unending verbal crusade". Legal experts speculated that the challenge would not be successful owing to the statements causing emotional stress rather than damaging reputation and due to defamation cases historically being unsuccessful under New York State law.
Case.
Rector alleged in his claim, which was reportedly full of typographical and grammatical errors, that the announcers had called him "a fatty cow", then used words such as "stupor", "unintelligent" and "stupid", and said that he was "not worthy to be a fan." He also alleged that MLB.com had posted numerous memes, including one of him involved in a homosexual kiss and one with the caption of "Yankee's Fan cares not for your rivalry talk", that implied that he supported what was occurring in the images. He claimed that the MLB's posting of the video online "set the stage" for further defamatory comments from online viewers. The MLB's legal team filed a motion to dismiss on procedural grounds, as Rector had not stated a cause of action, and the statements in question had been loose and hyperbolic and not malicious defamation. The MLB, ESPN and the New York Yankees submitted CD copies of both the incident and the entire broadcast, which they stated showed that the statements alleged by the plaintiff were not made.
In court, Judge Julia Rodriguez granted the defendants' motions. In her judgement, she stated that the CDs of the broadcasts showed that the announcers did not make the statements alleged in the complaint and that they had been made by other individuals on websites not run by the defendants. While she agreed that comments had been made about Rector's weight and his ability to sleep through a standing ovation, he was only shown and commented on for 31 seconds; the judge ruled the comments made did not meet the legal standard of defamation. She also stated that ESPN had not broadcast Rector unauthorized, as it was common practice for broadcasters at baseball games to show spectators. Judge Rodriguez stated that with regard to Rector's claim of "emotional distress", none of the alleged comments were attributable to the defendants and they could not be held responsible for alleged defamatory comments made by third parties on third-party websites, as there was no duty of care to protect him from those statements. As a result, the case was dismissed.
Aftermath.
Following Rector's filing of the case being made public, news organisations criticized the action as frivolous litigation. Legal commentators stated that due to the media attention that the case brought, Rector probably ended up causing more damage to his reputation by bringing the case than the initial broadcast would have. Rector's lawyer, Valentine Okwara had stated that he had advised his client that "there is room for appeal". The lawsuit has since been used as a case study on the issue of defamation at sports events.

Zhusheng Temple (Hunan)

Zhusheng Temple () is a Buddhist temple located at the foot of Mount Heng, in Nanyue District of Hengyang, Hunan, China. It was inscribed to the National Key Buddhist Temples in Han Chinese Area's list in 1983.
History.
Zhusheng Temple was first construction as "Mituotai" () during the Tang dynasty (618-907) by master Chengyuan (), the Third Patriarch of Pure Land Buddhism. In 779, Emperor Daizong of Tang inscribed and honored the name "Bozhou Daochang" (). During the Zhenyuan period of Emperor Dezong of Tang (785-805), the Tang emperor named the temple "Mituo Temple" (). Since Emperor Wuzong (814-846) of the Tang dynasty (618-907) believed in Taoism, he ordered to demolish Buddhist temples, confiscate temple lands and force monks to return to secular life. This was known as "Huichang Suppression of Buddhism" (). The temple was completely destroyed in the movement.
During the period of Five Dynasties and Ten Reigns (930-960), King Wumu of Chu Ma Yin rebuilt the temple and named it "Baoguo Temple" ().
During the Taiping Xingguo period (968-976) of Song dynasty (960-1279), Emperor Taizong of Song renamed it "Shengye Temple" (). In 1119, Emperor Huizong of Song believed in Taoism, he ordered to change the Buddhist temple to Taoist temple and named it "Shenxiao Palace" ().
During the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368), Shengye Temple was enlarged burned, and rededicated several times.
In 1635, during the late Ming dynasty (1368-1644), abbot Foding () renovated the temple. 
In 1705, in the 44th year of Kangxi period of Qing dynasty (1644-1911), Kangxi Emperor made an inspection trip in the south, Zhao Shenqiao (), provincial governor of Hunan, changed the temple to a Royal palace, but Kangxi Emperor didn't come here. In 1713, Kangxi Emperor gave the temple a set of "Dragon-store" (). In 1727, in the 5th year of Yongzheng period, Yongzheng Emperor renamed the temple "Zhusheng Temple" (), and has continued to this day.
During the early Republic period (1911-1949), master Kongye () established a Tiantai school here. In 1929, master Lingtao () founded the Buddhist Institute of Mount Heng here. On May 7, 1937, Ye Jianying organised the Rescue Association of Mount Heng Buddhism and Taoism () here.
After the establishment of the Communist State in 1956, the Buddhist Association of Mount Heng was set up here. During the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards had attacked the temple, scriptures, historical documents, and other works of art were either removed, damaged or destroyed, many original Buddha statues and musical instruments of the temple had been lost, but the buildings and halls still intact. In 1979, according to the national policy of free religious belief, Zhusheng Temple was reconstructed and reopened. It has been designated as a National Key Buddhist Temple in Han Chinese Area in 1983.
Architecture.
Along the central axis of the temple stand five buildings including shanmen, Hall of Four Heavenly Kings, Mahavira Hall, Dharma Hall and Abbot's Room.
Mahavira Hall.
The Mahavira Hall is the third hall in the temple. In the center of the temple enshrines the statue of Sakyamuni with Amitabha standing on the left and Bhaisajyaguru on the right.

2017–2018 South African listeriosis outbreak

The 2017–2018 South African listeriosis outbreak was a widespread outbreak of "Listeria monocytogenes" food poisoning that resulted from contaminated processed meats produced by Enterprise Foods, a subsidiary of Tiger Brands, in Polokwane. There were 1,060 confirmed cases of listeriosis during the outbreak, and about 216 deaths. It is the world's worst ever listeriosis outbreak.
Investigation of the origin.
Prior to 2017, an average of 60 to 80 listeriosis cases were confirmed in South Africa per year. The outbreak was first identified by doctors at Chris Hani and Steve Biko academic hospitals in July 2017, who notified the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) about an unusually high number of neonatal infections.
Interviews conducted by the authorities with people who contracted listeriosis indicated that processed cold meats, most notably polony, was the likely cause of the outbreak. The source of the outbreak at the Enterprise Foods facility was only discovered after nine five-year-old children from Soweto were brought to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in mid-January 2018. Samples taken from Enterprise and Rainbow Chicken polony products at the crèche the children attended tested positive for the strain of listeriosis causing the outbreak and led investigators to the infected production facilities.
On March 4, 2018, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi announced that the disease was traced to the Enterprise processed meats factory in Polokwane. Environmental samples from the factory were found to contain the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes strain ST 6, the strain responsible for the outbreak. Additionally, further samples from another Enterprise factory in Germiston and from a Rainbow Chicken factory in the Free State tested positive for Listeria, although which strain these samples tested positive for is not yet known.
Impact.
Laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases started to rise in mid-2017 and peaked in December 2017, with 32 cases in a week. Gauteng was the province with the most cases, 58%, followed by Western Cape with about 13%. A report from the National Department of Health in July 2018 stated there had been 1,060 laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis, and 216 deaths.
Reactions after cause was known.
Following the announcement, Tiger Brand's stock price on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange dropped by 7%, resulting in a R5.7bn (equivalent to US$438.69 million) reduction in total value. At a press conference the next day, Tiger Brands CEO Lawrence MacDougall denied responsibility, stating "There is no direct link between any of the deaths and our products." When pressed by journalists, he refused to apologize.
The South African government issued a recall notice of all products of RCL Foods Limited and Enterprise Foods and Rainbow Chicken facilities on March 4. Tiger Brands reportedly admitted to knowing about the presence of listeria in some of its products eighteen days before the government recall.
On March 5, Botswana, Namibia, Mauritius, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia suspended all imports of processed meat from South Africa. Kenya followed suit on the next day.
In December 2018 the South Gauteng High Court granted a certification order opening up the process for class-action lawsuit against Tiger Brands for around 1,000 claimants. Each claimant might be eligible to seek between R100,000 and R2,000,000 in compensation for their losses due to the outbreak.

Resonate (festival)

Resonate is an annual festival for art and digital culture in Belgrade, Serbia, usually held over five days at the end of April. The first edition was held in 2012. It is the biggest media art festival in Serbia.
The festival is part of a collaborative project We Are Europe (funded by the EU) together with festivals in other countries such as Sónar (Barcelona), c/o pop (Cologne), TodaysArt, Elevate, Insomnia, Nuits Sonores, and Reworks. Resonate co-curates at some of these festivals too with independent programs and vice versa c/o pop, TodaysArt, Elevate and Sónar co-curated wing programs at Resonate. The festival has several activities during daytime and in the evening: a conference, varying exhibition formats, a film and video program, performances, and workshops.
Non-payment scandal
In the run-up to the 2018 edition of the festival, it emerged that many artists both local and international had not been paid, some for years. A group of local artists even set up the Facebook group Still Unpaid At Resonate Festival, where it then emerged that the travel agent was also owed more than €28,000 for flights. As a result, some artists began pulling out in solidarity, leading to cancelled shows.
Despite this, the organisers advertised a further iteration in 2019 but owing to the brewing scandal the event was cancelled. As of September 2020, the festival's website is no longer active and the URL is available for sale.

Greek Communist Youth – Rigas Feraios

The Greek Communist Youth «Rigas Feraios» (, abbreviated EKON Rigas Feraios, "ΕΚΟΝ Ρήγας Φεραίος") was a communist youth organization in Greece. The organization was baptized after Rigas Feraios, a national hero from the Greek War of Independence. EKON Rigas Feraios was the youth wing of the Communist Party of Greece (Interior) and formed the backbone of the party. Rather than being merely a front of the mother party, the Rigas Feraios youth organization exercised significant influence over the party. At its peak, EKON Rigas Feraios had some 15,000-17,000 members.
The Rigas Feraios youth organization was established in 1967, shortly after the beginning of the Regime of the Colonels. It was the first illegal youth organization to emerge after the coup. The organization succeeded the now defunct Lambrakis Democratic Youth (DNL), the founders of Rigas Feraios had belonged to DNL. Rigas Feraios members were active in organizing resistance to the new regime, distributing leaflets and painting anti-junta graffiti around the country. By September 18, 1968 many Rigas Feraios organizers had been arrested by the junta. On October 29, 1968 the Rigas Feraios leadership was put on trial. The defendants were sentenced to jail, with sentences ranging from 5 to 21 years. A failed attempt to initiate low-scale armed struggle was launced in , with the formation of the 'Aris-Rigas Feraios' armed group.
The Rigas Feraios organization aligned with the New Left, although influenced by Eurocommunism. As the Communist Party of Greece split in 1968, Rigas Feraios became increasingly tied to the Communist Party of Greece (Interior). Rigas Feraios, which took a critical stance of the Soviet Union, would now compete with the pro-Soviet Communist Youth of Greece (KNE) over the influence of the leftwing youth movement in the country. By 1972 Rigas Feraios was the largest youth organization, although KNE eventually outgrew it. EKON Rigas Feraios had a key role in organizing the November 1973 Athens Polytechnic uprising against the military junta. The student wing of EKON Rigas Feraios was known as 'Democratic Struggle-Democratic Unity' (DA-DE). In 1974 DA-DE won 14.6% of the national student vote, in 1975 16.42%, in 1976 17.52%, in 1977 20.94% and in 1978 in 16.7%.
During the 1970s EKON Rigas Feraios underwent period of internal strife, which ended up in a formal split in 1978 as the minority wing formed the B Panelladiki. The influence of EKON Rigas Feraois declined towards the end of the 1970s. In 1979, DA-DE won 7.5% of the national student vote. In 1980 it obtained 8.9% and in 1981 10.1%.

1998–99 FC Basel season

The 1998–99 Fussball Club Basel 1893 season was their 106th season since the club's foundation. Following their promotion in the 1993–94 season this was their fifth consecutive season in the highest tier of Swiss football.
René C. Jäggi was the club's chairman for the third year. FC Basel played their home games in the St. Jakob Stadium until 13 Dezember 1998. From 7 March 199 they played their games in the Stadion Schützenmatte while the new stadium was being built.
Overview.
Pre-season.
Guy Mathez, who had taken over the coaching in January of that year, was appointed as the new trainer at the start of the season, but on 14 May 1999 he was sacked and was replaced by Marco Schällibaum (ad interim) until the end of the season.
The club made many new signings as the season started, these included Mario Cantaluppi who returned from Servette. Also from Servette came the Romanian international Dan Potocianu and, on loan, the youngster Carlos Varela. Aleksandr Rytchkov was signed from 1. FC Köln and Philippe Cravero signed in from lower classed Etoile Carouge. The Ivorian international Ahmed Ouattara and the young Brazilian Abedi were signed in from Sion. Benjamin Huggel was signed in from local amateur club FC Münchenstein, he had played the previous season for FC Arlesheim, in the fourth tier of Swiss football.
In the other direction Adrian Knup, Daniel Salvi and Jürgen Hartmann all ended their football careers. Dario Zuffi returned to his club of origin Winterthur after having playing five years for the club. Jan Berger moved to Aarau and youngster Alexander Frei was loaned out to Thun so that he could obtain more playing time. Fabinho Santos returned home to Joinville in Brasil.
The first half of the season, until 13 December 1998, Basel's home ground was the St. Jakob Stadium. From 7 March 199 they played their games in the Stadion Schützenmatte and this because the old stadium was demolished and the new stadium was to be built on the same ground. The construction of the new stadium was to be in a little more than two years. The new stadium, the St. Jakob-Park, was to be an all seater, the old stadium had standing places on three sides.
The Campaign.
Domestic League.
The club's priority aim was to remain in the top flight of Swiss football. The season started fairly well, with five victories and three draws in the first ten rounds. However, seven defeats in the next nine rounds let the team slip down into the bottom areas of the table. Basel ende the qualification stage with eight victories, four draws and ten defeats, with just 21 goals scored and 34 conceded, with 28 points in sixth position in the league table. With this tally they were qualified for Champions Group for the second half of the season. With an average second half of the season, winning five games, drawing four and losing five, Basel in the league tables fifth position, managed to qualify for the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup. With four goals in the qualification round and six in the championship round Mario Frick was the teams top goal scorer.&lt;ref name="rsssf-Nationalliga A 1998/99"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Swiss Cup.
All eyes were set on the cup season. But despite a draw against lower classed Stade Nyonnais, Basel's cup season came to an abrupt end, because they were unable to pass this hurdle, losing the match on penalties. Lausanne-Sport won the Swiss Cup final on 13 June 199 in the Wankdorf Stadium, winning 2–0 against Grasshopper Club.&lt;ref name="rsssf-Switzerland 1998/99"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Loudetia simplex

Loudetia simplex is a grass species found in tropical and Southern Africa and Madagascar. It was originally described as a "Tristachya" species by Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck in 1841 and was transferred to "Loudetia" by Charles Edward Hubbard in 1934.
The species is a perennial bunch grass, with culms erect and long. Leaves are mostly basal, with flat, convolute blades long and 2–5 mm wide. The inflorescence is a long panicle of spikelets, each containing one sterile and one fertile flower. The lemma carries a 25–50 mm long awn.
Like all "Loudetia" species, "L. simplex" uses C4 photosynthesis and occurs in open habitats, often on poor shallow soils. It is a significant weed species.
Two subspecies have been described:
In Madagascar, it is one of the dominant grassland species in the central high plateaus, where it occurs on leached, poorly drained soils and is quite fire-resistant. In Malagasy, it is known locally as "horona", "horo", "berambo", "kilailay", "kirodrotra", or "felika". It has only medium value as pasture grass.

Sultan Ibragimov vs. Evander Holyfield

Sultan Ibragimov vs. Evander Holyfield, was a professional boxing match contested on 13 October 2007 for the WBO heavyweight championship.
Background.
Shortly after Ibragimov's decision victory over Shannon Briggs to win the WBO belt in June 2007, Ibragimov signed the contract to face then-WBA world heavyweight champion Ruslan Chagaev in a unification showdown that would take place in Moscow on 13 October 2007. "I gotta be honest – I've never had easier negotiations in my career. Right after beating Briggs, Ibragimov told me that he wanted to face a world champion in his next fight, in the end we contacted members of Ruslan Chagaev's team and agreed on everything", said the president of Seminole Warriors Boxing promotion company Leon Margules during the first pre-fight press-conference, "Both Sultan and Ruslan are true fighters. They are not interested in easy fights and title defenses against mandatory challengers. They want to unify belts and once again return prestige to the heavyweight division. I'm confident that the winner of this fight will eventually become the undisputed heavyweight champion". It was going to be the first heavyweight unification fight since 1999 and the third boxing event considered major for Moscow since WBC world heavyweight champion Oleg Maskaev defended his title against Okello Peter and heavyweight contender Alexander Povetkin faced fringe contender Larry Donald. 
On 31 July 2007, it was officially announced that the unification showdown was cancelled due to Chagaev suffering from an aggravation of gastric problems. It was later reported that Chagaev had been diagnosed with hepatitis B. Instead, former undisputed heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield agreed to step in as a last-minute replacement. In the build up, Ibragimov praised Holyfield for his legendary career: "I remember watching his legendary heavyweight fights of the 90s when I was young. Some of them were unforgettable, like those against Riddick Bowe. Of course [back then] I couldn't imagine that I would fight Holyfield one day." He also added: "In the training camp, we put a lot of emphasis on defense. Holyfield is a dirty fighter who uses his head and elbows a lot." For the fight, Holyfield weighed in at 211.5 pounds, his lightest since 1996.
The fight.
The beginning of the fight was tentative, with Ibragimov mostly staying on the outside and avoiding exchanges, keeping Holyfield at bay with fast combinations. By the third round, Ibragimov began to take control of the fight. In the fifth round, Ibragimov's in-ring dominance became more visible after he was able to hurt Holyfield with combinations to the head and body, and by the seventh the fight took on one-sided manner as Holyfield appeared to be unable to keep up with his younger foe. Holyfield had some success in the eighth, hurting Ibragimov with a counter body shot and a straight right hand. Ibragimov appeared to be unwilling to end the fight inside the distance in order not to walk into a game-changing counter punch. The championship rounds saw Holyfield unsuccessfully going for the knockout, as Ibragimov was able to effectively neutralize Holyfield's offense and hurt Holyfield with precise body shots. Ultimately, the fight went full twelve rounds, with Ibragimov being declared the winner by unanimous decision, successfully defending his WBO world heavyweight title. The judges scored the bout 117–111 (twice) and 118–110.
Aftermath.
Ibragimov would agree to face IBF champion Wladimir Klitschko in the first heavyweight unification bout since 1999, losing his title in a unanimous decision before retiring. Holyfield would spend more than a year out of ring before facing WBA champion Nikolai Valuev where he would be on the end of a controversial majority decision ending his hopes of beating George Foreman's record as the oldest heavyweight champion in history.

Frances Cecil, Countess of Exeter (died 1669)

Frances Cecil, Countess of Exeter (2 December 1630 – 2 December 1669), formerly Lady Frances Manners, was the first wife of John Cecil, 4th Earl of Exeter.
She was a daughter of John Manners, 8th Earl of Rutland, and his wife, the former Frances Montagu. The Countess of Exeter's sisters, Margaret, Elizabeth and Dorothy, all became countesses. Another, Anne, became a Viscountess.
She married the earl on 8 December 1646.
Two of their children survived infancy:
The countess's portrait in miniature was painted in about 1646 (the year of her marriage) by Samuel Cooper, and is held by Burghley House.
Some sources give the date of her death as 1660, but the parish register of St Martin's Church, Stamford, shows her to have been buried in December 1669. A few weeks after her death, the earl married Lady Mary Fane, daughter of Mildmay Fane, 2nd Earl of Westmorland.

Afterglow (band)

Afterglow was an American psychedelic rock band in the late 1960s.
The band emerged from the Medallions, formed in 1965 in Chico, California, by guitarist Tony Tecumseh (Anthony Vernon Tecumseh, October 27, 1940–January 29, 2012), drummer Larry Alexander and a bassist named Mike, later joined by vocalist Gene Resler. Tecumseh was a Modoc, born in Klamath Agency, Oregon. The group played at local events, before disbanding to attend college. In 1966, Tecumseh, Alexander and Resler reconvened and added bassist Ron George and keyboard player Roger Swanson. After a period of rehearsal they changed their name to Afterglow and began recording an album at Leo Kulka's Golden State Recorders studio in San Francisco. The band performed in Northern California but, because of members' studies, they were unable to complete the album until 1967. Most of the tracks were written by Tecumseh, with Resler taking the majority of lead vocals. The self-titled album was released in 1968 on the small New York-based MTA label, but was not successful at the time and the band split up shortly afterwards.
In later years, the album acquired a cult reputation, being described as "a classic example of California pop and psychedelic", and "like a sampler of American psychedelic styles", recalling the music of the Doors, Jefferson Airplane, the Byrds and others. In 1995, it was reissued by Sundazed Records, and members of the band reunited to perform, though without Tecumseh because of his poor health. Tecumseh came to be regarded as "a forerunner in Native American involvement in rock and roll music", and was awarded the Native American Music Association's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011. He died in 2012.

<doc id="56747071" url="?curid=56747071" title="Moritz von Bomhard">
Moritz von Bomhard

Moritz von Bomhard (9 June 1908 – 23 July 1996) was a German-born conductor, opera producer, composer, and pianist. Educated in Leipzig, he settled in the United States in 1935 and became an American citizen in 1942. Bomhard was the founder of Kentucky Opera which he managed and conducted from its inception in 1952 until his retirement in 1982.
Early life.
Bomhard was born in Munich, one of the three children of Johanna and Ernst von Bomhard, an industrial engineer. He was educated in law at the University of Leipzig but also received a diploma in music from the Leipzig Conservatory. There he met Leila Atkinson a Kentucky-born cellist who was to become his first wife. They settled in New York in 1935 where Bomhard studied conducting on a fellowship at the Juilliard School. In 1937 he took up a teaching position at Princeton University which included conducting both the university's orchestra and glee club. During his time at Princeton he composed three symphonies, a concerto for strings, and pieces of chamber, piano, and vocal music. He also supplemented his income by coaching singers and choral groups and teaching piano privately.
Bombard became an American citizen in 1942 and served in the US Army during World War II. Leila died in 1945 after suffering severe mental illness which had confined her to a hospital. After the war, Bomhard studied at Columbia Teachers College, receiving his master's degree in 1947. However, he did not take up a formal teaching career. Instead he formed a small professional opera troupe called Opera for College (later renamed New Lyric Stage). The troupe travelled around the Eastern United States performing at colleges that had no opera departments of their own. He also composed incidental music for Margo Jones's regional theatre productions and served as composer-arranger for the Philharmonic Piano Quartet.
Forging a career in opera.
In 1949, Fletcher Smith, who had studied with Bomhard at Juilliard and was then head of the Voice Department at the University of Louisville, invited him to produce an opera to be performed by the students there. Bombard chose "The Marriage of Figaro", and it proved to be a great success. Bomhard returned in 1950 and 1951 to produce Menotti's "The Old Maid and the Thief" and Puccini's "Gianni Schicchi". Their box-office success following on from that of "The Marriage of Figaro" led him to disband his New Lyric Stage troupe and settle in Louisville where he and a group of Louisville citizens founded the Kentucky Opera Association in 1952. Later called Kentucky Opera, it was the city's first professional opera company and the twelfth oldest regional opera company in the United States.
He soon formed a partnership with the Louisville Philharmonic Society orchestra for the fledgling company to produce and record five new operas in English commissioned by the orchestra. One of these was Peggy Glanville-Hicks's "The Transposed Heads" which premiered in April 1954 conducted by Bomhard. He wrote a German translation of the "Transposed Heads" libretto for a possible performance in Germany. She thought he looked like John Barrymore. They became lovers and travelled to Europe together in the summer of 1954. Glanville-Hicks broke off the affair the following summer. In her letter to him of 8 August 1955 she blamed the fact that she was more in love with him than he with her and his dalliance with the soprano who had created the role of Sita in "Transposed Heads".
Apart from 1960–61, when he took a leave of absence to work at the Hamburg State Opera, Bomhard managed Kentucky Opera continuously until his retirement in 1982. In the early years of the company when it had an annual budget of only $10,000 to produce three operas, Bomhard not only conducted the performances, but was also the stage director and "répétiteur" and designed and helped build the sets. He also travelled to New York to scout young singers who showed great promise but did not yet command high salaries. He brought the 26-year-old Tatiana Troyanos to Kentucky Opera to sing her first ever Carmen in 1964. In the 1960s and early 1970s Bomhard concurrently taught at the University of Louisville music school, produced an annual opera for Memphis Opera Theatre in Tennessee, and produced and hosted two cultural series for WAVE television and radio.
Later years.
In 1963 Bombard had married the mezzo-soprano Charme Riesley. She sang Cherubino in his 1949 production of "The Marriage of Figaro" at Louisville and performed with Kentucky Opera both before and after their marriage. She appeared in "Ariadne auf Naxos" in December 1981, Bombard's last production for the company, and in 1983 accompanied him to the opening of the Kentucky Center for the Arts, whose Moritz von Bomhard Theater was named in his honor. Charme died in 1984 at the age of 55 after a long illness. According to "The Encyclopedia of Louisville", her death was "a blow from which he never really recovered." In 1994, Bomhard left Louisville for Europe to be near his only remaining relatives, a niece and nephew. He settled in Salzburg, Austria in January 1995 and died there on 23 July 1996 at the age of 88. He is buried in the Von Bombard family tomb in Munich.

Sergei Tretyakov (scientist)

Sergei Anatolyevich Tretyakov (; born in 1956) is a Russian-Finnish scientist, focused in electromagnetic field theory, complex media electromagnetics and microwave engineering. He is currently a professor at Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering, Aalto University (former Helsinki University of Technology), Finland. His main research area in recent years is metamaterials and metasurfaces from fundamentals to applications. He was the president of the European Virtual Institute for Artificial Electromagnetic Materials and Metamaterials (”Metamorphose VI”) and general chair of the Metamaterials Congresses from 2007 to 2013. He is a fellow/member of many scientific associations such as IEEE, URSI, the Electromagnetics Academy, and OSA. He is also an Honorary Doctor of Francisk Skorina Gomel State University.
Education.
Sergei Tretyakov has received the Engineer's degree and the Candidate of Sciences (PhD) degree in radiophysics from the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute, 
USSR in 1980 and 1987, respectively. In 1994 he was granted a Docent Diploma by the Ministry of Education of Russian Federation and in the following year he received Doctor of Sciences degree from St. Petersburg State Technical University, Russia. 
Tretyakov obtained his Full Professor Diploma in 1997 granted by the Ministry of Education, Russia.
Career.
Professional career of Sergei Tretyakov started in 1980 at Radiophysics Department of Leningrad Polytechnic Institute, where he had been an engineer and junior researcher until 1986.
In 1986 he was promoted to the position of assistant professor and in 1989 to the position of associate professor.
In October 1988, Tretyakov had a 10-months-long research visit to Helsinki University of Technology (from 2010, Aalto University) according to the exchange program between 
the Ministries of Education in Finland and Soviet Union. 
During following 8 years, Tretyakov was affiliated with both Electromagnetics Laboratory of Helsinki University of Technology where he worked with Ismo Lindell and Ari Sihvola and 
St. Petersburg State Technical University where he worked with Constantin Simovski. 
Tretyakov visited CEA Cesta (French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission research centre), also affiliated with the Laboratory of Wave-Material Interactions in University of Bordeaux, for 6 months in 1994 as a visiting scientist. 
In 1996, he was promoted to full professor position in St. Petersburg State Technical University, where he also became a director of Complex Media Electromagnetics Laboratory.
From January 1999 until July 2000 Tretyakov was a visiting professor in Electromagnetics Laboratory of Helsinki University of Technology and in August 2000, he moved to the Helsinki University of Technology as a full professor of Radio Engineering.
Later on, as a visiting professor, he visited the Abbe Center of Photonics in Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany during June – July 2013, and the Department of Photonics Engineering in Technical University of Denmark during January - April 2013. He educated 13 doctors of science.
Research.
Tretyakov has authored or co-authored more than 280 papers in refereed journals, 5 books, and 17 book chapters. Tretyakov's research career started with his diploma thesis under supervision of Prof. V.A. Rozov. The thesis was devoted to the problem of diffraction at an edge of dense planar arrays of metal wires, what is now referred as metasurfaces or two-dimensional metamaterials. During the doctoral studies, Tretyakov worked on ferrite-based anisotropic layered structures under supervision of Prof. M.I. Kontorovich. The first research visit to Helsinki University of Technology profoundly influenced his research interest, shifting it towards a novel and very promising direction of complex electromagnetic materials (now called metamaterials). From this time forth Tretyakov actively works in this research direction with the main contributions listed below.
Electromagnetics of chiral and general bianisotropic media.
Tretyakov made important contributions to research of bianisotropic media. Together with co-authors, he developed the general theory of electromagnetic waves interactions with bianisotropic materials and layers. Moreover, Tretyakov proposed and experimentally characterized first non-reciprocal bianisotropic scatterers of two types: so-called Tellegen scatterer (named after Bernard D. H. Tellegen who suggested gyrator as a circuit element with equivalent electromagnetic response) and artificial "moving" scatterer (a composite based on such scatterers emulate response of a truly moving medium). In 1997, Tretyakov and his colleagues demonstrated that chiral effects (optical rotation and circular dichroism) can be achieved even with an infinitely thin composite layer without broken mirror symmetry. This effect was subsequently named as planar chirality and independently discovered by the team of Nikolay I. Zheludev in 2003.
Chiral nihility and negative refractive index.
Possibility of existence of a backward wave medium, where electromagnetic waves propagate with anti-parallel phase and group velocities, was suggested by several scientists throughout the twentieth century: Arthur Schuster, Horace Lamb, Leonid Mandelstam, Victor Veselago, and others. However, due to the absence of materials with such properties in nature, wide interest to the backward wave media was generated only in the early 2000s, when the team of David R. Smith experimentally demonstrated first negative-index metamaterial. In 2003, Tretyakov and colleagues suggested an alternative way to achieve backward waves by using bianisotropic chiral materials. In this case, it is not required to engineer negative permittivity and permeability, instead, one should just ensure proper chiral response of the material. In the extreme case of so-called chiral nihility (when both relative permittivity and permeability are much smaller than the chirality parameter), two eigenwaves represent "forward" and "backward" circularly polarized waves with equal phase velocities. The existence of backward waves in chiral media was independently suggested by John Pendry in 2004.
Broadband cloaking of cylindrical objects.
Inspired by the idea of transformation-optics based electromagnetic cloaking, Tretyakov's team developed an alternative realization of the same effect for cylindrical objects. In contrast to the previous designs, Tretyakov's cloaking device exhibits significantly increased bandwidth and lower amount of dissipation loss. Moreover, it does not require the use of exotic metamaterials with gradient permittivity and permeability, but, instead, is based on conducting plates with a simple geometry.
Strong spatial dispersion in wire media.
In 2003, Tretyakov's group demonstrated that a dense array of metal wires (wire medium), generally, exhibits strong nonlocal response (spatial dispersion), i.e. cannot be described by usual material parameters such as permittivity. The property of strong spatial dispersion enables the use of wire media for subwavelength imaging and transmission of images over long distances.
Superlensing.
The concept of the superlens, introduced by John Pendry in 2000 as an extension of the work done by Victor Veselago, showed a theoretical possibility to achieve optical resolution well below the wavelength. In 2003, Stanislav Maslovski and Sergei Tretyakov showed that an alternative to Pendry’s device can be constructed using layers that impose the necessary boundary conditions at two parallel planes in free space. Later in 2004, Tretyakov with co-authors explored the necessary electromagnetic properties of the layers and confirmed the effect with experiments.
Constitutive parameters of metamaterials.
By definition, metamaterials are realized as lattices whose periodicity is assumed to be much smaller than the wavelength. However, it is important that, though small, the periodicity is not negligible with respect to the wavelength. For this reason, if one formally introduces constitutive parameters for such regime, they will not be measurable response functions, and it will not be possible to use them for a sample of other dimensions or for a sample excited in another way. In other words, such formally introduced material parameters cannot satisfy the conditions of locality. In 2007, Tretyakov and colleagues explained the physical meaning of calculated material parameters, different from the meaning of the local constitutive parameters
High-impedance surfaces and metasurfaces.
High Impedance Surfaces (HIS), also known as Artificial Magnetic Conductors (AMC), are artificial structures designed by applying special textures to a conducting surface. In a narrow band of frequencies, these structures have very high impendences which can be used as ground planes for novel low profile antennas and other electromagnetic structures. In 2008, Tretyakov and colleagues developed analytical formulas for the calculation of the grid impedance of electrically dense arrays of strips and square patches and their applications for HIS. Tretyakov also made an important contribution to clarify the role of spatial dispersion in the mushroom structure in 2009. This work demonstrated that, under some conditions, spatial dispersion is suppressed. More recently, he worked on modelling and applications of thin composite layers with engineered electromagnetic properties (metasurfaces), in particular, developing approaches to full control of reflected and transmitted waves.

Nantai Temple () is a Buddhist temple located on Mount Heng, in Nanyue District of Hengyang, Hunan, China. It has been classified as a National Key Buddhist Temple in Han Chinese Area in 1983.
History.
Nantai Temple was first built in the Tianjian period of Liang dynasty (502-557) by master Haiyin ().
In 742, in the 2nd year of Tianbao period of Tang dynasty (618-907), Shitou Xiqian came to build a Buddhist temple here.
During the Hongzhi period (502-519) of Ming dynasty (1368-1644), a Buddhist temple was rebuilt by master Wu'ai (). 
During the Qianlong period of Qing dynasty (1644-1911), buildings and halls of Nantai Temple collapsed for neglect. In 1899, in the 25th year of Guangxu period, the reconstruction works started and lasted 5 years. In 1907, a Japanese Buddhist monk named donated 5,700 volumes of Buddhist scriptures and 32 palm leaf manuscripts to the temple. 
During the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards had attacked the temple. 5,700 volumes of Buddhist scriptures and 32 palm leaf manuscripts were either removed, damaged or destroyed. Many original Buddha statues and musical instruments of the temple had been devastated. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, according to the national policy of free religious belief, Nantai Temple was reconstructed and reopened. In 1981, a Thai Chinese couple Huang Zhangren () and Ouyang Yu () presented a gilt bronze Buddha statue to the temple. In 1983, Nantai Temple was rated as a National Key Buddhist Temple in Han Chinese Area. In 1987, master Baotan () was proposed as abbot of the temple. Under his leadership, the temple began a large-scale reconstruction project.

History of Hinduism in Afghanistan

The history of Hinduism in Afghanistan can be traced a long before from its modern-day existence from the Ancient times, earlier than 34,000 years old. Hinduism has been said to be flourished in the region mainly during the Bronze Age and Indus Valley Civilisation, where the Gandhara was a mahajanapada. The religion has seen a further expansion during the Aryan expansion into Mesopotamia and the Medean rule from . They includes notably the Gandhari people. After that the Zoroastrianism and Buddhism also flourished in the region due to the influence of Maurya and Achaemenid Empire. Under the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, the Greco and Gandharan Buddhism also influenced the Afghan region. Since then, many empires have risen from Afghanistan, including the Kushans, Hephthalites, Saffarids, Samanids and Hindu Shahi have seen and made on Hindu culture of the land.
After the muslim conquests of Afghanistan and defeat on Jayapala by Turk Shahis and annexation of land under the Rashidun Caliphate, the rise of Islam in Afghanistan was seen which decrease in Hindus and Buddhists in the region. There were several invasion of Mongols and Ghaznavids were seen. Hinduism in Afghanistan was revived after the Battle of Nowshera and annexation of the land under the Sikh Empire by Hari Singh Nalwa, along with the Sikhism.
After the 17th-century after the establishment of Afghanistan by the Hotak dynasty, most of the Hindus were indulge in the upper positions and business works. The main ethnic groups in Afghanistan which practice Hinduism today are the Punjabis and Sindhis who are believed to have come along with Sikhs as merchants to Afghanistan in the 19th century. Till the collapse of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, there were several thousand Hindus living in the country but today their number is only about 1,000. Most of the others immigrated to India, the European Union, North America or elsewhere.
Ancient history.
Pre-historic era.
There are no official sources for correct dates of flourishment of Hinduism in Afghanistan, though it is believed that earlier before the introduction of modern form of Hinduism the Afghans used to follow the Surya worship, and Paganism that was influenced by the Hinduism. They were used to be the farmers and animal herders.
Indus Valley civilization.
According to the archaeologists, the Indus Valley civilisation was the time when the Hindu religion flourished in the Afghanistan and was mainly followed by the people living in the Hindu Kush and the modern-day Afghania. An Indus Valley site has been found on the Oxus River at Shortugai in northern Afghanistan. The early form of Hinduism was mainly followed by the Nuristanis. The Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex became prominent between 2200 and 1700 BCE (approximately). The city of Balkh (Bactra) was founded about this time () and was believed that through this Hinduism spread to middle east with minor and small colonies there.
Indo-Aryan migration.
Between , a branch of Indo-European-speaking tribes known as the Aryans began migrating into the region. This is part of a dispute in regards to the Indo-Aryan migration. The Avesta is believed to have been composed possibly as early as and written in ancient Ariana (Aryana), the earliest name of Afghanistan which indicates an early link with today's Iranian tribes to the west, or adjacent regions in Central Asia or northeastern Iran in the . The Indo-Aryan tribes were known to have Rigvedic tribe and have followed the Rigvedic religion. The Indo-Aryan inhabitants of the region including Pashayi and Nuristanis were known to be followers of the Hinduism. The Pashtuns were also considered to have the Vedic ancestors of the Pakthas, though there have been claims of Pashtuns to be the ancestors of 10 lost tribes of Israelites. 
Gandhara Empire.
The Gandhāran Buddhist texts have been found as a source of existence of Hinduism and was also found in the Rigveda. The Buddhism was also seen flourished and most of the Buddhists were converted from Hinduism. The Mahabharata characters of Shakuni and Gandhari were known to be from the Gandhara Empire. The inhabitants of the empire were called as the Gandharvas and were described as Gandharis having their lineage from Hindu text, Rig Vedas. Gandharvas were well versed in music and art. This explains why there is much Gandhara influence in Indian Classical Music. The Yadava chief Bala Rama (brother of Krishna) also describes the interaction between the Gandharva and people of Indus valley.
Maurya Empire.
The Maurya Empire contributed significantly in the art in the nation which was mainly based on the Hindu and Buddhist art. The wars of Alexander and Seleucus I Nicator with the Seleucid–Mauryan war have significantly contributed in the religious and cultural diversity of the nation.
Classical period.
The Hinduism has seen many changes and religious expansions and changes during the Classical history period of Afghanistan from and had seen a good relationship. The reason for this is that both Hinduism and Buddhism have common roots, and over most of their history have not been seen as separate communions, but rather rival tendencies within a shared religious tradition. There had several kingdom in the land during that period including the Hellenistic kingdom including the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom and other including the Indian empire, Indo-Parthians and other regional including the Hephthalite Empire and Hun Empire. The Hinduism seen a revival in Afghanistan after the Kushan Empire and mainly after the Gupta Empire leading to Greater India and the Indianisation of the Afghan Hindus.
There were several Hindu Temples and seals were created and used by the emperors and kings depicting Hindu deities and there are also seen a lot of art and heritage of Hindus mainly in Gandhara and Ghazni region.
Middle Ages.
From the Middle Ages to around 1750, Afghanistan was part of Iran. This was the times of increase in Hindus in the country and the time when country came in its existence of modern form. During this time the Hinduism was at the peak under the Kabul Shahis and Hindu Shahi, before the Islamic conquest of India and Afghanistan.
Islamic conquest.
In , the Rashidun Caliphate made conquest in Afghanistan as an early part of Muslim conquest. The Turk Shahis under Rashidun Caliphate made Afghanistan, a vessal territory under which the Hindus and Buddhist have to pay the "Jizya". Buddhist and Zoroastrians were considered as the "people of book" (or 'kitabi'), while Hindus were known to be idol-worshipper. Then after the conquest the population of Hindus and Buddhists start declining very fastly, accompanied by a sharp rise in the population of Muslims.
Kabul Shahi.
The Kabul Shahi dynasties ruled the Kabul Valley and Gandhara from the decline of the Kushan Empire in the 3rd century to the early 9th century. The Kabul Shahis were the Turkic migration to the Afghanistan, who were Muslims and were succeeded by the Hindu Shahi, who were Hindus.
King Jayapala of Hindu Shahi was known to be the last Hindu king of Afghanistan and was known for his struggle against the Ghaznavids, though he was lost despite having good army strength and was also accompanied by the Rajput and Punjabi Hindus.
After the lost to Hindu forces against Mahmud Ghaznavi, Hindus remained minority in Afghanistan and lead to end of Hindu and Buddhist rule in Afghanistan.
Ghaznavids.
Under the Ghaznavids, the Islam was flourished in the region was accompanied by the total decline of Hindus and other non-Muslim communities in Afghanistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, though Nuristan was only place where the Hindus were found significantly and ruled the province. The region was termed as the Kafiristan (). The region was also attacked by the Ghaznavids and was described as:
Further decline.
Afghanistan was repeatedly raided and had many battles against the Turkics, Arabs and others due to its ideal position connecting Central Asia and Indian subcontinent. Several Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent through Afghanistan have led to further decline in Hindus population.
Mughal Empire.
After the repeated conquest and war in Afghanistan, the Hindus population dwindled, though many of them remained in the nation when the region came under the Mughal Empire for trade and military purposes, notably after Babur conquered the Kabul and named it as "Hindustan Bazar" (). Under the reign of Akbar as he appointed many Hindus in the upper positions in the empire. 
Sikh Empire.
After the Battle of Nowshera and Saidu, when the Sikh Empire came into prominence under the leadership of Ranjit Singh and the expanded their territories till Kabul River, there was a re-introduction of Hinduism and Sikhism in Afghanistan due to the Khalsa Empire. Under the leadership of Hari Singh Nalwa many laws were introduced in the Sikh territories to protect Hindus and their religious sentiments, including capital punishment for cow slaughter. Many Hindus were appointed in the administration and bureacracy in the Kabul, after the defeat of Dost Mohammad Khan in the Battle of Jamrud, which lead to re-introduction and prominence of Hindus in the Afghanistan, along with Sikhs and many Hindu temples were also re-constructed in the Kabul and other Sikh territories. Most of the Hindus were either Punjabis and Sindhis.

Emma Hannigan

Emma Denise Hannigan (25 September 1972 – 3 March 2018) was an Irish author and blogger, best known for writing about her experience of suffering from cancer.
Early life.
The daughter of Denise, a Montessori teacher who ran a home school, and Philip, manager of a local engineering firm, Hannigan was raised in Bray, County Wicklow. She attended the town's St Gerard's School with her older brother, Timmy. She enjoyed writing, but her favourite teacher ended up having to insist on a word limit.
After leaving school, she attended Ballymaloe Cookery School in Co. Cork for a three-month course, but stayed there for three years. She then worked as a chef and ran her own catering business. She later switched to beauty therapy.
Cancer and writing.
With a family history of breast and ovarian cancer, Hannigan's mother and maternal aunt tested positive for the responsible gene, BRCA1. She also received a 'positive' result in August 2005, which carries an 85% risk of developing breast cancer and a 50% risk of ovarian cancer. Hannigan underwent preventative surgery the following year to reduce the risk of cancer developing to 5%. However, breast cancer soon developed, "in the neck, shoulder and under my arm", in 2007. After repeated treatment, a tumour always reappeared. She told Barry Egan of the "Irish Independent" in the summer of 2016: "The lumps were getting bigger" while "The medicine was making me really sick. Yet it wasn't working". In all, Hannigan's cancer returned another nine times.
Hannigan began to write in the first period while she was in hospital recovering from the (unsuccessful) preventative surgery. She always quickly closed her laptop when her closest friend, the established writer Cathy Kelly, was visiting her. She eventually confessed to Kelly about writing and, after overcoming her anxiety to share her work, emailed her story with the proviso: "If it’s awful, say nothing. We’ll pretend I didn’t give it to you and we’ll never mention it again". Kelly believed Hannigan's work should be published. After sending print outs to several people, Hannigan soon received two offers, and soon afterwards, a contract for three books. "Designer Genes", her debut novel, which draws on her experience of illness, was published in Ireland in 2009.
A dozen books followed her debut, including novels and memoirs. "The Pink Ladies Club" (2011), was on the shortlist for the Eason Irish Popular Fiction Book of the Year category of the 2011 Irish Book Awards.
A fortnight before she died, Hannigan announced on her blog that her cancer was now terminal. After a sales campaign by friends and colleagues, her last book, "Letters to My Daughters" reached the top of the Nielsen BookScan bestseller list in Ireland at the end of February 2018. All profits from the book will be donated to the Irish Cancer Society.
Death and legacy.
Hannigan died on 3 March 2018, aged 45. Irish President, Michael D. Higgins, paid tribute saying she "leaves a lasting legacy" and was "a powerful advocate for Breast Cancer Ireland".
Her husband, Cian McGrath (the couple married in June 1998) and their two children survive her.
It was announced in April 2018 that a cancer research fellowship at the Royal College of Surgeons would be named in her honour.

Himmo, King of Jerusalem

Himmo, King of Jerusalem (Hebrew: חימו מלך ירושלים, tr. "Himmo Melech Yerushalaim") is a 1987 Israeli independent underground dramatic art film directed by Amos Guttman.
Plot.
Adapted by from an eponymous 1966 novel by Yoram Kaniuk, the film, set in an abandoned monastery-turned-clinic (the film was shot at the Monastery of the Cross), unfolds during the siege of Jerusalem in 1948. A young and beautiful volunteer nurse, Hamutal Horowitz (Alona Kimhi), is romantically drawn to the enigmatic Himmo Perach (Ofer Shikartsi), a mortally wounded and mutilated soldier and former charismatic philanderer who cannot speak (except when he asks to be shot, though nobody in the monastery has the courage to do so) or move as he had most of his limbs removed without anesthesia due to severe shortages. Jealousy amongst the other patients, all in love with Hamutal though receiving only professional care, soon begins to emerge.
The film, financed by the and developed at , stars "inter alia" , Mika Rottenberg, , , , Amos Lavi, , , and Sivan Shavit and has cinematography by , production by Enrique Rottenberg, and music by (in addition to the 1946 song "", written by Haim Hefer and , performed by Shoshana Damari).
Reception.
It was screened and won several prizes at the 1988 Toronto International Film Festival, San Francisco International Film Festival, Haifa International Film Festival, and 1988 Chicago International Film Festival, despite being a commercial flop with only 21,000 tickets sold.
Journalist Meir Schnitzer dismissed the film for its "lack of plot" and "visual ugliness", and similar pontifications were voiced by other journalists such as , who dismissed its "pretentiousness" and called it a stain on the Israeli film "industry", and , who called it “miserable, tiring, heavy, a boring and slow film in which nothing happens” and complained that it utilized "too much dialogue and too little action".
Outside Israel, where the film was distributed by the National Center for Jewish Film, "TV Guide" also dismissed the "stagy, with a fair amount of speechmaking" approach. The film was released on DVD in Israel by as part of a boxset containing the complete filmography of Guttman and an equivalent boxset was released in France by . Several nowadays notable Israeli film people, such as Rony Gruber, Samuel Maoz, Shva Salhoov, and started out as crew bit parts on this film.

The Nanny (season 5)

The fifth season of the American television sitcom "The Nanny" aired on CBS from October 1, 1997, to May 13, 1998. The series was created by actress Fran Drescher and her-then husband Peter Marc Jacobson, and developed by Prudence Fraser and Robert Sternin. Produced by Sternin and Fraser Ink and TriStar Television, the series features Drescher, Jacobson, Fraser, Sternin, Caryn Lucas and Diane Wilk as executive producers.
Based on an idea inspired by Drescher's visit with a friend and "The Sound of Music", the season revolves around Fran Fine, a Jewish woman from Flushing, Queens, New York, who is hired by a wealthy Broadway producer to be the nanny to his three children. Drescher stars as the titular character, Charles Shaughnessy as British-born producer Maxwell Sheffield, and the children – Maggie, Brighton and Grace – portrayed by Nicholle Tom, Benjamin Salisbury, and Madeline Zima. The series also features Daniel Davis as Niles, the family butler, and Lauren Lane as C.C. Babcock, Maxwell's associate in his production company who is smitten with him. Several recurring characters also played a role in the sitcoms plotlines, many of whom were related to Fran.
Lauren Lane was pregnant through half the season, which was covered up by a scripted weight gain and a character arc that allowed her to be absent for several episodes.

FS Class 396

FS Class 396 was a class of 0-6-0 steam locomotives originally built for the Victor Emmanuel Railway (VE). They were designed for hauling passenger trains and were nicknamed "Mammoth".
History.
VE ordered six locomotives from the Cail rolling stock factory and they were delivered in 1860. They were numbered 37-42. In 1865 the locomotives passed to the Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (SFAI), which renumbered them 703-708, and later (probably in 1869) 767-772. In 1885, at the creation of the great national networks, the locomotives passed to the Rete Mediterranea (RM) and took the numbers 3942-3947. In 1905, at the time of nationalization, only five units arrived at the FS, which registered them as Class 396 with numbers from 3961-3965. They remained in service until 1911. By then, they were obsolete and they were scrapped in 1912.
Technical details.
The locomotives were of simple design. The boiler pressure was 7 bar and they had two inside cylinders and Stephenson valve gear.

Julie Gough

Julie Gough (born 1965) is an artist, writer and curator based in Tasmania, Australia. She was born in St. Kilda, Melbourne, and has also lived in Western Australia and Queensland.
Her paternal heritage is Scottish and Irish. Her maternal Aboriginal heritage is of the Trawlwoolway people of Tebrikunna, and her lineage has been traced to her ancestor, great-great-great-grandmother Dolly Dalrymple.
Education.
In 1986, Gough completed a Bachelor of Arts (pre-history and anthropology) at the University of Western Australia, and in 1994, she completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts at the School of Art at Curtin University. In 1993, she moved from Perth to Tasmania to undertake her doctorate exploring her family history and heritage.
Her thesis focused on reinterpreting the past via the artistic display of disparate objects which reframe narratives, completed at the University of Tasmania in 2001.
Career.
Gough's sculptural works have included the use of kitsch bric-a-brac sourced from op shops, often featuring racist or dated motifs. Using these relics in her art is about challenging and subverting their historical meanings.
In 2001, her work, "Driving Black Home" (2000) contrasted with John Glover's colonial depiction of Tasmania, as part of the "Australian Collection Focus series" at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The Gallery withheld Benjamin Law's busts of Woureddy and Trucaninny from the exhibition at Gough's request, noting their history as anthropological objects.
In September 2001, she presented on the "Archaeology of nostalgia" at the "Portraiture and Place" "symposium" (jointly run by the National Portrait Gallery and the University of Tasmania).
For the bicentenary of Federation, Gough was commissioned by the National Gallery of Victoria to create an artwork in response to Emanuel Phillips Fox's "The Landing of Captain Cook". The resulting installation, "Chase", a suspended ti-tree forest with symbolic red cloth, was reviewed by Gabriella Coslovich as sitting in an "...uneasy relationship..." in display alongside Fox's painting. Margaretta Pos reviewed the work as having stillness and menace, with a sense of "...redcoats in the shadows." One of the Gallery's deputy art directors, Frances Lindsay, described the work as extending the narrative from the painting, to the unseen context of displacement of Aboriginal people.
Gough's undertook a residency at Woolmers Estate in 2018, researching her familial connections to Norfolk Plains, Woolmers and Brickendon estates.
A survey exhibition of her work entitled "Tense Past: Julie Gough" opened at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery in 2019.
She worked as a curator of Indigenous art at the National Gallery of Victoria from 2003 until December 2004. She was a lecturer in visual arts at the James Cook University in 2005, and also has a part-time role at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery.
In 2020 Gough featured as one of six Indigenous artists in the ABC TV series "This Place: Artist Series". The series is a partnership between the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the National Gallery of Australia, in which the producers travelled to the countries of "some of Australia's greatest Indigenous artists to share stories about their work, their country, and their communities".
Public collections.
Gough's work is held in public collections, including:
Art Gallery of New South Wales

Anti-Zionist purge in the Polish Army

The anti-Zionist purge in the Polish Army was the removal from the Polish People's Army of soldiers of Jewish origin, carried out in year 1968 following Six-Day War between Israel and Arab countries.
Background.
The Polish People's Army was a successor of the Polish armies formed in the Soviet Union during WW2. Due to the mass execution of Polish officers in the Katyn Massacre, most of officers were people, who were educated in Soviet Union, with a large proportion having Jewish roots. Some Jewish officers were also promoted due to suspected loyalty towards Soviet Union.
Following the establishment of Israel in 1948, Stalin disappointed by pro-American stand of Israel oriented Soviet police against people of Jewish roots. However, this policy didn't propagate to Polish People's Army, where many people sympathized with Israel. 
Following the Six-Day War Soviet Union considered military action against Israel and concerted the Eastern Bloc countries to break the diplomatic ties with Israel.
March crisis.
Following a meeting of Eastern European countries in Moscow, Polish leadership realized that Poland and Israel are now firmly in 2 opposite blocks and in case of armed conflict there could be loyalty conflict for officers of Jewish roots.
As result, in 1967-1968 Anti-Zionist purges were performed, and culminated in the so-called March events.
General Wojciech Jaruzelski, a member of the top management of the Ministry of Defence, and from April 11, 1968, Minister of Defence, who headed a special committee, was to be responsible for the purge in the army. General Teodor Kufel, the head of the Military Internal Service was also co-responsible.
There is no unanimous agreement on the number of officers removed as part of the purge. indicated the number of several dozen, Anka Grupińska - 150. reported that six orders containing 1348 names (both officers and petty officers) had survived, and added that soldiers of Jewish origin were being removed from the army by General Jaruzelski in 1980.
The people affected by the purge were deprived of the officer rank "because of the lack of moral values" and degraded (e. g. ).
Anti-Semitic character of purges.
During the purge, a number of officers were dismissed only because of their Jewish roots and without proof of their loyalty towards Israel. This makes the purge of having Anti-Semitic character.

<doc id="56747378" url="?curid=56747378" title="Resistive pulse sensing">
Resistive pulse sensing

Resistive pulse sensing (RPS) is the generic, non-commercial term given for the well-developed technology used to detect, and measure the size of, individual particles in fluid. First invented by Wallace H. Coulter in 1953, the RPS technique is the basic principle behind the Coulter Principle, which is a trademark term. Resistive pulse sensing is also known as the electrical zone sensing technique, reflecting its fundamentally electrical nature, which distinguishes it from other particle sizing technologies such as the optically-based dynamic light scattering (DLS) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). An international standard has been developed for the use of the resistive pulse sensing technique by the International Organization for Standardization.
Construction and operation. The basic design principle underlying resistive pulse sensing is shown in Fig. 1. Individual particles, suspended in a conductive fluid, flow one-at-a-time through a constriction. The fluids most commonly used are water containing some amount of dissolved salts, sufficient to carry an electrical current. The salinity levels of seawater or of a wide range of concentrations of phosphate-buffered saline are easily sufficient for this purpose, with electrical conductivity in the mS-S range and salt concentrations of order 1 percent. Typical tap water often contains sufficient dissolved minerals to conduct sufficiently for this application as well.
Electrical contact is made with the fluid using metal electrodes, in the best case using platinum or other low electrode potential metals, as are found in electrochemical cell constructions. Biasing the electrodes with an electrical potential of order 1 volt will cause an electrical current to flow through the fluid. If properly designed, the electrical resistance of the constriction will dominate in the total electrical resistance of the circuit. Particles that flow through the constriction while the electrical current is being monitored will cause an obscuration of that current, resulting in an increase in the voltage drop between the two electrodes. In other words, the particle causes a change in the electrical resistance of the constriction. The change in the electrical resistance as a particle passes through a constriction is shown schematically in Fig. 2.
Theory of operation. The quantitative relationship between the measured change in electrical resistance and the size of the particle that caused that change was worked out by De Blois and Bean in 1970. De Blois and Bean found the very simple result that the resistance change formula_1 is proportional to the ratio of particle volume formula_2 to the effective volume formula_3 of the constriction: 
formula_4,
where formula_5 is a factor that depends on the detailed geometry of the constriction and the electrical conductivity of the working fluid.
Hence, by monitoring the electrical resistance as indicated by changes in the voltage drop across the constriction, one can count particles, as each increase in resistance indicates passage of a particle through the constriction, and one can measure the size of that particle, as the magnitude of the resistance change during the particle passage is proportional to that particle's volume. As one can usually calculate the volumetric flow rate of fluid through the constriction, controlled externally by setting the pressure difference across the constriction, one can then calculate the concentration of particles. With a large enough number of particle transients to provide adequate statistical significance, the concentration as a function of particle size, also known as the concentration spectral density, with units of per volume fluid per volume particle, can be calculated.
Minimum detectable size and dynamic range. Two important considerations when evaluating a resistive pulse sensing (RPS) instrument are the minimum detectable particle size and the dynamic range of the instrument. The minimum detectable size is determined by the volume formula_3 of the constriction, the voltage difference applied across that constriction, and the noise of the first-stage amplifier used to detect the particle signal. In other words, one must evaluate the minimum signal-to-noise of the system. The minimum particle size can be defined as the size of the particle that generates a signal whose magnitude is equal to the noise, integrated over the same frequency bandwidth as generated by the signal. The dynamic range of an RPS instrument is set at its upper end by the diameter of the constriction, as that is the maximum size particle that can pass through the constriction. One can also instead choose a somewhat smaller maximum, perhaps setting it to 70 percent of this maximum volume. The dynamic range is then equal to the ratio of the maximum particle size to the minimum detectable size. This ratio can be quoted either as the ratio of the maximum to minimum particle volume, or as the ratio of the maximum to minimum particle diameter (the cube of the first method).
Microfluidic Resistive Pulse Sensing (MRPS).
The original Coulter counter was originally designed using a special technology to fabricate small pores in glass volumes, but the expense and complexity of fabricating these elements means they become a semi-permanent part of the analytic RPS instrument. This also limited the minimum diameter constrictions that could be reliably fabricated, making the RPS technique challenging to use for particles below roughly 1 micron in diameter.
There was therefore significant interest in applying the fabrication techniques developed for microfluidic circuits to RPS sensing. This translation of RPS technology to the microfluidic domain enables very small constrictions, well below effective diameters of 1 micron; this therefore extends the minimum detectable particle size to the deep sub-micron range. Using microfluidics technology also allows the use of inexpensive cast plastic or elastomer parts for defining the critical constriction component, which also become disposable. The use of a disposable element eliminates concerns about sample cross-contamination as well as obviating the need for time-consuming cleaning of the RPS instrument. Scientific advances demonstrating these capabilities have been published in the scientific literature, such as by Kasianowicz et al., Saleh and Sohn, and Fraikin et al.. These together illustrate a variety of methods to fabricate microfluidic or lab-on-a-chip versions of the Coulter counter technology.

Paride da Ceresara

Paride da Ceresara (10 February 1466 – 1532) was an Italian humanist, poet, alchemist and astrologer.
Life.
He was born in Ceresara and was descended from the Ceresara, a noble family. He was in the service of Isabella d'Este in Mantua and came up with the mythological, allegorical and celebratory themes for at least two of the paintings in her noted studiolo and perhaps the whole cycle. Paride collected and translated classical works such as Plautus' "Aulularia" and also studied Hebrew. He also wrote a number of erotic sonnets, signed with his pseudonyms Patrizio Tricasso and Patrizio Tricasso da Ceresara.
He was hosted at the court of Aloisio Gonzaga in Castel Goffredo as an astrologer. He was summoned to Mantua in 1532 by Federico II Gonzaga to become podestà of the city, where Paride built the Palazzo del Diavolo on the corso Predella (now corso Vittorio Emanuele II) as his personal residence. He died in Mantua.

Belapur Ki Dayan

Belapur Ki Dayan (; ) is a Pakistani supernatural horror drama series directed by Saife Hassan, and written by Inam Hasan. It features Sarah Khan, Adnan Siddiqui, Osama Tahir in leads whilst Amar Khan played the main antagonist.
Synopsis.
The story revolves around Aziz (Shakeel) who has recently moved to his ancestral home after winning a 32-year-long court battle with his step brother. In the house, his whole family is disturbed with the supernatural presence, which turns out to be the spirit of his step sister Nilofar (Amar Khan). Nilofar wants to take revenge from him for a wrongdoing in the past. Thus she tortures and disturbs the life of his family for living in her home. She corrupts the souls of Natasha, aka Tasha (Sarah Khan), the daughter of Aziz, and possesses her body to affect her life negatively. In the meanwhile, the lives of Aziz's son Rameez (Osama Tahir), his wife Aliya (Rayyan Ibrahim), son Wajdan (Nitesh Narayan) and daughter Mannat (Shifa), are deeply disturbed by the supernatural spirits, especially Nelofar. Aziz decides to tame Nilofar and seeks the help of her ex-lover Shakir (Adnan Siddiqui) for Tasha's treatment. What will the family experience now?
Production.
Amar in an interview said; "I’m playing characters from two different time periods, one of a fragile innocent girl of the 80’s reading Parveen Shakir’s shayari and the other, a current time period sarcastic and ruthless Dayan who is there to attain revenge,"[ ... ]“It’s been given very realistic treatment. My director’s very much hanging me with cables in the air and he’s making me do all these acrobats, so it’s no longer a bedroom drama where I shed a tear or two, or even play a glamorous nagin; nothing of such sort.”
While Adnan shared with The News about his character “I play the dayan’s love interest in the project,"[ ... ] “After her death, I am called in the same house by the owner whose daughter is being haunted and I am there to save her. I will be seen in 10 episodes and the drama takes you into flashbacks and then in present.”

The Nanny (season 6)

The sixth and final season of the American television sitcom "The Nanny" aired on CBS from September 30, 1998, to June 23, 1999. The series was created by actress Fran Drescher and her-then husband Peter Marc Jacobson, and developed by Prudence Fraser and Robert Sternin. Produced by Sternin and Fraser Ink and TriStar Television, the series features Drescher, Jacobson, Fraser, Sternin, Caryn Lucas and Diane Wilk as executive producers.
Based on an idea inspired by Drescher's visit with a friend and "The Sound of Music", the season revolves around Fran Fine, a Jewish woman from Flushing, Queens, New York, who is hired by a wealthy Broadway producer to be the nanny to his three children. Drescher stars as the titular character, Charles Shaughnessy as British-born producer Maxwell Sheffield, and the children – Maggie, Brighton and Grace – portrayed by Nicholle Tom, Benjamin Salisbury, and Madeline Zima. The series also features Daniel Davis as Niles, the family butler, and Lauren Lane as C.C. Babcock, Maxwell's associate in his production company who is smitten with him. Several recurring characters also played a role in the sitcoms plotlines, many of whom were related to Fran.
The opening sequence changed slightly in this season. Producer Kathy Landsburg was promoted to co-executive producer of the series as her producer credit was moved to the in-show credits, while the creator credits of Drescher and Jacobson, and the developer credits of Sternin and Fraser were added in its place.
Beginning with this season, Renée Taylor, Ann Guilbert and Rachel Chagall are credited as "starring" during the in-show credits.
During the show's original run this season, the show went on a hiatus after the episode "California Here We Come" with the two-part finale airing several weeks later in May. However, six further first-run episodes aired in June, disrupting the chronological continuance of the show. This was remedied in syndication when the two-part finale was moved after the last aired episode from the first-run ("The Baby Shower").
Rachel Chagall was pregnant through half the season.

History.
During the Eastern Han dynasty (25-220), the temple was a Taoist temple and formerly known as "Guangtian Taoist Temple" ().
In the Daye period of Sui dynasty (581-618), Emperor Yang of Sui toured the temple and ordered the temple to convert to Buddhism, and inscribed and honored the name "Shangfeng Temple" ().
In the Jiajing period of Ming dynasty (1368-1644), the Hall of Four Heavenly Kings was added to the temple. Luo Zhan (), a Buddhist believer, presented iron statues of the Four Heavenly Kings to the temple.
In the Kangxi period of Qing dynasty (1644-1911), Hunan Governor Zhou Zhaonan () put master Yimu forward as abbot. Under his leadership, the temple had reached unprecedented heyday. In the Tongzhi period, Zeng Guoquan, donated property to renovate the temple.
In 1927, abbot Suchan () was killed by the Nationalist government. Then the temple have been desolated and the buildings and halls have been torn down. In 1932, master Baosheng () was proposed as the abbot of Shangfeng Temple. Under his leadership, the Hall of Four Heavenly Kings and Mahavira Hall was rebuilt, the Hall of Guru, Meditation Hall and Monk's Bedroom were added to the temple. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Mount Heng was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army, most of the temple buildings were destroyed in the battle of Hunan.
In 1983, Shangfeng Temple was authorized as a National Key Buddhist Temple in Han Chinese Area. In 1987, a large-scale reconstruction project began.

Kommunarka () is a Moscow Metro station on the Sokolnicheskaya line. It was opened on June 20, 2019, along with Filatov Lug, Prokshino, and Olkhovaya. and became the southwestern terminus of the line, after Olkhovaya station. Kommunarka became the 232nd station of the Moscow Metro.
It is in the Kommunarka area of Sosenskoye Settlement in the Novomoskovsky Administrative Okrug southwest of Moscow. It is became the southern terminus of the line.
History.
The city government decided to extend the line to Stolbovo in February 2016; an unexpected decision given that the city initially planned to extend the line only to Filatov Lug. The initial cost of the line was about 45 billion rubles. In July 2017, the city government confirmed that the extension would move forward, allowing construction to continue.
In March 2017, the city began clearing space around the planned station to accommodate the construction.
The station's working name during most of construction was Stolbovo. This derived from the former village of Stolbovo, which became part of the current settlement when it was incorporated into the City of Moscow from Moscow Oblast.
Design and Layout.
Kommunarka is at the intersection of the Solntsevo-Butovo-Varshavskoye shosse highway and the Ostafyevo International Airport section of the Moscow Ring Road. It has two lobbies, one that exits across the highway via an underground pedestrian walkway, and a second that leads to a future station on the planned Kommunarskaya line.

Thismia neptunis is a species of "Thismia" endemic to Borneo. It was discovered by Italian botanist Odoardo Beccari in 1866, and described in 1878. It was not observed again until 2017, when it was first photographed by a team of biologists from the Czech Republic. It was found in the Gunung Matang massif in western Sarawak, in the Malaysian part of the island of Borneo.
"T. neptunis" lives underground, and is a myco-heterotroph, a plant which obtains nutrients through a parasitic relationship with fungi. It does not bloom every year, and when it does, its flower appears above the soil for only a few weeks.

Travel document (Poland)

Travel document is the official identity document in Poland for a person who is not a Polish citizen.
Such a document was issued to Polish citizens who renounced Polish citizenship so that they could go abroad. The document stated the identity of the person and the fact that "the holder of this document is not a Polish citizen".
During the wave of emigration in 1968, such a document was received, for example, by Jewish emigrants (and their non-Jewish spouses) or Germans leaving Poland after the Second World War.
Currently, a Polish travel document for a foreigner is issued to a foreigner who holds a permit to reside, a long-term EC residence permit or who enjoys subsidiary protection.

Scrabby, Corlough

Scrabby () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Scrabby is bounded on the north by Derryvahan and Tawnagh townlands, on the south by Derry More townland, on the west by Derry Beg and Garvary (Corlough) townlands and on the east by Prospect, Corlough townland. Its chief geographical features are Brackley Lough, small streams, spring wells and dug wells. Scrabby is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 189 statute acres.
History.
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish "Baile Biataigh" (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Scrabby was located in the ballybetagh of "Bally Cloinelogh" (alias 'Bally Cloynelough'). The original Irish is "Baile Cluain Loch", meaning 'The Town of the Lake Meadow') 
The 1609 Ulster Plantation Baronial Map depicts the townland as part of "Gortatawill". (Irish name, either Gort an Tuathail meaning 'The Field facing away from the Sun' or Gort an Eochaille meaning "The Field of the Yew Wood".)
The 1665 Down Survey map depicts Scrabby as "Sheribagh and Renbeg". The southern part of the townland jutting into Brackley Lough was called Rinnbeg meaning 'The Small Promontory'. Rinnbeg was also called Gorteenboy.
William Petty’s 1685 map of Cavan depicts it as "Sheribagh and Renbeg".
In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 29 April 1611, King James VI and I granted "the town and lands of Gortatowill containing 6 polls, comprising a total of 300 acres at an annual rent of £3-4s., to Mulmore McHugh McFarrall O'Rely, gent". Mulmore O'Reilly was the grandson of the chief of the O'Reilly clan, Fearghal macSeaán, who ruled East Breifne from 1526–1534. His genealogy is "Maol Mórdha son of Aodh son of Fearghal son of Seaán son of Cathal son of Eóghan na Fésóige". Mulmore O'Reilly had four sons by his wife Honora- Émonn, Hugh O'Reilly (Archbishop of Armagh) (b. 1580, d. 1653), Fearghal and Domhnall. He also had an illegitimate son, Cathaoir. Mulmore died sometime between 1611 and 1637. He left his lands in Tawnagh to his son Émonn (Edmund) O'Reilly. Émonn had three sons, Aodh (Hugh), Cathal and Brian. An Inquisition held in Cavan Town on 12 September 1638 found that the said "Edm’ Relly recently of Gortetowell in Co. Cavan, in his life, was seised of a poll of land called Tawnagh, and of a poll called Carrick in said county. The said Edmund died on 29 September 1637. Hugh O’Reyly, his son and heir has reached his maturity and now holds the land from the king in free and common socage. Catherine Newgent, alias Reily, was the wife of the said Edmund and the aforesaid Catherine is dower of the premises." At the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 Hugh O'Reilly still held the townland according to the Books of Survey and Distribution. Hugh O'Reilly had two sons, Émonn and Phillip. Hugh's son Émonn had one son Sémus.
The aforesaid O’Reilly lands in Scrabby were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652. In 1657 "A list of the Papist Proprietors names in the County of Cavan, as they are returned in the Civill Surveys of the said County" gave the names of 20 landowners whose property was confiscated in the barony of Tullyhaw. These included Hugh O'Rely whose lands were distributed as follows-
In the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663 there were seven taxpayers in "Gartetoill- Thomas Magawran of Gartetoill, John Graham of the same, Tirlagh McKelagher of the same, Hugh McBrien of the same, Owen McKelacher of the same, Edmond O Helicke of the same and Hugh McGawran of the same".
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as "Skebby and Ranbeg and Gorteenboy" with the proprietor as "Lieutenant-Colonel Tristram Beresford" and the tenants as "William Chambers and others". A grant dated 3 November 1666 was made by King Charles II of England to the aforesaid Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet which included, inter alia, the lands of "Scirbagh and Rendbegg". By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King Charles II of England to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the said lands of "Scirbagh and Rendbegg" were included in the creation of a new "Manor of Beresford". Beresford then leased the land to John Graham who was in possession in 1676. In 1683 Robert Barry was the tenant. In 1696 Robert Saunders (Irish lawyer), one of the founders of the village of Swanlinbar, became the tenant. On 13 March 1706 Marcus Beresford, 1st Earl of Tyrone leased the lands of "Scrabagh alias Sherefbagh" to the said Robert Saunders, for a term of 99 years. His son later sold his leasehold interest to Colonel John Enery of Bawnboy. Deeds, tenant lists etc. relating to Scrabby from 1650 onwards are available at- by searching for 'Derryvella'.
The 1690 list of outlawed Irish Jacobites in County Cavan includes "John Graham and Thomas Graham of Gortatole, gents". John Graham was probably the man named in the Hearth Money Rolls above or his son.
The will of Philip Fitzpatrick of "Gratetowel" is dated 30 July 1735.
The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as "Skrebagh" and "Gortneyboy alias Rinbeg".
A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Scribogue or Scrabby".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list fourteen tithepayers in the townland.
The 1836 Ordnance survey Namebooks state- "Contains 191 acres of which 113 are cultivated, 16 of water, 19 of rough uncultivated pasture and 3 of bog...Soil inclines to clay and is intermixed with lime &amp; sandstone boulders...The townland is bounded on the south side by a large lake."
In the 19th century the landlord was Lord John Beresford, the Protestant Archbishop of Armagh. The muddled land history of the area prior to this is described in the 1838 Exchequer case, "Attorney General of Ireland v The Lord Primate".
The Scrabby Valuation Office Field books are available for 1839-1840.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 76, being 30 males and 46 females. There were thirteen houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 75, being 32 males and 43 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were twelve houses in the townland, of which one was uninhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists twenty-three landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 59, being 32 males and 27 females. There were ten houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
In 1871 the population of the townland was 53, being 23 males and 30 females. There were ten houses in the townland and all were inhabited.(page 296 of census)
In 1881 the population of the townland was 44, being 18 males and 26 females. There were eleven houses in the townland, one of which was uninhabited.
In 1891 the population of the townland was 41, being 19 males and 22 females. There were nine houses in the townland, of which one was uninhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are eight families listed in the townland,
 and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are ten families listed in the townland.
A description of Scrabby in the 1930s by John Duffy is available online.

Reception.
Journalist favorably compared this film to the works of Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Martin Scorsese, journalist blasted the film for its lack of "style" though he nonetheless called it one of the great Israeli films of the 1980s, while journalist Daniel Warth also noted the similarities to Fassbinder and Pier Paolo Pasolini, yet claimed that these remained on the surface only, as this film lacked a "message". Nevertheless, more recently, it came out as the 30th best Israeli film out of 40 listed in a poll of critics conducted by "Maariv", and also received two votes (Marat Parkhomovsky and ) in a similar 2018 survey of critics. The film, whose budget was said to be the equivalent of $400,000, was awarded several prizes by the Israeli Ministry of Economy and was screened at Chicago International Film Festival, despite being a commercial failure with only 32,000 tickets sold. The film was released on DVD in Israel by as part of a boxset containing the complete filmography of Guttman and an equivalent boxset was released in France by . Several nowadays notable Israeli film people, such as , , and , started out as crew bit parts on this film and it is said to be a big influence on Sivan Levy, who covered some of its music (such as the 1937 song "My Funny Valentine" by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart). A main character in Guttman's 1992 film "Amazing Grace" is also called Thomas, probably as homage to this film. A restaurant named after this film has opened in Tel Aviv-Yafo in 2019.

Mehul Choksi

Mehul Chinubhai Choksi (born 5 May 1959) is a fugitive Indian-born businessman living in Antigua and Barbuda, who is wanted by the Indian judicial authorities for criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust, cheating and dishonesty including delivery of property, corruption and money laundering. In an interview, Choksi claimed that he is innocent and all allegations against him are false, baseless and motivated by political expediency. Choksi holds Antiguan citizenship since 2017. He is the owner of Gitanjali Group, a retail jewellery company with 4,000 stores in India. An arrest warrant for Choksi has been issued in connection with the alleged Punjab National Bank fraud case. He was allegedly involved in stock market manipulation in 2013. In late May 2021, he had gone missing from Antigua and Barbuda. He was found and arrested in Dominica while trying to flee to Cuba in a boat. A Caribbean court has currently issued a stay on his repatriation from the Commonwealth of Dominica.
Early life.
Mehul Choksi was born on 5 May 1959 in Bombay, the son of Chinubhai Choksi. He was educated at G. D. Modi College in Palanpur, Gujarat. He has three children, a son and two daughters. One of his daughters married Akash Mehta, an Antwerp-based diamond merchant in December 2010. Choksi is the maternal uncle of fugitive businessman Nirav Modi.
His younger brother Chetan Chinubhai Choksi owned and operated a diamond company named Diminco NV, based in Antwerp, which had defaulted on a US$25.8 million payment to a subsidiary of ICICI Bank. In 2013, the bank litigated a lawsuit against Diminco NV, in commercial courts in Belgium and UK.
Career.
Choksi started his career in the gem and jewellery sector in 1975, and took over the leadership of Gitanjali Gems from his father in 1985, when it was focused on just rough and polished diamonds. He owns Gitanjali Group, which includes Gitanjali Gems.
Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case.
In March 2018, a special PMLA court issued non-bailable arrest warrants (NBWs) against Choksi, and his nephews Nirav Modi and Neeshal Deepak Modi, owner of Firestar Diamonds. They are suspected of colluding with two employees of Punjab National Bank (PNB), the country's second-largest state-owned lender, in an alleged $1.8 billion fraud. At least six PNB staff and at least six employees of Choksi and Modi have been arrested so far. Choksi is a fugitive of Indian government. Choksi has protested his innocence in an open letter. On 6 March 2018, the CBI detained Vipul Chitalia, the Vice-President of Gitanjali Group of Companies and a key aide of Choksi. Chitalia was arrested at Mumbai airport and remained in custody till March 2018. A designated PMLA authority held that 41 properties worth about Rs 1,210 crore, attached by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the name of Mehul Choksi and his associated firms, are money laundering assets and ordered that their attachment should continue. The central probe agency provisionally attached 15 flats and 17 office premises in Mumbai, a mall in Kolkata, a four-acre farm house in Alibaug and 231 acres of land at locations like Nashik, Nagpur, Panvel in Maharashtra and Villupuram in Tamil Nadu, in February 2018 under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in connection with the about US$2 billion alleged fraud at a Mumbai-based branch of the Punjab National Bank (PNB).
On 7 January 2018, Choksi left India to the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda. A few days later, the PNB scam was disclosed. On 15 January, he took the oath of citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda, where he applied for the citizenship in November 2017 under the country's Citizenship by Investment program. However, Indian authorities argue that he has not renounced his Indian citizenship. On 17 June, his lawyer informed the Bombay High Court that he left India for medical check-up and not to avoid prosecution in the case. Ever since, CBI has been trying to extradite him back to India.
On 23 May 2021, Choksi had gone missing in Antigua and Barbuda. He was last seen around 5:15 pm on 23 May before leaving his home in a car which has been recovered by the police in Jolly Harbour area. A probe has been launched to look for him. It was reported that he may have fled to Cuba. On 26 May, he was found in a nearby Caribbean country of Dominica while trying to flee to Cuba by a boat and is held by the local police. This flee attempt would make CBI's case of extraditing him to India in Antiguan courts stronger. His lawyer claimed that Choksi was kidnapped by whom Choksi believed to be Indian and Antiguan police and brought to Dominica by a boat. He also claimed that Choksi had a swollen eye and several bruises when he met Choksi. The High Court of Justice Commonwealth of Dominica has currently issued a stay order on his repatriation from the country.
On 29 May 2021, Choksi's pictures were surfaced by Antiguan media. In the pictures, Choksi sustained several injuries to his left hand and the left eye is bruised and swollen. Several Indian agencies were in touch with the Dominican government using diplomatic channels urging that he is an Indian citizen and that he had an Interpol Red Corner notice and he should be handed over to the Indian authorities. The opposition parties United Workers' Party of Dominica and United Progressive Party of Antigua and Barbuda are allegedly utilising this opportunity to support him against his deportation to India, in return for campaign funding.
In early June 2021, Choksi filed an affidavit in the High Court of Dominica claiming there was no arrest warrant against him when he left India in January 2018 seeking medical treatment in the USA. He also stated that he has no intentions of absconding from attending the court and that he doesn't intend to leave Dominica. He claimed medical issues and fear for his health in his bail petition. Antiguan Information Minister Melford Nicholas stated that they moved to rescind his Antiguan citizenship on the basis that he provided false information while applying for the citizenship. Choksi has challenged it in the court.

Biography.
Santos, a resident of Mount Shasta, California, competed in the B3 category for people with under 10% functional vision. Born with a misshapen right eye, Santos could see through his left eye without problem until an accident in 1981 led to it being struck by a golf ball. He lost the eye and had to rely on his near-sighted right eye with a contact lens. After the accident it was his brother who gave him the motivation to ski.
Santos competed in the B2 events at Innsbruck in the 1984 Winter Paralympics but failed to win a medal.

Clermont-Ferrand tramway (1890-1956)

The Clermont-Ferrand tramway was a tram system in the French city of Clermont-Ferrand between 1890 and 1956. A new system came into operation in 2006.
Company.
Permission to build a tram line between Montferrand and Royat, with a branch line heading to Clermont-Ferrand station, was granted to engineer Jean Claret () on 27 January 1888, who created the limited partnership Jean Claret &amp; Co. On 13 December 1893 this was replaced by the Clermont-Ferrand Electric Tramway Company ("Compagnie des tramways électriques de Clermont-Ferrand"), created on 2 May that same year. On 23 December 1911 this company merged with the Clermont-Ferrand-Puy-de-Dôme Railway Company ("Compagnie du chemin de fer de Clermont-Ferrand au sommet du Puy-de-Dôme"), responsible for running trains to the summit of the nearby Puy de Dôme volcano, to form the Clermont-Ferrand and Puy-de-Dôme Tramway Company ("Compagnie des tramways de Clermont-Ferrand et du Puy-de-Dôme").
History of the tram system.
The first tram line entered service on 7 January 1890. The system was unique in France at the time for using electric power supplied by overhead lines. The system was identical to that used by the Vevey–Montreux–Chillon–Villeneuve tramway in Switzerland. This first line, running on metre-gauge lines, connected the old district of Montferrand with the Place de Jaude in central Clermont. The rolling stock at the time consisted of twenty-two cars, each with two motorised axles for climbing hills. In 1902, a section connecting Jaude to Place Delille () via Place Gaillard () opened, followed in 1913 by a link to the station via the Rue des Salins and a short section heading north from Place Gaillard to the Fontgiève () district. In 1914, a line was opened between the suburb of Beaumont and the city centre, following what is now bus route 4.
Just after the First World War, the rolling stock was modernised. Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, new stock was regularly acquired to tackle increasing demand and serve new lines. In 1932, the system had at its disposal 33 engines and 24 trailers. Following the war, the Beaumont line was extended to Ceyrat. Clermont residents quickly took to travelling out to the countryside on Sundays, and numerous restaurants, bars and cafés sprung up on the main road in Ceyrat. In 1928, a line to Aubière was created, following current bus route 3.
In the wake of the Second World War, the Clermont tram system only suffered minor cuts. Despite its rolling stock dating from the 1930s, the system remained popular and well-appreciated. However, new attitudes towards urban planning obliged authorities to lend priority to the private automobile, and a program of "traffic improvement" was initiated. Wide boulevards were created by removing trees, one-way streets were put in place, traffic lights were erected, and the tramways, which occupied the middle of the thoroughfares and obstructed the flow of cars, were removed. From 1950, the lines were progressively replaced by bus routes.
The network disappeared between 1933 and 1956. The final Clermont tram ran on the 17 March 1956, before being replaced by a bus route. In many places, the rails were simply paved over rather than being removed.
Power supply.
Current was provided at 500V by a generator in the depot at Montferrand. Originally, power was supplied by copper-covered overhead lines. Trams would attach via trolley pole to a sliding module on the underside of these copper lines. This system was similar to the one used by the Vevey–Montreux–Chillon–Villeneuve tramway since 1888. However, Claret introduced a new innovation to the Clermont system; the current was returned via the rails, rather than by a second overhead line.

Synopsis.
Season 1.
Machiko Mayuzumi (Yui Aragaki) is a bright up-and-coming lawyer who has a strong sense of justice and is passionate about protecting the meek. She starts her career defending a man who is charged with suspected murder and is being put under duress to confess to the crime. During the case, however, her boss Miki insists that Mayuzumi gets the suspect cleared of the charges, but Mayuzumi is unable to do so. However, Miki's secretary Kimie Sawachi informs Mayuzumi that there is a lawyer who has won every case so far in his career who could possibly help. With the will to succeed, Mayuzumi goes on a hunt to find the man. He is eventually found by Mayuzumi and is revealed to be Kensuke Komikado (Masato Sakai), a shallow man whose only desires are money, women and prestige. Despite all of his flaws, Mayuzumi is determined to win the case and asks Komikado if he can assist her in representing the defendant.

Owencam

Owencam () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Owencam is bounded on the north by Altateskin, Altcrock and Tullyloughfin townlands, on the west by Gowlan and Tullynaconspod townlands, on the south by Corrachomera townland and on the east by Tullybrack townland.

Owencam is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 316 statute acres. The sub-divisions of the townland are Cahran (Caothran = The Rowan Tree); Black Park; Pulbraddagh (Poll Braddach = Dangerous Quagmire).
History.
In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land.
A lease dated 17 September 1816 John Enery of Bawnboy includes "Owemcam".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1826 list eight tithepayers in the townland
The Ordnance Survey Name Books for 1836 give the following description of the townland- "There is a large mountain stream runs through the centre of the townland, on the north bank of which there are several good houses. Limestone can be procured in the bed of the large stream."
The Owencam Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 101, being 51 males and 50 females. There were fourteen houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 83, being 37 males and 46 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were fourteen houses in the townland, all inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists sixteen landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 86, being 40 males and 46 females. There were seventeen houses in the townland and all were inhabited apart from one in the course of erection.
In 1871 the population of the townland was 81, being 35 males and 46 females. There were eighteen houses in the townland, one of which was uninhabited.(page 296 of census)

Genghis Khan (unfinished film)

Genghis Khan (also known as Genghis Khan: The Story of a Lifetime) is an unfinished 1992 biographical film of Genghis Khan, starring Richard Tyson, Charlton Heston, Pat Morita and John Saxon. An unsuccessful attempt was made to revive the production in January 2010 and to release the film as "Genghis Khan: The Story of a Lifetime" as both a two hour feature film and six hour television series.
Plot.
Set in the 12th and 13th centuries, the movie tells the life story of Temudjin (1162–1227) who was later bestowed the title “the Genghis Khan” and became the most powerful emperor of Mongolia.
Cast.
The cast includes:
Production.
The film began shooting in Kyrgyzstan in 1991, which was still part of the Soviet Union at that time. During the production process the producers were concerned about the material filmed so far, and developed a new screenplay which included new material on Khan’s childhood. They also replaced original director Tolomush Okeyev with Peter Duffell, who left the project shortly afterwards and was replaced by Ken Annakin. 
By the time the majority of filming was completed, however, the Soviet Union had started to collapse, and the cast and crew were recalled to their respective embassies. 
Post production was therefore unable to be completed until January 2010, when Madison Motion Pictures Group purchased the rights to the original footage, with the intention of releasing the film sometime in 2010, as both a two hour feature film and six hour television series under the title "Genghis Khan: The Story of a Lifetime", and both director Ken Annakin and first unit director Antonio Margheriti were to be credited as co directors.

Studiolo of Isabella d'Este

The Studiolo of Isabella d'Este was a special private study in the Corte Vecchi apartments in the Ducal Palace in Mantua, designed by, and with a collection of art specially commissioned by Isabella d'Este. The Studiolo was moved between 1519 and 1522 to the castello di San Giorgio.
History.
Beginnings.
Born in Ferrara and educated by some of the most notable humanists of the era, the sixteen-year-old Isabella arrived in Mantua on 12 February 1490 to marry Francesco II Gonzaga. She was given apartments on the main floor of the castello di San Giorgio, close to the Camera degli Sposi. Shortly after her arrival she selected two rooms in these apartments for private use. Badly-lit and with no fireplaces, these two rooms were in the San Niccolò tower - the upper one became her "studiolo" and beneath it her barrel-vaulted "grotta", accessed via a staircase and doorway decorated in marble. She was probably inspired by the Studiolo of the Palazzo Belfiore, designed for her uncle Leonello d'Este, and those in Urbino and Gubbio, both of which she could have got to know via her sister-in-law and close friend Elisabetta Gonzaga, wife of Guidobaldo da Montefeltro.
Isabella used the studiolo for leisure pursuits, writing, study and correspondence as well as for displaying the highlights of her collections, initially only archaeological items but latter moving to contrast modern artworks with ancient ones. She loved music, poetry and art and was nicknamed the "tenth Muse". There were also several images of the muses in Mantegna's paintings for the studiolo and on the doorway into the grotta, which contained her antiquities. From 1492 she commissioned a series of allegorical, mythological and literary paintings for the studiolo from the most notable painters of the era, along with others praising the Este and Gonzaga families. She began in 1497 with Mantegna's 1497 "Parnassus", followed in 1499-1502 by his "Triumph of the Virtues". He also painted two "trompe-l'œil" bronze reliefs for the scheme, recorded in 1542 but now lost.
Next came works by other artists such as Perugino's "The Battle Between Love and Chastity" (a literary subject) and Lorenzo Costa's "Allegory of Isabella d'Este's Coronation" and "Reign of Comus". "Comus" was produced from an incomplete drawing left by Mantegna, who had died in 1506. Suggestions for the subjects came from her advisors, especially Paride da Ceresara. Her plan was to make the painters compete on identically-sized canvases, all with the same light source of the room's natural light and with foreground figures of the same size. Much correspondence between Isabella and Perugino survives, showing the difficult working process. He produced his work in Florence, but Isabella dictated its every detail via a drawing and even in the contract commissioning the work. Perugino was allowed to omit minor details but was absolutely banned from adding figures of his own invention or changing the brief. She continually sent her agents to check on his progress and when Perugino include a nude Venus rather than the clothed one she had specified in the brief, they reported back to her and she protested to the artist. Even when the painting was delivered in 1505, she said she would rather have had it done in oils, despite having specified tempera in the brief to match with Mantegna's style. The payment for Perugino's painting was only 100 ducats.
Paintings for the Studiolo.
Many of the artists were working in other cities and sending their work to Mantua and so the different systems of measurement across the Italian city states made it difficult to make this plan work. At least once Isabella wrongly stated the light direction to the artists working for her and she often sent changed her mind about the subjects and compositions. Not all the artists were familiar with the mythological and allegorical themes she commissioned and many were put off by the work being shown alongside that of Mantegna, who began the series of paintings - for example, Giovanni Bellini was asked to produce a work and left free to choose his own subject, but he eventually declined the commission as he was not used to working to such a detailed brief. Isabella also tried and failed to commission paintings from Giorgione (who died too soon to accept her offer) and Leonardo da Vinci (despite repeated requests). Botticelli was available but on the advice of Gian Cristoforo Romano and Lorenzo da Pavia Isabella refused him in favour of Perugino.
The two rooms became a must-see for dignitaries visiting the city, although many of the objects shown there were small and at risk of theft - after Charles III of Bourbon-Montpensier's entourage visited in 1509 it was found that some of the silverware had gone missing.
Second phase.
Between 1519 and 1522, after her husband's death, Isabella moved into new rooms on the ground floor of the so-called "Corte Vecchia", built by the ducal architect and "Prefect of the Gonzaga Buildings" Battista Covo. She dismantled the studiolo and moved it to these new rooms, which also included a "Nuova Grotta" or 'new Grotto', directly linked to the new studiolo. The rooms also included a 'secret garden', completed in 1522 and decorated with Ionic columns. The studiolo was paved with polychrome tiles from the workshop of Antonio Fedeli of Pesaro, originally bought by Francesco II Gonzaga for his residence at Marmirolo - once he had used those he needed, he sold the surplus to his wife to help her keep down the mice in her apartments.
She had the sculptor Tullio Lombardo create her a new marble doorway from the studiolo to the grotto between 1522 and 1524. She also commissioned a new doorway for the entrance to the Studiolo from Gian Cristoforo Romano, with four bas reliefs, tondoes and multicoloured marble. The grotto itself contained wood-inlay panels from the earlier studiolo, produced in 1506 by Paolo and Antonio della Mola. In 1531 she added "Allegory of Virtue" and "Allegory of Vice", both by Correggio, to the paintings in her studiolo. A 1542 inventory survives, giving some idea of how the paintings and objects were finally displayed on principals of harmony and symmetry but in a very high-density arrangement.
Dispersal.
After Isabella's death the studiolo fell into disuse and in 1605 its paintings were moved to another part of the palace. Around 1627 Charles I of Nevers gave them to cardinal Richelieu, who took them to Paris and added them to Louis XIV's collection. After the French Revolution they thus entered the collection of the Louvre Museum. The other furnishings were sold off and are now split between several different museums. The pavement tiles were lifted and sold off separately and are now in several Italian and foreign museums, including the applied art collections at the Castello Sforzesco, the , the Museo Bardini in Florence and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London
Collections.
Sculpture.
She had a great passion for collecting ancient sculpture, limited only by her lack of money and the papal ban on exporting such sculptures from Rome. However, thanks to help from the knight of Malta Fra Sabba da Castiglione, she was able to acquire original ancient Greek sculptures from Nasso and Rodi and fragments of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. A sarcophagus relief showing Hermes looking for Proserpina in Hades was built into the wall under the window of the studiolo.
She paid art agents in the main Italian cities through whom she heard of opportunities for improving her collection. One of these was the sale of Michele Vianello's collections in Venice in 1506, at which she bought a late-antique onyx vase. She also acquired some alabaster heads looted from the palazzo Bentivoglio in Bologna, despite knowing their provenance. She forced Mantegna to sell her an ancient Roman bust of a woman in 1498 since it was said to resemble her and later, when he was old and sick, forced him to give her his favourite bust of Faustina the Elder in return for paying off his debts. When she heard that Gian Galeazzo Sforza was about to die and had left her part of his collection, she sent emissaries to Milan even before his death to safeguard the relevant artworks.
Her modern artworks included Michelangelo's "Cupid", of which she was particularly fond. It had been suggested to her as a possible purchase in 1496 - she initially declined it as only an imitation of an ancient work of art, but on learning it was by Michelangelo keenly sought to acquire it. It was then owned by the Montefeltro family of Urbino, but when Cesare Borgia overthrow them she acquired it from him. When the Montefeltro family was restored to power she refused to return it to them, despite being related to them. It was displayed beside an ancient sculpture of Cupid attributed to Praxiteles, inviting comparisons between modern and ancient sculpture. She acquired small bronzes by Pier Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi reproducing some of the famous statues of antiquity - one of these, "Hercules and Antaeus", is now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Her ancient sculptures also included busts, agate and jasper vases and bas reliefs.
Other.
Isabella's collection also included medals, cameos (such as the noted Gonzaga Cameo), gems, classical coins, wooden-inlay panels and curiosities such as gilded cages, clocks and a 'unicorn's horn'. It also included objects she kept for sentimental reasons, such as a beechwood cabinet made by her brother Alfonso II d'Este in his spare time.

Castello di San Giorgio, Mantua

The Castello di San Giorgio is part of the Ducal palace of Mantua. It is a moated rectangular castle, each of which's four corners has a large tower and the moat is crossed by three drawbridges. 
History.
It was built between 1395 and 1406 on the ruins of the church of Santa Maria di Capo di Bove for Francesco I Gonzaga, to designs by Bartolino da Novara. Ludovico III Gonzaga gave over his rooms in the "Corte Vecchi" to pope Pius II for the Council of Mantua in 1459 - that year, he commissioned Luca Fancelli to rebuild the castle as a palazzo rather than as a defensible castle. He also commissioned the frescoes of the castle's Camera degli Sposi. In 1490 the castle became the site of the studiolo of Isabella d'Este, remaining there until she moved it to the "Corte Vecchi" in 1519-1522. In 1496 the condottiero Paolo Vitelli was captured by Francesco II and imprisoned in the castle. It remained the main Gonzaga residence for around a century until Guglielmo Gonzaga moved his apartments to the rebuilt "Corte Vecchi". 
In 1810 the Tyrolean fighter Andreas Hofer was imprisoned in the castle before his execution by the Kingdom of Italy. Mantua became part of the Austrian Empire in 1814 and from 1815 it was a maximum security prison for the Empire's political opponents, such as the Belfiore martyrs from 1852 onwards. Others pro-Risorgimento figures imprisoned there included Ciro Menotti and Teresa Arrivabene. The building's structure was damaged by the 2012 Emilia earthquake.

BioSimGrid was a project to make data sets from computer simulations in the field of modelling biological systems, particularly biomolecular structures, more accessible to researchers. The project began in 2004 and halted by 2009.
In 2004 designers presented the concept of the project as a "protein data bank extended in time". Other developers presented a web portal for accessing data in the project. Other designers described the project as efficient.
A review in 2006 described how BioSimGrid was a model project for making data from research more open.
BioSimGrid contributors accepted a grant from the National Institutes of Health in 2007.

Partisans (PUWP fraction)

Partisans - an informal group in the Polish United Workers' Party. It was created in the 1960s, its main creators were Mieczysław Moczar and General Grzegorz Korczyński. The name comes from the Nazi occupation history of Moczar and Korczyński, when they commanded partisan troops and refers to the veteran ethos.
Establishment of the fraction.
Mieczysław Moczar, as Deputy Minister and then Minister of the Interior, brought together a group of middle- and lower-tier state and party activists as well as former soldiers of the People's Army. Moczar and Korczyński also started to bring together young activists, mainly nationalist-oriented, deprived of opportunities for promotion as a result of blocking positions by the older generation. Those who did not participate in the fight against the German occupying forces due to their young age were called "patriots". Moczar also used the Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy to pursue his own goals, of which he was president since September 1964. Over time they gained support of members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Zenon Kliszka and Ryszard Strzelecki. Grzegorz Korczyński, Franciszek Szlachcic, Teodor Kufel, Jan Czapla, Mieczysław Róg-Świostek, Tadeusz Pietrzak, Colonel Marian Janic and others were associated with the fraction of partisans. At some point, the faction was also supported by then chief of the General Staff of the Polish Army, General Wojciech Jaruzelski.
Ideology.
The "Partisans" preached a specific veteran ethos with elements of extreme nationalism (chauvinism). This chauvinism was directed mainly against Germans, Ukrainians, then also against Jews, following the course of the "natolinians", who were attributed a decisive role in Stalinist repression in Poland. In a more secretive manner they also directed their hostility towards the Soviets, opposing the communist partisan fighters to those who came to Poland with the Soviet army (in "greatcoats"). The faction presented itself as Communist nationalists.
The basis for the ideology of "partisans" was provided by numerous publications concerning the fights conducted by communist partisans, especially "Barwy Walki" by Moczar himself.
Goals of the fraction.
Officially, "partisans" proclaimed loyalty to Władysław Gomułka, while in unofficial contacts suggested replacing him with someone more energetic and younger.
In fact, the objective pursued was to increase influence in the Polish United Workers' Party, which was combined with the desire to remove the older generation of activists, often of Jewish origin, from their positions. For this purpose, anti-Semitism and postulates of fight against cosmopolitanism, contrasted with patriotism, were used. The support from people of Jewish origin for Israel during the Six-Day War in 1967 and the participation of children of some opposition activists in the student protests were exaggerated to this end. The actions of the "partisans" were directed mainly against the remains of the "Puławianie" group. It is not entirely clear whether the "partisans" were planning to overthrow Gomułka or whether they wanted to secure Moczar's position as a second person in the party.
The climax of the role of "partisans" was constituted by anti-Semitic purges in the party and state institutions after March 1968.

2024 Russian presidential election

Presidential elections are scheduled to be held in Russia in March 2024. In accordance with electoral law, the first round will be held on Sunday, 17 March. The elections will be the first after the 2020 constitutional reforms.
If no candidate receives more than half the vote, a second round will take place exactly three weeks later on 7 April 2024. Incumbent President Vladimir Putin has the right to seek re-election. Despite the two-term limit, Putin has been granted the right to run again for two more terms, after the 2020 constitutional reform. The winner of the election is scheduled to be inaugurated on 7 May 2024.
As was the case in the 2018 presidential election, one of the most prominent opposition leaders, Alexei Navalny, is barred from running due to a prior criminal conviction, which is widely seen as politically motivated.
Background.
2020 constitutional reform.
According to clause 3 of article 81 of the Constitution of Russia, the same person cannot hold the position of President of the Russian Federation for more than two terms. The constitutional reform confirmed this provision, and even removed the words "in a row", because there was actually no limit on the maximum number of terms and thanks to which Vladimir Putin again became President in 2012. However, at the same time, the number of terms previously held by the incumbent and former presidents has ceased to be taken into account, which is why Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev received the right to be elected again for two new terms.
New requirements for candidates.
According to the new version of the Constitution, presidential candidates must:
Individuals who have publicly expressed interest.
Individuals in this section have expressed an interest in running for president.
Potential candidates.
Individuals in this section are the subject of speculation about their possible candidacy.
Declined to be candidates.
The individuals in this section have publicly denied interest in running.
Disqualified candidates.
This section contains candidates who expressed their intention to run or the most well-known potential candidates who have lost their right to run.

Aporophobia

Aporophobia (from the Spanish "aporofobia", and this from the Ancient Greek ἄπορος ("áporos"), 'without resources, indigent, poor,' and φόβος ("phobos"), 'fear') is fear of poverty and of poor people. It is the disgust and hostility toward poor people, those without resources or who are helpless.
The concept of aporophobia was coined in the 1990s by the philosopher Adela Cortina, professor of Ethics and Political Philosophy at the University of Valencia, to differentiate this attitude from xenophobia, which only refers to the rejection of foreigners, and racism, which is discrimination by ethnic groups. The difference between aporophobia and xenophobia or racism is that socially there is no discrimination or marginalization of immigrants or members of other ethnic groups when these people have assets, economic resources and/or social and media relevance.
After a decision of French Parliament on the 24 of June of 2016 it was added in the list of discriminations that forbidden by the constitution "discrimination for social precarity". 
However it noted that less than 20 persons instigated a lawsuit due to a such discrimination.

Sag ja zu mir, wenn alles nein sagt

"Sag ja zu mir, wenn alles nein sagt" (Say yes to me when all say no) is Christian hymn, with lyrics written by Diethard Zils in 1971, and music by made a hymn of the genre Neues Geistliches Lied with a melody by Ignace de Sutter. It is a penitential song, which appeared in the Catholic hymnal "Gotteslob of 1975". In the 2013 version, it appears only in regional sections.
History.
"Sag ja zu mir, wenn alles nein sagt" was written by Diethard Zils in 1971, in five stanzas, with verses of four lines which rhyme and a refrain which is a biblical quotation. It is a penitential song, taking as a starting point reflection of mistakes and rejection by many, but the hope that God who is addressed will accept and forgive. The refrain requests to open the mouth of the singer for praise ("Tu meinen Mund auf, dich zu loben"), and to give a new spirit ("und gib mir einen neuen Geist"). The hymn appeared in the first common Catholic hymnal in German, the "Gotteslob" of 1975. It was recommended as a "Psalmlied", a hymn suitable to be sung instead of a psalm between the first and second reading in the liturgy, although it is no paraphrase of a specific psalm. In the 2013 version of the hymnal, the hymn appears only in regional sections, such as the Diocese of Limburg, which has it as GL 767 in the section "Österliche Bußzeit (Fastenzeit)", which translates to: Time of penitence before Easter (Lent). The song is part of several songbooks.
Zils set his text to a melody which Ignace de Sutter had composed in 1959. The melody in C minor moves in even flow, beginning on C in low register, highlighting "nein (no) by a longer note, while otherwise only the last syllable of a line is held longer. The refrain is reminiscent of psalm recitation, using only three pitches around G, until it rises when the new spirit is mentioned, and ends an octave higher than the beginning.

Parathelphusa pantherina

Parathelphusa pantherina, commonly known as the "panther crab", is a variety of freshwater crab from Indonesia from the family of the Gecarcinucidae . The scientific name of the species was published for the first time in 1902 by Schenkel. The species is categorized as Endangered by IUCN Red List due to damage to their habitat by mining of nickel from lake shores where they live, which negatively impacts their water quality.
The species is bought and sold by aquarium hobbyists.
Ecology.
The species can be found in the indonesian island of Sulawesi, specifically Lake Matano and areas south of the lake. Common to the lake as one of its five native freshwater crab species but exclusive to the island as a natural habitat, they can be found hiding under roots and logs. They reproduce by eggs, and can be found only in freshwater environments. A typical pH of Lake Matano, their home, is 7.4, while temperatures range between 27 and 31 degrees Celsius (approximately 80–88 degrees Fahrenheit).
Description.
The natural coloration of this crab is yellow to light orange, with dark-red rosettes extending from their flat carapace to the ambulatory legs. Often, they have red-tipped claws and legs, but may also show no red coloration.

Kir Nesis

Kir Nazimovich Nesis (9 January 1934 – 8 January 2003) was a Russian marine biologist and malacologist, specialising in cephalopods.
Early life and education.
Nesis was born in Moscow on 9 January 1934 to an intellectual family, his father was an architect and his mother was an economic geographer. His father was arrested by the Soviet state in 1938 and executed. This would cause some difficulty for Nesis as he was the son of a person who had been executed as an enemy of the state. He initially wanted to study astronomy and he won an All-Union Competition in astronomy for schoolchildren but this career was not open to the son of an "enemy of the nation". He decided instead to become a marine biologist and in 1951 he enrolled in a course at the Moscow Technical Institute for Fisheries and Fishery Management in the Department of Hydrobiology, as this was not among the top ranked Soviet institutions his father's status did not bar him from entry.
Career.
After graduation Nesis was secured an appointment as a Junior Researcher at the Laboratory of Marine Biology in the Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography in Murmansk. His first spell at the Laboratory lasted from 1956 to 1960 and he returned from 1963-1966. He eventually became the Chief of the Laboratory and carried our research on the benthic fauna of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, especially the taxonomy and ecology of various groups of these animals. Between these tow periods in Murmansk Nesis enrolled at the Zoological Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences in Leningrad. Here he completed his Ph.D. and his thesis was called "“The Bottom Fauna of Commercial Fishery Areas of the North Atlantic and the Atlantic sector of the Arctic as an Indicator of Productivity and Water Regime”".
In 1966 he returned to Moscow where h briefly held a position with the Scientific Council on Hydrobiology and Ichthyology before moving to the P.P. Shirshov Institute of Oceanology of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Nesis worked here for the rest of his life in the Department of Nekton first as the Senior Scientist, then as the Principal Scientist and finally as the Leading Scientist. From the mid-1960s, the main focus of his research was on the taxonomy, zoogeography, ecology and evolution of cephalopods. In 1986, he was awarded a Doctor of Science degree for his book "“Oceanic Cephalopods: Distribution, Ecology, and Evolution”".
Nesis had come to be regarded as one of the world's foremost cephalopod workers by the mid 1970s and he was very prolific publishing around 460 scientific and popular publications and reviews, these included 6 books and 225 scientific papers on benthic ecology, cephalopod biology, marine zoogeography, ecology and evolutionary theory. He was the author of 43 papers about the ecology of bottom fauna. From this body of work some 274 publications, including all six of his books, 142 scientific papers and 45 popular science articles, were about cephalopods. He described 29 new cephalopod taxa, which included one new family. Nesis was also a productive free-lance author, writing circa 125 popular articles on biology for Soviet and Russian popular scientific publications. As well as that, he was the leading writer of biology abstracts for the Soviet/Russian Abstracts magazine of the Institute of Scientific Information writing at least 30,500 abstracts, averaging 70 a month. He also was Editor-in-Chief of "Ruthenica", the Russian Malacological Journal that he helped found and he sat on the editorial boards of several other scientific journals.
He was also an enthusiastic field biologist and he participated in over 30 research expeditions, both close to home in Russian waters and further afield in oceans around the world. Nearly 10 years of his life was spent at sea on expeditions, during which he collected and studied cephalopods and other animals as well as formulating new ideas. After each expedition he wrote an important contribution which advanced basic knowledge on the biology, taxonomy and faunal diversity of cephalopods of area studied during that voyage. The immense personal knowledge, his study of the many specimens collected on expeditions from around the world, and an extensive database of cephalopod literature enabled Nesis to write the world's first identification guide to the cephalopods. This book was first published in Russian in 1982 and was subsequently translated into English in 1987, was one of his principal accomplishments. He also authored a field guide to cephalopod larvae that covered 182 species. He was able to put his accumulated knowledge and experience into "“Oceanic Cephalopods: Distribution, Life Forms and Evolution”" which was published in 1985. This work in conjunction with his identification guides are still some of the main reference sources on the biology and identification of cephalopods.
He died suddenly in Moscow on 8 January 2003 on his way home from work. He was married to Tatiana Semenova, with whom he had a daughter, Anna.

Vitali Klitschko vs. Chris Byrd

Vitali Klitschko vs. Chris Byrd, was a professional boxing match contested on 1 April 2000 for the WBO Heavyweight Championship.
Background.
After knocking out Herbie Hide to win the WBO belt, Vitali Klitschko had made two stoppage defences against Ed Mahone, and Obed Sullivan. He was ranked 7th in the world by Ring magazine. He had planned to face Donovan Ruddock, however, he pulled out due to a hepatitis infection and Chris Byrd (who had been training for a bout with Lawrence Clay-Bey) stepped in at 10 days notice to take the fight.
The fight.
Klitschko controlled most of the fight with Byrd being elusive and making himself a difficult target. After 9 rounds Vitali had suffered a torn rotator cuff and despite being clearly ahead on the scorecards (88-83, 88-83, &amp; 89-82) he retired on his stool handing the win to Byrd. Harold Lederman, HBO's unofficial judge, had Klitschko ahead 88-83 at the time of the stoppage.
Aftermath.
Vitali's status as a rising star of the Heavyweight division took a knock after this with HBO commentator Larry Merchant said, "He doesn’t have the mentality of a champion. I can hardly believe what I just saw." Byrd's first defence in October was against the WBO's top contender, and Vitali younger brother Wladimir Klitschko, who avenged his brother loss with a clear decision victory.

Where the Water Tastes Like Wine

Where the Water Tastes Like Wine is an adventure game developed by Dim Bulb Games and Serenity Forge, and published by Good Shepherd Entertainment. It was released for Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows in February 2018. In November 2019, Serenity Forge announced that "Where the Water Tastes Like Wine" would also be released on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
Title.
"[Going] where the water tastes like wine" is an excerpt from the traditional American folk song "Going Down the Road Feeling Bad" (also known as the "Lonesome Road Blues").
Gameplay.
"Where the Water Tastes Like Wine" is a narrative-driven adventure game. Players explore a Great Depression-era United States, hearing and collecting oral stories and passing them along. Stories are used as a form of progression, with characters gradually opening up to the player in response to the provided stories, which in turn allows one to learn their true stories. The player may purchase goods to replenish their hunger or tiredness, with money being earned and then spent on the aforementioned goods, or in faster means of transportation. Several means of transport are available, including walking, hitchhiking and freighthopping.
Development and release.
"Where the Water Tastes Like Wine" was developed by Dim Bulb Games and Serenity Forge. The game was published by Good Shepherd Entertainment. The game was released for Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows on 28 February 2018. According to the developer, the game's initial release was a commercial disaster.
On November 8, Serenity Forge announced the game would be coming to the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on November 29.
Reception.
"Where the Water Tastes Like Wine" received "mixed or average" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. It was awarded the Developers Choice Award along with "Walden, a game" at the 2017 Indiecade Festival. However, in the months following release, creator Johnnemann Nordhagen wrote in his postmortem, "I can’t discuss exact numbers, but in the first few weeks fewer people bought the game than I have Twitter followers, and I don’t have a lot of Twitter followers," and "At the end of the day it’s astounding that a game that got this much attention from the press, that won awards, that had an all-star cast of writers and performers, that had a bizarre celebrity guest appearance [by the musician Sting] failed this hard." Nordhagen writes, "Basically, I’m not sure that games like this one can continue to be made in the current market."
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack of "Where the Water Tastes Like Wine" gained praise as an authentic representation of Americana: The 30-track compilation spans folk, jazz, country, blues, bluegrass, and more. The soundtrack was licensed and released by video game music label Materia Collective. A limited edition vinyl was pressed by Laced Records.

Weymouth Baptist Church

Weymouth Baptist Church is a Baptist Church in Weymouth, Dorset, England. It was built in 1813-14 by George Welsford as part of the terrace known as Bank Buildings, found at the southern end of Weymouth Esplanade. The church has been Grade II Listed since 1953, with the attached schoolroom being added to the listing in 1974.
History.
Weymouth's Baptist Church was built by George Welsford in 1813-14 and opened on 27 July 1814, with Rev. Dr. Ryland, Rev. Page and Rev. Saffery preaching over the course of the day.
The church was enlarged in 1828 with the addition of galleries. The original facade was styled in the form of two matching houses, but this was replaced in 1859 with a Doric facade. The schoolroom to the rear was built in 1864, while the church was re-pewed and re-lighted at the same time.
The chapel suffered extensive damage in 1889 after a fire ignited due to a defect in the building's heating apparatus. Further expansion of the church was seen in 1928 when the two adjoining houses were purchased, demolished and replaced with a brick building. The church stored Weymouth's archives during World War II.

<doc id="56748605" url="?curid=56748605" title="Hose bridge">
Hose bridge

A hose bridge can be used by tram operators to avoid delays by not being able to cross over fire hoses.
History, particularly in Chicago.
When until the end of the 19th century a fire occurred in the down town district of Chicago, near one of the loops of the Chicago Surface Lines, all the lines of the company using that loop were in danger of being tied up for a long period. Crossover switches were placed on the trunk lines before they came to the loops but this provision was inadequate for the large number of cars. The street car tracks were more often blockaded by the loose lines than from the burning building or any other cause.
The hose bridge used by the North Chicago Street Railroad Company for the trolley tracks resembled the bridges which were in service in many other cities. It consisted of a oak plank on either side bound with strap iron. Four semi-circular holes were cut to accommodate four lines of hose. Tie rods were spaced at intervals to hold the bridge to the proper gauge. The bridge was about over all and the inclines are such as to permit the cars to pass over it easily.
It has been a much more difficult problem to design a suitable bridge for the cable tracks. One, which has been perfected by Superintendent F. L. Fuller in 1898, used two tripods. The legs of the tripods were in length and consisted of tubing, into the interior of which was driven a wooden pole. The bridge proper was divided into two parts each . long. The floor was of plank and the rest of the bridge was constructed of light angle iron. The two halves fitted together and were held in place by two long pins.
The bridge ready to be sent to the fire was transported by a horse cart. As soon as it was taken to the scene of operation the two halves were laid across the tracks and pinned together. The lines of hose, any number less than nine, were placed in the bridge and a tripod set on each side of the tracks. A block and tackle was attached to an eye bolt in the apex of each tripod and the bridge with its load of hose was drawn up to the proper height. This whole operation could be performed by three men in less than eight minutes. The particular advantage of this bridge was that the lines of hose when filled with water could be lifted into place, which would have been a very difficult thing to do with almost any other form.
Two of these bridges were kept in a barn at the rear of the general offices. In the office was located a city fire alarm, and as soon as the gong sounds the location of the fire was determined. If the fire was a serious one, the wrecking wagon was sent to the barn and the bridges, which were suspended overhead, were let down into the wagon and quickly dispatched to the proper point. Although designed especially for cable cars the trolley cars passed under it by drawing down the trolley pole. As one fire was liable to blockade nearly all the cars of a system this bridge was estimated to save its cost many times over during one emergency.

The Henry C. Peak House, on Sparta Pike in Warsaw, Kentucky, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.
It was built in 1869 by Henry Clay Peak (1832-1913), a Confederate veteran of the Civil War.
It "is an example of the Gothic Revival style, embodying the cross-axis plan which appears to be unique to the Gallatin County area...the house exhibits a high degree of craftsmanship that makes it one of the best examples of this design in this region of northern Kentucky. The style combined with the plan (Gothic Revival, cross-axis) appears to be somewhat unusual for the regions outside northern Kentucky, but not uncommon however, in this particular area. The expertise and skill evident in the construction of this building makes it one of the superior examples of this design. The fine brickwork is one of the features of note. Also, the round arched hood molds on the second story windows are uncommonly well laid, with a deep but even profile."
It later served as the Warsaw Women's Club Building.

Career.
Svendsen became a lecturer at the University of Cambridge in 2013. Svendsen directed the interactive performance, "World Factory" at the Young Vic in 2015. From July 2016 to June 2017, she was part of the Future Scenarios networked residency programme- a project designed to imagine different futures under the auspices of climate change. From October 2017 to July 2018 Svendsen worked as an early career fellow at Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH), moving to Lent Term in 2018. In 2017, she was a resident at the Attenborough Centre of Creative Arts. She is an honorary research fellow at Birkbeck Centre for Contemporary Theatre.
Works.
We know not what we may be.
Svensden is currently working on an installation entitled WE KNOW NOT WHAT WE MAY BE which appeared at the Barbican in September 2018 as part of its Art of Change season. Over the last 2 years there has been a series of research in public conversations where Svendsen has interviewed a series of experts asking the questions: ‘What is the best possible economic structure for responding to climate change and what would it be like to live in this future system?’. The information and ideas gathered from these interviews formed part of the installation. WE KNOW NOT WHAT WE MAY BE was produced by Artsadmin.
World Factory.
World Factory is an interdisciplinary, interactive performance created by Zoe Svendsen and Simon Daw. The project explored global consumerism using the premise of the textile industry to illustrate the complex problems created by consumer demand. As part of their research for the performance, Svendsen and Daw travelled to China and commissioned the production of a shirt. They also interviewed Chinese factory workers whose testaments form part of the show. The show was first shown in 2015 at the Young Vic. It later toured in Brighton, Cambridge and Manchester. It formed part of the fabrications festival in 2017 at Brierfield Mills - produced by Artsadmin.
3rd Ring out: rehearsing the future.
This work was written and performed in 2010/2011 in several sites around the UK, including Edinburgh, Newcastle, Norwich, Ipswich and Greenwich. Svendsen set the scene in 2033, a small audience is invited into a converted orange shipping container where they assume the role of emergency planners. An ecological emergency - caused by global warming - unfolds in 'real time' and the audience has to take collective decisions, steered by an actor assuming the role of emergency commander.

Operation Serenata de Amor

Operation Serenata de Amor is an artificial intelligence project to analyze public spending in Brazil. The project has been funded by a recurrent financing campaign since September 7, 2016, and came in the wake of major scandals of misappropriation of public funds in Brazil, such as the Mensalão scandal and what was revealed in the Operation Car Wash investigations.
The analysis began with data from the National Congress and then expanded to other types of budget and other instances of government, such as the Federal Senate. The project is built through collaboration on GitHub and using a public group with more than 600 participants on Telegram.
The name "Serenata de Amor," which means "serenade of love," was taken from a popular cashew cream bonbon produced by Chocolates Garoto in Brazil.
Modules.
Throughout the development of the project new modules have been developed in addition to the main repository:
History.
Operation Serenata de Amor is an artificial intelligence project for the analysis of public expenditures. It was conceived in March 2016 by data scientist Irio Musskopf, sociologist Eduardo Cuducos and entrepreneur Felipe Cabral. The project was financed collectively in the Catarse platform, where it reached 131% of the collection goal paying 3 months of project development. Ana Schwendler, also a data scientist; Pedro Vilanova "Tonny", data journalist; Bruno Pazzim, software engineer; Filipe Linhares, a frontend engineer, Leandro Devegili, an entrepreneur and André Pinho took the first steps towards constructing the platform, such as collecting and structuring the first datasets.
Jessica Temporal, data scientist and Yasodara Córdova "Yaso", researcher; Tatiana Balachova "Russa", UX designer; joined the project after the financing took place.
The members created a recurring financing campaign, expanding the analysis of public spending to the Federal Senate. Donors make monthly payments ranging from 5 BRL to 200 BRL to maintain group activities. The monthly amount collected is around 10,000 BRL.
Results.
In January 2017, concluding the period financed by the initial campaign, the group carried out an investigation into the suspicious activities found by the data analysis system. 629 complaints were made to the Ombudsman's Office of the Chamber of Deputies, questioning expenses of 216 federal deputies. In addition, the Facebook project page has more than 25,000 followers, and users frequently cite the operation as a benchmark in transparency in the Brazilian government. One of the examples of results obtained by the operation is the case of the Deputy who had to return about 700 BRL to the House after his expenses were analyzed by the platform.
The platform was able to analyze more than 3 million notes, raising about 8,000 suspected cases in public spending. The community that supports the work of the team benefits from open source repositories, with licenses open for the collaboration. So much so that the two main data scientists of the project presented it at the CivicTechFest in Taipei, obtaining several mentions even in the international press. The technical leader presented the project in Poland during DevConf2017 in Kraków. It was also presented in the Google News Lab in 2017. It was presented by Yaso, when she was the Director of the initiative, at the MIT Media Lab/Berkman Klein Center Initiative for Artificial Intelligence ethics, and at the Artificial Intelligence and Inclusion Symposium, an initiative of the Global Network of Internet &amp; Society Centers (NoC). It was also presented both by Irio and Yaso at the Digital Harvard Kennedy School, over a lunch seminar, where the transparency of the platform and the main solutions found were discussed, so that the code and data are always available to verify its suitability.
This infographic provides information about the first results of Operation Serenata de Amor, a project that analyzes open data on public spending to find discrepancies.
The project was presented by Yaso to the House Audit and Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies in August 2017, and raised the interest of House officials who work with open data.
The operation has been a source of inspiration for other civic projects that aim to work with similar goals. Participation of several team members in events throughout Brazil and abroad can be found on the Internet, such as presentation at OpenDataDay, held at Calango Hackerspace in the Federal District, Campus Party Bahia, Campus Party Brasilia, Friends of Tomorrow, XIII National Meeting of Internal Control, in the event USP Talks Hackfest against corruption in João Pessoa, the latter being also highlighted in the National Press.

National Victory Celebration

The National Victory Celebration was held in Washington, D.C., United States, on June 8, 1991, to celebrate the conclusion of the Gulf War. It was the largest American military parade since World War II. 8,000 Desert Storm troops marched in the national parade. A small group of Vietnam veterans also took part in the parade. General Norman Schwarzkopf Jr., the commander of the Desert Storm forces, led the parade. The parade took place on Constitution Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, and across the Memorial Bridge. The elaborate parade, which cost $12 million, was criticized by opponents because they claimed it to be militaristic.
The celebration helped to set a single day Metrorail record of 786,358 trips, breaking the record of 604,089 trips set during the Inauguration of George H. W. Bush set in 1989. The record would last until the first inauguration of Bill Clinton in 1993. It also set the weekend record which would last 17 years until it was broken by the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear.

Peat Cutting Monday or Peat Cutting Day is a public holiday in the Falkland Islands that is celebrated on the first Monday in October every year.
Traditionally, Peat Cutting Day was the time of year when Falkland Islanders went out to cut cubes of surface-soil peat which was then used as the primary fuel for heating homes and cooking food in the islands. In 2002, the Executive Council of the Falkland Islands made it an official public holiday to be celebrated on the first Monday in October every year, replacing Falklands Day, which had been celebrated in August.
Little peat cutting takes place in modern times, with the Islanders instead using the day to go fishing and camping.

For 12 miles the railway, by a series of curves and only one switch-back, in the path of the electric motor, followed a grade running from 3.4 to 6.4 per cent. After reaching the top the rail road wound its serpentine course down on the other side to Klapperthall Park, passing on its way numberless other pleasure resorts and picnic grounds, through the scenery effected by the valley of the Schuylkill River.
The road began traffic during the summer of 1890; its equipment consisting of cars run by Edison No. 6, double reduction 15-horse- power street car motors. Since then, in view of the fact that the empty cars weigh 13 tons and often carry 100 passengers, all the new cars have two of the new 25-horse-power single reduction motors, which are giving excellent results. 
By 1891 there were in operation six long cars, each weighing about 13 tons. The cars used were of the Brill double truck pattern. Through the excellence of the motors and construction and the special oil boxes there was almost no noise. 
The power station was situated on the Schuylkill river, at the extreme end of the line. It consisted of two Edison 80-kilowatt generators, driven from counter shafting operated by two turbines. The weight of the cars, the type of rails, and character of the road bed, closely resembled a steam railway line, and indicated that the Edison General Electric Company did not intend to limit their operations to ordinary street car work, and encouraged the building of similar rail roads.

Villa Gruber De Mari

Villa Gruber De Mari was built by the noble Genoese family De Mari in the second half of the 16th century in the suburban area between the Sant'Anna and San Rocchino walkways linking the center of the city to the New Walls, in the Castelletto neighborhood of Genoa, Italy. The villa includes a 16th-century guard tower and the 17th-century former private chapel, now the Abbatial Church of Santa Maria della Sanità. The villa is located in a panoramic position within a large park, which has been opened to the public after the villa was acquired by the Municipality of Genoa in the 20th century.
History.
Built by the noble Genoese family De Mari in the second half of the 16th century, in 1664 the villa was the residence of the Doge of the Republic of Genoa Stefano De Mari ("Stêva De Mâri" in Ligurian language). The private chapel of Santa Maria della Sanità was added to the compound in the 17th century.
The building was modified several times. The current state was reached at the end of the 18th century, with the addition of the "Columns' Room" and the remake of the facade in the Neoclassical style. The facade is connected to the parc by two symmetrical stairways.
In 1856 the villa was sold to the Austrian businessman Adolf Gruber, who gave to the villa its current name. The Gruber family modified some internal features, but left the exterior untouched. At the beginning of the 20th century, an Art Nouveau annex was built in the garden. Around 1930, the villa was sold to a land developing firm called Perrone, which built a number of residential homes in the park. Later the villa and the remainder of the park were acquired by the Municipality of Genoa and have been destined to public fruition. For some years, the villa became the home of the Museo Americanistico Federico Lunardi, which has recently been relocated to the D'Albertis Castle nearby.
The villa is in poor state of conservation and is currently closed until renovation takes place. The park is well tended and remains open to the public. The Art Nouveau annex, also in poor state of conservation, is owned by the Carlo Felice Opera Theater. A lateral portion of the villa is still in use as the local station of the Military Police (Carabinieri).

Many of their works were never attributed to one sister or the other, but to "the Misses Allen." Many of their idyllic images harken back to an idealized version of the region's colonial history. In 1899, the Allen sisters joined Deerfield's Arts and Crafts Movement, and began to document the works of its earliest members. In 1907, Frances Allen was elected Director of the "Society of Deerfield Industries".

Vasilije Curcic

Vasilije Curcic (Vasilije Ćurčić; born October 11, 1991) is a Serbian professional basketball player who last played for the St. John's Edge of the National Basketball League of Canada (NBLC). He played five seasons of college basketball for the Memorial Sea-Hawks of Atlantic University Sport (AUS) in Canada, winning conference honors each year. A 6-foot-9, 235-pound power forward and native of Kragujevac, Serbia, Curcic attended high school at First Kragujevac Gymnasium. Vasilije has one son born in 2018 named Nelson Vincent.
Early life.
Curcic was born in the Serbian city of Kragujevac, where he attended First Kragujevac Gymnasium. In 2012, he took part in the postgraduate program at Luxembourg Basketball Academy (LBBA) for nine months. At LBBA, he helped draw attention from the Memorial University of Newfoundland, and on August 12, 2012, he committed to play with the Sea-Hawks under head coach Peter Benoite.
College career.
As a first-year member of the Memorial Sea-Hawks, on February 2, 2013, Curcic was tabbed as athlete of the week by "The Telegram" after recording a total of 49 points, 15 rebounds, and six assists in two games against St. Francis Xavier. He was named to the Atlantic University Sport (AUS) All-Rookie Team. For his next two seasons, Curcic was named second-team and then first-team AUS All-Star. He earned second-team honors in the following year. In 2016–17, Curcic was sidelined for much of the season because of injury but finished with second-team AUS All-Star accolades. By the end of his college career, after leading Memorial in scoring for all five seasons, Curcic was considered one of the best players in program history. He left Memorial as its third all-time leading scorer.
Professional career.
After graduating from Memorial, Curcic returned to Serbia to play professionally, but he was unable to find any satisfactory offers. On December 12, 2017, he signed with the St. John's Edge of the National Basketball League of Canada (NBLC). With the move, he reunited with Carl English, who he had trained with for several previous offseasons. On December 17, Curcic debuted for St. John's, with two points and one assist in nine minutes against the London Lightning. He recorded 11 points, seven rebounds, and two assists—all season-highs—in a win over the Niagara River Lions on January 21, 2018. Curcic was deactivated and released by the Edge on February 12, after he suffered a leg injury in practice.

After working as an illustrator, she worked as a product designer for clients like Urban Outfitters before spinning off her own self-titled apparel and accessory brand, Tuesday Bassen, and founding her store FriendMart.
Controversy.
On July 20, 2016, Bassen publicly accused the clothing retailer Zara of expressly copying designs from her brand without crediting her. First in an Instagram post, and then in several other publications, Bassen claimed that Zara had created several enamel pins which closely matched those designed by her brand, Tuesday Bassen. She then explained that after sending Zara a cease-and-desist letter, her complaint had been denied by the retailer. Zara then suspended the sale of all the items mentioned. However, Bassen's action caused many other artists to join in accusing Zara of violating their copyrights; Bassen then founded the website ShopArtTheft with another artist Adam J.

100th Anniversary of the Canadian Navy

100th Anniversary of the Canadian Navy is an outdoor memorial in Victoria, British Columbia. It was constructed to commemorate the founding of the Royal Canadian Navy and opened on the date of the navy's centenary. Its central feature is a bronze statue, sculpted by local artist Nathan Scott, entitled The Homecoming that depicts a Canadian sailor reuniting with his daughter upon his return from deployment. The monument also features memorials to individual Canadian vessels and sailors.
History.
The monument was erected on 4 May 2010 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Royal Canadian Navy via the "Naval Service Act" of 1910. It is intended as a marker of the nation's gratitude to the tens of thousands of sailors who have served with the force on more than 850 Canadian vessels since then. Local philanthropist and Honorary Navy Captain Cedric Steele was the driving force behind the project. His inspiration came from a statue in Halifax, Nova Scotia that commemorates the Navy's 75th anniversary. The site for the monument was donated by Greater Victoria Harbour Authority chairman Bill Wellburn.
The patron of the monument was Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia Steven Point who was supported by retired Vice-Admiral Nigel Brodeur and then-Commander of Maritime Forces Pacific Rear Admiral Tyrone Pile. It was funded through a fundraising campaign which included the sale of pewter small-scale copies of the statue and commemorative paving stones which surround the completed monument. The monument's unveiling was attended by the coastal defence vessel "Brandon" and navy veterans.
Description.
The monument is located on Wharf Street in Victoria, British Columbia. It comprises the bronze "Homecoming" statue set that depicts a sailor reuniting with his daughter (and dog) after returning from deployment; a stone marker describing the history of the Canadian Navy and the date of the monument's unveiling; and a second stone marker depicting the insignia of Navy veteran's associations, the names of individual supporters and the English translation of the Navy motto "Parati vero parati" ("Ready aye ready"). The central statue "The Homecoming" was sculpted by Nathan Scott, a local artist with a studio and foundry in Victoria.
The rear of both stone markers (on the side closest to "The Homecoming") depicts the fouled anchor insignia of the Royal Canadian Navy in bronze. The dark marble plinth of "Homecoming" has the name of the statue in gold lettering on one side and plaques mounted in memory of individual Canadian vessels on the other three, the plinth is surmounted by light-grey granite capping stones. The paved area surrounding the monument contains the commemorative stones engraved in memory of service men that were sold as part of its fundraising campaign. The stones continue to be sold and installed at the site to raise funds for the Esquimalt Military Family Resource Centre.

<doc id="56749563" url="?curid=56749563" title="Kampala Accord">
Kampala Accord

The Kampala Accord was an agreement made in Kampala, Uganda in line with the Transitional Federal Charter of the Somali Republic to bring and end to the transitional phase of the Transitional Federal Government on 20 August 2011. It was signed on 9 June 2011 by HE Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, President of the Transitional Federal Government, Hon Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden, Speaker of the Transitional Federal Parliament, H.E. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the Replublic of Uganda and Dr Augustine Mahiga, Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations. 
Prime Minister Mohamed Formajo's resignation.
One of the conditions of the Kampala Accord was that Prime Minister Mohamed Formajo would resign within 30 days. Announcement of Prime Minister Mohamed's proposed resignation was immediately met with protests in various cities. Thousands of civilians, many government soldiers, and some legislators marched through the streets of Mogadishu, calling for the dismissal of the President, the Parliament Speaker and the Parliament. The crowd also demanded that the Premier be reinstated and described Mohamed as the "only honest leader in recent years". 
Attacks on hotels in which members of parliament were staying and at least five deaths were also reported. Additional demonstrations against the Premier's resignation were held in Galkacyo, a key trading city in the north-central Mudug region, as well as in Belet Hawo in the far south.
In response, Prime Minister Formajo released a statement through the state-run Radio Mogadishu commending the armed forces for their rapid response and urging its troops to exercise restraint. He also appealed to the public to calm down, and indicated that "I have seen your expressions and heard your calls[...] You are part of the decision making — what you want must be heard." Additionally, in a press conference, the Premier called for the immediate release of all protestors who had been detained, and stated that his administration would launch an independent investigation into their arrest. Weighing in on the demonstrations, Mogadishu's Mayor Mohamed Nur suggested that "what [the demonstrators] have a problem with is that two people go and decide the fate of this government without considering the feelings of this population", and that putting the issue before Parliament for approval is a more democratic course of action.
On 11 June 2011, Prime Minister Mohamed released a statement indicating that the Kampala decision ought to be presented in Parliament for debate and appraised according to the laws stipulated in the national constitution. The Premier also stated that he would only step down if lawmakers voted to uphold the accord. This was echoed by the Cabinet, which indicated in a press release that, after having convened to discuss the Kampala decision, the Ministers agreed that the accord must be put before Parliament for evaluation. In addition, over 200 parliamentarians reportedly sought to urge the Prime Minister to reconvene Parliament so as to deliberate the decision, indicating in a separate statement that the accord deprived MPs of their legislative role vis-a-vis the government.
On 12 June 2011, President Sharif Ahmed released a statement wherein he condemned the protests, describing them as "illegal". He also suggested that some government officials were financing the rallies in Mogadishu, and warned that the Al-Shabaab group of Islamists that is waging war against the federal government could try to exploit the gatherings to launch terrorist attacks.
In an interview on 16 June 2011, Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Alfredo Mantica, expressed support for Prime Minister Mohamed's position with regard to the Kampala agreement. Mantica stated that the Italian government believed that the accord ought to be reviewed in Parliament. He also indicated that "the prime minister has been in office five months. And [it is too] early to judge his work. But what he has done so far has been very positive. It has achieved important results. The government already seemed a miracle[...] The strength of the instability in Somalia is a constant. And the prime minister represents stability."
On 19 June 2011, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed resigned from his position as Prime Minister of Somalia. Part of the controversial Kampala Accord's conditions, the agreement would also see the mandates of the President, the Parliament Speaker and Deputies extended until August 2012, after which point new elections are to be organized. In his farewell speech, Prime Minister Mohamed indicated that he was stepping down in "the interest of the Somali people and the current situation in Somalia". He also thanked his Cabinet for its efforts in improving the security situation and the standards of governance in the country.
Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, Mohamed's former Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, was appointed as Acting Premier later the same day. A few days later, on 23 June 2011, Ali was named permanent prime minister.
Prime Minister Mohamed's resignation was immediately met with anger by the general public and many lawmakers. Apprehension regarding a possible resurgence of governmental corruption and lassitude, long-standing problems which Mohamed's administration had made significant strides toward eradicating, were cited as primary reasons for the consternation. According to one legislator, many policy-makers are trying to repeal the Kampala decision, as it also "subject[s] the country to trusteeship". Another MP indicated that "lawmakers are united in their opposition to the deal" and "will object [to] it until we throw it away".
Observers have suggested that Mohamed's resignation could offer militants an opportunity to capitalize on the situation and set back the territorial gains made by his administration in the ongoing insurgency in southern Somalia. They have also opined that firing the Premier would not resolve the long-standing power struggle between President Sharif Ahmed and Parliament Speaker Sharif Hassan, but may inadvertently exacerbate and prolong it. Additionally, political analysts have suggested that the Kampala agreement presents other potential long-term issues, such as facilitating intervention and meddling by neighboring countries, with the Ugandan government's role as the final arbiter, in particular, cited as problematic.
Responding to the Kampala decision, the Al-Shabaab insurgent group's head of policy and regions, Sheikh Hussein Ali Fidow, told reporters on 22 June 2011 that the accord ended in failure since it was "an example [of how] the country is managed by Uganda" and that "it is clear for the Somali people and the international community that [the] Kampala meeting [on] Somalia was aimed to coerce the Prime Minister Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed to step down". In addition, the spokesman suggested that Somalia's citizenry was aware of what was going on and that it did not recognize President Sharif Ahmed and the Parliament Speaker Sharif Hassan as legitimate governmental authorities. He also reiterated his group's call for Ugandan troops to withdraw from the country.
On 24 June 2011, lawmakers reaffirmed their opposition to and intention of repealing the Kampala decision. The Chairman of the federal Information, Public Awareness, Culture and Heritage Committee, Awad Ahmed Ashareh, indicated that 165 legislators had tendered a motion in Parliament opposing the agreement, but the Speaker rebuffed it. Ashareh also stated that MPs would issue a vote of no confidence vis-a-vis the Speaker Hassan if he continued to refuse to permit debate to take place, suggesting that Hassan's refusal "contravenes the Charter and rules of procedure".
Following talks with parliamentarians, President Sharif Ahmed asserted on 28 June 2011 that, on account of opposition amongst legislators to the Kampala decision, the accord would be brought before Parliament for deliberation. He also indicated that the agreement would not be implemented unless approved by lawmakers.

Paulasterias mcclaini

Paulasterias mcclaini is a species of starfish in the family Paulasteriidae. It is found in deep water at hydrothermal vents.
Taxonomy.
This species was collected by the marine biologist Craig McClain and first described by echinoderm specialist Christopher Mah in 2015, being named "Paulasterias mcclaini" in honour of its finder. Along with its sister species "Paulasterias tyleri", also found at hydrothermal vents, it differed markedly from other known starfish species, so the new family Paulasteriidae in the superorder Forcipulatacea was created to accommodate the two species. They are the first starfish species known from hydrothermal vents.
Description.
"P. mcclaini" is a six-armed starfish with slender tapering arms. Larger specimens have a thick fleshy skin on the aboral (upper) surface, with spongy tissue underneath, which conceals the dermal plates. It is a pink starfish, covered with short spines.
Distribution and habitat.
This starfish was found as part of the assemblage of animals forming a community on the seabed at a deep sea hydrothermal vent in the Northeast Pacific off the coast of Washington and Oregon. It is found on rock, lava flows, mud and even clay.
Ecology.
Starfish are unable to cope with the hot, sulphurous, toxic environment of the hydrothermal vent itself but they are present in the cooler, cleaner water nearby. Hoff crabs live adjacent to the hydrothermal vent chimneys, with gastropod molluscs and then goose barnacles occupying zones further out. Beyond this is an assemblage dominated by sea anemones, and it is on these and on the goose barnacles that the starfish probably feed.

The McNary Levee System, also known as the Tri-Cities Levees, is an appurtenant or dam-related structure to McNary Lock and Dam, and consists of three groups of levee segments along the banks of the Columbia River that provide flood risk reduction for portions of Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland, Washington. The levee group names are based on location and are identified as the Kennewick Levees, Pasco Levees, and Richland Levees. Lake Wallula behind McNary Lock and Dam is about 63 miles long and includes 242 miles of shoreline and a drainage area of 214,000 square miles. The McNary Levee System consists of about 16.8 miles of earthen levees and 11 operational pump plants that remove agricultural runoff, groundwater migration, and rainfall runoff. Construction of the McNary Levee System began in 1950 and was completed in 1954.

Seolhwa–Myeonggok station

Seolhwa-Myeonggok Station is a Line 1 underground station of the Daegu Metro in Dalseong County Daegu, South Korea. This station is a southern terminus of Line 1. The station was opened on September 8, 2016, by the opening of the west extension between Seolhwa–Myeonggok and Daegok.
Station name.
The "Sulwha Myeonggok Station" is a name that combines the two names of Sulwha-ri and Myeonggok-ri. In the case of Sulwha, there were many apricot trees growing in the village in the past. When spring comes, the apricot blossoms are like snowflakes, so they were called Sulwha. It was written as Seo (舌化), and it became the current narrative, and in the case of Myeonggok, the village was located in a valley and its shape was long and narrow like a home, so it was called Myeonggok.

Tosun (construction equipment)

Tosun is a remote controlled armored wheel loader developed in Turkey for combat engineering missions. It is manufactured by Best Group and is in use by the Turkish Army and Turkish Police.
History.
The armored wheel loader was developed by the Ankara-based defense company Best Group in cooperation with the heavy equipment manufacturer Çukurova Makina from Mersin in 2015. The need for such construction equipment arose when removing the barricades and filling up the trenches built in 2015 by militants linked to the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in some residential areas in southeastern Turkey, such as in Yüksekova, Hakkari, Nusaybin, Mardin, and Sur, Diyarbakır. Attacks of militants with rocket-propelled grenades to the loader operator during the operation led to the initially armored-only vehicle being developed as an unmanned, remote-controlled vehicle.
Description.
The remote control system features NLOS communication up to and LOS communication up to , all vehicle functions with a delay of up to 250 ms. Tosun has eight situational awareness camera systems, enabling the operation of the unmanned equipment in residential areas without direct sight.
As of the end of February 2018, there were a total of 85 Tosun in use. The vehicle can be operated remotely within a range of on open area at military cross-border operations. It is remotely operable within a range of in residential areas, where buildings are situated between the transmitter and the receiver. 
Use.
Tosun vehicles were used during the building of the Syria–Turkey barrier, the Operation Euphrates Shield, and Operation Idlib Shield. In the ongoing Operation Olive Branch, 43 Tosun vehicles are in use.
At the end of February 2018, it was reported that the United States and the United Arab Emirates showed interest in importing Tosun, which cost a sixth of that of similar vehicles deployed in the United States and Israel.

Mishaps of the New York–Paris Race

Mishaps of the New York–Paris Race () was a 1908 French silent comedy film directed by Georges Méliès. Inspired by the real 1908 New York to Paris Race, which concluded shortly before its release, the film followed a group of racers through a hectic series of unlikely obstacles and adventures across North America, Russia, and Western Europe in a highly unreliable race car. Film scholars have noted parallels to earlier Méliès films, including "The Impossible Voyage" and "An Adventurous Automobile Trip", and have commented on elements of racism in the scenario, but the film itself is currently presumed lost.
Plot.
In New York City, an automobile race to Paris is launched. A large crowd, including a Salvation Army brass band, sees off the six racecars, including a De Dion-Bouton driven by Georges Bourcier de Saint-Chaffray, a Motobloc, a steam automobile, and even a kitchen on wheels, where a black visitor is hurried out before the race begins. The cars speed over the precipices of the Rocky Mountains, where they navigate a rickety bridge over a torrent; though the De Dion-Bouton speeds easily over the bridge, it breaks under the weight of the next car, hurling it into the water. The other four cars, going too fast to be able to stop, follow it over the precipice. The De Dion-Bouton, now alone, continues its journey as far as the plains of California, where it suffers a breakdown just as it is being attacked by a group of Iroquois. The abducted travelers, about to be scalped, escape by getting their captors drunk on gasoline. They regain their car only to realize that, having used up their gasoline in the ruse, they cannot start the engine. Taking some feathered Iroquois headdresses to use as sails, they convert the automobile into a sail wagon and travel on the wind.
The weather gets worse, and a cyclone carries the car into the sky. It flies over Canada and finally makes a crash landing on a frozen Alaska river. Finding a horse to pull the car, they reach a gold mining camp. In welcome, the miners take them on a tour of a glittering mine and give them two boxes of gold. The travelers set off again with sled dogs pulling their car. They make it as far as the Bering Strait before the dogs are tired out and can go no further. An ice avalanche sends the car into the sea, where a whale accidentally swallows it. The whale spits out the car on an ice field, where the travelers see a pack of polar bears approaching. Just when an attack seems imminent, it becomes clear that the bears come in peace, thinking the fur-covered travelers are bears as well. Humans and bears exchange hearty handshakes and conversation, until they notice that the airship "Patrie" is being blown toward them by the strong wind. The travelers make a dash for the airship, managing to fasten one of its guide ropes to the car.
The airship carries the car to Siberia, where some poor serfs agree to pull the car over the ice. They pass through villages, where the travelers are greeted with welcome, vodka, and displays of ice skating. Reaching Germany, the travelers are still unable to make their car work, and call upon a caravan of Romani people to pull it onward for a while. At last, their car in shambles, carried along by a Paris coachman's nag, they reach the finish line at the Place de la Concorde, where the police chief Louis Lépine and the President of France have arrived to greet them. The travelers, distributing their souvenirs of the journey to the crowd, are carried in triumph through the streets of Paris.
Production and release.
Throughout his film career, from 1898's "Divers at Work on the Wreck of the "Maine"" to 1912's "The Conquest of the Pole", the pioneering filmmaker Georges Méliès drew freely on topical themes taken from current events; "Mishaps of the New York–Paris Race" is another example of this technique. The real-life 1908 New York to Paris Race, sponsored by "Le Matin" and "The New York Times", set off on February 12, 1908. George Schuster was declared the winner on July 30 upon his arrival in Paris; Georges Bourcier de Saint-Chaffray, the racer sponsored by Jules-Albert de Dion of the De Dion-Bouton company, left the race in Siberia when de Dion decided to stop funding him. In addition to featuring Bourcier de Saint-Chaffray as the main character of the film, Méliès's scenario also namedrops the airship "Patrie" and, back in Paris, Louis Lépine, the Préfet de Police for the Paris Police Prefecture.
One of Méliès's most successful films had been the 1905 comedy "An Adventurous Automobile Trip". He returned to the theme of a madcap automobile journey with "Mishaps of the New York–Paris Race". The plot of the film shows the influence of the earlier one, as well as of another successful Méliès film, "The Impossible Voyage" (1904). The film scholar Elizabeth Ezra, discussing the surviving scenario for the film, notes its racist overtones, citing the scene in which the kitchen-car is visited by a black man: "The very presence of an African is represented as one more 'mishap', a nuisance to be repelled". The real race used as Méliès's source returned to the screen in 1965, when it was adapted into the comedy "The Great Race". The film was made mostly in Méliès's glass-roofed studios in Montreuil-sous-Bois; the second, tenth, and twenty-sixth scenes (titled "Les couriers," "L'Alaska," and "La place de la Concorde" in advertising material) were shot just outside, in the garden of Méliès's property.
The film was released in July 1908 by Méliès's Star Film Company, and is numbered 1199–1217 in its catalogues. The film was advertised as being 380 meters long, which, at Méliès's preferred projection speed of 12 to 14 frames per second, is about 24 minutes. According to a 1912 film journal article, the film was included as an attraction in a 1908 Théâtre Marigny revue in Paris.
"Mishaps of the New York–Paris Race" is currently presumed lost.

Frankie Animal

Frankie Animal is an Estonian indie rock band formed in 2012.
In the year of their foundation, Frankie Animal participated in the Estonian Youth Band ("Noortebänd") competition, where they managed to win eight awards. In 2014 they released a debut EP "Obsession", which peaked in digital streaming platforms.
The band has performed at the Positivus Festival in Latvia, as well as in The Netherlands at Eurosonic Noorderslag. They were also the supporting act for Ewert and the Two Dragons during their 2015 tour in Germany.
In April 2016 Frankie Animal released their first full-length album "The Backbeat".
Frankie Animal participated in Eesti Laul 2018 with their entry "(Can't Keep Calling) Misty".
Musical career.
2012-2014: "Early years".
The band gave its first public concert in the autumn of 2012. On October 25, they entered the Youth Band competition, where they reached the finals but were the runner-up in the end. Frankie Animal still managed to win eight special awards, including Raadio 2's, leading alternative radio in Estonia, favourite and audience’s favourite. In December 2013 they started recording their first EP "Obsession", which was completed in collaboration with Ewert and The Two Dragons guitarist Erki Pärnoja. "There's both a rockier side and a softer, more melancholy side. Everything is balanced, the first half has more power and the other half is more peaceful with gloomy melodies," explained Marie, the vocalist. In 2014 the band had their first big concert at the Positivus Festival in Latvia. They also performed at Intsikurmu, an Estonian music festival. Frankie Animal's first singles were "My Friend" and "Loveless man".
2015: "Eurosonic Noorderslag".
2015 was a significant year for the band as they had the opportunity to perform at the Dutch festival Eurosonic Noorderslag, which is known as a place to discover new artists. In addition, they took part in Ewert and The Two Dragons tour in Germany, where they were the supporting act at five concerts. It was a big stepping stone for them, as the band had always said how Ewert and the Two Dragons really inspired them to start a band themselves.
2016: "The Backbeat".
In April, Frankie Animal's first full-length album "The Backbeat" was released. Kaspar Viilup (Estonian Public Broadcasting) said: "Marie Vaigla's vocals are remarkably versatile, at one point as fragile as Karen O's solo projects and the next moment screaming-roaring as The Kills' lead vocalist Alison Mosshart. The guitar parts are also praiseworthy - Jonas Kaarnamets is one of the most talented Estonian guitarists of the new era. Their music really sounds unexpectedly big - even the ballads at the end of the album are bright and heart-wrenching rather than pretentious and cold. So there is definitely no lack of emotionality on this record - something that is a big exception in younger generation rock music, because the macho-posture and the "I'm-so-cool" image just obscure it. Frankie Animal has completely gotten rid of it."
2017-2018: "Eesti Laul".
In 2017 the band released three singles: "Nightlights", "Pretty Late" and "(Can't Keep Calling) Misty". With the latter, they took part in the Eesti Laul 2018 contest, where the winner represents Estonia in the Eurovision Song Contest. Frankie Animal placed seventh in the competition, but gained public recognition in the process. In May they collaborated with Jüri Pootsmann and released a single "Funny".
2019-Present.
In June 2019, Frankie Animal released a new single "Playful" under the label "Made in Baltics" (Sony Music), which became the most played song by Raadio 2 in July 2019. On 1 May 2020 they released a single "Restless". "It seems to me that with "Playful" and "Restless" we have found the direction we want to move musically with the whole album. Slightly pop, nostalgic and a reflection of us three. I feel that the connection between us is also getting stronger and that makes the music more complete," says the band's guitarist Jonas Kaarnamets.

Pamela Rosenkranz

Pamela Rosenkranz (born 1979 in Altdorf, Uri, Switzerland) is a Swiss multimedia artist who uses light and liquid to demonstrate her concepts along with performance, sculpture, painting, and installation art. Her work explores ideas and concepts of what it means to be human, its ideologies, emptiness and meaninglessness, as well as globalization and consumerism. She is represented by Karma International, Zurich / Los Angeles; Miguel Abreu Gallery, New York; and Sprüth Magers Berlin, London and Los Angeles.
Education and Career.
Rosenkranz graduated from the University of Zurich in 2005, and received her MFA from the Academy of Fine Arts, Bern, in 2010. In 2012, she completed an independent residency at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam. Rosenkranz's aesthetic choices are often informed by her extensive research into fields ranging from marketing and medicine to philosophy and religion. Her use of use of glass, plastic water bottles, and liquid reflecting surfaces stems from her interest in physicality as evident in the 2015 exhibition "Open Source: Art at the Eclipse of Capitalism." Shiny, reflective surfaces provide a way for Rosenkranz's work to establish physicality, and interact with their environments. The biological and medical implications of light are of importance to the artist, as light affects the human body. Water as a medium connotes purity and detoxification, however, more accurately the plastic bottles that deliver water harbor bacteria and colonies of hormones.
Having collaborated with Robin Mackay and Reza Negarestani, Rosenkranz's work is often framed in relation to Speculative Realism. Her institutional solo exhibitions in Geneva, New York, and Braunschweig were covered in a 2012 monograph entitled "No Core".
Exhibitions.
While still a student at the Academy of Fine Arts, Bern, Rosenkranz participated in both the 5th Berlin Biennale and Manifesta 7, in Trentino, Italy. In 2010, the same year that she graduated with a master's degree, Rosenkranz exhibited solo at Centre d’Art Contemporain Geneve, and at Germany’s Kunstverein Braunschweig. 
Rosenkranz's first solo exhibition at Miguel Abreu Gallery in 2012, "Because They Try to Bore Holes," collapsed art into its material elements.
In 2015, Rosenkranz exhibited "Open Source: Art at the Eclipse of Capitalism." Later that year, she represented Switzerland at the Venice Biennale with an immersive installation of immaterial elements titled "Our Product". 
She exhibited "Slight Agitation 2/4: Pamela Rosenkranz" in 2017 at Fondazione Prada, Milan. 
In 2018, Rosenkranz debuted "Amazon Spirits (Green Blood)" at Karma International in Zurich to explore the intersection between the Amazonian rainforest and amazon.com, Inc.
In her 2019 exhibition "Evian Waters," Rosenkranz highlighted the chemical and natural components underlying notions of eternal youth and purity.

Angiotensin II (medication)

Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a medication that is used to treat hypotension resulting from septic shock or other distributive shock. It is a synthetic vasoconstrictor peptide that is identical to human hormone angiotensin II and is marketed under the brand name Giapreza. The Food and Drug Administration approved the use of angiotensin II in December 2017 to treat low blood pressure resulting from septic shock.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication.
Medical uses.
Angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor used to increase blood pressure in adults with septic or other distributive shock. Angiotensin II is a naturally occurring hormone secreted as part of the renin-angiotensin system that results in powerful systemic vasoconstriction. The vasopressor effects of angiotensin have been studied since it was first isolated in the late 1930s. Vasopressors are defined as agents that combat vasodilatory shock by inducing peripheral vasoconstriction. Commonly used vasopressors include catecholamine (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine) and non-catecholamine (e.g., vasopressin). 
but these agents are not always effective in reversing vasodilatory shock, and their use can be associated with significant side effects including limb ischemia and cardiac arrhythmia. Angiotensin II is as a treatment option that can increase blood pressure and allow catecholamine dose reductions. 
Angiotensin II must be administered as an intravenous infusion diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride prior to use. The recommended starting dosage of angiotensin II is 20 nanograms (ng)/kg/min via continuous intravenous infusion. Administration through a central venous line is recommended. Monitor blood pressure response and titrate angiotensin II every 5 minutes by increments of up to 15 ng/kg/min as needed to achieve or maintain target blood pressure.
Adverse effects.
Angiotensin II treated patients are at an increased risk of thromboembolic events. There was a higher incidence of arterial and venous thrombotic and thromboembolic events in patients who received angiotensin II compared to placebo treated patients in the ATHOS-3 study [13% (21/163 patients) vs. 5% (8/158 patients)]. It is recommended that patients be on concurrent venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Other adverse reactions include thrombocytopenia, tachycardia, fungal infection, delirium, acidosis, hyperglycemia, and peripheral ischemia.
Angiotensin II acts on Angiotensin receptor (AT1) on presynaptic adrenergic nerves → release of catecholamine → excessive catecholamine can be harmful as it can cause myocyte necrosis.
Interactions.
Angiotensin II receptor blockers, as their name implies, block the action of angiotensin II at its receptors and therefore may reduce its effects. ACE inhibitors, on the other hand, may increase its effects.

Manasota Key Offshore

The Manasota Key Offshore (8SO7030) is an archaeological site under of water in the Gulf of Mexico near the southwest coast of Florida. The site contains remains of multiple humans who were buried in a freshwater pond 7,200 years ago. The pond, which was about above sea level at the time, was subsequently covered by the waters of the Gulf as sea levels rose. The site is about from the coast of Manasota Key, near Venice, Florida.
The site was found in 2016 by a fossil hunter, who reported possible human remains. Archaeologists examined the site using non-intrusive methods, including magnetometry, sub-bottom profiling and side-scan sonar. The examination of the site revealed multiple burials in clusters. The burials were in what had been a layer of peat at the bottom of a freshwater pond. Wooden stakes were found associated with the burials. The peat had helped preserve the bones and the wooden stakes. Two of the stakes found at the site yielded radiocarbon dates of 7,200 years ago, early in the Archaic period in Florida. 
The burials at the Manasota Key Offshore site resemble those at the Windover Archeological Site, Little Salt Spring and other sites of the early Archaic period in Florida. The Manasota Key Offshore site is remarkable in its preservation even though it has been below sea level for close to 7,000 years.

Charmed (2018 TV series)

Charmed is an American fantasy drama television series developed by Jennie Snyder Urman, Jessica O'Toole, and Amy Rardin. It is a reboot of the WB series of the same name, created by Constance M. Burge, which originally aired from 1998 to 2006. "Charmed" premiered in the United States on October 14, 2018, on The CW. Carter Covington served as showrunner for the first season, before married duo Liz Kruger and Craig Shapiro took over for the second and third seasons. Jeffrey Lieber, Joey Falco, and Nicki Renna will replace Kruger and Shapiro as showrunners for the upcoming fourth season.
The first three seasons follow the lives of sisters Macy (Madeleine Mantock), Mel (Melonie Diaz) and Maggie (Sarah Jeffery), who, after the death of their mother, discover they are the Charmed Ones, the most powerful trio of good witches destined to protect both innocent lives and the world from demons and other dark forces. Each sister has an individual magical power, which is noticeably stronger when all three sisters work together as the "Power of Three" to defeat their enemies. The sisters are aided by a Whitelighter, Harry Greenwood (Rupert Evans), an advisor who protects and guides witches. 
The reboot is known for being more diverse than the original series by casting three women of color in the lead roles, and for its LGBT representation by making one of the sisters a lesbian. Urman explained that television viewers already "had a chance to see three white witches" on the original "Charmed", and that she was adamant on developing a different version of the series where people of color and the LGBT community could see themselves represented onscreen and "be the hero of the story". The reboot sparked controversy from some cast members and fans of the original "Charmed"; Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano both criticized The CW's decision to reboot the series without any involvement from the original cast or crew, while fans campaigned all over Twitter to stop the network from moving forward with the pilot episode.
The first season of "Charmed", which aired on Sundays, helped The CW return to original programming on Sunday nights for the first time since the 2008–09 U.S. television season. "Charmed" was renewed for an upcoming fourth season in February 2021, which will premiere as a mid-season replacement in 2022.
Premise.
The series begins in the fictional college town of Hilltowne, Michigan, where sisters Mel (Melonie Diaz) and Maggie Vera (Sarah Jeffery) are living with their mother Marisol (Valerie Cruz), who shortly afterward is attacked and killed by an unknown dark force. Three months later, Mel and Maggie discover that they have an older half-sister, Macy Vaughn (Madeleine Mantock), who was kept a secret by their mother for years but recently moved to Hilltowne for a new job at the local university the sisters attend. When Macy meets her sisters for the first time at the family's Vera Manor, lightning flashes and the house's power goes out, indicating the sisters' magical powers have been activated now that all three of them are together. Macy receives the power of telekinesis, middle sister Mel can freeze time, and Maggie, the youngest, can hear people's thoughts. Soon afterward, their Whitelighter—an advisor who protects and guides witches—Harry Greenwood (Rupert Evans) gathers all three sisters together in their attic; he reveals to the sisters that they are witches and presents them with their family's "Book of Shadows"a spell book and guide to using the "Power of Three". Marisol had bound her daughters' powers when they were each born to protect them and let them live normal lives but was in the process of unbinding their powers on the night she was murdered. By the end of the first episode, Macy moves into the Vera Manor and the sisters ultimately accept their new destiny as the Charmed Ones, the most powerful trio of good witches who protect both innocent lives and the world from demons and other dark forces.
The reboot changes several elements from the original "Charmed" series, including moving the fictional setting from San Francisco to Hilltowne; making the middle sister a lesbian; giving the youngest sister the power of telepathy instead of premonition; changing the family name from Halliwell to Vera; and having all three of the sisters' alliterative names begin with 'M' instead of 'P'. Additionally, the reboot has a more ethnically diverse cast: Mantock is Afro-Caribbean, Diaz is Puerto Rican, and Jeffery is African American, English and Indigenous Canadian. However, in the series they all play Latina sisters, with Mantock's Macy and Jeffery's Maggie both being Afro-Latinas. 
It was originally thought that Macy was the half-sister, until the tenth episode of the first season revealed that Macy and Maggie are full sisters, sharing the same father, and Mel is the real half-sister, sharing the same mother as Macy and Maggie but a different father.
Production.
Background and development.
A reboot of the original "Charmed" series had been announced since October 2013, when it was originally being developed for CBS by "Party of Five" co-creator Christopher Keyser and Sydney Sidner. The CBS reboot's pilot script was going to revolve "around four sisters who discover their destiny – to battle against the forces of evil using their witchcraft." However, CBS ultimately decided not to move forward with the reboot. On January 5, 2017, it was announced that The CW network was developing a new reboot of "Charmed" by "Jane the Virgin" showrunner Jennie Snyder Urman for the 2017–18 television season. Urman had been approached in 2016 by CBS Television Studios (who own the rights to "Charmed") to work on a new reboot of the show. Urman, knowing that "Jane the Virgin" writers Jessica O'Toole and Amy Rardin were fans of the original series, brought them on board with her along with director Brad Silberling. On why she wanted to reboot the series, Urman explained: "The original was so much about female empowerment and sisterhood and strong women taking over the world and I feel like that's what we need right now. It felt like a good time to get back to that and show women kicking ass." On the reason they chose not to revive the series with the original cast, O'Toole explained: "That show wrapped everything up so wonderfully — they all got their happy endings, and there were even glimpses of their future. We felt like it told a complete story." Urman added that they did not want to mess around with the original because it was eight years of mythology. The CW president Mark Pedowitz weighed in on why "Charmed" was better as a reboot than a revival, saying "We wanted to take a different path" with Urman's "great" perspective, calling the original series "a great show for that time and place" only.
The CW reboot's original pilot script was going to be a prequel set in 1976 about three witches (Tina, Paige and Annie), who are not related but are brought together to fight evil in a small New England town. O'Toole stated that the prequel would have "explicitly explore[d] the links between the feminist movement and witchcraft." At the time, Pedowitz described the reboot as "a self-contained, self-sustained" and "very standalone show" that would not have any ties to the original series. However, on February 3, 2017, "The Hollywood Reporter" announced that the reboot would be redeveloped and delayed until the 2018–19 television season, as the pilot draft script "didn't come in the way the network had hoped" and that Urman, who had prior commitments with "Jane the Virgin", did not have enough time to fully commit to the reboot for the 2017–18 season. Pedowitz gave an update on the reboot during the Television Critics Association press tour in August 2017, saying that it was still in the redevelopment process and that the network was waiting to see what Urman had come up with for the redeveloped script.
On January 25, 2018, The CW officially ordered the "Charmed" reboot to pilot. The redeveloped script was changed to be set in the present day and was described by The CW as "a fierce, funny, feminist reboot" centered on "three sisters in a college town who, after the tragic death of their mother, are stunned to discover they are witches." The description also stated that the reboot would revolve around the sisters "vanquishing supernatural demons" and "tearing down the patriarchy," while "maintaining familial bonds." O'Toole told BuzzFeed News that the reason the redeveloped script was changed to the present day was because of the results of the 2016 United States presidential election. She explained, "Suddenly it didn't feel like it should be a period piece anymore. All of the themes seemed more relevant, and we wanted to reconceptualize some things, and it felt like it really should be set in a contemporary world." The pilot episode was written by O'Toole and Rardin, and was based on a story by Urman. All three women became executive producers for the first season alongside Silberling, Ben Silverman, Howard T. Owens, and Carter Covington. The pilot episode was also directed by Silberling. After the pilot was filmed, Silberling told the "Metro" newspaper that the appeal of the reboot is to be "fun and contemporary" with its timely social observations. On May 11, The CW picked up the pilot and ordered the "Charmed" reboot to series with 13 episodes. On October 8, The CW ordered five additional scripts for the first season, and a month later, The CW ordered an additional nine episodes, bringing the first season total up to 22 episodes. On January 31, 2019, The CW gave the series an early renewal for a second season. According to Lesley Goldberg of "The Hollywood Reporter", "Charmed" was renewed due to strong international sales.
On March 25, 2019, it was announced that showrunner Carter Covington would be departing "Charmed" after the first season, with married duo Liz Kruger and Craig Shapiro taking over as showrunners for the second season. Covington was originally brought in as showrunner after "Charmed" was picked up to series, in order to help executive producers Jessica O'Toole and Amy Rardin, neither of whom had run a show before. Following the change in showrunners, media outlets reported that the second season would lean harder into the supernatural storylines, with less focus on the family dynamics that Covington helped make. However, ahead of the second-season premiere, Kruger stated in an interview with TV Insider that the core of the show and "the heart of the story is still about the power of sisterhood and how powerful women can change the world." Shapiro also told TV Insider that they changed the whole tone and visual look of the show to become more "darker, moodier, edgier" and "more cinematic" than the first season. Both Jeffrey Lieber and director Stuart Gillard also joined the second season as additional executive producers. On January 7, 2020, the series was given another early renewal for a third season. 
The CW renewed "Charmed" for an upcoming fourth season on February 3, 2021. On August 27, 2021, TVLine reported that Lieber, Joey Falco, and Nicki Renna will be taking over as showrunners for the fourth season, while Kruger and Shapiro will remain on the show as executive producers. Falco told TVLine that he and Renna "had a lot of time to think about things we want to see more of on the show", and described the fourth season as "the most fun, sexy, exciting season of "Charmed" yet". Renna commented that they are looking forward to taking "the show to places we've been wanting to, with storylines and emotional arcs that really excite us" and further added that the fourth season will focus more on stories about the sisters.
Casting.
Casting details for "Charmed" were first revealed by TVLine on February 7, 2018, with the three sisters bearing the unofficial names of Macy, Mel and Madison Pruitt. It also revealed that all ethnicities were being considered for each of the roles and that one of the sisters would be a lesbian, a major change from the original "Charmed" series where all Halliwell sisters were straight women. TVLine also revealed that casting was underway for the trio's "devilishly handsome" advisor/whitelighter Harry, Macy's "documentary filmmaker-boyfriend" Galvin, Madison's "sensitive loner ex-beau" Brian, and Mel's detective girlfriend Soo Jin. During production, Madison's name was later changed to Maggie, the sisters' family name was changed from Pruitt to Vera, Soo Jin's name was changed to Niko, and Galvin was rewritten as a scientist. Former "Into the Badlands" British actress Madeleine Mantock was cast as the eldest sister Macy, "a practical, driven, and brilliant geneticist". Mantock was cast after "Jane the Virgin" writer Micah Schraft, who she had worked with on another show five years prior, recommended her to the "Charmed" producers. Mantock did a Skype interview with the producers because she was in London at the time. In an interview with "Teen Vogue", Mantock revealed that she wanted to be part of the show after reading "how funny and smart and conscious" the pilot script was, saying "I thought it was a wonderful way to broach important subjects, be they women's issues or political issues, in a way that's also tied into this wonderful magical fantasy that everybody loves."
Film actress Melonie Diaz was cast as the middle sister Mel, "a passionate, outspoken activist" and lesbian. Diaz, who was the first sister cast in "Charmed", was chosen after a successful meeting with the producers, which she felt was "an instantaneous connection". Diaz was impressed with their vision for "Charmed", saying "I thought it was a really clever, unique way to kind of modernize this big show." Canadian actress Sarah Jeffery was cast as the youngest sister Maggie, "a bubbly college freshman" and sorority pledge. Jeffery revealed that the producers were at first wary of her auditioning for the show because she was still attached to "Shades of Blue". She auditioned for the show with scenes involving a demon dog and a fight with one of Maggie's sisters. Jeffery was eventually released from "Shades of Blue" so she could do "Charmed". Mantock, Diaz and Jeffery did not do any screen tests together, but the latter two described the trio's instant chemistry as "miraculous". Diaz stated, "We really feel like sisters," while Jeffery added, "We were lucky – it was an immediate connection. We have a sisterly rapport and it's reflected onscreen."
The lead actresses are of different ethnic backgrounds: Mantock is Afro-Caribbean, Diaz is Puerto Rican, and Jeffery is African American, English and Indigenous Canadian. However, in the series they all play Latina sisters, with Mantock's Macy and Jeffery's Maggie both being Afro-Latinas. Executive producer Jessica O'Toole told BuzzFeed News, "It was always written that way, specifically to have characters who were of color, and with the casting it all kind of came together." O'Toole also added that the decision to make the lead actresses non-white was one of the reasons the producers decided the show would not be based on the Halliwell sisters' children from the original "Charmed" series, who were all white. Executive producer Jennie Snyder Urman explained that "we've had a chance to see three white witches" and working on "Jane the Virgin", which had a predominantly Latino cast, helped her realize the importance of representation and "what it's like to see yourself onscreen and see yourself be the hero of the story". O'Toole said it was also important to represent the LGBTQ community, which was lacking in the original "Charmed" series, explaining: "Representation is important and I think it doesn't feel like the real world to not have that." O'Toole said "it felt very natural" to make one of the sisters gay and that "it didn't even come out of a purpose."
Former "Man in the High Castle" British actor Rupert Evans was cast as Harry, a college professor and the sisters' Whitelighter. Ser'Darius Blain was cast as Galvin, a love interest of Macy's. Blain departed the show at the end of the first season after his character was killed off. Charlie Gillespie was cast as Brian, a love interest of Maggie's who only appeared in the first two episodes of the series. Ellen Tamaki was cast in the first season as Niko, "a detective on the Hilltowne police force" and lesbian who is a love interest of Mel's. Tamaki did not return for the second season. Nick Hargrove was also cast in the first season as Parker, a fraternity president and new love interest of Maggie's. He was initially cast as recurring and was later promoted to the main cast. Hargrove did not return as a regular in the second season but did make several guest appearances during it. Jordan Donica was cast in the second season as Jordan, a mysterious law student and amateur boxer. Former "Shannara Chronicles" British actress Poppy Drayton also joined the second season as Abigael Caine, a powerful half-witch and half-demon. Both Donica and Drayton returned as regulars for the third season.
In July 2021, it was announced that Mantock had departed "Charmed", which resulted in her character Macy's death in the third-season finale. Mantock spoke of her departure in a statement to TVLine, saying: "Playing Macy on "Charmed" for the last three seasons has been an immense privilege and I have so enjoyed working with our fantastic producers, creatives, cast and crew. I'm incredibly grateful to The CW and CBS Studios for my time on the show and for being a brilliant support in my difficult decision to leave." Showrunners Liz Kruger and Craig Shapiro also told TVLine that they respect Mantock's decision to move on and that the door would always be "open for a return visit from Macy. . . one way or another!" On September 8, 2021, Australian actress Lucy Barrett was announced as Mantock's replacement as a new Charmed One for the upcoming fourth season. However, details about her character are being kept under wraps, including her name, backstory, powers, and connection to the show's remaining lead characters, Mel and Maggie. Showrunners Jeffrey Lieber, Joey Falco and Nicki Renna described Barrett's character as "an artist" who is "fun, irreverent, impulsive, strong-willed, and will bring a brand-new energy to the Power of Three".
Filming.
"Charmed" is filmed in Vancouver, Canada, where several other CW shows are filmed. Interior scenes for the show are filmed at the Whites Ironwood Studios in Vancouver. The historical J.E. Phillips House, located at 323 Queens Avenue in New Westminster, is used as the exterior for the show's fictional Vera Manor. It pays homage to the original "Charmed"s Halliwell Manor, in that it is a similar-looking red Victorian house. The exterior scenes used for Hilltowne University during the first season were filmed at the University of British Columbia's Point Grey Campus. The pilot episode was filmed from March 19 to April 7, 2018. After the pilot was picked up and "Charmed" was ordered to series, filming for the remainder of the first season resumed on August 13, 2018, and ended on April 26, 2019.
The second season began filming on July 24, 2019, and was expected to end on April 16, 2020. However, production was shut down early on March 12, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with only 19 of the ordered 22 episodes completed. The nineteenth episode ended up becoming the second-season finale, with the remaining three episodes filmed as part of the third season when production resumed, as the showrunners wanted to wrap up the storylines as they initially planned. Filming for the third season began on September 30, 2020 under strict COVID-19 protocols and concluded on May 22, 2021. The scenes used as Seattle State College during the third season were filmed at the Emily Carr University of Art and Design. The upcoming fourth season will begin filming on October 13, 2021, and is scheduled to finish filming on March 22, 2022.
Release.
In the United States, "Charmed" premiered on The CW on October 14, 2018. The first season aired on Sundays at 9:00pm, with "Supergirl" as its lead-in at 8:00 pm. The pairing of "Charmed" and "Supergirl" returned the network to original programming on Sunday nights for the first time since the 2008–09 U.S. television season. The CW president Mark Pedowitz explained, "We wanted to have an established show on Sunday night. We wanted name value with "Charmed" on there. We felt that it was two shows that are empowered women. We were making a statement that we were not kidding, that we're not phoning it in on Sunday night, that we were going to compete." Its second season premiered on October 11, 2019. The show's third-season premiere was delayed until January 24, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The upcoming fourth season is scheduled to premiere in 2022 as a mid-season replacement.
All complete seasons of "Charmed" are available to stream on Netflix in the U.S. only, as part of The CW's previous output deal with Netflix. Each season is released in full on Netflix eight days after its season finale has aired on The CW. The complete first season of "Charmed" was released on Netflix in May 2019. The first season was also released on region 4 DVD in Australia and New Zealand on September 25, 2019, and on region 1 DVD in the U.S. and Canada on October 1, 2019.

Reception.
Critical response.
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 71% approval rating with an average rating of 6.53/10, based on 31 reviews. The website's consensus reads, ""Charmed"'s updates are as fun as they are surprisingly feminist – and with a sharper focus, it could conjure up an even stronger show than the one that came before it". Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 55 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
Controversies.
Original cast and fan reactions.
Shortly after the pilot's announcement in January 2018, Holly Marie Combs, a cast member from the original "Charmed" series, took to Twitter and criticized The CW's decision to reboot the show without any input from the original cast or crew. Combs claimed to have an issue with The CW's "reimagining" of "Charmed" as the network, formerly known as The WB, chose not to renew the show in 2006 for a ninth season. Combs accused The CW of trying to cash in on the "Charmed" name and concept, while "capitalizing" on the original cast and crew's hard work. Combs also took issue with the network's description of a "feminist" reboot, which she felt implied the original series was not, by sarcastically tweeting: "Guess we forgot to do that the first go around. Hmph." Combs then implied that the reboot should have a new title, as she felt that it is a brand new show with no ties to the original "Charmed". She tweeted that television reboots or remakes "usually have storylines so similar to the original that they are legally required to use the same title and buy the rights to that title", further adding, "If it's not similar than ["sic"] it's just another show. A new show with a new title." Another original cast member, Alyssa Milano, told "Entertainment Tonight" that she wished the original cast were involved with the reboot from the beginning of its development at The CW, further adding "I do hope that it reaches the newer generation and impacts that generation the way ours was able to do for its generation."
Shannen Doherty was more positive about the reboot to fans on Twitter, stating that it was a testament to the original that a reboot was even being considered. She also added that she was "intrigued by the idea that a new generation might be comforted, inspired like you all were. "Charmed" helped us all in some way." However, Doherty admitted that she did take issue with The CW's description of a "feminist" reboot, by tweeting that their wording was "terrible and a bit offensive," but understood that "everyone makes mistakes". Doherty further voiced her support for the reboot in an interview with "Entertainment Tonight", stating "I think it's great. I think it's awesome...I'm happy to see that a show, that back then was all about strong women who supported and loved each other, is now coming back again in this day and age." Doherty appreciated the reboot for providing a lot of job opportunities for people, wished the cast and crew well, and hoped that fans of the original series would give the reboot a chance. Rose McGowan was also positive towards the reboot and showed her support to the new lead actresses by tweeting "fly girls, fly." McGowan also added that she had no issues with the reboot and wished "everyone the best". McGowan further voiced her support for the reboot on Instagram, posting "I wish nothing but the best for the new female actors whose careers hopefully will be launched by this show into something long and prosperous."
News of the reboot was met with a mixed response from fans of the original series. Some fans were positive about the reboot, while others were not impressed about the changes made to the series. Following the reboot announcement, fans took to Twitter and began to share the #StopCharmedReboot hashtag in attempts to prevent The CW from moving forward with the pilot. The CW's president Mark Pedowitz stated that he would like the fans to give the reboot a chance, telling fans that "before you make a decision, watch the series". In an interview with HuffPost in May 2018, Combs spoke up about the reboot again, this time criticizing the show's marketing and the casting of younger actors. She stated that although she appreciates "the jobs and opportunities the "Charmed" reboot has created", she "will never understand what is fierce, funny, or feminist in creating a show that basically says the original actresses are too old to do a job they did 12 years ago". Milano also spoke up about the reboot again to "Us Weekly" in May 2019, stating that she felt the show "ruined any possibility" of a reunion between the four original lead actresses, calling it "disrespectful" and "sad" that they were not involved from the beginning. Milano believed that they "would have come [together] to do something" as they "created that world" first.
Accusations of colorism.
While the series was praised for its diversity by casting three women of color in the lead roles, it also received backlash from some television critics for being promoted as a Latina-led series when only one of the lead actresses is Latina. Madeleine Mantock, who learned Spanish for the role, said, "I'm open with the writers and trying to be respectful because I'm Afro-Caribbean. I'm not actually Afro-Latina and I want to make that inquiry because Melonie [Diaz] is actually the only person in her real life who is Latina." Sarah Jeffery explained, "I know that we are representing the Latina community. I actually am African-American. I'm not Latina, which is a common misconception." Latina writer Samantha Chavarria of the website "We Are Mitu" felt that this news does "highlight the very real fact that in their effort to promote a reboot, the CW used colorism and exploitation to spark our excitement and interest." Chavarria further criticized the network for not correcting the misinformation about the cast's ethnicities, calling it an "ultimate stab to the wound" and "just plain shady". Another Latino writer Patrick Gomez of "Entertainment Weekly" was more forgiving of the casting because the actresses were honest and that a search into their ethnicities would have been inappropriate, adding, "I hope people celebrate the fact that an African-American and an Afro-Caribbean woman are being cast as 'Latinas' because Afro-Latina people are not given even a fraction of the visibility they should have in on-camera representations of Latinx people." Princess Weekes of "The Mary Sue" felt that the actresses were not to blame, but also criticized The CW's use of colorism for "the idea that because they are lighter-skinned women with long hair, they can 'pass' for Latina when they are actually black women."

Italian frigate Carabiniere (F 581)

Carabiniere was a frigate operated by the Italian Navy. Launched in 1967, the vessel served in the anti-submarine role during the Cold War until 1992. The ship was then recommissioned as a testing platform for new weapons systems, including Aster, finally retiring in 2008.
Design.
The ships of the were authorised in the 1959/1960 Italian naval programme. The second ship in the class, "Climene", was laid down in 1963 but was renamed "Carabiniere" in June 1965 prior to being launched in 1967. "Carabiniere" was the third vessel in Italian service to be so named.
Armament.
As originally designed, "Climene" was to have armament based on the preceding . Optimised for anti-submarine warfare, the vessel was designed around a hangar for an Agusta-Bell AB.204 helicopter. Close-in anti-submarine defence was provided by six Mark 44 torpedoes launched from Mark 32 torpedo tubes complemented by a single-barrel Menon mortar mounted forward. An early drawing shows the hangar straddled by a pair of guns with a single gun mounted fore and aft to provide anti-aircraft defence. By 1962, the efficacy of the 40 mm was in doubt and the design was redrawn with three 76 mm guns, but even this was deemed insufficient. At launch, the vessel had no less than six single mounts.
Propulsion.
The propulsion system used a combined diesel and gas (CODAG) system as first trialled on the destroyer "San Giorgio". Two diesels and one gas turbine were allied per shaft with a hydraulic coupling to enable the vessel to either run on diesel power alone, at low speed, or diesels, at high speed, and gas turbines simultaneously. Two Tosi OTV-320 diesels were paired with each Tosi-Metrovick G.6 gas turbine to provide a maximum speed of on diesels alone and with all engines running.
Service.
Anti-submarine frigate.
Commissioned on 28 April 1968, "Carabiniere" served with the 1º Gruppo Navale d'Altura based at La Spezia. In 1973, when the school ship "Amerigo Vespucci" was inactive due to maintenance, "Carabiniere" was one of a number of Italian naval vessels used as a summer school cruise ship for students at the Italian Naval Academy. The vessel subsequently visited Istanbul, Odessa and Sevastopol alongside the destroyer .
During the 1970s, the ship was updated. The helicopters were replaced by the more capable AB-212ASW and a SLQ-A ECM system was added. The ship was further upgraded in the 1980s. Hull-mounted sonar and the SLQ-747 ECM suite was fitted.
Weapons testing ship.
On 1 April 1992, the ship was decommissioned and re-equipped as a testing platform for a new generation of Italian naval weapons such as Aster and MILAS. The gas turbine, Menon mortar, variable depth sonar and five 76 mm mounts, along with two fire control radars, were removed. Removing the gas turbines restricted the top speed to . Helicopter operating capability was also disabled. A SPY-702 search radar was installed along with Sylver missile launchers. The most obvious change was the installation of a large antenna midships for the EMPAR radar (also known as AN/SPY-790) which used the space previously occupied by the gas turbine exhaust. This combination of systems enabled "Carabiniere" to act as a testbed for PAAMS and SAAM-IT.
"Carabiniere" re-entered service in 31 December 1994 as a dedicated test ship but retained the penant designation of a frigate. The vessel undertook successful live firing trials of both Aster 15 from Sylver A-43 launchers and Aster 30 from Sylver A-50 launchers.
"Carabiniere" was finally decommissioned on 19 November 2008 in the presence of the Naval Chief of Staff Paolo La Rosa and Head of the Carabiniere Gianfrancesco Siazzu.

Walter Moody

Walter Leroy Moody Jr. (March 24, 1935 – April 19, 2018) was an American convicted murderer who was sentenced to death and executed in Alabama for the 1989 letter bomb murder of Robert S. Vance, a U.S. federal judge serving on the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.
When Moody was executed by lethal injection in April 2018, he became the oldest death row inmate to be executed since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976.
Background.
Moody was born on March 24, 1935, in Rex, Georgia, and grew up in Fort Valley. He grew up as the oldest of three children and spent much of his time "tinkering with machinery". He graduated from Peach County High School in 1953, and held a multitude of military positions in the years to 1961.
Following his departure from the military, Moody resumed his education. Taking classes at a small college, he considered becoming a neurosurgeon but he did not make good grades. He was later able to take some law school classes. After a psychiatric evaluation in 1967, he was characterized as harboring violent thoughts, and the doctor evaluating him, Thomas M. Hall, testified that he was "constantly afraid" that Moody might get into a situation that would end up in "some sort of destruction toward society."
On May 7, 1972, Moody's wife at the time, Hazel, opened a package she found in their kitchen. It turned out to be a homemade pipe bomb that exploded in front of her, tearing up her hand, thigh and shoulder, and sending scrap metal into her eye. She required six operations to deal with all of her injuries. Moody was tried for making the bomb with intent to send it to an auto dealer who had repossessed Moody's car, and on October 19, 1972, he was found not guilty of making the bomb, but was convicted of possessing it and sentenced to five years in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary.
Moody and his wife were divorced shortly after his conviction.
Vance's murder and connected bombings.
On December 16, 1989, federal judge Robert Vance was assassinated at his home in Mountain Brook, Alabama, when he opened a package containing a makeshift pipe bomb. Vance died instantly and his wife, Helen, was seriously injured. After an extensive investigation, Moody and his second wife, Susan McBride, were arrested on July 13, 1990. McBride was released on $250,000 bail within a week and later testified against Moody pursuant to an immunity agreement.
Moody was charged with the murders of Judge Vance and of Robert E. Robinson, a black civil-rights attorney based in Savannah, Georgia, who had been killed in a separate explosion at his office two days later on Monday, December 18. Moody was also charged with mailing bombs that were defused at the Eleventh Circuit Court's headquarters in Atlanta and at the Jacksonville, Florida, office of Willye Dennis of the NAACP.
Louis J. Freeh, who prosecuted the federal case at Robert Mueller’s behest, said that the bombings at the offices of both Robinson and the NAACP were meant to deflect attention away from Moody. Moody's killing of Vance and his attempted bombing of the Eleventh Circuit were motivated by the Court's refusal to expunge Moody's conviction for the 1972 explosion in his home, despite the fact that Vance was neither on the panel that made that decision, nor was he responsible for its decision.
Trial, death row, and execution.
After an order was entered directing the recusal of all circuit and district judges within the Eleventh Circuit, Moody's trial for murder and related crimes was presided over by Judge Edward Devitt, of the District of Minnesota. After a successful prosecution by special prosecutors Louis J. Freeh and Howard Shapiro, Moody was convicted on all counts. He was sentenced to seven federal life terms. An Alabama state-court jury later convicted Moody of Judge Vance's murder; Moody was sentenced to death by electrocution in 1997. He stayed on death row at the Holman Correctional Facility near Atmore, Alabama, from February 13, 1997.
Moody was alleged to have attempted to run a Ponzi scheme from death row some time around 2015, according to an anonymous elderly Florida woman who claimed to have received a letter with a Holman Correctional Facility return address from Moody—although Moody was not known to have faced any disciplinary action as a result.
On February 23, 2018, an execution date for Moody was set for April 19, 2018. He was subsequently executed on this date, at 8:42pm. Aged 83 years and 26 days at execution, he was both the oldest death row inmate in Alabama since James Hubbard was executed in 2004, and the oldest inmate executed in the United States in the post-Furman era, surpassing the previous record set by the execution of John B. Nixon Sr., who was executed in Mississippi in December 2005 at the age of 77 years, 8 months and 13 days. He declined to make a final statement and his last meal was Philly Cheesesteaks, Dr Pepper, and M&amp;M's.
Popular culture.
The case was featured in the episode "Deadly Delivery" of "Forensic Files" which first aired on October 29, 1998. It was also featured in the episode "Living in Terror" of "The New Detectives", and in "FBI Criminal Pursuit" (Season 1, Episode 1 – "Murder By Mail").

Alma Hall

Alma Hall is the home of Alma Lodge #523 of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, located in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Alma Hall was the first four-story building in the city of Johnstown, and is the oldest building built by a fraternal organization in downtown Johnstown. The building served as a refuge for survivors of the Johnstown Flood in 1889.
Building History.
Alma Hall was officially opened on August 30, 1884. The building was constructed as the home of Alma Lodge, but also served as offices for local doctors, attorneys, and other professionals. The building is an example of Queen Anne style architecture and was one of the first four-story buildings in downtown Johnstown.
The 1889 Johnstown Flood.
Alma Hall was one of four buildings that survived the Johnstown Flood in 1889, being shielded by the First Methodist Episcopal Church (now Franklin Street United Methodist Church). While the first floor was under water and debris, the remaining floors were quickly occupied by 264 survivors. The survivors included Dr. W.E. Matthews who helped those who needed medical attention (including delivering two babies) while suffering from three cracked ribs. Another survivor was Attorney James Walters, who was carried by the flood waters and thrown through the window into his own office. The building was used as a headquarters for relief distribution following the flood.
Alma Hall Today.
As it has since its opening, Alma Lodge #523, I.O.O.F. serves as the owner and primary tenant of the building. William F. Packer Encampment, a subordinate branch of the order, also meets at the lodge. The lodge and encampment offices are located on the second floor and the meeting room and dining room are located on the fourth floor. A smoke shop and collectibles shop are located on the ground floor, while an attorney and an accountant occupy space on the second floor. The building's third floor is currently vacant, but is used by the lodge as storage space.

Palermo Ring Railway

The Palermo Rail Ring is a railway line under construction in Sicily, Italy. It is expected to open in 2021 or 2022 and will extend from Palermo Notarbartolo railway station to Giachery station.
History.
The two main aims of the project are to improve commuter traffic in and around Palermo and also to reduce urban congestion in the city. Another objective is to improve the sustainable mobility of the area. During the construction period, about 750 new jobs are expected to be created.
Route.
The eventual planned route is to be an underground circular single track railway with a length of about 6.5 km, and is due for completion in 2018.
Stations.
New underground stations on the line are as follows:
Future.
The long term plan for the railway is for the ring to be extended south to Termini Imerese, and a railway bypass will be built at Palermo Centrale. Rail transport services on this section that connects Palermo Centrale to the Airport, will take place every 15 minutes compared to the present frequency of 30 minutes.

Baerresen Brothers

The Baerresen Brothers were Danish-born architects based in Denver, Colorado. A number of their works are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
Both were born in Copenhagen, Denmark: Harold W. Baerresen was born January 20, 1846; Viggio Egede Baerresen was born on March 13, 1858. Harold W. began practice in Denver in 1879, forming a partnership with his brother in 1887. Harold W.'s son, Albert A. Baerresen, was also associated with his father's firm for many years, and operated a branch office in Cheyenne, Wyoming before establishing an independent practice in that city. From 1920 to 1922 he was in partnership with Frederic Hutchinson Porter. After Harold died in 1918, Viggio continued the firm until retiring in 1928.

Chantal Zakari

Chantal Zakari is an interdisciplinary artist, designer and art educator; a Turkish Levantine (and U.S. citizen) now residing in the Boston area.
She is a full-time faculty member at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts, where she chaired the Graphic Arts area from 1998 until 2015, and was an active faculty voice while the SMFA was undergoing the transition in its long-standing affiliation with Tufts University. She was an associate member of the Goat Island performance group from 1995 to 2009 and has served on the board of Belmont World Film.
Career.
Zakari's studio practice freely combines research methodologies and artistic strategies borrowed from various disciplines such as photography, documentary, performance, storytelling, installation, graphic design and social interventions. According to her web site, Zakari draws upon contemporary social issues by making connections through personal narratives, history and popular culture.
Combining her skills as a graphic designer and an artist, Zakari's work often culminates in the form of an artist's book. One of her early projects was a diary "The Turk and the Je"w on which she collaborated with her husband Mike Mandel while he lived in Pullman, Washington and she in Chicago, Illinois. They used the web as a means to communicate daily and further explore their cultural differences, then published the diary as an artists' book in 1998.
The book "webAffairs" (2005) is a narrative, told in photographs and text, of Zakari's experience in virtual space. Using a pseudonym, she began a four-year-long performance and documentation of a webcam community where people meet to have virtual sex. The book comments on viewer's relationship to technology, the objectification of the body, personal surveillance tools and gender performativity.
For fifteen years, Zakari and Mandel collaborated on a body of work about the conflict between secularist culture and the Islamist movement in Turkey. Their journey, which began in 1997, resulted in photographic images, video interviews and public performances. In 2010 they published an encyclopedic artists' book, "The State of Ata" (2010) followed later by a conceptual exhibition "7 Turkish Artists."
Zakari and Mandel produced the book "Lockdown Archive" (2015) in response to the manhunt and lockdown of April 19, 2013, in their hometown of Watertown, Massachusetts. The couple designed and produced a series of commemorative porcelain plates "Shelter in Plates" depicting SWAT teams and heavy artillery near their home during the lockdown.
Collections.
Zakari's work is in the permanent collections at Yale University Library, Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Getty Research Institute library, The Kinsey Institute Library, Institute of Network Cultures in Amsterdam and the Addison Gallery of American Art.
Exhibitions.
She has had solo exhibitions in Boston, Baltimore, Atlanta, Los Angeles and also in Izmir and Ankara, Turkey.
Recent exhibitions include "Relay," January 2017 and "Strategic Planning," January 2018 at Kingston Gallery, "Boston and Art in the Age of the Internet, 1989 to Today" at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, and "Shelter in Plates" at the Fitchburg Art Museum and at the Addison Gallery of American Art.

Lazare Weiller

Lazare Weiller (20 July 1858 – 12 August 1928) was a French engineer, industrialist and politician. He was born in Alsace and received a technical education in England and in his cousin's copper factory in Angoulême. He was very interested in the physical sciences, particularly the use of electricity to transmit sound and images. He proposed a system for scanning, transmitting and displaying images that was the basis for experiments by various television pioneers. He sponsored early aviation experiments by the Wright brothers. He founded several companies including a telephone wire manufacturer, a taximeter manufacturer, the first Parisian cab company to use automobiles, an aircraft company and a wireless telegraphy company. 
He was a deputy during World War I (1914–18) and then a senator until his death.
Life.
Lazare Weiller was born in Sélestat, Bas-Rhin, on 20 July 1858.
His parents were Leopold Weiller (born 1807) and Reine Ducasse/Duckes (born 1819).
He came from a Jewish family of Alsace.
His grandfather, Bar Koschel, had applied for French citizenship in Seppois-le-Bas in 1808, took the name Bernhard Weiller, settled in Sélestat and became a "Judaic teacher".
His father Léopold, a trader, married Reine Duckes, a servant.
His family became wealthy.
Alsace became part of Germany in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian War.
Weiller's mother was an ardent patriot and wanted him to study in France.
He was sent to Angoulême to stay with his uncle Moïse Weille while he attended school.
His uncle had a business making metal fabrics for the paper industry that he had transferred from Sélestat to Angoulême.
Weiller went on to the Lycée Saint-Louis in Paris.
He was not able to enter the École Polytechnique due to health problems, and instead went to Trinity College, Oxford, in England to improve his English and study Greek, physics and chemistry.
After his military service he joined his uncle's company in Angoulême.
In 1882 Weiller converted to Catholicism.
He married his niece Marie Marguerite Jeanne Weiller, but she died soon after.
In 1883 Weiller founded the Société Lazare Weiller to make telephone and telegraph wire, which later became the Tréfileries et Laminoirs du Havre (TLH).
On 12 August 1889 Weiller married Alice Javal (1870–1943) in Paris.
She was the daughter and granddaughter of deputies of Yonne.
Her father was Louis Émile Javal (1839–1907).
Javal was an ophthalmologist, author of many papers on eye care and eye defects, who was deputy from 1885 to 1889.
Their children were Jean-Pierre (born 1890), Marie-Thérèse (born 1890), Georges-André (born 1892) and Paul-Louis (1893–1993).
Weiller visited the United States in 1901 and was very impressed by the booming economy and the metallurgical, electrical and mechanical industries.
He wrote a book on the subject, "Les grandes idées d'un grand peuple" (The Great Ideas of a Great People).
Weiller met the men who controlled the Chicago meat trusts, whom he called "simple, energetic and gentle men who were completely absorbed in their work, except perhaps M. Armour and his associate, M. [Arthur] Meeker, both of whom are passionate about automobiles."
He visited the theater in New York, where he found the plays to be mediocre, although the performers were animated. 
He tried to explain the racial prejudice he found during his stay in Washington,
Later he wrote a series on "Souvenirs d'Amérique" in a Strasbourg newspaper.
He observed that the working men of the USA had "a fine sense of their own worth, so that they did not suffer the bitterness and the meanness of class envy, an inestimable boon". 
They did not, as in Europe, form great radical political parties with the aim of overthrowing the existing order, but instead devoted all their effort to rising to a higher social level.
Weiller lost control of TLH when copper prices collapsed in 1901.
At that time he also had to sell his Château d’Osny and his magnificent collection of paintings.
However, he recovered and went on to found ventures such as a large fleet of Parisian automobile taxis, a manufacturer of airplanes and a wireless telegraphy company, and was on the board of various other companies.
Emmanuel Chadeau sees Weiller as a good entrepreneur who did not have the managerial skills needed to operate the firms he founded.
Weiller was a deputy for Charente from 1914 to 1919, and a senator from 1920 until his death.
In 1920 Weiller bought the Château de Dampierre, a large 19th-century building close to the "Chais Magelis" in Angoulème.
He also built a luxury villa in Cannes, and bought the Hôtel de la lieutenance in Sélestat.
Lazare Weiller died in Territet, Vaud, Switzerland on 12 August 1928.
During World War II his wife was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where she died on 7 September 1943.
His grandson Paul-Annick Weiller married the granddaughter of Alfonso XIII of Spain, and his great-granddaughter Sibilla Weiller y Torlonia married Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg.
Science and technology.
Weiller was very interested in the physical sciences, and particularly electricity.
In October 1889 he published a major article "Sur la vision à distance par l’électricité" (On vision at a distance by electricity) where he proposed a way to scan, transmit and project images.
Weiller said he was inspired by the experiments by Jules Antoine Lissajous, who had used light reflected from small mirrors to investigate vibratory motion.
His proposal was to use a rotating drum to which a number of tangential mirrors were attached, oriented so the image was scanned into a series of lines projected onto a selenium cell.
The resulting electrical signal was transmitted over a wire, converted by a "telephone à gaz" back to light that was shone onto an identical mirror drum synchronized with the first drum, which would project the image onto a screen.
Jules Verne wrote a short story for the "New York Forum" about a phonotelephotograph machine based on Weiller's invention, which he imagined to have finally become a reality in 2889 AD.
Weiller's article on television did not have an immediate impact.
The French researcher Marcel Brillouin wrote in the "Revue générale des sciences pures et appliquées" (Paris, 30 January 1891) that "M Weiller's 360-mirror cylinder ... is almost impossible to construct if you want fidelity."
Constantin Perskyi did not mention the proposal in a 1900 paper on television by means of electricity.
Later the concept was used by television pioneers in the US, UK and Germany such as Boris Rosing, Ernst Alexanderson, John Logie Baird and August Karolus() and was commercially available by 1932.
Weiller did not follow up on his television invention, but instead turned to wireless telegraphy.
Weiller wrote papers on scientific subjects such as "Etudes électriques et mécaniques sur les corps solides" (1885) and "Traité général des lignes et transmissions électriques" (1892), as well as many articles in the "Revue des deux Mondes" and "Le Temps".
Weiller was involved in early aviation experiments, and devoted 500,000 francs to helping the experiments of the Wright brothers, particularly to those of his friend Wilbur Wright.
On 23 March 1908 Weiller agreed on terms for the French rights to the Wright brothers' invention.
The patents were later used by his Compagnie de navigation aérienne.
Weiller was a member of the Société de Physique, the Société internationale des électriciens and the Société des ingénieurs civils among others.
Industry.
While working at his cousin's copper fabric factory Weiller became interested in the problem of drawing copper wires, for which there was growing demand.
He adapted the process of rolling hot steel rods to making copper wire.
Weiller created the Société Lazare Weiller in 1883, with its first factory in Angoulême, and was the main owner of the enterprise.
He developed a bronze alloy that combined the conductivity of copper with the strength to remain stretched between poles apart, of great value to telegraph and telephone companies, and obtained several patents in France and other countries.
Weiller collaborated with Jules Lair of the Institut de France in manufacturing and distributing telephones in France.
Weiller joined the board of the Société des téléphones, which was both a customer and an investor in his company.
Weiller acquired land along the Paris–Le Havre railway and the new Canal de Tancarville in 1895, and in 1896 built a larger factory at Graville() in the Le Havre region.
In 1898 the Le Havre factory included forges, foundries, rolling mills and wireworks and processed copper, steel, aluminum, brass, bronze and nickel. 
The bulk of the output was for electrical equipment and construction of telephone and telegraph lines.
In 1901 the company became the Tréfileries et Laminoirs du Havre (TLH).
Weiller became associated with Swiss banks, and from 1907 started to acquire facilities and companies to build a huge industrial complex.
TLH grew through acquisitions and mergers to gain a dominant position in the industry.
In 1913 TLH's assets were 57,800,000 francs, making it the 22nd largest industrial company in France, and the third largest manufacturer of electrical equipment after the Compagnie Francaise Thomson-Houston and Compagnie Générale d'Electricité.
Weiller manufactured "taximeters" to measure mileage and founded the first automobile cab company in Paris.
He founded the taximeter company in 1903 and the Société des fiacres automobiles (Automobile Cab Company) in 1905 in partnership with banks and car manufacturers.
In 1905 the company ordered 250 8-horsepower 2-cylinder type AG cars from Renault, later called the "Taxis de la Marne".
Renault started serial production to fill the order.
The cars were fitted with taximeters.
As of 1911 the Compagnie des Fiacres Automobiles had more than 3,000 of the small red Renault automobiles.
A new town was built in Levallois-Perret where seven or eight thousand employees and workers prepared or drove the "automobiles de place".
In 1908 Weiller was president of the TLH, the Chantiers de Dunkerque, the Chantiers de Normandie and the Société métallurgique bordelaise.
He was a board member of the Entrepôts du Havre, the Docks de Rouen and the Compagnie des Voitures de Place in Paris. 
He worked with the Banque française de l'Afrique du Sud and the Maison de Banque Bauer et Marchal. 
The Weiller family also had interests in German Alsace.
In 1908 Weiller created a prize of $10,000 for the first person to achieve flight in France.
By June 1908 the recent flights of Henri Farman and Léon Delagrange had reduced Weiller's confidence in the Wrights. 
Wilbur Wright wrote that he was "about scared out".
By the end of the year these doubts had vanished as the Wright brothers made repeated demonstrations of their machines.
Weiller formed a syndicate, the Compagnie Générale de Navigation Aérienne (CGNA: General Air Navigation Company), to market aircraft using the Wright design.
Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe was his partner in the venture.
They did not build the machines, but contracted with the airship firm Société Astra and the Ateliers et Chantiers de France of Dunkirk for the airframes and with Bariquand et Marre() for the engines.
Weiller had interests in both the Chantiers de Dunkerque and Barriquand et Marre.
The CGNA was not particularly profitable.
It claimed to have received 50 orders for airplanes, but probably did not deliver more than 25.
The first flight was made on 3 February 1909.
In September 1912 Weiller created the Compagnie universelle de télégraphie et téléphonie sans fil (CUTT: Universal Wireless Telegraphy Company).
He was president, and participants included the German firm C. Lorenz AG, French banks and investors, and the American banker J. P. Morgan.
CUTT bought Rudolf Goldschmidt's patents for use outside Germany from Hochfrequenmaschinen AG für drahtlose Telegraphie (Homag) and bought its Tuckerton, New Jersey, station.
The station was to be delivered as soon as it was completed by Homag.
Weiller worked with Guglielmo Marconi to set up the first transatlantic telegraphy station, which Telefunken opened in Hamburg in 1913.
The CUTT was forced out of business due to nationalist outrage at a French telegraphy service depending on an alliance between a Jew and a German.
In September 1913 the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company purchased the patents and CUTT shares from Weiller.
Weiller was also director of various mining and electrical companies.
Politics.
Weiller ran for election to the Chamber of Deputies in 1888 as a republican candidate for Angoulême during the Boulangism crisis, but was defeated.
In 1914 at the request of the government Weiller visited Switzerland and wrote a report on German propaganda abroad and the shortage of raw materials in Germany.
He was elected deputy for Charente from 10 May 1914 to 7 December 1919.
In the chamber he spoke for the people of his native Alsace, which was occupied by Germany at that time.
He sat with the left, and was a member of the committees on tax legislation and on posts and telegraphs.
In 1917 Weiller submitted a project for the people of Alsace-Lorraine to adopt French versions of their [German] names to "protect them from public malignity and the reprisals of the mob".
It was rejected for patriotic reasons, since the Alsace-Lorrainers were considered to have always been part of the French family.
Weiller ran for reelection on 16 November 1919 but was defeated.
He was elected senator for Charente on 11 January 1920 and reelected on 9 January 1927, holding office until his death.
On 23 March 1920 "Le Figaro" published an article by Weiller in which he argued that France could have achieved a favorable end to the war in 1917 if she had had a representative in the Vatican during peace negotiations at that time.
He sat with the democratic left group, and was a member of the foreign affairs committee.

Lin Hu (general)

Lin Hu (; 26 December 1927 – 3 March 2018) was a Chinese aviator, fighter pilot and lieutenant general of the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF). Born to a Russian mother and a Chinese father, he was orphaned at a young age. Lin joined the Eighth Route Army to fight in the Second Sino-Japanese War before he turned 11. After the Second World War, he was trained as a fighter pilot and fought in the Korean War and the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. He served as deputy commander of the PLA Air Force from 1985 to 1994 and attained the rank of lieutenant general in 1988.
Early life.
Lin Hu was born on 26 December 1927 in Harbin, Heilongjiang province. His father, originally from Zhaoyuan, Shandong province, moved to Harbin. There he met Lin's mother, a Russian woman, who gave birth to three children. Lin was the middle child, with an older sister and a younger brother. When Lin Hu was just a few years old, his father froze to death in a winter night after falling asleep on a coal train. Soon afterward, his mother and brother both fell ill and died. Orphaned at a young age, he was adopted by a family surnamed Lin and was given the name Lin Gensheng (). His sister was adopted by a different family.
Wartime career.
After the Japanese invasion of China, Lin joined the Eighth Route Army in October 1938 and fought in the Communist guerrilla base in the Yimeng Mountains of Shandong province, before he turned 11; he was renamed as Lin Hu ("forest tiger") by his superiors.
In 1945, Lin became a member of the Communist Party of China. After the surrender of Japan at the end of the Second World War, the Communist Northeast Army took over a number of Japanese warplanes, pilots, and mechanics in the former Japanese puppet state Manchukuo, and established its first aviation school, the Northeast China Democratic United Army Aviation School (a predecessor of the PLA Air Force Aviation University). Lin was selected to receive pilot training at the school, from which he graduated in 1949. At the Founding Ceremony of the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949, Lin piloted a P-51 Mustang fighter and flew across the sky over the Tiananmen in Beijing.
During the Korean War, Lin was a deputy regiment commander of the People's Volunteer Army Air Force. He was credited with shooting down one and damaging another F-86 Sabre, the best jet fighter of the United States Air Force. After the end of the war, Lin was promoted to deputy commander of the 18th Division of the PLA Air Force based at the Shadi Air Base in Foshan, Guangdong. During the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958, he shot down two Taiwanese warplanes and damaged a third.
Later career.
Lin later successively served as deputy corps commander, deputy commander of a PLAAF command post, deputy commander of a military region air force, and deputy commandant of the PLAAF Command Academy. In 1985, he was promoted to deputy commander of the PLA Air Force, serving under Commander Wang Hai, and alongside Li Yongtai and Liu Zhitian, all Korean War veterans. He was awarded the rank of lieutenant general in 1988. He was also a deputy to the 7th and the 8th National People's Congress. He retired from active service in October 1994.
In August 1997, Lin made his last flight with a Sukhoi Su-30 at the MAKS Air Show. He executed a series of aerobatic maneuvers including the Pugachev's Cobra, in cooperation with Anatoly Kvochur.
In January 2002, Lin published the book "Fight to Protect the Motherland's Airspace—A Retrospective of the Air Battles in the First Twenty Years of New China" (), describing the PLAAF's defense operations between 1949 and 1969.
Death.
Lin died in the evening of 3 March 2018, at the age of 90 (91 by East Asian age reckoning). He died on the same day as his friend and colleague, fellow Korean War veteran and PLAAF lieutenant general Yao Xian. They were born in the same year and graduated from the same aviation school.
Personal life.
Lin Hu had a daughter named Lin Li ().

<doc id="56750304" url="?curid=56750304" title="Homoplasy">
Homoplasy

Homoplasy, in biology and phylogenetics, is when a trait has been gained or lost independently in separate lineages over the course of evolution. This is different from homology, which is when the similarity of traits can be parsimoniously explained by common ancestry. Homoplasy can arise from both similar selection pressures acting on adapting species, and the effects of genetic drift. 
Most often, homoplasy is viewed as a similarity in morphological traits. However, homoplasy may also appear in other trait types, such as similarity in the genetic sequence, life cycle types or even behavioral traits.
Etymology.
The term homoplasy was first used by Ray Lankester in 1870. The corresponding adjective is either "homoplasic" or "homoplastic".
It is derived from the two ancient Greek words (), meaning "similar, alike, the same", and (), meaning "to shape, to mold".
Parallelism and convergence.
Parallel and convergent evolution lead to homoplasy when different species independently evolve or gain a comparable trait, which diverges from the trait inferred to have been present in their common ancestor. When the similar traits are caused by an equivalent developmental mechanism, the process is referred to as parallel evolution. The process is called convergent evolution when the similarity arises from different developmental mechanisms. These types of homoplasy may occur when different lineages live in comparable ecological niches that require similar adaptations for an increase in fitness. An interesting example is that of the marsupial moles (Notoryctidae), golden moles (Chrysochloridae) and northern moles (Talpidae). These are mammals from different geographical regions and lineages, and have all independently evolved very similar burrowing characteristics (such as a cone-shaped heads and flat frontal claws) to live in a subterranean ecological niche.
Reversion.
In contrast, reversal (a.k.a. vestigialization) leads to homoplasy through the disappearance of previously gained traits. This process may result from changes in the environment in which certain gained traits are no longer relevant, or have even become costly. This can be observed in subterranean and cave-dwelling animals by their loss of sight, in cave-dwelling animals through their loss of pigmentation, and in both snakes and legless lizards through their loss of limbs.
Distinguishing homology from homoplasy.
Homoplasy, especially the type that occurs in more closely related phylogenetic groups, can make phylogenetic analysis more challenging. Phylogenetic trees are often created by means of parsimony analysis. These analyses can be done with phenotypic, as well as genetic traits (DNA sequences). Using parsimony analysis, the hypothesis of relationships that requires the fewest evolutionary changes is preferred over alternative hypotheses. Construction of these trees may become a challenge when clouded by the occurrence of homoplasy in the traits used for the analysis. The most important approach to overcoming these challenges is to increase the number of independent (non-pleiotropic, non-linked) characteristics used in the phylogenetic analysis. Along with parsimony analysis, one could perform a likelihood analysis, where the most likely tree, given a particular model of evolution, is selected and branch lengths are measured.
According to cladistic interpretation, homoplasy can be identified when the distribution of a trait cannot be explained by descent from a common ancestor on a preferred phylogenetic hypothesis - that is, the feature in question arises (or disappears) at more than one point on the tree.
In the case of DNA sequences, homoplasy is very common due to the redundancy of the genetic code. An observed homoplasy may simply be the result of random nucleotide substitutions accumulating over time, and thus may not need an adaptationist evolutionary explanation.
Examples and applications of homoplasy.
There are numerous documented examples of homoplasy within the following taxa:
The occurrence of homoplasy can also be used to make predictions about evolution. Recent studies have used homoplasy to predict the possibility and the path of extraterrestrial evolution. For example, Levin et al. (2017) suggest that the development of eye-like structures is highly likely, due to its numerous, independently evolved incidences on earth.
Homoplasy vs. evolutionary contingency.
In his book "Wonderful Life", Stephen Jay Gould claims that repeating the evolutionary process, from any point in time onward, would not produce the same results. The occurrence of homoplasy is viewed by some biologists as an argument against Gould’s theory of evolutionary contingency. Powell &amp; Mariscal (2015) argue that this disagreement is caused by an equivocation and that both the theory of contingency as well as homoplastic occurrence can be true at the same time.

Casper Ehrenborg

Casper Isaac Michael Ehrenborg (17 November 1788 – 16 September 1823) was a Swedish politician.
He was born in Allerum on 17 November 1788 to parents Jöns Ehrenborg and Beata Maria Tham. His maternal grandfather was military officer Isak Tham. Ehrenborg married Anna Fredrica Carlqvist in 1811, with whom he raised three children, Betty Ehrenborg, Richard Ehrenborg and Ulla Bring.
Ehrenborg began his legal career in the 1800s, working for the Göta Court of Appeal. He progressed through the judicial hierarchy, having been assigned to the administrative courts of appeal and to the Skaraborg County government by 1810. In 1821, Ehrenborg was named deputy governor of Skaraborg, serving until 1823, when he was appointed Parliamentary Ombudsman of the Riksdag of the Estates. Ehrenborg died later that year on 16 September 1823, in Stockholm Municipality.

Jeruel Academy

Jeruel Academy was a school for African Americans established in Athens, Georgia in 1881. Classes were originally held at Landrum Chapel,
part of Ebenezer Baptist Church, West. The school was organized by the Rev. Collins Henry Lyons. A school building was constructed in 1886. Courses included English, Greek, Latin, French, history, mathematics, public speaking, agriculture, sewing, cooking, music, and printing. The school was merged with three others in 1924 to become part of Union Baptist Institute. After Baptist institute was dissolved during the desegregation era the building was demolished in 1956. The site is now part of the University of Georgia campus and commemorated by a historical marker. An image of the building by Jackson Davis shows a three-story structure with some window openings in the roofline. Hampton Collins Moon went to school at Jeruel Academy and worked as a steward for several terms while he was there to earn some money. Numerous alumni of Atlanta Baptist College taught at the school.

Statue of Robert R. Livingston

Robert R. Livingston is an 1875 bronze sculpture of Robert R. Livingston, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, executed by the New York born sculptor Erastus Dow Palmer. The state is installed in the United States Capitol, in Washington, D.C., as part of the National Statuary Hall Collection. It is one of two statues donated by the state of New York.
History.
In 1873, after receiving the commission to create the Livingston statue, Palmer moved to Paris to work on the statue. This was a departure from the usual tendency of American artists of the time to place themselves in Rome, a trend that was to accelerate in the coming years. There he worked on modeling and then casting his work before returning it and himself to the United States. In comparing this statue with others in the collection sculpture historian Wayne Craven noted, “The statue of Livingston, though slightly larger than life, is dwarfed by surrounding giants in marble and bronze, but few can approach it in quality. For many of the other statues, their inadequacies become all the more obvious as they increase in size, whereas the one of Livingston wears well.” 
Webster in his biography and catalogue of Palmer's works reveals that the sculptor first produced a nude study of Livingston (with fig leaf) prior to executing the clothed statue, which was a common practice at the time.
In Paris, Palmer made two casts of the work, one bound for the Capitol, the other for the New York Court of Appeals in Albany. A plaster version was placed in Livingston Hall at the State University of New York at Albany. One of the two versions was exhibited at the Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia and was awarded a first class medal. Since the Exposition was held in 1876 and the statue in Washington was unveiled in 1875, it is likely that it was the Albany statue or the Albany plaster that was shown in Philadelphia.

SS Choctaw

SS "Choctaw" was a steel-hulled American freighter in service between 1892 and 1915, on the Great Lakes of North America. She was a so-called monitor vessel, containing elements of traditional lake freighters and the whaleback ships designed by Alexander McDougall. "Choctaw" was built in 1892 by the Cleveland Shipbuilding Company in Cleveland, Ohio, and was originally owned by the Lake Superior Iron Company. She was sold to the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company in 1894 and spent the rest of her working life with it. On her regular route between Detroit, Escanaba, Marquette, Michigan and Cleveland, Ohio, she carried iron ore downbound, and coal upbound.
In foggy conditions on July 11, 1915, "Choctaw" was upbound for Marquette, Michigan, on Lake Huron with a cargo of coal from Cleveland. East of Presque Isle Light the freighter was rammed by the downbound Canadian canaller "Wahcondah". Although "Choctaw" sank in only 17 minutes, her crew of 22 escaped, and was picked up by "Wahcondah".
For a long time, shipwreck hunters searched for the wreck of "Choctaw" due to her unique design. The wreck was located by a team from the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary on May 23, 2017, almost 102 years after she sank. She was discovered resting in about of water, lying on her starboard side with the bow partially buried in the lake bottom. The wreck was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 10, 2018.
History.
Background.
In 1843, the gunship USS "Michigan", built in Erie, Pennsylvania, became the first iron-hulled vessel built on the Great Lakes. Beginning in the mid-1840s, Canadian companies began importing iron vessels, prefabricated by shipyards in the United Kingdom. However, it would not be until 1862 that the first iron-hulled merchant ship, "Merchant", was built on the Great Lakes. Despite the success of "Merchant", wooden vessels remained preferable to iron ones until the 1880s, due to their inexpensiveness, and the abundance of timber. In the early 1880s, shipyards around the lakes began construction iron ships on a relatively large scale; in 1882, "Onoko", an iron freighter, temporarily became the largest ship on the lakes. In 1884, the first steel freighters were built on the Great Lakes, and by the 1890s, the majority of ships constructed on the lakes were made of steel.
Throughout the 1880s, the iron ore trade on the Great Lakes grew exponentially, primarily due to the increasing size of the lake freighters, and the rise in the number of trips made by ore boats to the ore docks of Lake Superior. As the railways were unable to keep up with the rapid production of iron ore, which was normally destined for foundries in Ohio and Pennsylvania, was transported by bulk freighters. The quantity of iron ore mined from around Lake Superior rose from in 1886, to over in 1890.
Design and construction.
Named after the Choctaw Indian tribe from the southern United States, "Choctaw" was built in 1892, on the banks of the Cuyahoga River by the Cleveland Shipbuilding Company for the Lake Superior Iron Company of Ishpeming, Michigan. Her hull was in length with a beam, and had a hold and water bottom. She had a gross register tonnage of 1573.61 tons and a net register tonnage of 1256.28 tons. 
The vessel had a cutaway stern and seven cargo hatches, and there were no interior bulkheads between the forward collision bulkhead and the engine bulkhead in her stern. "Choctaw" could carry of cargo; when she was fully loaded, she had a draught. She was powered by a triple expansion steam engine, steam for which was provided by two coal-fired Scotch marine boilers. "Choctaw" was one of only three semi-whaleback ships ever built; there was an identical sister ship named "Andaste" and a "near-sister" ship named "Yuma".
Designed by Swedish naval architect Arendt Angstrom, "Choctaw" and "Andaste" had an unusual design. They were steel freighters similar to the iconic whaleback design invented by Captain Alexander McDougall, but unlike whalebacks, they had straight sides and a conventional bow. This combination meant from the waterline upward, their sides sloped inward in a "tumble-home" configuration. Ships with this hybrid design were known as "monitors", "semi-whalebacks" or "straight-backs", and like the true whalebacks, they were vulnerable to getting a wet deck in stormy conditions.
Service history.
"Choctaw" was launched May 25, 1892, as hull number 17 and entered service on June 24, 1892, with the official number 126874. Her regular route was between Detroit, Escanaba, Marquette, Michigan and Cleveland, Ohio. She would carry iron ore while downbound from Escanaba and Marquette for foundries in Detroit and Cleveland, and would carry coal upbound, which would fuel the mining equipment. "Choctaw" made her maiden voyage to Marquette in June 1892. In 1894, she was sold to the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company.
On April 19, 1893, "Choctaw" was travelling on Lake St. Clair when the cylinder head exploded, killing two crew members and injuring another. On May 20, 1896, "Choctaw" collided with the larger steel freighter "L.C. Waldo", which tore a hole in "Choctaw" starboard side; she sank onto a shoal at the Soo Locks. On June 1, 1896, temporary repairs were made to "Choctaw" in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, before she sailed to Cleveland, Ohio.
At around midnight on May 26, 1900, "Choctaw" ran aground near Pointe aux Pins on Lake Superior, near Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. On April 26, 1902, "Choctaw" struck a rock or hit the bottom after being lifted by heavy seas near Marquette, Michigan, and partially sank after reaching the shelter of Marquette Harbour.
"Choctaw" was in Marquette Harbour on November 9, 1913, during that year's Great Lakes Storm when her Captain Charles Fox saw the steel freighter "Henry B. Smith" leave the shelter of the harbour. This would be the last time "Henry B. Smith" was seen afloat; she was one of the twelve ships that were lost during the storm.
Final voyage and collision.
On July 11, 1915, the weather conditions on Lake Huron were very foggy. "Choctaw", under the command of Captain Charles A. Fox, was upbound from Cleveland, Ohio, with a cargo of coal and was bound for Marquette, Michigan. At around 5:30 a.m. "Wahcondah", which was downbound with a cargo of wheat from Fort William, Ontario to Montreal, sighted "Choctaw". The captain of "Wahcondah" ordered the engines of his ship to be reversed but this did not stop "Wahcondah" from slicing into the port side of "Choctaw" between her first and second cargo hatches. After the collision, the captain of "Wahcondah" lost sight of "Choctaw". The crew of "Wahcondah" relocated "Choctaw" after sighting her tall funnel through the heavy fog. Eventually, Captain Fox ordered "Choctaw" lifeboats to be lowered but the vessel sank so quickly some of her crew could not make it to her lifeboats in time and had to jump overboard. The crew of "Choctaw" reached "Wahcondah" in their own lifeboats. Although "Choctaw" sank in only 17 minutes, her entire crew of 22 escaped. "Wahcondah" took the crew of "Choctaw" to Sarnia, Ontario. The approximate location of "Choctaw" sinking was given as east of Presque Isle Light. According to Fox:
We did not see the "Wahcondah" until she was within of us. She caught us on the port side and struck beams or else she would have cut us in two. We put off in the lifeboats as quickly as possible after we knew the ship could not float. The "Choctaw" listed to port and began to go down at the head. Then she righted and began to list to the starboard. As she shifted to starboard her stern rose out of the water and she rolled over, going down bottom side up. We were in the yawl boats about away when she rolled. It sounded as if a million dishes and hundreds of sticks were being broken as the ship rolled over.
The day after she sank, Captain Nelson Brown of the steamer "James H. Reed" spotted "Choctaw" upper cabins floating off Presque Isle, Michigan, and was able to read the ship's name as he approached them. Nine days after "Choctaw" sank, of her cabin and several timbers were discovered north of Middle Island.
Investigation.
After "Choctaw" sank, Cleveland-Cliffs libeled "Wahcondah", claiming she was travelling at an excessive for the conditions, and should be held responsible for the collision. Captain Cornelius Dineen accepted the accusation against his vessel, but claimed that "Choctaw" was also running at full speed, did not maintain a lookout, and accepted "Wahcondah"s passing signal instead of sounding her alarm and reversing. "Choctaw"s crew corroborated her owner's claims. An examination of "Choctaw"s logbook revealed that regardless of fog, she had travelled at full speed throughout the entire year, including at the time of the collision. The judge presiding over the case ruled that "Choctaw" and "Wahcondah" were both at fault. Cleveland-Cliffs appealed the decision, claiming that the judge had no right to overturn the testimony of "Choctaw"s crew based on the logbook details, and argued that not checking a vessel's speed in fog was not a punishable offence. They further argued that "the high-visibility nature of the monitor ship type predicated the lookout to be stationed at the pilothouse", and that even if a lookout was stationed at "Choctaw"s bow, "it would be unlikely for him to communicate with the wheelsman feet away". The court disregarded this plea, stating that: His absence from the ordinary and proper location at the bow cannot be justified for these reasons. We find no evidence of such custom; nor is the ship’s type a sufficient excuse. The sea was smooth, and there would have been no difficulty in standing on the bow turret, and that location, seemingly, would not have been beyond calling distance for making reports.
The court eventually determined that:There is fair probability that they might have avoided this mistake. This view leads to the conclusion that the "Choctaw" should be condemned for the lack of lookout, and that the damages should be divided.
"Choctaw" and her cargo were valued at $125,000 (equivalent to $ in ).
Wreck.
Searches.
"Choctaw" was a highly sought-after shipwreck due to her unique design. Several unsuccessful attempts to locate the ship were made; several of them resulted in the discovery of one or more other wrecks. Shipwreck hunter Stan Stock conducted an independent search for "Choctaw" in 2003; he located the wreck of the schooner "Kyle Spangler" but failed to find "Choctaw". Shipwreck hunters from Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary collaborated with Stock in 2008 to map the wreck of "Kyle Spangler". In August 2008, they partnered with the University of Rhode Island but rather than finding "Choctaw", they located the wreck of the passenger steamer "Messenger".
In 2011, a group consisting of expert shipwreck hunters and high school students tried to locate "Choctaw". Their search effort was charted in a documentary named "Project Shiphunt". Although they failed to locate "Choctaw", they found the wrecks of the steel hulled freighter "Etruria", which sank on the lake after a collision with the steamer "Amasa Stone", and the schooner "M.F. Merrick", which sank in 1889 after a collision with the steamer "Rufus P. Ranney".
Discovery.
Between April and July 2017, Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary collaborated with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Ocean Exploration and Research to test new equipment including unmanned aircraft systems and autonomous underwater vehicles that were designed to search for missing shipwrecks. On May 23, 2017, researchers from Thunder Bay Marine Sanctuary discovered two shipwrecks in the deep waters of Lake Huron, off the coast of Presque Isle, Michigan. The researchers carried out several investigations between June and August; these investigations confirmed the identities of the early wooden hulled freighter "Ohio" and "Choctaw". Both wrecks are in a place known as "Shipwreck Alley", which is a area of the Lake Huron shoreline that holds an estimated 200 shipwrecks. The US Federal Government named the area the nation's first National Freshwater Marine Sanctuary in 2000.
Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary did not announce their discovery until September 1, 2017, and avocational shipwreck hunters continued to search for "Choctaw". On August 13, 2017, independent researcher Dan Fountain found "Choctaw" using a modified fishfinder. On August 20, he returned to the site with veteran shipwreck hunters Ken Merryman and Jerry Eliason to survey the wreck with Eliason's homemade hi-definition drop video system, positively identifying the wreck as "Choctaw."
"Choctaw" today.
The remains of "Choctaw" rest in about of cold, fresh water. When the vessel sank, the captain reported she "settled by the head soon after the collision, but shortly before she disappeared she rolled to starboard and capsized, going down bottom side up". The wreck rests on her starboard side, nearly upside down, with the exposed section of her hull rising at an angle from the lake bottom. The upper level of her stern cabins broke away when she sank, leaving only the weather deck level cabins intact. The wreckage of her pilothouse lies beside her hull. The entire bow, including the section between the first and the second hatch where the collision occurred, is completely buried and only the last three of her seven cargo hatches remain exposed. There is a sizeable debris field surrounding her wreck, with most of the visible artefacts located near her stern.
The wreck of "Choctaw" was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 10, 2018, for its state-level significance in engineering and maritime history.

Green Street House

Green Street House, usually known as Boleyn Castle, was a stately home in East Ham in the modern London Borough of Newham, East London. 
The alternative name derives from the local legend linking the house with Anne Boleyn and from its imposing appearance, notably the castle-like structure called "Anne Boleyn’s Tower" which lay immediately adjacent to Green Street.
The house lay at the southern end of Green Street, from which it takes its name, a street which forms the boundary between West and East Ham. West Ham United's former Boleyn Ground was built immediately to the east of the House and took its name from the alternative name for the house. In its early years the club referred to their new ground as the Boleyn Castle with Boleyn Ground subsequently becoming the usual term.
Origin, and the Boleyn Legend.
The estate was formed in the early 16th-century, perhaps by Richard Breame (d. 1546) a servant of Henry VIII. The local legend is that Anne Boleyn lived there and Henry VIII came there to court her. There is no documentary evidence to support this belief.
Description.
Green Street House was a red-brick building, mostly of two storeys which originally comprised a great hall at right angles to the street with a long range at its west end and a kitchen block at the east end. South of the kitchen block was a staircase wing with a three-storeyed tower east of that. At the north end of the west range, fronting Green Street, was an arched gateway. 
In the late 17th-century the upper parts of the hall, the west range, the kitchen, and staircase wing were partly rebuilt. during the ownership of Sir Jacob and Sir Thomas Garrard. 
In the 18th-century a wing was added east of the tower, and a later addition was made east of the kitchen. Inside the house there was panelling of the late 16th- or early 17th-century, and the main staircase was of the same period. 
In the garden, south of the west wing, was a detached tower, "Anne Boleyn's Tower", which overlooked the street and was the best-known feature of the house. This was an octagonal building of red brick with crenellated parapet and stair-turret. It was built about the middle of the 16th-century, and may originally have been balanced by another tower at the south-east corner of the garden. 
The upper part of the tower was rebuilt by William Morley about 1800. Until the 18th-century a room in the tower was hung with leather embossed with gold, but Morley's predecessor, Mrs. Whiteside, is said to have burnt these hangings and sold the gold. The sale catalogue of 1863 lists all the rooms in the house and its outbuildings, and describes the gardens, which contained several fine cedars. 
When the Roman Catholics bought the house they demolished the gateway and erected a range of buildings, including a church, along Green Street.
Owners and tenants.
It has been suggested that Breame was followed in the late 16th- and early 17th-centuries by the Nevilles whose monument is in St. Mary's church, East Ham. In the 1630s and 1640s the estate seems to have belonged to Sir Henry Holcroft (died circa 1651) a Parliamentarian prominent in Essex during the Civil War, and later to his widow. 
It was acquired about 1653 by Sir Jacob Garrard (Bt.), a London merchant of royalist sympathies who founded an apprenticing charity. Green Street House descended with the baronetcy until the death in 1728 of Sir Nicholas Garrard. Cecilia, widow of Sir Nicholas, retained it until her death in 1753, when it passed to his grandnephew Sir Jacob Downing, Bt. In 1755 Downing conveyed the estate, then comprising about 160 acres, to James Barnard or Bernard (d. 1759). Bernard appears to have been succeeded by Mrs. Whiteside, who was probably his daughter and the estate was partly broken up about this time.
In 1788–1789, Maurice Bernard sold Green Street House and grounds, totalling 17 a., to William Morley. Morley, a London corn merchant, lived there until his death in 1832. The house was subsequently bought by Mr. Henry Lee, for his daughter Mrs. Sarah Morley, who was related to the former owner by marriage. In 1839 James Morley (not her husband but possibly her uncle), owned and occupied the house. The occupation of the site by the different Morley families led to the junction of Green Street and Barking Road, by the Boleyn Tavern, being known as "Morley's Corner".
In 1863, the house and grounds, then comprising 30 a., were advertised for sale. They do not appear to have changed hands then, but in 1869 they were bought from the Morleys by Cardinal Manning, for use as a Roman Catholic reformatory school. After the reformatory was closed the southern part of the site was used for a Roman Catholic church and primary school. 
The house, after being used c. 1907–12 as a maternity home, was leased, with some adjoining land, to the West Ham United football club, which sub-let the house to the Boleyn Castle social club. The social club occupied the house until the Second World War.
After moving into the adjacent Boleyn Ground, West Ham United trained on the grounds of Green Street House, before moving to Chadwell Heath.
Demolition.
Like many stately homes at that time, the house became dilapidated, with bomb damage possibly a factor, and as a result was demolished in 1955.
Legacy.
Until 2016, West Ham United played at the adjacent Boleyn Ground named after the House and the club's badge featured a stylised representation of the House. The ground's West Stand, redeveloped in 2001 included tower features as a stylised tribute to the club's badge and Green Street House itself. The Boleyn Ground was demolished after the 2015–16 season but the Boleyn Tavern, on the Morley's Corner junction with Barking Road remains.
Several nearby street names reflect the presence of the House. Castle Street immediately to the south and the cluster of streets with Tudor themed names a little to the north. Other roads in the immediate north of the site are named after the other wives of King Henry VIII - Parr Road, Cleves Road, Arragon Road, Seymour Road, etc.
After West Ham United left the Boleyn Ground in 2016, archaeologists uncovered foundations of some of the buildings beneath the club’s former carpark.

Elmira and Seneca Lake Railway

The line of the Elmira &amp; Seneca Lake Railway Co. from 
Horseheads, New York to Seneca Lake was 
opened for operation on June 19, 1900.
Route.
 Horseheads was the terminus of the Elmira &amp; Horseheads Railway, over which the cars of the Elmira &amp; Seneca Falls company later entered and left Elmira. The route was on Main Street, in Horseheads, until the Chemung Canal was reached; this canal had been abandoned as a waterway some years before the railway was built, and the towpath was subsequently owned by the railway company as its right of way. The line passed through a well-settled country and the villages of Pine Valley and Millport, and left the private right of way on reaching the town of Montour Falls. Then it proceeded through the main streets of Montour Falls, and along New York State Route 14 to Watkins Glen, and through Watkins Glen to the northern terminus at the lake. The road passed through two counties, Chemung and Schuyler, and directly to the entrances of Watkins Glen State Park at Watkins Glen and Havana Glen Park at Montour Falls. The terminus at Watkins Glen was on the shore of Seneca Lake adjacent to the depot of the Northern Central Railroad Co., and connected with the steam boat lines of the Seneca Lake Transportation Co.
Seneca Lake is a fine body of water about long, and there are a number of summer resorts and cottages along its shores reached by the steamboats.
When this route was projected, it was with many doubts as to the ultimate completion of the road, but the officials of the railway company after thoroughly examining the field decided to award the contract for designing, constructing and equipping the road to the American Engineering Co., of Philadelphia, which immediately prepared plans and specifications and commenced grading for the roadbed. The cuts were wide at grade line with side slopes of 1½ lo 1 and ditches for drainage at the base of the slope; the fills were made at the grade line after being allowed to settle along the private right of way. It was necessary to change the course of the Catharine River at four different points and wherever the river was adjacent to the fills they were protected from washing by oak piles driven apart parallel with the river, with willow mattresses placed between and behind the piling and backed by stone rip rap work.
Wherever the line of road crossed the stream there were erected plate girder or through span steel bridges, which were furnished by the Berlin Bridge Co. and the Havana Bridge Co. The bridges were set on foundations of cut stone laid in Portland cement, none but dimension stones being placed in the faces of the walls. The track over all bridges had inside guard rails of the same section as the running rails, laid parallel to and from them. The bridges had fender pieces with notches on the underside to receive the ties; the fender pieces were held in place by bolts with washers on each end. Exposed parts of ties and also the notches were treated with two coats of red lead to prevent absorption of moisture.
Rails.
The rails were a 56 lb/yard (28 kg/m) T-section rolled by the Carnegie company. They were laid on ties 6x8 in. x 8 ft., of hewn oak and chestnut, spaced 18 in. on centers except at joints, where they are spaced 14 in.; the joints were suspended. The track was surfaced on a bed of 12 in, of creek gravel; stone ballast was filled in level with the tops of the ties, having the natural slope from the ends of the ties. The track was bonded with No. 0000 Morris protected stranded copper bonds, and cross-bonded every 200 ft. Ground plates were buried in the stream, wherever a crossing is made and connected to the track circuit by four No. 00 wires: four wires are used to guard against breakage.
Overhead lines.
The overhead construction was with side poles except through the towns and villages, where the span construction was used. Side poles were in length, at the top, with seamless steel bracket arms supporting clips for suspension wire, having the overhead wire supported from an eyebolt attached to the top of the pole. All suspension and pull-off wire was stranded galvanized iron. The trolley wire was No. 00 grooved section, hung on insulators with the General Electric Co's, special mechanical clip for this pattern of wire.
The feeder system consisted of 13 miles of No. 0000 solid copper wire, insulated in the towns and bare on the private way. It was hung on glass insulators supported by cross arms on the side poles. Lightning arresters were placed every and grounded on to track circuit. 
The telephone signal system was furnished by the Novelty Electric Co., and consisted of a telephone at each of the sidings and terminals. There were also instruments at the power house and office so that a car at any siding could communicate with the power house or office, and with another car through the office, or the office could reach any car on the lines by ringing bells which are placed along the line, bridged in circuit, which notify the car that is wanted. Each telephone was numbered the same as the siding at which it is located, and the system was found to work very satisfactorily.
The road was fenced for its entire length over the private right of way, nearly , with galvanized wire. The fencing was supported on iron posts every and had wooden end and brace posts; the grade crossings were protected by cattle guards made of triangular oak pieces. All farm crossings were put below grade through special cattle passes.
Depot.
The car barn was located parallel to the railway near the power house. It was , and contained four tracks with a shop and the employees' room in the end nearest the power house; the building and pits were heated with exhaust steam from the power house, which was piped underground from the latter. The building and special work leading from it were lighted with enclosed arc lights; the pits and rooms were lighted with incandescent lamps. The sides of the pits were of brick and were built outside of and parallel to the tracks. The tracks were carried over the pits on trestles to allow space at the sides for light and ventilation.
Power house.
The power house was a brick building on a stone foundation laid in cement mortar. The roof was carried in steel trusses and covered with slate, with Ved tile trimmings. The floors of both engine and boiler rooms are of cement.
The engine room equipment comprised one 350-h.p. engine driving a 325-kW generator and one 250-h.p. engine driving a 225-kW generator; the two generators were Westinghouse. Both of these engines were made by the Harrisburg Foundry &amp; Machine Works, of Harrisburg. Pa., and were of the type known as the Harrisburg four-valve self-oiling simple engine. This type was one of a complete series made by the company and has been specially designed to give satisfactory and efficient service under the following conditions: Steady, or if required, varying load; belted or direct connected to the generators; exhaust either free to atmosphere, or, if unavoidable, subjected lo back pressure; steam pressure from 70 to 100 lb; low-priced attendants; units from 75 to 700 h.p.; compact floor space; quiet operation; a water rate from 25 to 28 lb. per hour. The four valves were cylindrical in form and perfectly balanced under all conditions; the two steam valves had removable bushings which render repairs positively reliable. There were two eccentrics, one actuating the two steam valves and one the two exhaust valves, the motion being transmitted to wrist plates by in dependent rocker arms; this design was justified because the arrangement permits a rapid acceleration of the valve gear and secures sharp cut-off and release. The valve gear was made as simple as possible and close adjustment could be secured so that in operation there was no clattering or noisy vibration. The wrist plates and the wrist plate pin were made of a special steel, the pin being lined with adjustable sections of phosphor bronze. Lubrication of the pins was accomplished by means of compression grease cups on the outside end of each pin thus allowing the operator to force the lubricant into use without exposing himself in the least to the mechanism.
The switchboard was of white marble equipped with Keystone and Weston instruments. A detector bell was provided which rang when a circuit breaker opened and continued sounding until the circuit was closed. All wiring from the generators to the switchboard was carried under the engine room floor.
Adjoining the switchboard was the telephone booth and near it were a tool room, a dressing room and the office for the engineers.
The steam piping, which was completed under the direction of Mr. A. C. Thompson, consisted of a main header with a branch for each engine turned from it and a Bundy automatic trap for returning hot water drippings to the boilers.
In the boiler room were two 300-h.p. boilers, an American feed water heater and two Snow pumps. Coal storage pockets were directly in front of the boilers, and coal was deposited in the pockets through a steel-lined chute leading from a railroad siding parallel to the building and some above the pockets. Coal was thus unloaded into the storage pockets without cost for handling. The stack was high: it was of steel, brick lined, and titled with lightning rods.
Water for the plant was secured by damming a branch of Catharine River and laying a pipe with natural gravity flow to a well in the boiler room. Analysis of the water showed it to be first-class for steaming purposes. The water dammed back being on the company's property, it was planned to be used as a resort for picnicking in summer and skating in winter.
Rolling stock.
The car equipment consisted of 12 cars, four of them similar to that used for the formal opening of the line. Two of these four had smoking compartments, the other two had both baggage and smoking compartments. They were equipped with four G. E. 1.000 motors, K-11 controllers, Christenson automatic air brakes, and Wagenhals arc headlights. The interior was finished in cherry and mahogany; the seats were of the walkover pattern, covered with rattan. They were lighted with four five-light clusters of handsome design; these cars were fitted with electric push buttons. Of the other eight cars, six were open 15-bench cars and two closed cars; they were equipped with Westinghouse motors and G. E. K-11 controllers and had Syracuse changeable headlights. The cars were painted Pullman green with gold striping and each had the name of one of the towns on the route as well as the number. All cars had a tool box containing pliers, wrench, and trolley wire pickup for use in case of emergency repairs, or picking up broken trolley wire.
Inauguration.
After the inspection and opening trip those present enjoyed an elaborate banquet at the Rathbun House, Elmira, as guests of the American Engineering Co.
The people along the line of route have shown their appreciation by their generous patronage, the present equipment being taxed to its utmost capacity since the opening of the road.
Personnel.
The officers of the Elmira &amp; Seneca Lake Railway Co. were initially: 
The employees of the company were uniformed in cadet gray; conductors' uniforms were trimmed with gold, the motormen's with silver and other employees' with black. All had cap badges with name of occupation and number in enamel.
Fares.
The fare for the trip from Elmira to Watkins Glen was 35 cents one way; no reduction was made for the round trip.

Susan Williams (artist)

Susan Williams was an American artist. She was born Susan Lewis in Chicago, Illinois. She married architect Frank Williams in the 1960s and had her son David in 1969. She was a fraternal twin (Sandy, her sister was an animal rights activist). Williams got her MFA at New York University, where she initially studied painting, but then moved into three dimensional work. Her time was divided between San Miguel Allende in Mexico where she maintained a home and studio and Craryville, in upstate New York. In 2015, she died of cancer at home in Craryville with her son at her side; her husband, son, and three grandchildren (Anabelle, Dakota, Juliette) survived her.
Williams was an AIR Gallery pioneer and co-founding member. She formed the gallery in 1972 with friend Barbara Zucker in order to increase the promotion of work by female artists. In addition to her sculptures, Williams worked in plexiglas creating furniture and producing standing lamps, tables and chairs that were sold and exhibited. The sculptures she showed early on at AIR were influenced by the furniture and were large, tall transparent plastic containers filled with newsprint. In 1963, Williams and Barbara Zucker met on Monhegan Island. During the 1960s, they shared an artist's studio on lower Broadway, Chinatown and Little Italy. For a brief period they worked to create sculptures and paintings that were mirrors of each other but all these works were destroyed. After leaving the AIR Gallery, Williams also designed silver jewelry for several years. Her late work is composed of graphic, black and white manipulated photographic images.

Ethel Moseley Damon

Ethel Moseley Damon (April 12, 1883 – April 1, 1965) was a teacher, writer and historian who served with the Red Cross in Europe during World War I, and was decorated by Elisabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Belgium and by the Mayor of Le Havre.
Background and education.
She was born April 12, 1883, in Honolulu in the Kingdom of Hawaii, as one of five children of Edward Chenery Damon (1848–1894), a retailer with JT Waterhouse and Company, and Cornelia Beckwith Damon (1857–1908). 
Ethel's brothers and sisters were Julia, Maurice, Fred, and William.
Her maternal grandparents Maurice B. Beckwith (1824–1881) and Sarah Moseley Beckwith (1831–1870) arrived in Hawaii in 1855 from Massachusetts to help run the Royal School. Her paternal grandparents Samuel C. Damon (1815–1885) and Julia Sherman Mills Damon (1817–1890) arrived in Hawaii in 1845 as missionaries for the American Seaman's Friend Society. Samuel was the founding publisher of "The Friend" periodical, and Julia was the first president of the Stranger's Friend Society in Honolulu.
Ethel attended Honolulu's private college preparatory Punahou School, and was Valedictorian at her 1901 graduation. After training at Honolulu Normal school, she taught English at that same institution for a couple of years. She later attended Wellesley College in Massachusetts, receiving her BA degree in 1909. Upon her return to Hawaii, she taught multiple languages at Punahou until the beginning of World War I.
World War I.
With the outbreak of war, Johns Hopkins pediatrician Edwards A. Park, working with the American Red Cross Belgian Commission, headed the Children's Hospital in Le Havre as a facility for refugee Belgian children. He appointed Mabel Isabel Wilcox as head nurse in supervision over Ethel and 14 other nurses.
In a 1918 letter printed in the "Honolulu Star-Bulletin", Ethel related the effects of war on the French population. Quartered at the Hôtel de Ville in Paris, she awaited the arrival of Mabel and Dr. Park. In the interim, she had been working for a district nurse. On the evening of their arrival, Paris was in the middle of an air raid blackout, which they later learned had been one of the most severe air raids in Paris up to that date. They remained in the area providing assistance for several days, as Ethel witnessed cars and trucks parked in the streets, ready to flee on a moment's notice, and the courage of a people facing uncertainty. While visiting a tuberculosis sanitarium at Sceaux outside of Paris, they heard two loud explosions, " ... we looked at once in the direction of Paris to see a great mass of black smoke begin to rise ..." only to find out later the explosions had occurred where they had been working.
At Le Havre, and wherever needed in France, they provided medical care and a safe haven for the children, often putting themselves in harm's way behind enemy lines to assist refugee women. In recognition of their war-time services, Mabel and Ethel were decorated with the Queen Elisabeth Medal by the Queen Elisabeth of Belgium and the Bronze Medal of the City of Le Havre by the Mayor of Le Havre.
Final years.
Ethel had a prolific writing career on a local level. Concentrating on Hawaii's history, she produced historical pageants, wrote plays, books and pamphlets, and published historic papers. She devoted much of her post-World War I years in documenting Hawaii's history. Never married, she died at her Kauai home on April 1, 1965.

Moscadello di Montalcino

Moscadello di Montalcino is a white Italian wine from the Tuscan wine village of Montalcino.
Historical background.
The cultivation of quality Moscadello grapes in Montalcino began during the Renaissance. The Italian oenological historian, Sante Lancerio, who was the wine curator for Pope Paul III, appreciated the characteristics of a golden-looking Moscadello, calling it sweet and pleasant without being excessively sweet. Also, the Italian poet Ugo Foscolo mentioned the dessert wine in one of his letters.
The cultivation of the Moscadello grape vines in Tuscany was almost completely destroyed by the attacks of Phylloxera, and the vineyards were not reconstituted until the end of the 20th century, largely through the use of moscato bianco grapes originating in Piedmont.
In 1984 the region was awarded "Denominazione di origine controllata" (DOC) status. The 2014 vintage of Moscadello di Montalicino produced nearly 7,300 gallons (275 hectoliters) of DOCG designating wine from a planting of approximately .
Recommended matches.
Moscadello di Montalcino, considering its characteristics, is an excellent wine to accompany fruit, desserts or ice cream.

Child soldiers in the American Civil War

Between 250,000 and 420,000 males under 18 were involved in the American Civil War, for the Union and the Confederacy combined. It is estimated that 100,000 Union soldiers were 15 years or younger.
Given the large number of boys and young men in the American Civil War, compared to the number of older men, one author stated that it "might have been called The Boys’ War."
Reasons for joining.
When the surrender of Fort Sumter was announced, men and boys of all ages on both sides of the conflict were eager to enlist. Abraham Lincoln initially only called for 90-day enlistments. However, after the Union army was driven out of Richmond in the disastrous Peninsula campaign, and the Rebel Army began to march on to Washington, Lincoln issued a call for three hundred thousand three-year volunteers.
Boys had many of the same motives for joining the military as their adult counterparts did. In the North, boys felt a desire to set the South straight. In the South, boys wanted to repel the North, whom they viewed as a hostile invader.
A key difference between boys and adults was their attitude towards slavery: in general, boys on both sides had neutral feelings towards slavery. Thus, few were motivated to fight for it or against it.
By and large, the most popular reason boys joined the military was to escape what they viewed as a dull life on the farm. (In 1860 the population of the United States was more than 80% rural.) Nearly all dreamed of coming home as heroes. Almost none imagined the conflict would drag on as long as it did.
Methods of enlistment.
Although the official minimum enlistment age was 18, there were various ways boys got around this.
First, a boys’ appearance often fooled recruiters. It is fairly common, especially for teenage boys, to appear much older than they are. This trick was even easier during the chaos that often occurred at recruiting stations, when new units were hastily formed.
Second, it was easy to lie about one's age, especially given the fact that modern methods of identification (social security, driver's license, computer databases) did not exist. Further, recruiters were anxious to fill recruitment quotas. So, even though they were required to certify on the enlistment papers that they judged the volunteer to be of lawful age, they often turned a blind eye to an underage recruit. Such recruitment passivity increased as the manpower on both sides dwindled and both sides were desperate for more help.&lt;br&gt;One trick was to have an underage recruit write "18" on his shoes and truthfully reply to the recruiter "I am "over" 18."
Third, some underage boys were able to enlist with the endorsement of an adult. Ned Hutter, sixteen years old, joined the Confederate Army in Mississippi. His father vouched for Ned's work ethic and shooting ability. The recruiter then accepted Ned into the unit.
Despite such workarounds, many other boys joined the military legitimately by signing up for non-combat positions. Many such youths signed up as musicians (such as drummer, bugler, flautist). There were places for 40,000 such positions in the Union Armies alone. They often performed other tasks, such as carrying canteens, bandages, and stretchers, to assist surgeons and nurses with the wounded; relaying orders on the battlefield; and at least a few picked up rifles and participated in the fighting.
Conditions.
Food.
Perhaps the most common complaint of boy soldiers during the Civil War was the lack of food. This is because the process for keeping an army fed relied heavily on the delicately perfect timing of many factors, including gathering, loading, and transporting food. If any of these processes were delayed, or if any miscommunications occurred, it could be days or weeks before the army was fed.
Hardtack was a staple food item, to the boys’ chagrin: "After we had been in the field a year or two the call, ‘Fall in for your hard-tack!’ was leisurely responded to by only about a dozen men... Hard-tack was very hard. This I attributed to its great age, for there was a common belief among the boys that our hard-tack had been baked long before the beginning of the Christian era. This opinion was based upon the fact that the letters 'B.C.' were stamped on many, if not, indeed, all the cracker-boxes."
Other staples included pork, coffee, and bread.
Starving boys often devised intricate ways to sneak out of their camps and forage for food. They found food by either gathering it from the local land, or stealing it from local farmers. In the Union Army, some soldiers initially objected to this practice as violating the Ten Commandments. But as the war wore on, it became evident that “such tender regard for Rebel property” strengthened the enemy and weakened the Union cause. Consequently, “conscientious scruples stepped to the rear, and the soldier who had them at the end of the war was a curiosity indeed.” Commanding officers forbade foraging, but often connived it and shared in the spoils.
Clothing.
Clothing was a crude procedure for both armies, especially towards the beginning of the war. Once colors and patterns were agreed upon, uniforms were more easily standardized. However, boys often found themselves in uniforms that were too big. Additionally, many boys continued to grow after being assigned a uniform, and many outgrew their uniforms.
Some units did not have the resources to provide uniforms to boys, so many had to wear their own clothes from home.
As a result, many boys often resorted to stealing uniforms from deceased soldiers, or bartered food and supplies in order to have their clothes tailored by locals.
Marching.
Excitement over enlistment swiftly gave way to the boring routines of camp life and marches.
"Day after day and night after night did we tramp along the rough and dusty roads ‘neath the most broiling sun with which the month of August ever afflicted a soldier; thro’ rivers and their rocky valleys, over mountains—on, on, scarcely stopping to gather the green corn from the fields to serve us for rations... During these marches the men are sometimes unrecognizable on account of the thick coverings of dust which settle upon their hair, eye-brows and beard, filling likewise the mouth, nose, eyes, and ears."
Death, injury, and capture.
Boys were not spared from the horrors of war that their adult counterparts faced, including violent deaths, injuries (and poor medical treatment), and appalling living conditions when captured.
Young soldiers’ romantic illusions about military glory evaporated under the harsh realities of combat. They suffered hunger, fatigue, and discomfort, and gradually lost their innocence in combat. Every aspect of soldiering comes alive in their letters and diaries: the stench of spoiled meat, the deafening sound of cannons, the sight of maimed bodies, and the randomness and anonymity of death.
The accounts of young Union prisoners at Confederate prison camps are especially harrowing. Sixteen-year-old Michael Dougherty was shocked by the sight of “different instruments of torture: stocks, thumb screws, barbed iron collars, shackles, ball and chain. Our prison keepers seemed to handle them with familiarity.” William Smith, a fifteen-year-old soldier in the 14th Illinois Infantry, was shaken by the physical appearance of prisoners at Andersonville in Georgia, a “great mass of gaunt, unnatural-looking beings, soot-begrimes, and clad in filthy trousers."
Michael Dougherty was the only member of his company to survive imprisonment at Andersonville Prison in Georgia.
"No one, except he was there in the prison can form anything like a correct idea of our appearance about this time. We had been in prison nearly five months and our clothing was worn out. A number were entire naked; some would have a ragged shirt and no pants; some had pants and no shirt; another would have shoes and a cap and nothing else. Their flesh was wasted away, leaving the chaffy, weather beaten skin drawn tight over the bones, the hip bones and shoulders standing out. Their faces and exposed parts of their bodies were covered with smoky black soot, from the dense smoke of pitch pine we had hovered over, and our long matted hair was stiff and black with the same substance, which water would have no effect on, and soap was not to be had. I would not attempt to describe the sick and dying, who could now be seen on every side."
Offences and punishments.
Boys also committed the same offenses as their adult counterparts, and their commanding officers did not spare them from punishment.

Notable examples.
Elisha Stockwell, Jr. joined the Union Army at age fifteen. Since this was against his father's wishes, he tricked his father by claiming that he was going to a Dutch dance. He told his sister he'd be back for dinner, but didn't return home for two years. He was in the Union Army for the entire duration of the war, participating in battles such as the Battle of Shiloh, the Siege of Vicksburg, and Sherman's March to the Sea. He survived the war and wrote a memoir of his wartime experiences. His story is cited extensively in the awarding-winning children's book, The Boys’ War.
The most celebrated schoolboy performance of the war was the baptism of fire of the Virginia Military Institute Cadet Corps at the Battle of New Market. The corps was 215 strong when it reached the battle. The boys were eighteen or under (tradition has it that some were only fourteen).
Washington and Lee University provided a company of sixty-four boys in the first days of the Civil War. Their average age was about seventeen, and their average weight was about 130 pounds. Of a total of sixty-five present in the two battles of Manassas, twenty-three were killed or wounded. In the forty battles in which it fought with the 4th Virginia Infantry, the company lost 100 dead or wounded, and forty-six captured, of a total strength of 150 from recruitments.

Rose Chernin

Rose Chernin (September 14, 1901 – September 8, 1995) was a Russian-born naturalized U.S. citizen. She was a member of the Communist Party and became notable for her left-wing activism which eventually led to her arrest in 1951. She was charged with forming a conspiracy to overthrow the government under the Smith Act of 1940 and spent a year in jail. The Immigration and Naturalization Service attempted to deport her, but their efforts were preempted by the 1957 ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States that the Smith Act was unconstitutional.
Personal life.
Rose Chernin was born as Rochelle Chernin in Chasnik, Russia, in 1901. She and three younger sisters migrated to Waterbury, Connecticut with her mother, Perle, in 1913. After finishing grade school, Rose entered Crosby Preparatory School, where she encountered socialist ideas in an activist newspaper. She later attended Hunter College, but dropped out to participate in political activism through the Russian Club.
She married Paul Kusnitz in 1925, and moved to the Bronx where they had their first child, Nina, who would die of Hodgkin's disease in 1944. In 1940, Rose Chernin had her second daughter, Kim Chernin. Paul Kusnitz died in 1967. Rose Chernin died in Los Angeles of Alzheimer's disease in 1995.
Political activities.
Rose was active in local socialist causes including tenant advocacy and rent strikes. After becoming a US citizen in 1929, she joined the Communist Party in 1932, and her family briefly moved to Moscow, where she worked in publishing. She returned to America in 1934 after witnessing the arrest of fourteen communist activists under anti-organizing laws. The family returned to the Bronx. 
After the death of Nina, the family moved to California. In Los Angeles, Chernin began another round of tenant advocacy and other activist work, such as protesting the deportation of British communist writer Henry Carlisle. She would first be threatened with deportation after being accused of participation in the Young Communist League. She also participated in actions on behalf of migrant agricultural workers.
Arrest and release.
Rose Chernin founded the Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born in 1950. In July 1951 she was arrested for conspiracy to overthrow the government with bail set to $100,000. Under the Smith Act of 1940, advocacy for Marxism or Leninism was equated with advocating for the overthrow of the US government. She and other communists were arrested under the law. Chernin was sentenced five years in prison, and subpoenaed to identify conspirators to the House Un-American Committee, which she refused. She was threatened with denaturalization and deportation by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, but the process was abandoned for lack of evidence. In 1957, the Supreme Court overturned Chernin's conviction, deeming the Smith Act of 1940 unconstitutional.

&lt;poem&gt;
In truth were these three rulers, / as I before did say,
Great and high in power, / and homage true had they
Eke of knights the boldest / and best that e'er were known,
Keen men all and valiant, / as they in battle oft had shown.
There was of Tronje Hagen, / and of that princely line
His brother valiant Dankwart; / and eke of Metz Ortwein;
Then further the two margraves, / Gere and Eckewart;
Of Alzei was Volker, / a doughty man of dauntless heart.

Frederick Leonard (activist)

Frederick Leonard is an American activist who was involved in the civil rights movement.
Involvement in the civil rights movement.
Leonard participated in the Nashville sit-ins in 1960 while attending Tennessee State University. He also participated in a Freedom Ride that started on May 17, 1961, and travelled from Nashville to Birmingham. In a 1985 interview with Blackside Inc., which produced "Eyes on the Prize", Leonard elaborated his experience on the Freedom Ride. When the Greyhound bus arrived at the terminal in Montgomery, he recalled "the Klan [came] through with their guns and their robes and everything", but the Freedom Riders felt at ease because they were being escorted by police. As soon as they reached the terminal in Birmingham, he noticed the police had suddenly vanished and the terminal looked deserted and eerie. He said that after he noticed the police were gone, "all of a sudden, just like, whoosh, magic, white people, sticks and bricks [appeared]". The riders were trapped; the bus was surrounded. There was a debate about whether or not to exit the back of the bus so that, " ...it wouldn't be so bad," or to exit the front of the bus and "...take what was coming [to them]." 
Jim Zwerg, a white rider, decided to exit the bus first before everyone else and receive the full brutality of the mob. Leonard believes that Zwerg saved him and the other blacks on that bus. He stated in the Blackside Inc. interview: "I think that's what saved me, Bernard Lafayette, and Allen Cason 'cause Jim Zwerg walked off the bus...and they [the white mob] pulled him in...it's...like they didn't even see the rest of us." After exiting the front of the bus unrecognized, Leonard, Lafayette, and Cason escaped and headed to Fred Shuttlesworth's house in Birmingham to seek safety and shelter.
Personal life.
Leonard was born August 11, 1942. He later married Joy Reagon, who was also a Freedom Rider. After his arrest and the court proceedings that followed, Leonard and his then-wife moved to Detroit to start a new life and later had a child. Leonard went to work at the Chrysler plant before returning to Nashville. He founded his own company selling Afro hair picks out of a building on Jefferson Street in what is now an affluent Germantown neighborhood. The company was successful, selling hair picks to drug stores up and down the Northeast.
Other experiences in the movement.
That same night, after participating in the Freedom Ride, there was a rally at Abernathy's church in Birmingham. All the members of the ride, including Leonard, Lafayette, and Cason, attended the rally. They were cautious because they had heard that the Ku Klux Klan was hunting them like wanted men even though "we [the riders] were the victims." After hearing this, the riders went into the church to hide or disguise themselves. Someone suggested hiding in the choir, and "...[the riders] took off and ran up to the choir and put on little robes and started signing...[the Klan] came in and looked, didn't see [them], and they left."
On May 24, 1961, a few days after the previous Freedom Ride, Leonard and other riders boarded a bus to participate in another Freedom Ride headed for Jackson, Mississippi. There were a lot of police at Jackson's bus terminal. Leonard and the others were allowed to go through the white portion of the bus station, which was rare in Mississippi. After the black riders successfully walked through the white side of the station, the riders were told to continue walking straight into the police car and were escorted to jail. The next day, the riders were sent to court to be sentenced. When attorney Jack Young got up to defend the riders, the judge turned his body to face the wall behind him. When the attorney finished, the local judge turned back around and without a second thought banged his gavel and sentenced the men to 60 days in Parchman State Penitentiary. In "Eyes on the Prize", Leonard stated in his interview that the men and women sang for hours on end in the penitentiary because "...they were only allowed one book and that was the Bible, so we [the Freedom Riders] did a lot of singing."
TSU Freedom Riders honorary degrees.
In 2008, Frederick Leonard and fourteen other Freedom Riders were honored by Tougaloo College (TSU) who had asked fourteen of the Freedom Riders to come to the college and receive honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degrees for choosing expulsion to patriation in Freedom Riders and fighting for the freedom of the black community in 1961. 
The TSU spoke to the Freedom Riders and expressed their gratitude to the Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR) for exemplifying the courage to "right this unforgivable wrong".

Lucile Land Lacy

Alma Lucile Land Lacy (August 18, 1901 — October 29, 1994) was an [American painter and printmaker.
Biography.
A native of Temple, Texas, Lacy was a pupil of Ellen Douglas Stuart and Ella Koepke Mewhinney. She graduated from Baylor Female College with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and attended the New York School of Interior Decoration before receiving a Master of Arts degree from Columbia University in 1940. She began her teaching career as an assistant in her alma mater's art department in 1933; from 1924 until 1931 she was an instructor, and from 1932 until 1944 she headed the department. Upon retirement from the college she studied at the University of Pennsylvania, which led to her licensing as an occupational therapist in 1945. In that year she began work as a therapist at the Old Farms Convalescent Hospital in Avon, Connecticut, continuing for two years. In 1947 she took a position as chief occupational therapist at the Veterans Administration hospital in Temple, and two years later she moved to Houston to occupy the same role, remaining there until 1953. She was active in state and national associations for her profession. Lacy later returned to Temple, where she died. She is buried in that city's Hillcrest Cemetery.
Artwork.
Lacy was a member of numerous artistic organizations during her career, including the Southern States Art League and the Texas Fine Arts Association. In 1939 she was one of eight women who founded the Printmakers Guild, later called Texas Printmakers, to challenge the male-dominated Lone Star Printmakers; the others were Bertha Landers, Stella LaMond, Mary Lightfoot, Verda Ligon, Blanche McVeigh, Coreen May Spellman, and Lura Ann Taylor. From 1942 until 1944 she was president of the Texas Art Education Association. She exhibited her work widely, both in Texas and elsewhere in the United States, and in 1943 was the subject of a one-woman show of prints at the Dallas Museum of Art. A scholarship in her honor at her alma mater, today the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor, was established by former pupil Marjorie Hamilton Gillies. Three of Lacy's prints, the linocut "First Monday" of c. 1935–1940 and the lithographs "Left Side of Tracks", of 1940, and the undated "Summer Blankness", are in the collection of the National Gallery of Art; they are part of the donation made to the museum by Reba and Dave Williams of the Print Research Foundation in 2009.

David Stavens is an American entrepreneur, scientist and co-founder and CEO of Nines, a Silicon Valley teleradiology practice. He was co-founder and CEO of Udacity and a co-creator of Stanley, the winning car of the second driverless car competition of the DARPA Grand Challenge. Stavens has published in the fields of robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
Early life and education.
Stavens grew up in Sioux City, Iowa and attended Princeton University, graduating with a B.S.E. in Computer Science, Magna Cum Laude, at age 19. He is an alumnus of Stanford University's Computer Science department for both M.S. and Ph.D. programs. His Ph.D. was advised by Sebastian Thrun.
Autonomous cars.
Stavens was a co-creator on Stanford’s autonomous car team. The team built Stanley, the winner of the second driverless car competition of the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005. Stanley has been on display in the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History and National Air and Space Museum. Academic publications from the team (by Stavens along with Hendrik Dahlkamp, Adrian Kaehler, Sebastian Thrun, Gary Bradski) state that they applied self-supervised learning, to detect drivable surfaces in the desert for self-driving cars which led the vehicle to win the race. Stavens's publications state that they apply the concept of self-supervised learning to autonomous driving with the benefit of avoiding human intervention. His dissertation states that this self-supervised learning approach has the potential to improve human driving performance. The Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab awarded Stavens a gold medal "For his groundbreaking contributions to the winning DARPA Grand Challenge vehicle..."
The Stanford autonomous driving team ultimately joined Google as the foundation of Google's self-driving car team (Waymo).
Stavens also made contributions to the 2009 NASA Mars Rover Mission.
Indoor WiFi maps.
Stavens also worked on research at Stanford on indoor localization using WiFi signal strength measurements. The goal was to create a system capable of delivering GPS-quality localization indoors, where GPS satellites do not function. He and Jesse Levinson were winners of the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship in 2009 which provided $100,000 in funding for the research.
He published the research along with Joseph Huang, David Millman, Morgan Quigley, Sebastian Thrun, and Alok Aggarwal, stating that it produced excellent results in practice. Joseph Huang went on to found an indoor localization start-up, WifiSLAM, that was acquired by Apple.

John W. Mosley

John W. Mosley (May 19, 1907 – October 1, 1969) was a self-taught photojournalist who extensively documented the everyday activities of the African-American community in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for more than 30 years, a period including both World War II and the civil rights movement. His work was published widely in newspapers and magazines including "The Philadelphia Tribune", "The Pittsburgh Courier" and "Jet" magazine.
Mosley has been called a "cultural warrior" for preserving a record of African-American life in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, one which combats "negative stereotypes and false interpretations of African-American history and culture". 
More than 300,000 of Mosley's photographs are included in the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection at Temple University. Exhibitions of his work have been shown at the Philadelphia International Airport and the Woodmere Art Museum.
Early life.
John W. Mosley was born in 1907 in Lumberton, North Carolina. His father was a Baptist minister and a barber. 
Mosley played football in high school.
He began teaching himself photography with a simple box camera in the 1920s. 
He studied at Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, North Carolina.
In 1934, Mosley moved to Philadelphia as part of the Great Migration. There, he obtained a job as a professional photographer at Barksdale Photography Studio. He later had a darkroom and photographic studio at the Christian Street YMCA.
Photography.
Mosley flourished in his career as a photographer from the 1930s to the 1960s. He was known to photograph as many as four events a day, seven days a week.
He traveled around Philadelphia on public transit, carrying his cameras and other equipment.
Mosley shot in black and white film. He used a large-format Graflex Speed Graphic camera. and a medium-format Rollieflex.
Proud of his heritage, Mosley chose to portray the black community positively at family, social, and cultural events that were part of daily life. He photographed individuals and families at weddings, picnics, churches, segregated beaches, sporting events, concerts, galas, and civil rights protests. During a time of racism and segregation, he emphasized the achievements of black celebrities, athletes, and political leaders.
Among those he photographed were bandleader Duke Ellington, trumpeter Cootie Williams, basketball player Wilt Chamberlain, tennis player Ora Washington, 
Paul Leroy Robeson, Billy Eckstine, Billie Holiday, Martin Luther King Jr., Cecil B. Moore, Marian Anderson, Eleanor Roosevelt, and President Richard Nixon, to name only a few.
Locations he captured included Nixon's Grand Theatre at Broad Street and Montgomery Avenue; the Earle Theatre at 1049 Market Street; Chicken Bone Beach in Atlantic City, Glamour Row, and Club Harlem.
The Pyramid Club was one of many centers of African-American culture and life in Philadelphia which he documented, working as the club's staff photographer for many years. He published an annual album of photographs for the club, the "Pictorial Album of the Pyramid Club". He was also the official photographer of the First African Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia.
Mosley was one of the first black Americans to be a syndicated photographer.
His work was widely published in East-coast African-American newspapers such as "The Philadelphia Tribune" 
the "Philadelphia Evening Bulletin", and "The Pittsburgh Courier" and appeared in "Jet" magazine.
Legacy.
The Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection at Temple University contains more than 300,000 photographs taken by Mosley. Blockson's private collection of materials relating to the history and culture of those of African descent was one of the largest in the United States. Blockson acquired the Mosley photos from Clarence Still and Teresa Still Mosley, John W. Mosley's wife, in 1985.
The curator of the Blockson Collection, 
Diane Turner, emphasizes the importance of Mosley's work in combating "negative stereotypes and false interpretations of African-American history and culture in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania":
Charles L. Blockson wrote a biography of Mosley's life, "The journey of John W. Mosley" (1992).
The exhibition "A Celebration of African-American Life in Philadelphia, 1930's – 1960's: Selected Photographs by John W. Mosley" was shown at the Philadelphia International Airport in 2012.
A retrospective of Mosley's work, "A Million Faces: The Photography of John W. Mosley", appeared at the Woodmere Art Museum in Philadelphia in 2016.

Eastern Orthodoxy in Iraq

Eastern Orthodoxy in Iraq refers to adherents, communities and institutions of Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Iraq. Within the ecclesiastical order of the Eastern Orthodox Church, territory of Iraq traditionally belongs to patrimonial jurisdiction of the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East. The Patriarchate has a diocese in Iraq, the "Eastern Orthodox Archdiocese of Baghdad", headed since 2014 by metropolitan Ghattas Hazim.
History.
The early history of Eastern Orthodoxy in the region of Mesopotamia (within the territory of modern-day Iraq) was marked by frequent Byzantine-Sasanian wars, fought between the 5th and 7th century. During much of that period, major part of Mesopotamia was controlled by the Sassanian Empire (Persia). Official Persian religion was Zoroastrianism, while Christianity was occasionally tolerated or persecuted, depending on the current religious or political climate. Attitudes of Persian rulers towards their Christian subjects was affected mainly by current political relations with the Byzantine Empire, seen by Persians as the rivaling power with considerable and worrying influence on Christian communities within Persian borders. Since Byzantine government generally favored Eastern Orthodoxy over other Christian denominations, local communities of Eastern Orthodox Christians within the Persian borders were often treated with suspicion by Persian authorities, who were slightly more tolerant to other Christian communities. During that period, relations between different Christian groups in Mesopotamia were marked by frequent theological disputes and internal divisions. Religious and political pressure led to the decline of Eastern Orthodoxy in Mesopotamia. During that period, Eastern Orthodox patriarchs of Antioch, centered within the Byzantine borders, had great difficulties in maintaining ties with remaining Eastern Orthodox communities in Mesopotamia. By the time of the Arab conquest of Mesopotamia in the 7th century, Eastern Orthodoxy in that region was reduced to small minority.
During the period of Arab and later Turkish rule in Mesopotamia, from the 7th century up to the end of the First World War, communities of Eastern Orthodox Christians in the region remained under ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch. After the creation of modern Iraq, legal position of Christian communities in the country was much improved. In 1969, Eastern Orthodox Christians in Iraq got a new and able leader, metropolitan Constantine Papastephanou of Baghdad, sent to them by the Patriarchate of Antioch. During his long tenure, internal organization of the Baghdad Archdiocese was much improved. On the other hand, later devastating wars ad conflict in Iraq greatly affected the entire population of the country, including Eastern Orthodox Christians and their religious institutions. In 2014, metropolitan Constantine retired and was succeeded by Ghattas Hazim as the new metropolitan of Baghdad. Since the territory of his Archdiocese were severely affected by previous conflicts, upon arriving in Baghdad new metropolitan was faced with many inherited problems, starting from the fact that over 90% of the Eastern Orthodox Christians in the country were still displaced, as a result of previous wars and internal conflicts in Iraq. Because of that, official seat of the diocese only formally remains in Baghdad, while administrative headquarters are located in neighbouring Kuwait, territorially also under jurisdiction of the Baghdad Archdiocese.

Owen Pick

Owen Pick (born 9 July 1991) is a British war veteran and snowboarder. Pick was injured in 2010 while serving in Afghanistan, losing his right leg. As part of his rehabilitation he was encouraged to try various sports. He subsequently found success in world para-snowboarding events, including representing his country in the Winter Olympics in his sport and as a flag bearer.
Biography.
Pick is originally from Cambridge, United Kingdom. He lost his right leg in January 2010 while serving with the British Army in Afghanistan. He had joined the Royal Anglian Regiment straight after leaving school and was 18 when he stood on an improvised explosive device (IED). The explosion caused significant damage to his leg and doctors battled to save it until Pick decided in August 2011 to have it amputated below the knee. While recovering in hospital Pick watched snowboarding for the first time. The charity Blesma gave him the chance to try wakeboarding and snowboarding and he discovered his talent on the snow in Colorado. Pick was nominated by Blesma and subsequently won the Sporting Excellence prize at the Soldiering On Awards in 2017.
Career.
Pick won a silver medal in the banked slalom SB-LL2 event at the 2017 Para Snowboard World Championships held at the Big White Ski Resort in Canada, followed by two podium finishes at the World Cup in La Molina, Spain.
He represented Great Britain at the 2018 Winter Paralympics, competing in Banked Slalom and SBX events alongside Ben Moore and James Barnes-Miller. Snowboarding was first added to the Paralympics in Sochi 2014, with 2018 being the first time that Great Britain has been represented. Pick describes his pride for being selected: "I feel honoured to be among the first British athletes competing in snowboard", as well as describing himself as the "least experienced snowboarder" in his category. 
Pick was chosen to carry the flag at the opening ceremony, leading the 17-strong team out in the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium. Pick was eliminated in the quarter finals of the Men's snowboard cross SB-LL2.

Kerava–Lahti railway

The Kerava–Lahti railway line or Lahden oikorata (Lahti direct line) is a railway line in southern Finland between the towns of Kerava and Lahti, which opened on 3 September 2006.
History.
In 1990, the Ministry of Transport commissioned a study regarding the construction of a new line connecting Helsinki with eastern Finland, prompted by the capacity problems of the Helsinki–Riihimäki railway. Three main routes for the new connection were proposed: Helsinki–Lahti–Mikkeli, Helsinki–Kouvola, and Helsinki–Kotka–Hamina–Luumäki. All three options were deemed superior to the alternative of simply upgrading the existing lines. The Kotka option was found to be the least economically viable of the three, while those of Lahti and Kouvola were found to be about equal in this respect. The study was completed in 1992, favoring the Lahti option.
The construction of the Kerava–Lahti railway line took four years and cost €331 million. At the time it was the first new passenger railway to be opened in Finland since completion of the Jämsänkoski–Jyväskylä line in 1977, reducing the journey time between Kerava and Lahti by 26 kilometres. Funding was provided by the Finnish government and the European Union, with the route forming part of the EU's "Nordic Triangle" TEN-T strategic transport route.
Services.
The line is used as a shortcut for services from Helsinki to eastern Finnish cities including Kouvola, Kuopio and Joensuu, which all used the line to Riihimäki prior to the construction of the Kerava–Lahti line. The Z train of the Helsinki commuter rail also uses the line.
Future.
Proposals exist to build a similar direct railway line from Helsinki Central to Kouvola via Helsinki Airport and Porvoo (known as Itärata), which would handle traffic to eastern Finnish cities such as Kuopio, Joensuu, Lappeenranta and Mikkeli, providing a shorter journey time between Helsinki and these cities than currently offered by the Kerava-Lahti line.

The Choir of Newman College

The Choir of Newman College is a collegiate chapel and concert Choir affiliated with Newman College, a Catholic residential college of the University of Melbourne. Founded by Dr Gary Ekkel in 2002, the Choir consists of 27 choral scholars drawn predominantly from residents of the college and recent alumni. The Choir participates in a Choral Eucharist at 7pm on Sundays during the University semester as well as singing a Compline service on the first Thursday of each month.
History.
The Choir was established in 2002 under the Rectorship of Fr Peter L’Estrange when Dr Ekkel, who had previously worked with the choir of the nearby Ormond College, approached Newman College with the suggestion of forming a chapel and concert Choir. L’Estrange, a great patron of the Arts at Newman College, agreed and invited Dr Ekkel to form a collegiate choir to contribute to the liturgical and musical life of Newman College.
Since its inception in 2002, the repertoire of the Choir has predominantly focused on sacred music from the Renaissance and Baroque periods as well as 20th century music. Under the Rectorship of Fr Bill Uren, the Choir has transformed from being composed chiefly of non-resident scholars to being mostly resident scholars. Choral scholars of The Choir of Newman College have also gone on to perform in vocal ensembles such as "Schola Cantorum" as well as becoming founding members of "The" "Regional Victorian Byrd Choir".
Concerts and Tours.
Typically, the Choir’s Concert Series consists of three concerts per year performed in the Chapel of the Holy Spirit at Newman College. However, the Choir also regularly sings outside of this concert series in festivals such as the "Organs of the Ballarat Goldfields" where it has performed major works such as Biber’s "Missa Salisburgensis" and Bach’s "St Matthew Passion".
In 2015, the Choir embarked on its first international tour taking Monteverdi’s "1610" Vespers to the New Zealand cities of Auckland, Christchurch, Hamilton, Dunedin, and Oamaru. On this tour, the Choir collaborated with the New Zealand-based early music ensemble "The Affetto Players".
Recordings.
In 2010, the Choir released its first album "Behind Closed Doors" with the Australian viol ensemble, "Consort Eclectus," and the College Organist, David Macfarlane. This album showcases music written and sung by English Catholics during a period “dominated by a more or less consensual and emphatically Protestant regime”, which witnessed the persecution of Catholics and saw Catholic composers such as William Byrd “sail... close to the wind”
In 2018, as part of the centenary celebrations at Newman College, the Choir released the album "Luceat Lux Vestra" featuring music: set to texts written by the patron of the College, Cardinal John Henry Newman; tied to the Jesuit order who administer the College; and linked to the history and key figures of the College.
The Choir has also contributed to the CD "Gallipoli: A Tribute", commissioned to commemorate the centenary of the ANZAC’s Gallipoli campaign.

C/2017 U7

C/2017 U7 is a hyperbolic comet (previously classified as A/2017 U7, a hyperbolic asteroid), first observed on 29 October 2017 by astronomers of the Pan-STARRS facility at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, United States when the object was from the Sun. Despite being discovered only 10 days after interstellar asteroid 1I/'Oumuamua, it was not announced until March 2018 (along with C/2018 C2 (Lemmon), which was believed to be another hyperbolic asteroid at the time) as its orbit is not strongly hyperbolic beyond most Oort Cloud comets. Based on the absolute magnitude of 10.6, it may measure tens of kilometers in diameter. As of August 2018, there is only 1 hyperbolic asteroid known, ʻOumuamua, but hundreds of hyperbolic comets are known.
Orbit.
Although C/2017 U7's orbit is no longer bound to the Solar System, unlike ʻOumuamua, it is probably not an interstellar object. It had an inbound orbital period of roughly 800000 years. Its point of origin is inclined only 3.5 degrees from the galactic plane, but its aphelion points roughly to the Galactic anticenter, so if it did somehow originate from interstellar space with a typical Solar System velocity (which is highly unlikely) it would have been travelling on an unusual orbit directly into the galactic core from beyond the Sun's orbit around the Milky Way.
A barycentric orbit of C/2017 U7, however, shows that it is only a very distant Solar System object, approaching as far as 16,000 ± 1,000 AU from the Sun, around the distance of the Oort Cloud. It had an inbound orbital period of roughly 740,000 years until the current approach to the Solar System, where perturbations show it on an extremely weak hyperbolic trajectory after leaving the planetary region of the Solar System. The barycentric eccentricity increases above 1 starting with an epoch of July 2022, reaching 1.0000088 once it gets beyond planetary perturbations.
, C/2017 U7 is inbound from the Sun. C/2017 U7 makes closest approach to the Sun on 10 September 2019 at a distance of 6.4 AU (outside of Jupiter's orbit). Due to the orbital inclination, on 18 May 2020, the asteroid will be about from Jupiter, generating a peak heliocentric eccentricity at 1.003.

Do What You Wanna Do (album)

Do What You Wanna Do is the fifth studio album by the Masters Apprentices, released in November 1988 on Virgin Records. It was the group's first album in 17 years since "A Toast To Panama Red".
Background.
In the early 1980s there was a revival of interest in the Masters Apprentices due partly to rock historian Glenn A. Baker, who featured the band for his "Rock &amp; Roll Trivia Show" on Sydney radio's Triple J, which in turn led to the release of a definitive compilation LP, "Hands of Time" by Baker's Raven Records in 1981. The classic Burgess, Ford, Keays and Wheatley line-up reformed in August 1987 for a "Back to the 1960s" special on the popular TV variety show "Hey Hey It's Saturday". It marked the first time all four had played together since Wheatley had left in late 1971. They undertook a reunion tour during 1988 and released an album, "Do What You Wanna Do", featuring new material and new versions of their earlier songs.
Content.
The album's first side contains new recordings of original material and two re-recordings of "Turn Up Your Radio" and "Because I Love You" (the band's most popular songs). "Because I Love You" also gained new prominence around that time via its use in a series of advertisements for a well-known brand of jeans; the revamped version of "Because I Love You" peaked at No. 30 on the [[ARIA Charts]. Its Side B is live recordings taken from the 1988 reunion tour.
Track listing.
All songs written by Doug Ford and Jim Keays, except where noted.

Pavao Špirančić

Pavao Špirančić or Sperančić (c. 1400 – 1463) was a Croatian nobleman and the Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia from 1459 to 1463. In the sources he is often mentioned with the nickname "Horvat". He was appointed as Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia by Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus. With Pavao's and Frankopan family's help, the king Matthias tried to consolidate his power in the areas southern of mount Velebit, where Republic of Venice and Ottoman empire posed threat.
Biography.
Pavao Špirančić was born in the first half of the 15th century in Croatia which was in that time under the rule of Hungarian king. In the 1459, he was appointed as Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia by Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus. Špirančić tried to gain support of Republic of Venice and make them an ally against Ottoman empire which posed great threat for his territories and Hungarian kingdom. His attempts were unsuccessful, mainly because of his conquest of city of Klis and surrounding towns and areas, which made him a threat for Venetians and some other Croatian nobles who had their possessions there. He was also perceived as a threat by Bosnian king, who went to the Venetians and proclaimed him as an enemy. He was appointed again as Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia in 1463, together with Stjepan III Frankopan. In the same year, neighboring Kingdom of Bosnia was conquered by Ottoman empire. Last Bosnian king Stephen Tomašević was killed and his wife Marija fled to the Croatian littoral where she was captured by Pavao who was enemy of her husband. As Pavao didn't get the help from Hungarian king, he was forced to ask Venetians for help. Later in the same year, his forces were defeated by Ottoman army and he was captured by the Ottomans where he died in captivity. Marija used that opportunity and fled to the Venetians. Pavao's wife Margareta was mentioned in the sources in the years after as "Banica" or "Princess of Cetina and Klis", but in 1466, Klis was taken by Croatian ban Ivan Thuz of Lak.

Pain Killer (Iceage song)

"Pain Killer" is a single performed by Danish art punk band, Iceage. The single was the second single released on their fourth studio album, "Beyondless". The track has been praised for its jazz influence, featured horns and backing percussion, and its backing guest vocals from American singer, Sky Ferreira.
The single was released on the band's YouTube on 1 March 2018.
Music video.
The song was the only single not to include a music video. Instead the album artwork for "Beyondless" was released, and the audio was released on YouTube.
Critical reception.
The track received widespread acclaim from contemporary music critics. John Norris of "Billboard" described the track as a "driving standout" on the album, and the music as "Tusk-worthy fanfare of horns". Norris overall described the song as a bold move from the band. Evan Rytlewski of "Pitchfork" called the horns and jazz influence of the song "splashy", and felt their performance was bombastic. Rytlewski felt the track allows Iceage "let their pheromones fly, flaunting their seductive new sound like it’s a brand new sports car". In a more mixed review, Stereogum's Gabriela Tully Claymore felt the song was a bit drawn out, but that Sky Ferreira's vocals were a welcome addition.

Ren Pedersen

Ren Michael Pedersen (born "Rene") 4 February 1971 in Atherton, North Queensland, Australia.
Ren is a prominent, international advocate for children's brain cancer research and owner of a long-standing crane hire business in Townsville, North Queensland. After the death of his daughter Amy, from a brain stem cancer known as Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), Ren founded the independent Australian arm of The Cure Starts Now.
In 2012 and 2017 Ren was nominated for Australian of the Year award in recognition of his efforts to fund research into holistic cancer cures, via targeting the most challenging paediatric brain tumours. He was awarded the Rotary International Harris Medal in 2012, Lauren Hill Full Court Press Award in 2017 and Pride of Australia Medal in 2018.
Early life.
Ren's family are direct descendants of pioneering convict settlers, John Warby and Sarah Bently. He is the first born of Ken and Marie (née McMahon) Pedersen in 1971, Ren's family owned Australia's second oldest continually operating hotel, The Royal Hotel, in Herberton, North Queensland. In 1975, following an unfortunate marriage breakdown, Marie moved to Atherton with her two sons.
The family relocated to Ayr, North Qld, in 1978, where Ren completed school at St Francis primary school and later, Ayr High. Ren says his experiences at St Francis Primary School could only be described as "Humiliating... But the cruel, heartless teachers unwittingly created in me a resilience to brutality and an elevated empathy for children in need."
Career.
After successfully completing Senior, Ren immediately left home and became a qualified Horticulturalist with the Burdekin Shire Council.
Moving to Townsville around 1990, Ren started a small landscape gardening business, before accepting an offer to experience professional Rugby League with the Canterbury Bulldogs, then Wests, soon after.
Upon arrival in Sydney early February 1992, Ren also trialled for the famous Randwick Rugby Union club under the pseudonym of "John Keller" and was graded after scoring four tries in a single game during an Open club trial. The offer to play Union was declined.
After serious knee and facial injuries and major operations in 1992 and 1993, Ren was convinced to re-establish first grade credentials with the NRL feeder club Newtown Jets. Although attaining solid employment in Sydney at Port Botany Container Depot, Ren returned to Townsville by 1994, disillusioned with sitting in the stands from injury and fed up with "city life".
After immediately gaining employment as a Stevedore in Townsville, Ren played centre in University's unsuccessful Grand Final tilt on 18 September 1994. Ren credits his greatest achievement in Rugby League as making two complete sets of six tackles in a single game against the Burdekin, earlier that same season.
Ren retired from League soon after, but made a few, uninspiring attempts to rekindle past glories in early 2000s. Eventually making "A" Grade with Teachers Wests Rugby Union and University Rugby League sides in the early 2000s. The heart was strong, but the legs weary.
Ceasing employment at the port in 2004, Patriot Crane Hire was formed in 2005.
Ren has travelled extensively and was married to Sharon (née Moretto) on 5 October 1996, in Central Park, New York City, U.S. They have three children, oldest Jack born in 1997 and Riley rattling the eardrums in 2012. The legacy of middle daughter, Amy Pedersen (2000–2009), has inspired a nation.
Ren's passion for promoting positive health pathways for children is firmly recognised across Australia's media landscape.
A prominent social angler, he's heavily involved in the fishing sector &amp; is a regular contributor to FM radio's famous North Queensland Fishing Show.
Following the death of his beloved princess, Ren formed The Cure Starts Now (Australia) in efforts to honour a promise to Amy that he "Would never give up!" and give future brain tumour children, both in Australia and internationally, a shot at life.
Charity work.
The Cure Starts Now was founded in 2007 by Cincinnati's Keith and Brooke Desserich with Ren Pedersen director of the independent Australian branch of this amazing international organization.
Up to Aug 2019, over $2 million has been directly raised by Ren Pedersen and The Cure Starts Now (Australia) for DIPG brain tumour research, since 2009 inception 
Additionally, Ren has indirectly assisted in acquiring an additional $7.5m (approx.) worth of Australian DIPG/BT research funding via alternate funding streams, i.e. CCIA, NHMRC Grants, etc.
Collective pooling of resources and processes has realized around $12m worth of new international DIPG/BT research via the DIPG Collaborative, of which The Cure Starts Now (Australia) is a Foundational Member.
Ren sits upon the Cure Starts Now's internationally acclaimed Strategic Advisory Council which has overseen the approval of approximately $21M AUD worth of new BT/DIPG research projects in the past decade.

C/2018 C2 (Lemmon)

C/2018 C2 (Lemmon) is a hyperbolic comet (previously classified as A/2018 C2, a hyperbolic asteroid). It was first observed on 5 February 2018 by the Mount Lemmon Survey conducted at the Mount Lemmon Observatory near Tucson, Arizona, in the United States. The discovery was announced on 4 March 2018 along with another hyperbolic object, A/2017 U7. Based on the absolute magnitude of 15.1, it may measure several kilometers in diameter. On 22 March 2018 it was determined to be a hyperbolic comet.
Orbit.
While near perihelion, A/2018 C2's heliocentric orbit is not bound to the Solar System, unlike ʻOumuamua, it is probably not an interstellar object. The heliocentric eccentricity drops below 1 starting with an epoch of July 2022, when it is 12.9 AU from the Sun, making the orbit bound to the Sun before it leaves the planetary region of the Solar System. The more stable barycentric orbit of A/2018 C2, shows that it is only a very distant small Solar System body, approaching as far as 20,000 ± 80,000 AU from the Sun, around the distance of the Oort Cloud. It had an orbital period of roughly 1 million years until the current approach to the Solar System, where perturbations will shorten the orbit drastically to 2,900 ± 1,700 AU, with an orbital period of 55,000 years. These numbers will become better refined as the observation arc becomes longer than 30 days.
, A/2018 C2 is inbound from the Sun. A/2018 C2 makes closest approach to the Sun on 2 June 2018 at a distance of 1.9 AU (outside the orbit of Mars). Since this object out gassed generating a cometary coma while near the inner solar system, it was reclassified as a hyperbolic comet.

Hamamelis japonica, Japanese witch-hazel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Hamamelidaceae, native to Japan but widely cultivated in temperate situations elsewhere. A horizontally spreading, hardy deciduous shrub or small tree, it is notable for the slightly fragrant yellow blooms which clothe its naked branches in the depths of winter through to early spring (usually in January and February). The green leaves follow, and in favourable locations they turn yellow before dropping in autumn.
"H. japonica" is one parent of the hybrid "Hamamelis" × "intermedia", an extremely popular and widespread award-winning garden shrub, whose other parent is "Hamamelis mollis".

Citizens of Poland

The Citizens of Poland (, verbatim "Citizens of the Republic of Poland", "ORP") is an informal civic movement in Poland engaged in pro-democracy actions and anti-fascist movement, opposed to the actions of the government led by the Law and Justice (PiS) party. Citizens of Poland practice non-violent civil disobedience.
"Citizens of Poland" organize protests against monthly gatherings lead by Jarosław Kaczyński, the leader of the Law and Justice party, ostensibly to commemorate the victims of the Smoleńsk airplane catastrophe, protesting against the claim it was a political assassination promoted during these meetings. During one of their demonstrations a Solidarity-era hero Władysław Frasyniuk was accused of assaulting a policeman and later detained. ORP were actively engaged in protests against unconstitutional justice reforms in July 2017. They block extreme right-wing rallies and demand delegalization of organizations promoting rasism and xenophobia.
In January 2018 the movement addressed the opposition parties in Poland demanding open primary elections before regional elections of 2018.
The movement established a network of support, ObyPomoc, for those prosecuted for pro-democracy or anti-fascist activities, arranging pro-bono legal aid. They collect and broadcast information on the police actions and cases against pro-democracy or anti-fascist activists.
History of the movement.
On 5 February 2016, in front of the Presidential Palace in Warsaw, 4 people–Tadeusz Jakrzewski, Paweł Kasprzak, Paweł Wrabec and Tobiasz Budzyński–accused Andrzej Duda, President of the Republic of Poland, of having violated the constitution. They did this by holding up banners containing the words: "We hereby announce that Andrzej Duda is a liar and perjurer". They criticized the pardon granted by the President to Mariusz Kamiński, they appealed to the President to take "oaths from lawfully elected judges of the Constitutional Tribunal". Prior to this, they sent a letter entitled "We renounce obedience to a power which violates the Constitution of the Republic of Poland".
The first counter-monthly demonstration of Obywatele RP was held on 10 March 2016. At that time, this was in the form of pickets organised alongside the monthly celebrations.
On 10 March 2017, activists of the Obywatele RP Movement tried for the first time to block the Smolensk monthly. This was tied to the fact that the Polish Parliament (the Sejm) changed the Law on Assemblies, giving priority for reservation of a venue to cyclical events, such as the Smolensk monthlies. That is when 7 participants of the movement—Paweł Kasprzak, Tadeusz Jakrzewski, Paweł Wrabec, Wojciech Kinasiewicz, Monika Dąbrowska, Michał Korczak, Hanna Frem and Marek Madej-Sierski—sat on the street blocking the march.
On 10 June 2017, Władysław Frasyniuk sat down together with activists from Obywatele RP on the route of the so-called Smolensk monthly. There was pushing and shoving by the police and in the end, police officers carried the counter-demonstrators on to the side. W. Frasyniuk later said in the media that "the policeman was rather aggressive" and that citizens have the right to demonstrate.
The movement organises protests against organisations which propagate fascism and nationalism. On 26 February 2017, representatives of the movement, together with Antifa, protested against the march of the so-called Cursed soldiers, the participants of which held portraits of, among others, Romuald Rajs "Bury" who was responsible for committing murderous acts on the local civilian population.
During the pilgrimage of Polish football fans to the Jasna Góra Monastery on 13 January 2018, about a dozen people from the Obywatele RP movement and Demokratyczna RP (Democratic Republic of Poland), unfolded banners with inscriptions "Christianity is not hatred", "Humanity is my Country" and "Here are the borders of decency". They were attacked by the football fans on the pastures surrounding the monastery.
Obywatele RP together with Front Europejski (European Front) and Wolne Sądy (Free Courts) were architects of the "Europo, nie odpuszczaj" (Europe, don't give up) initiative, aimed at convincing the European Commission to take the Law on the Polish Supreme Court to the EU Court of Justice. The initiative involved demonstrations, petitions, and letters of support.
Goals and tasks.
The movement adopted peaceful civil disobedience as a method of its actions.
The movement runs a group called ObyPomoc (To Help)—people that provide legal support to the movement. ObyPomoc publishes periodical reports based on submitted information regarding court cases against the demonstrators.
On 19 November 2017, during the press conference organised by representatives of Obywatele RP, the Warsaw Women’s Strike, Citizens in Solidarity in Action and ODnowa, activists presented a report "on the actions of State forces against persons objecting against the unconstitutional acts of those in power, the logging of the Białowieża Forest and the fascism in public life in Poland". In their opinion, the police is using excessive force against civilian people for their participation in legal protests, and does not react, inter alia, during the "Independence March" to people carrying banners bearing radical slogans.
In January 2018, the movement approached the "coalition of democratic parties" demanding to hold "open primary local self-government elections": "We hear from some parties, social movements and media that »first, the PiS Party needs to be removed from power, and only after that, to deal with other matters«. We tell them today: we want democracy now! That is why we demand a coalition of »democratic« parties, and holding open primaries preceding the local self-government elections. Open, meaning such during which parties let the voters decide about the lists" – wrote P. Kasprzak in the "Rzeczpospolita" daily newspaper.

Cabaon

Cabaon was a Berber chief of Tripolitania in the beginning of the sixth century, known essentially by a rather long passage in the Vandal War of Procopius.
During the reign of Thrasamund, for unspecified reasons, the Vandals launched an expedition against Cabaon. Although not himself a Christian, the Moorish leader then decided, according to Procopius, to send spies on the backs of the Vandals to repair the damage that the Arian fanatics would cause to the buildings of the worship. The ensuing battle in an unknown place was a disaster for Thrasamund's troops, baffled by Berber tactics. In a pattern that would be repeated later, they took shelter behind a rampart of camels and fought on foot, essentially making use of ranged weapons that decimated the Vandals squadrons. The battle seemed to be a resounding success for the Berbers, but the immediate consequences were unknown because Procopius never mentioned Cabaon again, and no link was established between that battle and the long Moorish Wars later. The episode, however, had a rather rich historiographic posterity. The Byzantine compilers were fascinated by the paradoxical respect shown by Cabaon towards Catholic worship; the latter of which interested Evagrius, and led him to copy the passage from Procopius in his Ecclesiastical History.

Sawtooth Building

The Sawtooth Building is a historic 1913 brick and steel industrial structure in Berkeley, California which was built to serve as the West Coast manufacturing headquarters of the Kawneer Manufacturing Co.. It gets its name from the saw-tooth roof form of its design.
The Sawtooth Building is located at 2547 Eighth Street, between Dwight Way and Parker Street. The building was constructed for the Kawneer Manufacturing Company founder, Swedish born cabinet-maker, architect, inventor, machinist, and businessman Francis John Plym (1869–1940). The aluminum storefront products of the Kawneer Manufacturing Company are considered to have revolutionized storefront design and influenced the appearance of retail and commercial building design around the world. 
The structure's primary distinguishing features are large clerestory windows built into twenty saw-tooth-shaped roof bays; these stretch the entire width of the building. These are considered early precursors to the glass-curtain designs that dominated later twentieth century office buildings.
Additions were made between 1947 and 1950, including an office structure on Dwight Way employing the company's own products from the middle of the twentieth century. It was described as "...one of Berkeley’s most artistic manufacturing plants, which is used as a model for industry in many places."
The building was eventually purchased by the Sealy Mattress Co. in 1959; the firm continued operations there up to 1972. The site was then purchased by A.J. Bernard, and divided into 35 smaller spaces for sublease to small industries, craftspeople, artisans, artists, performance spaces and a school.

Vann Van Diepen

Vann Van Diepen is a former United States civil servant who worked in a variety of positions in the United States Department of State.
Van Diepen received a B.A. degree in international studies from American University and a S.M. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He began his career in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research as a Soviet military analyst, and later held positions managing chemical and biological weapons nonproliferation initiatives, and ballistic missile threat reduction programs, for the U.S. State Department. In 2006 he moved to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, returning to the State Department in 2009 as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Nonproliferation. 
Van Diepen was a major contributor to a 2007 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on the nuclear weapons program of Iran, which some said underestimated Iranian nuclear capabilities and which was criticized by neoconservatives as being politicized and reflective of former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell's preference for negotiation over confrontation with Iran over nuclear issues. The charges of politicization against Van Diepen and the other report authors were rejected by Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney and by Flynt Leverett.
Until late 2011, Van Diepen spent two years as acting Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Non-Proliferation, but was never nominated to the post on a permanent basis due to doubts by the Obama presidency as to whether the United States Senate would confirm his appointment owing to continuing concerns by some Republican senators over the 2007 NIE. While acting as Assistant Secretary of State he confronted Ukrainian officials over allegations they had been supplying South Sudan with T-72 main battle tanks which, according to diplomatic cables, led to a "commotion on the Ukrainian side".
In 2016 Van Diepen was decorated with the Presidential Rank Award of Distinguished Senior Professional. He retired from the State Department in December 2016.

Dohori ( or ) is a type of Nepali Folk song usually sung by two teams of men and women. It is in the form of question and answer where a team sings a question and the opponent replies through an equally lyrical impromptu couplet and vice versa. The term "Dohori", means 'back and forth' and refers to the exchange of lyrical phrases between the contesting singers. The song production is collaborative and involves many individuals.
Like all Nepali Folk Songs, Dohori originated in the rural areas of Nepal and now is sung in both rural and urban settlements alike and is quite popular amongst the Nepali speaking diaspora in the UK, US, and Bahrain. The men and women sit on opposite sides and the goal is to keep improvising until one team runs out of witty answers. The Dohori is said to have stretched to seven days and nights during the past.

International Peace Corps Secretariat

The International Peace Corps Secretariat, now known as International Secretariat for Volunteer Service (ISVS), was created by the United States to encourage and assist other countries interested in replicating the Peace Corps idea for their own country. 
History.
In October 1962, the United States hosted forty-three nations at a conference on volunteer service (the "International Conference on Middle Level Manpower") chaired by Vice-President Lyndon Johnson in Puerto Rico. At the conference the Secretariat was called for and forty-one of the forty-three countries at the conference joined. It commenced operations soon there after in January 1963. On May 9, 1963, the Directors and Chief Administrators of the International Peace Corps Secretariat met in the White House Cabinet Room and President John F. Kennedy shared his hope that the exchange of ideas between the members of different countries will strengthen the United States Peace Corps and stimulate humanitarian work in developing nations. Eventually eighteen countries had volunteers serving abroad. 
When more countries began to fund the work of the Secretariat in 1964, it was renamed the International Secretariat for Volunteer Service (ISVS) with a focus on promoting volunteer services for development around the world. William A. Delano served as the first Secretary General of ISVS.
Leadership.
From 1962 to 1964, Richard N. Goodwin served as the Director of the Secretariat.

Ponte Girevole

The Ponte Girevole is a swing bridge in Taranto, Italy, spanning the navigation canal between Taranto's Mar Grande and the Mar Piccolo. The bridge connects Borgo Antico (Old Town) island to the Borgo Nuovo (new Town) peninsula. The canal was excavated in 1481 as part of the defenses of Taranto. A steel and wood bridge was first built across the canal in 1886. The present steel bridge was built in 1958. Officially titled the Ponte di San Francesco di Paola, the bridge has two swing spans that pivot near the banks of the canal to meet in the middle of the canal. When open, the halves are parallel to the embankment, leaving the width of the canal clear for passage. The bridge is a Taranto landmark.
The canal is long and wide. The first bridge was hydraulically operated using water stored in the Castello Aragonese. The 1958 replacement was designed by the National Society of Savigliano and built in the former Tosi shipyard in Taranto. It was inaugurated on 10 March 1958 by Italian president Giovanni Gronchi. The new bridge is electrically operated from control stations on each embankment. The sequence of operation requires the Old Town span to open to 45 degrees first, then the New Town span opens 90 degrees, and finally the Old Town span opens to its full 90 degrees.

Quake (soundtrack)

Quake is the soundtrack album to the 1996 id Software video game of the same name, composed by Trent Reznor and his industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails. Originally pressed on the same disc as the game, "Quake" was otherwise commercially unavailable until its release on vinyl in September 2020. Reznor also provided sound effects for the game.
Recording and release.
The collaboration between Nine Inch Nails and id Software occurred strictly due to a mutual admiration for each other's work; Reznor provided his services to "Quake" completely free of charge.
A vinyl LP edition of the soundtrack was released in 2020.
Composition and content.
Aside from the first relatively driving track, "Quake" is a predominantly ambient soundtrack, and was Reznor's first experimentation with the genre. He would later go on to win an Academy Award for his ambient soundtrack work. The music on "Quake" has been described as dark, immersive, and intended to accentuate the game's oppressive tone. The music is often called "subtle", "disturbing", and "hair-raising". About the soundtrack, Reznor said, "it is not music, it's textures and ambiences and whirling machine noises and stuff. We tried to make the most sinister, depressive, scary, frightening kind of thing [...] It's been fun."
Critical reception.
The "Quake" official soundtrack received positive reception, with many appreciating how the music builds upon the game's atmosphere. In his 1996 review of the game for "GameSpot", Trent Ward wrote, "Simply put, this is the best soundtrack ever created for a computer game." Ward went on to write about how the eerie sounds and unsettling background noises heighten the game's already tense atmosphere. Major Mike of "GamePro" said that "With harsh, rockin' guitar riffs, and creepy low-key synthesizers, the music goes perfectly with each level and thoroughly enhances the overall atmosphere." Writing for "Destructoid", Peter Glagowski said, "Not only did it show that the industry was moving beyond being targeted solely at children, but it pushed the action of its game into overdrive."

Bertha Landers

Bertha Mae Landers (1911–1996) was an American painter and printmaker.
A native of Winnsboro, Texas, where she was raised, Landers graduated from Sul Ross State Teachers College in 1931 with a bachelor's degree in art. She studied at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center and at the Art Students League of New York, at the latter working under the tutelage of Reginald Marsh. Further lessons occurred under Olin Travis at the Dallas Art Institute and with Henry Varnum Poor and Arnold Blanch. Long employed by the Dallas Public Library, she founded its audiovisual department in 1942. She began to be active in California in the 1930s, while still living in Dallas, and later settled in the state. In Escondido, in 1956, she founded Landers Film and Video Reviews; she died in San Diego.
Landers belonged to a number of artistic organizations during her career, including the Southern States Art League, Southern Printmakers, and the Texas Fine Arts Association; she was a charter member of the National Museum of Women in the Arts. In 1939 she was one of eight women who founded the Printmakers Guild, later called Texas Printmakers, to challenge the male-dominated Lone Star Printmakers; the others were Lucile Land Lacy, Stella Lamond, Mary Lightfoot, Verda Ligon, Blanche McVeigh, Coreen Mary Spellman, and Lura Ann Taylor. During her career, she exhibited widely in Texas and California, showing work at venues elsewhere in the United States as well. In 1940 she held a one-woman show at the Dallas Museum of Art. That institution owns a gouache by her, "Forgotten", as well as an etching and aquatint, "Market Day", and nine lithographs. Four more prints, the 1946 screenprint "Ad Infinitum" and three lithographs are owned by the National Gallery of Art; they are part of the donation made to the museum by Reba and Dave Williams of the Print Research Foundation in 2009. The 1914 lithograph "Mexican Funeral" is held by the Library of Congress. Works by Landers may also be found in the collections of the San Antonio Museum of Art, Southern Methodist University, and the University of Texas.

The Five Fox Festival in Japan

The Five Fox Festival in Japan (stylized as THE FIVE FOX FESTIVAL in JAPAN) was a Japanese concert tour by Japanese band Babymetal. The tour ran from July 18, 2017 to October 15, 2017, taking place in Japan, and commenced after the band served a series of opening acts for various bands from 2016 to 2017.
Background.
After the conclusion of the , the band supported Red Hot Chili Peppers, Metallica, Guns N' Roses, and Korn on their world tours as an opening act for several of their shows. On June 16, 2017, the band performed in a standalone headlining show in Los Angeles, to an audience of 4,000 people at The Palladium, where they debuted the live performance of the international exclusive song "From Dusk Till Dawn".
The tour has been subtitled in the band's lore as Metal Resistance Episode V. The first tour dates were announced on April 2, 2017 with shows subtitled Black Fox Festival, Red Fox Festival, Gold Fox Festival, Silver Fox Festival, and White Fox Festival, each with their requirements for attendance. Tickets were made available for pre-sale to "The One" members on April 1, 2017 and to Japanese audiences April 12, 2017. For international audiences, they were given out in a lottery from April 29 to May 9, 2017. On May 29, 2017, in response to tickets for the tour selling out, the band confirmed another leg, titled Big Fox Festival in Japan (stylized as BIG FOX FESTIVAL in JAPAN), adding four more shows. Tickets were made available to international audiences for presale on July 20, 2017, and via lottery on July 28, 2017 (with winners announced the following day).
The first performances of the tour running from July 18 to July 20, 2017 were located at Akasaka Blitz, the same venue where was held over four years ago. During the tour, the band also took part in Summer Sonic Festival in Osaka and Tokyo on August 19 and 20, respectively.
When asked for the reason for starting the tour, Su-metal explained that they set those events in music clubs to be able to see their fans up close, and Moametal said that she had wanted to perform in front of different audiences.
Controversy.
According to the band, anyone who was unable to meet the requirements for attendance would be refused admittance to the show. The restrictions received a mixed response, with some considering it a potential innovation for concert tours in the future, or fascinating due to a potential culture gap. Others, particularly international audiences who won tickets via lottery, complained that it was unfair to be barred from shows due to not being in the correct age range. Fans have also found the age range set for the Silver Fox Festival, specifically for elementary school students and adults above the age of sixty, unusual.
Broadcast and recording.
The shows on October 14 and October 15, 2017 were recorded and set to stream via Wowow on April 14, 2018. Five shows from The Five Fox Festival in Japan and one from Big Fox Festival in Japan have been recorded and released as "The One" fanclub-exclusive box sets in early 2018.
Set list.
This setlist is representative of the show on August 30, 2017 in Osaka, Japan at Zepp Osaka Bayside. It does not represent all dates throughout the tour.
Video releases.

The Chosen 500 (stylized as THE CHOSEN 500) released on January 20, 2018, and The Fox Festivals in Japan 2017: The Five Fox Festival &amp; Big Fox Festival (stylized as THE FOX FESTIVALS IN JAPAN 2017 - THE FIVE FOX FESTIVAL &amp; BIG FOX FESTIVAL -) was released on February 14, 2018.
Background.
"The Chosen 500" was announced on September 22, 2017, and released exclusively to a select five hundred "The One" fanclub members on January 20, 2018.
The set included footage from the first five shows of The Five Fox Festival in Japan as well as a set of colored fox masks.

The Central Telephone Exchange, Melbourne is a building in Central Melbourne, Australia, constructed between May 1907 and early 1909 by the Reinforced Concrete &amp; Monier Pipe Construction Co. headed by engineer Sir John Monash, and designed by architect Samuel Charles Brittingham. The building includes an early example of a reinforced concrete saw-tooth roof.
The building was commissioned by the Public Works Department of the Commonwealth of Australia to house the new telephone service, which came under the recently formed Post Master Geenral's Department following Federation of the Australian Colonies in 1901. the contract for construction was let in February 1908.
The Lonsdale Street facade of the exchange was a two-storey Italianate style office block with stone facing with a long, narrow, three-storey building behind. This housed the exchange plant. The design employed reinforced concrete suspended floors supported on the load-bearing brick masonry walls and a centre row of reinforced concrete columns.
The building was the scene of the Australian novel "Murder In The Telephone Exchange" by June Wright (1919-2012).

Kalyanam is a 2018 Malayalam romantic-comedy film written and directed by Rajesh Nair. It stars newcomers Varsha Bollamma and Shravan Mukesh, son of the Malayalam film actor, Mukesh. The film was released on 23 February 2018.
Plot.
Sarath (Sravan Mukesh), the only son of Prabhakaran (Sreenivasan) is madly in love with his childhood friend Shari (Varsha), the only daughter of their neighbor Sahadevan Nair (Mukesh). As they grow up it becomes difficult for Sarath to somehow convey his feelings to her, despite both of them meeting frequently. Moreover Shari's dad wants to marry her off to a "Nair" boy according to their tradition. Sarath is always accompanied by his friend Saiju (Gregory) and his too young uncle Avesh (Hareesh Kanaran). They spend most of the day at a garage owned by Sundaran (Dharmajan). Sarath observes that Varkey (Indrans), an aged worker in the garage is often visited by a drunkard man (Anil Nedumangad) who keeps coming to the garage for the sake of scolding Varkey, who always gives a deaf ear to it. No one knows the reason or relation between them.
Later, Shari's parents arrange a bridegroom for her which saddens Sarath which leads to comical situations. It ends up with the three of them being caught by the police, though released later. Varkey is again scolded by the drunken man, and Sarath asks him why he is scolded. Varkey reveals that the drunken man was the one who liked Varkey's daughter a lot, and wanted to marry her. But Varkey objected, due to the guy being from a different religion. He also marries the girl off to a suitable family. But the girl got killed few days later, thus saddening both Varkey and the man.
Hearing the story and also witnessing Shari accompanying her would-be home, Sarath is disheartened and attempts suicide by standing on a railway track. But he is stopped by his parents, and he discloses about his love to them for the first time. Prabhakaran says that they would have arranged for it had he told about it earlier. Now that it is too late, Sarath is advised by his father to forget everything. While at Shari's home on the day before the marriage, he unintentionally goes to Shari's room, where he sees objects from their childhood which she preserved. Upon meeting her, she confesses to him that she liked him a lot since childhood, but didn't talk about it as he apparently showed no interest. Now that both of them had confessed their liking for each other, Shari says its too late for both of them. She says it was Sarath's father who disapproved their marriage. Sarath meets Sahadevan, who makes it clear that he wasn't interested in their relationship right from their childhood, so he was the one who lied to her.
Knowing all these, Prabhakaran decides to confront Sahadevan who brutally rejected his son. After Prabhakaran enters Sahadevan's room, Sarath's friends eagerly wait outside and see Prabhakaran coming out after sometime. He asks Sarath to be ready for his marriage the next day. The next day, to everyone's surprise, Sarath marries Shari in the same planned time. Sarath and his friends are eager to know how Prabhakaran made things possible. He reveals that it was Shari's master plan, by faking a suicide attempt if Sahadevan doesn't allow her marriage with Sarath. Thus Sarath realises how much Shari loves him, and confesses that his feelings were nothing before that of her.
Release.
"The Times of India" gave the film a rating of two-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote that "The fact that the director has chosen to infuse the film with clichés can still be pushed to the backseat, had there been an element of novelty that would trigger some curiosity among the audience". "Manorama Online" gave the film the same review and praised the performances of the lead cast.

The elections were the first to take place since the Congolese government has fragmented the former 11 provinces into 26 as mandated by the DRC constitution, though by the time elections occurred only 21 provinces had completed the reform process. In most of the provinces, the elected governors are members or affiliates of the Alliance of the Presidential Majority.
Initially, the Constitutional Court ruled that President Joseph Kabila could appointed interim governors. They went on to organize elections in their regions. The Congolese opposition largely boycotted the elections or were excluded from them.

Guilford (railway point), British Columbia

Guilford station was southeast of Penny on the northeast side of the Fraser River in central British Columbia. No roads, only railway access, the previous small community to its northwest has now completely vanished.
History.
Railway.
Guilford, like Lindup to its northwest, and Bend to its southeast, was an original train station (1914) on the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (the Canadian National Railway after nationalization) (CNR). Guilford station existed at Mile 65.6, Fraser Subdivision (about Mile 155 during the line's construction). The chosen name, a surname of pre 7th century origins, derives either from the city of Guildford, or from residence at a ford where golden flowers grew. It was selected from the list prepared by Josiah Wedgwood (submitted at the request of William P. Hinton, the railway's general manager). Commonly claimed as an English place name, no such location with the different spelling appears to have existed in the United Kingdom. However an earldom was created, and the station name, like some US Guilford localities, may have come from a member of that nobility branch.
To benefit from both river and railway access, the mill and settlement were about northwest of the station, but the latter's isolation gravitated passengers to the Penny station. In September 1913, the Sykes family, later at Penny, travelled by construction train to the planned Guilford station on track laid early that month. The family settled due south, across the river, and Ada Sykes' diary provides one of the earliest surviving references to Guilford's existence. In 1914, a landslide around Mile 66.5 (previously Mile 156), delayed passenger services by a day. Apart from a recluse, only the section (track maintenance) crew lived at the station locality.
In 1960, a speeder collided with a work train in the vicinity, killing Shirley Howard Scott (1905–60), one of the two CNR riders. Two years later, a bull moose, which charged an eastbound 59-car freight train near Guilford, derailed the caboose. The incident delayed the westbound passenger train by four hours.
Built in 1914, the standard-design Plan 100‐152 (Bohi's Type E) station building was replaced with a converted freight shed in 1950. Although Bohi notes the demolition of the former in 1950 and the latter in 1968, it appears more likely that the CNR burned down the former in the early 1960s.
Pioneer Farming &amp; Forestry.
Ole (1882–1956) &amp; Halvor (1891–1973) Mellos, brothers, arrived by scow in 1913, while the railway was still under construction. Emma (c.1897–1942) and Ole married in 1914. The pioneer farmers, who were joined by their sister, Ingeborg L. Mellos (1884–1952), all relocated to neighbouring Penny in 1927.
In 1920, fire totally destroyed the shingle and lath mill, which had operated at least since 1918. Gordon Bain (likely c.1884–?) had recently purchased the mill from A. H. Booth (likely c.1884–1947). Trading as the Red Cedar Mill, its infrequent advertisements for cedar products became weekly during the fire sale. The district forester subsequently seized the fire-damaged equipment to settle unpaid timber royalties.
The narrow strip of accessible spruce forest bordering the railway that stretched some east of Prince George was known as the East Line. A 1927 forest fire spreading between Longworth and Guilford inflicted limited timber losses. Months later, in the vicinity of Guilford, a falling tree fractured the skull of logger John Johnson (c.1889–1927), who succumbed to his injuries while aboard a freight train en route to hospital. A year later, Asbjorn Fremstad (Framstad alternate spelling) (c.1908–1928) suffered similar fatal injuries when decking logs at the Melrose Camp near Guilford. The Vick Brothers Lumber Co., known to have operated a 20,000-foot per shift capacity mill 1926–29, was a victim of the Great Depression. During 1927–29, Archie McLarty had a 20-man crew producing 100 cedar poles per day in the vicinity. Fire destroyed 7,000 of these poles, worth $30,000, stacked near the station.
Guilford Lumber Co..
The acquired assets of Vick Brothers were relaunched as Guilford Lumber Co. in 1939. Herb O. Vick (c.1883–?) owned, and Douglas (Doug) L. Abernethy (1909–83) managed, the sawmill. The following year, they were charged with the theft of logs, owned by Red Mountain Lumber of Penny, that had been passing their log boom on the Fraser River. Remanded to a higher court, the defendants were found not guilty. In 1941, Abernethy and Frank Belanger, his logging camp foreman, bought new logging equipment in Vancouver. Months later, Belanger changed employers and moved his family to Bend, the same month as the Abernethy family moved into their new six-roomed house. The following spring, Abernethy was fined for a violation of the Wage Act, and mill worker John Babich lost two fingers when his mitt caught in the rollers. That year, two carloads of surplus machinery were shipped from Hutton. 
In 1943, Charles Howarth (1885–1994) of Calgary, who managed the Hutton mill during the 1920s, purchased the Guilford one, with Doug Abernethy remaining as manager. The next year, logger Gustave Peterson (c.1886–1944) died in a work-related accident around Mile 61. The Guilford logging camp at Mile 61.4 comprised several windowless bunkhouses, a cookhouse, and horse barn. Another camp existed at Mile 62.5, where the then unmarried Frank Wagner worked 1943-44, and during a subsequent winter.
Clarence Riggs (1933–45) of Penny, employed as a flunky in the mill cookhouse, slipped while walking on the log boom. The Fraser River was unsuccessfully dragged, but the body was found by Joseph Kobra of Penny 12 days later in the millpond at Penny. The deceased was transported by rail to Prince George for the funeral. In recognition of Clarence belonging to the recently formed Penny Scout troop, the pallbearers were Prince George Boy Scouts in full uniform, as were other attendees.
Guilford Sawmills was subsequently fined for violating the control of employment of children provisions. Months later, in an unrelated incident, the company was fined for contravening the National Selective Service regulations.
In 1947, the mill resumed operations after a new boiler plant was installed. The replacement mill engineer was joined by his family, and a new bookkeeper commenced in the office. The Howarths, the owners, were residents from 1948 until the mill closed permanently the following year. Initially, the horses were sold, then the equipment from the 25,000-foot capacity mill was advertised. The boilers and planers remained unsold, but H. Liere acquired the sawmill, which he shipped to Babine Lake.
Charles Howarth died at 108 in Calgary. His wife Jessie lived to 101, making them the only husband-and-wife centenarians on the centenarians' list for West Kootenay-Boundary. He contacted typhoid in 1918, quit smoking in the late 1940s, and retained a sharp mind into his later years.
Community.
A store and mail collection point opened prior to 1920, however the latter was short lived and recipients thereafter collected their mail from Penny. In 1945, the Guilford population comprised 47 family units, likely its peak. Owing to the limited social opportunities, residents attended the dances at Penny, and the wives, such as Irene Abernethy (1907–86), Mary Parranto, and Marie Wagner, participated in the women's functions at that location. Occasionally, the Penny women would visit Guilford.
Commuters often rode bicycles adapted for railway line travel, which were prone to jump the track on bends. Authorized employees regularly used the sawmill's motorized speeder for shopping, collecting the mail or social visits to Penny. Usually braking in time, on three known occasions, it collided with oncoming trains. Frances Wilson, Penny school teacher 1943–45, ruptured her appendix on leaping from the speeder during one close encounter.
Philip (1904–90) &amp; Mary (1908–65) Parranto were residents. Their children were Gordon (1927–74), Theodore (Ted) (1928–92), Anna Mae (1933–83), Fern Marie, and Jim (fostered). Steam engineer Philip relocated for work to Prince George in 1945, but the family remained. The younger ones attended school in Penny. Gordon and Ted worked for the mill, but Ted came and went with work. Borrowed without permission, and hurriedly abandoned on the main line near Penny, the speeder was ejected from the rails on colliding with a train. Gordon, the offender, was sentenced to three months imprisonment or a $100 fine. The daughters relocated on marriage, but Fern's first one was short lived. The family had left the area before the mid-1950s.
Millwright Frank Wagner (1906–90), wife Marie (1912–2000), and her daughter Kaye, became the sole residents and caretakers. Except when a cougar was on the prowl, Kaye walked alone to school in Penny. After graduating high school in Prince George, she left in 1953. When the Wagners relocated in 1956, they created a ghost town.
Fortin Sawmill.
In 1959, Frank Fortin (1927–2019) from Ferndale bought the Mile 61.4 camp from the government. He burned the dilapidated buildings, and constructed a sawmill, garage, cookhouse, bunkhouse, and finally the family houses. Beginning production in December 1959, the output soon increased to 30,000-35,000 feet daily. After burning down in a March 1960 fire, the mill was rebuilt.
The mill's generating plant supplied electricity for the whole community until 10:00 p.m. each evening. Having electricity and running cold water in the two-bedroomed family houses was an uncommon luxury compared with many East Line communities. The camp comprised four families with children and about a dozen men. An ice skating rink in winter, and a large above ground pool, bikes and swings in summer, provided entertainment for the children, while correspondence courses satisfied their schooling requirements.
With passenger trains arriving in the middle of the night, a lantern placed upon the track alerted the locomotive engineer to passengers huddled in the simple shelter at the flag stop.

Ron Nixon is an American journalist. He was the homeland security correspondent for "The New York Times", and the author of "Selling Apartheid: South Africa’s Global Propaganda War". He joined the Associated Press as international investigations editor in early 2019, and was promoted to global investigations editor in March of that year.
In early 2015, Ron Nixon, along with Nikole Hannah-Jones, Corey Johnson, and Topher Sanders, began dreaming of creating the Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting. This organization was launched in Memphis, Tennessee, in 2016, with the purpose of promoting investigative journalism, which is the least common type of reporting. Following in the footsteps of Ida B. Wells, this society encourages minority journalists to expose injustices perpetuated by the government and defend people who are susceptible to being taken advantage of. This organization was created with much support from the Open Society Foundations, Ford Foundation, and CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. In 2021, Ron Nixon was named the inaugural News Leader of the Year by News Leaders Association.

2018 New Zealand Derby

The 2018 New Zealand Derby was a horse race which took place at Ellerslie Racecourse on Saturday 3 March 2018. It was the 143rd running of the New Zealand Derby, and it was won by Vin De Dance.
Vin De Dance was offered at the New Zealand Bloodstock Ready to Run Sale as a two-year-old, but was passed in. A sale was later negotiated for $70,000, with breeder Luigi Muollo retaining a share alongside new owners OTI Racing and the Kilted Taniwha Syndicate.
The son of Roc de Cambes was sent to the Cambridge stable of Hall of Famer Murray Baker and his training partner Andrew Forsman. The team has won multiple New Zealand training premierships, and guided Mongolian Khan to victory in the 2015 New Zealand Derby.
Vin De Dance made a winning debut at Pukekohe in early September, then was placed in two subsequent appearances at Te Rapa. He was sent to Melbourne, where he finished third at Flemington and fifth in the Moonee Valley Vase.
Withdrawn from the Victoria Derby and given several months off to strengthen and develop, Vin De Dance returned with fourth and sixth placings over 1400 and 1600 metres in late January and early February. He moved into Derby contention with a fighting third in the Avondale Guineas.
The fifth favourite for the Derby at $9.90, Vin De Dance was handy throughout the 2400-metre race and loomed as a major threat around the home turn. He hit the lead inside the last 200 metres, but was joined by Mongolianconqueror in a desperate two-horse battle to the finish that Vin De Dance won by a nose.
OTI Racing's Terry Henderson described the New Zealand Derby win as the fulfilment of a long-held dream.
It was the first Derby win for jockey Jason Waddell.
Mongolianconqueror's trainers Stephen Autridge and Jamie Richards came up a mere nose short of winning the Derby two years in a row, having won the 2017 running with Gingernuts.

Sambhudhan Phonglo

Sambhudhan Phonglo (16 March (Saturday) 1850 – 12 February 1883) was an Indian independent freedom fighter who fought against British colonial power in Assam.
The village Dihur Phonglo, which existed on the bank of the river of Mahur (Dihur) was named after Sambhudhan Phonglo. A tank known as Sambhudhan-ni-dikhor, meaning Sambhudhan's tank, also existed on the river.
His descendants still reside in Cachar, Assam.
Early life.
Phonglo was born in Longkhor near Maibang in the North Cachar Hills of what is today the Dima Hasao District. He was born reportedly on the Falgoon of Indian almanac. His father was Deprondao Phonglo and mother Khasaidi Phonglo. they had four younger brothers: Umakant, Ramakant, Ramcharan (alias Ramren) and Haisholong.
Phonglo spent his childhood at Longkhor, later moving over to Gonjung. Afterwards, he moved to Saupra, a small village near Nanadisa. As a young man, he moved to Semdikhor, near Mahur, where he married to Nasadi. Phoglo was reportedly tall, of fair complexion, with black eyes and large ears.
Opposition to British.
In 1832, the British took control of Southern Cachar, and in 1854 Northern Cachar. Instead of combining the two territories, they annexed them to the district of Nagaon. The territory was then placed under the charge of a Junior Political Officer with headquarters at Asalu. In 1866, the territory was distributed between the districts of Nagaon and Naga Hills. Thus, while parts of the Diyung Valley and the Kopili Valley had been given to the district of Nowgong, a large portion was joined with the newly created district of Naga Hills. The rest formed the territory of the North Cachar Hills comprising exclusively the hilly region.
Phonglo opposed these moved. He felt that the British had no right to rule the people of Assam and that the territorial moves were intended to weaken them. Phonglo took the view that if the native people were going to lose freedom, then shouldn't they help the foreign power in consolidating its position. To lose freedom was to embrace slavery. It would not be worthwhile for them to live under the aliens as slaves, as hardships could be endured, but not slavery.
Insurrection.
Phonglo decided to foment a rebellion against the British. He toured extensively in the North Cachar Hills, encouraging mass resistance, making contacts, and organizing followers. He was able to recruit a large number of youths to form a revolutionary force. Phonglo appointed Man Singh as his Principal Adviser and Molongthong a Subordinate Commander.
Phonglo started training his insurgents in Maibang. Villagers voluntarily rendered their services to the training center. Recruits were brought to Maibang in batches of thirty to forty.

Castello Aragonese (Taranto)

The Castello Aragonese is a fortification in Taranto, Italy. Officially called the Castel San Angelo, it was built on the site of older fortifications dating to Greek occupation in the third and fourth centuries BC. In 1481 the low ground in front of the fortification site was excavated to allow the passage of boats, and to create a moated defensive position. The present fortress was built for the then-king of Naples, Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1496 to reinforce the naturally low-lying link between the old town of Taranto on a peninsula, and the mainland. The seven-towered design is attributed to Francesco di Giorgio Martini of Siena. The fortress repelled an Ottoman attack in 1594, but it quickly lost its military significance with the advent of artillery. It was converted to an artillery platform and many interior spaces were filled in to provide a stable base for the guns. In 1707 under the Habsburgs it was converted to a prison however during the Napoleonic period it reverted to its original function as a military fortress. French generals Thomas-Alexandre Dumas and Jean-Baptiste Felix de Manscourt du Rozoy were the most illustrious prisoners of the castle having been taken prisoner in 1799 by the pro-Bourbon Sanfedismi when their damaged ship sought refuge at Taranto Harbour. At the time, Taranto was part of the Kingdom of Naples.
In 1883 the San Angelo tower was demolished to allow construction of the Ponte Girevole, and two others were removed to allow the widening of the canal. Since 1883 the fort has been occupied by the Italian Navy. Beginning in 2003 the Navy began restoration and archeological work on the site, removing plasterwork and investigating fortification work dating back to the Byzantine era. The fort is open for tours.

Lynching of George Taylor

George Taylor was an African-American man who was lynched on November 5, 1918, after he was accused of raping a white woman named Ruby Rogers in her home near Rolesville, North Carolina, United States, about northeast of Raleigh. Described in the press as a "genuine old-fashioned lynching", it is the only known lynching in Wake County, North Carolina. The lynching was commemorated on its anniversary, 2018.
Events.
The assault took place on October 30, 1918 while Ruby's husband, Leonidus "Lee" Rogers, a prominent farmer in the community, was away in Rolesville for business. Ruby Rogers was home with her infant son. She later said that an African-American man entered her home, threatened her with a knife, and assaulted (raped) her before leaving the home. Mrs. Rogers was examined by a physician who confirmed the assault.
Over the next few days, police brought at least three African-American men to Mrs. Rogers to review as suspects, but she did not identify any as her assailant. The three men were each released. Tensions in Rolesville continued to grow among the whites, and law enforcement had to avert a mob who tried to take one of the suspects. On November 5, local law enforcement received a tip that George Taylor, an African-American man, had visited a friend in the Rolesville area on the day of the assault. He was arrested in nearby Wilson, North Carolina and brought to the Rogers' farm. Initially, Mrs. Rogers denied that he was the assailant, but after asking him to repeat phrases which she said were used in the attack, she confirmed that he was her attacker.
Police placed Taylor in a motor vehicle and started to the county seat of Raleigh to begin processing the arrest. But before they left the Rogers property, they encountered four masked men carrying firearms. These men stopped the vehicle and dragged Taylor into nearby woods. Police found Taylor's body the next morning near the woods. He had been "badly gashed and tortured before death", shot more than 100 times, and hanged upside down by his feet from a tree. "His back and sides were sliced by knife after his death.”
An inquiry followed to identify those involved in the lynching. More than 30 people were interviewed, both black and white. As was typical in lynching cases, no suspects were ever named and no one was ever charged. According to the "Durham Herald", "the witnesses...are displaying either unparalleled ignorance of the doings in their community, or are champion forgetters."

Anagnostaras (; 1760 in Poliani – May 8, 1825 in Sphacteria) was a Greek revolutionary, a leading member of the Filiki Etaireia, and later a general and War Minister of the Greek War of Independence. Anagnostaras is a nom de guerre, he was born as Christos Papageorgiou () and signed as Anagnostis Papageorgiou ().

Anagnostaras was born in 1760 at the village of Poliani in Messenia; his family originated from the Leontari area of Arcadia. In Russo-Turkish War of 1787-1792, he appeared in the Ionian Islands, together with Christoforos Perraivos and Tzanetos Grigorakis, to serve with the rank of major under the commands of the Greek-Russian general Emmanouil Papadopoulos. In 1803 he moved to the island Zakynthos and starting his military service in the Imperial Russian Army until 1813, when he demobilized and moved to Odessa to ask his arrears of salary.

At Odessa in 1817, he was initiated into the Filiki Etaireia by Nikolaos Skoufas, became a "priest" and in March 1817 he was sent to Moscow to meet Athanasios Tsakalov, who sent him to the islands of Hydra and Spetses to search for "neophyte" members. Later in the same year went to Constantinople, were found Papaflessas and initiated him on 21 June 1818, then returned to Zakynthos and initiated Theodoros Kolokotronis on 1 December 1818.
Later he was sent to the Peloponnese to continue his activity, in which paradoxically he used a bouzouki to sing poems of Rigas Feraios and songs of Klephts. The result of his tour was to be elected to the higher grade of "Apostle". Emmanuil Xanthos gave to Anagnostaras the code number 108 for correspondence with the other members of society. He was the first initiated Apostle of the Etaireia, after him were initiated Christoforos Perraivos, Yiannis Pharmakis and Elias Chrysospathis.
Service in the Greek War of Independence.
When the Greek War of Independence began in March 1821, Anagnostaras was present at the Liberation of Kalamata on 23 March 1821, when Greek irregular revolutionary forces took control of the city after the surrender of the Ottoman garrison, without fighting, as a Major under the command of Petrobey Mavromichalis. On 30 September 1821, along with Theodoros Kolokotronis, Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis and Panagiotis Giatrakos, he signed an agreement to confirm the position of the Peloponnesian Senate's members, and they came to rupture with Alexandros Ypsilantis, who eventually retreated. Anagnostaras was promoted to General and became member of the War Commission.
In March 1822, Anagnostaras along with Panagiotis Kefalas and Giatrakos' family supported Georgios Kountouriotis to form a new government at Myloi. In May 1822, after the reshuffles of Second National Assembly at Astros, he became War Minister of the provisional Greek Government.
He fought in the Battle of Valtetsi (May 12, 1821), the Siege of Tripolitsa (September 1821), the Siege of Corinth (December 1821 – January 1822) and many other battles until 8 May 1825 when he was killed in the Battle of Sphacteria.

Synopsis.
Monarchists and Republicans confront themselves in Araruna, a small fictional town in the interior of São Paulo, in 1886, two years before the promulgation of the Lei Áurea. Sinhá Moça's love story (Lucélia Santos), the daughter of Colonel Ferreira, the baron of Araruna (Rubens de Falco), a slave, and the submissive Cândida (Elaine Cristina), with the young dr. Rodolfo Garcia Fontes (Marcos Paulo), an active Republican abolitionist, before the difficulties of the campaign for the abolition of the slavery.
The two meet on the train, when Sinhá Moça, after finishing her studies in the city of São Paulo, returns to Araruna. Like Rodolfo, she has abolitionist ideas and criticizes her father's attitudes, fighting for blacks. Sinhá Moça, along with Rodolfo and other abolitionists, invades slave quarters at night, freeing the Negroes and giving them to abolitionist associations, which guide them towards freedom.
On the other side of the story is Dimas (Raymundo de Souza) (who is actually the boy Rafael, ex-freed slave) and his stubborn struggle to destroy the Baron, his true father with the slave of the farm Maria das Dores (Dhu Moraes). Before being sold by the Baron, Rafael was a close friend of Sinhá Moça, with whom he spent his childhood. After being emancipated, he takes the name Dimas and becomes the right hand of the typographer Augusto (Luiz Carlos Arutin), a convicted abolitionist, arousing love in Juliana (Luciana Braga), his granddaughter.

Mir (Calixto García)

Mir is a Cuban village and "consejo popular" ("people's council", i.e. hamlet) of the municipality of Calixto García, in Holguín Province. In 2011 it had a population of 6,647.
History.
The village was founded on December 6, 1902, following the construction of the central railway ("Ferrocarril Central") Havana-Santiago, that crosses it in the middle. Previously, it was a rural locality named Aguada Ciego de la Rioja.
Geography.
Mir spans on a plain next to some scattered hills and close to the border with Las Tunas Province. It lies between the cities of Holguín (47 km east), Las Tunas (51 km west) and Bayamo (53 km south); and is 15 km from the town of Buenaventura, the municipal seat of Calixto García.
It is 8 km from Sabanazo, 13 from Omaja, 16 from Maceo, 42 from Cacocum and 43 from Holguín-Frank País Airport.
Transport.
The village is served by a railway station on the Havana-Santa Clara-Camagüey-Santiago line, the principal one of the country. It is linked with a provincial road to the "Carretera Central" highway (10 km north); and the planned extension of the A1 motorway, not yet finalized in Holguín Province, should pass close to Mir and Buenaventura.

United Nations Water Conference

The United Nations Water Conference took place on March 14, 1977 in Mar Del Plata, Argentina. The conference was addressed by President Jorge Rafael Videla.
Common problems in water scarce countries.
The amount of water available to an area is dependent on its climate and position in the global water cycle. Dominance of water-rich temperate countries has overlooked the fact that water is a finite resource. High water stress is a serious problem growing season is short and recurrent droughts make irrigation necessary for food supply to be attained. The increasing threat of famine and drought in Africa is cause for global concern.
Major water problems occur in temperate zones due to ignorance or neglect. For example, water pollution has surpassed itself as a regional issue to a global issue. In tropical and sub-tropical climates, they face different problems. The tropical climate makes countries more vulnerable to floods, droughts, and land degradation (desertification). In other climates, such as humid, wet climates in Southeast Asia, supply large amounts of water into the ground. Human practices like irrigation have taken important nutrients from the soil and deplete the nature around it. Climate issues in different climates are much more far reaching to be more of a global concern.
United Nations Water Conference.
The United Nations Water Conference was the first intergovernmental meeting on problems ensuring adequate water supply for the future. Delegates from 105 countries, as well as intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, were also present. Its purpose was to avoid a water crisis at the end of the century. There was need for extensive improvements in food and crop yields.
A set of ten resolutions were made directed at United Nations agencies, governments, and the international community overall. These ten resolutions including: assessment of water resources, community water supply, agricultural water use, research and development of industrial technologies, the role of water in combating desertification, technical co-operation among developing countries, river commissions in international river basins, institutional arrangements for international co-operation in the water sector, financing arrangements for international co-operation in the water sector, and water policies in the occupied territories.
Action Plan.
At the United Nations Water Conference in 1977, the first Action Plan was created recognizing that, “all peoples, whatever their stage of development and social and economic conditions, have the right to have access to drinking water in quantities and of a quality equal to their basic needs.”
"January 1992:" International Conference on Water and Sustainable Development - Dublin..
Principal 4 of the Dublin Conference stated that, “it is vital to recognize the basic right of all human beings to have access to clean water and sanitation at an affordable price.”
"June 1992:" United Nations Conference on Environment and Development - Rio.
Chapter 18 or Agenda 21 endorsed the resolution from the Mar del Plata Water Conference of 1977 saying that it was “the commonly agreed premise.”
"September 1994:" United Nations International Conference on Population and Development.
The Programme of Action from the UN International Conference on Population and Development confirms that all individuals, “have the right to an adequate standard of living for themselves and their families, including adequate food, clothing, housing, water, and sanitation.”
"November 2002:" General Comment No. 15. The Right to Water.
General Comment 15 of the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural rights (ICESCR) confirmed the right to water in international law. Within that the is, Article 11 allows for the right to an adequate standard of living, and Article 12 the right to the highest attainable standard of health.
Article I.1 states that “the human right to water is indispensable for leading a life of human dignity. It is a prerequisite for the realization of other human rights.”
"July 2005:" Draft Guidelines for the Realization of the Right to Drinking Water and Sanitation..
These draft guidelines were intended to assist government policymakers, international agencies and members of civil society working in the water and sanitation sector to implement the right to drinking water and sanitation. These guidelines do not legally define the right to water and sanitation, but provide a guide for its implementation.
"July 2010:" UN General Assembly Resolution.
UN Resolution formally recognizes the right to water and sanitation and acknowledges they are essential for human rights. The Resolution calls upon States and international organizations to provide financial resources and technology, especially to developing countries, to provide safe, clean, accessible, and affordable drinking water and sanitation for all Water is a human right for everyone to have.
Effectiveness of the Action Plan.
For most UN conferences, there is a follow-up conference ten years later. While there was the Water Conference which main focus was the “Improved Efficiency in the Management of Water Resources” in 1987. They spoke on improving the use of financial, technological, and human resources. This small, inter-regional was not done on a bigger scale due to the lack of single UN-body in charge of implementing the Action Plan made at Mar del Plata. Many groups have complained that “many problems are still in need of suitable action.” Finally, thirteen years later the UN began implementing the Mar del Plata Action Plan in the 1990s. An assessment was done for the different economic regions in need of water where programs were required. Many programs they created were ignored until the 2000s, like serving every man, woman, and child with acceptable drinking water.
There were many reasons the Action Plan was not successful. One such reason was the broadness with which it was written. For example, rather than referring to different countries who have different climates, they just referred to them as “countries.” On the country level, governments had to make tough economic decisions, prioritizing the most urgent problems. When the UN body allowed steering councils to make decisions on where to fix issues, they based their decisions on their budget plans. Finally, there was no timeline created on when these issues were going to be solved and the drought and famine problems have only gotten worse since 1977. the people are in the land of canaan.
Today.
The Zaragoza Conference was held in 2012 in Rio de Janeiro was focused on “The Future We Want.” They talked about sustainability of natural resources, and the development of business, civil society, and governments".
Water Quality.
WASH has widened the ambition of the water agenda to include water waste management and protecting ecosystem. Use of water is growing at twice the rate of population growth and ways to manage wastewater, treatment, and reuse. Wastewater can be collected, treated, and recycled to some extent.
Water Challenges.
Today has expanded beyond water and sanitation to include hygiene, household, and beyond the household: Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH). It also addresses concern with safety, equality, and sustainability. Advances made have unequally distributed in many countries, especially Sub-Saharan Africa.
WASH created the new 2015 objectives:
Implementation Challenges.
Forty-six countries still have more than 50% of their population without improved sanitation and there are at least 800 million people still drinking water contaminated with feces. Disparities of water are at the base of all inequalities in poor countries. The Sustainable Development Goal for Water is in the range of the resources, the human and social capacities and the technologies available. These challenges can be combatted by increasing finance to allow benefits to come up in front while also improving the use of financial resources already available. The use of low-cost science and technology that will increase efficiency in water provision and use in industry, agriculture, and energy production. These technologies must be adaptable to the scale and capacity of local conditions.

Khải Định Thông Bảo

The Khải Định Thông Bảo (Hán tự: 啓定通寶) was a French Indochinese sapèque coin produced from 1921 until 1933, the design of the coin was round with a square hole that was used for stringing them together. Khải Định became King of Annam in 1916 the funding for the production of new cash coins was reduced by the Hanoi Mint which lead to the demand of the Vietnamese market for low value denominations to not be met, furthermore, after Hanoi reduced funding for the Thanh Hóa Mint, which until that time was producing enough low denomination cast cash coins to meet the market's demands, which caused most, but not all, of the production of cash coins at the mint to cease in 1920. In response a new committee was formed in Hanoi which ordered the creation of machine-struck Khải Định Thông Bảo cash coins, these are the first machine-struck four character Thông Bảo (通寶) coins in Vietnam with the reigning emperor's name as the French government had prior tried to introduce a Cochinchinese 2 sapèque coin that continued under French Indochina that weighed 2.05 grams and had a nominal value of piastre, later the colonial government of the French Protectorate of Tonkin had unsuccessfully tried to introduce a zinc milled sapèque produced by the Paris Mint with a nominal value of piastre from 1905 until 1906. Unlike the earlier attempts at producing machine-struck cash coins by the colonial French authorities the Khải Định Thông Bảo proved to be much more successful as the first series had a production of 27,629,000 coins while the second series greatly exceeded this with around 200,000,000 coins produced in Huế, Haiphong, and Hanoi. The Khải Định Thông Bảo continued to be produced long after the death of Emperor Khải Định under his successor Bảo Đại until it was phased out by the Bảo Đại Thông Bảo (保大通寶) in 1933.
Because the machine-struck Khải Định Thông Bảo cash coins were heavier than the earlier milled 2 sapèques produced by the Paris Mint, they were likely valued at piastre. A number of the machine-struck cash coins were produced by "Poinsard &amp; Veyret Comptoirs D’Extrême-Orient" in Hải Phòng, French Tonkin. While the Hanoi-made coins were struck by the Banque de l'Indochine.
The inscription "Khải Định Thông Bảo" was also used for non-cash coins produced under the reign of Emperor Khải Định for tiền (錢) and lạng (兩) coins made from silver and gold, respectively. Although more commonly the inscription "Khải Định Niên Tạo" (啓定年造) was used for silver ingots (sycees).

APSI focuses on research, public outreach, and collaboration with other similar minded parties.
APSI is a virtual and international institute operating through free interaction between scientists. It is run by Finnish planetologists and its headquarters is located at the Arctic Circle in Rovaniemi, Finnish Lapland (hence the name).
The institute was formed in 2013 and officially registered in Finland in 2015. Currently (2018) it has 12 scientists operating in three countries.
Science.
Research in APSI is not restricted to specific topics. Current projects include:
The institute has its own scientific contribution series. As of March 2018, there are nine APSI contributions.
In 2016 APSI saved NASA's Nordic Regional Planetary Image Facility by moving the materials to Lappajärvi. Previously the NRPIF was situated at University of Oulu.
Insignia.
In the APSI insignia design, the lighter sphere represents Earth and the darker one other solid surface bodies in the Solar system. The curved line represents information flow towards Earth. The relative sizes of the spheres correspond to those of Earth and Mars, with the bulge at the end of the curved line corresponding to the relative size of the dwarf planet Pluto. The line transecting the top of both Earth and the acronym "APSi" represents the northern polar circle.

Sister Serpents

Sister Serpents was a radical feminist art collective that began as a small group women in Chicago in the summer of 1989, as a direct response to the Webster v. Reproductive Health Services Supreme Court decision. They continued their work through 1998.
Mission and manifesto.
Their goal as a collective was to empower women and to increase awareness of women’s issues through radical art. Sister Serpents' public manifesto stated:“SisterSerpents proclaims an end to women’s acceptance of their own oppression. SisterSerpents is fierce and uncompromising, refusing to plead or gently persuade. We recognize and confront the misogyny that exists deep within society…Our struggle hopes to bring the demise of the system that allows for our brutalization… We involve ourselves with idea warfare, instead of the physical and emotional violence which has so long been used upon us… We bare our ideological fangs for the purpose of shocking… Our work is done anonymously… SisterSerpents has no modesty."Founding member Jeramy Turner stated, “The purpose of SisterSerpents is to use art as a weapon to battle against misogyny.” Members of the group were adamant that they were not a political organization; they sought to use art as a weapon for social change, but not in the context of being hired to make posters for political organizations. The work of Sister Serpents was described by some as "militant"; members of this group unabashedly sought to make men feel oppressed by encountering their art.
Members.
The group worked anonymously, with loose membership and no affiliation with any formal institutions. In order to become involved, women had to agree that art was the main focus of the group's work, and that all artistic work created by the collective should aim to attack misogyny. Two of the only members who were publicly named were founding members Jeramy Turner and Mary Ellen Croteau. Their Chicago-based group expanded and by 1991 included chapters in San Francisco, Atlanta, Cleveland, Seattle, New York, and Hamburg, Germany.
Artwork.
Sister Serpents used posters, art, and stickers to convey their feminist protest message. Many of their posters were created to be produced in multiples and wheat pasted in public spaces, out of a desire to make their message seen in the streets, and included messages such as "Rapists are the Boys Next Door." One feminist pro-choice poster by the group was printed in "Industrial Worker." Bright stickers included the "Tips for men" series, with messages such as “tips for men: don’t rape”. Stickers were created to be put over advertisements, with slogans such as “This sells rape. Don’t buy it.” and “Misogyny. Look it up. Stamp it out.” Sister Serpents also created a zine, "MadWOMAN Magazine", that was distributed nationally.
The group became immediately infamous for their first poster, which depicted a fetus (in the style of right-wing pro-choice posters) along with text including the phrases: “For all you folks who consider a fetus more valuable than a woman: Have a fetus cook for you; Have a fetus affair; Have a fetus clean your house.” Members explained this artwork directly: “Our poster points to the current fanaticism we call ‘fetus worship’, which preposterously elevates a fertilized egg to the status of ‘unborn child’ and relegates women to the role of parasitical host.”
Their artistic influences included the Berlin-based Dada artists, whose photomontage style and ironic slogans are imitated in the work of Sister Serpents, and the style of the Surrealists. Many of their artworks provided commentary on Western art traditions, such as their re-creation of classical paintings of naked women which replaced the subjects with naked men, or a re-creation of Rodin's "The Thinker" which elongated the subject's head into a long penis.
Several of artworks created by the collective are in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian’s Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum.
The group created a logo of a winged snake, which was turned into a rubber stamp to be stamped in red ink on their posters. This logo was designed to be both a strong and humorous image; the group took their name and this logo from the primordial snake that did not die but that shed its skin to emerge into another life, and that has the ability to open peoples’ eyes to the knowledge of good and evil.
Exhibitions.
Rattle Your Rage: Women's Views of Their Oppressors.
March/April 1990, Chicago; June/July 1990, ABC No Rio, New York City.
This exhibition included art by 32 artists from around the country. Some of the show’s artworks commented less on society and more directly on the art world and its underlying patriarchal assumptions. The opening in Chicago on March 16, 1990 included a screening of R.W. Fassbinder’s film “Bremer Freiheit”, followed by a panel discussion on the refusal of law enforcement to help women who are being assaulted by their partners. Panelists at this event included Lesley Brown, a woman who served time for the contract killing of her abusive husband; film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum; and curator Lynne Warren. The exhibition was described by reviewers as "unabashedly agitational", and criticism of the show from feminists targeted the fact that it focused heavily on issues of abortion and male oppression of women.
First Anniversary Show.
July 1990, The Guild Complex/At the Edge of the Lookingglass, 62 East 13th Street, Chicago
To celebrate their first birthday, members created a collaborative mixed-media installation which featured a huge man-eating snake hanging from the ceiling, a series of banners, and a dartboard encouraging visitors to “take aim at misogyny” while throwing darts at sexist advertisements.
Snakefest '91: Art Against Dickheads.
February 1991, Artemisia Gallery, Chicago
This exhibition at the women-owned Artemisia Gallery was a juried show featuring posters, performance, video, ceramics, sculpture, and painting. The call for art requested submissions by "angry women" that were humorous while also taking a strong political stance against the victimization of women. Works on display included “Sports Nuts (Koons Meets Oldenburg for the Playoffs) by Mary Ellen Croteau, “What Men Fear Most” by Jeramy Turner, “Pennaddition” and “No. 1705366: This man yelled sexual comments to a women” by Margeaux Klein, as well as “Get it Straight: Violence Hurts” by Carol de Press. Another poster in the exhibition read, “Men: stop raping us, stop beating us, stop killing us.”
The exhibition also included a series of "Snake-outs", which were public events including film screenings, talks, and dramatic performances.
Art Against Dickheads: excerpts from Snakefest ’91.
March 1991, Midway Studio, Chicago
Including work from the original Snakefest '91 exhibition, this selection of material showed a strong reaction to the fact that many art galleries and museums show naked women but not naked men; in response, this exhibition from Sister Serpents displayed a lot of penises.
Piss on Patriarchy, Piss on Passivity.
Chicago, 1992.
Public response.
Sister Serpents was accused of "reverse pornography" and came under fire from the American Family Association and the Heritage Foundation. These negative responses were viewed by collective members as proof that their art was necessary.

He currently releases music under the moniker Current Joys. He also is the drummer and lead singer of the indie surf rock band Surf Curse.
As an artist, Rattigan began releasing music as The Nicholas Project from 2011 to 2012, thereafter releasing music as TELE/VISIONS, releasing his debut album, "Wild Heart", on January 2, 2013, as well as all of his music on Bandcamp. After 2015, Rattigan began performing as Current Joys, with his second studio album "Me Oh My Mirror", released on February 16, 2015, reflecting the significant change in his style of music.
He released his third album, "A Different Age", on March 2, 2018. His fourth album, "Voyager", was released on May 14, 2021. 
Personal life.
Rattigan was born in Henderson, Nevada, but moved to Reno for education. Early in his career, he moved to Brooklyn, New York. He now currently resides in Los Angeles, California and Dallas, Texas.
According to Rattigan, he taught himself guitar mostly through online guitar tabs for artists such as System of a Down and Flogging Molly. He also took drum lessons when he was eight years old.
Rattigan has revealed that he suffers from a form of generalized anxiety disorder.
Career.
2011 – 2015: The Nicholas Project, TELE/VISIONS, Franco Years, Devil Worship, and Surf Curse.
Rattigan started individually writing and releasing music as The Nicholas Project, after an anonymous Myspace message inspired him to compose music. He self-released a slew of independently-produced recordings on Bandcamp from November 2011 to October 2012 under the moniker.
As TELE/VISIONS, Rattigan self-released his debut album, "Wild Heart", on January 2, 2013. Citing the name change as being influenced by "Videodrome", Rattigan said to "FORGE Magazine" that "I was writing this song and my roommate had given me a drum machine, so I was like "This is perfect! I can start playing live shows!" and they were like "yeah but no one is going to book you with your name as the Nicholas Project" and they were right.
In 2013, he and classmates Jacob Rubeck, Ciarán Fitzpatrick, Sinéad Kelly &amp; Stephen Cafferky who self-release music under the moniker Gap Girls (Previously Casino Hearts), formed the band Surf Curse. This Surf punk (music genre) band would be their second major project after a small project named Buffalo 66. Through Big Joy Records, an independent label in Los Angeles, California, they released their debut album, "Buds", in June 2013 and the extended play (EP) "Sad Boys EP" in October.
Three EPs were released in 2013: "Young Luv" in January, "No One Will Dance" in February and "Neon Gold" in June. Also, from May to July 2013, Rattigan wrote for Noisey, a brand under "Vice".
An extended play, "2013", was released in January 2014. "2008–2010", a compilation album, was released as the final work under The Nicholas Project in May. A compilation of b-sides and unreleased tracks, "B-Sides, Rarities and Demos", was released a month later.
Rattigan wrote for "Impose" as an intern from September to October 2014.
Found on his YouTube channel, Rattigan has performed under additional names, Franco Years and Devil Worship. Both of these projects can be found on Bandcamp.
2015 – present: Current Joys and Danger Collective.
In February 2015, Rattigan announced that the follow-up to "Wild Heart" was almost complete. The album, "Me Oh My Mirror", was then self-released on February 16.
In January 2016, the limited-edition zine "Alabama (2000 Light Years)" was announced for release in February.
On March 6, 2016, the song "New Flesh" from "Wild Heart" was used in a short video titled "Flesh" on Vine by Internet celebrity Emma Greer, under her online alias GIBBERTON. The video was her last before her death from cancer twenty-one days later and caused a rise in interest towards the song. Two days later, Rattigan released a song, "Kids", and announced the name change to Current Joys instead of TELE/VISIONS, stating that "I no longer feel like it represents the music I want to make and there are too many conflicts with the band Television which present problems for future prospects." To fit with the change, Rattigan re-released all of his music under the moniker on October.
Rattigan, debuting as a music video director, produced and directed the music video for "123" by the folk punk band Girlpool in March 2017.
