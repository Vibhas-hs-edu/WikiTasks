Rydberg polaron

A Rydberg polaron is an exotic state of matter, created at low temperatures, in which a very large atom contains other ordinary atoms in the space between the nucleus and the electrons. For the formation of this atom, scientists had to combine two fields of atomic physics: Bose–Einstein condensates and Rydberg atoms. Rydberg atoms are formed by exciting a single atom into a high-energy state, in which the electron is very far from the nucleus. Bose–Einstein condensates are a state of matter that is produced at temperatures close to absolute zero.
Polarons are induced by using a laser to excite Rydberg atoms contained as impurities in a Bose–Einstein condensate. In those Rydberg atoms, the average distance between the electron and its nucleus can be as large as several hundred nanometres, which is more than a thousand times the radius of a hydrogen atom. Under these circumstances, the distance between the nucleus and the electron of the excited Rydberg atoms is higher than the average distance of the atoms of the condensate. As a result, some atoms lie inside the orbit of the Rydberg atom's electron.
As the atoms don't have an electric charge, they only produce a minimal force on the electron. However, the electron is slightly scattered at the neutral atoms, without even leaving its orbit, and the weak bond that is generated between the Rydberg atom and the atoms inside of it, tying them together, is known as the Rydberg polaron. The new state of matter was predicted by theorists at Harvard University in 2016 and confirmed in 2018 by spectroscopy in an experiment using a strontium Bose–Einstein condensate. Theoretically, up to 170 ordinary strontium atoms could fit closely inside the new orbital of the Rydberg atom, depending on the radius of the Rydberg atom and the density of the Bose–Einstein condensate. The theoretical work for the experiment was performed by theorists at Vienna University of Technology and Harvard University, while the actual experiment and observation took place at Rice University in Houston, Texas.

Off-target genome editing

Off-target genome editing refers to nonspecific and unintended genetic modifications that can arise through the use of engineered nuclease technologies such as: clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN), meganucleases, and zinc finger nucleases (ZFN). These tools use different mechanisms to bind a predetermined sequence of DNA (“target”), which they cleave (or "cut"), creating a double-stranded chromosomal break (DSB) that summons the cell's DNA repair mechanisms (non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR)) and leads to site-specific modifications. If these complexes do not bind at the target, often a result of homologous sequences and/or mismatch tolerance, they will cleave off-target DSB and cause non-specific genetic modifications. Specifically, off-target effects consist of unintended point mutations, deletions, insertions inversions, and translocations.
Designer nuclease systems such as CRISPR-cas9 are becoming increasingly popular research tools as a result of their simplicity, scalability and affordability. With this being said, off-target genetic modifications are frequent and can alter the function of otherwise intact genes. Multiple studies using early CRISPR-cas9 agents found that greater than 50% of RNA-guided endonuclease-induced mutations were not occurring on-target. The Cas9 guide RNA (gRNA) recognizes a 20 bp target DNA sequence, which it binds and cleaves to "edit" the DNA sequence. However, target sequence binding can tolerate mismatches up to several base pairs, meaning there are often thousands of possible binding sites which present several experimental and safety concerns. In the research sphere, off-target effects can confound variables in biological studies leading to potentially misleading and non-reproducible results. In the clinical sphere, the major concerns surround the disruption of vital coding regions leading to genotoxic effects such as cancer. Accordingly, the improvement of the specificity of genome editing tools and the detection of off-target effects are rapidly progressing research areas. Such research incorporates designer nuclease development and discovery, computational prediction programs and databases, and high-throughput sequencing to reduce and anticipate mutational occurrence. Many designer nuclease tools are still in their relative infancy and as their molecular properties and "in vivo" behaviors become better understood they will become increasingly precise and predictable.
Mechanisms.
The CRISPR-Cas9 system works as the adaptive immune system in bacteria and archaea. When a virus infects the bacteria, this system incorporates segments of the viral DNA into the bacterial genome. Upon a second invasion, transcripts from these sequences direct a nuclease activity to its complementary sequence in the invading virus so as to destroy it.
In order to extrapolate this method into eukaryotes in order to develop a gene editing method, a Cas9 protein, a recognition sequence RNA, and a transactivating RNA are required. The fusion of both the recognition sequence specificity CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and transactivating RNA (tracrRNA) is commonly used in experiments and called a single guide RNA (sgRNA). It performs both functions: the first 20 nucleotides of the sgRNA are complementary to the DNA target sequence (cr function), while the nucleotides following are part of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM; tracr function).
Off-targeting nuclease binding originates from a partial but sufficient match to the target sequence. Off-target binding mechanisms can be grouped into two main forms: base mismatch tolerance, and bulge mismatch.
Base mismatch tolerance.
While the Cas9 specificity is believed to be controlled by the 20nt sgRNA and PAM, off-target mutations are still prevalent and could occur with as many as 3-5 base pair mismatches (out of 20) between the sgRNA and the target DNA sequence. Furthermore, sgRNA secondary structures could also affect cleavage of on-target and off-target sites. As mentioned above, sgRNA consists of a sequence (~20nt) which is complementary to the target sequences and this is followed by a PAM sequence which activates the endonuclease activity. While it was shown that 10-12 nt adjacent to PAM (called the “seed sequence”) was enough for Cas9 specificity, Wu "et al." showed that in a catalytically dead Cas9 only 1-5 base pairs of seed sequence is required for specificity. This was later proven by other studies as well. The Cas9 protein binding is further affected by a number of mechanisms:
It is important to note that DNA methylation of CpG sites reduces efficiency of binding of Cas9 and other factors in cells. Therefore, there is an epigenetic link which will be explored more for the future of epigenome editing. Variations within the PAM sequence can also affect sgRNA activity, in turn affecting the sgRNA itself. In commonly used Cas9 systems, the PAM motif is 5’ NGG 3’, where N represents any of the four DNA nucleotides. The requirement of the PAM sequence can cause specificity problems as some regions will have an available target sequence to make a desired genetic modification. A report stated that 99.96% of sites previously assumed to be unique Cas9 targets in human exons may have potential off target effects containing NAG or NGG PAM and a single base mismatch in the seed sequence.
Bulge mismatch.
Both off target sites with missing bases (or deletions) and off target sites with extra bases (or insertions) called RNA bulge and DNA bulge respectively, have effects in Cas9 specificity and cleavage activity. Lin "et al." mimicked these bulges by adding and deleting bases from the sgRNA sequence such that a base deletion in the sgRNA would yield an RNA bulge and a base insertion would yield a DNA bulge. By studying the mutation rates via NHEJ, they came to the following results:
Improvements.
Methods to increase specificity.
The widely used "Streptococcus pyogenes" Cas9 (SpCas9) nuclease is effective, however it induces unwanted off-target mutations at high frequencies. Several engineering and screening methods have been described in an effort to reduce genome-wide off-target mutations including nuclease mutation, protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence modification, guide RNA (gRNA) truncation and novel nuclease discovery. For example, in 2013, Fu "et al." reported that by truncating the gRNA from &lt;20 bp in length to 17 or 18 bp the target specificity of the nuclease increased up to 5,000 fold and mismatch occurrences above 3 bases rarely, if ever occurred.
Cas9 nickases.
The spCas9 nuclease can also be mutated in a variety of ways to improve specificity and control. Nuclease domains can be mutated independently of each other into what are known as Cas9 nickases. These nucleases have one active and inactive nuclease domain which result in a complex that performs single strand cleavage. Cas9 nickases can be employed in tandem (known as paired nickases), which perform two single strand 'cuts' on alternate strands. Using this strategy both Cas9 nickases must co-localize, bind and cleave their target, which drastically reduces the probability of off-target indels. Also, the DSBs cleaved by paired nickases have long overhangs instead of blunt ends which provide improved control of targeted insertions.
Fok1-dCas9 and dimerization nucleases.
As monomeric nucleases often involve high levels of off-target effects, dimerization is an attractive strategy. In a dimer system, both nucleases must bind to their individual targets or ‘half-sites’ and then interact and dimerize to initiate cleavage which greatly decreases the probability of off-target effects. A method that incorporates the reliability of dimerization-dependent FokI nuclease domains, used in ZFNs and TALENs, with the simplicity of CRISPR-cas9 has been developed. The FokI nuclease was originally found in "Flavobacterium okeanokoites", and will only cleave DNA given dimerization activation. Basically, the researchers fused this nuclease to a CRISPR complex with an inactive Cas9 nuclease (Fok1-dCas9). The gRNA directs the CRISPR complex to the target site but the 'cut' is made by dimerized Fok1. It is estimated that the Fok1-dCas9 strategy reduces detectable off-target effects by 10,000 fold, which makes it effective for applications requiring highly precise and specific genome editing.
Nuclease mutation.
In addition to a gRNA target, Cas9 requires binding to a specific 2-6 nucleotide sequence PAM. In commonly used SpCas9 systems the PAM motif is 5’ NGG 3’, where N represents any of the four DNA nucleotides. The requirement of the PAM sequence can cause specificity limitations as some regions will not have an available target sequence to make a desired genetic modification. The PAM sequence can be edited to non-canonical NAG and NGA motifs which not only improve the specificity but also reduced off-target effects. A D1135E mutant appears to alter PAM specificities. The D1135E mutant reduces off-target effects and increases the specificity of SpCas9. An additional variant, SpCas9-HF1, also results in favorable improvements to Cas9 specificity. Several combinations of substitutions known to form non-specific DNA contacts (N497A, R661A, Q695A, and Q926A) have been identified. A quadruple substitution of these residues (later named SpCas9-HF1), has extremely low levels of off-target effects as detected by GUIDE-seq experiments. Variants such as SpCas9-HF1 and D1135E, and others like it can be combined, tested and readily added to existing SpCas9 vectors to reduce the rates of off-target mutations. Additionally, many of the engineering strategies listed above can be combined to create increasingly robust and reliable RNA-guided nuclease editing tools. Directed evolution can also be used to reduce nuclease activity on particular target sequences, leading to variants such as SpartaCas (containing mutations D23A, T67L, Y128V, and D1251G relative to wildtype SpCas9).
CRISPRi and CRISPRa.
CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) have also been developed. These systems can precisely alter gene transcription at the DNA level without inflicting irreversible genetic alterations. Furthermore, by directly acting on DNA they are generally more specific and predictable compared to RNAi. Although CRISPRi/a cannot replace genome editing in all experiments, they can act as effective alternatives in some cases. CRISPRi and CRISPRa use a deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) enzyme that cannot cut DNA, but can deliver transcriptional activators and repressors to modulate desired gene expression with high precision. Currently, off-target effects of CRISPRi are minimal, and show a reduced response and sensitivity to single-base mismatches. Importantly, when non-specific effects do inevitably occur they are reversible, time-dependent, and less damaging than DNA editing, making them effective alternatives that can limit the off-target burden when possible. CRISPR-cas13b, using a type IV CRISPR-Cas system (as opposed to the commonly used type II) can target and edit specific RNA sequences. Such an RNA editing platform has the ability to specifically edit mRNA, and therefore protein translation, without altering the DNA. The represents a promising technology that if successful would reduce the burden of irreversible off-target mutations.
Detection.
Even though one might take careful measures to avoid off-target mutations, and even if one succeeds, a confirmatory screen needs to be done in order to screen for unintended mutations. Currently there are plenty of biased and unbiased methods for such a screen and only two "in vitro" methods. All of these are listed below:
Targeted, exome, and whole genome sequencing.
In case of normal targeted sequencing, the biased approach will yield results only for the intended area of capture, which hinders the search as no unexpected mutations will come up on the screen. While it is easy and cheap, it becomes time consuming and expensive once more target sites are added. Exome sequencing utilizes exome capture to acquire the protein coding regions of the genome. It is unbiased, however, it will not yield off target mutations in the non-coding region of the genome. In case of whole genome sequencing, the entire genome is screened for off target mutations. Currently, this method is expensive and like exome sequencing, whole genome also requires a reference genome to make inferences.
BLESS.
BLESS is the easiest way to detect and quantify off-target mutations by screening for DSBs in the genome. This method relies on direct "in situ" breaks labeling enrichment on streptavidin. Developed in 2013, BLESS is performed by ligating the DSB ends with biotin i.e. biotinylation. This is followed by separation/collection of said ligated ends using streptavidin. A linked sequence is added to the biotinylated sequences and this final mix is then sequenced to yield the position of the off target mutation. Being unbiased in nature, BLESS gives information about site of mutation within the genome rather than the proteins involved or associated with the DSBs. However, BLESS can only detect mutations at the time of experiment and not the ones which were formed earlier and were repaired.
LAM-HTGTS.
Linear Amplification Mediated - High Throughput Genome Wide Translocation Sequencing, or LAM-HTGTS, is a method developed to track translocation events caused by joining between DSBs. Developed to detect off-target mutations from TALEN and CRISPR-Cas9, this technique is based on DNA repair by end joining in DSBs. Once the nuclease is added, it goes on to produce on- and off-target mutations. Along with this there is a bait sequence which also gets cleaved. Therefore, if another DSB occurs on a chromosome other than the bait sequence chromosome, both of them are joined leading to a translocation. Since the bait sequence is known, this translocated sequence is amplified with primers. In case there is no translocation, there is a restriction site within which gets cleaved in order to prevent amplification of only the bait sequence. The amplified DNA is then sequenced to study large genomic rearrangements due to off-target mutations. One drawback is that it relies on simultaneous presence of bait and another DSB.
GUIDE-Seq.
Another approach to find off-target mutations due to nuclease activity is the GUIDE-Seq method. GUIDE-seq or Genome Wide Unbiased Identification of DSBs Enabled by Sequencing is based on the incorporation of double stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (dsODN) into DSBs via NHEJ. Its amplification is followed by sequencing. Since two primers will be used to sequence the dsODNs, the regions flanking the DSB along with the DSB will be amplified. Thus allowing mapping the off target mutation. This technique has been applied to identify all previously known off-target sites as well as new ones with frequencies as low as 0.03%. Just like BLESS, however, GUIDE-seq can only detect DSBs present at the time of study.
Digenome-Seq.
One of the current "in vitro" methods, Digenome-Seq utilizes Cas9's property of cleaving the genome to get an unbiased profile of the entire genome. In this method, Cas9 is added to gDNA and the after effects are studied using high-throughput sequencing. Since the fragments are formed due to the same nuclease, the ends of these fragments can be mapped aligned. Two big advantages are that it can be used to study up to 10 gRNAs at once and can identify targets to frequencies as low as 0.01%. The main advantage, however, is that this method is "in vitro" i.e. the DSBs introduced by Cas9 will not be processed by the DNA repair machinery (unlike BLESS and GUIDE-seq) and thus will include all possible off target mutants. However, it might lead to large number of false positives as well.
CIRCLE-Seq.
The latest addition to the "in vitro" methods in detecting off target mutations is CIRCLE-seq. Licensed by Beacon genomics (along with GUIDE-seq), CIRCLE-seq aims to remove the drawbacks of Digenome-seq such as the need for a large sample size and read depth (~400 million reads) and the high background that makes identification of low frequency cleavage events harder. It adopts a restriction enzyme independent strategy to create and select conversion of randomly sheared DNA. On cleavage, the target DNA forms a stem loop to which adaptors can be added for sequencing. While this proved possible, the other possibility yielded a fold high difference in detection/. In the second case, the sequence is cleaved using Cas9 and when it is cleaved again at the half site, a circular cut is available (which is the reason for the name CIRCLE-seq). Nearly all sites identified by circularization contain both linear detected sites and newer ones suggesting that CIRCLE-seq does not bias between breaks and obtains strong low frequency breaks as well. It further helps to sequence the break site from both sides of cleavage as compared to other methods which have only one read side.
Barcoded libraries of targets.
Nucleases such as Cas9 may also be challenged "in vitro" by randomized libraries of targets. Adapter ligation to quantify cleaved and uncleaved library members allows for unbiased measurement of a nuclease's specificity profile. Measurement of cleavage of barcoded libraries of targets (BLT) with SpCas9 indicated that specificity profiles were guide-specific and depend on the guide sequence as well as the nuclease itself. Unbiased specificity profiles based on each particular Cas9-gRNA complex may then be used to build guide-specific predictive models for "in vitro" cleavage.
Significance.
Gene therapy.
In order for gene editing technologies to make the leap towards safe and widespread use in the clinic, the rate of off-target modification needs to be rendered obsolete. The safety of gene therapy treatment is of utmost concern, especially during clinical trials when off-target modifications can block the further development of a candidate product. Perhaps the most well-known example of modern gene therapy is CAR-T therapy, which is used for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma. To limit the rate of off-target cleavage, the therapy uses a highly specific and finely tuned TALEN, which has proven to have little-to-no background off-target interaction. CAR-T immunotherapy is an "ex vivo" procedure, which means that the patient's immune cells (in this case T-cells) are extracted and edited using designer nucleases. While TALEN system development is expensive and time consuming, research and engineering modifications have drastically limited their rate of off-target interaction. However, patients receiving the treatment are still monitored frequently and will be for the next 15 years so that off-target effects and immunogenic responses can be analyzed and brought into consideration as new gene therapies are brought to clinical trial.
CCR5 ZFN-modified autologous helper T cell trials.
A phase I/II clinical trial enrolled 12 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) to test the safety and effectiveness of administering ZFN-modified autologous helper T cells. Through targeted deletions, the custom ZFN disables the C-C chemokine receptor 5 ("CCR5") gene, which encodes a co-receptor that is used by the HIV virus to enter the cell. As a result of the high degree of sequence homology between C-C chemokine receptors this ZFN also cleaves "CCR2", leading to off-target ∼15kb deletions and genomic rearrangements. The impacts of these "CCR2" modifications are still not known, and to date there have been no reported side effects. However, "CCR2" is known to have many critical roles in neural, and metabolic systems.
Gene Drives.
Engineered gene drives using CRISPR-cas9 are currently being tested and have been proposed as strategies to eliminate invasive species and disease vectors. By genetically modifying an organism to express an endogenous sequence-specific endonuclease, a target (such as a fertility gene) can be cleaved on the opposite chromosome. A DSB at the target leads to homologous repair which effectively renders the organism homozygous for the desired target sequence. This strategy, known as a homing drive, can suppress a population by affecting a critical gene or inducing recessive sterility. However, if such a system were released into the wild, the CRISPR-cas9 system would remain function indefinitely. With every subsequent generation, off-target mutations would become increasingly likely and the effects of these mutations on a species would be stochastic. Off-target mutations could disable the suppressive qualities of a gene drive while maintaining the endonuclease expression. In such a situation there would be an increased risk of gene flow between the target species and other species likely leading to undesired outcomes.
Controversy.
The increased use of genome editing and its eventual translation towards clinical use has evoked controversy surrounding the true off-target burden of the technologies.
Schaefer "et al." 2017.
On May 30, 2017 a two-page correspondence article was published in Nature Methods that reported an unusually high number of off-target SNVs and indels after sequencing mice that were previously involved in an "in vivo" gene repair experiment. The previous experiment, completed by the same group, successfully restored the vision of blind mouse strain ("rd1") by correcting the Y347X mutation in the "Pde6b" gene using a CRISPR-cas9 system. After completing the experiment two genetically corrected mice were whole genome sequenced and compared to control and known mouse strain genomes. Greater than 1,600 SNVs, and 128 indels were discovered, of which 1,397 SNVs and 117 indels were shared between the two edited mice, suggesting that the off-target effects were not random. Algorithms attempting to predict the location of these off-target mutations failed for an overwhelming majority of loci. In comparison, a 2016 whole exome sequencing study found 19 SNVs and 3 indels in 5 edited mice, while Schaefer "et al." found 115 exonic SNVs and 9 indels in just 2 edited mice. Many experts disagreed with the paper and criticized it through journal articles and social media, suggesting that unusual CRISPR treatments were used in the initial paper and the sample size was too low for significance (n=2). Nature Methods has issued two editorial notes on the paper. Nonetheless, off-target rates are consistently found to be more frequent "in vivo" compared to cell culture experiments, and are thought to be particularly common in humans.

Dine Doneff (born 1965), also known as Kostas Theodorou, is a Macedonian composer and multi-instrumentalist.
Biography.
Born in West Germany to Macedonian parents and raised in the northern Greek prefecture of Edessa, Dine Doneff (or Kostas Theodorou, according to his Greek citizenship name) has been active as a musician and composer since the mid-eighties.
Faced with the choice between school and music, he left his home village and fled to Thessaloniki. He became a self taught musician.
By the 90s he was working as an arranger, ensemble director and producer on studio recordings. Alternating between touring abroad, he joined the group Savina Yannatou &amp; Primavera en Salonico in 2001, with four albums released by ECM; from 2002 to 2005 he taught at the Technical Education Institute of Epirus and the University of Macedonia. Later, under the fictional auspices of ‘no bizz productions’, he became the pivot, and inspiration, of “ninety nine (99)”, improvised public rehearsal performances in a small underground theatre in Thessaloniki from 2005 to 2011 involving onstage encounters between Doneff and musicians, dancers, actors, poets and visual artists. Interludes of composing for the theatre and silver screen were interspersed with forays into theatre direction and, under the name of Tome Rapovina, directing and editing short films. From 2014 to 2016, he worked as a composer and actor with the Kammerpiele in Munich and the Thalia Theater in Hamburg.
As a result of his appearance as an ECM artist, Dine Doneff together with painter &amp; photographer Fotini Potamia, founded the label “neRED music” following a suggestion of Manfred Eicher, ECM’s founder and producer. The label’s first releases “Rousilvo” 2018 and "IN/OUT" 2019, are marketed in cooperation with ECM Records.

Swedish Army Quartermaster Corps

Swedish Army Quartermaster Corps () was an administrative corps for personnel within the Swedish Army created in 1880. From the corps, the Swedish Army was provided with staff for various commissary positions. The head of the corps was the Quartermaster-General of the Swedish Army. In 1966, the corps was amalgamated with the Swedish Naval Supply Service ("Marinintendenturkåren") and the Swedish Air Force's quartermaster officers and formed the Quartermaster Corps of the Swedish Armed Forces. It was in turn amalgamated with the Swedish Army Ordnance Corps in 1973 and formed the Commissary Corps of the Swedish Armed Forces which was disbanded in 1990.
History.
Swedish Army Quartermaster Corps ("Arméns intendenturkår") was formed by Royal Decree on 9 April 1880. The creation of the corps was part of the ongoing reform of the Swedish Army's administrative organization. The idea was that through a unified management lay the foundations of good recruitment and better training of administrative personnel. Head of the corps was the Quartermaster-General of the Swedish Army, who also headed the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration's Quartermaster Department which from 1943 was called the Army Administration's Commissariat Department ("Arméförvaltningens intendenturavdelning") and from 1954 was called the Royal Swedish Army Supply Administration. In his capacity as chief of the corps, the Quartermaster-General had, at his side, an office or staff, which over time was reorganized and changed its name on several occasions:
At the time of the formation, the corps comprised all the personnel who handled administrative duties that belonged to the supplies in army units and stores. During the 1890s, the quartermaster staff at the General Staff and the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration's Quartermasters Department ("Arméförvaltningens intendentsdepartement") were also included. Initially, the corps was regarded as civil-military, but was awarded military corps status in 1915. In order to gain entry as a member of the corps, one later required completed training in commissariat service. Quartermaster aspirants were trained from 1909 at the corps' military management course; from 1943 at the Swedish Army Quartermaster School ("Intendenturförvaltningsskolan").
From the corps, the army was provided with staff for the various commissary positions (regimental quartermasters and commissioners, "förvaltare" and others). The 1907 administrative reform distinguished certain parts of the administration from the area of responsibility of the corps (arms, buildings, healthcare, etc.). Remaining was the responsibility for camp, rations, clothing, horses, certain vehicles, fuels and accounting matters. The Defence Act of 1936 meant in this regard that the motor vehicles were completely removed from the corps.
After World War II, the organization of the military administration and its staff corps' were investigated. The result was partly a coordination of the Swedish Army Supply Administration ("Arméintendenturörvaltningen") with the Royal Swedish Naval Materiel Administration's Commissariat Department ("Marinförvaltningen intendenturavdelning") and the Royal Swedish Air Force Materiel Administration Commissariat Bureau ("Flygförvaltningens intendenturbyrå") to the newly established Quartermaster Administration of the Swedish Armed Forces in 1963; and to a corresponding coordination of the Swedish Army Quartermaster Corps ("Intendenturkåren") with the Swedish Naval Supply Service ("Marinintendenturkåren") (formed in 1904) and the Swedish Air Force's quartermaster officers (which had not previously constituted a special staff corps) to a joint corps, the Quartermaster Corps of the Swedish Armed Forces which was established in 1966.

Bieberite

Bieberite (CoSO4 · 7H2O) is a pinkish red colored sulfate mineral high in cobalt content. The name is derived from the type locality at the copper deposit in Bieber, Hesse, Germany. It has been described and reported as far back as the 1700s. Bieberite primarily occurs as a secondary mineral, forming in cobalt-bearing arsenide and sulfide deposits through oxidation.
Natural bieberite crystals may have a small amount of cobalt lattice sites instead occupied by magnesium and copper (Palache et al., 1960).
Geologic occurrence.
Aside from the type locality at Hesse, Germany bieberite has been found in multiple countries in Europe, North and South America, and Africa, as well as in Japan. In Greece bieberite was identified for the first time in the 2000s at the Lavrion Pb-Ag-Zn deposit, a polymetallic sulfide deposit that underwent supergene oxidation during its formation. In England in the United Kingdom, bieberite has been found at mines Penberthy Croft Mine and Wheal Alfred in St Hilary, Cornwall and Phillack, Cornwall respectively.
Bieberite was identified in volcanic cave settings for the first time at Irazú Volcano, Costa Rica and reported in 2018. The mineral roemerite was identified at Island Mountain, Trinity County, California in the United States of America for the first time in association with bieberite along with pyrrhotite, claudeite, goslarite, fibroferrite, and morenosite and a description of the mineral from the site published in 1927. The occurrence of bieberite at the Island Mountain deposit had earlier been recorded in 1923. Uranium mineralization in the Cameron Area of Coconino County, Arizona was found to have beiberite as one of the cobalt mineral species in association with secondary uranium minerals formed through oxidation.

Plot.
The story starts in India in 1977–78 and the story goes back and forth between 1977–78 and 2016. The story starts with Bhola in 1977 in the village of Bassi Pathana in Punjab, India. Bhola is an innocent young man who is helpful and kind to all. He usually helps the villagers. The story comes to present time in 2016 where in Bassi Pathana there is a market where two shop owners Chaman Laal Sachdeva and Satpal Aneja are portrayed. The two are rivals and want to be the market heads. Neeta, son of Chaman Laal works with him in their ladies suit shop and Mishri and her father Satpal runs a sweet shop. Both are shown hating each other because of the family rivalry but soon comes closer. They elope because of their fathers; denial for their marriage with the funds collected for Jaagran on 8 November 2016 and go to a hotel to stay for night. 
But things turn upside down when the ₹500 and ₹1000 notes are demonetised by the Govt. They return to their homes and start living life normally. Neeta sees their friend Kiran's marriage being pulled back due to the dowry amount not being given and with help of Mishri and her friends tries to arrange the dowry.
Here we see a flashback where Bhola was at Shindi's house and Shindi's brother disliked his presence there and takes him to the panchayat where he is asked by the panchayat to marry Shindi if he can build a house for themselves at a land allotted by panchayat which will take ₹1000 to construct.
He accepts this and wants to earn money, He went back with money but the demonetization in 1978 under Janta Party Government led to the earnings going in vain. The villagers helped him and the story is set back to 2016 where at the wedding of Kiran the Neeta and Mishri succeed in convincing Kiran's father-in-law to let the wedding happen.

Ethel Stein

Ethel Stein (1917–2018) was an American textile artist who lived in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y. While her work was primarily in weaving, her best known piece is the puppet Lamb Chop.
Early life and education.
Stein was born as Ethel Levy on June 22, 1917, to Tanya Levy in New York City. She was raised by her aunt and Uncle, Ella and Abbo Ostrowsky, in Croton-on-Hudson. Stein attended Hessian Hills school and was taught woodworking by sculptor Wharton and painting by painter/muralist/lithographer George Biddle In the latter half of the 1930s, she worked as an assistant at the Educational Alliance Art School where her uncle, Mr. Ostrowsky, was the director. While working there, Stein learned from sculptor Chaim Gross studying with Louise Nevelson. In the late 1930s Stein moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts where she studied with Josef Albers (husband of the weaver Anni Albers) and others who were associated with the Bauhaus movement. It was here that she met her husband, the architect Richard G. Stein, while he was doing his master's at Harvard. He served in World War II, after which the couple settled in Croton-on-Hudson.
Career.
Stein started out as a sculptor. In the 1960s she exhibited as a member of the Vectors artist group in New York City. After meeting Milton Sonday, the curator of textiles at Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, she became increasingly interested in textiles and studied the museum's collection of textiles. Stein studied historical textile techniques using a microscope to see how the textile was formed and sketching the treads. She used these techniques, along with her knowledge of loom technology, to experiment to create new and different works. Her woven works included geometric abstract works and figurative images, using bright colours, muted colours and monochromatic black/grey/white.
In Ikat, Stein created a technique that combined satin binding pattern with double ikat, such that the resist dyed warp and weft threads created a variation of colour intensity, and the weft-based pattern created a higher contrast than traditional ikat weavings.
As a weaver, Stein's professional circle included textile artists such as Lenore Tawney and Mary Walker Phillips.
Even into her 90s, Stein wove everyday in her studio.
Puppets.
Ethel Stein created puppets out of old socks, initially for her son's nursery school, before starting a business of it. She sold the puppets through a Manhattan department store. In 1953, one puppet went to television puppeteer, Shari Lewis, and became known as Lamb Chop. Stein created several puppets for Shari Lewis.
Death and legacy.
Ethel Stein died of complications from pneumonia on Friday, March 9, 2018 in Cortlandt, New York at the age of 100. Jack Lenor Larsen, a textile designer and author said of Stein, "Ethel Stein did not shun an audience; rather, she sidestepped the pervasive marketing focus of others." Daniel Walker, of the Art Institute of Chicago, called her a "weaver's weaver".
Work.
Major exhibitions.
Ethel Stein exhibited in group shows at major institutions in the United States including Cooper Hewitt, the American Craft Museum in New York, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as exhibiting in England, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
In 2014, Ethel Stein had her first solo exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago at the age of 96.

Cecil Madden

Cecil Charles Madden, MBE (29 November 1902 – 27 May 1987), was an English pioneer of television production. In 1936, he moved from BBC radio to its experimental television service, and was responsible for many programmes until the service was suspended during the Second World War. After the service resumed in 1946, he resumed his television work, and later became a BBC executive, until his retirement in 1964.
Life and career.
Madden was born in Mogador, Morocco, the eldest of three children, all boys, of a British consular official, Archibald Maclean Madden CMG, and his wife, Cecilia Catherine, daughter of Allen Page "née" Moor. After being educated at French schools in Morocco, schools in Spain, and, in England, at Dover College, he worked for the Rio Tinto Group in Spain. On business trips and during his holidays he attended Broadway productions and worked in theatres in Paris.
In June 1932, Madden married Muriel Emily, née Cochrane. There were a son and a daughter of the marriage. In 1933 he joined the BBC, and was assigned to its talks department, for which he produced a series entitled "Anywhere for a News Story". He then produced the outside broadcasting spot on a popular Saturday evening programme, "In Town Tonight", before moving to the new Empire Service, the forerunner of the BBC World Service, as a senior producer.
In 1936, the BBC set up a television service, in which Madden joined Gerald Cock, its recently appointed head. After an experimental broadcast in August, the regular service began on 2 November. On that day's schedule, Dallas Bower produced an afternoon variety programme starring Adele Dixon and Buck and Bubbles, and Madden devised and produced the first in a long series titled "Picture Page, A Magazine of Topical and General Interest". "Radio Times" commented the following year, "A characteristic of Cecil Madden's "Picture Page" that has made it a distinctive part of television programmes has been its unfailing topicality". Madden secured a wide range of guests, ranging from the Sultan of Zanzibar to the conductors Wilhelm Furtwängler and Fritz Reiner, the contract bridge expert Ely Culbertson, the educator Maria Montessori, the theatre director Sir Barry Jackson, politicians, sportsmen and women and others. Until television shut down in September 1939 for the duration of the Second World War, Madden organised and produced live programmes of variety, ballets, and drama. He sometimes appeared in front of the cameras as presenter.
On the outbreak of war, Madden returned to radio. In 1940 he was appointed head of the BBC's overseas entertainment unit, broadcasting to Commonwealth forces serving abroad. He presented the "American Eagle in Britain" programme from 17 November 1940 to 9 September 1945; "The Times" commented that it earned Madden the title of the "GI's friend". He also produced the popular "Variety Bandbox". Madden's artists included Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, Marlene Dietrich, Gertrude Lawrence, and George Raft; Glenn Miller conducted the band. Among younger artists discovered by Madden were Petula Clark and the Beverley Sisters.
When television reopened on 7 June 1946, Madden returned to his former post. He scheduled new programmes including "This Is Your Life" and "What's My Line". In 1950-51 he was in charge of children's programmes, and is credited by "The Times" with transforming children's television from "a whimsy affair" into "an intelligent and entertaining show". He then became assistant to the controller of television programmes and worked mostly in management rather than producing, until his retirement from the BBC in 1964.
Madden, a resident of Chelsea, died in Westminster Hospital, London on 27 May 1987.

2018 anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka

The Sri Lankan anti-Muslim riots were a series of religious riots targeting Muslims that began in the Sri Lankan town of Ampara on 26 February 2018, spreading to Kandy District by 2 March until its end on 10 March 2018. Muslim citizens, mosques and other properties were attacked by mobs of Sinhalese Buddhists,The Government of Sri Lanka undertook a forceful crackdown on the rioting by imposing a state of emergency and deploying the Sri Lankan Armed Forces to assist the Police in the affected areas. The situation was brought under control by 9 March. Two fatalities and ten injuries were reported among Sinhalese, Muslims and Police. According to the police, forty five incidents of damage to houses and businesses have been reported, while four places of worship have been attacked. The police arrested 81 persons in connection with rioting.
Rioting in Kandy District began in Udispattuwa and Teldeniya, later spreading to Digana, Tennekumbura and other areas. It was sparked when a middle-aged truck driver of Sinhalese ethnicity was assaulted by four Muslim youth following a traffic accident. The truck driver died of his injuries four days later. On 5 March Sinhalese mobs began attacking Muslim properties in the region, resulting in widespread damage to property while some groups of local Sinhalese youth organized by Buddhist monks protected mosques from attackers; cricketers Mahela Jayawardena, Kumar Sangakkara, and Sanath Jayasuriya condemned the attacks and nearly 300 mostly Sinhalese volunteers rebuilt a Muslim business in Anamaduwa. The riots, the first large-scale Buddhist-Muslim sectarian violence since similar riots in 2014, prompted the Government of Sri Lanka to declare a State of Emergency for a period of ten days, in addition to the police curfew already imposed on the district. The state of emergency is the first such since 2011.
Social media networks including WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram were blocked in parts of the country in an effort to prevent mobs from organizing their attacks and spreading propaganda. However, the block on the social media networks were uplifted after 72 hours and the cabinet minister, Harsha de Silva further stated that the social media networks have been returned to normal conditions by 10 March 2018. After three days of raid in the main town of Kandy, at least 81 people were reported to have been arrested including the main suspect, Amith Jeevan Weerasinghe by the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) of the Sri Lankan police in connection to the incident as the situation has been under controlled by the forces. However, a curfew has been reimposed in the Kandy town until 9 March 2018. The police officers state that the unusual situation which prevailed in the country for few days has been brought under control but tight securities have been imposed in few parts of the nation as the predicted threats have been focused on the Muslim prayers on 9 March 2018 which is a Friday. The riots were denounced by Buddhist monks and many Sinhalese and Buddhist monks rallied to protect and help Muslims and Mosques during the prayers across the country. According to the Government, Independent observers, Muslims and Sinhalese in the area the majority of the rioters came from other areas of Sri Lanka to carry out the riots.
The government revealed that about nearly 465 houses, businesses and vehicles were destroyed and promised to compensate for the families who were severely affected due to the communal violence.
A few weeks after the end of the anti-Muslim riots, new CCTV footage revealed that some police officials aided the rioters. Further politicians of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's SLPP were seen during the riots and claimed to be trying to calm the rioters while the Government accused them of helping rioters. They were arrested on charges of torching a mosque but were granted bail after it was found that the alleged mosque was not torched. It was confirmed that the deficiencies and ineffective attitudes of the police are to be investigated and questioned by the Sri Lankan government.
Background.
Despite mostly coexisting peacefully, many Sinhalese are suspicious of Muslims, believing that their slightly higher birth rates threaten their demographic supremacy, while others view Muslim businessmen as exploiting poor Sinhalese. Some political analysts believe that Sinhalese extremists are trying to transfer remaining hostility against Tamils onto the mostly Tamil-speaking Muslim population. Another factor is increasing Arab influence over Sri Lankan Muslim culture in recent years including the building a number of mosques using money coming from Arab countries and the adoption of the niqab by Muslim women which diverges from traditional dress in the area.
Sri Lanka has seen several communally charged incidents between the majority Sinhala community and the country's Muslim minority. Ampara District had experienced tensions since 2017, with Buddhist groups accusing Muslims of forced conversions and vandalising Buddhist archaeological sites.
The recent communal violence in Kandy is the first since the Black July violence which occurred in 1983 between Tamils and Sinhalese Buddhists. This violence is also the first time such communal violence has occurred between Muslims and Buddhists in the district of Kandy since the 1915 Ceylonese riots which was incited by the British administration.
Ampara.
Late at night on 26 February, a group of youths arrived at a restaurant on D.S. Senanayake Street in Ampara town. The meal served by the restaurant contained elements resembling tablets. The youth shared a video of the owner, a Muslim man, supposedly admitting that the food contained sterilization pills. The owner of the restaurant was physically attacked by a mob, who then spread the word about the incident. The police arrested the restaurant owner as a result of the video. The claim made by the video was later proven to be false; the owner had in fact nodded his head in fear of the angry mob, without actually knowing the Sinhala word (sterilization pills), and thus without understanding the question he had been asked. according to sources Sinhalese mobs are not arrested.
Kandy District.
At 2 PM on 22 February 2018, a Sinhalese lorry driver from Ambala, Medamahanuwara was assaulted by four Muslim youths in Karaliyadda, Teldeniya. The victim was admitted to the intensive care unit of the Kandy General Hospital and died on the night of 2 March from his injuries. The victim's assistant (also traveling in the lorry) was assaulted, admitted to hospital, and later discharged after treatment.
The motive behind the attack has not been clearly established. Some reports state it stemmed from a road accident where the trucker had damaged the wing mirror of an auto rickshaw the assailants had been travelling in while attempting to overtake it; all four suspects were reported to have been intoxicated. The suspects were arrested by the Sri Lanka Police on the day of the attack and remanded until 7 March.
Riots and violence.
Ampara.
An aggressive mob had launched attacks on several shops in the surrounding area of Ampara. Hotels in the vicinity of the mosque were also attacked by the mobs, with the police unable to bring the situation under control. The Special Task Force and police reinforcements were then dispatched from nearby police stations which led to the mob dispersing.
Areas with larger Muslim populations in Maruthamunai, Sammanthurai, Akkaraipattu, Addalaichenai and Kalmunai in Ampara District were conducting Hartals, as response against the anti-Muslim riots. The protests resulted in 8 buses being damaged, while Tamil media reporters were protected by the police. 31 Muslims were arrested who were damaging public properties and released after warning.
Kandy District.
The first signs of violence were reported from Udispattuwa on the night of 2 March as the body of the victim was being taken to Ambala. Groups set light to tires on the road as a sign of protest against the killing; the police, anticipating violence, deployed 1000 Special Task Force personnel in and around the area, encompassing Moragahamula, Udispattuwa, Teldeniya and Ambagahalanda. Despite these efforts, two Muslim-owned shops in Moragahamula were subjected to arson on the night of 4 March- 28 suspects were arrested for their involvement. General disorderly behaviour and assorted violence associated to the killing by the residents of Teldeniya and outlying areas were also reported. The unrest spread to Digana on the morning of 5 March, when a large mob converged on the town, setting fire to a mosque, shops and houses. In response, police used tear gas and water cannons in an attempt to disperse the crowd, which saw retaliation from the mob through various projectiles while the violence spread to more residences, shops and nearby vehicles. Traffic along the A26 was forced to a halt, and by 3 PM, the police requested the support of the Sri Lanka Army, which deployed 200 troops from the Sinha Regiment base in Digana in the evening. The police then followed up by declaring a state of curfew district-wide in Kandy until 6 AM on 6 March; the same curfew was reimposed on Teldeniya and Pallekele at 8 PM on 6 March, after the body of a 24-year-old Muslim male was discovered within the remains of a shop in Digana. By the evening of 6 March, a total of 4 mosques, 37 houses, 46 shops and 35 vehicles were damaged or destroyed as a result of the riots in both Digana and other locations in the Kandy District; 1 confirmed fatality was reported.
On the night of 6 March, mobs were observed in Lewella and Balagolla, moving towards Tennekumbura and the general direction of Kandy- an arson attack on a mosque in Tennekumbura was reported. High ambulance activity was reported from Menikhinna, and 7 people were arrested there for disorderly behaviour and for causing unrest. The curfew put in place on the evening of 6 March was lifted briefly on the morning of the 7th, but soon reimposed. 7 March also saw Muslim residents of Mullegama barricading themselves inside a local mosque after a Sinhalese mob attacked their homes alleging theft of a donation box from a nearby Buddhist temple; the Muslims accused the police of inaction in the face of the mobs. One Sinhalese male was reported to have died and another injured in an explosion of unknown origin in the course of the Mullegama attacks. Some media reported his injuries sustained in an attack carried out by Muslim men. A reaction that a Buddhist monk at the Mullegama temple said was precipitated by a projectile attack against his temple by Muslims earlier in the day. Katugastota also saw anti-Muslim violence and arson, while a mob assembled in the Ambatanna town center after a rumor of a temple being attacked: the mob then proceeded to damage property and engage in rioting.
Other districts.
Small incidents were reported in other districts against Muslims. Unknown group burnt a tire in front mosque in Medina Nagar, Vavuniya. However, police and army controlled the situation and gave security to the mosque. Some shops belongs to Muslims were damaged and assaulted on workers on those shops in Ambatenna, Matale. A grenade blast has also occurred in the ongoing communal violence in the nation as a hand grenade has been made to blast by a group of people leaving one dead. The following incident has been reported following few hours after the ban on social media networks.
Response.
Sri Lankan police arrested at least 81 rioters including Amith Jeevan Weerasinghe, the leader of the Sinhalese Buddhist Nationalist Mahason Balakaya who is believed to be the leading figure among the rioters alongside Suredha Suraweera who was also arrested. Ampitiye Sumanarathana Thera was also seen alongside Amith during the riot and also demanded the release of those arrested by the police but the thera was not arrested. Sumanarathana thera is known for his active participation in violence against Tamils and Muslims. Further the main suspects were brought to Colombo for further enquiries.
A panel of three retired judges are set to be appointed by the Sri Lankan President to probe into the anti-Muslim riots to inquire into the incidents which held in areas such as Digana, Teldeniya.
The newly appointed law and order minister, Ranjith Madduma Bandara stated that the current Sri Lankan government is planning to fresh legislation to ensure a code of conduct for the operation of social media networks in Sri Lanka in accordance with the international practices to avoid unethical false claims, rumours which have been spread by many suspicious people through social media. The minister also said that the law enforcement authorities and agencies have arrested people for conducting alleged hate campaigns regarding the ethnic riots between Muslims and Buddhists which prevailed in Kandy for about a week.
Poilce raided the Mahason Balakaya office at Naththaranpotha in Kundasale after interrogating Amith Weerasinghe which revealed bottles used to make petrol bombs as well as equipment and propaganda materials such as leaflets, posters, notices, letters, banners, a large number of documents and wristbands, which were used in propagating hate speech. Further the police found computer central processing units (CPUs), several bank accounts, bank slips and several vehicle permits.
Ampara.
Obstetricians and gynaecologists denied that pills can cause permanent sterility and stressed the need of surgical procedures such as vasectomy on males and tubal ligation surgery on females to cause permanent sterility. Director General of Health Services Dr. Anil Jasinghe also released a statement denying the existence of a method to sterilize a person through pills. Sri Lankan lecturer Dr. Mohamed Najimudeen from Melaka Manipal Medical College in Malaysia has also offered a prize of Rs. 1,000,000 to anyone able to prove sterilization medicines are being added to clothes or food in the country by various individuals. Health minister Rajitha Senaratne also claimed that there are no such medicines ever discovered to sterilize a male.
Dr. Razia Pendse, the World Health Organization representative in Sri Lanka issued a state claiming, "There is no medication or 'pills' currently known or available that can permanently make a human being sterile. The information on the use of an 'infertility pill' or 'sterilization pill' mixed with food is baseless with no scientific evidence". United Nations Population Fund Sri Lanka Representative Ritsu Nacken in her statement noted that the incidents show the lack of access to accurate reproductive health information in Sri Lanka.
Sociologists and senior lecturers at University of Sri Jayewardenepura's Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Dr. Praneeth Abeysundara and B.A. Tennyson Perera, called for authorities and media to create awareness and dialogues among community leaders and clerics to counter such paranoia.
On 8 March, the country's Government Analyst's Office confirmed the contents of particles alleged to be infertility/sterilization tablets were carbohydrate-based clumps of flour.
Kandy District.
The Government urged calm on 5 March, while the Ministry of Education ordered the closure of schools in the Kandy District. It also imposed a State of Emergency (the first since 2011) over the country on 6 March for a period of 10 days, granting the state powers to arrest and detain suspects indefinitely, and deploy armed forces at its will. The CID was tasked with an investigation into the event and its background.
The police came under heavy criticism for its failure to impose order and its alleged hesitation in preventing property damage at the start of the riots. Several government and opposition MPs criticized the police and its decision-making, while others called for calm and harsh punishments to perpetrators of racially motivated violence. A group of Sinhalese Buddhist citizens and Buddhist clergy held a protest outside the Digana police station on 6 March demanding the release of all suspects arrested for their involvement in the riots. The government and the opposition party Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna alleged an organized, political effort to inflame sectarian tensions in Kandy. The Bodu Bala Sena, at the center of the 2014 riots, accused the public of unfairly linking it to incidents of communal violence in the country as BBS was earlier accused and criticised by the critics and other political leaders for aggravating the violence between Muslims and Buddhists, which was later revealed that Bodu Bala Sena was unnecessarily blamed for the incident. BBS Secretary General Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara visited the assault victim's home on 4 March, and claimed he had urged residents of the area to remain calm.
In an effort to prevent mobs from organizing online through social media platforms, internet access to the Kandy District was restricted by order of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC). Access to Facebook was blocked, and the Ministry of Defence instructed the TRC to report on individuals spreading hate speech on social media platforms. The Centre for Policy Alternatives, a think-tank based in Colombo, released a statement claiming videos containing "false information" that sought to incite sectarian violence were going viral online.
Following the violence in Kandy, several foreign tourists have cancelled their visits to the historic Kandy town. This was evident despite the attempts taken by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority to provide further updates to the foreign tourists about the country's current situation. But the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority stated that Kandy is returning to the normal situation and foreign tourists could resume their visits to the country.
The riots affected both Sinhalese and Muslim communities in the areas with businesses run by Sinhalese in properties rented from Muslims being also burned by the mobs. After the riots ended citizens of Balagalla joined to help the Muslims affected by the riots. Pathadumbara Thalpotha Dhammajothi Thera the Chief Incumbent of the Balagolla Viharaya organized efforts to provide dry rations to Muslim families displaced due to riots. Many Buddhist monks also visited Muslim churches during the Friday prayers in 9 March to express solidarity with Muslims. An organization with the name, Citizens Against Racism has staged a peaceful protests on 8 March 2018 to combat ethnic minority violence in the country. Hundreds of Buddhists monks from the National Bhikku Front also launched a peaceful protest in Colombo accusing the rioters of destroying national unity.
In addition Sinhalese and Buddhist volunteers actively participated in reconstruction efforts and one Muslim owned eatery which was set ablaze by rioters was repaired by over 300 volunteers with around 200 being Sinhalese within 12 hours attracting media attention
The schools in the administrative Kandy District were re-opened on 12 March 2018 (Monday) following the gradual improvement in Kandy after the communal violence. The schools had been closed for about one week since 5 March 2018 due to the imposition of the state of emergency.
Australia, Denmark, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States issued travel advisories warning their citizens to remain vigilant, avoid large crowds and protests, and to follow instructions by local authorities.
Sri Lankan cricketers including Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Sanath Jayasuriya strongly condemned the situation, and asked the populace to come together to make the country united again. Former Sri Lankan cricketer, Muttiah Muralitharan pointed that his family members are feeling safe in Kandy and also said that there is no need to worry about the country following the declaration of the state of emergency.
Former Sri Lankan president, Mahinda Rajapaksa accused and blamed the government for not acting in a more responsive manner to control the ethnic riots. He further mentioned that some cabinet ministers tried to blame the police officials rather than being responsible to control and manage the unusual situation which has spread in the nation. Further, Mahinda Rajapaksa has also been reported to have met the heads of diplomatic missions of few Islamic countries in order to discuss about the communal violence which erupted in the nation a few weeks ago. In addition, he also went onto visit Kandy on 9 March 2018 to discuss about the current situation in the area following the violence.
Indian test cricketer, Ravichandran Ashwin has also deeply expressed his condolences and disarray towards the people of Sri Lanka and pointed out that Sri Lankan people of any cast are generally good. He further mentioned in his Twitter account, Sri Lanka would become great again after sometime. Human rights activist, Meenakshi Ganguly from India has also warned the Sri Lankan government for not taking immediate actions to eradicate communal violences in the nation.
Economic Impact.
The riots negatively impacted the Economy of Sri Lanka as well as the local economy of Kandy. In addition to the destruction of many shops employing both Sinhalese and Muslims many tourists cancelled visits to Sri Lanka which heavily depends on the tourism industry.
The violence in Kandy affected the Nuwara Eliya season in April where there was a 40% drop in tourist arrivals both local and foreign compared to the last year. Tourism Development Minister John Amaratunga planned to invite Ambassadors of the various countries that imposed travel advisories with a site visit for diplomats mainly from the European and Middle Eastern nations on 13–14 May with cultural events and tours to assure them about the country returning to normalcy.

Wilhelm Vauck

Wilhelm Vauck (* 8 October 1896 in Neustadt, Dresden, † 8 December 1968 in Bautzen) was a German mathematician, physicist and university lecturer in physics and electrical engineering. During World War II, Vauck was the director of the agents Referat within the Funkabwehr, the German Armies radio counter-intelligence organisation. As an anti-nazi, Vauck's work on the discovery of the Rote Kapelle anti-fascist resistance group during World War II, burdened him deeply until the end of his life.
Life.
After World War I finished, Vauck undertook study of mathematics and physics at the Technical University of Dresden. In 1922, he passed the exam for a higher education office, and two years later, under supervision of Gerhard Kowalewski, Vauck was promoted to Dr. phil with a thesis titled "A generalisation of Bolzano's continuous but non-differentiable function" () which is within Mathematics Subject Classification 26 Real functions.
Vauck's first career position was as a teacher at the secondary school in Thum and then from 1926 as a teacher at the secondary school in Bautzen. After the war from 1948, he became a teacher in Bautzen and later became a lecturer in physics and electrical engineering at the engineering school in Bautzen.
Military career.
During his military career, Vauck held the rank of Oberleutnant. In the spring of 1942, Vauck was ordered to report to In 7/VI to attend a cryptographic course. He proved to be a very able cryptographer and was selected to be Head of Unit () of Referat "Agenten" or Referat Agent in OKH/In 7/VI/12 or Referat 12 of In 7/VI. This referat had just been formed and had to be commanded by an officer so that its interests could be properly represented to other agencies. Vauck spent four weeks becoming familiar with the practical work of the unit. The Referat would eventually be called Referat Vauck, due to its successes discovering anti-fascist organisations.
Red Orchestra.
Vauck lead the team at Referat 12 that would eventually discover the German anti-fascist network that would later be called the Red Orchestra () by the Abwehr. Dr Vauck succeeded in decrypting around 200 messages of the Rote Kapelle. The first discovery of the network was the discovery of the woman agent, Rita Arnould on 12–13 December 1941, which later led to the locating of radio operator Johann Wenzel, the second discovery. On 15 July 1942, the discovery that lead to the full realisation of the size and complexity of Rote Kappelle was made, when a message was deciphered. On that date, Vauck successfully deciphered a message. It had the format:
that was decoded into;
"KENT from Director Personal. Proceed immediately Berlin three addresses indicated and determine causes failure radio connections. If interruptions recur take over broadcasts. Work three Berlin groups and transmission information top priority. Addresses: Nwuwestend, Altenburger allee 19, third right; Coro Charlottenburg, Frederikstrasse 26a second left, Wolf-Friedenau, Kaiserstrasse 18 fourth left. Bauer. Call name here "Eulenspiegel" Remind Bauer of book gave to Erdberg as present before the war and of play Till Eulenspiegel. Password Director. Report progress 20 October. New (repeat new) plan in force for three stations."
When Vauck decrypted this message, it was forwarded to Reich Security Main Office IV 2A, where they easily identified the persons living at the three addresses and from 16 July 1942 were put under surveillance. Unknown to Vauck, there was also a informer working in Referat 12 in Vauck's team, Corporal Horst Heilmann, who was supplying Harro Schulze-Boysen (Coro) with intelligence. Heilmann tried to contact Schulze-Boysen but was unsuccessful and left a message with his wife to phone him back. Schulze-Boysen eventually did this, but Heilmann was absent. However Vauck answered the phone and when he requested the name of the caller to take a message, and was met with "Schulze-Boysen", who was already identified as CORO, the deception was revealed, and Heilmann was arrested.

These writings were published in two anthologies by the Zimbabwe Women Writers in Shona, Masimba and a version in isiNdebele. 7
Her most popular published works include:
"Destiny" (Corals Services, 2006). A book on Destiny that deals with a subject that is viewed as taboo in Zimbabwe - Hermaphrodites (LGBTI community) and their everyday reality.

James B. Dutton House

The James B. Dutton House was built as a single-family house located at 605 Calhoun Street in Lapeer, Michigan. It is now the Calhoun Apartments. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.
History.
This house was constructed between 1863 and 1864 for James B. Dutton, a lawyer and insurance agent in Lapeer during the town's period of early prosperity and growth. In 1869, the house passed to Oliver and Mary P. Nichols, the owners of a local hardware store. The Nicholses lived in the house until 1892, when it was purchased by the Presbyterian Church, whose sanctuary is located two blocks away. The church used the house as a manse until 1955. After this use ended, the house was converted into apartments.
Description.
The James B. Dutton House is a T-shaped, wood-framed structure sitting on a stone foundation. The house is sited on a corner. The stem of the "T" contains a five-sided first floor bay window ornamented with dentils, paired brackets, and arched window surrounds.

2018 IAAF Continental Cup

The 2018 IAAF Continental Cup is an international track and field sporting event that was held in Ostrava, Czech Republic, on 8–9 September 2018.
It is the third edition of the IAAF Continental Cup since the name and format was changed from the IAAF World Cup.
Format.
The four teams competing in the event were Africa, the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe. The two-day competition comprised a programme of 20 track and field events for men and women, giving a total of 40 events. Each team shall enter two athletes in each event, except for relays where one team competed, with a maximum of one athlete from each country per event.
Teams were selected as follows:
Many events were conducted in elimination fashion. Field events were given three attempts to qualify to a semi-final round, where the best representative from each continental team was given one more attempt. The top two then had one more attempt for the championship, head to head. The 3000 metre and steeplechase running events were conducted in a "devil take the hindmost" fashion, where the last place runner in the last three laps of the race, was eliminated. Additionally, the ceremonial team captains were allowed to apply a "joker" to one male and female event through the competition. If the team won the individual points from the event, that team's score would be doubled.
Team captains:
Scoring was based on team points earned in an 8-6-4-2 fashion based on the places of individual points. The individual points were distributed 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 based on the places of finishing athletes. After those points were tallied, then team points were calculated. Ties divide points based on the total of both places. Example: If team A fished 1st and 5th they would get 8 + 4 = 12 points. Team B finished 2nd and 3rd would get 7 + 6 = 13 and would win that event. So Team B would get 8 team points, Team A, 6 points. If Team B were to have played their Joker, they would get 16 points. Had Team A's athlete finished in 4th, it would be a tie with 13 individual points each and the team points would be (8 + 6 / 2) 7 each, and with the Joker, Team B would get 14.
Athletes were encouraged to be fan friendly. As a result many played to the crowd.

Operation Burlington Trail

Operation Burlington Trail was a security operation conducted during the Vietnam War by the U.S. 198th Infantry Brigade in Quảng Nam Province, South Vietnam from 8 April to 11 November 1968. 
Background.
In early April 1968, the 198th Infantry Brigade moved into the Quế Sơn Valley to replace the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division. On arriving the Brigade was tasked with assisting the 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment and the 39th Engineer Battalion in reopening Route 533 between Tam Kỳ and Tiên Phước Camp, 20 kilometers to the southwest. Units of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 2nd Division would also assist in searching the Viet Cong (VC) Base Area 117 in the mountains south of Route 533, which was believed to shelter the 72nd Main Force Battalion and the 74th Local Force Battalion.
Operation.
The operation began on 8 April when Companies C and D 1st Battalion, 46th Infantry Regiment were landed on two hilltops overlooking Route 533 10km southwest of Tam Kỳ. 
On 9 April the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment was landed on Hill 218, several km west of the 1/46th Infantry positions. The 1/6th Infantry began constructing Firebase Bowman () to serve as the main fire support base for the operation. Meanwhile Troop A and a platoon from Troop C 1/1st Cavalry, began their advance along Route 533 towards Tiên Phước. The column was ambushed by elements of the VC 72nd Main Force Battalion, but the Cavalry fought through the ambush, killing 33 VC and capturing 4. 
On 10 April, a VC mortar attack hit Firebase Bowman, killing 2 Americans and wounding 8. On the afternoon of 13 April Company A 1/6th Infantry, engaged a VC platoon 5 kilometers southwest of Firebase Bowman killing 7 VC while another 19 were killed by air strikes. That evening, the VC launched an attack on Company B 1/6th Infantry's night defensive position, wounding 22 Americans.
On 14 April the Cavalry column reached Tiên Phước and by 17 April Route 533 was open to regular traffic. 
Later in April the remaining companies of the 1/46th Infantry joined the operation together with Company A, 1st Battalion, 52nd Infantry Regiment, which assumed responsibility for the defense of Firebase Bowman. 
On 30 April, a VC force attacked Firebase Bowman losing 4 dead and wounding 8 defenders. On 1 May, Company A 1/46th Infantry, was landed 11km southwest of Bowman and was engaged by a VC force, the VC lost 31 dead before disengaging. 
On 23 July elements of the 1/1st Cavalry engaged the VC 105th Local Force Company and elements of the VC 2nd Division’s engineer battalion near the southern entrance to the Quế Sơn Valley, 10km northeast of Tam Kỳ killing 68 VC.
The operation continued until 11 November 1968.
Aftermath.
VC losses were 1,931 killed, while U.S. losses were 129 killed.

James F. Fairweather–Jacob C. Lamb House

The James F. Fairweather–Jacob C. Lamb House is a private house located at 540 South Almont Avenue in Imlay City, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.
History.
The Fairweather family settled in Imlay City in the early 1860s, and by 1864 was farming on land south of town. At about that time one family member, James F. Fairweather, started a drygoods business in town. Although settled much earlier, Imlay City was not actually platted until 1870, when the Port Huron and Lake Michigan Railroad constructed a line through the settlement. The arrival of the railroad created a business boom, and in 1871 James Fairweather purchased a lot in town, and by 1874 had this house constructed.
In 1879 James F. Fairweather ended his business, sold his home, and apparently moved from Imlay City. The new owner of the house was Jacob C. Lamb, who was born in Burlington County, New Jersey in 1828 and had settled in Dryden, Michigan in 1854. He began farming, and also ran a mercantile business dealing in wool with his brother. By 1867 he was dealing over 250,000 pounds of wool, and in 1871 constructed a grain elevator in Imlay City, and in 1876 an evaporator used to dry fruit. Lamb maintained his house in Dryden until 1878, when he moved into this house in Imlay City. He continued his various business enterprises, and by 1880 ran one of the county's largest businesses, with a yearly income of over $250,000.
Lamb and his family owned this house until 1907, when it was sold to the Hovey family. In 1922, Mark Cheney, the village's tax assessor, bought the house. It remained in the Cheney family for many years.
Description.
This house is a two-story wood frame Gothic Revival structure covered with clapboard. It has an L-shaped plan with a tower-like projection in the front containing the entrance. Two single-story additions are in the rear, constructed in the late 19th and early 20th century. The original portion of the home is three bays wide, each topped with a steep gable containing ornamental bargeboards in the gable ends. The elaborate detailing includes Gothic pointed arch door and window enframements, and single- and two-story bay windows.
The interior includes a center stair surrounded by a living room, foyer and parlor, and a library/sunroom. The dining room, kitchen, and bath are in the rear addition. On the second floor, the floor plan echoes the lower story, with three bedrooms and a sewing room aligned with the major rooms downstairs.

Spain in Our Hearts

Spain in Our Hearts: Americans in the Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939 is a non-fiction book by Adam Hochschild that was first published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt on March 29, 2016. The book is an account of the American volunteers who participated in the Spanish Civil War from 1936 to 1939. The story centers around several American volunteer fighters and journalists, tracing their motivations for joining the war and their experiences during the war which left many disillusioned. The book explains the involvement of foreign leaders including Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Joseph Stalin, and explains why the Republican faction ultimately lost.
Hochschild knew several American volunteers personally, and was partly inspired by them to write the book. Most of Hochschild's archival research on the subject was carried out at the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives.
"Spain in Our Hearts" was generally well received by critics. Hochschild's writing in particular, was praised for being compelling and well-researched. Many reviewers also commended the book's balanced perspective that covers the atrocities committed by both factions in the war. In his lukewarm review, William Deresiewicz felt that the book did not provide adequate context for the war, leaving many of the questions the book raises unanswered.
Background and development.
Adam Hochschild is an American author and co-founder of the progressive American magazine "Mother Jones". Much of his writing focuses on historical social injustices and the individuals who campaigned to end them. Hochschild said of the overarching theme in his work: "To me there's nothing more interesting than trying to evoke moments when men and women risked their lives to battle horrendous injustice [...] It's hard for me to imagine spending four or five years working on a book if there isn't some pressing moral issue at the core of the story." A popular historian, Hochschild has stated that his intention is not to provide new analyses of historical events with his books, but rather "to bring a period of time alive by focusing on 10 or 12 people who lived through it, and whose lives intersected in some way." Hochschild's previous books include the acclaimed "King Leopold's Ghost", an account of the colonial atrocities committed in the Belgian Congo; "The Unquiet Ghost: Russians Remember Stalin", an account of the effects of Joseph Stalin's dictatorship on contemporary Russians; and "Bury the Chains", an account of the anti-slavery movement in the British Empire.
Hochschild was first drawn to write about the Spanish Civil War due to his personal associations with several Americans who had volunteered in the war. Hochschild's interest in the topic was deepened by his high regard for "Homage to Catalonia", George Orwell's personal account of his experiences in the war, as well as Hochschild's observation that the war was the only time that many Americans had risked their lives in another nation's civil war.
Hochschild began his research for "Spain in Our Hearts" by spending months reading books and articles about the participation of American volunteers in the Spanish Civil War, so as to determine the main characters in his book. After narrowing down the focus of his book, Hochschild conducted extensive archival research, particularly at the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives, whose collection includes the writings of hundreds of the American volunteers. While visiting the Hoover Institution Library and Archives, Hochschild was introduced to the writings of Lois Orr who then became a major character in his book.
Title.
The title for the book is taken from a quote by French philosopher Albert Camus on the Spanish Civil War: "Men of my generation have had Spain in our hearts. It was there that they learned ... that one can be right and yet be beaten, that force can vanquish spirit and that there are times when courage is not rewarded."
Content.
"Spain in Our Hearts" is an account of the American volunteers who participated in the Spanish Civil War. The civil war was fought between the left-leaning Republicans who were loyal to the democratically elected Second Spanish Republic, and the right-wing Nationalists who were led by General Francisco Franco. While the Nationalists were backed by foreign fascist leaders Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, the Republicans were not supported by other Western democratic governments due to their communist-leaning ideologies. Despite this, many left-wing Americans volunteered to fight on the side of the Republicans, forming the Lincoln Battalion of the International Brigades. The book is told as a collective biography of several American volunteers and journalists, namely, Robert Hale Merriman, an Economics doctoral student who commandeered the Lincoln Battalion; Lois Orr, a member of the POUM female militia; and journalists Ernest Hemingway, Louis Fischer and Virginia Cowles. George Orwell, a British novelist and volunteer fighter in the POUM militia, and Jason Gurney, a British sculptor who fought in the International Brigades, are also major characters. Merriman serves as the central figure and the book begins with his disappearance during battle in April 1938.
Hochschild explains the motivations of the American volunteers, who fought on the side of the Republicans due to their opposition to fascism and their support of communism. Severely lacking in equipment and training, the Lincoln Battalion suffered heavy losses such as in the Battle of Brunete in 1937. While the Republicans received limited aid from Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union, the arms embargo that the United States, United Kingdom and France had imposed on Spain meant that they could not buy the weapons needed to fight against the Nationalists, who were being armed by Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy. As such, Hochschild explains that many of the Republicans' attacks and strategies were not made for the purpose of direct victory, but instead were meant to convince Western powers to commit to supporting them.
Hochschild discusses the impact Texaco chairman, Torkild Rieber, had on the civil war. Rieber was sympathetic to fascist regimes and illegally supplied cheap oil on credit to the Nationalists in direct violation of the American arms embargo. Hochschild explains how Stalinist repressed the non-communist leftists and anti-Stalinist POUM members, which in turn disillusioned many of the American volunteers. George Orwell was inspired by the experience to write "Homage to Catalonia", and anti-Stalinism was a key theme in his later works such as "Animal Farm" and "Nineteen Eighty-Four".
Hochschild points out that Hitler and Mussolini used the Spanish Civil War to test out weapons and strategies that they would later employ in World War II. This includes the 1937 bombing of Guernica which was the first ever aerial bombing of civilians by a military air force. Hochschild concludes that Western intervention would have prevented the Nationalist victory in the civil war, but ultimately would not have prevented World War II. The book's final chapter details Merriman's death, with quotes from his widow's letters, and ends with an American woman travelling in 2012 to an old battleground site to honor her uncle's death in 1938.
Critical response.
"Spain in Our Hearts" received many positive reviews for its "exceptional" and "moving" narrative, particularly its prose that historian Michael Kazin described in "The New York Times" as "consistently vivid yet emotionally restrained." In a lukewarm review, "Harper's Magazine"s William Deresiewicz was critical of the book for not providing sufficient background and context to the war, citing its "rush narrative" that left many questions unanswered. Rich Benjamin, writing for "The Guardian", felt that while the book sheds little new information about the war, overall, Hochschild provides new insight into the conflict through his gifted storytelling, deep knowledge of military history and "beautiful sense of private hurt." Other reviewers enjoyed the pace of the book and felt that it was well-researched.
Many reviewers also praised the book for providing a "nuanced" and "unromantic" perspective of the war that does not gloss over the atrocities both sides committed despite Hochschild's clear sympathy for the Republic's cause. The book's focus on the perspective of the American volunteers in an "often overlooked" conflict was described by Kazin as unique and by journalist Bob Drogin as "long-overdue". Hochschild's revelations on the little-known involvement of Texaco chairman Torkild Rieber in bankrolling the Nationalists was also commended. Author Kevin Baker wanted Hochschild to cover a wider perspective, but conceded that doing so would have meant losing the "shining courage and tenacity" that Hochschild evokes from his characters' personal stories. On the other hand, the World Socialist Web Site's reviewer considered Hochschild to have a poor grasp on the wider political issues surrounding the Spanish Civil War, asserting that the book perpetuates pro-Stalinist propaganda and understates the Republic's repression of POUM members.
The main characters, many of whom are little known, were considered compelling by reviewers. Hochschild's use of writings from the warranging from reports by writers such as Ernest Hemingway and André Malraux, to letters between Martha Gellhorn and Eleanor Rooseveltwas seen as a strength that enhanced the book. The "Los Angeles Review of Books" also gave Hochschild credit for "giv[ing] voice" to obscure writers through his comprehensive archival work that unyielded the previously unpublished writings of numerous American volunteers.
"The New Republic" was very complimentary of the book, declaring that it surpasses George Orwell's "Homage to Catalonia" as the "best introduction" to the Spanish Civil War written in English.

Società Nazionale Officine di Savigliano

Società Nazionale Officine di Savigliano (SNOS), also known as Savigliano, was one of the most prestigious Italian industrial companies of the twentieth century. It had interests in many sectors including mechanical and electrical engineering. It was founded in Turin on 17 July 1880, with a share capital of one million lire, with the aim of undertaking the "construction and repair of railway material, metal bridges, canopies, mechanical, electrical and aeronautical constructions as well as woodworking. generally".
History.
The origins of Savigliano are intertwined with those of one of the first Piedmontese railway companies, the Società della Ferrovia Torino-Cuneo, which had built a workshop for the maintenance and repair of its rolling stock next to Savigliano station. In 1869, with the transfer of ownership of the line to the Società per le Ferrovie dell'Alta Italia (SFAI), the workshop was closed. On 14 December 1879, the municipality of Savigliano signed a memorandum of understanding with the SFAI, pledging to pay a considerable sum of money, and rented the abandoned workshop of the Turin-Cuneo railway to a Belgian company building railway material, enabling it to resume activity.
Production.
On 17 July 1880 the Società Nazionale Officine di Savigliano was founded in Turin, with headquarters in Savigliano, which rapidly expanded to take on 640 employees and make a monthly production of over fifty rolling stock units commissioned by various railway companies such as SFAI, Ferrovie Romane and Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits. The elegant sleeping cars produced for the latter were presented at the Turin Exhibition in 1884. In 1889, SNOS merged with the Società Anonima Italiana Ausiliare, a Turin-based company competing with the related facilities located in Corso Mortara near Torino Dora station. This led to a further expansion of production that, on the threshold of the First World War, also embraced electrical and mechanical machinery as well as metal constructions such as bridges and viaducts in many foreign countries. The period between 1915 and 1918 saw Savigliano strongly engaged in war production with activities in the nascent aeronautical sector, war equipment, cannons and ammunition.
The post-war period saw the SNOS engaged in extensive production of large metal structures such as the roof of the new Milan Central station, electromechanical cranes for the major Italian ports and electric locomotives for both three-phase alternating current and direct current. The Ethiopian campaign had seen it strongly involved both in war production and in the construction of infrastructure of all kinds but, in the Second World War there was greater involvement in sectors such as radio and telephone field transmissions. Like other large industries, Savigliano's plants had suffered war damage but, by 1948, it had resumed supplies to the State Railways that were commissioning the production of rolling stock of all kinds.
Takeover by Fiat.
Soon afterwards, Fiat took a shareholding in the company and this gradually increased until FIAT had total corporate control. In 1970, the plants in Turin and Savigliano were separated, the latter becoming Fiat Ferroviaria Savigliano. Savigliano was then taken over by a group of large electromechanical companies, including General Electric, Ercole Marelli and Ansaldo. In the 1980s, Savigliano became a leader in the electromechanical sector in Italy and the Mediterranean. After other changes of ownership at the end of the twentieth century it becomes Savigliano SpA and this was followed by divestments and downsizing.
High-speed trains.
Among the most prestigious constructions of the Savigliano railway plant were the prototypes E.444.001-004, the first high-speed electric locomotives of the Ferrovie dello Stato, delivered between 1967 and 1968 with the Savigliano brand, and the electric train ETR.401, progenitor of the Pendolino tilting train family, delivered in 1976 with the FIAT Ferroviaria Savigliano brand following the spin-off from SNOS.
Sale to Alstom.
On 1 August 2000, the prestigious plant was sold to Alstom and this marked the final exit of FIAT from the railway sector.

Kenridge, Bellville

Kenridge is a suburb in Bellville, Western Cape, South Africa. It became a suburb out of one of the Tygerberg’s original farms.
History.
On 17 October 1714, the Governor of the Cape Colony award the farm Blommesteijn to Theuns Dirksz van Schalkwyk. Van Schalkwyk was a Dutch immigrant. In September 1732, the farm was granted to van Schalkwyk’s daughter Anna Dirksz Brommert (Nee van Schalkwyk). At the same time Anna also received Door de Kraal farm, which previously belonged to Tryntje Theuinisse. These two farms became one and was known as Door de Kraal. Johan Albrecht Dell was the new owner in 1814. Cornelis Valkenburg de Villiers bought the farm in 1866, and his son JH de Villiers inherited it in 1899. He divided the farm in four parts; one part remained Door de Kraal, one part he sold to Hume Pipe Company (This company mined clay in Bellville's Quarry), one part he gave his son JJH de Villiers (it was called de Bron) and the fourth part to PHT de Villiers (it was called Witboom). PHT de Villiers sold Witboom for residential development in 1948. It then became Kenridge. (PHT de Villiers part was the old Blommesteijn farm).
Municipal dispute.
In 1969, a dispute arose between the municipalities of Bellville and Durbanville, as to under whose jurisdiction Kenridge fell. In January 1971, it was decided that Kenridge fell under Bellville and the area closer to Durbanville under their jurisdiction. The Durbanville area was then called Kenridge Heights.
Schools.
Only one school is in the area namely Kenridge Primary. An old farm cowshed was not yet demolished in 1954. In January 1955, the school started in the cowshed. It was called "old Barn". The school was official opened by P Swiegelaar on 20 September 1956. Head Masters through the years were: (1955-1957) P. Marsford, (1957-1971)F.Swiegelaar, (1971- 1972) L. Hoorn, (1972- 1989) G. F. van Wyk,(1989- 1993) M. Lötter, (1993- 2010) G.V. Albrecht and from 2010 S. Smith. Jacobus Johannes (Koos) de Villiers owner of the farm Morgenster Durbanville hills and husband of endurance horse rider Gillese Hayward.
was one of the first pupils.
Surrounding suburbs.
It is surrounded by fellow Bellville suburbs, Eversdal and Door-de-Kraal. As it is on the border of Bellville, it has a Durbanville neighbouring suburb called Durbanville Hills and Kenridge Heights.
Notable residents.
All of them also attend Kenridge Primary
Climate.
It rains primarily in the winter, with average rainfall of 465mm per year. It seldom gets colder than 7 °C and its average temperature in the months of November to February is 26 °C to 27 °C.

Heart Is Full

"Heart Is Full" is a song recorded by Swedish indie pop band Miike Snow for their third studio album, "iii" (2016). Written by the band alongside Vincent Pontare, the song contains elements from Marlena Shaw's 1967 recording of "Waiting for Charlie to Come Home", penned by Bob Hilliard and Burt Bacharach. "Heart Is Full" is an electropop and hip hop song with instrumentation provided by drums, horn and Wurlitzer electric piano. Described by the band as different from their other work, the song was selected as the album's lead single as vocalist Andrew Wyatt deemed it a "jarring reintroduction" following the band's three-year break. The single was released on 30 October 2015 through Jackalope and Atlantic.
"Heart Is Full" received mixed reviews from critics; some applauded the use of the sample combined with the hip hop beat, while others felt it was uninspired as a whole. The single became the band's first entry on the American Hot Rock Songs chart, peaking at number 41. Elsewhere, it managed to chart at number 194 in France. The accompanying music video was directed by Lance Drake and pays homage to several works of science fiction. An official remix of "Heart Is Full" featuring American rap duo Run the Jewels was released on 20 November 2015.
Background.
"Heart Is Full" was written by Miike Snow's three members, Christian Karlsson, Pontus Winnberg and Andrew Wyatt, in collaboration with Vincent Pontare, for the band's third studio album, "iii" (2016). Bob Hilliard and Burt Bacharach received writing credits due to the inclusion of the "Waiting for Charlie to Come Home" sample, as performed by Marlena Shaw. The song is built upon a pre-existing instrumental hip hop track, a basis from which the band had not worked before. Pontare suggested using the instrumental, which utilized Shaw's vocal snippets. The band offered to credit the track's unspecified producer, but they declined as they did not have clearance to sample Shaw. The band then cleared it properly for "Heart Is Full". Wyatt explained to "Rolling Stone" that the song is a "total departure" from the band's previous albums and asserted, "I think we challenged ourselves and we still ended up making stuff that's good. I think if people have an open mind, then they'll probably still be satisfied, but in a different way than they were with 'Animal'." He perceived its sound as "interesting", calling it a combination of a "Troggs song and a Just Blaze beat". He felt that he "hadn't heard that before" and that the song "deserved a place on the album".
Musician Danger Mouse suggested to Wyatt to select "Heart Is Full" as the album's lead single. As the band had not released a single in over three years, Wyatt viewed it as "the most jarring reintroduction" they could opt for. In an interview for "Spin", Winnberg argued a standout track like "Heart Is Full" is best used as a lead single, "If you have one track like that, that really stands out from the rest, isn't [first] the best place to put it? Rather than to have it somewhere floating around in the back? That's more of a fun thing to do." The band debuted the full track on Zane Lowe's radio show "World Record" on Apple Music's station Beats 1 on 29 October 2015. Soon thereafter, the song became available for streaming on Miike Snow's YouTube channel, followed by a digital release the next day.
Composition and lyrics.
Musically, "Heart Is Full" is a mid-tempo electropop and hip hop song with funk, jazz and pop rock influences. It contains elements of Marlena Shaw's 1967 rendition of "Waiting for Charlie to Come Home" and instrumentation based on drums, horn, percussion, synths and Wurlitzer electric piano. The piece incorporates "blaring, brass-blasted soul snippets" of Shaw, including "Wha!" outbursts as part of its backing. Describing the record, Wyatt stated, "The thing I like about 'Heart Is Full' is that it's kind of like a 60s garage music song like Troggs or something over a 90s hip hop beat." According to Rawiya Kameir of "The Fader", the drum arrangement recalls DJ Premier. Similarly, Alex Gale of "Billboard" wrote that is sounds "like a DJ Premier remix, with a chopped-up soul sample and huge drums giving Wyatt's Auto-Tuned pop-rock hook a muscular jolt". Lyrically, the song speaks of promising to commit to a woman. The chorus sees Wyatt singing "Please don't knock over my heart / Because my heart is full of you".
Reception.
"Heart Is Full" received mixed reviews from music critics. Michelle Geslani, writing for "Consequence of Sound", viewed the single as a "bold comeback track" and complimented its "rich, soul samples, thundering beats, and larger-than-life melodies that'll make you forget Miike Snow was ever gone to begin with". Both AllMusic's Neil Z. Yeung and Eric Renner Brown of "Entertainment Weekly" perceived it as a highlight on "iii"; Yeung described it as "bombastic" while Renner Brown deemed it "the album's wildest highlight". Ben Hogwood of musicOMH called "Heart Is Full" an "excellent" song, praising it for combining the Shaw sample with "broad hip hop beats". Sean Maunier of "Metro Weekly" viewed the single as "powerful" and applauded the integration of the sample, and Alex Hudson of "Exclaim!" praised the catchiness of the chorus.
"Clash" writer Luke Winstanley was more critical of the single, writing that it "feels particularly contrived". He critiqued the "uninspired" use of the sample which he believed "doesn't add anything". Rachel Brodsky of "Spin" also had a negative view of the song, arguing that it "just doesn't know what rhythm it wants to ride". She wrote, "Ostensibly, everything about the "iii" lead single should work — that full-figured 'Wha!' outburst, with its accompanying horns and slow-stomping percussion. But the song's start-stop-start construction never delivers the payoff to justify the auditory whiplash it gives the listener."
Commercially, the single achieved minor chart success. It became Miike Snow's first entry on the French singles chart, debuting and peaking at number 194. It is also the band's first single to chart in the United States, with a peak position of number 41 on the Hot Rock Songs chart. Additionally, "Heart Is Full" peaked at number 19 on two of "Billboard" charts ranked by digital sales, Alternative Digital Songs and Rock Digital Songs.
Music video.
Lance Drake directed the accompanying music video for "Heart Is Full". Drake told "Entertainment Weekly" that he was inspired by several works of fiction, including "Ghost in the Shell", "The Fifth Element" and "Mortal Kombat". He said, "For the video, we wanted to create a world loaded with zillions of comic book, sci-fi, and video game references from my childhood fantasies. Nearly every frame has a small homage." Drake's goal was to create "fierce, female characters in total control of an over-the-top world". The video sees Braina Laviena in the lead role, which he described as having "a killer charm and a stealth sensitivity.” The video begins with Laviena standing atop a skyscraper, overlooking the city's skyline. In the next scene, she is chasing a man while doing cartwheels. She ultimately kills the man with a projectile weapon in the shape of a jackalope and steals his car keys. She arrives at the hideout of another woman, portrayed by Akemi Look, showing her she killed the man. This angers Look and the two have a showdown where Laviena kills Look's accomplices. Following a fight, the music ends before Laviena tearfully strangles Look at a rooftop in complete silence. The music video premiered on 11 November 2015 via Miike Snow's official Facebook page. Andrew Unterberger of "Spin" interpreted the video as a "bizarre mini-action movie set in the Japanese underground". He described it as ""Blade Runner" crossed with the Crazy 88s fight scene from "[[Kill Bill: Volume 1|Kill Bill] The video also copies Miguel’s Adorn music video at the beginning
Remixes.
[[File:Run The Jewels at Treefort Music Festival.jpg|thumb|alt=An image of two male individuals performing on stage|American rap duo [[Run the Jewels]] appear on an official remix of "Heart Is Full".]]
An official remix of "Heart Is Full" featuring American hip hop duo [[Run the Jewels]], consisting of [[Killer Mike]] and [[El-P]], premiered on 19 November 2015 on "[[The Fader]]". The collaboration came about when the band heard the duo were fans of them. They asked the rappers whether they would be interested in recording a remix of "Heart Is Full", and the duo accepted, completing their lines within 72 hours. Wyatt said he was "super excited, but cautiously so" as he worried it would come off sounding "too retro". He felt that it could end up lacking progressive qualities, but said that Mike "found this riff through the song that was so perfect that you can't even classify it in a genre or a year". Wyatt explained he "couldn't stop smiling" when he first heard Mike's verse as the rapper had "found that flow, the rhythm to his lines that was undeniable". American rapper [[Young Thug]] was also in talks of appearing on the track; Wyatt said it "almost happened" while in New York, but the rapper had to leave early and the collaboration fell through.
The Run the Jewels remix was released for download on 20 November 2015. Hudson, writing for "Exclaim!", said that while the arrangement is the same as the original version, Mike and El-P "drop by for a couple of full-throttle verses, and they offer a rather twisted take on romance". "Spin" James Grebey wrote that the duo "dominat[e] the booming beat with an impact that lingers well after their verses end", and Geslani of "Consequence of Sound" said they "effectively elevate the whole thing to entirely new levels of hip-hop/soul/pop bliss". The remix appears on "iii" as a digital bonus track. Another remix produced by English DJ [[Mark Ronson]] was digitally released on 30 September 2016.

Uwe Kitzinger

Uwe Kitzinger, CBE (born 12 April 1928) is an Oxford academic specialising in International Relations. He was the first British economist at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg from 1951 to 1956, and in January 1973 to June 1975 Political Adviser to the first British Vice-President of the European Commission in Brussels, who was charged with External Relations.
Early life.
Born in Nuremberg in 1928, Uwe Kitzinger came to England as a refugee in July 1939 and was educated at Watford Grammar School for Boys, Balliol College and New College, Oxford, where he was elected President of the Oxford Union and took a First in PPE.
Career.
At the Council of Europe he worked on European economic integration including preparations for the Messina Conference, and in 1956, when Britain declined to join the European Economic Community, he returned to Oxford as Ford Research Fellow in European Politics (and later Investment Bursar) of Nuffield College. He started his lectures on the Rome Treaties five weeks after they were signed, wrote half a dozen books on European integration, founded the "Journal of Common Market Studies", and campaigned on television and in the press for Britain to join the European Communities. He also worked abroad as a Visiting Professor in the West Indies, at Paris and at Harvard.

David Frühwirth

David Frühwirth (born 15 June 1974) is an Austrian classical violinist. He has played internationally as a soloist and chamber musician, with a focus on contemporary music which he also recorded. He has given international master classes.
Life and career.
Born in Salzburg, Frühwirth began playing violin at age six. He made his debut at age eleven in the Mozarteum's great concert hall, playing Vivaldi's "Four Seasons". He studied violin in the Mozarteum in his hometown with Paul Roczek and Ruggiero Ricci. He continued his studies in Germany from 1990 to 1995 with Zakhar Bron, graduating at age 20. On an invitation of Pinchas Zukerman, he took post-graduate studies with him in New York City, completing in 1998 with honours. He advanced chamber music playing with Jaime Laredo, Isidore Cohen and Walter Levin.
Frühwirth made his debut at the Salzburg Festival in 2004, performing with pianist Henri Sigfridsson music of the 20th century, music from Korngold's opera "Das Wunder der Heliane", the "Sonata in D" by Hans Gál, William Walton's Toccata (1922/23), Korngold's Suite from his incidental music to "Much Ado About Nothing", Op. 11 (1916), and Ernst Krenek's first Violin Sonata, Op. 3 (1919). The duo performed some of these works for a recording titled "Trails of Creativity", featuring music from the interwar period. Frühwirth has played at international festivals such as Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival and Cheltenham Festival. As a chamber music player, he has worked with Jörg Widmann, Alfredo Perl and Adrian Brendel, among others. He is the first violinist of the Klenze Quartett, Munich.
In 2013, he recorded music for violin and piano by Nikolai Rakov, including three sonatas, with Milana Chernyavska. Barry Brenesal noted in Fanfare about this only recording of the music: "Frühwirth has a lean, sleekly attractive tone. He negotiates Rakov’s moderate figurations without problems, and demonstrates a convincing grasp of Rakov’s phrasing and big-hearted manner." In 2015, he participated in a concert in Landsberg am Lech of English chamber music, including the String Sextet, Op. 1, by Graham Waterhouse.
Frühwirth has given master classes internationally, including the UCSI University in Manila. He plays on a Stradivari instrument from 1707 called "ex-Brüstlein", on loan from Oesterreichische Nationalbank.

Stephanie Tyler

Stephanie Joy Tyler , also known as Steph Tyler, is a British ornithologist, zoologist, naturalist, conservationist, and author from Monmouthshire. She is particularly known for her work on Dippers and the preservation of river habitats.
Career.
Tyler gained her PhD in Zoology at University of Cambridge, where she also met and married Lyndsay Tyler, a veterinarian. Tyler's doctoral thesis was on the free-range ponies in the New Forest. Following her marriage, Tyler moved with her family to Wiltshire where she conducted a study of the area's Grey Wagtails and became the most prolific female British bird ringer. The Tyler family moved first to the United Arab Emirates and then to Ethiopia in 1973.
In Ethiopia Tyler continued her work on bird ringing and made monthly contributions to the newsletter of the
Ethiopian Wildlife and Natural History Society. Tyler also provided articles and illustrations for the conservation journal Agazen, which was used in around 2,000 schools in Ethiopia. The Tylers also led natural history tours of the area. Tyler also returned to her work on Wagtails funded by the British Ornithological Union and investigated ecological factors that affected the distribution of both local and migratory birds in Ethiopia.
From May 1976, Tyler, together with her husband and two children, were held captive for 8 months by rebels in Tigray. Despite considerable hardship, Tyler continued to make observations of local bird-life and has credited her ornithological skills with helping her family to cope with captivity. Her observations were published in the "Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club".
On her return to the UK, Tyler and her family moved to Monmouthshire where Tyler worked for Gwent Wildlife Trust and then the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds as the Conservation Officer for Wales. From the 1980s, Tyler was a committee member of Gwent Ornithological Society, regional representative for the British Trust for Ornithology, and joint plant recorder for Monmouthshire for the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre.
In the 1990s, Tyler spent five years in Botswana where she worked on nest card-filling for the new BirdLife Botswana.
Tyler was a Trustee of the Welsh Ornithological Society for eight years (2008–2015) and is currently the chair of the Monmouthshire Meadows Group.
Honours.
Tyler was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to nature conservation in the UK and Africa.

Moravian Confession is a doctrinal document of Protestants in Moravia from 1566. It is written in moderate and inclusivistic tone (sometimes referred as Philippistic or Neo-Utraquistic). It is based on Augsburg Confession and puts emphasis on church discipline (what is typical for Bohemian Reformation).
About two-thirds of Moravian Protestant clergy adhered initially to Moravian Confession. It was explicitly rejected by Unitas Fratrum (Moravian Church). The importance of the Moravian Confession soon declined, as the Augsburg Confession became prevalent in Moravia by the end of the next decade.

Bacillus methanolicus

Bacillus methanolicus ("B. methanolicus") is a gram positive, thermophilic, methylotrophic member of the genus "Bacillus". The most well characterized strain of the species, "Bacillus methanolicus" MGA3, was isolated from freshwater marsh soils, and grows rapidly in cultures heated to up to 60 °C using only methanol as a carbon source. The genome of "B. methanolicus" MGA3 was fully sequenced in 2014, revealing a 3,337,035 bp linear chromosome and two natural plasmids, pBM19 and pBM69.
Chemical production from methanol.
Researchers are currently investigating the use of "B. methanolicus" MGA3 for production of chemicals such as L-glutamate, L-lysine, cadaverine and gamma-aminobutyric acid from methanol.
Synthetic methylotrophy.
The methylotrophic metabolism of "B. methanolicus" is being explored for establishing synthetic methylotrophy in other organisms. Recombinant expression of the pentose phosphate pathway from "B. methanolicus" in "E. coli" has shown promise in creating synthetically methylotrophic "E. coli".

Soul Power (album)

Soul Power is the debut studio album by American singer Curtis Harding, released May 6, 2014, by Burger Records. It encompasses a wide breadth of genres, though it is primarily inspired by soul music and his mother's gospel singing. The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics.
Background and development.
Before "Soul Power", Curtis Harding had worked with several artists of various genres, including backing R&amp;B and hip hop recording artist CeeLo Green and collaborating with members of the rock bands Black Lips and Mastodon. As a child, Harding was influenced by his mother's gospel music while touring. He also sees the evolution of gospel music as parallel with the history of African Americans in the United States, as the foundation of many musical genres. "From hardship and trials, you make something beautiful," he told "The 405".
According to Harding, many songs of "Soul Power" are inspired by relationships with his family and friends. "It's about love, love lost," he said prior to the album's release. "It's about overcoming different things." He also said that he sought to make the album accessible to broad audiences by incorporating many genres.
Recording and release.
In 2014, Harding recorded "Soul Power" at Living Room Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, with Justin McNeight and Edward Rawls. They spent two weeks and recorded 20 songs; 12 were included on the album. Randy Michael composed the music to "Keep on Shining" (with Harding's lyrics); writer Jason Reynolds worked on two songs with Harding; and Harding co-wrote several other songs.
Burger Records released "Soul Power" on May 6, 2014. The album's cover image is a black-and-white photograph by Hedi Slimane of Harding, shirtless, smoking a cigarette.
Composition.
Harding calls his musical genre "slop 'n' soul", based on the leftovers of music he has encountered; the influence of many genres is evident. His voice – kept mellow throughout the album – ranges "from smoky croon to silky falsetto." Musically, "Soul Power" draws primarily from classic soul music. "Foot-stomping backbeats, brassy guitar-work, and booming horns" across the album are taken from 1960s soul.
In "Soul Power", examples of other genres include the indie rock guitar part of "I Don't Wanna Go Home"; the garage rock groove of "Drive My Car"; the disco style of "Heaven's on the Other Side". Classic rock and roll is featured in "Surf" (a song inspired by "The Walking Dead") and "I Don't Wanna Go Home" in contrast to the balladry of "Castaway". The lyrics of the somber, gospel-inspid song "Freedom" imply a connection with roots of soul music and slavery. "Keep on Shining" is shaped by a dynamic rhythm reminiscent of northern soul paired with brass flair and falsetto backing vocals.
Reception.
Harding was commended for his voice. "Harding's ability to keep every song in line with his personable singing and no-nonsense guitar is what makes this LP truly special – well, that and the fact that there’s not a bum track on it," wrote Michael Toland of "Blurt". "Harding is an undeniably versatile vocal talent, as you’d expect from someone schooled firstly in gospel choirs and then as a backing singer for CeeLo Green," wrote Tim Jonze of "The Guardian". "But ... it's hard to detect what he's bringing fresh to the mix. Too often, Harding's new blues and soul sound very much like the old versions."

Cäsar Horn

Cäsar Horn (18 May 1914 – 19 March 1945) was a German communist and resistance fighter against Nazism.
Biography.
Horn, a clerk, was born in Berlin. He joined both the Young Communist League of Germany (KJVD) and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1932. He was also active in the workers' sports club "Fichte". After the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, Horn joined the underground resistance and was active in the publication of an illegal newspaper, "Der Scheinwerfer".
In 1934, Horn joined the Reich Labour Service in order to provide a cover for his resistance activities. Despite this, his membership in the illegal workers' sports association Kampfgemeinschaft für Rote Sporteinheit was discovered in 1935. Horn was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment, which he served in Moabit Prison in Berlin and Börgermoor concentration camp in Emsland. After his release, Horn continued his resistance activities.
Horn was conscripted into the Wehrmacht in 1939. In 1943, he established contacts with the Saefkow-Jacob-Bästlein Organization, a resistance group. He was tasked with spreading anti-fascist messages amongst Wehrmacht soldiers, encouraging them to desert and join the anti-Nazi resistance instead.
On 19 July 1944, Horn was arrested, and on 23 January 1945 he was tried by the People's Court and sentenced to death. He was executed by guillotine on 19 March 1945 in Brandenburg-Görden Prison.

British naval missions to the Ottoman Empire

In the lead-up to World War I, there were three British naval missions to the Ottoman Empire, sent to help modernize and reform the Ottoman Navy. The missions were led by admirals Douglas Gamble (February 1909 – March 1910), Hugh Pigot Williams (April 1910 – April 1912), and Arthur Limpus (May 1912 – September 1914). Despite enjoying extensive formal authority, with the heads of the mission serving concurrently as Fleet Commanders of the Ottoman Navy, the success of the mission was limited due to political instability, pro-German tendencies within the leadership of the Young Turks, and the involvement of the Ottoman Empire in the Italo-Turkish War and the two Balkan Wars in 1911–1913, which led to naval defeats and the loss of several smaller units.

Amorfoda

"Amorfoda" is a song by Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny. It was released as a single by Rimas Entertainment on February 14, 2018. Bad Bunny co-wrote the song with Noah Assad, and its producers DJ Luian and Mambo Kingz. Eschewing Bad Bunny's Latin trap sound, "Amorfoda" is a piano ballad about regret in a relationship gone awry. The singer said it is about "something almost everyone has experienced. Everyone has been in love". Its title translates to "Fuck Love".
Background.
Bad Bunny wrote "Amorfoda" a long time before his rise to fame. In an interview for "Billboard", he said: "I've always loved this song because I wrote it with a lot of sentiment behind it. It's the kind of record that reminds me of the longevity of really good songs. A good song never gets old. It was just a matter of time, and it was time to come out with something different." The track's title arose when the singer was searching for a term in Portuguese to send love to the devil.

Facebook 3D Posts was a feature on the social networking website Facebook. It was first enabled on October 11, 2017 by introducing a new native 3D media type in Facebook News Feed. Initially the users could only post 3D objects from Oculus Medium and marker drawings from Spaces directly to Facebook as fully interactive 3D objects. The feature was available for desktops and mobile phones that support the underlying WebGL API.
On February 20, 2018 Facebook added support for the industry-standard glTF 2.0 file format for Facebook 3D posts. This allowed artists and creators to share 3D content on Facebook from a variety of sources. To make 3D Posts glTF 2.0 compliant, the support for textures, lighting, and physically based rendering techniques was implemented. 3D posts also supported unlit workflows for photogrammetry and stylized art.
Facebook has since disallowed users from sharing 3D objects.
Creating 3D Posts.
There were four ways to get a 3D asset to appear in a Facebook Post:
Tools for authoring content.
GLB files (binary form of glTF) were required to be loaded in Facebook 3D posts. These files could be obtained by converting from other files formats such as FBX or non-binary glTF. GLB files could also be directly exported from a variety of 3D editors, such as Blender, Vectary, Autodesk 3ds Max (using Verge3D exporter), Autodesk Maya, Modo, Microsoft Paint 3D, Substance Painter and others.

Alexandra Gardens Theatre

Alexandra Gardens Theatre was a theatre at Weymouth, Dorset, England. Originally known as the Alexandra Gardens Concert Hall, it was opened in 1924 and later converted into an amusement arcade in 1963. The building was destroyed by fire in 1993 and replaced with a new building which is still in use as the Electric Palace Amusement Arcade.
History.
The site of the theatre was originally reclaimed land used for grazing since the early 19th century. In 1869, the site was transformed and opened as New Gardens, and later renamed Alexandra Gardens in 1880. In 1913, the gardens' bandstand of 1891 was enclosed within a building of glass to form the Kursaal, allowing audiences to enjoy band performances in all weathers. During World War I, the Kursaal served as a reception centre for injured soldiers of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) who were accommodated in local camps following the Gallipoli Campaign. The Kursaal was later demolished and replaced by the Weymouth Corporation with the Alexandra Gardens Concert Hall, which was opened on 7 June 1924 by the Mayor of Weymouth. The gardens' bandstand was relocated to Nothe Gardens. The hall was requisitioned for military use during World War II and reopened again in 1945.
The hall, later renamed Alexandra Gardens Theatre, closed in 1963 and was taken over by Holland Leisure, who converted it into the Electric Palace Amusement Arcade. The building was destroyed by a fire in 1993 and replaced with a new family leisure and amusement centre by Holland Leisure. Planning permission was approved in November 1993, and the building was built to resemble the shape of the Kursaal.

Lama (geology)

Lama is a local toponym that denotes a wide furrow in the ground typical of the Murge landscape. Lamas convey rainwater from the Murge plateau to the endpoint of the drainage basin they belong to.
Lamas are generally confused with rivers or streams. There is a big difference between lamas and streams, since lamas collect only rainwater of their drainage basin, while they are completely dry when there is no rain. Moreover, in lamas water mostly flows underground and just a small amount of the rainwater flows on its surface. 
As for lamas, surface runoff is greatest in the extreme and uncommon situations of heavy rain. Lamas usually contain fertile soil, that deposited over the millennia due to the erosion and they are usually cultivated. Since they contain fertile soil, they are distinguishable from the nearby typical area of the Murge plateau, that is almost everywhere stony, arid and hard to grow. Lamas also occur in proximity of such notable dolines as Pulo di Altamura, Gurio Lamanna and Tre Paduli. Those lamas prove that the above dolines originated due to karst processes, that is the double action, both mechanical and chemical, of the rainwater conveyed by the lamas.
Characteristics.
Lamas are made up of alluvial soil deposited over the millennia and they are very fertile, in juxtaposition with the fractured limestone rocks typical of the Murge plateau. For this reason and for the rainwater frequently flowing through the beds of the lamas, they have been inhabited and cultivated since the Neolithic Age.
The existence of lamas is due to the karst processes of Apulia region and Murge. The fractured limestone rocks turn out to be highly permeable to rainwater (limestone itself is not particularly permeable, but if heavily fractured, it becomes extremely permeable).
The high permeability of the whole region is responsible for the low surface runoff and the higher amount of water flowing underground. Inside lamas, rainwater also flows on its surface, but in a smaller amount. Rainwater flowing underground follows almost the same path as the lama's. This is due to the capillary fringe (Water table).

Sir William Cook, 2nd Baronet

Sir William Cook, 2nd Baronet (c. 1630 - January 1708, of Broome Hall, Norfolk was a member of the East Anglian gentry and Tory Member of Parliament.
Life.
He was the eldest son of William Cook (died 1681), whose father had acquired Broome Hall by marriage in 1603. The 1st Baronet remained neutral in the English Civil War, though he did sign the Norfolk address to George Monck for a free parliament in 1660 and was made a baronet three years later. The 2nd Baronet's mother was the 1st Baronet's first wife, Mary Astley, daughter of Thomas Astley of Melton Constable. He attended Emmanuel College, Cambridge from 1647 and Gray's Inn from 1648 and was noted as "very well versed in every kind of learning, but especially distinguished by the suavity of his manners".
He was a Justice of the Peace for Norfolk from 1660 to 1668 and a captain in the militia from around October 1660 to 1679 or possibly later. He became a commissioner for assessment Norfolk in 1661 and for Suffolk in 1679, holding both posts until 1680. His marriage settlement dates to 1664 - he married Jane Steward (died 1698), daughter of William Steward of Barton Mills. They had seven daughters. In 1675 he was made commissioner for recusants in Norfolk. He had become deputy lieutenant of Norfolk by 1676 and in 1681 he succeeded to his father's baronetcy.
The 1677 session of parliament began to show fracture lines between Charles II's court and Parliament. Cook supported Robert Paston in backing the former, making him a potential pro-Crown candidate in the 1679 and 1681 elections. Cook did finally stand for Great Yarmouth in 1685 and won one of its two seats - in the same year he was made a freeman of Great Yarmouth. However, soon afterwards he wrote to William Sancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury:
He was appointed to nine minor committees during James II's single Parliament - he was the first man appointed to the committee for the bill for the renewal of the Yarmouth Harbour Act, meaning it was probably he who had introduced it. In 1688 he agreed that some of the laws penalising Roman Catholics and non-conformists might "require a review and amendment" but refused to agree to the abolition of the Test Acts. He was thus removed from his deputy lieutenancy and all other local office in February 1688 and in October that year refused to sit on the bench alongside Roman Catholics. In the post-Glorious Revolution elections of 1689 he was returned for Norfolk and also sat for the county in 1690 and 1698.
When the House of Commons had to vote on the House of Lords' motion that the throne was not vacant (due to its being occupied by William III and Mary II), Cook voted in agreement. After brief sick leave early in 1690, he returned to Westminster and sat on twenty committees in the Convention Parliament, including ones to repeal the Corporation Act 1661, to inquire into the fall in rents, to adopt new oaths of supremacy and allegiance and to consider abolishing the hearth tax. He also helped consider a bill for bringing in tithes more efficiently and later committees to inquire into disasters during the war and to limit spending in elections. He had to sell Broome Hall and is buried at Cranworth, where his epitaph maintains him as a defender of monarchy "equally unaffected by the wicked artifices of rabid Papists and schismatics". In the absence of any sons or relations, the baronetcy went extinct on his death.

Naver Papago

Naver Papago (Hangul: 네이버 파파고), shortened to Papago and stylized as papago, is a multilingual machine translation cloud service provided by Naver Corporation. Unlike other translators, Papago uses a neural machine to learn from its mistakes and learn what type of translations the user requires. The word "Papago" comes from the Esperanto word for "parrot", Esperanto being a constructed language.
Features.
Papago exited its trial phase and officially launched on July 19, 2017 with translation options for Korean, Japanese, Chinese, English, Spanish, and French. It was only available as a smartphone app but it has since launched its own website and has expanded to other languages.
From November 2019, Papago was changed to be available without Internet service. 
In 2020, the image translation function was introduced, and text in photos can be translated directly. It supports a total of six languages, including Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai.
Special function.
WSD screen.
If a homonym is detected in a sentence to be translated, the corresponding word is underlined in the Translation Results tab via the Word Sense Disposition (WSD) function. Click on the word to display a picture that expresses various meanings in simple shapes, and by choosing the correct shapes, you can get more accurate and correct translation results. This function seems to be able to solve the chronic problem in machine translation, the processing of Chinese words, but there are many cases where the data are not underlined due to the lack of them.
Automatic conversion of exchange rate.
Using real-time exchange rate information, the current exchange rate is calculated along with the translation result.
Global conversation.
It can be used even when it is not connected to the network. All four languages are available, and you can see the original text and how to read the frequently used essential phrases depending on the situation.
Push-to-talk.
This technology allows voice recognition even in noisy environments.
Supported languages.
The following languages are supported in Naver Papago.

In this department he carried out the duties of Head of the department subdivision of Indre from 1989 to 1996 and Head of the department subdivision of Loir et Cher from 1996 to 1999. These local responsibilities enabled him to manage teams offering a wide range of skills and expertise, covering in particular areas of intervention, such as local authority aid and subsidies (at state, regional and European Commission level) aimed at investing in and reinforcing the management of SME-SMIs and intermediate-sized enterprises, protection of the industrial environment (legislation governing classified facilities and water in particular), mines and quarries and the promotion of ICT in SMEs, SMIs and intermediate-sized enterprises.

Time &amp; Space

Time &amp; Space is the second studio album and major label debut by the American punk rock band Turnstile, released on 23 February 2018 through Roadrunner, being their debut on the label. It was produced by veteran producer Will Yip.
The album was met with critical acclaim by contemporary music critics upon release. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard Heatseekers chart and number fifteen on the Top Hard Rock Albums chart.
Background.
After the release of their debut album in 2015 the band signed to Roadrunner Records to record and release their second album. Speaking to "Noisey", lead vocalist Brendan Yates spoke on the bands decision to sign to a major label "It’s been super cool. The coolest part about it, and the thing that makes me feel good about being in a band, is that the process was really natural. They expressed interest in putting out our last LP. I think we met them in 2014 but, at that point, it didn’t feel natural." going on to say "Obviously, we’ve grown up on some Roadrunner records, and we’ve known what the label is based off records that have been inspiring to us, like Madball, Biohazard, and Life of Agony".
Recording.
The album was recorded in 2017/18 with producer Will Yip at his Studio 4 recording facility in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. Speaking to SPIN in early 2018 about the album Brendan Yates spoke about the bands vision for the album; "It’s just the idea of disconnecting oneself from situations and letting go, separating yourself," going on to say "It’s just a lot of reflection, in that sense: stepping back and looking at the position you’re in, the relationships you’re in…[it’s about] getting outside of your mind—and out of your body—to see the clearing."
Release.
The album was released worldwide on 23 February 2018 through Roadrunner Records on CD, 12" vinyl and through online services. In the US the record peaked at number one on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart, number four on the US Vinyl Albums chart and fifteen on the Top Hard Rock Albums. In Europe the album charted on the UK Rock and Metal Albums chart at number twelve and number eight nine on the German Albums chart.
Critical reception.
The album was met with critical acclaim upon release, with the album currently holding an aggregated score of 81 on Metacritic based on 12 reviews. Writing for The New York Times Jon Caramanica praised the album: "Time &amp; Space” is its outstanding second album, just over 25 minutes long, and an urgent, clear and bruising statement of purpose", adding "this album also has moments of lightness, mild turns in complementary directions that add breathing room and complexity".
Giving the album 4 stars, Will Richards writing for DIY proclaimed "Turnstile have made a name as one of the most exciting hardcore bands on the planet. Second offering ‘Time &amp; Space’ hammers the point home, and is a huge hammer-blow". Concluding the article: "Sneaking under the half-hour mark, ‘Time &amp; Space’ is a comprehensive thrash that places Turnstile as the most inventive, forward-thinking band in hardcore".
Drowned in Sound gave the album 7/10 with reviewer Adam Turner-Heffer calling the record "easily the most impressive sounding record of their relatively short careers so far, without taking the energy away from their raw power." he did however have a few criticisms ; "If there is a major criticism to be lobbed at Time &amp; Space however, is that its one-noted nature will make it difficult for anyone outside of genre fans to want to reach out over and encourage a crossover appeal".
Pitchfork gave the album a mixed review, summarizing reviewer Sam Lefebvre wrote "The “experimentation” on the Baltimore band's latest album is hesitant and unfocused. It's a punishingly familiar collision of yesteryear's crossover rock with textbook hardcore bluster". The Guardian also gave the album a mixed review, with Dave Simpson commenting on the short length of certain album tracks; "Former Lauryn Hill backing singer Tanikka Charraé turns up on Bomb’s funky hip-hop interlude, but again it’s over in seconds, and one wonders what they could have achieved by being even bolder."
Kerrang! magazine praised the album highly on release, awarding it their full 5-K rating, and later named it the best album of 2018 in their year-end list.

Witton-le-Wear railway station

Witton-le-Wear railway station is a railway station on the Weardale heritage railway serves the village of Witton-le-Wear in County Durham, North East England, and is the penultimate stop for most of line's eastbound passenger services (though one return service from train per day currently terminates here rather than continuing to the eastern terminus at ). The current station platform is located on the opposite side of the track to the original railway station which was operation between 1847 and 1953.
History.
The first station opened on 3 April 1847 by the Wear Valley Company on their line from the Bishop Auckland &amp; Weardale Railway at Witton Junction to and was located close to the A68. This line was extended to in 1862 by the Frosterley &amp; Stanhope Railway. It was found that this station's location on a curved and steeply graded section of the line made it difficult to start passenger trains from it and thus, in the 1880s, the North Eastern Railway constructed a new station 20 chains to the east, on the east side of Witton-le-Wear level crossing. On 21 October 1895, the Stanhope line was extended once again to reach .
Opposite the second station was a single road goods shed and a coal drop while on the west side of the level crossing was another siding serving a horse and cattle dock. The station was closed to passengers on 27 June 1953 and to goods traffic on 1 November 1965.
The station was closed to passengers by British Railways (BR) on 29 June 1953 and goods on 1 November 1965. In 1961 the line was cut back to and then, in 1968, it was further reduced to the Blue Circle Cement Works (later owned by Lafarge), just to the west of . Though stopping goods trains had been withdrawn, the line was retained to serve the cement works ad, in 1988 BR introduced a summer Sunday extension to the regular to 'Heritage Line' service to Stanhope though no stop was provided at Witton-le-Wear (the second station had been demolished in April 1973) and the service was subsequently withdrawn after the summer of 1992. The remaining freight was withdrawn on 17 March 1993.
Weardale Railway.
Rather than close the line when freight traffic was withdrawn, the line was mothballed and a campaign began in 1993 to preserve the line as a heritage railway. Weardale Railways Limited purchased the line in 2004 and reopened it between and Stanhope in July 2004. However the organisation struggled financially and the service was suspended a short time later, not recommencing until August 2006.
After major efforts to clear the line of vegetation and repair damaged tracks, passenger services along the section between Stanhope and through Witton-le-Wear were reintroduced 23 May 2010. In early August 2012, the Weardale Railway announced that a new £25,000 station was under construction (using elements from the first temporary platform at Bishop Auckland West station) as a result of a joint initiative with Witton-le-Wear Parish Council, the Witton Castle Country Park and Durham County Council. However, by the time the station was ready for use, the 2012 season had ended and, in 2013, it was announced that regular passenger services had been discontinued.
In June 2014 a limited, volunteer-run passenger service was reintroduced between Stanhope and Wolsingham using a class 122 "Bubble Car" and on 27 March 2016 this service was extended to Witton-le-Wear, nearly four years after the station had been constructed. In April 2018, the Weardale Railway CIC announced that works had commenced to lift a short section of track at Broken Banks (approximately 1/2 mile west of Bishop Auckland station) to enable the embankment to be repaired after subsidence had made the line unusable for passenger traffic. Once the works are complete it is intended to reinstate the tracks and extend the Stanhope to Witton-le-Wear passenger service back to Bishop Auckland West station. Since July 2018, two of the three daily return services between Stanhope and Witton-le-Wear have continued to Bishop Auckland West station.

Janine Wissler

Janine Wissler (natively spelled Wißler; born 23 May 1981) is a German politician who has been co-chairwoman of The Left since 2021. Prior, she served as member of the Landtag of Hesse since 2008 and leader of the state parliamentary group since 2009, including as sole leader since 2014, as well as deputy leader of the federal party since 2014. She is one of The Left's lead candidates for the 2021 German federal election, alongside Dietmar Bartsch.
Education and personal life.
Wissler attended the Dreieich Wingert School from 1987 to 1991 and the Dreieich Ricarda High School from 1991 to 2001. She then completed a degree in political science from 2001 to 2012 at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt. In addition to her studies, she worked as a part-time specialist saleswoman in a hardware store from 2002 to 2007. From 2005 to 2008 she also worked in the constituency office of Bundestag deputy Werner Dreibus.
Political career.
Wissler co-founded the Hessian branch of Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative (WASG) in 2004, and joined The Left when WASG merged into it in 2007. At its founding congress, Wissler was elected as one of the 44 members of the party executive committee. In the 2008 Hessian state election, she was one of six Left party deputies elected. She retained her seat in the 2009, 2013, and 2018 elections. She was deputy leader of the parliamentary group from 2008 to 2009, then became co-leader of the group alongside Willi van Ooyen in February 2009.
In 2011, Wissler became leader of the Left party's local branch in the Hessian capital of Frankfurt am Main. She ran for mayor of Frankfurt am Main in the 2012 and 2018 elections. In 2012, she placed fifth with 3.8% of the vote; in 2018, she placed fourth with 8.8%.
After Willi van Ooyen's resignation in 2014, Wissler became the sole parliamentary leader of her party in the Hessian Landtag.
Wissler is a member of attac and the trade union ver.di. Until 2020, she was a member of the Trotskyist group Marx21 and the Socialist Left, a socialist faction within The Left. Both are monitored by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution as potential extremist groups.
In the 2018 Hessian state election, Wissler was one of the party's lead candidates alongside Jan Schalauske. The party won 6.3%, its best result to date, and increased its parliamentary presence from six to nine members.
At the 2014 Left party congress, Wissler was elected one of six federal deputy leaders. She received the highest proportion of votes of any candidate.
In January 2020, Wissler was among several politicians who received death threats from "NSU 2.0", a purported successor of neo-Nazi terrorist group the National Socialist Underground (NSU). The threats included confidential information taken from Frankfurt police computers. She was subject to further threats in July 2020. An investigation into a potential far-right extremist network operating within the Hessian police was subsequently launched by the state government.
In September 2020, Wissler announced her candidacy for the federal co-leadership of The Left. Prior to submitting her application, she resigned from Marx21 and the Socialist Left, stating it was customary for candidates to terminate their association with internal factions. Wissler was elected federal co-chairwoman at a party conference on 27 February 2021, winning 84.2% of votes cast.
On 2 May 2021, Wissler was announced as one of The Left's lead candidates for the upcoming federal election, alongside Dietmar Bartsch. She and Bartsch were confirmed with 87% of votes by the party executive on 9 May.
Political positions.
Wissler is considered a member of her party's left wing. She rejects capitalism as an "inhuman, cruel system". She has stated that a classless society cannot be achieved through parliaments or governments, and that historical progress has always been achieved through revolution.
Wissler advocates the Germany's withdrawal from NATO and the alliance's dissolution. She opposes all military missions abroad, even under a United Nations mandate, stating: "There are no 'humanitarian interventions'. Wars are never fought out of charity, but out of economic and political interests." She supports raising taxes on the rich to provide greater funding for public services. When asked what she believed the world would look like in fifty years, she stated "I wish for a world in which the pursuit of profit does not come first and in which all people can live in peace and social security. If the enormous wealth that exists in the world were distributed fairly, no one would have to live in poverty. But to do that, you have to fundamentally change the balance of power and ownership."
In 2020, she stated that her party must stand up for justice, ecology, and peace at home and abroad, acting as a force that "supports concrete struggles and represents an anti-capitalist perspective".
Assessment.
Wissler was aged 26 upon her election to the Landtag, and quickly attracted a high profile for her rapid advancement at a young age, as well as her controversial positions. She was portrayed as a contrast to then-Minister-President of Hesse Roland Koch, a noted conservative from the right-wing of the CDU. At this time, Oskar Lafontaine recognised her as a great political talent.
Wissler is considered a pragmatic and effective parliamentarian. She was a key figure in the unsuccessful attempt to form a red-red-green government in Hesse after the 2008 election. As co-leader of her party's parliamentary group in Hesse, she was described as reliable and conciliatory, able to work constructively across party lines; FAZ reported that deputies from other parties preferred to work with her than her counterpart van Ooyen. The publication described Wissler's speeches as among the most pointed of any deputy, and that "she uses all the instruments that parliament has to offer with great virtuosity". Within her party, she is well-connected in both the western and eastern states.
Controversy.
Wissler's high profile and radical positions have attracted criticism. The Hessian CDU described her statements about parliamentarism and revolution as "particularly worrying" and evidence of the "partially anti-constitutional" nature of her party, claiming they represent its "turning away from parliamentary democracy". Her election as co-Landtag leader was received with some controversy within her own party due to her association with Marx21 (formerly Linksruck), which is recognised by the "Bundesverfassungsschutz" as an extremist group.
Wissler was accused of "falsifying history" by members of the Social Democratic Party after claiming that Social Democrats were responsible for the murder of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht.
At demonstrations against the opening of the Seat of the European Central Bank on 18 March 2015, she worked as a parliamentary observer and accompanied the Italian "rainbow" group. According to the police, this group was responsible for riots in the city centre. Wissler subsequently condemned such behaviour, stating: "That is definitely not what it should be about. We wanted a peaceful protest against the ECB."

Streamlined Ocean Liner

The Streamlined Ocean Liner was a design by Norman Bel Geddes for a streamlined steam-powered ocean liner. The shape was compared by Pathé to that of a porpoise, blunt at the front and tapered at the rear. It first appeared in Geddes' 1932 book "Horizons" and an outline patent was filed in 1933 with a detailed patent following in 1934. An offer was made for the rights to the design in the late 1930s, which Geddes refused, as he still hoped to sell it to an American shipbuilder, but the ship was never built.
Background.
Norman Bel Geddes was one of the first industrial designers in the United States. He was one of the pioneers of streamlining in design, producing ambitious and futuristic projects in the 1930s for vehicles, flying cars, aircraft, and consumer goods, only some of which were realized.
Design.
The liner was designed by Norman Bel Geddes and his staff as an "office exercise", an ambitious or unusual project of the type that Geddes was in the habit of giving to his staff in the gaps between client commissions. It would have been long with a displacement of 70,000 tons and accommodated 2,000 first-class passengers and 900 crew. Its streamlined form was intended to reduce the effect of wind resistance and improve speed by an estimated 14 percent. The streamlining was created by the cigar shape of the ship, which hid the oval smoke stacks inside the superstructure along with all the other external features of the ship such as lifeboats, walkways, and sundecks. Behind the rear smoke stack were two small aircraft that would normally be hidden. In good weather, parts of the outer skin, which was part transparent, could be slid back to expose recreation areas or, in the event of an emergency, launch the 24 lifeboats. 
The only protruding part of the design was the navigator's bridge which was swept back like a monoplane wing in order to reduce wind resistance.
The design first appeared in Geddes' 1932 book "Horizons", and in exterior form only in a 1933 patent simply described as "boat" without interior plans or a detailed accompanying text. Geddes also filed a patent in 1933 relating to boat-launching and stowing gear. In 1934 he filed a more detailed patent referring to the earlier two and giving three dense pages of explanatory text.
Also featured in "Horizons" was a 1932 design for a giant aircraft known as Airliner Number 4 that Geddes saw as a replacement for the ocean liner and which he hoped would cut the travel time from America to England to 42 hours from the four and a half days taken by an ocean liner.
Reception and legacy.
In April 1934, the liner was shown on the front cover of "Popular Science Monthly" with a full page feature inside, in which it was described as one of the "Ocean Greyhounds". "Popular Mechanics" used the same phrase in 1935, additionally suggesting that the idea of the streamlined ship had been modeled on the air clipper, describing it as "like a great airliner with its flying bridge".
In 1935, the liner featured in a Pathé newsreel titled "The Liner Of Tomorrow!" in which the narrator explained streamlining and compared the shape of the ship to that of a porpoise, blunt at the front and tapered at the back, saying: "nature evolved this form a long time ago". "Encyclopædia Britannica" pictured the liner in a supplement titled "Machine-Made Art" (1935), while "The New York Sun" described it as "a vessel so far removed, yet not without its own beauty of line that our work-a-day brain reels before it".
Despite Geddes' patents, vessels began to appear with a similarity to his such as Raymond Loewy's for the Virginia Ferry Company (1933) and the redesigned (launched 1935) with its aircraft styling.
In the late 1930s, theatrical designer Ernest de Weerth visited Geddes on behalf of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and offered to buy all the blueprints, sketches, and rights to the ship for $200,000. Geddes declined, as he still expected to sell the idea to American shipbuilders.
In 2015, cultural commentator Bernhard Siegert commented, "One can see that it is a manmade machine, yet it nonetheless has taken on the appearance of a thing shaped by wind and water, like a smoothly polished bone. Is it suppose to move on, above, or under water?"
Papers relating to the project are held in the Norman Bel Geddes Collection at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.

Sir Thomas Hare, 2nd Baronet

Sir Thomas Hare, 2nd Baronet (c. 1658 - 1 January 1693) was a member of the East Anglian gentry and a Member of the Parliament of England.
Life.
He was the eldest son of Sir Ralph Hare, 1st Baronet (died 1672) by his first wife - her name is unknown. He attended Caius College, Cambridge from 1672, the year in which he also succeeded his father in the baronetcy. His guardian was Sir Horatio Townshend, but his tutor at Cambridge was Dr Robert Brady. He headed his tenants at the county election in February 1679 but was still too young to replace Sir Christopher Calthorpe as MP for Norfolk in 1679. On 20 April 1680 he married Elizabeth Dashwood, daughter of a merchant from Hackney named George Dashwood - they had four sons and five daughters. One of the younger sons, Thomas, was a Tory MP for Truro from 1713 to 1715.
Also in 1680 he became a justice of the peace, followed by deputy lieutenant of Norfolk in 1683. Robert Paston nominated him as a pro-Charles II candidate for Norfolk in 1681, but he lost the election, only to win in 1685. In 1682 he became a freeman of King's Lynn and was one of the Norfolk signatories to the loyal address critiquing the Association. On questioning by the Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk he refused to support repealing the Penal Laws and Test Acts against Roman Catholics. This led to his removal from his deputy lieutenancy and his post as JP in February 1688 and in October that year he was offered a return to the bench but refused, since he would have to sit on the bench with Roman Catholics. After the Glorious Revolution he seems to have become a non-juror. He was only 35 at his death and was buried in Stow Bardolph. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir Ralph Hare, who became the 3rd Baronet.

Memories of the Alhambra

Memories of the Alhambra () is a 2018 South Korean television series, starring Hyun Bin and Park Shin-hye. Primarily set in Spain (and in South Korea in latter episodes), the series centers on a company CEO and a hostel owner who get entangled in a series of mysterious incidents surrounding a new and intricate augmented reality game inspired by the stories of the Alhambra Palace. It aired on cable network tvN from December 1, 2018, to January 20, 2019, every Saturday and Sunday at 21:00 (KST). It is also available for online streaming on Netflix.
The drama is one of the highest-rated Korean dramas in cable television history, and was praised for its creative plot and its unexpected twists. Its title also alludes to Francisco Tárrega's eponymous classical guitar piece "Recuerdos de la Alhambra", which is also a part of the series' soundtrack.
Synopsis.
After receiving an email regarding a groundbreaking AR game about medieval battles in the Alhambra, Yoo Jin-woo (Hyun Bin), CEO of an investment company that specializes in optical devices, travels to Granada, Spain to meet the creator of the game, Jung Se-joo (Park Chan-yeol). However, Se-joo has gone missing and there, he meets his older sister, Jung Hee-joo (Park Shin-hye), who is the owner of the hostel he stays in and a former guitarist. Both get entangled in mysterious incidents, as the border between the real world and the AR world built by Se-joo begins to blur.
Production.
The series is helmed by director Ahn Gil-ho, who directed "Stranger" and writer Song Jae-jung whose previous works include "W" and "Queen In-hyun's Man".
Touted as Korea's first augmented reality-gaming drama, "Memories of the Alhambra" was revealed to be inspired by tech mogul Elon Musk and the "Pokémon Go" game.
The first script reading took place in May 2018.
Overseas filming took place in several cities in Andalucía and Catalonia, such as Granada (Andalucía), and Barcelona and Girona (some interiors and exteriors) and Terrassa (exteriors and film studios) in Catalonia from late May to June. In early August, the cast started filming in Budapest, Hungary and Slovenia. The script for the last episode was completed on December 19, 2018 and filming wrapped up on December 29, 2018 in South Korea.
A preview screening event was held at CGV theaters on November 28, 2018 prior to the airing of the first episode.
Reception.
"Memories of the Alhambra" was a commercial success, consistently topping the cable television viewership ratings in its timeslot. Its 14th episode recorded a 10.025% nationwide audience share according to Nielsen paid platform, making it as one of the highest rated in Korean cable television history.
The drama has attracted attention for its unique theme of augmented reality; and earned praise for its high-end computer graphics, cinematography and fast-paced storytelling. Critic Jeong Seok-hee praised the drama for its mysterious and captivating plot that held viewers' attention until the very end, and that it "has the potential to become one of the very best TV dramas we have seen in years". However, later on it received criticism for its confusing development and slow development of plot, and its excessive product placement.
According to the Korean Foundation for International Cultural Exchange, the series is receiving favorable reviews and popularity in China for its actors' performance, cinematography and fresh story.

Caroline Spencer, Duchess of Marlborough

Caroline Spencer, Duchess of Marlborough (13 January 1743 – 26 November 1811), formerly Lady Caroline Russell, was the wife of George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough.
Early life.
Lady Caroline was born on 13 January 1743. She was the daughter of John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, and his second wife, the former Gertrude Leveson-Gower. Her father served as the British Ambassador to France and Lord President of the Council. Her brother was Francis Russell, Marquess of Tavistock (the father of her nephews Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford, and John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford).
Her paternal grandparents were Wriothesley Russell, 2nd Duke of Bedford and the former Elizabeth Howland (the daughter and heiress of John Howland of Streatham, Surrey). Her maternal grandparents were John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower and the former Lady Evelyn Pierrepont (a daughter of Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull).
Personal life.
On 23 August 1762, Lady Caroline was married to George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough at Bedford House in Bloomsbury, London. George was a son of Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough and the former the Hon. Elizabeth Trevor (daughter of Thomas Trevor, 2nd Baron Trevor). Together, they were the parents of:
The Duchess died at Blenheim Palace on 26 November 1811. The Duke died on 29 January 1817.
Legacy.
A letter survives from Caroline to Ozias Humphrey, which has been approximately dated to 1788. In it, she refers to a portrait drawing of her husband by Thomas Gainsborough. Gainsborough having died in 1788, she asks Humphrey to complete the painted portrait. Caroline and her husband were also painted together by William Austin. Her own portrait, as a child, had been painted by Jean-Étienne Liotard around 1754. She was also painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds around the time of her marriage, and later, with her eldest daughter.
Queen Charlotte, consort of King George III, is reputed to have called Caroline "the proudest woman in England". She died on 26 November 1811 and was buried at Blenheim Palace.

Alfred Kästner

Alfred Kästner (12 December 1882 – 12 April 1945) was a German communist and resistance fighter against Nazism.
Biography.
Kästner was born in Leipzig. He was a wood merchant by profession, and a member of the Spartacus League. In November 1918, during the German Revolution, he was elected to the Leipzig Workers' and Soldiers' Council. Kästner was also a founding member of the Leipzig branch of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1919. When the KPD was banned in 1923–1924, underground meetings were held in Kästner's office.
After the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, Kästner's office was once again used for underground gatherings of KPD activists from Leipzig as well as nearby towns such as Chemnitz, Dresden and Riesa, and for printing illegal pamphlets.
Kästner was arrested in September 1933; although he was sentenced to two years and eight months' imprisonment, he was interned in the concentration camps Sachsenburg, Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald until 1939.
After his release, Kästner joined the resistance group around Georg Schumann and maintained contact with resistance fighters in Hamburg, Bavaria and Württemberg.
Kästner was arrested again by the Gestapo on 11 March 1945. He was shot to death by the SS in , northwest of Leipzig, and thrown in a pit together with 52 other German and foreign anti-fascists on 12 April 1945, just a week before the U.S. Army entered Leipzig.
The street in the Südvorstadt borough of Leipzig where Alfred Kästner lived was renamed Alfred-Kästner-Straße on 1 August 1945.

Road barrier effect

The barrier effect of roads and highways is a phenomenon usually associated with landscape ecology, referring to the barrier that linear infrastructure like roads c
or railways place on the movement of animals. Largely viewed as a negative process, the barrier effect has also been found to have several positive effects, particularly with smaller species. To reduce a road or railway's barrier effect, wildlife crossings are regarded as one of the best mitigation options, ideally in combination with wildlife fencing. The barrier effect is closely linked to habitat fragmentation and road ecology. 
Effects on wildlife.
Negative effects.
Roads.
Both existing roads and the construction of new highways act as barriers for many species, fragmenting the surrounding habitat to such a degree that connectivity, or the ability for an animal to travel to all areas of its home range, is made practically impossible. Generally, animals with a higher vagility, or ability to travel long distances, are more severely impacted by roads compared to species with smaller home ranges.
Railways.
While very few studies have analyzed the effect of railways on animal movement, their presence across landscapes in most areas of the world suggests that they likely pose a significant barrier for many species. Most studies relating to this sub-field focus on animal use of drainage culverts underneath railway networks. For example, Rodriguez et al. (1996) found that nearly 80% of culverts in their study received visits by both mammals and reptiles.
Land-use types.
Although few studies have analyzed the effect of land type on animal movement, those that exist have found man-made clearings and agricultural land to be strong barriers for many species who may only travel within forested landscapes.
Positive effects.
12% of studies analyzing the effects of roads on animals have found positive effects, indicating that some species benefit from the presence of roads. The predation release hypothesis, suggesting that roads may indirectly cause increases in abundances of animals whose predators are negatively affected by road, is often attributed to most positive effects of roads on animals. 
Mitigation measures.
Driver behavior.
Studies have found that reducing the speed at which drivers travel along the road produces less noise, potentially reducing the road's barrier effect. The reduction in noise coming from the highway is assumed to make the road surface less intimidating for animals, potentially allowing crossings to take place. This increase in crossings, however, may result in a subsequent increase in animal-vehicle collisions.
Animal movement.
Wildlife crossings, such as wildlife overpasses or underpasses, are generally seen as the most effective mitigation measure to help make roads more passable for wildlife while increasing both driver and animal safety. To funnel wildlife towards these crossings, many studies have called for a combination of both wildlife crossings and exclusion fencing, making the crossings under or over the road the only available path for wildlife. With a combination of both wildlife crossings and suitable lengths of fencing, the barrier effect of roads is expected to decrease, allowing animals to access both sides of the road and therefore allowing for important life cycle processes including migration and mating.

Gemma Hickey

Gemma Hickey is a Canadian LGBTQ2 rights activist and author. They became one of the first Canadians to receive a gender-neutral birth certificate and passport. Hickey founded The Pathways Foundation, an organization that offers support to survivors of religious institutional abuse and their families. Since 2010, Hickey has worked as Executive Director of Artforce, formerly known as For the Love of Learning, a non-profit that works to forge new paths for at-risk youth by advancing their literacy and creative skills.
Background.
Gemma Hickey was born in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, on October 1, 1976. They attended Gonzaga High School, graduating in 1994. In 2003, Hickey graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies from Memorial University of Newfoundland. During their time at post-secondary, they served as General Director of LBGT-MUN (now Sexual and Gender Advocacy).
Hickey was raised Roman Catholic but left the Catholic Church in 2003 to become a member of the Wesley United Church of Canada congregation.
Hickey is non-binary, and uses the pronouns "they" and "them". Hickey's transition is the subject of the 2017 documentary film "Just Be Gemma", which aired on CBC Television and the Documentary Channel, as well as being screened at the Nickel Film Festival in St. John's, the Atlantic Film Festival in Halifax, and at the Canadian Embassy in Tokyo, Japan.
Gemma Hickey's first book, "Almost Feral", a memoir chronicling their walk across Newfoundland and the emotional terrain travelled within was published in October 2019 by Breakwater Books. In 2020, the book won two awards at the Atlantic Book Awards: the APMA Best Atlantic Published Book Award, and the Margaret and John Savage First Book Award in the non-fiction category. Hickey was also one of 24 Canadian writers to be featured on CBC Books’ Writers to Watch list, and CBC Books also named "Almost Feral" as one of 40 Canadian books on the summer 2020 reading list.
Activism.
Gemma Hickey has spent years campaigning for LGBTQ2 rights in Canada, through their involvement in Egale Canada, PFLAG Canada, and Canadians for Equal Marriage. In 2003, Hickey traveled to Halifax to present a brief on same-sex marriage to the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. Hickey was president of Egale Canada in 2005, when same-sex marriage in Canada was legalized.
Hickey is outspoken about the trauma of sexual abuse by clergy. After going public about being sexually abused at the hands of a Roman Catholic priest, Hickey founded The Pathways Foundation in 2013, a non-profit organization that helps people deal with the effects of such abuse. Hickey continues to raise the issue publicly, including attending the February 2019 Vatican sexual abuse summit in Rome.
On June 2, 2015, a private member's bill was tabled in the House of Commons in Ottawa that Hickey had helped draft, to make June 1 the National Institutional Abuse Awareness Day.
In 2015, Hickey undertook a 908-kilometer walk across the island of Newfoundland to raise awareness and funds for survivors of clergy abuse. Hickey completed the month-long walk at the Mount Cashel Orphanage Memorial in St. John's, the site of the largest sexual abuse scandal in Canadian history.
Non-binary official documents.
Canada introduced non-binary passports in August 2017, becoming the first country in the Americas to allow its citizens to use 'X' in the gender category. Hickey applied and received one of the first issued, and used the passport to travel to Germany and visit a memorial to gay people persecuted by the Nazis. Hickey then traveled to Japan to speak about LGBTQ2 issues, to attend a screening of their documentary film "Just Be Gemma", and to give a reading from their memoir, "Almost Feral".
On December 14, 2017, Hickey became the first person in Newfoundland and Labrador, and one of the first in Canada, to receive a non-binary birth certificate. Their application was initially rejected because the Vital Statistics Act limited gender designation on the application form to male and female only. In response to the rejection, Hickey filed an application at the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador to challenge the constitutionality of the law. The province changed the legislation before the court proceedings concluded. The space for 'gender' on Hickey's birth certificate is marked with 'X' instead of a 'M' or 'F'.
Politics.
Hickey ran for a seat in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly in the riding of Kilbride in a by-election called for February 8, 2007 following the resignation of Ed Byrne. They again sought election to the provincial House of Assembly, this time in the Electoral District of St. John's East, in a general election held October 9, 2007.
In January 2021, Hickey was confirmed as the Liberal candidate in St. John's Centre for the 2021 provincial election. Hickey was defeated by incumbent NDP MHA Jim Dinn.
Honours and awards.
In 2012, Hickey was recognized with a Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal for their contribution to LBGTQ2 rights in Canada.
In 2016, Hickey was named a Newfoundland and Labrador Human Rights Champion for their longstanding commitment to human rights protection, particularly for LGBTQ2 people.

Sir Peter Gleane, 1st Baronet

Sir Peter Gleane, 1st Baronet (c. 1619 - 7 February 1696) was a member of the East Anglian gentry and Member of the Parliament of England.
Life.
He was baptised in 1619, the eldest son of Thomas Gleane (died 1661) and Elizabeth Brewse. His father was descended from major merchants in Norwich during the Tudor era - Thomas' grandfather had bought Hardwick in Norfolk as his family seat and his father Peter had sat for Norwich between 1628 and 1629.
Thomas remained neutral in the Civil War, but Peter raised two foot companies for the Royalists at his own expense during the English Civil War and served in the regiment of Sir Thomas Bridges of Somerset - he is recorded as a Lieutenant of Foot around 1643, possibly rising to Captain by 1645. During the Protectorate he continued to be suspected of Royalist sympathies and around 1650 he married Penelope Rodney (died 1690), daughter of Sir Edward Rodney of Rodney Stoke - the couple had two sons and one daughter. On the English Restoration in 1660 he became a major in the militia and a lieutenant in the volunteer horse, whilst the following year he succeeded his father and the following year he became a commissioner for "loyal and indigent officers".
A baronetcy was created for him on 6 March 1666 during the 2nd Anglo-Dutch War, in which he served as Lieutenant Colonel of Lord Townshend's Regiment of Foot. He was Townshend's second in command and led the defence of Great Yarmouth. He became a commissioner for recusants in 1675 but he and Townshend were both removed from local office in 1676. During the Exclusion Crisis he actively favoured barring James, Duke of York from the succession for his Roman Catholicism. He then stood with Sir John Hobart for Norfolk in autumn 1679, gaining dissenters' support and beating the two pro-Charles II candidates. In his victory speech to the freeholders Gleane promised that: 
He was appointed to five committees during the Second Exclusion Parliament and was re-elected in 1681. This second election finally broke his finances, however, and in 1682 he erected his own tomb in the chancel of the church at Hardwick, though he was never buried in it. It is inscribed:
In 1686 pressure was put on him to pay the £1095 fee for his baronetcy, but Laurence Hyde, 1st Lord of the Treasury quashed this. Matters were so dire just before his death that he had to sell Hardwick to Sir John Holland and his eldest son had to live off a £20 a year pension from the county rates until even that was withdrawn and he was thrown into the Fleet Prison.
He died in 1694 and was buried at Hardwick. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, Thomas.

Scott Westgarth (10 July 1986 – 26 February 2018) was a British light heavyweight boxer. He died on 26 February 2018 at the age of 31 after sustaining injuries following a victory in a 10-round light heavyweight bout during a Saturday night clash. Westgarth's final fight was widely considered to be the biggest victory of his career.
Career.
Westgarth boxed 10 matches in his professional career, ending with 7 victories, only 2 losses and a draw before his death. He fought in his final bout on 24 February 2018 against Dec Spelman. This was a 10-round light heavyweight eliminator in Doncaster. He defeated Spelman in the elimination match on points and was looking to try to win the English national championship.
Death.
During the final round of the fight against Spelman, Westgarth was knocked down, but was able to recover to ultimately win on points. He went on to conduct a post-match interview before consulting doctors in the dressing room. They sent him to Royal Hallamshire Hospital in an ambulance after concerns for his well-being. During the interview Westgarth held his wrapped hand to his head above his left eye a number of times, suggesting he was in some discomfort.
Westgarth died the next day, 25 February 2018. Westgarth was a registered organ donor, and as a result, his organs were used to save the lives of seven people.

Ann Krcik

Ann Krcik was a senior director of The North Face and a co-founder of Camber Outdoors (originally known as the Outdoor Industries Women's Coalition), the nonprofit created to push women's equality in the outdoor industry. She began working for The North Face at age 26, but left in 1992 to launch Extreme Connection, the first agency to represent athletes and secure endorsement deals and speaking engagements for them. She returned to the retailer in 2011, where she led global brand communications and outdoor exploration, with a strong focus on protecting public lands. She helped establish and lead The North Face's Explore Fund, which provides $500,000 annually to fund programs that increase outdoor access. Krcik was also elected to the Conservation Alliance board in 2015.
Awards.
On January 27, 2018, Krcik received the Lifetime Achievement Award from Camber Outdoors for the decades of mentorship she provided to men and women in the outdoor industry.
In 2005, she won the Pioneering Women Award from then-OIWC (now Camber Outdoors). In 2014, she won an Advocacy Award from Outdoor Industry Association and an American Himalayan Foundation AHF Star Award. In 2016, she was named a Yosemite Centennial Ambassador.

Skinner approached Krcik while she was at The North Face seeking sponsorship for himself and Paul Piana before their first free ascent of the Salathe Wall on Yosemite's El Capitan. Krcik founded Extreme Connection, the first agency to represent outdoor athletes to secure speaking engagements and endorsement deals, in 1992, with Skinner as her main client. He was only the second athlete to be put on retainer by The North Face, which has now sponsored dozens of athletes including Alex Honnold, Emily Harrington, Margo Hayes, Jimmy Chin, Ashima Shiraishi, and Conrad Anker.

The Baldin House, near Ebeneezer, Kentucky, United States, was built in c.1850. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.
It is a two-story, three-bay structure with a Gothic Revival-style gabled roofline.
It was deemed significant "as an example of how Mercer County builders interpreted the Gothic Revival style in their choice of a steeply pitched roof, bargeboards on the eaves, and central wall gable to ornament a single-pile, central passage plan with an ell."

Thomas Hare (MP)

Sir Thomas Hare, 4th Baronet (1686–1760) Stow Bardolph, Norfolk was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1713 and 1715.
Hare was the second son of Sir Thomas Hare, 2nd Baronet of Stow Hall and his wife Elizabeth Dashwood, daughter of George Dashwood of Hackney. He entered Oriel College, Oxford in 1703.
At the 1713 Hare was returned as Member of Parliament for Truro. He opposed the Hanoverian Succession, and in June was awarded a post as first register and clerk of the crown in Barbados. On the accession of King George I he was deprived of his post. He faced impeachment as a member of the previous administration and did not stand for parliament in 1715. He succeeded his brother Ralph as 4th Baronet on 22 September 1732.
He died on 21 February 1760, having married Rosamond, the daughter of Charles Newby of Hooton, Yorkshire. He left 2 daughters and was therefore succeeded by his younger brother George. George died unmarried four years later and the baronetcy then became extinct (although revived in 1818). Stow Hall passed to their sister Mary (married to Thomas Leigh) and her descendants, who later changed their name to Hare.

Early life.
Maria Nikolaevna Yarkina was born on 14 February 1915 in the village of Nizhnyaya Mazovka in Tambov Province, one of several children in a peasant family. Her mother, Praskovia Prokofievna, was an acclaimed local singer.
Yarkina performed in the school choir and in the village club. Even as a schoolchild, she worked as a milkmaid. After finishing school, she joined an amateur theatrical group in Tambov.
Before the Second World War, she was married and widowed. Having taken her husband's surname, she would henceforth be called Maria Mordasova. In 1945, she married the Voronezh chorus' accordionist, I.M. Rudenko. The marriage was a personal and professional success.

Ebro Basin

The Ebro Basin was a foreland basin that formed to the south of the Pyrenees during the Paleogene. It was also limited to the southeast by the Catalan Coastal Ranges. It began as a fully marine basin with connections to both the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, before becoming an endorheic basin during the Late Eocene. In the Miocene the basin was captured by a precursor to the Ebro river and the new drainage system that developed eroded away much of the basin fill, except for resistant lithologies, such as the conglomerates at Montserrat.

Arnaldo Rivera

Arnaldo Rivera (Castiglione Falletto, 13 December 1919 - Castiglione Falletto, 10 January 1987) was an Italian teacher, entrepreneur and partisan.
For almost forty years he was the mayor and the primary school teacher of Castiglione Falletto, so 1958 he founded the Cantina Terre del Barolo, one of the oldest and largest cooperative wineries in Piedmont still active.
Biography.
The childhood, the war and the Resistance.
Arnaldo Rivera was born in a family of winegrowers who produced Nebbiolo grapes in Rivera place, close to Castiglione Falletto. After the primary schools in Monforte d'Alba, he graduated at the Magistral Institute of Alba in 1939 and the following year he left to the military school of Bassano del Grappa, where he was enrolled in the Alpini army division with a rank of lieutenant and destined to the war front, first to the French one, then to shipments to Greece and Russia.
He returned to Piedmont in 1943 and starting from 8 September of the same year he deserted the army and, with the name of "Arno", escaped to the mountains to join the 14th Garibaldi Brigade partisan in the Langhe, with which he participated in some actions against the fascists of the X Mas who tried to reconquest Alba. The long and tortuous path of liberation led him to Turin, where he lived during the exciting days that preceded the Partisan uprising on 25 April 1945 which liberated the city, and few months later he received the proposal to take part in the National Association of Italian Partisans as a Provincial Secretary, but he preferred to return to his town, as desired by his own family.
The return to Castiglione Falletto and the teaching.
In the autumn of 1949 Arnaldo Rivera began his activity as a primary school teacher in Castiglione Falletto. In 1951 he founded a civic list and was elected mayor, following also his political commitment as a former partisan and member of the ANPI. He was an appreciated local administrator because he dedicated himself to the development of the territory, still so strongly marked by the devastation of the war; one of its major achievements was the construction of the Langhe aqueduct, which also benefited the town of Castiglione Falletto. 1956 was the year of his marriage with Esther Rinaldi, who was also a teacher, but no children were born from their marriage.
The foundation of Cantina Terre del Barolo.
In 1958 Arnaldo Rivera wanted to repeat the experience of his father, former founder of a small cooperative winery of local winegrowers, and founded the Cantina Terre del Barolo; while continuing his activities as a primary school teacher and mayor, this project assiduously assured him personally in the development of local resources. Rivera he succeeded in overcoming the widespread distrust of this form of cooperative associations since in the first half of the twentieth century some winegrower consortia had also failed due to a lack of dynamic market. Rivera's constant commitment thus contributed to convincing local winegrowers to participate in the company, safeguarding the interests of the wine sector in the area, threatened by a grapes market characterized by increasingly and strong speculations to the detriment of winemakers. 
On 2 June 1975 Arnaldo Rivera received the nomination of Commendatore della Repubblica conferred to him by the President of the Republic Giovanni Leone for merits in the field of the economy and in the commitment of public offices.
Two years later he left teaching on reaching the age limits but he continued to hold the office of mayor and devoted himself more to the development of Cantina Terre del Barolo, achieving important results and positions of responsibility in various local organizations such as Asprovit and the Consortium of Barolo and Barbaresco, of which he became president in 1978. In 1980 in Verona, during the international edition of Vinitaly, Arnaldo Rivera received the "Gran Medaglia Cangrande" on the recommendation of the Councilor for Agriculture of the Piedmont Bruno Ferraris, a recognition that is awarded annually by the historic Veronese oenological event on the designation of regional administrations.
In one of his speeches during the event organized in 1983 to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of Cantina Terre del Barolo, Arnaldo Rivera said that: «a social entity that acts democratically sharing income in relation to the participation of members can be a winning idea, breaking down the prejudice that men are destined to be armed against each other in the name of individual privilege and egoism».
His dead and the commemorations.
After thirty seven years at the head of the town of Castiglione Falletto and thirty in the presidency of the cooperative winery Terre del Barolo, Arnaldo Rivera died in the late evening of 10 January 1987 for a heart attack that hit him on the return from one of the many sessions of the board of Cantina Terre del Barolo. 
In 1990 the town of Castiglione Falletto inaugurated the new civic library "A. Rivera", dedicated to him, providing it with a catalog of over three thousand volumes, including a specific section dedicated to enology. In 2017, the Cantina Terre del Barolo has also commemorated its founder with a special selection of Barolo DOCG called "ARNALDORIVERA".

Gladys Pott

Gladys Pott (1867 – 13 November 1962) was an English anti-suffragist and civil servant.
Biography.
Gladys Pott was born in 1867, the daughter of the Archdeacon of Berkshire, the Venerable Alfred Pott, and his wife, Emily "" Gibbs. Little is known about Gladys's formative years, except that she was privately educated.
Pott became a committed anti-suffragist, and in 1908 she was appointed secretary of the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League (north Berkshire branch). Through her organisational ability Berkshire became a "stronghold of female anti-suffragism". In 1910 the league joined with the Men's League for Opposing Woman Suffrage to form the National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage (NLOWS) with Lord Cromer as president; Pott joined the executive committee of the organisation and became its secretary between 1913 and 1914. She and Curzon ran a successful campaign to reduce the impact of the league at the Anglican Church Congress in 1912–1913. In 1912 she wrote "The Anti-Suffrage Handbook of Facts, Statistics and Quotations for the Use of Speakers" for use by the league's members.
As a committed and devout Christian, Pott took particular umbrage at the launch in 1910 of the Church Suffrage League. According to the historian Julia Bush, Pott "deeply resented this apparent attempt to appropriate religious sanction to one side of the suffrage argument".
Pott was prepared to directly question militant suffragettes, and would attend public meetings of the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League to put questions to the speakers. The suffragette Kate Parry Frye described Pott as "a most harsh, repellent and unpleasing woman. She began by saying we should not get sentiment from her and we did not". Pott wrote regularly for the "Anti-Suffrage Review", and also undertook a letter-writing campaign in "The Times", particularly in trying to link the non-violent suffragists with the more militant suffragettes, and in identifying financial connections between suffragist and suffragette organisations.
With the outbreak of the First World War Pott stopped her anti-suffrage work to concentrate on work to support the war effort. Along with her friend Dame Meriel Talbot, she worked to organise the Women's Land Army and then, between 1916 and 1919, worked at the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries as an inspector in the women's branch. Between 1920 and 1937 she became the secretary and Chair of the Society for the Oversea Settlement of British Women.
Pott was appointed an OBE in 1923 and a CBE on her retirement in 1937. On 13 November 1961 she died at the age of 94 at her home in Clifton Hampden, Oxfordshire.

J. Henry Roraback

John Henry Roraback (April 5, 1870 – May 19, 1937) was an American lawyer, businessman, and Republican political boss in the state of Connecticut. He was one of the most influential figures in early 20th century Connecticut, and had a national impact as well.
Early life.
Roraback's father John C. Roraback was a farmer, the descendant of German immigrants from one of several settlements named "Rohrbach" in Lorraine who had settled in Columbia County, New York around 1700. He moved his family to Sheffield, Massachusetts in the Berkshires around 1846. Henry (as he seems to have been usually called) was born in 1870 in Sheffield, Massachusetts. He was educated in the local Sheffield schools and then attended high school in Great Barrington. At 19 he moved to North Canaan, Connecticut, where a number of his much older siblings were already established. Living with a sister there, he taught school nearby and studied law with his brother Alberto T. Roraback (1849-1923), a lawyer then serving as a county judge. He was admitted to the bar in 1892. He became a partner in his brother's prosperous practice.
Political career.
Roraback became the chairman of the Republican Town Committee in Canaan and promoted his brother's successful candidacy for the state House of Representatives in 1895. In 1898 he was elected to the Republican State Committee. In 1900 he supported George P. McLean for governor over Donald T. Warner (son of his brother's old mentor Judge Donald J. Warner) and carried Warner's own district for McLean. In 1909 Roraback managed Ebenezer Hill's campaign for the US Senate and nearly unseated Frank Brandegee. In 1910 he managed McLean's successful campaign for the Senate. In 1912 he became Republican state party chairman - a post he retained until his death in 1937.
Under Roraback's leadership the Republicans retained the governorship from 1915 to 1931. Roraback's fiscally conservative policies led to Connecticut paying down its state debt. Roraback was elected to the Republican National Committee in 1920, a position he also held until his death. In 1924 he served as the speaker of the Republican national convention and became a member of the executive committee. In 1932 he became one of the vice-chairmen. By that time Roraback was regarded as one of the "Old Guard" of the party, opposed to reform and strongly opposed to Roosevelt's New Deal.
Business career.
Starting in 1901 Roraback represented the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and was successful in protecting its interests. By 1905 Roraback had taken over and consolidated several small power companies serving Canaan and nearby areas into the Berkshire Power Company with himself as president. He obtained in 1905 a charter for the Rocky River Power Company to develop hydro power on the Housatonic River, rights which finally led to the organization of the Connecticut Light and Power Company in 1917 (with Roraback as president) and the construction of Candlewood Lake to store water and produce hydroelectric power in 1926-8. Roraback also served as president of a number of related power and utility concerns, and as a director of many Connecticut businesses.
Around 1910 Roraback organized the New England Lime Company, a combination of a number of area lime kilns.
Family and death.
Roraback married Mary L. Parsons on April 29, 1896. The couple had twins in 1899, but one child died an infant; his son Lewis survived and on his death in the early 1980s donated 1,976 acres of land in Harwinton to the state of Connecticut, now the Roraback Wildlife Management Area.
Roraback also had an illegitimate son, John Anthony Craig, by his long-time personal assistant Mary Collins.
The Depression caused the Republicans to lose power in Connecticut, and Roraback's control of the party came under increased scrutiny and criticism. A throat infection in 1936 left Roraback in poor health, and he committed suicide on May 19, 1937, shooting himself in the head after a morning hunt with his son. His obituary in Time magazine said,
What Ohio's Marcus Alonzo ("Mark") Hanna did with the Republican Party nationally during the single Presidential generation of William McKinley, whipping Big Business to the Party treasury with fear of Bryan's silver money, cajoling it with protective tariffs and other favors, Boss Roraback did with controlled budgets, legislation favorable to industry, in Connecticut during eight gubernatorial terms.
But public resentment against his dominance never rose very high because, though a monopolist, he was honest and not rapacious. His Yankee instinct was for payasyougo government and that is the kind New Englanders like.

Rumi meets Robbie in court. They sign the papers. On the way, Rumi answers the questions Robbie had asked her. Ultimately, Robbie forgives her and they reconcile.
Production.
The project was originally to be directed by Sameer Sharma, who had shot some portions of the film, but producer Aanand L. Rai was not happy with the rough cut and stopped the shooting. He then approached Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari to direct it, but she could not do it because of her "prior commitments". In November 2016, it was announced that Anurag Kashyap will now be directing "Manmarziyaan" written by Kanika Dhillon. Initially, it was reported by the media that Dulquer Salmaan, Ayushmann Khurrana and Bhumi Pednekar were cast in the film, but they dropped out of the film. Abhishek Bachchan was then brought in as a replacement for Dulquer Salmaan. Abhishek Bachchan and Anurag Kashyap had differences in the past; one of the reasons being Kashyap's criticism of Bachchan's "Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey" (2010). They had however resolved their differences and were excited to work together again when the opportunity arose. The movie marked Bachchan's return to acting after a 2-year hiatus. The film was shot in Punjab, while some portions in Delhi and Kashmir.
Box office.
"Manmarziyaan" was well received at the box office. It collected 4 crore on opening day. The film saw a further jump of 5.70 crore in collections on Sunday. The worldwide gross of the movie was 40.39 crore.
Reception.
"Manmarziyaan" received positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for its contemporary take on a love story and the overall strong performances from its cast. Additionally, it also received high praise for seamlessly weaving its soundtrack into the story. Taapsee Pannu received universal critical acclaim for her performance as the mercurial Rumi. As a love-triangle with a running length of 155 minutes, the subject matter was a venture into conventional Bollywood territory for director Anurag Kashyap. 
Critic Anupama Chopra noted "director Anurag Kashyap, Hindi cinema's high-priest of darkness, turns his ferocious gaze on relationships. Obviously then, this is not the routine Bollywood meet-cute. Director Kashyap and writer Kanika Dhillon have created a fully realized world that is fueled by Amit Trivedi’s pulsating soundtrack" "Times Of India"'s critic Rachit Gupta said "The maturity with which Anurag Kashyap’s "Manmarziyaan" talks about love and relationships is refreshing. The seemingly conventional story of a love triangle, gets original with its treatment and portrayal of love. With characters constantly oscillating between confusion and complex emotions, "Manmarziyaan" presents a new and updated look at romance and relationships."
Raja Sen, writing for "Hindustan Times", critiqued the film saying "There is authenticity to the texture, but this film could have held more. It is ultimately a disappointment not because of its craft, but because of predictability, self-indulgent pace and its irritating attempt to be both a light crowd-pleaser with a cutesy ending as well as an impassioned, volatile romance." "Filmfare" critic Debesh Sharma adds "Shot well by Sylvester Fonseca and edited well by Aarti Bajaj, the film scores on technical fronts as well."
The movie received a limited international release with the title "Husband Material" including a premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2018.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack of the film was composed by Amit Trivedi while the lyrics were written by Shellee except where noted.
The first song, "F for Fyaar", was released on 10 August 2018. The second song, "Daryaa", was released on 11 August 2018. The third song "Grey Walaa Shade" was released on 12 August 2018. The fourth song, "Dhyaanchand", was released on 13 August 2018. The fifth song, "Chonch Ladhiyaan", was released on 14 August 2018. The sixth song, "Hallaa", was released on 15 August 2018. The seventh song, "Sacchi Mohabbat", was released on 16 August 2018. The eighth song, "Jaisi Teri Marzi", was released on 17 August 2018. The ninth song, "Bijlee Giregi", was released on 18 August 2018. The tenth song, "Kundali", was released on 23 August 2018.
Vipin Nair of "The Hindu" gave the soundtrack 4/5 stating that though the "repetitiveness gets in the way on more than one occasion, the composer still manages to deliver a supremely engaging soundtrack, with ample help from Shellee and a bunch of incredible musicians." "The Times of India" based Debarati Sen, in her review, said the lyricist-composer combo ensures that the album "finds a way to your playlist."

Alexander Humphrys-Alexander

Alexander Humphrys-Alexander (1783–4 May 1859) was a claimant to the vacant Earldom of Stirling and rights to vast lands in eastern Canada, referring back to a Royal Charter granted to the 1st Earl by James I in 1621 to colonize Nova Scotia and surrounding areas of North America.
Early life.
Born Alexander Humphrys in 1783, he was the son of William Humphrys, a Birmingham merchant, and his wife Hannah Alexander. In 1802 he accompanied his father to France and was arrested on the orders of Napoleon the following year. They were detained in Verdun. His father died and he returned to England in 1815. At some point he met Thomas Christopher Banks, genealogist and author of a book on the "Extinct and Dormant Baronage of England", who became his adviser.
The claim.
The (then) Alexander Humphrys applied for a royal licence to take the surname Alexander in honour of his maternal grandfather, John Alexander. This was granted in 1824. Following that, he had himself declared the lawful heir of his mother by magistrates in Edinburgh in 1826. He then proceeded to claim the earldom as the descendant and heir of William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling (c. 1567–1640) on 11 October 1830, styling himself ‘Earl of Stirling and Dovan’.
He then moved to claim the Canadian titles and property. These were originally restricted to the direct male line, but Humphrys-Alexander cited a special charter (or ‘Novodamus’) that Charles I had granted in 1639 which obviated this requirement. He was unable to prove the existence of this charter but nevertheless in June 1831, he successfully claimed his Canadian 'property' through the Sheriff of Edinburgh, and was 'invested' with them at Edinburgh Castle on 8 July 1831. He then proceeded to give Banks 16,000 acres of land in Canada and made him a baronet, followed by other attempts to make profitable use of his American interests.
Trial for forgery.
The ambitious scope of Humphrys-Alexander's activities inevitably involved the British government and eventually his claims were challenged, culminating in a celebrated trial in Edinburgh in 1839 in which he was accused of forgery. Eventually at least two of 17 documents were declared to be forgeries, however Humphrys-Alexander himself was acquitted of personal responsibility for making them, after which he left the country to live in Brussels, Paris and eventually America. He died in Washington on 4 May 1859.

Chihui

Chihui () was a concubine of Yuri of Goguryeo. She was the daughter of a man from the Western Han.
Biography.
The "Samguk sagi" records that after the death of his first wife, Queen Song (), King Yuri took Chihui and another woman called Hwahui as concubines. The two women contended for the King's favour, and the level of discord was such that the King built two separate palaces and installed each woman in her own residence.
Once, when the king had been gone for seven days, Chihui and Hwahui were arguing. Hwahui reportedly scolded Chihui, saying 'you are a concubine from a Han family, how is it that you have no manners?' Incensed, Chihui returned to her home. On hearing this, King Yuri pursued Chihui on horseback, but she refused to return with him. He rested under a tree, from where he watched many yellow birds flying. Moved, he composed the "Song of the Yellow Bird".

Micromus tasmaniae

Micromus tasmaniae, known as the Tasmanian brown lacewing, is a species of brown lacewing in the family Hemerobiidae. It is widespread in Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Islands such as New Caledonia and Vanuatu.
Description and ecology.
Adults of the species are 7.5-10 mm long, and are typically nocturnal. The lacewing's lifespan is temperature dependent (higher temperatures causing shorter larval stages). The Tasmanian Brown Lacewing breeds all year round, surviving at temperatures as low as 5°C. The species typically has clear wings and a brown body. The species can be differentiated from "Micromus bifasciatus" by the spotted pattern on the species' anterior wings, compared to the brown transverse bands found on "Micromus bifasciatus".
The lacewings feed on nectar, as well as aphids and psyllids.
Distribution and habitat.
The species is found widely across Australia, and is likely the most common species found in both Australia and New Zealand. The species has been established in New Zealand since at least 1869, and has been identified in remote areas of the country, including the Chatham Islands, Auckland Islands, Antipodes Islands and Kermadec Islands. It has been seen feeding on aphids (especially spruce aphids), and has been found on alfalfa. During the daytime, adults and larvae hide (larvae hiding at the bases of plants in the daytime). The oval-shaped white eggs of the species are often laid on plant hairs and spider webs, close to the species the adults are preying upon.
The species is associated with a wide range of plants and ranges, compared to "Micromus bifasciatus", which is typically associated with "Podocarpus" trees.

Holm House

The Holm House (Danish: Holms Gård) is a listed property located at Gammeltorv 14 in the Old Town of Copenhagen, Denmark. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1926.
History.
The complex was built in 1809 for sugar manufacturer Hinrich Ladiges as a replacement for his old property at the site which had been destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. Ladiges had moved his sugar refinery from Viborg to Copenhagen in 1757. He died as one of the wealthiest men in the country in 1805
Another successful merchant, Lauritz Nicolai Hvidt, lived in the building from 1808 to 1809. He would later become one of the largest shipowners in the country and manager of Bank of Denmark from 1835 and until his death.
A later owner was Christian Holm after whom it has received the name under which it is now known. He was a son of the industrialist and shipowner Jacob Holm.
The linguist Vilhelm Thomsen was born in the building on 25 January 1842. He was a professor of comparative linguistics at the University of Copenhagen from 1887 to 1913 and was awarded the Order of the Elephant in 1812 as one of few non-roral recipients in modern times.
Architecture.
The building facing the square stands in undressed, red brick with sandstone detailing. It is five bays wide and consists of three floors over a high cellar. The gateway opens to a courtyard surrounded by three perpendicular buildings and a rear wing.
Commemorative plaques.
A plaque on the facade of the building Commemorates thatVilhelm Thomsen] was born in the building. It was installed on his 101-year birthsday on 25 January 1943. Inside the gateway is a Commemorative plaque that lists all the names of owners of the site since the 15th century.
Today.
The Drunken Flamingo, a cocktail bar, is based in the ground floor.
Holm &amp; Bertung, a PR agency founded in 1996, is based on the second floor.

Revolt of the Languedoc winegrowers

The Revolt of the Languedoc winegrowers was a mass movement in 1907 in Languedoc and the Pyrénées-Orientales of France that was repressed by the government of Georges Clemenceau.
It was caused by a serious crisis in winemaking at the start of the 20th century.
The movement was also called the "paupers revolt" of the Midi.
It was marked by the fraternization of the 17th line infantry regiment with the demonstrators in Béziers.
Languedoc vineyards before the 1907 crisis.
Mass viticulture.
Wine making in Languedoc developed in the 18th century with the construction of the port of Sète and completion of the Canal du Midi. 
Wine, for which the preservation techniques had been improved, could be transported to new markets.
The vineyards were extended and on the eve of the French Revolution about half the land around Béziers was covered with vines.
In 1853 railway lines began to serve Languedoc, which opened new markets to regional viticulture, particularly in the north of the country and its industrial regions. 
The biggest consumers were the workers, a large part of whose salary was devoted to the purchase of wine.
The French Third Republic by the law of 17 July 1880 facilitated the massive opening of drinking places.
They were mainly in the working-class districts of large cities, with an average of three outlets for five buildings. 
Wine and alcohol consumption skyrocketed.
The beverages sold in these places under the name of wine were extremely poor quality and were often not wine at all.
The damage was such that in the 1890s an anti-alcoholic, syndicalist and socialist movement was born.
A catastrophic half-century.
In 1856 the "Moniteur vinicole", the press organ of the Parisian wine merchants Entrepôts de Bercy, published a "Classification of viticulture departments in order of importance relative to the extent of the vineyards and the quality of the products".
Except for Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne, ignorance was total. 
Almost all the wines of France were ignored by the Parisian trade and the large drinking places.
To mitigate this lack of knowledge, Achille Larive, director of the newspaper, launches a "call to owners of unknown wines". 
On 10 September 1856 he published the results of his inquiry. 
In the next issue a reader pointed out that the wines of small proprietors were ignored.
In the second half of the 19th century French viticulture also faced several crises: powdery mildew, which spread around 1850 by attacking the leaves of the vine and the fruit, then phylloxera in 1863 and at the end of 19th century downy mildew, another fungus that attaches to the back of the leaves. 
It produces oily layers on the leaf surface that cause them to fall early and weaken the vine. 
Thanks to Bordeaux mixture, a compound of Copper(II) sulfate and slaked lime, and the introduction of American plants used as rootstocks naturally resistant to phylloxera, the vines completely recovered.
This did not end the manufacture of fake wines. 
In "Le Monde illustré" of 12 March 1870 an article by Leo de Bernard denounced falsified wine, "petit bordeaux ... made in Bercy, where the tasting service always has its eye and nose open. The containers of this mixture, made of unknown ingredients, are confiscated and placed in a special cell. Their detention does not last long because there is no doubt of their guilt. On the day of execution, the condemned barrels are brought to the bank of the quai d'Austerlitz. A police commissioner ensures that prompt justice is done. When the signal is given the executioner of the high hygienic works opens the flanks of the victim, and from the deep wound a large black flow escapes into the Seine whose hue vaguely recalls logwood, litharge and other harmful drugs."
While everywhere else, especially in the North-West, the area planted with vines was decreasing, it increased in the departments of Aude, Gard, Hérault and Pyrénées-Orientales.
These four provided 40% of French wine production, rising to almost 45% in the first half of the 20th century.
Production in Haut Languedoc grew rapidly, particularly in the Biterrois and Béziers, self-proclaimed "World Capital of Wine". 
Great fortunes were made. Large landowners from industry, finance or the liberal professions had vast estates of several tens of hectares.
Tampered wines appeared on the market to cope with foreign competition. 
Exposed fraudsters were not punished. 
In 1892 the winemakers of the South demanded official suppression of sugaring and reestablishment of customs duties.
But the market continued to be partly supplied by wines made from imported dried grapes, wines diluted with water, chaptalized wines and even "wines" made without grapes. 
However, although vintners gave great prominence to this unfair competition, it did not represent more than 5% of the market.
A demonstration was held in Montpelier on 12 December 1893 and a petition circulated that gathered thousands of signatures opposing fraud and falsified wines. 
The first calls for tax strikes were launched with the support of elected representatives who threatened to resign from their mandates. 
The radical government opposed them with the argument that the wine crisis was caused by overproduction of wine in the South.
Winemaking cooperation, symbol of the Red Midi.
At the start of the 20th century the idea of a winemakers union to improve sales of Hérault wines grew in some communes of the Biterrois. 
The first two to set up a cooperative to sell their wines without intermediaries were Maraussan and Mudaison in 1901.
The Maraussan sales cooperative was created on 23 December 1901 by 128 winemakers.
The initiative proved effective and was copied by Marseillan (1903), Siran (1907) and then Marsillargues and Frontignan (1910).
In 1905 the Maraussan cooperative was the first to set up a joint wine making operation by erecting a building for that purpose. 
Elie Cathala, a distiller who was used to distribution channels, and Maurice Blayac, president of the agricultural and mutual credit union, were instrumental in achieving this goal.
The combination of control over grape production and wine making made it possible to offer a range of wines at diverse prices according to quality.
Jean Jaurès came to salute the initiative on the spot.
On 1 May 1905, during his visit to the new buildings, the socialist leader explained that the peasants had to unite instead of refusing to help each other, using this allegory: "In a vineyard, contrary and mad grapes said that they did not want to go with their brothers who let themselves be picked. They did what they wanted, and what happened was that they rotted on stump, while the others went to the vat, where they made the good wine that rejoices hearts. Peasants, do not stay away. Put together your wishes, and, in the vat of the Republic, prepare the wine of the Social Revolution!".
A large majority of the small cooperating wine growers in Languedoc and Roussillon held socialist or even communist views (pooling of production tools and profits from sales, the basic principle of cooperative cellars), thus forming a Midi Rouge (Red South of France). 
The majority of elected local officials from rural towns or wine-growing areas were the political representatives of the Midi Rouge and in the beginning of 20th century adopted the slogan of Jaurès "Dins la tina de la Republica, preparatz lo vin de la Revolucion sociala!".
Construction of a building dedicated to wine making in Maraussan was decided by the general assembly of 19 February 1905. 
Its production capacity was 2,000,000 liters and it had 29 cement tanks of 50,000 liters each for vinification and storage.
The Free Winemakers of Maraussan became the symbol of wine cooperation and the hope it had aroused. 
The facade of the cellar was always adorned with the motto "All for everyone, everyone for all". 
It was inscribed on the list of historical monuments by decree of 25 May 2001.
Overproduction crisis.
Algerian wine and foreign competition made the overproduction crisis worse, since Spain and Italy also had surplus wine to sell.
Harvests were poor in 1902 and 1903 due to bad weather, and France produced 3,500 to 4,000 million liters. 
The prices of wine in these years were 16 francs, then 24 francs per hundred litres.
In this context in 1903 the government allowed chaptalization of imported wines.
In 1904 and 1905, again because of the weather, harvests were abundant throughout Europe.
The increase in production in the three main European producers was 96% in France, 48% in Spain and 16% in Italy. 
The threshold for a price collapse was 5,000 million liters, and production was 6,900 million.
From 1900 to 1906 the viticulture of Languedoc produced from 1,600 to 2,100 million liters. 
Total French production remained at a high level in the following years: 5,800 million liters in 1905, 5,200 in 1906 and 6,600 in 1907. 
The price of 100 litres of wine dropped to 6 or 7 francs.
Languedoc wine sales deteriorated steadily. 
Abundant harvests inflated stocks that were impossible to sell. 
Some drinking places even sold wine "by time": the customer paid a fixed price and then drank all the wine they wanted ... or that they could drink.
The wine growers reacted to the slump. 
A regional committee was formed for defense of the wine-growing interests of the Midi on 20 January 1905. 
But in Parliament Gaston Doumergue, deputy of Gard, and Félix Aldy, deputy of the Aude, could not make their colleagues take the viticultural issue seriously, and their proposals for defense of natural wine were rejected by the parliamentarians.
In 1905 a demonstration of 15,000 people was staged in Béziers.
A certain Marcelin Albert then launched his "petition of 1905", which collected four hundred signatures.
It read, "The undersigned have decided to pursue their just claims to the end, to go on strike against the tax, to demand the resignation of all the elected bodies and commit all the communes of the south and Algeria to follow their example with shouts of 'Long live natural wine! Down with the poisoners!.
The events of 1907.
There was a crisis in 1907.
The winemakers of Languedoc felt themselves increasingly threatened by wines imported from Algeria through the port of Sète and by chaptalization (adding sugar before fermentation to increase alcohol content).
The country had not experienced such misery since the outbreak of phylloxera. 
The crisis had been building for three years.
Winemakers could not sell their product, people were unemployed and there was general distress.
Wine was still needed after the phylloxera crisis. 
The vineyards of the Île-de-France had disappeared but southern vineyards could replace them thanks to the railways. 
There was no hesitation over adulterating the wine.
The state favored importing Algerian wines, which were mixed with poor quality wines of metropolitan France. 
This practice created a glut of wine that caused the slump in the Languedoc-Roussillon viticulture.
Apart from its role as a distribution center, the port of Sète acted as a catalyst for the crisis. 
Its presence at the center of a large production area created the risk of overproduction by encouraging use of aramon grapes and large vineyards. 
This created volume.
The need to cut these wines to increase strength caused increased demand for Algerian wines, whose production rose from 500,000,000 liters in 1900 to 800,000,000 in 1904.
Strong local production together with the production of fake wines and blends with Algerian wines saturated the consumer market. 
Wine imports, far from diminishing, increased in 1907, aggravating the imbalance between supply and demand. 
This caused the fall of prices and the economic crisis.
As early as January 1907 a warning was given by a report published by the "Revue de la Societe des Viticulteurs de France": "The sweetening of grape harvests was authorized by law only in view of chaptalization, that is to say that is to say, as a means of improving the quality of the wine, and not as a method of increasing its quantity by means of dilution. 
It is therefore legitimate to establish a proportional tax on the natural product thus enhanced. 
The wine associations and oenology committee have long recommended that all regulation of sugaring the grape harvest should include a tax on the sugar used in the harvest".
The small wine growers were ruined and agricultural workers were unemployed. 
There was a domino effect on the whole population, since the ruin of the winemakers entails that of shopkeepers and other trades.
There was misery throughout the region, and the 1906 harvest did not sell.
In February 1907 a tax strike began in Baixas.
Joseph Tarrius, winemaker and pharmacist, circulated a petition to be signed by his fellow citizens entitled: "The municipality of Baixas, unable to pay the tax, is under mass expropriation. It is a tax we can pay and pay again: The tax on blood."
On 18 February 1907 Marcelin Albert took the initiative to send a telegram to Georges Clemenceau.
One historian described Albert as follows: "A small peasant from Argeliers, who looked like a Spanish Christ, Marcelin Albert was a jack of all trades: director of a theatrical troupe, a café owner and a winemaker. In his village he was called "lo Cigal" (the Cicada), because of his whimsical and carefree spirit. 
Since 1900 he had been fighting for the defense of natural wine against fake wine. He was the initiator of the revolt of winemakers that started on 11 March 1907."
Argeliers Committee.
On 11 March 1907 the signal for the revolt was given by a group of Minervois vine growers in the village of Argeliers. 
They were led by Marcelin Albert and Elie Bernard, who founded the Comité de defense viticole (Committee of Viticulture Defense), known as the Comité d'Argeliers (Argeliers Committee). 
They organized a march to Narbonne of 87 vine growers for an interview with a parliamentary commission. 
After their testimony the committee made a tour of the city, for the first time singing "La Vigneronne", which from that day became the anthem of the revolt of the paupers.
The Committee was composed of President Marcelin Albert, Vice-President Édouard Bourges and Secretaries Cathala, Richard and Bernard.
Elie Bernard was later named Secretary General of the General Confederation of Midi Winegrowers(). 
The Argeliers committee, which included all the producers, prepared the response to the crisis.
On 14 March 1907 Albert Sarraut, a native of Bordeaux, senator of Aude and under-secretary of state for the Interior, was ridiculed by Clemenceau for trying to plead the case of his electorate. Clemenceau, President of the Council and Minister of the Interior, told Sarraut, "I know the South, it will all end with a banquet".
In this region, where the Socialists had a strong presence, no well-known elected representative joined the Committee at the beginning.
This allowed Marcellin Albert to present only corporatist claims.
The one and only fight he considered worthwhile was for natural wines. 
He refused to engage in the debate on the divergent interests of the workers and the owners, did not question the presence of royalists who openly wanted to claim the movement, and did not appreciate that on the pretext that the Occitan language is the mother tongue of the Midi wine growers, the regionalists want to make the fight into a separatist movement.
On 24 March the first meeting organized by the Committee of Argeliers was held in front of 300 people in Sallèles-d'Aude. 
Marcelin Albert stood out for his gifts as an orator and his charisma. 
For the winegrowers present he became the apostle, the king of the paupers, the redeemer. 
It was agreed to hold a meeting every Sunday in a different city.
Major demonstrations.
The movement gained momentum. Rallies were organized every Sunday. 
The events mobilized tens of thousands of people, and grew until 9 June 1907.
On 31 March 1907 there were 500–600 protesters in Bize-Minervois. 
On 7 April there 1,000 people in Ouveillan. 
The meeting on 14 April mobilized more than 5,000 demonstrators in Coursan.
On 21 April ten to fifteen thousand winegrowers met in Capestang.
On this day the first issue of "Le Tocsin" was published by the Argeliers Committee.
It as a weekly directed by Marcelin Albert and written by Louis Blanc. 
The first issue contained a request to parliament to pass a law against wine fraud.
On 28 April the rally in Lézignan-Corbières brought together between 20,000 and 25,000 people.
In the month of May there were large gatherings in the prefectures and sub-prefectures of Languedoc-Roussillon. 
The first took place at Narbonne, where on 5 May a rally mobilized between 80,000 and 100,000 people.
The mayor Ernest Ferroul took a stand for the struggle of the Midi winemakers and stigmatized the state.
He told the crowd, "For a long time you have given credit to the state. The time has come where your debt is to be repaid ".
All the viticultural defense committees of the four departments federated and adopted the oath of the federations: "Constituted as a committee of public safety for the defense of viticulture, we all swear to unite for viticultural defense, which we will defend by all means. Anyone who, for reasons of interest, ambition or political will, would prejudice the original motion and thereby render us unable to win will be tried, convicted and executed on the spot ". 
The separatist speeches in the Occitan language worried the government.
On 12 May 1907 these were 150,000 demonstrators at the Béziers rally in the de the Allées Paul Riquet and the Champ-de-Mars.
Slogans on the banners read in French or Occitan, "Victory or death!"; "Enough of speech, deeds"; "Death to fraudsters"; "Bread or death"; "Live working or die fighting"; "To have so much good wine and not be able to eat bread!". 
The demonstrators, who came from more than 200 communes, were joined by many employees and traders from Béziers. 
The event was closed by speeches on the Place de la Citadelle.
Jean-Jaurès spoke and then Marcelin Albert launched an ultimatum to the government asking it to raise the price of wine.
Ernest Ferroul set this ultimatum to expire on 10 June and advocated a tax strike, "If by June 10, the government has not found a solution to the crisis then there will be resignation of the town halls of the South! There will be a tax strike!".
Emile Suchon, Mayor of Béziers and close to Clemenceau, supported the winemakers' fight. 
There were some slight incidents between the appeal and the dispersal of the demonstrators.
That day some demonstrators who could not reach Béziers for lack of a train built barricades on the railway track at the Marcorignan station and blocked all traffic. 
Four days later on 16 May 1907 some winemakers found out the position of the Mayor of Béziers, started a riot and forced him to resign. 
The sub-prefect, on the orders of Clemenceau, called for the army to restore order. 
The same day the City Council of Beziers, socialists with a radical tendency, resigned in turn. 
The street pressure continued. 
The police station and the facade of the town hall were set on fire. 
On 19 May in Perpignan 170,000 to 200,000 people marched in the city. 
The demonstration took place without serious incidents.
Clemenceau counter-attacked at the political level. 
On 22 May his Minister of Finance Joseph Caillaux tabled a bill on wine fraud. 
The text submitted to Parliament provided for an annual declaration of their harvest by wine growers, prohibition of second-cycle sweetening and control and taxation of purchases of sugar.
On 26 May from 220,000 to 250,000 people demonstrated in Carcassonne. 
From the station avenue they passed under a triumphal arch on which was written "Solute to our brothers in misery". 
The speeches to the gathering tried to channel the revolutionary tone of slogans and claims towards the Cathar past of the Occitans, which Ferroul and Albert evoked in turn.
Marcelin Albert said, "The Albigenses were once gathered under these walls, they fell there in defense of their freedom. 
We will do like them! Forward for the defense of our rights! The Midi wants it, the Midi will have it!" 
Ernest Ferroul, a great speaker, played on the secular opposition between North and South, "A memory haunts me, a memory of misery like yours! When the feudal barons invaded the South and sacked it, a troubadour cried like this: 'Ah! Toulouse and Provence, and the land of Argence, Beziers and Carcassonne, who saw you and who sees you!' Since then, the barons of northern industry have invaded and ruined us. We do not want to support them anymore. Forward! Stand up to repel them and their accomplices. Speak up, unite your voice, your prayer will take the tone of a command."
On 2 June 1907 an unprecedented mobilization took place at Nîmes.
The 250,000 to 300 000 protesters arrived in the prefecture of Gard by special trains with reduced rates. 
On the square, out of solidarity a famous confectioner had posted on his facade "Grapes for wine, sugar for candy!".
The Montpellier demonstration.
On 9 June 1907 a gigantic gathering in Montpellier marked the climax of the vineyard challenge in the Midi. 
The Place de la Comédie was invaded by a crowd estimated to number from 600,000 to 800,000 people.
In 1907 lower Languedoc had about a million inhabitants, so one of every two Languedocans was demonstrating. 
The mass mobilization transcended political or ideological views, since sympathizers of the socialist left and the royalist right stood side by side.
This was the largest demonstration of the French Third Republic. 
In his speech Ernest Ferroul, mayor of Narbonne, called for the resignation of all his colleagues from Languedoc-Roussillon. 
He openly advocated civic disobedience. 
Marcelin Albert delivered such a speech that the journalist for "Le Figaro" wrote, "It was mad, sublime, terrifying".
The winegrowers' revolt received the endorsement of all political movements. 
From royalists to radicals, all actively supported the movement. 
All of Languedoc is allied against Georges Clemenceau, president of the Council. 
The Catholic Church even opened the doors of its cathedral and its churches. 
A statement from Bishop Anatole de Cabrieres said that women, children and striking winemakers would be welcomed to spend the night there.
The same day, on the other side of the Mediterranean, about 50 000 people lined the streets of Algiers to support their colleagues in metropolitan France.
A rumor began that the army was ready to intervene.
Pierre Le Roy de Boiseaumarié, a legal student and future president of the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (INAO) and the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) whose family was in Vendargues, set fire to the door of the courthouse of Montpellier to prevent the troops who had been confined inside from shooting at the demonstrators.
The deadline for the ultimatum to the government came on 10 June 1907. 
While Clemenceau counted on a weak and short revolt, the parliamentary commission submitted its report to the Parliament which began to examine Caillaux's bill. 
Faced with deliberate delays in the legislature, Ernest Ferroul decided to announce publicly in Narbonne his resignation as mayor. 
In front of 10,000 people he said from the balcony of the City Hall, "Citizens, citizens I hold my power from you, I return it! The municipal strike begins". 
This position taken in the absence of a government solution was approved by 442 municipalities of Languedoc Roussillon who resigned in the week. 
Black flags adorned the facades of town halls and civic disobedience was declared, the weapon of the elected officials. 
Meanwhile clashes between protesters and law enforcers were becoming commonplace.
On 11 June Jean Jaurès, who defended the vine growers cause in the Chamber of Deputies, filed a counter-bill with Jules Guesde. 
The two socialist deputies proposed nationalization of the wine estates. 
The next day, Clemenceau addressed a half-threatening, half-ironic missive to all the mayors of the wine-growing towns of Languedoc and Roussillon. 
This earned him a scathing reply from Ernest Ferroul: "Monsieur Clemenceau, since the beginning of our demonstrations, has considered us as big children, good boys, but unaware of our actions. 
He is one of those who think that in the Midi everything ends with songs or farandoles. 
He is very wrong, he does not know us."
The head of government then asked Albert Sarraut to bring Ferroul to the negotiating table. 
The former mayor told him: "When we have three million men behind us, we do not negotiate".
Suppression of the revolt.
So far the Sunday demonstrations had been calm and disciplined, and the protesters wanted to remain peaceful. 
However, Clemenceau judged that the law must show strength and appealed to the army to restore order. 
From 17 June 1907 the Midi was occupied by 22 regiments of infantry and 12 regiments of cavalry, with 25,000 infantry and 8,000 horsemen.
The gendarmerie was ordered to imprison the leaders of the demonstrations. 
Sarraut refused to endorse this policy and resigned from the government.
On 19 June Ernest Ferroul was arrested at dawn at his home in Narbonne by troops of the 139th Infantry Regiment and imprisoned in Montpellier. 
Three other members of the viticultural defense committee gave themselves up to the gendarmes at Argeliers. 
News of the planned arrest of all members of the Committee of Argeliers caused an explosion.
The crowd hindered the progress of the gendarmes by lying on the ground. 
Narbonne was in a state of siege.
A spontaneous demonstration began that called for liberation of the members of the Committee and for revenge. 
There were incidents throughout the day, the sub-prefecture was stormed and barricades blocked the streets. 
In the evening, in the general confusion, the cavalry fired on the crowd. 
There were two deaths, including a 14-year-old.
Marcelin Albert, who had not been arrested, was hidden in the belfry of Argeliers. 
A new underground defense committee was formed immediately, with Louis Blanc as leader.
In the departments of Gard, Hérault, Aude and Pyrénées-Orientales municipal councils resigned collectively – up to 600 councilors – and some called for a tax strike. 
The situation became more and more tense, with the furious winegrowers attacking official buildings.
The next day, 20 June, tension rose further and the Midi ignited. 
In Perpignan the prefecture was looted and burned. 
The prefect David Dautresme had to take refuge on the roof. 
In Montpellier the crowd clashed with the armed forces. 
In Narbonne the police inspector Grossot, one of those responsible for the arrest of Ferroul, was taken to task and hurt by the crowd.
To clear it, the troops were ordered to fire on the demonstrators.
Five were killed including a girl aged 20, Julie (called Cecile) Bourrel, who had come to Narbonne by chance on the market day. 
Nearly 33 were injured and lying on the ground.
In the Café Paincourt, which was strafed, the worker Louis Ramon died in agony.
On 22 June 1907 in Narbonne 10,000 people attend the funeral of Cecile. 
This burial was the last great demonstration of the Midi winegrowers. 
In the meantime, Parliament having renewed its confidence in the government, "L'Humanité" of Jaurès carried the headline, "The House acquits the mass killers of the Midi".
17th regiment mutiny.
The 17th line infantry regiment was composed of reservists and conscripts from the region.
It was transferred from Béziers to Agde on 18 June 1907. 
When they heard the gunfire on the evening of 20 June about 500 soldiers from the 6th company of the regiment mutinied.
They looted the armory and moved back towards Béziers.
After a night march of about they arrived in Béziers early in the morning of 21 June, where they were warmly welcomed.
The fraternized with the demonstrators, occupied the Allées Paul Riquet and peacefully opposed the armed forces already in the city.
The soldiers then peacefully settled in the Allées Paul Riquet.
The population offered them wine and food.
The Midi was on the verge of insurrection. 
In Paulhan the railway was put out of action by demonstrators who stopped a military convoy sent to check the mutineers. 
In Lodève the sub-prefect was taken hostage. 
The military authorities could not accept the mutiny which could spread to other regiments of the region.
There was alarm in Paris, and Clemenceau faced a vote of no confidence. 
He played his trump card by telling the military command to hunt down the mutineers in daylight. 
Negotiations followed and in the afternoon, after obtaining a guarantee that they would not be punished, the soldiers of the 17th laid down their arms and went under escort and without any major incident to the station. 
On 22 June they returned to their barracks in Agde by train.
Clemenceau announced the end of the mutiny and won a vote of confidence by 327 votes against 223. 
On 23 June a law was finally passed that stopped massive chaptalization of wine.
After the negotiation and the agreement to move to avoid collective punishment, the mutineers of the 17th were assigned to Gafsa in Tunisia.
They were not assigned to a disciplinary cantonment but retained ordinary military status, so contrary to legend there were no immediate penalties.
However, during World War I (1914–18) because of their reputation as deserters they were likely to be sent to the front line, particularly in the bloody assaults of 1914. 
After these events the army ensured that conscripts performed military service far from home.
The mutiny of the soldiers of 17th is still known by the song by Montéhus, "Glory to the 17th".
The chorus proclaims: "Salute, salute to you, brave soldiers of the seventeenth ...".
Georges Clemenceau was disturbed by the mobilization of the Midi winemakers and the mutiny of 17th that followed. 
The revolt intensified each week and threatened to reach other wine regions. 
Solidarity of local and national elected officials threatened to undermine the government majority. 
But the most disturbing aspect remained the mutiny of the soldiers. 
Governments of the Third Republic used the army to impose their will, and the mutiny threatened to leave them without the force needed to confront a mobilized working class and peasantry.
End of the 1907 crisis.
Marcelin Albert meets Clemenceau.
Unexpected help came from Argeliers. 
Chased by the police, Marcelin Albert was forced to hide and then flee to Paris where he arrived on 22 June 1907. 
The National Assembly, in full debate over the bill against fraud, refused to receive him. 
Georges Clemenceau heard of his presence and agreed to grant him a hearing. 
The premier received him in his role of Minister of the Interior at Place Beauvau. 
During their interview he promised to repress fraud if, in return, Albert returned to Languedoc to calm the rebellion. 
Albert even agreed to be a prisoner. 
Clemenceau signed a safe-conduct for his return to the Aude and gave him one hundred francs to pay for his return by train. 
Albert was naive enough to accept it.
Clemenceau took the opportunity to give his version to the political journalists and stressed the history of the payment. 
The national dailies took this up and Albert's status changed from redeemer to sell-out.
On 24 June Albert was back in Narbonne. 
He met the members of the new defense committee and tried to convince them to suspend the movement. 
However, the interview with Clemenceau had totally discredited him in their eyes.
On 26 June Albert went to Montpellier to become a prisoner.
On his release, no longer wanted in the Aude, he moved to Algeria. 
There the winemakers clubbed together to support someone who had defended their profession, but Albert died in poverty.
Anti-fraud law.
On 29 June 1907 parliament came together to deal with the pressure of events. 
Jean Jaurès warned his colleagues: "The event that is developing down there, and which has not exhausted its consequences, is one of the greatest social events that have occurred in thirty-five years. At first we were not careful; it was in the South, and there is a myth about the South. 
One imagines that it is the land of vain promises. 
We forget that the Midi has a long serious, passionate and tragic history."
The law protecting natural wine against tampered wine was adopted. 
It prohibited manufacture and sale of falsified or manufactured wines. 
All owners must now declare the area of their vineyards. 
The legislature also required declarations of harvests and stocks, and gave trade unions the right to raise charges of fraud for civil trial.
On the same day the deputies enacted a law "to prevent the watering of wines and the abuse of sugar by a surtax on the sugar and the obligation of traders to declare sales of sugar higher than ."
The law of 15 July 1907 completed that of 29 June 1907 by regulating the circulation of wines and spirits.
On 31 August 1907 the government agreed to exempt wine growers from taxes on their crops of 1904, 1905 and 1906. 
On 3 September 1907 a new decree was issued stating that: "No drink may be owned or transported for sale or sold under the name of wine unless it comes exclusively from the alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes or grape juice" . 
As a result fraud became almost impossible. 
On 21 October 1907 another decree established the "Fraud Repression Service" and defined its functions, authority and resources.
General Confederation of Midi Winemakers.
On 15 September 1907 the last issue of the "Tocsin" came out, and the paper became the "Vendémiaire". 
The time of Marcelin Albert was definitely over.
A week later, on 22 September, the Wine Defense Committee was dissolved and the General Confederation of vine growers of the South (CGV) was constituted. 
Its main mission was to fight against fraud and to protect the social and economic interests of producers. 
The first president of the CGV was Ernest Ferroul and Elie Bernard became its Secretary General.
All the imprisoned leaders and members of the Argeliers committee had been released since 2 August 1907 as a gesture of reconciliation.
On 5 October 1907 those considered responsible for the demonstrations and riots were declared liable by the court of assize.
But after appeals were lodged the trials were never held and all were pardoned in 1988.
End of the overproduction crisis.
Pinard of the poilus.
The chronic overproduction was first absorbed by the "poilus" (common soldiers) of World War I (1914–18).
Until then, wine was not part of the soldier's routine in time of peace or war. 
Army regulations said, "Water is the normal drink of soldiers".
In October 1914 the "Intendance militaire"() warned that in the long war that was expected a ration of wine should be added to improve life of the ordinary soldier in the trenches.
This was the origin of "Père Pinard", a very mediocre wine with little or no taste".
Since this was the army the pinard of the poillu was a blend of low-grade red wines such as Maconnais, Beaujolais or Charentes with large amounts of wine from Languedoc-Roussillon, Algeria and Tunisia. The only goal was to reach 9° alcohol.
Every soldier received a quarter of a liter of wine each day, which was relatively easy to supply given the abundant harvest of 1914. 
In January 1916 Parliament recognized that this ration was not enough, and doubled it.
That year, after the Battle of Verdun, Jean Richepin wrote, "In the glasses of peasants, as well as in chalices touched with a trembling hand, let them drink the pinard of the poilus, poured by our silent canteens and paid as much as possible for the benefit of widows and orphans in France".
The pinard was therefore invested with a triple mission, sustain morale while contributing to victory and national unity.
The half-liter ration was increased in January 1918 to three quarters of a liter per day.
The demand from the army was therefore enormous, and in 1918 it requisitioned a third of the French harvest, including colonies. 
The requisitioned wine was left with the producers for storage and withdrawn according to military needs.
In return, the winemaker or wine cooperative received a bonus of twenty centimes per 100 liters per month.
From the cellars the wine was sent to large regional warehouses in Béziers, Sète, Carcassonne, Lunel and Bordeaux. 
From there it was sent to the storage tanks in the rear of the front, replenished every two days. 
Each convoy carried an average of 400,000 liters. 
Immediately packaged in barrels, the pinard was then shipped by train and truck to the front.
The massive supply of wine to the troops had the effect of increasing alcoholism in this generation of men. 
After 1918 there was again overproduction in the vineyards. 
It was partly offset by an increase in wine consumption that lasted until June 1940, when wartime restrictions enforced national abstinence.
Partial conversion of the vineyard.
A solution to the endemic causes of the viticultural crisis was long delayed. 
From the 1920s to the 1970s Languedoc continued to experience successive crises of overproduction and slump. 
It was assumed that the crises were inevitable due to the vine monoculture. 
It was not resolved until the 1960s, when agricultural change was made possible by the Canal du Bas-Rhône Languedoc(), an irrigation canal that brings water from the Rhone to the south of the department of Gard and the east of the department of Héraultin.
This work was spearheaded by Philippe Lamour, "father" of the policy of regional planning in France and in 1955 president of the National Planning Company of the Bas-Rhône and Languedoc region. 
In southern Gard and the east of Hérault water was distributed by the BRL Group.
It was supplied by the National Development Company of the Lower Rhône and Languedoc.
Wines of the pays d'Oc.
The real solution to the crisis was through wine production under the "vin de pays" label. 
The bulk of Languedoc wine production received this label by the decree of 15 October 1987, defended by the Union of Pays d'Oc Wine Producers.
Today "Pays-d'oc (IGP)", until 2009 "Vin de pays d'Oc", is a French regional wine of "Indication géographique protégée" (protected geographical indication, the new name for vin de pays) produced throughout the wine region of Languedoc-Roussillon. 
It is one of the most important of French wines, and accounts for almost half of Languedoc vineyard production, 60% of the volume of all French PGIs with 530 million liters produced in 2009, the equivalent of 760 million bottles. 
It is also the most exported wine, with 210 million liters shipped abroad in 2009, 18% of French wine exports.
The IGP region also contains areas with more restricted terroir: Aude, Pays-d'Hérault, Gard, Pyrenees-Orientales and 57 IGPs with zone denominations.
Centenary of the revolt.
The centennial of the winemakers' revolt of 1907 was included in the list of national celebrations in the year 2007. 
During the celebration of the hundredth anniversary of the revolt of the paupers many exhibitions and cultural events took place in the department of Aude, including Argeliers, birthplace of the movement of 1907, Sallèles-d'Aude and Coursan as well as in Gard and Pyrénées Orientales, and in Herault, Capestang and Béziers.
At the Museum of Cruzy, in the department of Herault, four banners are exhibited that were used during the events of 1907.
They are classified as Historical Monuments.

Sauna Youth

Sauna Youth is a London-based post punk band formed by ex-members of punk bands The Steal and Captain Everything in 2009. They have released three albums, "Dreamlands" (2012), "Distractions" (2015), and "Deaths" (2018), plus various singles.
The current members of Sauna Youth also play in the band Monotony, an alter ego of sorts where they all switch instruments. The two bands released a split single on Upset The Rhythm in 2015.
History.
Sauna Youth formed in 2009 with members living between Brighton and London. The original lineup of vocalist Rich Phoenix (previously of Captain Everything and The Steal), guitarist Lindsay Corstorphine (previously of The Steal), bassist Christopher Murphy, and drummer Reza Mirehsan, made a demo tape titled Planet Sounds, then followed it up with their first single, the self-released "Youth" in 2010. The "Mad Mind" cassette came out that same year, with their second single "Lists" and a split with Ale Mania in 2011.
That year Mirehsan left, Phoenix moved over to drums, and Jen Calleja joined on vocals and sampler. Their first full-length album was co-released by Faux Discx and Gringo Records in 2012. After a single in 2013, "False Jesii Pt. 2," the band began work on their second album. During the sessions they decided to switch instruments and form a second band, Monotony. Before the album's release in June 2015, their new label Upset the Rhythm put out a split Sauna Youth/Monotony single that May.
Sauna Youth have recorded several sessions for Marc Riley on his BBC 6 Music radio show from 2014 to 2016 (as well as one as Monotony). They also appeared as both incarnations on the made for iPlayer live music show he presented in 2015.
In July 2018, the band announced their new album, "Deaths", with first single "Percentages". It was released on 7 September that year, again via Upset The Rhythm. In advance of the album’s release they toured the UK with Protomartyr in August, before which they also played the Visions Festival 2018 pre-party with Fucked Up in London. The following year they headlined a tour honoring the fifteenth anniversary of their label, Upset The Rhythm.

L-MAG

L-MAG is a magazine that is aimed at a lesbian target audience. The German print magazine for lesbians appears bi-monthly and is available in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Luxemburg. Approximately 15.000 copies are printed with each edition. L-MAG is available at over 2.000 outlets (e.g. train station newsagents, selected bookstores and community L-spots) and can also be purchased on subscription and as an e-publication.
The magazine is published by Special Media SDL, which also publishes Berlin's biggest queer city magazine, Siegessäule. The co-founder and editor in chief since its inception is Manuela Kay.
History.
L-MAG originated as an idea of the now deceased publisher Reiner Jackwerth. In 2002, he asked the then-editor of the Siegessäule, Manuela Kay; "What do lesbians who live outside of Berlin actually read?" He then asked her, "Ms Kay, please think of something." For the 2003 Gay Pride season, the first 40 000 copies, with the title "What Lesbians Really Want", were distributed at Pride in Hamburg, Berlin, Cologne, Munich, Frankfurt am Main and Stuttgart. On reflection, Manuela Kay, editor in chief, said, "And then in the summer of 2003, we made the extraordinary journey over six consecutive weekends to six CSD Prides from Hamburg to Munich. It was tough appealing to the somewhat sceptical lesbians who were reluctant CSD participants, who didn't really trust that we knew our way: a magazine for lesbians? That seemed far too new and trivial." Prominent interviewees in the first edition included Ulrike Folkers, Katharina Franck, Tegan &amp; Sara and porn star, Dolly Buster, in "Unexpected Interviews".
Initially, L-MAG magazine was published by Jackwerth Publishing as a free, quarterly A5 publication, in parallel with the then country-wide magazine Lespress, that unlike L-MAG, was not available in general newsagents and outlets. Furthermore, L-MAG was compiled by the Siegessäule team.
From January 2005, the L-MAG went on sale with a print run of 30 000 copies in pocket book format, with over 3 000 subscribers.
At the beginning of 2008, the L-MAG was the first of the German media to interview the President of the DFB (German Football Association), Theo Zwanziger, on the theme of Homosexuality and Professional Football. Gudrun Fertig conducted the interview.
In 2009, there was a complete design relaunch, with a new logo, that is still in use.
After the liquidation of the Jackwerth publishing company, the result of the erstwhile publisher Reiner Jackwerth's retirement, the L-MAG was taken over in May 2012 by part of the media holdings, which were retained and absorbed into the newly established Special Media SDL. Manuela Kay, the editor in chief of L-MAG, as well as the editor in chief of the publishing company's online media, Gudrun Fertig took over as the co-directors of the newly founded publishing house.
Print.
L-MAG is the first magazine for lesbians that has appeared regularly in newsagents since the time of National Socialism. L-MAG regards itself as a journalistically driven magazine in the tradition of the lesbian magazines of the 1920s in Germany, like Die Freundin (The Female Friend/The Girlfriend) and Garconne (Flapper). L-MAG is on a par with Curve in the USA and Diva in the United Kingdom.
L-MAG's focus in the printing field lies in the representation of the diverse lives of lesbian women and a self-evident and a self-confident handling of the theme of being a lesbian. In contrast to the practically invisible presence of lesbians in the mainstream media and society in general, L-MAG celebrates the visibility and participation of lesbian women in all aspects of life. In addition, L-MAG deliberately abstains from reporting on the clichéd themes so predominant in other women's magazines e.g. fashion and dieting. Instead, strong, successful lesbian women are portrayed and national and global lesbian culture is depicted.
The feelings of isolation and being more or less alone in the world, that are so familiar to many lesbians, are countered with multiple portraits, interviews, photos and news that portray the rich diversity and omnipresence of lesbians The desire for positive role models, ideals and pioneers are reflected in L-MAG in the form of portraits and interviews and numerous photo sets.
Among others, L-MAG has interviewed and portrayed famous lesbian role models such as model and actor, Ruby Rose, rock star Melissa Etheridge, singer Kd lang, front woman of the band Skunk Anansie Skin, the performers and makers of the series The L Word, both actors who portrayed the character Lisbeth Salander i.e. Rooney Mara and Noomi Rapace, footballers e.g. Nadine Angerer, Nilla Fischer or Ramona Bachmann, TV presenters Bettina Böttinger and Dunja Hayali, feminist Laurie Penny, supermodel Jenny Shimizu, pop star Beth Ditto, actors Ulrike Folkerts and Maren Kroymann, diverse politicians or unexpected interviewees such as Dolly Buster, Wolfgang Petry or "Bond Girl" Lea Seydoux.
Regular columns in the magazine include international reporting about lesbians in all walks of life: politics, sex, gossip, horoscopes, music, sport, film, books. In addition, every publication deals with a focal theme e.g. family, social media, freedom, friendship, romance, Europe, art, bisexuality.
Online.
From its inception, L-MAG commanded an extensive online presence with news and additional lesbian-focussed services e.g. 'L-Dating', 'L-Events' and the permanent column 'K-Word' with lesbian gossip. In September 2009, the new L-MAG website with a lesbian online portal went live. Since June 2016, the website also offers a mobile version and currently enjoys over 120 000 page impressions per month. (122 164 November 2015, according to the IVW, the German Audit Bureau of Circulation).
Awards.
In 2010, the lead article "European Paradise?" of the May/June 2009 edition, about the European elections, was awarded the European Parliament's Prize for Journalism, in the category 'Print'.
Social Engagement.
To mark its 10th anniversary in 2013, L-MAG initiated and organised the Dyke* March Berlin. Marching under the motto "Lesbian Visibility and Lust for Life", on the eve of the Pride March, a bevy of lesbians took to the streets of Berlin. By doing so, L-MAG sparked a new movement for lesbian visibility in Germany. Cologne (2015) and Hamburg (2016) soon followed suit with their own Dyke Marches.
Miscellaneous.
An early edition of L-MAG, entitled "Counter-public/Underground" was printed to accompany the exhibition "Homosexualities*" (2015) in the DHM (Deutschen Historischen Museum), the German History Museum in Berlin.

Museum of the First Proletarian Brigade, Rudo

The Museum of the First Proletarian Brigade is a museum in Rudo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was established in 1971 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the formation of the 1st Proletarian Brigade, which was formed in the town in December 1941.
History.
Preparatory activities for the establishment of the Museum began in 1966 when a space was adapted in the town's former Cultural Centre ("Dom Kulture"), where documents relating to the formation and history of the First Proletarian NOV Brigade were exhibited. In the square outside the museum, a monument to the First Proletarian Brigade was created in 1961 (designed by architect Branko Kurpjel and incorporating mosaics by Branko Subotić), and at the entrance to the museum was a sculpture of Josip Broz Tito created by renowned Croatian sculptor Antun Augustinčić. In 1992, the latter was removed, and is now held in a private collection in Vojvodina.
In 1971, the Memorial Room of the First Proletarian Brigade was opened, with a new cultural centre and dedicated museum space planned the same year, according to the design of architect M. Bojer. This museum space was officially opened on 4 July 1976.
In late 1995, part of the museum's space was renovated to include a memorial room for soldiers of the VRS killed during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many of the original exhibits were removed, with a number of artistic works being sold by the municipality.
The museum is manned by volunteers from the local SUBNOR committee.

Dassault Falcon 6X

The Dassault Falcon 6X is a large, long-range business jet under development by Dassault Aviation in France.
Development.
Falcon 5X.
Design work began in 2006 under the codename "SMS" for super-midsize, and was envisioned to compete with the Hawker 4000, the Bombardier Challenger 300 and the Gulfstream G200 or the Embraer Legacy 600 with a range. Few details were publicized, except that the model was to be powered by two 10,000-pound-thrust Rolls-Royce RB282 engines.
The project was revamped after the 2008 recession when demand for super midsized and smaller aircraft decreased dramatically, while demand for the large-cabin, long-range models remained vigorous. In 2009, the design was re-evaluated and the engine choice was reassessed.
The 5X was unveiled at the National Business Aviation Association's annual convention on October 21, 2013, to be powered by two Snecma Silvercrests.
Compliant Silvercrest engines were originally planned for the end of 2013 but technical issues led Safran to postpone them to the end of 2017, leading to delay the 5X introduction from 2017 to 2020, and the high pressure compressor issues in the fall of 2017 delayed it further with performance shortfalls, preventing a 2020 service entry.
On 29 January 2016, Dassault Aviation confirmed a two-year delay and production freeze on the Falcon 5X because of ongoing problems with the Snecma Silvercrest engine.
As Dassault endured a near three-year delay to 2020 with 12 cancellations in 2016, it demanded compensation from Safran for the engine delays.
After ground tests in spring 2017 including low and high speed taxi, the 5X made its first flight from Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport with a preliminary version of the engines on July 5, 2017.
The preliminary flight tests were intended to streamline the development program, leading to full flight testing in 2018. That program was planned to fly with certifiable engines for flight validation and type certification, "limiting the consequences of the four year engine development delay as much as possible".
It was then scheduled to enter service in 2020.
By October 2017, the prototype had completed 50 flight hours, testing system performance and basic handling qualities.
Dassault then announced the aircraft's service introduction could be further delayed after Safran discovered high-pressure compressor response problems at high altitudes and low airspeeds on its flying testbed in San Antonio. Dassault did not rule out switching its engine supplier at that point.
The prototype reached Mach 0.8 and 41,000 ft.
Falcon 6X.
On 13 December 2017, Dassault abandoned the Silvercrest due to technical and schedule risks, ending the 5X development. In its place the company launched a new Falcon model with the same fuselage cross section, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada engines and a range, planned for a 2022 introduction.
The new jet will use Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW800s, already powering the Gulfstream G500/G600.
The design was unveiled in February 2018, is forecast to make its first flight in early 2021 and begin deliveries in 2022.
Dassault hopes to launch a larger and longer-range variant of the 6X, to compete with the 7,700nm (14,300km)-range Bombardier Global 7500 and the 7,500nm-range Gulfstream G650ER.
On 6 September 2018, Dassault Aviation and Safran ended their dispute with US$ 280 million in compensatory damages paid by Safran to Dassault.
By October 2018, Dassault had started construction of the lower wing and rear fuselage parts.
By February 2019, the 6X's PW812D engines had accumulated 120 hours of flight tests.
By May 2019, the design was frozen, the engines had 1,000 h of test time, and assembly was expected in 2020 for an on-track program.
By October 2019, the first aircraft's front, main and rear fuselage sections were completed before being assembled and joined with the wing in early 2020.
The Falcon 6X was rolled-out on 8 December 2020. The initial flight was on 10 March 2021.
In 2021, its equipped price was $47M.
Design.
The Falcon 6X is largely based on the Falcon 5X aerodynamics and systems, validated during its preliminary flight test program, but it is optimized to take advantage of its PW812D engines for a longer cabin and a greater range, a Mach 0.90 top speed and a Mach 0.85 cruise.
Its cabin is long, is high by wide (the largest in a purpose-built business jet), and can accommodate 16 passengers in three zones with 29 windows, including a galley skylight.
A front-fuselage extension makes its cabin longer.
The Falcon 6X reinforces the 5X new wing and keeps its digital flight control system and Honeywell Primus Epic EASy III flight deck.
The new engine fans will have a diameter of narrower than in the Gulfstreams, and with four low-pressure turbine stages instead of five, engine weight is reduced by .
Its empty weight increases by or 5.7%, from , due to heavier engines, fuel system and structural reinforcements.
The Falcon 6X will be the first Dassault aircraft with a nitrogen inerting system.

Mass media in the Czech Republic

The mass media in the Czech Republic refers to mass communication methods through broadcasting, publishing, and the Internet and their influence on population.
History.
In November 1989, Czechoslovakia returned to a liberal democracy through the peaceful "Velvet Revolution" (led by Václav Havel and his Civic Forum). In the following years the country went through a rapid economic transformation. This also affected the media that became free of the heavy-handed control of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and were able to develop in a competitive environment. However, even before the Velvet Revolution and despite the persecutions, there were illegally published magazines within the Samizdat phenomenon, which allowed for the circulation of dissident ideas among people who possessed positions of cultural power and authority. Václav Havel – the last president of Czechoslovakia from 1989 until its dissolution in 1992 – was one of them. Since the Soviet Union’s dissolution, most Czech media outlets have been owned by non-Czech western companies. This situation changed after the global economic recession of 2008, when many of them were acquired by Czech firms. In early 2014, eight out of the ten most influential figures in the media were Czech or Slovak.
Media outlets.
Print and online media.
Czech Republic has four main daily newspapers: Lidové noviny (former dissident publication); Mladá fronta DNES (with a centre-right orientation); Právo (with a centre-left political position) and Blesk, all based in Prague. Both Lidové noviny and Mladá fronta DNES are a part of the MAFRA publishing group, owned by Andrej Babiš, the current Prime Minister of the Czech Republic. As of 2018, the MAFRA group is a part of a trust fund along with other Babiš's companies. &lt;br&gt;
Blesk, a tabloid newspaper, with more than 1 million readers per average issue is the most-read national daily newspaper. Blesk’s publisher Czech News Center also publishes Aha!, another tabloid newspaper which focuses on the news about the Czech celebrities. Overall the country accounts for 7 print news outlets and over 20 online news portals. &lt;br&gt;
There has been a decline in circulation on Czech daily newspapers since 2009, which slowed down in 2016. In the same year Seznam Zpravy and Info.cz were launched. The first one, a news site combining daily video, text-based news and video commentaries, was introduced by the country’s leading web portal and second-biggest search engine Seznam.cz and has quickly become the top online news media in the country. On the other hand, Info.cz was launched by the Czech News Center as a news server with the aim of emphasising quality information. &lt;br&gt;
Finally, the Czech News Agency ("Česká tisková kancelář" or "ČTK" in Czech), previously the national state press agency, is the first and main Czech media with domestic and foreign information services. As it is not financed with state budget, its income derives from selling news to subscribers.
Television and radio.
Commercial television has a major place in the Czech media landscape and attracts almost half of the total advertising spend. Before the collapse of communism, the only broadcaster in Czech Republic was the Czechoslovak Television, which was transformed into the public service broadcaster “Czech Television” in 1992. Czech Television operates two terrestrial public broadcast channels: mainstream CT1 and cultural channel CT2, while CT24 (for news) is a digital public channel. The first national commercial licence was granted to Television Nova in 1993. The TV station soon gained a dominant position on the television market managing to keep it so far. Prima televize is the second private national TV channel. Broadcast media regulatory authority is the Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting (RRTV), while public-service ČT is regulated by its own council.
Legal framework.
Freedom of the press and freedom of speech are guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. In Division Two of the Charter, Article 17, these expression rights are defined: however, the Charter prohibits speech that might infringe on national security, individual rights, public health, or morality. Defamation is still a crime in the country, although in 2005 the Constitutional Court ruling found that value judgement is legally protected. Cross-ownership in the media industry is legally limited under the Law on Radio and Television Broadcasting No. 231 of 2001, which defines the license and regulation policy for broadcasting and the role of Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting. However, these ownership restrictions do not apply to foreign ownership and are considered to be “minimal” by some observers. Other important regulations are the Press Law (No. 46/2000), the Act on Czech Television No. 483 and the Act on Czech Radio No. 484. Both began to apply in 1991 and have been amended several times. They provide on the so-called “small” councils that control only Czech Radio and Czech TV (ČT). Moreover, Law No. 106 of 1999 regulates the Free Access to Information, Law No. 45 of 1995 regulates Advertisements and the discipline regarding copyright is provided by Law No. 35 of 1996.
Media freedom and censorship.
In 2021 Reporters without Borders (RSF) ranked Czechia 40 out of 180 countries in its 2021 World Press Freedom Index, down from 13 in 2015. However RSF also underlined the fact that in recent years there had been a “rise of the oligarchs” in the media landscape, and stated that the state-owned broadcaster Czech Television "is facing an upheaval after some of the members of its supervisory board were replaced by well-known figures who are very critical of investigative reporting". In its 2016 report, Freedom House stated that criminal defamation, concentrated media ownership as well as ownership of media by politicians as the main obstacles for media freedom. In 2021 Freedom House stated that Prime Minister Andrej Babiš had been increasing his control over Czech media since 2013, when he bought Mafra media group. During the Covid-19 pandemic Mafra benefited disproportionately from state aid. Some notable incidents concerning media freedom and censorship took place in the country:
According to the Prague Security Studies Institute, there is a pro-Russian disinformation campaign originating from numerous pro-Russian websites, social media communities, printed periodicals as well as radio broadcasts targeting Czechs and Slovaks.
Media ownership.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, all mass media in Czechoslovakia were governed by the state, state organisations or political parties. Since the Soviet Union's dissolution, most Czech newspapers used to be owned by non-Czech western conglomerates: until 2007, 70% of Czech magazines and newspapers were owned by German and Swiss corporations. The process of the media returning to Czech ownership started with the 2008 financial crisis. The restructuring of ownership culminated in 2015 when the German Verlagsgruppe Passau, the last major non-Czech European media group in the country, left the market: it sold its local publishing house Vltava Labe Media to Penta Investments, which owns media holdings both in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia. Despite this media ownership turmoil, research shows that journalists are not affected by the ownership change and tend to view journalism ethics and the ability of journalism to exert power more seriously than before. The new ownership structure of Czech media led to an increase in live news coverage, tabloid-style content and so-called “Google journalism”, although investigative journalism is still strong in the country. On the other hand, the increase of the ownership concentration presents a threat to the media pluralism of the country. Andrej Babiš, current Czech Prime Minister, owns two of the most influential daily newspapers ("Lidové Noviny" and "Mlada Fronta Dnes") and one of the most popular news website "iDnes.cz". However, some experts consider the Czech Republic to be one of the hubs in the EU territory for the few Pan-European media companies controlling large part of broadcasting market in Europe.

Doricles

Doricles (1898 – 1916) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. Although he ran only twice as a two-year-old in 1900 he showed considerable potential when he dead-heated for first places in the July Stakes. In the following year he was a consistent performer at the highest class who contested all three legs of the Triple Crown. He finished second in the 2000 Guineas and the Newmarket Stakes but disappointed when coming home seventh in the Epsom Derby. He ran second again on his next start, before winning his next three races, culminating in a 40/1 upset victory in the St Leger Stakes. He failed to win again and was retired to become a breeding stallion in France.
Background.
Doricles was a "beautiful" brown horse bred in the United Kingdom. During his racing career he was owned by his breeder Leopold de Rothschild and trained by Alfred Hayhoe at the Palace House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk.
Doricles was one of the first crop of foals sired by Florizel II, a high class racehorse and a brother to the Derby winners Persimmon and Diamond Jubilee. Doricles' dam Rosalie also produced St Rosalia, an influential broodmare whose descendants have included Kelso, Alysheba, Farma Way, Bel Bolide and Quiet Reflection.
Racing career.
1900: two-year-old season.
Doricles made his debut in the 48th Triennial Stakes at Ascot Racecourse and finished third behind Veles and Lord Melton. At Newmarket Racecourse on 3 July, Doricles was ridden by Tommy Loates in the July Stakes over five and a half furlongs and started at odds of 10/1. In a "fine race" Doricles dead-heated for first place with Veles with Handicapper among the unplaced finishers.
1901: three-year-old season.
On 1 May 1901 Doricles made his three-year-old debut in the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley mile at Nemarket and started second favourite behind Veles at odds of 4/1. After racing the leaders for most of the way he made steady headway in the last quarter mile, but was never able to get on terms with the 33/1 outsider Handicapper and finished second, beaten two lengths with Osboch in third. Two weeks later at the next Newmarket meeting the colt was moved up in distance for the Newmarket Stakes over ten furlongs and finished second, beaten a head by William the Third, with the 1000 Guineas winner Aida in third, after what was described as "one of the finest struggles ever seen". In the Epsom Derby over one and a half miles on 5 June Doricles came home seventh of the twenty-five runners behind Volodyovski. On 23 July at Liverpool the colt started 5/2 favourite for the eleven furlong Saint George Stakes, but was beaten a length into second place by Fortunatus. At Brighton Racecourse on 7 August Doricles recorded his first success for over a year when he won the ten furlong Brighton Cup "easily" from four opponents. A week before running in the St Leger the colt won again, taking the Champion Breeders' Biennial Foal Stakes at Derby Racecourse by half a length at odds of 4/7.
On 11 September Doricles, ridden by Kempton Cannon, started a 40/1 outsider in a thirteen-runner field for the 126th running of the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. Volodyovski started the 5/6 favourite while the other runners included Fortunatus, Veronese (Prince of Wales's Stakes), Jacobite (Grand Prix de Deauville), Aida and the Irish-bred Revenue. After settling behind leaders for most of the way, Doricles moved into contention in the straight, gained the advantage approaching the final furlong, and fought off the challenge of Volodyovski to win by a neck. Revenue was three lengths back in third place ahead of Pietmaritzburg. Lester Reiff, the rider of the runner-up, lodged an objection to the winner on the grounds of "bumping", but the racecourse stewards upheld the result. The colt's victory was a first classic success for Cannon and the winning time 3.08.4 was a new record for the race.
The Kempton Park Stakes in October attracted a very strong field and saw Doricles finish fourth behind the four-year-old gelding Epsom Lad. Later that month the colt ran in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket and finished third of the three runners behind Osboch and Pietmaritzburg.
Doricles ended the year with earnings of £6,955, making him the fifth most successful racehorse of the season.
1902: four-year-old season.
Doricles remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to recover his best form. In early spring he was beaten by St Maclou in a Biennial Stakes at Newmarket, and then ran unplaced behind First Principal in the City and Suburban Handicap at Epsom.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Doricles an "average" winner of the St Leger.
Stud record.
Doricles was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in France at the stud of the Duc de Gramont. The most notable of his offspring was Consols, who sired the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Massine. He died at the stud of Mr. Prat in 1916.

Eddy Hoost

Edmund Alexander "Eddy" Hoost (21 October 1934 – 8 December 1982) was a Surinamese politician and lawyer. He was Minister of Justice and Police between 1973 and 1977. After the independence of Suriname, he became the first Minister of Defence and served until 1977. He was one of the victims of the December murders.
Biography.
Hoost studied at the Law School in Suriname with Hugo Pos and Harold Riedewald. In 1970, together with Eddy Bruma and Roy Adama, he founded the trade union Centrale-47 (C-47), after mass strikes in 1969, demanded a new and more progressive type of labor organization. C-47 became largest trade union in Suriname, after the Mother Union, a trade union closely connected with the National Party of Suriname. In 1973, Hoost became Minister of Justice and Police in the first National Party Combination (NPK I) cabinet, headed by Henck Arron, on behalf of the Nationalist Republican Party (PNR).
The primary agenda of the PNR was the preparation of Suriname for independence. Once in government, negotiations started with the Dutch government headed by Prime Minister Joop den Uyl. Hoost was part of Surinamese delegation to negotiate the exit out of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. From 1954 until independence, Suriname was, like the Netherlands and the Netherlands Antilles, officially an equal partner within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, but foreign affairs and defense were kingdom affairs. As the Justice minister, Hoost was responsible for the transition of the Netherlands Armed Forces in Suriname (TRIS) into the Surinamese Armed Forces (SKM). After independence on 25 November 1975, Hoost became the first Minister of Defence. During the electoral campaign for the 1977 elections, the PNR ended co-operation with the NPS.
In 1980, a military coup took place in Suriname under the leadership of Dési Bouterse. In 1981, Hoost, together with other former ministers of the NPK I and II, were arrested on charges of corruption. The detainees were tortured and eventually released without a fair trial. He was finally released in 1982. On 11 March 1982, army officers Surendre Rambocus, Jiwansingh Sheombar and Wilfred Hawker staged a counter-coup. The insurgency failed and Hawker was executed, while Rambocus and others were arrested. Hoost, together with the lawyers John Baboeram and Harold Riedewald, took on the defense of Rambocus at his court-martial. On 3 December the court sentenced Rambocus to 12 years in prison with forced labour.
In the early morning of 8 December 1982, Hoost, Baboeram, Riedewald and 11 others were arrested and imprisoned in Fort Zeelandia, while Rambocus and Sheombar were transferred from the Memre Boekoe barracks, Santo Boma prison to Fort Zeelandia. An undisclosed number of individuals were executed, including Hoost. The only survivor was trade union leader Fred Derby, who was freed. Hoost is buried at the Mariusrust cemetery.
Hoost was married. He was father of three daughters and one son.

1892 United States presidential election in Idaho

The 1892 United States presidential election in Idaho took place on November 8, 1892. All contemporary 44 states were part of the 1892 United States presidential election. State voters chose three electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
Background.
This was the first time Idaho participated in a presidential election, having become the 43rd state on July 3, 1890. During its period as a territory Idaho had been divided between a strongly Republican northern half and an anti-Republican Mormon south, which in this first Presidential election was in places (notably Oneida County) still excluded from voting.
A wave of strikes in the silver-mining regions and even deeper conflict whereby an idled ore concentrator was destroyed in Gem, was to give the Populists a grip on the Mountain West that was not to be relinquished. Almost all the large number of dissenting farmers in the new state were to join with the silver interests to back Weaver's policies of nationalization of railways and communications, restriction of immigration, shorter working days and direct election of Senators. Although Senator-to-be William Borah campaigned for Harrison under the slogan that “a vote for Weaver was a vote for Cleveland and therefore against their own interests” Weaver's campaign against Republican Governor Norman Bushnell Willey’s declaration of martial law upon the miners, and against the absentee ownership of Idaho's land and water, ensured that these campaigns for Harrison would not be decisive.
Vote.
Owing to the unpopularity in the West of his gold standard platform, the Democratic Party decided to not enter a Cleveland ticket in the race and to back Weaver. Idaho was won by the Populist nominees, James B. Weaver of Iowa and his running mate James G. Field of Virginia. Weaver and Field defeated the Republican nominees, incumbent President Benjamin Harrison of Indiana and his running mate Whitelaw Reid of New York.

Thomas Russell Gerry

Thomas Russell Gerry (December 8, 1794 – October 8, 1848) was an American sailor who was active in the Sons of the American Revolution and was a son of the fifth U.S. Vice President Elbridge Gerry.
Early life.
Gerry was born on December 8, 1794 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was one of ten children born to Elbridge Gerry (1744–1814), a Founding Father, Massachusetts Governor and U.S. Vice President, and Ann (née Thompson) Gerry (1763–1849), who was near twenty years his father's junior. At his parent's wedding, his father's best man was his good friend James Monroe.
His maternal grandfather Charles Thompson was a wealthy New York merchant who served as secretary of Congress. His paternal grandparents were Thomas Gerry (1702–1774), a merchant who operated ships out of Marblehead, and Elizabeth (née Greenleaf) Gerry (1716–1771), the daughter of a successful Boston merchant.
Career.
On December 6, 1814, Gerry was appointed and served as a midshipman in the United States Navy. His brother, James Thompson Gerry (1797–1854), was commander of the USS "Albany", a United States Navy war sloop, when it was sunk on September 28, 1854. In November 1818, his mother Ann wrote to the Smith Thompson, Secretary of the Navy, soliciting his promotion and expressing thanks for the promotion of his elder brother, Elbridge Gerry Jr. (1793–1867) In February 1822, his brother Elbridge also wrote to the Secretary of the Navy recommending his Thomas' promotion to Lieutenant.
On January 13, 1825, Gerry was promoted to lieutenant. Gerry resigned from the Navy as a lieutenant on August 27, 1833, a few years after his marriage.
Personal life.
On June 30, 1830, Gerry was married to Hannah Green Goelet (1804–1845), the daughter of merchant Peter P. Goelet and Almy (née Buchanan) Goelet. She was the aunt of Robert Goelet, a businessman and yachtsman, and the granddaughter of Peter Goelet, a merchant and real estate developer. Her brother, Peter Goelet, left part of his vast estate to their son Elbridge upon his death in 1879. Together, they were the parents of:
Gerry died on October 8, 1848 in New Rochelle, New York. At the time of his death, his children were very young and had to be raised by their mother.
Descendants.
Through his son Elbridge, he was the grandfather of Angelica Livingston Gerry (1871–1960), who died unmarried; Mabel Gerry (1872–1930), who married Francis Saxham Elwes Drury (1859–1937); Robert Livingston Gerry, Sr. (1877–1957), who married Cornelia Averell Harriman (1884–1966), the second daughter of railroad executive E. H. Harriman and his wife Mary Williamson Averell; and Peter Goelet Gerry (1879–1957), U.S. Representative and Senator from Rhode Island, who was married to Mathilde Townsend and, later, Edith Stuyvesant Dresser (1873–1958), the widow of George Washington Vanderbilt II (1862–1914).
Through his daughter Almy, he was the grandfather of Almy Goelet "Amy" Gallatin (1868–1935), who married Howland Pell (1856–1937); Rolaz Horace Gallatin (1871–1948), who married Emily Lorillard Morris (b. 1873); Jean Buchanan Gallatin (b. 1873), who married George Philip Cammann (1861–1920); Goelet Gallatin (1877–1962), who married Edith Church Post (b. 1882), a step-sister of Regis Henri Post; Albert Gallatin (b. 1880); and Mary "May" Gallatin (1882–1944), who married William Warner Hoppin Jr. (1878–1948), a grandson of Gov.

Bayley Currey

Bayley A. Currey (born October 29, 1996) is an American professional stock car racing driver. He competes full-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving the No. 74 Chevrolet Camaro for Mike Harmon Racing, as well as part-time in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, driving the No. 45 Chevrolet Silverado for Niece Motorsports. Currey has also previously made starts in the NASCAR Cup Series.
Racing career.
Currey started his go-kart racing career in 2003, later moving up to Bandolero racing. After that, he competed at Central Texas Speedway, driving pro late models.
Truck Series.
Currey made his Camping World Truck Series debut at Martinsville at the Texas Roadhouse 200, driving the No. 50 truck for Beaver Motorsports. The offer was brought to him by a personal friend. He started 27th and finished 25th. Currey returned in Phoenix, driving the No. 83 for Copp Motorsports. He started 21st, and finished 10th, surviving multiple wrecks in the process. He drove the No. 83 truck again at Homestead, starting 30th and finishing 28th after an engine failure. Currey wound up running 13 Truck races in 2018.
On February 9, 2019, it was announced that Currey and Vizion Motorsports agreed to run a partial schedule in the No. 35 Toyota Tundra for 2019. The announcement came after Currey tested an ARCA Racing Series car for Vizion. In July, he joined Niece Motorsports for the Gander RV 150 at Pocono Raceway, and later finished sixth with the team at Michigan International Speedway.
In 2020, Currey joined CMI Motorsports for the Strat 200 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. He returned to Niece at Pocono after regular driver Natalie Decker was hospitalized with bile duct complications.
On January 3, 2021, Currey revealed on the "Talking in Circles" podcast that he would return to Niece in 2021 for another part-time schedule. Although plans were for his season debut to take place at Circuit of the Americas, he did so in April at Kansas in the No. 45 truck after regular driver Brett Moffitt switched to Xfinity points. Currey changed his points declaration to the Truck Series on May 4.
Xfinity Series.
A few weeks after competing in the 2018 Stratosphere 200 in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, Currey made his NASCAR Xfinity Series debut at Texas Motor Speedway with B. J. McLeod Motorsports. He qualified 23rd and finished 20th after falling back to 30th at the end of Stage 1 and 27th at the end of Stage 2. Currey returned at Loudon in July with JP Motorsports in their No. 55 entry, and piloted the car for most of the remainder of the 2018 season.
On August 15, 2019, leading into the Food City 300 at Bristol, Currey was indefinitely suspended by NASCAR after failing a drug test; Currey, in a statement, said that the failure was due to a banned ingredient (Octodrine) in a pre-workout supplement. He apologized publicly on the night the suspension was announced and asked NASCAR to enter him in to the Road to Recovery program, which is mandatory for members looking to be reinstated by NASCAR. He was reinstated on September 18 after completing the Road to Recovery. He made his racing return at the Charlotte Roval, where he finished 37th.
Currey joined Mike Harmon Racing for the 2020 season, where he ran much of the schedule in the No. 74. He was elevated to a full-time seat with the team in 2021. In the Call 811 Before You Dig 200 at Phoenix Raceway, Currey posted his and MHR's best career finishes of seventh.
Cup Series.
In March 2019, Currey partnered with Rick Ware Racing for his Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series debut in the TicketGuardian 500 at ISM Raceway. He was slated to run the Bass Pro Shops NRA Night Race at Bristol with Ware until his suspension. Kyle Weatherman took his place in the 52. 
Currey returned to Ware and the Cup Series in May 2020, driving the No. 53 in the Supermarket Heroes 500 at Bristol. In August, he replaced J. J. Yeley during the Go Bowling 235 on the Daytona road course when Yeley required medical attention due to a failed cooling system.
Currey returned to the series in the 2021 Quaker State 400 at Atlanta, driving the No. 15 for RWR.

Karboğazı means literally "snow-pass". It is situated in a high valley around a tributary of Berdan River. The upper reaches of the valley are usually snow-covered. The location was officially included in the Tourism centers of Mersin Province. With a peak at , the area will be developed as a ski resort. Just to the south of the snow covered pass, there is a plateau, which is a popular picnic area encircled by pine forests.
However, Karboğazı is more than a touristic center. This pass was the scene of one of the critical fights during the Turkish War of Independence on 27–28 May 1920, called the Karboğazı ambush. A memorial was erected in the picnic area to commemorate the event.

2018 Canadian federal budget

The Canadian federal budget for fiscal year 2018–2019 was presented to the Canadian House of Commons by Finance Minister Bill Morneau on February 27, 2018 as the omnibus Budget Implementation Act, 2018, No. 1. The deficit was projected to be $18.1 billion, including a $3 billion adjustment for risk. This was later refined to $14.0 billion when the Annual Financial Report of the Government of Canada for Fiscal Year 2018–2019 was released.
Financial situation.
In the "Annual Financial Report of the Government of Canada" for 2018 - 2019, the Minister of Finance said that the budgetary deficit was $14.0 billion for the FY ending March 31, 2019 and that revenues "increased by $21.0 billion, or 6.7 per cent, from 2017–18." There was an increase of 4.7 per cent ($14.6 billion) in program expenses. The federal debt was $685.5 billion and debt-to-GDP (gross domestic product) ratio was 30.9 per cent which is a decrease from 31.3 per cent in 2018. Public debt charges that had reached a peak of about "30 percent in the mid-1990s" were down to "6.7 per cent of expenses in 2018–19." The report said there was strong growth in most regions of the world in 2016 and 2017 and that global economic expansion was more moderate in 2018. Canada's real GDP grew 3.0 per cent in 2017 and 1.9 per cent in 2018. From the fall of 2015 through March 2019, Canada has added 1 million jobs. The unemployment rate reached its lowest level since 1979. 
Oil prices.
Oil prices dropped in the second half of 2018 globally. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil increased to nearly US$70 per barrel in October, 2018 which represents its "highest level since before the oil shock." By December WTI dropped to below US$50 per barrel." As a result of the lower price of oil at the end of the year, Canada's nominal GDP was more moderate in 2018 than 2017.
Highlights.

The Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act under the mask of the Budget Implementation Act 2018, in "Part 4".
SNC-Lavalin affair.
The SNC-Lavalin affair was created as a result of "Division 20 of Part 6".
Environment and Climate Change Canada.
The federal budget presented in February 2018 included an increase in Environment and Climate Change Canada's budget to $1.5 billion which represents an increase of 53.5 per cent "more than it was initially allocated" in 2017 and "23.1 per cent more than it ended up spending" in 2017.

Moray Estate

The Moray Estate in Edinburgh was an exclusive early 19th century building venture attaching the west side of Edinburgh's New Town.
Built on an awkward and steeply sloping site, it is a masterpiece of urban planning. With generous plots accommodating huge townhouses it has accommodated the rich and famous from its outset.
Background.
The ground, extending to 5.3 hectares, was acquired in 1782 by the 9th Earl of Moray from the Heriot Trust. The land contained Drumsheugh House and large gardens lying between Charlotte Square and the Water of Leith. 
In 1822 his son, Francis Stuart, 10th Earl of Moray, commissioned the architect James Gillespie Graham to draw up plans to build over 150 huge townhouses on the land. The houses were set on large plots, even by surrounding New Town standards, and were complemented by a series of private gardens, most notably on the slopes of the Water of Leith.
Sales were begun (from plan) by auction on 7 August 1822. Over and above the cost of the plot, purchasers agreed to a build cost of £2000 to £3000 (depending on the plot) and an annual fee of £30. A "penalty clause" also imposed a fine of £100 on buildings not completed within 30 months. If comparing these prices to the norm, even for the affluent New Town this was perhaps ten times more than might have been expected. While the houses were among the largest ever built, this clearly guaranteed an exclusivity from the outset.
While the majority of plots sold well and quickly (some of the corner plots were less popular, mostly being completed in the 1850s) the scheme as a whole was completed in 1858. The final phase included a central section on Great Stuart Street on the east side between Ainslie Place and Randolph Place, and the two corner blocks on Ainslie Place flanking the access to St Colme Street/Albyn Place.
As one of the most affluent areas in Edinburgh, it set a trend. Glazing was changed to one-over-one format over almost the entire estate by 1950, but when architectural conservation came to the fore in the 1970's, it was one of the first areas to almost wholly restore windows to their original form.
Most basements throughout the estate are now separate properties and many of the blocks are divided into flats.
The entire scheme was designed as a residential enclave with the exception of Wemyss Place, which had ground floor commercial properties and a church in its centre. This church, by John Thomas Rochead does not look like a church and blends very well with the street. It was originally St Stephen's Free Church created in 1845 for Rev Gillies. Whilst intended as residential many properties became commercial through the years and by the 1970s these commercial uses exceeded 50%. This has reversed in recent years.
The gas lighting was not part of the original design. The current form was created by John Kippen Watson in the 1860s was mainly removed and replaced by modern electric lighting in the 1960s. Edinburgh's New Town Conservation Area Committee restored electric versions of the original lamps in the 1980s and these are highly appropriate in appearance.
Form.
The general form of the estate is as four storey and basement houses, set back behind the front basement area, and with a private garden to the rear. The continuous form necessitates a different solution on the corner blocks: these generally have a ground floor and basement duplex unit accessed from the more important street and flats above accessed from the secondary street. These either have no garden or a detached garden. From the pavement a flight of steps gives independent access to the basement, generally a service area. A short flight of steps rise to the main entrance, usually supported on a stone arch.
The buildings are constructed of local Craigleith sandstone with roofs of Scots slate with lead flashings.
The typical interior has a grand open staircase built in stone topped by an ornate cupola giving it daylight, and often embellished with ornate plasterwork. The main room for public entertainment was usually the first floor front room.
Gardens.
The gardens form part of the collection of New Town Gardens. The Bank Gardens between the estate and the Water of Leith extend to 4.1 acres and slope steeply and were raised further to level the estate. A virtually inevitable landslip occurred at the back of the Ainslie Place feus in 1825 and had to be rectified by the addition of structural arches by James Jardine. A further landslip in the south-west corner in 1837 required further arches and these were then re-invented as a high level walkway leading to Dean Bridge. However the southern section of the Bank Gardens did not become fully operational until 1840.
Over and above the Bank Gardens two other substantial private gardens were created: Moray Place Gardens and Ainslie Place Gardens. Of these Moray Place Gardens is sufficiently large and sufficiently screened to provide picnic areas and croquet lawns.
The several garden areas remain the private joint property of the Moray Estate owners (often called the Moray Feuars).
The pavements around the gardens are of "horonised" form. This is created from a series of vertical slivers of granite, created by the squaring of the granite setts on the vehicle surface, thereby making full use of the material.
Moray Place.
Appearing as a circle but actually a duodecagon this is the largest and grandest space within the plan. Technically it is symmetrical around its northwest/southeast axis, but the scale of the form and central gardens makes this impossible to interpret on the ground, and this is only visible from above. Although rear mews were standard at the time of building, the layout only permitted mews on the north-east side (now known as Gloucester Lane).
Lord Moray took one of the largest and most prominent houses: 28 Moray Place. Other notable residents included Alexander Kinnear, 1st Baron Kinnear (2), George Deas, Lord Deas (3), Sir David Baxter of Kilmaron (5), Charles Dundas Lawrie (5), John Learmonth (6), John Sinclair, 1st Baron Pentland (6), Charles Hope, Lord Granton (12), Robert MacFarlane, Lord Ormidale and his son George Lewis MacFarlane (14), John MacGregor McCandlish (18), John Hope, Lord Hope (20), Francis Brown Douglas (Lord Provost) (21), Bouverie Francis Primrose (22), Francis Jeffrey, Lord Jeffrey (24), George Young, Lord Young (28), Andrew Coventry and his son George Coventry FRSE (29), Thomas Charles Hope (31), Sir James Miles Riddell (33), John Fullerton, Lord Fullerton (33), Baron Hume (34), Robert Kerr, Lord Kerr (38), Robert Christison and his sons Sir Alexander Christison and David Christison (40), William Thomas Thomson and his son Spencer Campbell Thomson (41), Thomas Jamieson Boyd (Lord Provost) (41), James Skene (46), Sir James Wellwood Moncreiff, 9th Baronet (47), John Corse Scott (48), James Buchanan (1785-1857) and Rev George Coventry (49)
Ainslie Place.
Named after the Earl's wife, Margaret Jane Ainslie, daughter of Col. Sir Philip Ainslie of Pilton, Ainslie Place stands in the centre of the scheme. The format is an oval circus laid on a south-west to north-east axis, between the two halves of Great Stuart Street.
The scheme has always been popular with Scottish law lords and eminent physicians. Notable residents include John Millar, Lord Craighill (2), William Blackwood (3), Edward Maitland, Lord Barcaple (3), John MacWhirter (physician) (4), John Cowan, Lord Cowan (4), Mark Napier (historian) (6), Reginald Fairlie (office at 7), John Duncan (surgeon) (8), Alexander Bruce (neurologist) (8), James Ivory, Lord Ivory (9), James Gregory and his eminent sons Donald, William, Duncan and James all at 10, Sir William Edmonstone (11), George Cranstoun, Lord Corehouse (12), John Hay Forbes, Lord Medwyn (17), James Spence (surgeon) and George Burnett, Lord Lyon (21), Neil Kennedy, Lord Kennedy (22), Francis Cadell (artist) and his actress sister Jean Cadell (22), John Rankine (legal author) (23), Dean Edward Ramsay and his brother Admiral Sir William Ramsay (23) in later life (see Darnaway St), Very Rev James Robertson (25)
Randolph Crescent.
This street forms the entrance into the estate from the south. Randolph Crescent Garden was originally retained by Lord Moray and Graham's plan showed a large mansion in the centre, probably as a replacement to Drumsheugh House. It was ultimately decided this was not a good location to build.
The elevated ground level in the central garden is partly due to the placing of excess soil here during original construction. It facilitated a large air raid shelter being constructed here during the Second World War.
Notable residents include Edward Gordon, Baron Gordon of Drumearn (2), William Mackintosh, Lord Kyllachy (6), Robert Smith Candlish (9), Erskine Douglas Sandford (11), William Campbell, Lord Skerrington (12), and James Stevenson and his daughters Flora and Louisa (13).
Randolph Cliff.
The dramatic entrance to the Moray Estate from Dean Bridge begins with Randolph Cliff, which stands dramatically over the Water of Leith far below. It was one of the final sections to be completed (and quite an engineering feat) and is laid out as flats rather than houses. The corner block as a complex stair to access the main stair, unlike any other block on the estate.
Randolph Place.
Somewhat detached from the rest of the estate, Randolph Place never had the same allure as housing and from the outset seems to have attracted office use. 
Two famous architects had their offices here: Alexander Hunter Crawford at 10 and Reginald Fairlie at 14.
Great Stuart Street.
Split into two halves by Ainslie Place, this street is named after the Earl's family name of Stuart and his additional title of Baron Stuart (granted in 1796). It forms the links between the main sections of the estate.
Notable residents include Dr Alexander Monro (1), Sir Robert Christison (3), Harold Stiles (9), John Murray, Lord Murray (11), Lt Gen Thomas Robert Swinburne (13), William Henry Fox Talbot (13), James Warburton Begbie (16), William Edmonstoune Aytoun (16) and William Henry Playfair (17).
Doune Terrace.
Named after the Earl's country estate of Doune and family title (from 1581) of Lord Doune, this street links Moray Place to the lower streets around Stockbridge.
Notable residents include James Craufurd, Lord Ardmillan (2) and Thomas Balfour, James Kinnear and James Pitman, Lord Pitman (9) .
St Colme Street.
This street is named after the family title of Lord St Colme (granted in 1611) and links Ainslie Place to Queen Street.
Notable residents include George Angus (architect) (1), Thomas Guthrie Wright (6), Helen Kerr (6), and Andrew Rutherfurd, Lord Rutherfurd (9).
Harold Tarbolton had his office at no.4 and was later joined by Matthew Ochterlony.
Lord Rutherfurd employed William Notman to remodel his building in 1835, soon after it was built.
Albyn Place.
Named after Glen Albyn on the Aberdeenshire estates, this short section is a continuation of St Colme Street linking to Queen Street.
Notable residents include William Forbes Skene founded Skene Edwards WS (offices at 5), Aeneas James George Mackay (7), David Mure, Lord Mure (8), Prof Thomas Stewart Traill (10), Prof David Low (11)
Darnaway Street.
Named after the family seat of Darnaway Castle, this short street links Moray Place to Heriot Row, then and still an exclusive Edinburgh address.
Notable residents include Thomas Duncan (painter) (1), William Kirk Dickson (3), George Joseph Bell (6), Edward Ramsay (7), Archibald Campbell Swinton and his son George Swinton (7), James Buchanan (1785-1857) (8), John Steell (11) and Robert Matthew (12).
Forres Street.
Named after the family estate of Forres, this street connects Moray Place to Charlotte Square.
Notable residents include Thomas de Quincey (1), Thomas Chalmers (3), Robert Omond (4), John Montgomerie Bell (4), Ramsay Traquair (4), Sir Alexander Kinloch (5), David Paulin (6) and Archibald Fleming (9), James Maidment (10).
Glenfinlas Street.
Named after the family rural estate of Glenfinlas in the Trossachs, this short street formed the north-west connection to Charlotte Square and appears a completion of the square. Due to boundary/ownership issues between the Moray Estate and Charlotte Square the final block was not completed until the late 20th century (the only block built as an office).
Notable residents include John Hughes Bennett (1).
Wemyss Place.
Named after the Earl of Moray's step-mother, Lady Margaret Wemyss, daughter of David Wemyss, 4th Earl of Wemyss Wemyss Place is peripheral to the estate and visually links more to Queen Street and Heriot Row. It is one of the few sections built with a mews (accessed through a central pend). The central block was built as St Stephen's Free Church and in WW2 its open interior allowed use as a drill hall for Edinburgh's Home Guard and rather ridiculously (under the wartime rules) had to be painted in camouflage colours (making it very obvious). Repainted grey after the war it was only restored to natural stone in the late 20th century.
Notable residents include George Smith (Scottish architect) (8), William Guy (dentist) and John Smith (dentist) (11)

International Board Game Studies Association

The International Board Game Studies Association (IBGSA) is an academic professional association "devoted to the history and development of board games throughout the world". The IBGSA sponsors an annual scholarly conference, the BGSA Colloquium, as well as an academic peer-reviewed journal, "Board Game Studies". The IBGSA's membership includes academics, museum curators, game designers, archivists, and collectors.
History.
The International Board Game Studies Association grew out of a colloquium organised by Dr Irving Finkel at the British Museum in 1990. A volume of papers related to this event was subsequently published by the British Museum Press as "Ancient Board Games in Perspective". After the initial colloquium, Dr Alexander de Voogt, then of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, convened a second colloquium, held at the University of Leiden in 1995. It was agreed by the members of the International Board Game Studies Association to meet biennially, and the next event was held at Leiden in 1997. An associated journal, sponsored by the University of Leiden, was established and the first volume of the "Board Game Studies Journal" was published in 1998.
The colloquium continued as a biennial forum, meeting in a different European city every two years, while the journal was published annually. From 2002, the colloquium became an annual event. The journal was discontinued as a physical publication after seven issues, but reconstituted as an online journal on the De Gruyter platform. The annual Board Game Studies Colloquium is now the largest and single most important academic conference related to the study of board games. It has occasionally been hosted outside Europe, but it now established as a European event.

Joseph John Jefferson

Joseph John Jefferson (1795–1882), usually referred to as John Jefferson, was a British Congregationalist minister and advocate for Christian pacifism.
Biography.
Historian Martin Ceadel asserts that Jefferson's pacifist position was most likely inspired by one of his congregants named John Scott. Scott died in 1832 and as minister for the Independent Meeting House at Stoke Newington, Jefferson delivered the eulogy. Jefferson was elected as secretary of the London Peace Society on 11 August 1840. In 1845, he spoke publicly in a series of lectures in London sponsored by the Society along with George Thompson, Henry Richard, and John Scoble. The lecture series was attended by a total of 64,000 people. Jefferson hoped they would spread Christian pacifism, specifically opposition to all wars as a Christian principle. In 1846, he was one of the first sixty signers of the League of Universal Brotherhood Pledge, along with Joseph Sturge and James Silk Buckingham. He retired suddenly as secretary of the Peace Society on 4 January 1848 due to poor health, but shortly afterwards in May 1848 he was made vice-president of the Society. He lived for another 34 years and remained an inactive vice-president until his death in 1882.
Jefferson served as the minister for Abney Park Chapel and cemetery in Stoke Newington for more than a quarter of a century.

Lily Argent

Lily Argent (10 August 1886 – 13 December 1916), Lily Bumster from November 1913, was a petty criminal from Swansea, Wales. She grew up in a home in which drunkenness and crime were commonplace, and received her first criminal conviction at the age of 19. She was arrested for theft, along with fellow prostitutes Kate Driscoll and Selina Rushbrook, in 1905. She was found not guilty, and the experience appears to have deterred her from a life of crime; she instead became a prostitute. Following the death of her mother in 1906 Argent descended into alcoholism.
In 1913 she married Michael John Bumster, the son of the owners of the boarding house in which she was living. The relationship was to be brief, as less than a year later her husband enlisted in the army on the outbreak of the First World War. Lily Bumster, by this time suffering severe tuberculosis, died in late 1916.
In her lifetime, Argent attracted little notice beyond official records and local newspaper accounts. Her life was examined by local historian Elizabeth Belcham in her book "Swansea's 'Bad Girls': Crime and Prostitution 1870s–1914."
Early life.
Lily Argent was born on 10 August 1886 in Swansea. Her parents were William Argent, a local stonemason, and Margaret Argent née Webb, a servant in an eating house in Cross Street, Swansea; the family lived in Madoc Street, Swansea. Lily was the second of the Argents' six children. Throughout Lily's childhood, Margaret Argent and her sisters Annie Price, Harriet Griffiths and Elizabeth Winter made regular appearances in the courts for alcohol-related public order offences. 
The young Lily Argent grew up in an environment in which drunkenness, crime and violence was commonplace. She made the first of her many appearances in court in October 1898, when she testified on behalf of her mother in a case in which labourer James Davies was accused of breaking Margaret Argent's leg; Davies denied the charges, claiming that Margaret Argent had sustained the injuries falling over while trying to attack him.
Adult life.
In August 1905, having moved out of the family home in the intervening years, the 19-year-old Lily Argent received her first criminal conviction, a prosecution for drunkenness. As was customary at the time for a first offence, she was discharged on condition she enter the local workhouse. Within weeks she was arrested again and given a 10s fine (about £ in terms) for fighting in the High Street. By this time she had been discharged from the workhouse and was lodging in The Strand in Swansea.
 As a young woman with no means of support these arrests did not discourage her from crime, and on 17 November that year she was arrested, along with her friends Selina Rushbrook and Catherine Driscoll (both well-known local thieves and prostitutes), for the theft of a sea captain's purse containing £5 10s (about £ in terms). On this occasion, all three were found not guilty of the theft on grounds of insufficient evidence.
It appears that this narrow escape finally turned Lily Argent away from a life of crime, and she was never again to be arrested for theft, although she continued to work as a prostitute. In 1906 Margaret Argent died from cerebral softening and eclampsia. Her daughter gradually became an alcoholic, and in May 1909, after not coming to the notice of the authorities for over three years, Lily Argent was again arrested for riotous behaviour and imprisoned for a month. She was arrested yet again for drunkenness in February and December 1910; on the latter occasion, the arresting officer described her as "using most abusive and indecent language".
Marriage and death.
By this time Argent was living in Michael and Margaret Bumster's boarding-house at 68 Strand, and continuing to work as a prostitute. Along with fellow prostitute Annie Boatwright, she was one of only two unmarried female boarders in an otherwise entirely male establishment. In November 1913 Argent married the Bumsters' son, Michael John Bumster. Their relationship was to be brief; on the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Michael John Bumster—who had previous military training—enlisted in the army. On 26 October 1914 Lily Bumster was again prosecuted for assault, the last of her arrests. On 13 December 1916, by this time suffering from severe tuberculosis, Lily Bumster died of cardiac failure, aged 30. She was buried, along with her parents, in the family plot in Danygraig cemetery.

The statue was accepted in the collection by Senator Allen Ellender on April 25, 1941. At that time Ellender said, “He was a doer of things for the benefit of the masses; and his philosophy of distribution of wealth, his advocacy of pensions for the aged, shorter work hours for labor and his continued fight for the masses ….. marked him for death.”
Long, a popular populist nicknamed “The Kingfish” was first Governor and then Senator from Louisiana and was assassinated in Baton Rouge on Tuesday, September 10, 1935.
A very similar statue, without the raised right arm, of Long by Keck was unveiled in 1940 on the grounds of the Louisiana State Capitol.

Thomas Mann Randolph Sr.

Thomas Mann Randolph Sr. (1741–November 13, 1793) served in the Virginia House of Burgesses, the Revolutionary conventions of 1775 and 1776, and the Virginia state legislature. Married twice, he fathered 15 children. One marriage was to a cousin, Anne Cary, with whom they had 13 children. His second marriage, which resulted in two children, caused a dissention among family members. The youngest son, with the same name as his half-brother, Thomas Mann Randolph, inherited the family plantation, Tuckahoe plantation. Randolph expanded upon the house that began to be built during his parent's short marriage. Orphaned as a young boy, Randolph continued work on Tuckahoe when he came of age. He also purchased Salisbury house, which was used during his lifetime as a hunting lodge.
Early life.
Randolph was the only son of William Randolph III (1712–1745) and Maria Judith Page (died 1744), the daughter of Mann Page of the Rosewell plantation. The Randolph family of Virginia were among the First Families of Virginia. He was the grandson of Thomas Randolph of Tuckahoe and descendant of William Randolph (c.1650–1711).
Randolph's parents were married in 1736 and her father provided a £2000 sterling dowry that was used to built an "elegant new two-story mansion. By 1742, Maria Page Randolph had died. William Randolph died in 1745. William Randolph stipulated in his will of late 1745 that he wanted his good friend Peter Jefferson and his first cousin and Peter's wife, Jane Randolph Jefferson, to take care of his son and two daughters at Tuckahoe Plantation and provide the children a good education until Thomas Mann Randolph came of age. Peter Jefferson also managed the plantation's business affairs.
The Jeffersons left their residence at Shadwell, Virginia, with their three daughters and son, Thomas Jefferson, in 1746. Second cousins, Randolph and Thomas Jefferson were close during their childhood at Tuckahoe. The boys were tutored at Tuckahoe on English spelling, grammar, and composition. Thomas Jefferson maintained relationships with his Randolph family members, particularly the Randolphs at Tuckahoe.
Marriages and children.
In 1761, Thomas Mann Randolph Sr. married Anne Cary (1745–1789), the daughter of Archibald Cary and Mary Randolph Cary of Ampthill. Anne and Thomas were second cousins. He came of age in 1762. Randolph worked on construction of the mansion sometime between 1760 and 1765, perhaps partially funded by a dowry for his wife. The house came to have an h-shaped layout, with a north wing, hyphen, and a south wing. The mansion was built for a large family and entertaining. Construction was completed by 1769 when Englishman Thomas Anburey visited Tuckahoe. He wrote that the mansion
Ann Cary and Thomas Mann Randolph had thirteen children, which include:
Ann Cary Randolph died in 1789. In 1790, a few months after his first wife's death, the 49-year-old Thomas Mann Randolph Sr. married Gabriella Harvie, the daughter of John Harvie Jr. She was 17 years of age, and he was more than twice her age.
The children of Gabriella Harvie and Thomas Mann Randolph are:
The children from Randolph's first marriage did not visit Tuckahoe after the second marriage.
Career.
Randolph served during the Revolutionary War where he acquired the name "Colonel Randolph". He served in the Virginia House of Burgesses, the Revolutionary conventions of 1775 and 1776, and the Virginia state senate in 1776. He was a member of the House of Delegates from 1784 to 1788 and was County Lieutenant of Goochland County.
Salisbury house.
In 1777, Thomas Mann Randolph Sr. purchased the Salisbury house from Abraham Salle (a Huguenot descendant of Abraham Salle (1670–ca. 1719)). The estate in Chesterfield County, Virginia (14 miles from Richmond, directly across the River from the Randolph-owned Tuckahoe) became a Randolph family hunting lodge. In 1784 Patrick Henry lived at Salisbury during his second term as Virginia governor (1784 to 1786).
Death.

Hillbilly Elegy (film)

Hillbilly Elegy is a 2020 American drama film directed by Ron Howard, from a screenplay by Vanessa Taylor, based on the 2016 memoir of the same name by J.D. Vance. The film stars Amy Adams, Glenn Close, Gabriel Basso, Haley Bennett, Freida Pinto, Bo Hopkins, and Owen Asztalos, and follows a Yale law student who must return to his family in Ohio after a family emergency.
After buying the rights to Vance's book in 2017, Imagine Entertainment announced Howard as the film's director. Netflix acquired the distribution rights in January 2019, and much of the cast joined that April. Filming took place from June through August in Georgia and Ohio.
"Hillbilly Elegy" was released in select theaters in the United States on November 11, 2020, then digitally on Netflix on November 24. The film was criticized, particularly for its screenplay and direction, and received three nominations at the Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Director for Howard, Worst Screenplay for Taylor, and Worst Supporting Actress for Close. However, the performances of some of the cast received praise, with Close receiving supporting actress nominations at the Academy Awards, the Golden Globe Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards. Adams's performance was also recognized by the Screen Actors Guild, with a nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress. The film also received Academy Award and BAFTA Award nominations for Best Hair and Makeup.
Plot.
The film opens in Jackson, Kentucky in 1997. An adult J.D. is looking back to this time, his teenage years, as he visits his family with his grandparents and mom, Bev, in their current home in Ohio.
Fourteen years later, J.D. is attending Yale University, working three jobs to pay his tuition, and dating a young woman named Usha. She has a summer internship in Washington D.C., and J.D. hopes to get one there as well. He attends an event to network in hopes of landing the internship, but then gets a call from his sister, Lindsay; Bev has just been rushed to the hospital after overdosing on heroin. Lindsay is overwhelmed by the situation as she is already busy supporting her three children. She asks J.D. to come home, which he feels conflicted about since he fears losing his shot at the internship.
He remembers growing up with the many conflicts he had with Bev, who is mentally and emotionally unstable, suffers from drug addiction, and always had trouble earning enough to take care of him and his sister, Lindsay. He remembers one such conflict where a fun day with Bev at a sports cards' store turns into an ordeal on the drive home, when, after an argument, Bev drives recklessly, stops abruptly on the side of the road, and repeatedly hits him. He runs out of the car to a nearby house and calls his grandmother, while a passing police officer intervenes. His grandparents come to pick him up and he gets Bev out of trouble by lying to the cops about what happened.
Back in 2011, J.D. makes up his mind and starts to drive to Ohio. He arrives at the hospital to find his mom yelling and making a scene. He finds out that the hospital intends to throw Bev out as she has no health insurance. J.D. gets a call and is informed that he has an interview at Yale tomorrow morning.
In 1997, J.D.'s grandfather dies and the family arranges a small funeral. Bev gets a job as a nurse and uses her position to steals drugs. She gets high, acts erratic, gets fired, and later breaks down over her father's death. In 2011, J.D. and Lindsay find their mother a bed at a private drug rehabilitation facility despite J.D.'s concern that Bev, having gone to rehab several times before, is incapable of overcoming her addiction. His fears prove founded when Bev refuses to go back to rehab.
In 1997, J.D., Lindsay, and Bev move into the home of her new husband, Ken. Bev continues to feed her addiction and neglect J.D. and Lindsay. J.D.'s grandmother, who had largely raised him in Bev's place, falls and is hospitalized with pneumonia. J.D. starts vandalizing and acting out with his new step-brother, Travis, and his friends. In 2011, Her boyfriend Ray tired of dealing with her drug problems, throws her stuff out of his apartment and abandons her. In 1997, J.D.'s grandmother, after recovering from her hospitalization, takes him to live with her. J.D. soon starts excelling in school and begins to work towards making something of himself. He grows up, joins the United States Marine Corps, goes home when his grandmother dies to help with her funeral, and uses the G.I. Bill to go to college. In 2011, J.D., having convinced Bev to let him pay for her motel room and some food, drives back to Yale for his interview. As he drives he talks to Usha on his cellphone. He arrives back in time for his interview, surprising Usha. In the last scene we see him going into the interview.
Production.
Imagine Entertainment won the rights to the memoir in an April 2017 auction, for Ron Howard to direct. In February 2018, Vanessa Taylor was set to adapt the novel into a screenplay. In March 2018, Ron Howard was spotted at the Buckingham Coal Mine near Corning, Ohio, scouting possible locations in Perry County. In October 2018 and March 2019, Howard was spotted in Middletown, Ohio, again scouting filming locations.
In January 2019, Netflix won the rights to the film after bidding $45 million on the project. Glenn Close, Amy Adams, Gabriel Basso and Haley Bennett joined the cast in April. In June 2019, Freida Pinto, Bo Hopkins and Owen Asztalos were added.
Principal photography began on June 12, 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia, and wrapped on August 8, 2019, in Middletown, Ohio, after a 43-day shooting schedule. Several days of filming took place in the book's setting of Middletown, Ohio, though much of the filming was done in Atlanta, Clayton, and Macon, Georgia, using the production code-name "IVAN." Hans Zimmer and David Fleming composed the film's music.
By January 2020, the film was in post-production.
Release.
"Hillbilly Elegy" began a limited theatrical release in the United States on November 11, 2020, then streamed on Netflix starting November 24.
It was the most-watched film on the site in its first day of release, before finishing third in its debut weekend. Over its second weekend the film fell to eighth place.
Reception.
Critical response.
Critical response to "Hillbilly Elegy" was "fairly negative", but the performances of its cast received some praise. On Rotten Tomatoes, 25% of 249 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.60/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "With the form of an awards-season hopeful but the soul of a bland melodrama, "Hillbilly Elegy" strands some very fine actors in the not-so-deep South." According to Metacritic, which calculated a weighted average score of 38 out of 100 based on 43 critics, the film received "generally unfavorable reviews".
"The Independent" reported that the film was widely criticized for "perpetuating stereotypes about the poor". Katie Rife of "The A.V. Club" called it "bootstrapping poverty porn" and said that it "reinforces the stereotypes it's meant to be illuminating."
Owen Gleiberman of "Variety" wrote "As long as Close is acting up an award-worthy storm (her performance is actually quite meticulous), "Hillbilly Elegy" is never less than alive. Amy Adams does some showpiece acting of her own, but as skillful as her performance is, she never gets us to look at Bev with pity and terror." For IndieWire, David Ehrlich gave the film a "C–" and wrote ""Hillbilly Elegy" hinges on Mamaw's hope that she'll leave her family better off than she found them, and it's clear that Vance's story has fulfilled that wish almost as soon as this movie starts. But the process of watching him cut his losses and recommit to his own success is rendered in a way that it isn't just dramatically unsatisfying in the extreme, but also on the verge of sociopathic."
Peter Travers from "Good Morning America" thought the film was a "missed opportunity" but Close's performance was "sensational". He concluded "With greater emphasis on simplicity instead of Hollywood showboating, "Hillbilly Elegy" might have been more than a missed opportunity." In her positive review, Sandra Hall from "The Sydney Morning Herald" praised Howard's "high-end brand of commercial movie-making" and opined that he's "to be applauded just for inviting Close, with her wealth of imagination and technique, to give us everything she has." Richard Roeper from the "Chicago Sun-Times" gave the film a perfect 4 out of 4 star rating, praising Adams' and Close's "exceptional work", describing Adams as a "tour de force" and Close as "masterful, screen-commanding, pitch-perfect."
Rahul Desai of Film Companion wrote "The film is shameless Oscar-bait. But as with most recent Ron Howard movies, he has a way of making bad movies feel good."
Accolades.
Glenn Close became the third performer in history to be nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Raspberry Award for the same performance.

HMS Cormorant (1804)

HMS "Cormorant was probably launched in 1803 at Howden Pans as the merchant ship Blenheim". The Admiralty purchased her in June and the Royal Navy took her into service to use her as a convoy escort. Then in 1809 it converted her into a storeship. After the Admiralty sold her in 1817, she resumed the "Blenheim " name and returned to mercantile service as a West Indiaman. She disappeared after 10 November 1821 and was presumed to have foundered.
"Blenheim".
"Blenehim", of 327 tons (bm), only enters the "Register of Shipping" in 1806. It gives her master as Lamb, her owner as Hurry &amp; Co., and her trade as Shields–London. She does not appear in "Lloyd's Register".
HMS "Cormorant".
The Admiralty purchased "Blenheim" in June 1804. "Blenheim" underwent surveying by Perry &amp; Co., Blackwall, between 26 May and 8 June 1804. The Admiralty purchased her in June, and she then underwent fitting at Woolwich between 8 June and 30 July.
In June Commander James Stewart commissioned "Cormorant" for the North Sea. On 20 August 1805 "Cormorant" captured "Liefde". "Cormorant" sent "Liefde", Geret, master, into Yarmouth. "Liefde" had been sailing from Husum to Amsterdam.
"Lloyd's List" reported on 23 August that "Cormorant" had sent into Yarmouth "Vrow Jan___". She had been carrying a cargo of indigo to Embden.
In October 1805 Commander John Phillimore replaced Stewart.
On 11 March 1806 "Cormorant" and were in company at the capture of "Minerva". Phillimore left "Cormorant" in October, and Commander William Hughes replaced him.
On 13 February 1807 "Cormorant" recaptured the brig "Hope". The French privateer lugger "Revanche", of Cherbourg, had captured "Hope", Blake, master, off Dunnose, Isle of Wight, that day as "Hope" was returning to London from Madeira. "Hope" arrived at Portsmouth within the day.
Hughes sailed "Cormorant" in March 1807 to the Cape of Good Hope. On 26 January 1808 she captured the Dutch East Indiaman "Marianne". "Cormorant" sent "Marian", Kofoed, master, into the Cape on 8 February. She had been sailing from Batavia to Copenhagen. The Vice admiralty court at the Cape condemned "Marianne" and remitted £40,000 to the Registry of the High Court of Admiralty in London.
"Cormorant" also detained and sent into the Cape three American vessels:
Between October 1808 and July 1809 "Cormorant" underwent fitting as a storeship. She was recommissioned in April.
However, "Lloyd's List" reported on 24 March 1809 that the sloop-of-war "Cormorant" had detained "Batavia", sailing from Rochelle to New York. "Batavia"s crew regained possession of her, but then the letter of marque detained "Batavia" again. "Irlam" came into Liverpool, from where she went on to Barbados. A later report credited with the first capture, not "Cormorant", and reported that "Batavia"s master, cook, and steward had recaptured "Batavia", this time from "Irlam"s prize crew, and had taken "Batavia" into New York, her original destination.
In 1813 Mr. W. Kirby was "Cormorant"s master. He sailed her to the Cape in company with , which was sailing to the East Indies. On the way, on 11 June, they boarded "Ainsley", Brown, master, which was returning to Liverpool from Africa.
"Cormorant" returned to Portsmouth on 18 December. She had sailed from the Cape on 5 September, and from Saint Helena on 23 October. She had been in company with a number of whalers and other vessels, including .
In 1814 "Cormorant" sailed to Newfoundland. In 1815 Mr. T. Hodgson became her master.
Disposal: The "Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy" offered the "Cormorant storeship, of 328 tons", lying at Chatham, for sale on 3 April 1817. She finally sold to Moates, at Chatham, for £1450 on 4 December 1817.
"Blenheim" again &amp; fate.
"Blenheim" reentered "Lloyd's Register" in 1818 with Souter, master, S. Moates, owner, and trade London–Honduras. A tremendous gale hit the southeast coast of England on 5 March, damaging or even wrecking many vessels. "Blenheim", Souter, master, bound for Honduras, was blown out of The Downs.
The "Register of Shipping" for 1823 showed "Blenheim" with Webster, master, S. Moats, owner, and trade Bristol–Jamaica. "Lloyd's List" reported on 26 March 1822 that "Blenheim", "late Webster", master, had departed from Annato Bay, Jamaica, on 10 November 1821 for London. There was on further trace of her and she was presumed to have foundered with the loss of all hands.

Racing career.
Starting at age four in go-karts, Diaz ran at Dominion Speedway in both Champ Car and Bandolero entries until age twelve. He later moved up to Legends car racing and late model racing, eventually running in the Pro All-Stars Series (PASS) during his late model days. He later started racing frequently at Southern National Motorsports Park.
Diaz made his first and to-date only NASCAR Camping World Truck Series start in 2017 at Martinsville, driving the No. 86 Chevrolet Silverado for driver Brandon Brown's Brandonbilt Motorsports team. He started 9th and finished 23rd.
Diaz made his Xfinity Series debut at Richmond's fall race in 2018, driving for Brandonbilt Motorsports in the No. 90 car, using owner points from DGM Racing. He would run three more races for Brown's team the following year in their own No. 68 and 86 cars.
In 2019, when Diaz was racing at the 2019 Snowflake 100 at Five Flags Speedway, he was approached by a representative from Venturini Motorsports, and the two initially agreed to a deal that would have put Diaz in the team's No. 20 Toyota in the ARCA Menards Series in the races that Chandler Smith was ineligible to drive in. However, this deal was later changed to have him run the full season in the ARCA Menards Series East instead.
Diaz continued racing in the now-ARCA Menards Series East in 2020, where he finished fifth in points with a best finish of third at Dover International Speedway, with additional starts coming in the ARCA Menards Series West. He returned to the Xfinity Series in late October when he joined Sam Hunt Racing for the final two races of the season at Martinsville Speedway and Phoenix Raceway.
On January 19, 2021, it was announced that Diaz would be leaving Venturini and joining Visconti Motorsports, driving their No. 74 car full-time, with it being Diaz's second full-time season in the East Series.

He graduated on June 5, 1935, and was commissioned second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on the same date. Some of his classmates reached the general officer rank later: Robert E. Cushman Jr., Eli T. Reich, Eugene Fluckey, Ralph M. Metcalf or Arnold F. Johnston.
Weede was subsequently ordered to the Basic School at Philadelphia Navy Yard for his basic officer training which he completed in February 1936. With 124 students, it was the largest Basic School class to that date. This class provided two future Marine Corps Commandants (Leonard F. Chapman Jr. and Robert E. Cushman Jr.), five lieutenant generals (Lewis J. Fields, Frederick E. Leek, Herman Nickerson Jr., William J. Van Ryzin, Weede), five major generals (William R. Collins, William T. Fairbourn, Bruno Hochmuth, Raymond L. Murray, Carey A. Randall) and six brigadier generals (William W. Buchanan, Odell M. Conoley, Frederick P. Henderson, Roy L. Kline, John C. Miller Jr., Thomas F. Riley).
He was subsequently attached to the 1st Battalion, 10th Marines at Quantico, Virginia. His unit was attached to the 2nd Marine Brigade in October 1936 and served in San Diego, California and Guam until July 1940. He was meanwhile promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in July 1938.
World War II.
Following his return to the United States, Weede was ordered to Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina and attached to the newly activated 4th Defense Battalion under Major George F. Good. This new kind of Anti-aircraft/coastal defense units was designated for the defense of naval bases in South Pacific against potential threats. With the activation of 5th Defense Battalion at Parris Island in December of that year, Major Good transferred Weede to his unit. Weede was promoted to the rank of captain in March 1941.
After the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, Captain Weede was transferred to 2nd Defense Battalion in January 1942. The battalion was already sent to the Pacific, and Weede served at American Samoa under Lieutenant Colonel Raymond E. Knapp as commanding officer of the 5-Inch Artillery Group. He was promoted to the rank of major in May 1942 and to lieutenant colonel in May 1943.
Weede led his unit to Tarawa at the end of November 1943, following the main landing and the battalion under his command repelled several enemy bombing raids. He was subsequently ordered to the United States for instruction at Field Artillery School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma in January 1944, but rejoined his unit in May of that year. The 2nd Defense Battalion was already redesignated 2nd Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion and Weede served as its commander until October 1944.
He was subsequently transferred to the 10th Marine Artillery Regiment, 2nd Marine Division and appointed commanding officer of 2nd Battalion. Under his command, 2nd Battalion took part in the practice for its next combat deployment – Okinawa.
The 2nd Battalion was part of the floating reserve for the Okinawa invasion, but toward the end of June 1945, commanding general of 10th Army, Lieutenant general Simon B. Buckner requested fresh units to reinforce main forces exhausted by weeks of combat. The Second Marine Division provided 8th Marines under the command of Colonel Clarence R. Wallace and Weede and his 2nd Battalion to support them.
Weede landed with his unit on Okinawa at the noon of June 16 and quickly deployed his battalion. He led artillery attack on the village of Makabe and helped destroy remnants of Japanese forces, which were preparing for counterattack. Three days later, the island was declared secured and Weede and his regiment were ordered back to Saipan. For his service during Tarawa and Okinawa campaigns, he was decorated with the Bronze Star Medal with Combat "V".
Postwar service and Korea.
Lieutenant Colonel Weede returned stateside in July 1945 and was attached to the Bureau of Ordnance, Navy Department under Vice Admiral George F. Hussey. He served in Washington until August 1947, when he was ordered for Senior Course to the Marine Corps Schools, Quantico. Upon the graduation from the course in June 1948, Weede served consecutively as Supervisory Instructor within Senior Course and assistant director of the Junior Course. He was also promoted to the rank of colonel in June 1950.
During the Korean War, Weede was ordered to Far East in May 1951 and appointed assistant chief of staff for operations, 1st Marine Division under Major General Gerald C. Thomas. He served in that capacity until the end of August of that year and was simultaneously the divisional chief of staff for brief period. Weede then assumed command of 5th Marine Regiment at the beginning of August of that year and took part in the frontline patrols and rear area security missions.
Following the breakdown of armistice negotiations in August 1951, the United Nations Command decided to launch a limited offensive in the late summer/early autumn to shorten and straighten sections of their lines, acquire better defensive terrain, and deny the enemy key vantage points from which they could observe and target UN positions. Colonel Weede led his 5th Marines to the action on September 15 and during the Battle of the Punchbowl and took part in the assault on the Kanmubong Ridge, where captured the Hill 812. He was decorated with the Legion of Merit with Combat "V" for his leadership of 5th Marines at Punchbowl.
Weede was appointed again divisional chief of staff in November 1951 and remained in that capacity until February 15, 1952. He was succeeded by Colonel Custis Burton Jr. and ordered to the United States under rotation policy. Weede received his second Legion of Merit for work as chief of staff and two Air Medals for his participation in liaison and reconnaissance flights over the frontline.
Upon his return, Weede served at Headquarters Marine Corps as a member of the Fleet Marine Force Organizational Structure Board and of the Naval Examining Board until August 1952. He was then ordered for an instruction at Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, and graduated in June 1953.
Later service and Vietnam.
His next assignment was at Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, where he served as a member of Advanced Research Group. This group was tasked with the development of the recommendations on how the MAGTF should evolve structurally to meet the challenges of atomic warfare and new technologies such as helicopters and jet aircraft. The members of the group were Thomas J. Coolley, John P. Condon, August Larson Joseph N. Renner, Carson A. Roberts, Samuel R. Shaw, George R. E. Shell, Eustace R. Smoak and William J. Van Ryzin.
He was reassigned to the Headquarters Marine Corps in July 1954 as assistant personnel officer under Major General Reginald H. Ridgely Jr. and served simultaneously with the Marine Corps Table of Organization Board until July 1956. This duties were followed by assignment as chief of staff, 1st Marine Division, at Camp Pendleton, California. He served under Major General Edward W. Snedeker until May 1958 and took part in several exercises.
Weede was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in June 1958 and appointed commanding general of Marine Corps Recruit Training Command at Marine Corps Base San Diego. He departed San Diego and was transferred to Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii in November 1959 and relieved Bridagier General Frederick L. Wieseman as commanding general of 1st Marine Brigade. His brigade served as the "middleweight" global crisis response force and was able to "operate independently, as a service component, or to lead a Joint Task Force. While in this capacity, Weede was promoted to the rank of major general in August 1961.
He left Hawaii at the beginning of February 1962 and sailed for Saigon, South Vietnam to be appointed Chief of Staff of newly created Military Assistance Command, Vietnam under General Paul D. Harkins. Within this joint-service command, Weede was co-responsible for all units operating in Vietnam until May 1964. He subsequently received Navy Distinguished Service Medal for his service in this capacity.
Upon his return stateside, Weede was appointed assistant chief of staff for operations at Headquarters Marine Corps and remained in this capacity until July 1965. He succeeded then Major General Lewis J. Fields as director of personnel and served until May 31, 1967. Weede distinguished himself again and received the Navy Commendation Medal.
Weede was nominated for the rank of lieutenant general by the president, Lyndon B. Johnson, in May 1967 and subsequently promoted on July 1 of that year. For his new billet, Weede was ordered to Norfolk, Virginia, and appointed commanding general of Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic. He also simultaneously served as commanding general of II Marine Expeditionary Force.
He retired from the Marine Corps on August 31, 1969, after 34 years of active service. At his retirement ceremony, Weede was decorated with his second Navy Distinguished Service Medal for his service with Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic.
Retirement.
Richard G. Weede settled in Portsmouth, Virginia, where he died in Portsmouth Naval Hospital on October 22, 1985. He is buried together with his wife Margaret Dunton Weede (1912–2005) at Arlington National Cemetery. They had one son, Richard Dunton Weede, who also served in the Marine Corps and reached the rank of colonel.

Tristram Kennedy

Tristram Edward Kennedy (27 June 1805 – 20 November 1885) was an Irish Liberal, Whig and Independent Irish Party politician, and lawyer.
Family.
Born at Inishowen, County Donegal, Kennedy was the twelfth child of Church of Ireland clergyman John Pitt Kennedy and Mary Cary, daughter of Thomas Cary. In 1862, he married Sarah Helen Margaret Graham, daughter of George Templar Graham and Frances Margaret Golightly, and together they had seven children:
Legal career.
He was educated at Derry Free Grammar School, becoming an attorney and then, in 1828, High Sheriff of Londonderry City. In that role, he chaired a lengthy and controversial debate between Protestant and Catholic clergyman, winning admiration from both sides. However, in 1829, he was struck off the roll of attorneys, and entered Lincoln's Inn and King's Inns in Dublin, before being called to the bar of Ireland in 1834, aiming to improve legal education standards.
In doing this, he opened the Dublin Law Institute in 1839, starting the education of a subject not taught systematically in Ireland for at least 200 years. This campaign to reform legal education was widely supported, and helped by Waterford City MP Thomas Wyse. It was also said to stimulate the academic study of English law at British and Irish universities, sped up the introduction of qualifications, and pointed out ideological rationale at the time that attorneys must attend English law inns before being able to practice on the Irish Bar.
In 1846, the House of Commons select committee on legal education, chaired by Wyse, produced a report on legal education, influencing the future of both English and Irish legal education.
However, this law school entered troubled times and collapsed in 1845, leading to Kennedy shortly after ending his legal career and becoming a land agent on the 13,500-tenant Bath estates in County Monaghan, where he "sternly refused to adopt any of the cruel remedies applied in other quarters" during the Great Famine, and allowed tenants to run great arrears. Fewer than one in four tenants were able to read and write, leading Kennedy to establish seven new national schools. This work, and his initiation of the Carrickmacross lace industry, is largely credited to his later election to Parliament.
Political career.
He was elected MP for County Louth as a Whig candidate in 1852 before joining the Independent Irish Party just after the election. Whilst in Parliament, he contributed primarily to debates on landlord and tenant matters, or national and industrial education. Standing in this capacity in 1857, he lost the seat. At the 1859 general election, he stood as a Liberal for King's County, but ended at the bottom of the poll.
He was re-elected as a Liberal candidate at a by-election in 1865 and held the seat until he stood down in 1868, after a sectarian campaign waged by Matthew Dease, the successful Liberal candidate. In 1874, Kennedy stood for election in Donegal, but was unsuccessful.
Later life.
Kennedy was also a member of the Dublin Social and Statistical Inquiry Society, visiting Belgium to inspect responses to poverty in that country and then, in 1855 with W. K. Sullivan, publishing a booklet on industrial training. He later, in 1877 and 1878, published two tracts on the reform of law and legal education.
Kennedy died in 1885 at his home, Charleville, The Shrubbery, Weston-super-Mare, Somerset and was buried at Cossington village church.

Salvelinus grayi

Salvelinus grayi, also called Gray's char[r], Lough Melvin char[r] or freshwater herring, is a species of lacustrine char fish in the family Salmonidae.
It is only found in Lough Melvin, Ireland; numbers of fish are declining and the species is considered critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
Taxonomy.
Name.
The describer, Albert Günther, named the fish after his longtime colleague John Edward Gray. The English word "char[r]" is thought to derive from Old Irish "ceara"/"cera" meaning "[blood] red," referring to its pink-red underside. This would also connect with its Welsh name "torgoch", "red belly."
Description.
This species grows to an average length of and a weight of . Compared to other members of the "Salvelinus" genus, it has a deeper body that is more laterally compressed, a shorter caudal peduncle and larger scales. It can be distinguished from other char by the whitish spots on upper flank and caudal and dorsal fins.
Biology.
"Salvelinus grayi" is benthopelagic, living at 10–30 m (30–100 ft), except during the spawning season. It feeds on water fleas (crustaceans of the order Cladocera). It spawns in November, in shallow rocky areas.
Conservation.
Recorded numbers in Lough Melvin declined from 33 in 1975 and 42 in 1986, to only 12 in 2001, and the species is considered critically endangered. Common rudd introduction and eutrophication are blamed for the decline. In 2003, a plan to relocate some of the fish to a nearby reservoir failed when no fish could be found despite extensive search. Nor was the fish observed to be spawning in its traditional spawning locations. The lake has experienced increasing levels of phosphorus as a result of agricultural activities in its catchment area, and char are notoriously sensitive to phosphorus. Another factor in the fish's decline may be the introduction into the lake of rudd and roach.

History of the Tesla coil

Nikola Tesla patented the Tesla coil circuit on April 25, 1891. and first publicly demonstrated it May 20, 1891 in his lecture "Experiments with Alternate Currents of Very High Frequency and Their Application to Methods of Artificial Illumination" before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers at Columbia College, New York. Although Tesla patented many similar circuits during this period, this was the first that contained all the elements of the Tesla coil: high voltage primary transformer, capacitor, spark gap, and air core "oscillation transformer".
Invention.
During the Industrial Revolution the electrical industry exploited direct current (DC) and low frequency alternating current (AC), but not much was known about frequencies above 20 kHz, what are now called radio frequencies. In 1887, four years previously, Heinrich Hertz had discovered Hertzian waves (radio waves), electromagnetic waves which oscillated at very high frequencies. This attracted much attention, and a number of researchers began experimenting with high frequency currents.
Tesla's background was in the new field of alternating current power systems, so he understood transformers and resonance. In 1888 he decided that high frequencies were the most promising field for research, and set up a laboratory at 33 South Fifth Avenue, New York for researching them, initially repeating Hertz's experiments.
He first developed alternators as sources of high frequency current, but by 1890 found they were limited to frequencies of about 20 kHz. In search of higher frequencies he turned to spark-excited resonant circuits. Tesla's innovation was in applying resonance to transformers. Transformers functioned differently at high frequencies than at the low frequencies used in power systems; the iron core in low frequency transformers caused energy losses due to eddy currents and hysteresis. Tesla
 and Elihu Thomson independently developed a new type of transformer without an iron core, the "oscillation transformer", and the Tesla coil circuit to drive it to produce high voltages.
Tesla invented the Tesla coil during efforts to develop a "wireless" lighting system, with gas discharge light bulbs that would glow in an oscillating electric field from a high voltage, high frequency power source. For a high frequency source Tesla powered a Ruhmkorff coil (induction coil) with his high frequency alternator. He found that the core losses due to the high frequency current overheated the iron core in the Ruhmkorff coil and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings. To fix this problem Tesla changed the design so that there was an air gap instead of insulating material between the windings, and made the iron core adjustable so it could be moved in or out of the coil He eventually found the highest voltages could be produced when the iron core was omitted. Tesla also found he needed to put the capacitor normally used in the Ruhmkorff circuit between his alternator and the coil's primary winding to avoid burning out the coil. By adjusting the coil and capacitor Tesla found he could take advantage of the resonance set up between the two to achieve even higher frequencies. He found that the highest voltages were generated when the "closed" primary circuit with the capacitor was in resonance with the "open" secondary winding. 
Tesla was not the first to invent this circuit. Henry Rowland built a spark-excited resonant transformer circuit "(above)" in 1889 and Elihu Thomson had experimented with similar circuits in 1890, including one which could produce 64 inch (1.6 m) sparks,
 and other sources confirm Tesla was not the first. However he was the first to see practical applications for it and patent it. Tesla did not perform detailed mathematical analyses of the circuit, relying instead on trial and error and his intuitive understanding of resonance. He even realized that the secondary coil functioned as a quarter-wave resonator; he specified the length of the wire in the secondary coil must be a quarter wavelength at the resonant frequency. The first mathematical analyses of the circuit were done by Anton Oberbeck (1895) and Paul Drude (1904).
Tesla's demonstrations.
A charismatic showman and self-promoter, in 1891-1893 Tesla used the Tesla coil in dramatic public lectures demonstrating the new science of high voltage, high frequency electricity. The radio frequency AC electric currents produced by a Tesla coil did not behave like the DC or low frequency AC current scientists of the time were familiar with. In lectures at Columbia College May 20, 1891, scientific societies in Britain and France during an 1892 European speaking tour, the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia in February 1893, and the National Electric Light Association, St. Louis in March 1893, he impressed audiences with spectacular brush discharges and streamers, heated iron by induction heating, showed RF current could pass through insulators and be conducted by a single wire without a return path, and powered light bulbs and motors without wires. He demonstrated that high frequency currents often did not cause the sensation of electric shock, applying hundreds of thousands of volts to his own body, causing his body to light up with a glowing corona discharge in the darkened room. These lectures introduced the "Tesla oscillator" to the scientific community, and made Tesla internationally famous.
Wireless power experiments.
Tesla employed the Tesla coil in his efforts to achieve wireless power transmission, his lifelong dream. In the period 1891 to 1900 he used it to perform some of the first experiments in wireless power, transmitting radio frequency power across short distances by inductive coupling between coils of wire. In his early 1890s demonstrations such as those before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago he lit light bulbs from across a room. He found he could increase the distance by using a receiving LC circuit tuned to resonance with the Tesla coil's LC circuit, transferring energy by resonant inductive coupling. At his Colorado Springs laboratory during 1899–1900, by using voltages of the order of 10 million volts generated by his enormous magnifying transmitter coil (described below), he was able to light three incandescent lamps at a distance of about . Today the resonant inductive coupling discovered by Tesla is a familiar concept in electronics, widely used in IF transformers and short range wireless power transmission systems such as cellphone charging pads.
It is now understood that inductive and capacitive coupling are "near-field" effects, so they cannot be used for long-distance transmission. However, Tesla was convinced he could develop a long range wireless power transmission system which could transmit power from power plants directly into homes and factories without wires, described in a visionary June 1900 article in "Century Magazine"; "The Problem of Increasing Human Energy". He claimed to be able to transmit power on a "worldwide" scale, using a method that involved conduction through the Earth and atmosphere. Tesla believed that the entire Earth could act as an electrical resonator, and that by driving current pulses into the Earth at its resonant frequency from a grounded Tesla coil with an elevated capacitance, the potential of the Earth could be made to oscillate, creating global standing waves, and this alternating current could be received with a capacitive antenna tuned to resonance with it at any point on Earth. Another of his ideas was that transmitting and receiving terminals could be suspended in the air by balloons at altitude, where the air pressure is lower. At this altitude, he thought, a layer of electrically conductive rarefied air would allow electricity to be sent at high voltages (hundreds of millions of volts) over long distances. Tesla envisioned building a global network of wireless power stations, which he called his "World Wireless System", which would transmit both information and electric power to everyone on Earth. There is no reliable evidence that he ever transmitted significant amounts of power beyond the short range demonstrations above.
Magnifying transmitter.
Tesla's wireless research required increasingly high voltages, and he had reached the limit of the voltages he could generate within the space of his New York lab. Between 1899 and 1900 he built a laboratory in Colorado Springs and performed experiments on wireless transmission there. He chose this location because the polyphase alternating current power distribution system had been introduced there and he had associates who were willing to give him all the power he needed without charging for it. The Colorado Springs laboratory had one of the largest Tesla coils ever built, which Tesla called a "magnifying transmitter" as it was intended to transmit power to a distant receiver. With an input power of 300 kilowatts it could produce potentials of the order of 10 million volts, at frequencies of 50–150 kHz, creating huge "lightning bolts" reportedly up to 135 feet long. During experiments, it caused an overload which destroyed the alternator of the Colorado Springs power company, and Tesla had to rebuild the alternator.
In the magnifying transmitter, Tesla used a modified design ("see circuit") which he had developed in his New York lab in the period 1895–1898, and patented in 1902, different from his previous double-tuned circuits. In addition to the primary ("L1") and secondary ("L2") coils, it had a third coil ("L3") which he called the "extra" coil, not magnetically coupled to the others, attached to the top terminal of the secondary. When driven by the secondary it produced additional high voltage by resonance, being adjusted to resonate with its own parasitic capacitance ("C2") The use of a series-fed resonator coil to generate high voltages was independently discovered by Paul Marie Oudin in 1893 and employed in his Oudin coil.
The Colorado Springs apparatus consisted of a 51-foot-diameter (15.5 m) Tesla transformer composed of a secondary winding ("L2") of 50 turns of heavy wire wound on a 6-foot-high (2 m) circular wooden "fence" around the periphery of the lab, and a single-turn primary ("L1") either mounted on the fence or buried in the ground under it. The primary was connected to a bank of oil capacitors ("C1") to make a tuned circuit, with a rotary spark gap "(SG)", powered by 20 to 40 kilovolts from a powerful utility step-up transformer ("T"). The top of the secondary was connected to the 100-turn 8 ft (2.4 m) diameter "extra" or "resonator" coil "(L3)" in the center of the room. Its high-voltage end was connected to a telescoping 143-foot (43.6 m) "antenna" rod with a 30-inch (1 m) metal ball on top which could project through the roof of the lab. By cranking the rod up or down he could adjust the capacitance in the circuit of the extra coil, tuning it to resonance with the rest of the circuit.
Wardenclyffe tower.
In 1901, convinced his wireless theories were correct, Tesla with financing from banker J. P. Morgan began construction of a high-voltage wireless station, now called the Wardenclyffe Tower, at Shoreham, New York. Although it was built as a transatlantic radiotelegraphy station, Tesla also intended it to transmit electric power without wires as a prototype transmitter for his proposed "World Wireless System". Essentially an enormous Tesla coil, it consisted of a powerhouse with a 400-horsepower generator and a 187-foot (57 m) tower topped by a 68-foot (21 m) diameter metal dome capacitive electrode. The circuit he used was a version of the "magnifying transmitter" he built at Colorado Springs "(above)". Underneath the surface was an elaborate ground system that Tesla said was needed to "grip the earth" to create the oscillating earth currents which he believed would transmit the power.
By 1904 his investors had pulled out and the facility was never completed; it was torn down in 1916. Although Tesla seems to have believed his wireless power ideas were proven, he had a history of making claims that he had not confirmed by experiment, and there seems to be no evidence that he ever transmitted significant power beyond the short-range demonstrations mentioned above. The few reports of long-distance power transmission by Tesla are not from reliable sources. For example, a widely repeated myth is that in 1899 he wirelessly lit 200 light bulbs at a distance of . There is no independent confirmation of this supposed demonstration; Tesla did not mention it, and it does not appear in his laboratory notes. It originated in 1944 from Tesla's first biographer, John J. O'Neill, who said he pieced it together from "fragmentary material... in a number of publications".
In the 100 years since, others such as Robert Golka have built equipment similar to Tesla's, but long-distance power transmission has not been demonstrated, and the scientific consensus is his World Wireless system would not have worked. Contemporary scientists point out that while Tesla's coils (with appropriate antennas) can function as radio transmitters, transmitting energy in the form of radio waves, the frequency he used, around 150 kHz, is far too low for practical long-range power transmission. At these wavelengths the radio waves spread out in all directions and cannot be focused on a distant receiver. Tesla's world power transmission scheme remains today what it was in Tesla's time: a bold, fascinating dream.
Use in radio.
One of the largest applications of the Tesla coil circuit was in early radio transmitters called spark gap transmitters. The first radio wave generators, invented by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, were spark gaps connected directly to antennas, powered by induction coils. Because they lacked a resonant circuit, these transmitters produced highly damped radio waves. As a result, their transmissions occupied an extremely wide bandwidth of frequencies. When multiple transmitters were operating in the same area their frequencies overlapped and they interfered with one another, causing garbled reception. There was no way for a receiver to select one signal over another.
In 1892 William Crookes, a friend of Tesla, had given a lecture on the uses of radio waves in which he suggested using resonance to reduce the bandwidth in transmitters and receivers. By using resonant circuits, different transmitters could be "tuned" to transmit on different frequencies. With narrower bandwidth, separate transmitter frequencies would no longer overlap, so a receiver could receive a particular transmission by "tuning" its resonant circuit to the same frequency as the transmitter. This is the system used in all modern radio.
With an appropriate wire antenna, the Tesla coil circuit could function as such a narrow-bandwidth radio transmitter. In his March 1893 St. Louis lecture, Tesla demonstrated a wireless system that was the first use of tuned circuits in radio, although he used it for wireless power transmission, not radio communication. A grounded spark-excited capacitor-tuned Tesla transformer attached to an elevated wire antenna transmitted radio waves, which were received across the room by a wire antenna attached to a receiver consisting of a second grounded resonant transformer tuned to the transmitter's frequency, which lighted a Geissler tube. This system, patented by Tesla on September 2, 1897, was the first use of the "four-circuit" concept later claimed by Guglielmo Marconi. However, Tesla was mainly interested in wireless power and never developed a practical radio "communication" system. He never believed that radio waves could be used for practical communication, instead clinging to an erroneous theory that radio communication was due to currents in the Earth.
Practical radiotelegraphy communication systems were developed by Marconi beginning in 1895. By 1897 the advantages of narrow-bandwidth (lightly damped) systems noted by Crookes were recognized, and resonant circuits, capacitors and inductors, were incorporated in transmitters and receivers. The "closed primary, open secondary" resonant transformer circuit used by Tesla proved a superior transmitter, because the loosely-coupled transformer partially isolated the oscillating primary circuit from the energy-radiating antenna circuit, reducing the damping, allowing it to produce long "ringing" waves which had a narrower bandwidth. Versions of the circuit were patented by Marconi, John Stone Stone and Oliver Lodge, and were widely used in radio for twenty years. In 1906 Max Wien invented the quenched or "series" spark gap, which extinguished the spark after the energy had been transferred to the secondary, allowing the secondary to oscillate freely after that, reducing damping and bandwidth still more.
Although their damping had been reduced as much as possible, spark transmitters still produced damped waves which had a wide bandwidth, creating interference with other transmitters. Around 1920 they became obsolete, superseded by vacuum tube transmitters which generated continuous waves at a single frequency, which could also be modulated to carry sound. Tesla's resonant transformer continued to be used in vacuum tube transmitters and receivers, and is a key component in radio to this day.
During the "spark era" the radio engineering profession gave credit to Tesla; his circuit became known as the "Tesla coil" or "Tesla transformer". However Tesla did not benefit financially, due to competing patent claims. Marconi had claimed rights to the "closed primary open secondary" transmitter circuit in his controversial 1900 "four circuit" wireless patent. Tesla sued Marconi in 1915 for patent infringement, but didn't have the resources to pursue the action. However, in 1943, in a separate suit brought by the Marconi Company against the US government for use of its patents in World War I, the US Supreme Court invalidated Marconi's 1900 patent claim to the "four circuit" concept. The ruling cited the prior patents of Tesla, Lodge, and Stone, but did not decide which of these parties had rights to the circuit. By that time the issue was moot; the patent had expired in 1915 and spark transmitters had long been obsolete.
Although there is some disagreement over the role Tesla himself played in the invention of radio, sources agree on the importance of his circuit in early radio transmitters. From a modern perspective, most spark transmitters could be regarded as Tesla coils.
Use in medicine.
Tesla had observed as early as 1891 that high frequency currents above 10 kHz did not cause the sensation of electric shock, and in fact currents that would be lethal at lower frequencies could be passed through the body without apparent harm. He experimented on himself, and claimed daily applications of high voltage relieved depression. He was one of the first to observe the heating effect of high frequency currents on the body, the basis of diathermy. During his highly publicized early 1890s demonstrations he passed hundreds of thousands of volts through his body. With characteristic hyperbole he called electricity "the greatest of all doctors" and suggested burying wires under classrooms so its stimulating effect would improve performance of "dull" schoolchildren. Tesla wrote two pioneering papers, in 1891 and 1898 on the medical uses of high frequency currents, but did little further work on the subject.
A few other researchers were also experimentally applying high frequency currents to the body at this time. Elihu Thomson, the co-inventor of the Tesla coil, was one, so in medicine the Tesla coil became known as the "Tesla-Thomson apparatus". In France, from 1889 physician and pioneering biophysicist Jacques d'Arsonval had been documenting the physiological effects of high frequency current on the body, and had made the same discoveries as Tesla. During his 1892 European trip Tesla met with D'Arsonval and was flattered to find they were using similar circuits. D'Arsonval's spark-excited resonant circuits "(above)" did not produce as high voltage as the Tesla transformer. In 1893 French physician Paul Marie Oudin added a "resonator" coil to the D'Arsonval circuit to create the high voltage Oudin coil, a circuit very similar to the Tesla coil, which was widely used for treating patients in Europe.
During this period, people were fascinated by the new technology of electricity, and many believed it had miraculous curative or "vitalizing" powers. Medical ethics were also looser, and doctors could experiment on their patients. By the turn of the century, application of high voltage, "high frequency" currents to the body had become part of a Victorian era medical field, part legitimate experimental medicine and part quack medicine, called "electrotherapy". Manufacturers produced medical apparatus to generate "Tesla currents", "D'Arsonval currents", and "Oudin currents" for physicians. In electrotherapy, a pointed electrode attached to the high voltage terminal of the coil was held near the patient, and the luminous brush discharges from it (called "effluves") were applied to parts of the body to treat a wide variety of medical conditions. In order to apply the electrode directly to the skin, or tissues inside the mouth, anus or vagina, a "vacuum electrode" was used, consisting of a metal electrode sealed inside a partially evacuated glass tube, which produced a dramatic violet glow. The glass wall of the tube and the skin surface formed a capacitor which limited the current to the patient, preventing discomfort. These vacuum electrodes were later manufactured with handheld Tesla coils to make "violet ray" wands, sold to the public as a quack home medical device.
The popularity of electrotherapy peaked after World War I, but by the 1920s authorities began to crack down on fraudulent medical treatments, and electrotherapy largely became obsolete. A part of the field that survived was "diathermy", the application of high frequency current to heat body tissue, pioneered by German physician Karl Nagelschmidt in 1907. During the 1920s "long wave" (0.5~2 MHz) Tesla coil spark diathermy machines were used, in which the current was applied to the body by electrodes. By the 1930s these were being replaced by "short wave" (10~100 MHz) vacuum tube diathermy machines, which had less danger of causing burns, but Tesla coils continued to be used in both diathermy and quack medical devices like violet ray until World War II. In 1926 William T. Bovie discovered that RF currents applied to a scalpel could cut and cauterize tissue in medical operations, and spark oscillators were used as electrosurgery generators or "Bovies" as late as the 1980s.
During the 1920s and 30s all unipolar (single terminal) high voltage medical coils came to be called Oudin coils, so today's unipolar Tesla coils are sometimes referred to as "Oudin coils".
Use in show business.
 
The Tesla coil's spectacular displays of sparks, and the fact that its currents could pass through the human body without causing electric shock, led to its use in the entertainment business.
In the early 20th century it appeared in traveling carnivals, freak shows and circus and carnival sideshows, which often had an act in which a performer would pass high voltages through his body
 Performers such as "Dr. Resisto", "The Human Dynamo", "Electrice", "The Great Volta", and "Madamoiselle Electra" would have their body connected to the high voltage terminal of a hidden Tesla coil, causing sparks to shoot from their fingertips and other parts of their body, and neon lights and fluorescent tube lamps to light up when brought near them. They could also light candles or cigarettes with their fingers. Although they didn't usually cause electric shocks, RF arc discharges from the bare skin could cause painful burns; to prevent them performers sometimes wore metal thimbles on their fingertips "(Rev. Moon, center image above, is using them)". These acts were extremely dangerous and could kill the performer if the Tesla coil was misadjusted. In carny lingo this was called an "electric chair act" because it often included a spark-laced "electrocution" of the performer in an electric chair, exploiting public fascination with this exotic new method of capital punishment, which had become the United States' dominant method of execution around 1900. Today entertainers still perform high voltage acts with Tesla coils, but modern bioelectromagnetics has brought a new awareness of the hazards of Tesla coil currents, and allowing them to pass through the body is today considered extremely dangerous.
Tesla coils were also used as dramatic props in early mystery and science fiction motion pictures, starting in the silent era. The crackling, writhing sparks emanating from the electrode of a giant Tesla coil became Hollywood's iconic symbol of the "mad scientist's" lab, recognized throughout the world. This was probably because the eccentric Nikola Tesla himself, with his famous high voltage demonstrations and his mysterious Colorado Springs laboratory, was one of the main prototypes from which the "mad scientist" stock character originated. Some early films in which Tesla coils appeared were "Wolves of Kultur" (1918), "The Power God" (1926), "Metropolis" (1927), "Frankenstein" (1931) and its many sequels such as "Son of Frankenstein" (1939), "The Mask of Fu Manchu" (1932), "Chandu the Magician" (1932), "The Lost City" (1935), and "The Clutching Hand" (1936) and many later films and television shows. By the 1980s, effects like high voltage sparks were being added to movies by CGI as visual effects in post-production, eliminating the need for dangerous high voltage Tesla coils on sets.
The Tesla coils for many of these movies were constructed by Kenneth Strickfaden (1896-1984) who, beginning with his spectacular effects in the 1931 "Frankenstein", became Hollywood's preeminent electrical special effects expert. His large "Meg Senior" Tesla coil seen in many of these movies consisted of a 6-foot 1000 turn conical secondary and a 10 turn primary, connected to a capacitor through a rotary spark gap, powered by a 20 kV transformer. It could produce 6 foot sparks. Some of his last gigs were the reassembly of the original 1931 "Frankenstein" high voltage apparatus for the Mel Brooks satire "Young Frankenstein" (1974), and construction of a million volt Tesla coil which produced 12 foot sparks for a 1976 stage show by the rock band "Kiss".
Use in education.
Ever since Tesla's 1890s lectures, Tesla coils have been used as attractions in educational exhibits and science fairs. They have become a way to counter the stereotype that science is boring. In the early 20th century, experts like Henry Transtrom and Earle Ovington gave high voltage demonstrations at "electric fairs". High school classes built Tesla coils.
From 1933 into the 1980s, between movie jobs Hollywood special effects expert Ken Strickfaden would take his high voltage apparatus on the road in an exhibition called "Science on Parade" and later "The Kenstric Space Age Science Show" to high schools, colleges, World Fairs and expositions. These spectacular shows, which reached 48 states, had a seminal influence on the birth of the modern "coiling" movement. A number of present-day Tesla hobbyists such as William Wysock say they were inspired to build Tesla coils by seeing Strickfaden's show.
One of the oldest and best-known coils still in operation is the "GPO-1" at Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. It was originally one of a pair of coils built in 1910 by Earle L. Ovington, a friend of Tesla and manufacturer of high voltage electrotherapy apparatus. For a number of years Ovington displayed them at the December electrical trade show at Madison Square Garden in New York City, using them for demonstrations of high voltage science, which Tesla himself sometimes attended. Called the "Million Volt Oscillator", the twin coils were installed on the balcony at the show. Every hour the lights were dimmed and the public was treated to a display of 10 foot arcs. Ovington gave the coils to his friend Dr. Frederick Finch Strong, a leading figure in the alternative health field of electrotherapy. In 1937 Strong donated the coils to the Griffith Observatory. The museum didn't have room to display both, but one coil was restored by Kenneth Strickfaden and has been in daily operation ever since. It consists of a 48 in. (1.2 m) high conical secondary coil topped by a 12 in. (30 cm) diameter copper ball electrode, with a 9-turn spiral primary of 2 in. copper strip, a glass plate capacitor (replacing the original Leyden jars), and rotary spark gap. Its output has been estimated at 1.3 million volts.
Later uses.
In addition to its use in spark-gap radio transmitters and electrotherapy described above, the Tesla coil circuit was also used in the early 20th century in x-ray machines, ozone generators for water purification, and induction heating equipment. However, in the 1920s vacuum tube oscillators replaced it in all these applications. The triode vacuum tube was a much better radio frequency current generator than the noisy, hot, ozone-producing spark, and could produce continuous waves. After this, industrial use of the Tesla coil was mainly limited to a few specialized applications which were suited to its unique characteristics, such as high voltage insulation testing.
In 1926, pioneering accelerator physicists Merle Tuve and Gregory Breit built a 5 million volt Tesla coil as a linear particle accelerator. The bipolar coil consisted of a pyrex tube a meter long wound with 8000 turns of fine wire, with round corona caps on each end, and a 5 turn spiral primary coil surrounding it at the center. It was operated in a tank of insulating oil pressurized to 500 psi which allowed it to reach a potential of 5.2 megavolts. Although it was used for a short period in 1929-30 it was not a success because the particles' acceleration had to be completed within the brief period of a half cycle of the RF voltage.
In 1970 Robert K. Golka built a replica of Tesla's huge Colorado Springs magnifying transmitter in a shed at Wendover Air Force Base, Utah, using data he found in Tesla's lab notes archived at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade, Serbia.
 This was one of the first experiments with the magnifier circuit since Tesla's time. The coil generated 12 million volts. Golka used it to try to duplicate Tesla's reported synthesis of ball lightning.

Christine Shawcroft

Christine Linda Shawcroft (born April 1955) is a British Labour Party activist and former politician.
Shawcroft is a director of Momentum and was elected as the chair of the Labour Party's Disputes Sub-Committee in January 2018. In March 2018, she resigned from her post after she disputed the suspension of a Labour candidate who was accused of Holocaust denial. She later resigned her position on Labour's National Executive Committee.
Early career.
Shawcroft has worked for many years as a teacher in the East End of London. She was elected as a Labour Party member of Tower Hamlets London Borough Council in a 1985 by-election, representing Blackwall, and served for two years as leader of the Labour group on the council, while it was in opposition. She served on the executive of the London Labour Party.
From the mid-1990s, prospective Labour council candidates had to be vetted by a selection panel, and Shawcroft was refused permission to defend her council seat in 1998, Liz Davies claiming that this was due to Shawcroft's left-wing views. She was also rejected as a potential candidate for the London Assembly.
Member of the NEC.
In 1998, Shawcroft stood for the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) as part of the Grassroots Alliance slate. The slate took four out of six seats in the constituency section, but Shawcroft was not elected. The following year, she took second place in the vote and finally gained a place on the NEC. She retained her seat at each subsequent election.
At the 2001 United Kingdom general election, Shawcroft stood in Meriden, taking second place with 39.2% of the vote.
Shawcroft was a leading member of the Labour Representation Committee, a left-wing group within the Labour Party, but resigned in 2012 in protest of it taking control of the "Labour Briefing" journal. With other opponents of this takeover, she became a director of a new "Labour Briefing" publication.
In 2015, Shawcroft was briefly suspended from the Labour Party after she gave support to Lutfur Rahman, the former Mayor of Tower Hamlets.
A supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, and also of Jon Lansman, Shawcroft became a director of Momentum. In January 2018, she was elected as chair of the Labour Party's Disputes Sub-Committee, defeating Ann Black. 
During the process to choose the next general secretary of the Labour Party in March 2018, following the resignation of Iain McNicol, Shawcroft was vocal in her support for Jon Lansman of Momentum over Jennie Formby of the Unite union, a contest which was proving divisive among supporters of Jeremy Corbyn. She commented on Facebook: "Nothing would induce me to support a candidate from a major trade union, they stick it to the rank and file members time after time after time. It’s also time to support disaffiliation of the unions from the Labour Party. The party belongs to us, the members". The comments, which were soon deleted, caused consternation among trade unionists and Momentum distanced itself from Shawcroft's statement.
In February 2019, she decided not to re-stand for the NEC in the election to be held that summer.
At the end of March 2018, after a leak to "The Times", she resigned from the Disputes Sub-Committee after casting doubt on the case for a suspension, offering "partisan disputes in local parties" as an explanation for the dispute. Alan Bull, intended to be a May 2018 council candidate in Peterborough, had in 2015 shared a (faked) article in a closed Facebook group headlined: "International Red Cross Report Confirms the Holocaust of Six Million Jews is a Hoax" accompanied by a photograph of the gates at Auschwitz, to "invite discussion and debate". "I'm not an anti-Semite, I am not a holocaust denier - I support equal rights for Palestinian people," Bull later said. Shawcroft said she was not fully aware of the facts at the time of sending the email and, if she had been, would have reacted differently. A few days later, after seeing the "abhorrent image", she wrote on Facebook that she had told the member that he should be sent for training about antisemitism, and that the issue within the Labour Party was being used to attack Jeremy Corbyn. Bull later removed the post.
On 31 March 2018, Shawcroft issued a further statement in which she indicated that, while "it has been a privilege to serve on the Labour party National Executive Committee for the last 19 years", she was resigning from the body "with immediate effect". She was replaced on the NEC by Eddie Izzard.

Prince George's Enquirer and Southern Maryland Advertiser

The Prince George's Enquirer and Southern Maryland Advertiser was a weekly newspaper published from 1882 to January 30, 1925, in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. It replaced a paper that had been established during the American Civil War by Michael J. Slayman, "The Prince Georgian and Southern Maryland Advertiser". The "Enquirer" was founded by Joseph K. Roberts and Frederick Sasscer, Jr., both politically well-connected lawyers from Upper Marlboro. Roberts died in 1888, but Sasscer continued to edit the paper and eventually became its owner, solidifying the paper's political stance as staunchly Democratic. In 1909, an apprentice working for the paper, Samuel A. Wyvill, became part owner. Together, Sasscer and Wyvill bought the "Marlboro Gazette" from Mary and Charles Wilson on January 30, 1925, and named the new merged paper "The Enquirer-Gazette". Frederick Sasscer remained editor until his death in 1929. "The Enquirer-Gazette" continues to publish issues to this day.
Like other newspapers in Prince George's County, the "Enquirer" paid particular attention to local staple crops such as tobacco, which remained a key market indicator. The "Enquirer" also kept record of local social events such as gatherings of antebellum families that featured anachronistic displays like jousting. Around the turn of the 20th century, William Woodward Sr.'s purchase of Belair Mansion and subsequent establishment of a thoroughbred race horse breeding and training operation became a popular subject for local papers – including the "Enquirer" and "Enquirer-Gazette".

Lewis H. Stanton House

The Lewis H. Stanton House, nicknamed "The Chimneys", is a historic house in Morris, Minnesota, United States, built in 1881. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for having local significance in the theme of architecture. It was nominated for its Stick–Eastlake architecture and prominence among the housing stock of Morris.
History.
Lewis H. Stanton (1860–1938) was the son of Edwin Stanton, who served in Cabinet-level positions with presidents James Buchanan, Abraham Lincoln, and Andrew Johnson. The younger Stanton moved from Washington D.C. to Minnesota for health reasons, and had this house constructed for himself by a former East Coast schoolmate. Stanton left Morris around 1890, moving with his family to New Orleans, where he spent the rest of his life.

Fred A. Henderich

Fred A Henderich (1879 – 1941) was a leading architect of the Florida land boom of the 1920s. He was a native of New York and graduated from Columbia University. Henderich came to Saint Augustine in 1905 to work for Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Hotel Company and lived and worked in the city for over twenty years.
Buildings.
Henderich designed multiple bungalow style homes in Saint Augustine — many on Saint George Street south of Saint Francis, where his father-in-law developed a large tract of land. These homes exhibited native wood shingles, palm tree porch posts, and coquina stone fireplaces.
Houses include:
Henderich also took advantage of the area's natural resources to bring the Mediterranean Revival style to Florida in civic architecture. After the original Flagler Hospital was destroyed by fire in 1916, Mary Lily Kenan (the widow of Henry Flagler) and the hospital's ladies auxiliary raised funds toward construction of a new building. The new Flagler Hospital opened in 1921, designed by Henderich with a stucco shell dash exterior and a red tile roof.
In 1925, Henderich designed a masonry structure at 120 Martin Luther King Ave (then Central Avenue) which served as Saint Augustine's first public high school for African-Americans. The Colored School was renamed Excelsior in 1928 and served as Lincolnville's community center for over forty years. It was retired as a high school in 1968 and reopened as the Excelsior Museum and Cultural Center in 2005.
Henderich's major Florida buildings include:

Naomi Kobayashi

 and is a Japanese textiles, paper, installation and sculpture artist.
Early life and education.
Naomi Kobayashi was born in Tokyo, Japan, and lives in Kyoto, Japan. She studied textiles, printing and weaving at Musashino Art University. She graduated in 1969. She was married to the late Masakazu Kobayashi, with whom she collaborated.
Career.
Early work.
Kobayashi started out as a weaver but became entranced by thread, by the paradox that she described as "so gentle" and "so strong". For the next fifteen years she explored the soft yet strong paradox in wall reliefs and sculptures. This involved using her own off-loom technique where she glued strands of yarn next to each other on a board creating a ribbed texture. On top of this she placed layers of fibre in parallel to this texture, which she built up to create a three-dimensional profile. These pieces dealt with the linearity of fibre, while introducing the element of volume
Later work.
In 1987 Kobayashi made a shift in her practice, using the same technique of building up using glue; she created a free-hanging ring. While her early work focused on solids, these later works focused on voids. While her early work stayed in her thematic red and what, the later work has shifted some, including pink, which she said was white reflecting red. The scale of many of these pieces is monumental, as she received many architectural commissions during this period
Themes.
Formal contrasts are at the core of Kobayashi's work; the relationship of horizontal to vertical, of soft to solid straight to curved and ying to yang. For Kobayashi, the properties of her materials convey metaphysical messages. The cosmos and nature are themes She deals with, as well as "singing" with thread

1955 European Rowing Championships (men)

The 1955 European Rowing Championships for men were rowing championships held in the Belgian city of Ghent. The venue was the Watersportbaan, which was built for these championships and was part of Belgium's preparation for their bid to host the 1960 Summer Olympics. The competition for women had been held earlier in the month in Bucharest. The event in Ghent was held from 25 to 28 August and they competed in all seven Olympic boat classes (M1x, M2x, M2-, M2+, M4-, M4+, M8+). Some 400 competitors form 21 countries competed.
German participation.
The National Olympic Committee of the GDR was granted provisional membership in 1955 and as a next step, East Germany tried to gain membership of the individual sporting organisations that participated in Olympic disciplines. In July 1955, the East German rowing association applied for a license from FISA, the International Rowing Federation, to be able to nominate their rowers at the European Championships in Bucharest (women) and Ghent (men). FISA's response was that the next congress, to be held just prior to the championships in Ghent, will decide on the matter. Therefore, East German teams could not compete in 1955. At the congress, East Germany was unanimously accepted as a new member.
West Germany was represented in Ghent in six boat classes.

Malagasy weaving

Malagasy weaving flourished until around 1950. Due to varied ecology in Madagascar, many different materials were used to weave with and formed various styles of mainly striped cloth.
Cultural impact.
Textiles were an essential part Malagasy social and ethnic identity. Some types of cloth were imbued with supernatural powers. The Sakalava, Mahafaly, and Merina were three Malagasy cultures for which textiles played an important role in statecraft and metaphysical belief systems. Malagasy weaving was associated with women and the female identity. The relationships between weaving, the ancestors, and reburial are issues that reflect a dynamic world of 
spiritual power, social importance, and symbolism. A Madagascar-wise tale stated that the original union of a man and a woman, the wife brought the cloth and a mat, while the husband provided house building and agriculture. Hence, traditionally, a women's domestic skills, intelligence and industry were judged largely on her weaving.
Lamba.
Traditionally the primary article of clothing woven by Malagasy women was the lamba. Lamba is the term that the highlanders used, other colloquial names exist). It was created by sewing together two pieces to form a rectangle measuring around 2 m x 2.5 m. Warp created stripes adorned this cloth, with the stripes running around the waist horizontally. The "Lamba" was worn differently depending on the emotional and physical needs of the wearer to: protect from cold, hide timidity, show action and determination, or indicate mourning. It also served as a: blanket, apron, scarf, belt, bedding, turban, kitchen cloth, bag/ suitcase, tent/ shelter, awning, baby carrier or cradle.
The Five Zones.
The differences in weaving can largely be divided by weaving materials, which were indigenous to different areas and create five different weaving zone or areas. Only in one part of the areas, in the central highlands was frequent trading to acquire different materials common.
The East and West Coast.
Raffia was the staple fibre of these peoples of this region who in present times are made up of the: Sihanaka, Tsimihety, Antakarana, northern Sakalava, and the Betsimisaraka. Different groups made different lengths and sizes of raffia garments, all of which were good in the rain, mud and constant humidity of the area
The Southeast.
"Voara" family of trees beaten bark, once used by most of the island by the 19th century was considered the specialty of the southeast, along with "Harefo" reeds that were plaited not woven on looms. The Tanala, Antemoro people, Antambahoaka, Tefasy, Tesaka, eastern Bara people and eastern Betsileo people are the current day residents of these lands
The Southeast Hinterland.
The spun bark associated the southeast could be made soft and as shimmery as silk. The "Hofotra" (Abutilon angulatum) species, particularly the Hafo-potsy variety, was used by the Zafimaniry and the eastern Betsileo people. This material was long process that included: fire drying the inner bark, several sessions of hours boiling bark, washing, sun drying, splitting it, tying it end to end, twisting it by rolling on the thigh, weaving it on a back strap loom and beating finished product to make it softer and shinier.
The South and West.
In the arid South and West of madagascar, cotton, the prime clothing material, and wild silk were the two main fibres. This area is the home of the Bara people, southern Sakalava people, Vezo people, Masikoro, Mahafaly, Tandroy and western Tanosy. The Malagasy define silk by the type of leaves the silk worms eat, which here was the "Afiafy" and "pisopiso" trees and well as the most coveted, the "tapia", in the Isalo region of Bara's territory.
The Central Highlands.
The historic home of the Betsileo was indigenous to three types of fibre: Hemp, Banana stem fibre and wild silk of the "Tapia" trees, however these fibres were of limited distribution. This area used trade to overcome their lack and emerged as one of the most important textile production centres of Madagascar. Through trade and eventually introduction to the local area, mulberry silk emerged as one of the prominent materials of this region along with non-indigenous cotton and pigeon pea silk. The Merina had no indigenous fiber in their area and its inhabitants were prone to famine, so monarchs made it a political strategy to develop trades, particularly weaving in the area. 
Cocoons collected from the wild silkworm were unraveled than woven into valuable textiles called lambda mena, meaning “red silk' in the Merina kingdom. The name is a misnomer, referring to their "red" status that recalled royal prestige and ancestral authority, which in the Merina associated with the color red. These cloths were woven in many different color and pattern combinations. Worn by the aristocracy in life, these "red" textiles were also a focal point of burial, exhumation, and reburial ceremonies designed to free the dead person’s spirit from earthly death and decay.

Statue of Queen Victoria, Weymouth

Queen Victoria Statue is a statue of Queen Victoria, located at Weymouth, Dorset in England. Designed by George Blackall Simonds, the statue was erected to commemorate the Queen's reign. It features a life-size bronze figure of the Queen on a podium made from Portland stone by Messrs. Singer, of Frome. The Mayor of Weymouth, Mr. John Bagg, organised the collection of funds for the statue, which was unveiled by Princess Henry of Battenberg on 20 October 1902.
The statue has been a Grade II listed monument since 1997. Historic England recorded that the statue was in a "good position at the north entry to the town, but is less favourably placed than the corresponding King's Statue at the south end of the Esplanade". Plans for the statue's restoration were announced in 2007 and carried out in 2009 by Osirion Building Conservation.

Philip Kearny (Brown)

Philip Kearny is an 1888 bronze sculpture of Philip Kearny by Henry Kirke Brown, installed in the United States Capitol, in Washington, D.C., as part of the National Statuary Hall Collection. It is one of two statues donated by the state of New Jersey.
Description and history.
The statue portrays Kearny dressed in the uniform of a Civil War general, holding a sword in his right hand. His coat draped over his left shoulder covers the fact that his left arn had been amputated following the Battle of Churubusco.
Kearny, described by William Walter Phelps while accepting the statue into the collection on August 21, 1888, called Kearny "the perfect soldier . . .brave as a lion, tender as a woman."
Although the statue entered the Hall in 1888 it is dated "1873" on the base.
There are at least three other casting of the statue. one was done in 1901 and is located in Kearny Park, Muskegon, Michigan. Another was dedicated in 1880 in Trenton, New Jersey and then relocated several times, finally to Military Park in Newark, New Jersey. The Archives of American Art traced the some what complicated history of the statue. "In March 1868, the New Jersey legislature approved funding for a bronze portrait of Major General Philip Kearny to be placed in Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol. The cast was finished in 1873, but on its way to Washington, the statue was diverted to the State House in Trenton where it ended up in an obscure hallway. In 1880, the mistake was discovered and concerned citizens of Newark petitioned to relocate the sculpture to its original destination in Statuary Hall, and if not there, then to a suitable location in Newark where Kearney was born and raised. The petition was successful and in 1880, the statue was installed to Newark's Military Park on a Quincy granite base designed by Henry Kirke Brown and architect Paul G. Botticher to resemble an embankment in a war fortification." In that same year the statue accepted into the Statuary Hall in Washington, D.C. The statue had somehow become two.
In 1993, the Newark statue was knocked of its base and in the process of restoring it a cast was taken and another version of the work was created, this one placed in Kearny, New Jersey, a town named after the general and dedicated on September 10, 1993.
A bill to replace the statue with one of suffragist Alice Paul passed the state Senate on February 10, 2020.

<doc id="56714713" url="?curid=56714713" title="G-12 (Brazilian football)">
G-12 (Brazilian football)

In Brazilian football, G-12 (Big Twelve) refers to a group of twelve clubs: Atlético Mineiro, Botafogo, Corinthians, Cruzeiro, Flamengo, Fluminense, Grêmio, Internacional, Palmeiras, Santos, São Paulo and Vasco da Gama. They are considered to be the most popular and successful sides in Brazilian football, having won all but six editions of the Brasileirão between them since the inception of the tournament.
Honours and popularity.
Their status as major clubs in Brazilian football stems from their historical performances at their respective state leagues. For a long time, there were no national tournaments in Brazil (with the first edition of the Brasileirão being only held in 1959) and competition between teams from different states was sparse (with the Torneio Rio-São Paulo, held irregularly between 1933 and 1966 and then from 1993 to 2002, being the most notable tournament of this nature); thus, these clubs first earned their distinguished reputation for being dominant within state borders.
This regional success translated into national and international glory. The Big Twelve clubs have dominated the Brasileirão and the Copa do Brasil and put up great performances at the Copa Libertadores and the Club World Cup (and other equivalent world tournaments).
The Big Twelve are also the most supported clubs in Brazil, enjoying nationwide popularity. Even away from state borders, it is not hard to find supporters of Big Twelve clubs., often surpassing even local clubs.
Controversies.
The validity of the concept of a Big Twelve is often topic of debate. It is at times portrayed as a rigid construct that excludes teams that merit a place in this group and at other times it is argued to be an outdated definition that includes clubs whose place is no longer merited.
The case for more teams.
Esporte Clube Bahia.
Bahia hails from Salvador, Bahia and is one of the two major clubs from the Campeonato Baiano (the other being Vitória). It is the only non-Big Twelve club to have two Brasileirão titles to its name (tied with Grêmio and Botafogo and surpassing Atlético Mineiro), notably beating Pelé and "Os Santásticos" in the final of the 1959 edition. Numerable speaking, its supporters compete with those of Fluminense and Botafogo and are ahead of any non-Big Twelve ones. It is, in fact, one of the Clube dos 13's founding members alongside the Big Twelve. Prior its first relegation in 1997, Bahia was considered one of the biggests clubs in Brazil. However, its Brasileirão campaigns have been generally unimpressive since the 1980s, and the club spent much of the 2000s outside the first division.
Bahia was relegated in 1997 to the Campeonato Brasileiro Serie B and only come back to the top tier of Brazilian football in 2000 with a political maneuver, after cbf's withdrawal from organizing the championship of that year due to legal problems and handing it to Clube dos 13, because the club failed in achieve the promotion to Serie A in 1998 and 1999. Bahia was again relegated to Serie B in 2003 and relegated to Serie C in 2005, the low-point in the history of the club. The team disputed two seasons of Serie C until achieve its first promotion in history in 2007 to the Serie B, and in 2010 the team was promoted for the first time to the Brasileirão. Bahia was relegated in 2014 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, but this time they only became two seasons out of Série A and made the comeback in the 2017 edition
The club also lags behind Big Twelve clubs in financial assets.
Paraná State.
From Curitiba one of the main clubs in the city are Coritiba Foot Ball Club and Club Athletico Paranaense and the league this state is the Campeonato Paranaense. Athletico Paranaense is often regarded as one of the best-run clubs in Brazil, with financial results that rival those of the Big Twelve. The club has won the Brasileirão once, in 2001, and its best campaign at the Copa Libertadores was a runner-up showing in 2005. However, the club has a very poor pre-1990s record at the Brasileirão and its fanbase is relatively small compared to Big Twelve clubs and very much contained within Paraná's borders. Coritiba won one title of Brasileirão, conquered in 1985 and it was the first club of Paraná to participate Copa Libertadores, in 1986, 
as well as the first club to carry an expression title in its state. The club is known for having the biggest fanbase
in the state. Athletico Paranaense also won the titles of Copa do Brasil, which neither the G12 clubs Botafogo and São Paulo won, and also Copa Sudamericana (or another of its predecessors), which Fluminense did not win.
Other clubs.
Like the Big Twelve and Bahia, Coritiba and Athletico Paranaense, the teams Guarani, Portuguesa, Goiás, Sport and Vitória were also members of the Clube dos 13, that were composed by the most important and traditional on that period. But each one of them had issues after that.
Guarani, the 1978 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A champion and Sport Club do Recife and the 1987 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A champion, are the other Campeonato Brasileiro Série A champions outside the Big Twelve. They both struggles with financial problems, and Sport has the worst financial situation between all clubs that plays in Campeonato Brasileiro Série A this year.
Goiás and Vitória spent mostly of previous seasons on the second division, but achieved good things on the last years. Goiás was the 2010 Copa Sudamericana runner-up, and Vitoria was the 1993 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A and 2010 Copa do Brasil runner-up.
After the "Héverton Case", that made the team been relegated to the second division, the Portuguesa was relegated more two times straight, and now do not compete any national championship, been on Campeonato Paulista Série A2.
During the early 2000's, São Caetano got noticed in both national and international media after being a finalist of 2002 Copa Libertadores, the most important tournament in South America. They lost to Olimpia of Paraguay on penalties.
After the Red Bull took over the control of the 1991 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A runner-up, Clube Atlético Bragantino, and changed its name to Red Bull Bragantino. The club claims that it will be one of Brazil's best clubs in the future.
The case for less teams.
It is often argued if there is too big a gap even between Big Twelve clubs in honours (outside of state leagues) and fanbase size. Flamengo and Corinthians could be argued to be in a tier of their own in terms of supporters, far above third place São Paulo, but this supposed superiority does not translate into the pitch, with many teams claiming more titles than them in the Brasileirão, Copa do Brasil, Copa Libertadores, and Club World Cup. Similarly, it's sometimes argued if Santos, Fluminense and Botafogo are below their regional rivals (Corinthians, São Paulo and Palmeiras all boast significantly more supporters than Santos; Flamengo and Vasco da Gama lay claim to more international success than Fluminense and Botafogo). However, these three clubs' importance to Brazilian football cannot be understated: Santos's "Os Santásticos" was the most dominant Brazilian side ever, winning six Brasileirão and eight Campeonato Paulista titles in the 1960s; Botafogo hold the record for most capped players for the Brazil national football team in World Cups; and Fluminense introduced the sport to Rio de Janeiro, being the oldest active club in Rio, with the birth of the Brazil national football team happening on its grounds in a friendly against Exeter City.

Missionaries of Christ Jesus

The Missionaries of Christ Jesus are a Catholic religious institute founded in Javier, Spain in 1944. Members use the post-nominal letters MCJ.
History.
The congregation was founded in Javier, Spain on 14 March 1944 by María Camino Sanz Orrio and was canonically formalized by Marcelino Olaechea Loizaga, bishop of Pamplona, in a decree on 5 June 1946.
Orrio was President of Catholic Action during the Spanish Civil War.
Orrio sought total renunciation and sacrifice for herself, and imagined that the new order would be a difficult way of life in mission to serve to the poorest, the abandoned, and the sick.
The sisters follow the Ignatian spirituality.
The congregation sought to be a more agile and effective style of missionaries. They sought to be women of faith and prayer, anchored in the essentials: the love of Jesus Christ and the consecration to the Mission. In order preserve this consecration, members of the order take a fourth vow to "march and serve the missions". However, this vow was suppressed in 1969. Everything they do as an order is expected to be in service to this ideal. The order sought to have minimal structures, schedules, and standards in order to maximize availability for service and prompt response to the most urgent needs.
The first sisters were the founder Maria Camino Sanz Orrio, Maria Concepción Arraiza Jáuregui and Maria Teresa Unzu Lapeira. Eugenia Nagore Nuin joined them just a few months later.
On 30 March 1944, the Institute was constituted in Pia Unión, with the name of Missionaries of Christ Jesus. On 5 June 1946, it became a religious Congregation of Diocesan Law. On 3 October 1946, the first four Missionaries of Christ Jesus pronounced their vows.
The first members had initially planned to go to Japan, but instead the first group departed to India on 18 November 1948. This group consisted of Maria Camino Sanz Orrio, Guadalupe Velasco, Pilar Gonzalez, Maria del Villar and Margarita. Five sisters went to two mission posts at Kohima and Tura. At that time there were already 50 missionaries. In November 1951, two other sisters began a mission in Japan. In 1954 the first two Japanese members of the order began their formation.
On 27 June 1954 the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith elevated the Missionaries of Christ Jesus to the status of an Institute of Pontifical Law.

Harriette Bailey Conn

Harriette Bailey Conn (September 22, 1922 – August 21, 1981) was an American lawyer and politician. A civil rights activist who became known for her efforts assist minorities, women, and defendants in Indiana's criminal justice system, Conn became the first woman and the first African American to serve as Indiana's state public defender in 1970. She also served as Indianapolis' assistant city attorney from 1968 to 1970, and twice won election to the Indiana House of Representatives (representing Marion County, Indiana (Indianapolis)) as a Republican until she resigned her legislative seat to become the state public defender.
Education and family.
Harriette Vesta Bailey was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on September 22, 1922. She was the second child of Nelle Vesta (Hayes) and Robert L. Bailey. Her father served as an Indiana deputy attorney general from 1930 to 1932 and was a prominent civil rights lawyer in the state and involved in the early efforts of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
Bailey attended Indianapolis Public Schools and graduated from Crispus Attucks High School(then the only high school serving the African American community) in 1937 at the age of fourteen. She then enrolled at Talladega College in Alabama, where she majored in English and speech. Before graduating in 1941, Bailey became a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority and the first woman president of the school's Little Theater.
Bailey returned to Indianapolis after graduation and married Clifton F. Conn Sr. While raising a family of seven children (two daughters and five sons), she enrolled in law school, graduating from the Indiana University School of Law in 1955. The Conns divorced in 1961.
Career.
Conn was admitted to the Indiana Bar in 1955. Her early career included a year (1955–56) as a deputy attorney general in Indiana. There she worked with or represented state units including the Indiana Civil Rights Commission, the Indiana State Teachers' Retirement Fund, and the Indiana Public Employees Retirement Fund. In addition, Conn briefly worked for the Indiana State Highway Department.
In February 1965, Conn joined Marie T. Lauck and Jane Hunt Davis to form a private law practice in Indianapolis. Later that year Conn began serving as a Marion County, Indiana, deputy prosecuting attorney in the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit. Because state laws prohibited a state employee from serving as a state legislator, Conn had to resign from her position as deputy prosecuting attorney after winning election to the state House of Representatives in 1966.
State legislator.
A Republican, Conn twice won elections as state representative from Marion County (in the multi-member 26th district) to the Indiana General Assembly. Republicans swept Indianapolis' fifteen seats from Democratic control in 1966, and Conn won re-election in 1968. During the 95th and 96th sessions of the state legislature, Conn became chairperson of the Indiana Welfare and Social Security Committee, as well as a member of the state's Constitutional Revision Commission and the Judiciary Committee. Conn introduced a bill advocating abortion reform, which passed the Indiana House of Representatives and a modified version passed the Indiana Senate, but Indiana governor Roger D. Branigin vetoed the legislation. Conn also introduced a bill that expanded women's property rights that became law in 1967 and sponsored bills related to civil rights, aid to dependent children, and private slum clearance.
Civic attorney and public defender.
In 1968, while still serving as a state representative, Conn became an assistant city attorney for Indianapolis under Richard Lugar's mayoral administration and remained in that position until 1970. As an assistant city attorney, Conn served as legal council to the Indianapolis City-County Council and an advisor to the Indianapolis Human Rights Commission. She later served as chairman of the Indiana Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.
Effective May 1, 1970, Conn was appointed as a public defender for the State of Indiana, becoming the first woman and first African American to hold the position. The public defender's office provided legal services to Indiana inmates who were unable to afford private legal council to appeal their convictions and sentences. As a result of the appointment, Conn was admitted to the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States. Conn also made an unsuccessful bid for Marion County municipal court judge in 1974, but she was defeated in the primary and remained a public defender until her death in 1981. In addition to her duties as a public defender, Conn served as the office's chief administrative officer at a time when the office's heavy caseload caused the staff to increase from three in 1970 to twenty-seven in 1981.
Community leader.
Conn was a leader in civic affairs, which included membership in numerous professional and political organizations such as the American Bar Association, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Marion County Bar Association, and Indianapolis Bar Association, where she was among its first black members. Conn was also a member of the Republican National Committee, Indiana Women Lawyers Association, the Indianapolis Lawyers Commission, Indianapolis Urban League and Indianapolis Women's Political Caucus, among others.
In addition, Conn was involved in civil rights groups, including a life member of the NAACP and chairperson of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and the Indiana State Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, as well as the Indianapolis Urban League, Citizens Forum, and the Indianapolis Senior Citizens Center, among other civic organizations. Conn also remained active in the Talladega College Alumni Association, as a member of the advisory board at Vincennes University, and the Chi chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority in Indianapolis, where she served as its president in 1963.
Death and legacy.
Conn died unexpectedly of a heart attack on August 21, 1981, at the age of fifty-eight. She is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis. The Indiana Historical Society in Indianapolis holds her papers.

Lorenzo Carter (American football)

Lorenzo Lemuel Carter (born December 10, 1995) is an American football linebacker for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Georgia.
High school career.
Carter attended and played high school football at Norcross High School. He was named to the USA Today All-USA high school football team after his senior year in 2013.
College career.
Carter attended and played college football at Georgia under head coaches Mark Richt and Kirby Smart. As a true freshman at Georgia, Carter played 13 games making 5 starts, and received the University of Georgia newcomer of the year award. After the 2016 season, Carter announced that he would return to school for his senior season, despite speculation that he might declare for the 2017 NFL draft.
Professional career.
Carter attended the NFL Scouting Combine and completed the majority of drills, but opted to skip the bench press, short shuttle, and three-cone drill.

The New York Giants selected Carter in the third round (66th overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft. Carter was the eighth linebacker drafted in 2018.
On May 10, 2018, the New York Giants signed Carter to a four-year, $4.08 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $1.04 million. In Week 3, against the Houston Texans, Carter recorded his first professional sack.

1896 United States presidential election in Idaho

The 1896 United States presidential election in Idaho took place on November 3, 1896. All contemporary 45 states were part of the 1896 United States presidential election. State voters chose three electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
Background.
Idaho, upon its organization as a territory was overwhelmingly Democratic, but had been increasingly dominated by the Republican Party in the years leading up to statehood, as ex-Southern and Mormon mining settlers were increasingly outweighed by those from the Midwest. The state Democratic Party would regroup and its pro-silver, anti-Mormon faction under Marshal Fred T. Dubois would bring the state into the Union in the late 1880s.
Upon statehood, Idaho was shaken by a wave of strikes in the silver-mining regions and even deeper conflict whereby an idled ore concentrator was destroyed in Gem. This, alongside opposition to Republican Governor Norman Bushnell Willey’s declaration of martial law upon the miners, and against the absentee ownership of Idaho's land and water, would turn the state's electorate strongly towards the Populist leader James B. Weaver, who carried the state in 1892 in an election where Gold Democrat and former President Grover Cleveland was not even on the ballot.
As the 1896 election approached, it was clear that silver politics would be the determining factor in Idaho's vote, and that the state would not vote for any candidate opposing free silver. Senator Fred T. Dubois, who had been a critical player in giving Idaho statehood, confirmed this in June. When William Jennings Bryan gained the Democratic nomination on a platform favouring the coinage of silver at 16:1 relative to gold, the Populist Party supported him throughout the country.
Vote.
Idaho was won by the Democratic/Populist nominees, William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska and his running mate Arthur Sewall of Maine. Bryan won every county, and only in three of twenty-one did McKinley crack a quarter of the vote. Despite half a century of overwhelming Republican dominance, no presidential nominee has equalled Bryan's performance in the state.
Bryan would later defeat McKinley again in Idaho four year later but would later lose the state to William Howard Taft in 1908.

<doc id="56714963" url="?curid=56714963" title="Tora (Darfur)">
Tora (Darfur)

The Tora are a semi-legendary culture that existed in Jebel Marra, Darfur. In local oral traditions they appear as "white giants" who arrived in Darfur from somewhere in the north, which might be a hint to them originally being Berbers. They are credited with the introduction of monumental stone architecture, advanced stone-working techniques and agriculture techniques like terrace farming, irrigation and palm tree cultivation. By the 12th century the Tora culture had been succeeded by the Daju.
Architecture.
While it is unknown if the Tora even existed, the pre-Daju sites ascribed to them are real. The construction methods employed appear to be a local development, different from the architecture of the Chad and Nile region, but still fundamentally African in character. Typical for Tora architecture is the massive masonry which is faced on both sides. Rubble was used to fill the walls, making the structures extremely solid. The largest type of structure are palaces, being as large as 200-400m in diameter. They normally consist of stone huts encircled by a wall and were built on hill-tops. The wall could be divided or coupled to present two separate compounds, with two entrances opposite each other. This probably served to separate males from females.
The Tora architecture was adopted by the succeeding Daju kingdom and remained in use in modified form during the rule of the Tunjur and early Keira sultans, but had been replaced by new construction methods including fired bricks by 1700.

Anne Gillespie Shaw

Annie "Anne" Gillespie Shaw CBE (28 May 1904 – 4 February 1982) was a Scottish engineer and businesswoman. Shaw specialised in time and motion study. She began her own consulting company, the Anne Shaw Organisation Ltd., in 1945.
Life and career.
Shaw was born in Uddingston, Scotland, on 28 May 1904 to David Perston Shaw and Helen Brown Shaw MBE who became MP for Bothwell in 1931. She attended St Leonard's School in St Andrews and Laurel Bank School in Glasgow. She went on to study at the University of Edinburgh before studying for her postgraduate certificate at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.
Shaw met Dr Lillian Gilbreth at Bryn Mawr College and became Gilbreth's research assistant in the field of Motion Study. Shaw then began working at Gilbreth, Inc. until 1930 when she returned to the UK.
She became a personnel officer at Metropolitan-Vickers before becoming chief supervisor of women workers in 1933 and was the company's chief motion-study investigator between 1930 and 1945. She was also a consultant to the Associated Electrical Industries group of which Metropolitan-Vickers was a part.
Shaw joined the Women's Engineering Society in 1935, and during the thirteenth annual conference of the Women's Engineering Society, Shaw gave a presentation on her study of motion at the Science Museum in Kensington, London. In late 1936, Shaw helped produce a film for the Electrical Association for Women which demonstrated the application of motion study concerning food preparation in the home. On 31 May 1937, she was selected by the National Institute of Industrial Psychology to lecture on modern developments in the study of time and motion.
On 26 November 1937, at the Metropolitan-Vickers Debating Society, Shaw served as an opponent of a motion "That the Introduction of Female Apprentices to these works is to be deplored". As a result of her opposing voice, alongside those of Gertrude Entwisle, Dorothy Smith, and the speech of Dorothy Garfitt, a recently accepted apprentice, the motion lost by a margin of 17 votes.
Shaw married John H. Pirie in 1937 and they had three children. To continue working at Metropolitan-Vickers as a married woman, and to ensure the continued employment of her colleague Margery Havelock after her wedding in 1937, Shaw persuaded the Company Board in 1938 to remove its marriage bar.
Shaw was recruited by the Minister of Aircraft Production, Stafford Cripps, in 1942 and during World War II, she worked on the Production Efficiency Board as an adviser to the aircraft industry.
In 1945, Shaw started the Anne Shaw Organisation Ltd. of which she was the chairman and managing director until 1975. Between 1964 and 1979, she was also the director of Wescot Ltd.
Death and legacy.
In the 1954 New Year Honours she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services in the field of personnel management.
Shaw died on 4 February 1982 in Macclesfield, Cheshire, aged 77.
In 2017, Shaw was inducted into the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame.
Publications.
She published “An Introduction to the Theory and Application of Motion Study" in 1944, "The Full Application of Motion Study" in 1950, and "The Purpose and Practice of Motion Study" in 1952.

Gerard Leckie

Gerard Leckie (6 March 1943 – 8 December 1982) was a Surinamese scientist, teacher and dean at the University of Suriname. He was one of the victims of the December murders.
Biography.
Leckie taught, was dean of the socio-economic faculty, but was also chairman of the Association for Scientific Personnel at the University of Suriname (VWPU). He studied psychology and was subsequently promoted at the University of Nijmegen.
On 24 November 1982, the Association for Democracy was founded, as a direct result of the announcement of reform plans by Dési Bouterse, which he unveiled in a speech on 15 November 1982. It consisted of people who wanted to commit themselves to the return of democracy in Suriname. Trade union actions and student demonstrations were organized, and in Paramaribo there was great unrest. The strike actions were a thorn in the eyes of Bouterse and his Group of Sixteen sergeants, who assumed that the actions were deliberately organized to cause unrest. The military saw Leckie as the instigator of the student protests; therefore he was placed on a list of opponents to be killed.
On 8 December 1982, on the personal order of Bouterse, Leckie was captured by the military, brought to prison in Fort Zeelandia, where he, after cruel torturing, was murdered, becoming one of the fifteen victims being killed by the military that day. On December 13, he was buried at the Roman Catholic cemetery in Paramaribo, next to co-victim Jozef Slagveer. According to eyewitness accounts, he had bruises in his face and a bullet hole in his chest. When the graves of the victims were opened for forensic investigation in 2002, the grave of Leckie was opened first.

L. B. C. Cunningham

Dr Leslie Bennet Craigie Cunningham FRSE OBE (1895–31 August 1946) was a 20th-century Scottish statistician and physicist known for his expertise on air armaments. In 1936 he invented the gyro gunsight (GGS) which compensates for the movement of target aircraft, predicting their position dependent upon their speed. This created an effective increase in successful targeting from 100 to 400%
Life.
Cunningham was born in Edinburgh in 1895, the son of Jean Craigie and her husband William Cunningham. The family lived at 14 Ramsay Gardens at the top of the Royal Mile in Edinburgh.
He was educated at Edinburgh Academy, then from 1906 attended Sedbergh School in Yorkshire. He returned to Edinburgh to study at the University of Edinburgh but his education was interrupted by World War I. He served in the King's Own Scottish Borderers then the Royal Engineers. He had the rank of 2nd Lieutenant. In May 1916 he was promoted to Lieutenant.
After the war he returned to the University of Edinburgh, and in 1923 graduated with an MA BSc Mathematics and Physics. He continued at the University, gaining a PhD with a thesis on the "Trajectory of Falling Bombs". In 1925 he began working for the RAF as an Education Officer. In 1931 he introduced the world's first course on Advanced Air Armaments. In 1936, whilst at the Royal Aircraft Establishment he patented the Gyro gunsight, produced by Ferranti and immediately used by both the RAF and USAF. He also worked on position-finding equipment based on mathematical predictions (a precursor to radar).
In the World War II he was Superintendent of Air Warfare Analysis. In 1941 his gunsight was brought into active use in the Spitfire. He was given the rank of Honorary Squadron Leader.
In 1945 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Edmund Taylor Whittaker, Edward Copson, David Gibb and Alexander Aitken.
He died at 49 Beverley Gardens in Stanmore near Harrow on 31 August 1946 aged 51. He is buried with his parents in New Calton Burial Ground in Edinburgh just south of the main east-west entrance path.

Liu Tongxun

Liu Tongxun (; 1698–1773) was a politician in Qing dynasty. He was one of relatively few ethnically Han Grand Secretariat of the Qianlong Emperor's reign. He has served for the Qing government for more than 40 years with integrity, and dares to direct advice to the emperor, has made remarkable achievements in official administration, military affairs and river conservancy.
Life.
Liu Tongxun was born in a scholarly family and got a good education since childhood. His father Liu Jie received Jinshi degree in Kangxi Emperor’s period, served as provincial administrator, then later promoted to lieutenant governor in Sichuan. And his grandfather Liu Bixian also gained Jinshi degree in Shunzhi Emperor's period. Liu Tongxun was studying hard enough, and obtain Jinshi degree in 1724. Sooner, he started his career in Hanlin Academy (Chinese: 翰林院). Later on, he risen through the central administration. He died in 1773 due to overwork, at the age of 76.
Achievements.
Investigate Malfeasance.
Liu Tongxun was famous in the central government because of his incorruptible personality. He investigated several cases of Manchu officials who got involved in Malfeasance.
In 1741, he indicted Grand Councilor Zhang Tingyu, Grand Secretary Noqin of in order to curb nepotism factionalism.
In 1753, he was sent to Lower Yangzi valley(Yangzte valley) to investigate river conservancy. During this investigation, he found two officials Gao Bin and Zhang Shizai who in charge of river conservancy in Yangzi, mismanaged the river conservancy and confused the financial accounts. Gao and Zhang lost their positions after verified misconducts.
In 1759, he was called on to investigated a former governor in Shanxi province, Jiang Zhou. Jiang was found guilty because he had not accounted for deficits in the provincial treasury when he was in the position.
In 1760, he convicted the Chinese education commissioner of Jiangxi province, Asiha of corruption and accepting bribes from his subordinate and local gentry members.
River Conservancy.
Although the Qing court took various measures to strengthen regulation in river conservancy and spent a large amount of money, but gained little success. In 1736, the emperor promoted Liu Tongxun to Grand Secretariat, and followed the another Grand Secretary Ji Zengyun to Zhejiang province to study river conservancy.
In 1746, Liu Tongxun served as governor of the transport of water. In 1748, Liu Tongxun and his colleague Gaobin inspected the relief work in Shandong Province and investigated the river courses. At that time, the canal rose quickly and Liu Tongxun asked for permission to divert the canal water out of the sea. After the fall, the height of the two embankments will be raised again, blocking the water and preventing dam breaches and floods.
Quell Zunghar Mongols.
Between 1757 and 1759, the Qianlong Emperor invaded the territory around the Tarim Basin for the expansion of its territory. Liu Tongxun did not consider it necessary to conquer this huge ranch that had not traditionally threatened China's homeland. He suggested that the main force should be temporarily withdrawn to Hami to avoid any further losses. However, the Qianlong Emperor was mad and would not accept this admonition. This time, Liu Tongxun was put in jail for a long time. Later, the Qianlong Emperor ordered the release of him and his family, and returned his property.

Christine A. Desan

Christine A. Desan is an American academic. She is the Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law at the Harvard Law School and, with Sven Beckert, co-director of the Program on the Study of Capitalism at Harvard University.
Christine Desan founded and is the managing director of a website, JustMoney.Org, that analyzes money as a legal institution. She serves on the advisory boards for Capitalism and History and The Journal of Law and Political Economy. In 2019, Desan delivered the Adam Smith Lecture on Jurisprudence at the University of Glasgow.
Education.
Desan graduated in 1981 from Princeton University majoring in Religion. She earned her Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy in 1987 from Yale Law School and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. After graduation, she worked in the U.S. Office of the Solicitor General.
She clerked for Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.
Field of interest.
Desan's work focuses on monetary history and theory. She argued in her 2014 book, "Making Money: Coin, Currency, and the Coming of Capitalism" (Oxford 2014), that a profound change in money's design occurred when the British government began to share money-making authority with investors incorporated as a national bank (Bank of England). That monetary transformation would soon expand to include a powerful financial architecture. Over the decades of the 18th century, the British developed circulating public debt, capital markets, and commercial banking. Those institutions worked synergistically with the Bank of England as it grew into a central bank. Desan identifies that quartet of institutions as central to and characteristic of the modern capitalism that went viral across the globe.
According to Desan, the revolution in monetary design included conceptual or ideological shifts that have come to be identified with classical and modern liberalism. A prime example of such change is the revision of older attitudes towards self-interest and usury. By contrast to medieval approaches, the British government institutionalized an orientation towards material self-interest as a legitimate incentive for a public-regarding activity when it incorporated the Bank of England. While the medieval world rejected the motive to profit from making money, the British ordained it patriotic. Likewise, their government encouraged people to lend to the government through public bonds that returned interest to those holding them.
Desan is known for pioneering a "constitutional approach" to money and finance. According to that approach, money and finance are fields of public activity or forms of governance. Observing that modern moneys are anchored at the center by sovereign authority, Desan argues that they are basically public projects: creating a medium allows a government to measure resources and mobilize them. More particularly, Desan observes that political authorities have unique capacity to create a unit of account that will be widely accepted. As "stakeholder" within a community supported by member resources, a government can pay a member in a credit unit for advance contributions. That unit will hold value insofar as the government agrees to accept the credit unit back in lieu of future contributions. When a unit holds predictable value, demand among individuals to use it in private exchange also increases, accounting for the premium that money offers in cash services. The public definition of money makes it the original "safe asset."
According to Desan, government authority characterizes modern payments systems even if a government delegates enormous authority to private entities, like the commercial banks that today multiply the monetary base. Desan identifies private banking activity as a design choice within the financial architecture, analogous to minting on demand in commodity money worlds. A medium that measures value and provides a mode of payment is useful to private as well as public actors. By delegating money creation to commercial banks, a government can ensure elasticity in the money supply.
The constitutional approach contrasts with many conventions about money, which assume that it arose from barter or private exchange among individuals. Desan's recent work argues that such theories cannot explain how decentralized agents have a commensurable unit in which to work. More generally, Desan critiques neoclassical economics on the ground that it naturalizes existing arrangements and reifies "the market" as a sphere with a self-evident structure. Her work contends that design features associated with modern monetary systems are distributively non-neutral, contributing to escalating inequality.
Desan's earlier work focused on the monetary practice in early America. Before she began working on money, Desan analyzed legislative practices in early America. She coined the term "legislative adjudication" to refer to the authority that legislatures asserted to respond to claims for money from the public fisc. Those claims were generally made by petition given the sovereign immunity that protected legislatures from suit.
Activism.
While in Brookline, Massachusetts, Desan served for 10 years on a town committee that researched and drafted legislation promoting campaign finance reform and supervised that reform once it was enacted.
With Elizabeth Bartholet and James Cavallaro, Desan co-authored and organized an Open Letter to the U.S. Congress Concerning Human Rights Abuses at Abu Ghraib (presented June 16, 2004), signed by 509 law professors.
Desan co-signed the 2014 public statement by members of the faculty of Harvard Law School that objected to the "Sexual Harassment Policy and Procedures" imposed by the central university administration as insufficient to project the values associated with due process.
Desan was also a co-signatory to the open letter addressed, on 4 October 2018, to the U.S. Senate that argued against the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh as a Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court.
In 2017, Desan authored a letter signed by 81 Harvard Law School colleagues condemning President Trump rhetoric that incited violence.
In 2020, Desan co-authored a second letter condemning President Trump for his pledge to use excessive force against Black Lives Matter protesters. The letter was signed by 165 Harvard Law School colleagues.
Desan supports an initiative to establish a public bank in Massachusetts and serves on the Steering Committee of the Massachusetts Public Banking Group.

Répertoire de vedettes-matière de l'Université Laval

The Répertoire de vedettes-matière de l'Université Laval (RVM) is a controlled vocabulary made up of four mostly bilingual thesauruses. It is designed for document indexers, organizations that want to describe the content of their documents or of their products and services, as well as anyone who wants to clarify vocabulary in English and French as part of their work or research.
RVM was created and is updated by the Répertoire de vedettes-matière section of the Université Laval Library in Québec City, and it contains over 300,000 authority records. It is used by over 200 public and private libraries and documentation centres in Québec, across Canada and some other countries, mostly in Europe.
History.
The Répertoire de vedettes-matière was created in 1946, when Université Laval librarians took the initiative to reuse the catalogue records from the Library of Congress's National Union Catalog to describe the documents in their collection. Before the copy cataloguing movement, the practice of reusing these records provided considerable savings despite the time needed to translate them. A list of subject headings was gradually compiled in French to provide descriptions of and access to local documentary resources.
After the first official edition of the Répertoire was published in 1962, RVM attracted the attention of major documentary institutions in Québec and across Canada that recognized it as an essential tool for systemizing and standardizing methods for representing the content of their collections. The National Library of Canada adopted RVM in the French version of Canadiana, the National Bibliography of Canada, and gave it national standard status in 1974. A formal collaboration agreement between the two institutions was signed, and the first team of librarians dedicated solely to the intellectual management of RVM was established at Université Laval.
It was also in 1974 that the Bibliothèque publique d'information in Paris started using RVM, which was emerging on the scene both in French-speaking countries and around the world. In 1980 the Université Laval Library signed a collaboration agreement with France's National Library, Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF), allowing it to use RVM as the basic corpus for creating its subject headings authority index, known as Répertoire d'autorité matière encyclopédique et alphabétique unifié (RAMEAU), the only French-language equivalent of RVM still in use today.
RVM's content and structure reflect its close relationship to the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), but RVM has nonetheless maintained its independence. In addition to developing original headings, RVM has expanded by adding subject headings whose English equivalents come from other source files more specialized than the LCSH. This expansion began in 1978 with the Canadian Subject Headings, followed in 1994 by the Medical Subject Headings from the United States National Library of Medicine and the Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) from the J. Paul Getty Trust.
The 9th and final paper edition of RVM was published in 1983 and was the first user manual. In 2008 Université Laval and ASTED (Association pour l'avancement des sciences et des techniques de la documentation) jointly published a practical guide on the Répertoire de vedettes-matière.
In 2010 the first RVM website was launched. In 2017 it launched its new Web platform, which provides access to more powerful search and display features, new indexing support tools, and translations and adaptations of three new thesauruses developed by the Library of Congress : the Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms (LCGFT), the Library of Congress Medium of Performance Thesaurus for Music (LCMPT), and the Library of Congress Demographic Group Terms (LCDGT).
The thesauruses.
RVM (Topics).
RVM (Topics) is an encyclopedic thesaurus whose terms are classified according to a specific syntax. It is a translation and adaptation of the following thesauruses :
It also contains original authorities exclusive to RVM, as well as equivalence with RAMEAU of Bibliothèque nationale de France.
RVM (Topics) includes:
Here are a few examples of subject headings used in the Université Laval Library catalogue. These headings appear as is in the topic field in the bibliographic records :
RVMGF.
RVMGF is a translation and adaptation of Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms (LCGFT). It includes genre/form terms that make it possible to identify resources by their genre or form, thereby providing more options for indexing and identifying various kinds of documents.
Some examples :
RVMMEM.
RVMMEM is a translation and adaptation of the Library of Congress Medium of Performance Thesaurus for Music (LCMPT). It includes medium of performance terms for music designed to represent the instruments, performers, and ensembles involved in a musical score or sound recording. These terms make it possible to describe and identify musical pieces based on specific criteria with regard to the number of performance media involved in the performance of the piece being searched.
Some examples :
RVMGD.
RVMGD is a translation and adaptation of the Library of Congress Demographic Group Terms (LCDGT). It includes demographic group terms that make it possible to define the characteristics of the intended audiences of resources, and also the creators of, and contributors to, those resources.

Mary Ann Kerwin

Mary Ann Kerwin (born 1931) is an American lawyer and breastfeeding activist. One of the seven founders of La Leche League in 1956, she established the Colorado branch of the advocacy group and drafted state laws on behalf of women who breastfeed their infants in public and in the workplace. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2012.
Early life, education, and marriage.
Mary Ann Collins was born in Wisconsin in 1931 and moved to the Chicago area as a child. She earned her B.A. in English literature, minoring in education, at Barat College of the Sacred Heart, a Roman Catholic college in Lake Forest, Illinois, in 1953.
After graduation she took some teaching jobs; later she worked as a travel agent. In December 1954, she married Thomas Joseph Kerwin (1930–2008), a graduate of Loyola University. They had six sons, one of whom died in infancy, and three daughters.
La Leche League.
In 1956 Kerwin's sister-in-law, Mary White, invited her to the inaugural meeting of La Leche League at White's home. The idea for a breastfeeding advocacy organization was developed by White and Marian Tompson while they breastfed their infants at a church picnic in summer 1956. At the time, American mothers interested in natural childbirth and breastfeeding received little support from the medical community. In the US, only one in five newborns were breastfed from birth; most were immediately fed from bottles. Other women approached the two to discuss their experiences breastfeeding their infants and the discouragement they had received from pediatricians. White and Thompson decided to start a breastfeeding advocacy group and invited a few women, who invited their acquaintances; the seven founders were White, Tompson, Kerwin, Edwina Froehlich, Viola Lennon, Mary Ann Cahill, and Betty Wagner, all Catholic mothers. Kerwin, expecting her second child at the time, had received help from White and her husband, Dr. Gregory White, a family doctor, to successfully breastfeed her first baby.
The women held several meetings at White's house in Franklin Park, Illinois, to discuss the type of information and support breastfeeding mothers would need. They held their first official meeting on October 17, 1956 at White's house, attended by the seven founders and five of their acquaintances who were expecting. Their second meeting drew 30 attendees, and the fourth attracted a standing-room-only audience. The women developed a series of monthly educational meetings, and near the end of the decade began publishing informational material. In 1958 Kerwin co-authored the group's first handbook, "The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding".
In 1960 the Kerwins moved to Denver, where they purchased the Cranmer House, residing there for three decades. Kerwin founded the Colorado chapter of La Leche League and also served as chair of the international board.
Legal career.
In 1986 Kerwin earned her J.D. at the University of Denver. She practiced family law and general litigation until retiring.
As the Colorado Breast-feeding Task Force Legislation Representative for the Colorado Breast-feeding Coalition, Kerwin drafted several pieces of legislation on behalf of nursing women. The two that were passed into law were the 2004 Breastfeeding in Public Act and the 2008 Nursing Mothers' Act for Workplace Accommodation. In 2006 Kerwin withdrew her draft legislation aimed at protecting a woman's right to pump breast milk in the workplace due to lack of support from the governor.
Awards and honors.
Kerwin was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2012.

Petty Castle

Petty Castle, near Petty, Highland, Scotland, was a motte-and-bailey castle. The castle was the caput of the barony of Petty. Petty was held by the de Moravia family in the 13th century. The motte and bailey castle appears to have been replaced by the House of Petty by the 16th century, as the motte and bailey was known as Halhill, after being raided by the Mackintosh family, after the lands were given to John Ogilvy of Strathearn. 
An inventory of the contents in 1517 includes masonry tools; halberds, axes, and Jedburgh staves, bows and arrows, and armour; wool and linen cloth and yarn; clothes and furniture; five barrels of wine; and farm tools and ploughs.
The Mackintosh family was later granted Petty. The lands were granted to James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray by his half-sister, Mary, Queen of Scots, following her return to Scotland in 1561. Castle Stuart was erected to the south east and was completed in 1625.

Career.
"Independent's Day".
Shot in 1996–1997, Zenovich’s first film "Independent's Day" premiered at the Slamdance Film Festival in 1998. The documentary was inspired by the three filmmakers who founded the aforementioned festival, after being rejected by the more established Sundance Film Festival. Zenovich's documentary explores the struggles of independent filmmakers and includes interviews with Steven Soderbergh, Greg Mottola, Tom DiCillo, Eric Schaeffer, Sydney Pollack, Parker Posey, Roger Ebert, John Pierson, among others.
While screening Independent’s Day on the festival circuit, Zenovich met investor Bob Sturm who hired her to work at his new film company Catch 23 Entertainment. Zenovich started out in the development department and went on to become Senior Vice President of Film Development &amp; Production, while continuing to make documentaries on the side.
"Who Is Bernard Tapie?".
Zenovich's next film idea came about in 1997, after a screening at the Directors Guild of America, where French filmmaker Claude Lelouch introduced his film . Lelouche mentioned that the star of the film, Bernard Tapie, was in jail, prompting Zenovich to find out why. She spent several years going back and forth to Paris, shooting footage for "Who Is Bernard Tapie?" Unable to get an interview with Tapie, Zenovich filmed herself as she tried to contact the actor/businessman, hoping to get his attention. The 2001 documentary, with Steven Soderbergh as its executive producer, was aired on the Sundance Channel and as an episode of the BBC's Storyville series. Zenovich was also profiled in the New York Times about her quest to make the documentary.
"Estonia Dreams of Eurovision!".

"Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired".
Zenovich came up with the subject of her next documentary film, after reading a story in the "Los Angeles Times" in 2003. The article questioned whether director Roman Polanski could re-enter the United States, if nominated for an Oscar for "The Pianist". Polanski had fled the U.S. in the late 1970s after being accused of sexual assault of a minor.
Five years in the making, Zenovich's "" premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, receiving wide media attention. The film's editor Joe Bini won the award for Best Editing.

"Wanted and Desired" was selected by the National Board of Review as one of the Best Documentaries of 2008.
"Roman Polanski: Odd Man Out".
Soon after its release, Polanski’s legal team used the film "" as part of their argument for reopening the 30 year old case. Since her documentary about the film director was being used as evidence, Zenovich decided to continue shooting the story. The result was a follow-up film, "Roman Polanski: Odd Man Out".
The second documentary was originally meant to examine how the central characters felt about the incident. Zenovich filmed Samantha Gailey and her mother in Hawaii, and also planned on meeting Polanski for an interview. However, two months before the scheduled interview, Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on his way to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Zurich Film Festival. As a result, Zenovich's follow-up film became linked to a big international news story.

It was also screened at the Nantucket Film Festival and had a first HBO broadcast on July 16, 2018. That same summer, the documentary was shown at the Hamptons International Film Festival SummerDocs, accompanied by a discussion with Zenovich and Q&amp;A host Alec Baldwin. Variety Magazine described the film as being "sharp-edged, humane, and deeply researched enough to take you closer to the manic engine of Williams’ brilliance and pain".
The documentary celebrates the life and career of comedian Robin Williams who died in 2014. Zenovich recorded interviews with Whoopi Goldberg, David Letterman, Billy Crystal, among others. She also included outtakes and little known clips from Williams' stand-up routines, after sifting through a large amount of archival footage.

Everyday (Logic and Marshmello song)

"Everyday" is a song recorded by American rapper Logic and music producer Marshmello, with uncredited co-production by 6ix. It was released on March 2, 2018 by Visionary Music Group and Def Jam Recordings, as the third single from Logic's from his sixth mixtape "Bobby Tarantino II", following his 2018 singles "44 More" and "Overnight". Lyrically, Logic discusses his relentless work ethic and his motivators.
Background.
Marshmello first revealed the collaboration on August 11, 2017. "Been waiting to get in the studio with [Logic] for months now," he tweeted. "He's busy crushing the game." Logic officially announced the song on February 28, 2018. Both artists posted a behind-the-scenes video on social media prior to the song's release, which shows Marshmello in the studio dancing silently in front of the mic while Logic tells him to rap.
Composition.
The electronic-leaning track features "glitchy" hi-hats and synths. According to "Rolling Stone"s Ryan Reed, it finds Logic showcasing his wide range, and "alternating between brisk triplet rhymes and tender crooning."
Critical reception.
Aron A. of HotNewHipHop regarded the song as a "melody heavy single". He felt that it "veers into a different sound for both artists", with Marshmello "diving deeper into hip hop with hints of EDM throughout" while Logic "flexes his melodic side a bit more". Kat Bein of "Billboard" regarded the song as "an ode to self-confidence from the emotionally-conscious MC currently batting a thousand" on which Marshmello "brings his trap drums to the forefront". Describing it as "bouncy, boastful and instantly enjoyable", he felt that it is "damn-near destined for radio play". Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio wrote that Marshmello "shows fans the versatility of his skills as a producer with its hip hop beat".
Music video.
Directed by Alan Ferguson, the music video was released on April 17, 2018. The video is ten minutes long, and depicts Logic as a white-collar worker. Marco Margaritoff of "Complex" describes it as a "clear tribute to films like "Fight Club" and "Office Space" which explored the mundanity of a 9-to-5, with the latter receiving the most direct homage halfway in."
Synopsis.
The video starts with Logic, who was "up all night preparing a presentation", asleep and being woke by his two bosses. Then, when the song begins, the video shifts scenes between Logic driving to and from work, and his time in the workplace. He is seen getting along with his fellow workmates, but is always being pushed around and treated unfairly by the two harsh bosses, who force him to fulfill coffee runs, data work, and loads of work. Nevertheless, he is still the most diligent worker in the office, even staying overnight to work at one point and set up the meeting space, and falls asleep again. The bosses keep assigning him loads of work to do, even when the other workers are free to not do so. As the song is at the middle of the second verse, Logic is at the office printer when a nearby clock is running faster and faster.
The music stops, and in the next scene Logic is still at the printer, but suddenly realizes that he has grown old, having spent his whole life in the workspace. The male boss approaches him with orders to make copies and wash his car. Logic refuses, and then decides to quit his job, asking everyone if anyone would like to come with him. Marshmello, who is in the back of the room, comes to join him. The song's co-producer 6ix and another fellow worker come with him as well after Logic grabs the printer. They are about to leave the office when the boss orders two security officers to "kill these fuckers" and "kick their nuts in". Logic, Marshmello, and their two workmates run with the security officers chasing them, until they realize that they outnumber the guards, and then defeat them in a fight. As the four exit the building with the printer, Logic's song "Warm It Up" plays. The four destroy the printer by stomping it and hitting it with baseball bats. After that, Logic and Marshmello get in their car and drive off. They go playing basketball and skateboard with their friends. "Everyday" then plays again where it left off. The duo continues to enjoy themselves, including doing yoga, partying and mountain climbing. By the time the song is ending, Logic and Marshmello go skydiving, where the former exclaims, "Marshmello! We're living our dreams, man! Wooo! This is insane! Wooo!"
The scene then shifts back to Logic as a young man at the printer. He is caught daydreaming, and walks away from the angry bosses, who reprimand him, until Logic interrupts. He indignantly complains that all they "constantly do is berate" him, and have forced him to work on Christmas and his birthday, even though he is the hardest worker at the office. He goes on to protest that they would not even let him visit his aunt Keesha when she got her leg amputated. He then screams, "Fuck you!" and storms off, while gasping, laughing and clapping is heard from the office workers. The male boss yells back, "Fuck your aunt!" As Logic gets to the parking lot, the two bosses and the rest of the workers walk to the window and watch him. Logic puts his suitcase in his car, and breaks into Marshmello's car next to his. He goes to a sign that says "RESERVED FOR DIVISION HEAD" with a sharpie, scribbling out the "DIVISION" and writing the word "dick" above, in capital letters with the "I" drawn out like a penis. The workers watching him cheer and clap, as the chorus of "Everyday" plays one more time. Logic drives off, and the video ends with the party scene once again. Logic's song "44 More" plays while the credits are presented.
Live performances.
On April 3, 2018, Logic performed the song live on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show". Marshmello joined him on stage alongside DeGeneres as the performance conclude.

Officine di Pietrarsa

Officine di Pietrarsa was the first Italian factory to produce locomotives, rails and rolling stock. It was founded in 1840 as "Reale Opificio Borbonico di Pietrarsa" (Royal Bourbon Factory of Pietrarsa). From 7 October 1989 the workshops, closed at the end of 1975, became the home of the National Railway Museum of Pietrarsa.
History.
The Officine di Pietrarsa, or Reale Opificio was conceived in 1840 by decree of Ferdinando II di Borbone as a plant capable of producing war and civilian material using iron from the Mongiana ironworks. A first factory had been built between San Giovanni a Teduccio and Portici in 1832, using land previously occupied by a coastal artillery battery.
In 1842, therefore only two years after the decree had been issued, the first building and ancillary rooms had already been completed, where about 200 workers worked among turners, adjusters, forgers and carpenters under the direction of the Captain of the Artillery, Don Luigi Corsi and other army officers who assisted him.
It is no coincidence that the Captain Corsi was chosen as director; he was already known to Ferdinand II for his invention of the famous "incendiary balls", a sort of shells that were inextinguishable in the water and for this reason they are very efficient in dripping down the enemy ship. Captain Corsi was born in Lucera, near Foggia on February 16, 1802. He was the son of Colonel Dionisio Corsi, a cavalry officer and Intendant General of the Province of L'Aquila, and Donna Filomena Carrascon, herself from a family of distinguished military officers (see Carascon).
On 22 May 1843 Ferdinando II issued an edict in which he said among other things: "It is Your Majesty's will that the factory of Pietrarsa takes care of the construction of the locomotives, as well as the repairs and needs for the locomotives themselves, the accessories of the wagons and wagons that will travel the new Naples - Capua railway". The goal was to free himself from foreign dependence on the production of the equipment required for the extension of the Ionian and Adriatic lines, started on the shore of the Tyrrhenian Sea. On 28 June 1844 the overhaul of the first two steam locomotives that had been built in England began. They were named "Impavido" (Fearless) and "Aligero" (Lightening). A similar locomotive, "Bayard", had been built in England by R. B. Longridge and Company in 1839 and a replica is displayed in the museum.
Production.
In 1845, production of steam locomotives began. They were designed and partially built in England but assembled on site. There were seven locomotives, which used component parts built in England, similar to the previous models purchased in 1843 that had inaugurated the first Italian railway line, the Naples–Portici railway. They were named "Pietrarsa", "La Corsi", "Robertson", "Vesuvio", "Maria Teresa", "Etna" and "Parthenope". In 1853, the work force of Pietrarsa reached about 700 people.
On 18 May 1852, in the metallurgical department, a gigantic statue of Ferdinando II was produced as a monobloc iron casting. At about 4.5 metres high, it was one of the largest works of this kind produced in Italy. It is still exhibited in the museum. In 1856 Pietrarsa was the first factory in Italy to produce rails with puddled iron from Mongiana. However, their cost was high, owing to the high price of coal imported from England. The cost of locomotives with tenders produced at the plant was acceptable and Pietrarsa was one of only two industrial plants in Italy able to produce steam locomotives at the time.
The expansion of the factory continued until the end of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, supplying material of all kinds to the railways of the kingdom. In June 1860 Pietrarsa employed 1,125 people. This comprised 850 permanent workers, 200 casual workers and 75 artillerymen to keep order. At the time, it was the largest Italian engineering factory.
Visiting dignitaries.
The plant had several important visitors including that of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, who expressed his intention to use Pietrarsa as a model for the Kronstadt railway complex. In 1849 the plant was visited by Pope Pius IX.
Ironworks commission.
In 1861 the Minister of the Navy Luigi Federico Menabrea established a "Commissione delle ferriere" (Commission of the ironworks) whose minute investigation analyzed the status of all the relevant industrial activities located on the territory of the Kingdom. The final report of the triennial investigation was published in 1864 under the care of the engineer Felice Giordano. The report showed that the costs of production of the locomotives of the two most important plants of the time (Sampierdarena and Pietrarsa) were more or less equivalent or slightly higher than those of the foreign industry. The meticulous analysis of costs and activities performed by Giordano quantified in detail the remuneration of skilled workers by category and the raw material costs of imported metal semi-finished materials. The costs at Ansaldo and Pietrarsa were shown to be substantially equivalent but the pre-eminence of these companies ended with the Bourbon regime and its protectionist policies. The higher production costs of steel products produced in the territory of the Kingdom stemmed from their foreign origin as well as the high cost of supplying the indispensable British coal.
Between 1861 and 1863 the Pietrarsa factory went into a difficult phase of its life. A report by the engineer Grandis, commissioned by the Savoy government, negatively portrayed the activity and profitability of the plant, even advising its sale or demolition. A decision was made to rationalize the steel and production sector and this choice favoured the northern industry. On 10 January 1863, the Pietrarsa plant with its contents was leased, for 30 years in the sum of 45,000 lira by the Minister of Finance of the Minghetti government to a company established by Iacopo Bozza. This resulted in job reductions, strikes and serious disorder, leading to bloody repression. On 6 August 1863 a charge of the Bersaglieri caused 7 deaths and 20 serious injuries. The first deaths were Luigi Fabbricini, Aniello Marino, Domenico Del Grosso and Aniello Olivieri.
After this, the lease was renounced and, on 20 September 1863, the government granted a new lease on the plant for 20 years to a new company, called Società nazionale di costruzioni meccaniche. This was run by the knight Gregorio Macry, the Duke Luciano Serra, the Marquis Cesare Pallavicino and the knights Maurizio Baracco and Giuseppe Carabelli. The rent started at 45,000 lira and increased every 5 years to reach a maximum of 70,000 lira. Also, the concession provided for the right to dismiss staff deemed not necessary. From 1863, Pietrarsa incorporated "l'Officina dei Granili", producing metal structural works, railway carriages and mechanical parts.
Commission report.
According to the final report of the Ironworks Commission, before 1863 the Pietrarsa workshops occupied an area of 33,600 square metres and had 850 workers. The equipment was of great importance as it was able to put on the production line at the same time 8 marine boilers or 24 locomotive boilers. The department of ironworks was equipped with 12 puddling ovens and 5 rolling mill trains, one of which was specialized for rails. The foundry department had a 12.5 tonne reverberatory furnace and 10 ovens of various types with capacities of 8.5 tonnes and 250 kg for a complex of 36 tonnes of workable iron. The foundry also had a bronze department with a 1,880 kg reverberatory oven, a 600 kg oven and various other small ovens and crucibles. The equipment was completed by three steam hammers (of 4,500, 3,500 and 800 kg) and 4 large cranes as well as all accessory equipment.
Contraction and expansion.
A locomotive for freight trains built at Pietrarsa earned a gold medal at the 1873 Vienna World's Fair. However, the drastic downsizing of Pietrarsa's labour force continued until only 100 workers remained. In 1877 the state finally intervened and took over the management directly under the direction of the engineer Passerini. This revived the company's fortunes and reversed the decline in production capacity. From 1877 to 1885, about 110 locomotives were produced, over 800 freight wagons and nearly 300 passenger carriages as well as spare parts for rolling stock. Following the Conventions of 1885 and the establishment of large railway networks, the Pietrarsa workshops were assigned to the Rete Mediterranea (Mediterranean Network) and remained part of it until 1905 when, following railway nationalization, the factory became part of the primary infrastructure of the new Ferrovie dello Stato becoming one of the large repair workshops specializing in particular in steam locomotives.
Review.
According to data provided by the official list of locomotives and railcars in service and under construction at 30 June 1914, published in 1915 by Ferrovie dello Stato, Pietrarsa produced, between 1867 and 1888, hundreds of steam locomotives with tenders for Rete Mediterranea (the Mediterranean Network), Rete Adriatica (the Adriatic Network) and their constituents. Of these, 192 were taken over by FS and registered as classes 120, 155, 185, 190, 200, 206, 215, 265, 268, 385, 391 and 420.
However, after 1888, orders for the construction of locomotives were directed to foreign factories or to northern Italy and Pietrarsa was downgraded to a maintenance and repair plant. New railway traction systems (electric and diesel) gradually displaced steam and led to the slow but inexorable decline of the plant until a closure order was issued on 15 November 1975. The last steam locomotive to be repaired (640.088) left the workshops on 2 December of the same year.
After a long period of neglect, the decision was made to transform Pietrarsa into a railway museum, housing it in the same environment that had been the oldest Italian locomotive factory. The inauguration of the Museum took place on 7 October 1989 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Italian railways. Later it was closed again and, after a long period of renovation, the museum was reopened on 19 December 2007.

Folding Boat Equipment

The Folding Boat Equipment, abbreviated as FBE, is a light pontoon bridging equipment which was in use in the British and its colonial armies during the 20th century. The equipment was introduced in 1928 and was the standard light bridge used for loads up to class 5, i.e. providing rafts or a bridge capable of transporting loads up to 5 tons of weight. The initial version was followed by a Mk II but without change of capacity. In 1938 the Mk III version of the bridge was introduced with significant changes and an increase of load capacity to 9 tons, i.e. load class 9.
The Mk III version of the bridge was easy and quick to erect, which led in 1939 to its becoming the standard light bridging equipment, initially of the British armies, and the Allied armies during World War II. The Mk III equipment was capable of providing class 5 and 9 pontoon rafts, or a class 9 bridge. The equipment provided anchoring facilities and a full width trackway. It performed well even in fast currents and could be maintained and kept in use indefinitely.
The FBE Mk III was used extensively during World War II by both British and American forces as the standard class 9 bridge. The FBE was widely used in both the European and South-East Asian theatres of war.
Configuration and deployment.
The equipment provided the following capabilities:
Bridges are constructed by joining rafts together. The connectors have limited articulation, which permits the FBE Mk II bridge to carry a load of class 5 while an FBE MK III bridge can carry a vehicle of load class 9 (approximately 10 tons). The trestles are set up at each end and fix the end of the bridge to the bank. Anchors are placed at different positions along the length to anchor the bridge from being swept away by a changed current.
Parts.
Folding Boat Equipment bridge consists of the following parts:
Folding Boat.
Each folding boat was 21 feet 10 inches long and 6 feet 8 inches wide, collapsible and could be carried flat on four-wheeled trailers or in bridging lorries. Three flat boats fitted on a trailer. Sixteen soldiers were required for manual carriage and launching a single boat. Each boat had a load capacity of 870 pounds and could accommodate 16 fully armed soldiers besides the boat commander and a crew of four.

Triplet-triplet annihilation

Triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) is an energy transfer mechanism between two molecules in their triplet state, and is related to the Dexter energy transfer mechanism. If triplet-triplet annihilation occurs between two molecules in their excited states one molecule transfers its excited state energy to the second molecule, resulting in one molecule returning to its ground state and the second molecule being promoted to a higher excited singlet, triplet or quintet state. 
Triplet-triplet annihilation was first discovered in the 1960s to explain the observation of delayed fluorescence in anthracene derivatives.
Photon upconversion.
As triplet-triplet annihilation combines the energy of two triplet excited molecules onto one molecule to produce a higher excited state it has been used to convert the energy of two photons into one photon of higher energy, a process known as photon upconversion.
To achieve photon upconversion through triplet-triplet annihilation two types of molecules are often combined: a sensitizer and an emitter (annihilator). The sensitizer absorbs the low energy photon and populates its first excited triplet state (T1) through intersystem crossing. The sensitizer then transfers the excitation energy to the emitter, resulting in a triplet excited emitter and a ground state sensitizer. Two triplet excited emitters then can undergo triplet-triplet annihilation, and if a singlet excited state (S1) of the emitter is populated fluorescence results in an upconverted photon.

Markowa Ulma-Family Museum of Poles Who Saved Jews in World War II

The Markowa Ulma-Family Museum of Poles Who Saved Jews in World War II is a museum located in Markowa, Poland. The Łańcut Castle Museum began the Ulma-Family Museum's construction in 2013, and the new Museum opened on 17 March 2016.
On 30 June 2017, pursuant to an agreement of 23 June 2017 entered into by Subcarpathian Province and Poland's Ministry of Culture and National Heritage, the Museum was incorporated as an independent legal entity, to be operated jointly by the two parties. The Ulma-Family Museum is entered in Poland's Register of Cultural Organizations as No. RIK 103/2017.
History.
The decision to build the museum was taken by the Subcarpathian Regional Assembly in June 2008. A space of 500 square meters was allocated for a restoration of the Ulma family home and for an exhibition hall, lecture hall, and research facility. Construction cost 6.5 million "złotych".
In its first year of operation, the Ulma-Family Museum hosted 50,000 visitors.
The structure and its surroundings.
The designers created a semi-glazed facade that conceals a mystery that visitors will discover. The building juts into the square. The front of the museum is a universal symbolic representation of a house, reminiscent of the history of pre-war Markowa. It suggests both the times of the "Shoah", and unchanging form and persistence in the face of historical adversities. The exhibition covers some 120 square meters.2.
The wall in front of the museum displays plaques with names of Poles who saved Jews. In the square before the museum are illuminated tablets with the names of those who died saving Jews. Due to limited space, the names of only those who were active in present-day Subcarpathian Province are given.
Next to the museum itself, a garden is being created that will commemorate with illuminated plaques the Polish cities and towns where Jewish residents were rescued by the 6,700 persons recognized as the Polish Righteous among the Nations. Some 1,500 such places have been identified. The memorial garden will incorporate the monument to the Ulma family, erected in 2004, that stands in the Markowa open-air museum.
Exhibit.
The museum commemorates all the Poles who, at the risk of their own lives, saved Jews condemned by the Germans to extermination. It was named after Markowa's Ulma family (Józef Ulma, his wife Wiktoria, and their six children), who were murdered by German gendarmes on 24 March 1944, along with the eight Jews whom they had been sheltering. Other Polish Markowa residents succeeded in saving 21 Jews.
The former Israeli ambassador to Poland Shevah Weiss has described the museum as a "Temple of Memory".

1900 United States presidential election in Idaho

The 1900 United States presidential election in Idaho took place on November 6, 1900. All contemporary 45 states were part of the 1900 United States presidential election. State voters chose three electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
Idaho was won by the Democratic nominees, William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska and his running mate Adlai Stevenson I of Illinois. Bryan and Stevenson defeated the Republican nominees, William McKinley of Ohio and his running mate Theodore Roosevelt of New York.
Bryan had previously defeated McKinley in Idaho four years earlier. He would later lose the state to William Howard Taft in 1908. As of the 2020 election this is the last election in which the Republican candidate won the presidency without Idaho.

Alfred Wöhlk

Alfred Wöhlk, also: Woehlk, Wøhlk, (1868–1949) was a Danish chemist and pharmacist. With his historical detection reaction from 1904, the lactose content of dairy products can be visualized. This is useful because many people are lactose intolerant and avoid dairy products. Countless pharmacy students, but also physicians, laboratory assistants, and recently also chemistry teachers know the Wöhlk test.
Since its discovery in 1904 until the 1960s, the Wöhlk test has mainly been used to detect the reducing disaccharide lactose in urine in medical laboratories. Although there were already a number of wet-chemical detection methods to identify sugars, such as the Fehling or Benedict test, those analyses could only differentiate between reducing and non-reducing sugars. Since both glucose and lactose molecules have an aldehyde group in the open-chain form, the result was positive in both cases. Only the Woehlk test allowed a safe differentiation between glucose and lactose.
Thus, a relatively harmless milk congestion (lactosuria) could be differentiated from a dangerous gestational diabetes. With lactose, the tested urine develops a significant red color, with glucose, only a yellow dye develops, and with sucrose, the color does not change.
Until recently there were no or only insufficient ideas about the constitution of the Woehlk and Fearon dyes and their formation. Based on the reactions known in the chemistry of carbohydrates, a structure was created which is consistent with previous experimental observations and has the corresponding features of a chromophore. It was assumed that in the Woehlk and Fearon test for lactose and maltose, the reaction of ammonia and methylamine occurs via the formyl group in C1 and the hydroxyl group in C5 forming a partially saturated heterocyclic pyridine ring.

Konflit

Konflit, formerly Konflit Dramatik, are a Canadian rap rock band, most prominent in the 2000s. One of the most prominent Franco-Ontarian musical groups of their era, the band had a varying lineup over its lifetime with vocalist Christian Berthiaume as the only constant member.
They were originally formed in 1998 in Sudbury, Ontario by Berthiaume and guitarist Édouard Landry, for the purpose of competing in the "La Brunante" music competition. They were finalists in the competition, but did not win; following the competition, the other original band members left while Berthiaume and Landry continued with David Poulin (guitar), Guy Coutu (bass) and Alain Tremblay (drums) of Les Chaizes Muzikales. They performed at Sudbury's Northern Lights Festival Boréal in 1998 and 2000, and at La Nuit sur l'étang in 2000 and 2001, before releasing their debut EP "Hors d'œuvre dresse la table" in 2001. The album's title track was released as a single in both English and French versions, with the French video receiving airplay on TFO and MusiquePlus, and the English video receiving airplay on MuchMusic. The video was filmed in the cavern at Science North.
Berthiaume, Poulin and Tremblay continued with the band, which added Jason Richer on bass and Josée Poulin on violin and keyboards. Their first full-length album, "Univers dissimulé", was released in 2003. The album won the award for francophone album of the year at the inaugural Northern Ontario Music and Film Awards, and the making of the album was filmed by John Hartman for a documentary film, which won the award for Best Film Editing at the same awards. The album's singles included "Holes in You" and "Fait à la maison". In 2004, they performed at the Francofête festival in Moncton, New Brunswick.
They released their second album, "Morgue", in 2005. Their tour to support the album included participation in Tour Tournée, a bilingual touring concert sponsored by CBC Radio 3 and Bande à part.
With a lineup now consisting of Berthiaume, Marie Boulanger on guitar and keyboards, Shawn Arseneau on bass and Cory Lalonde on drums, the band relocated to Montreal before their self-titled third album was released in 2008. The album featured the band's biggest hit, "Je t'aime Québec", which was based on a poem by Patrice Desbiens, as well as the song "La mère de toutes les dystopies", based on a poem by Robert Dickson, and a cover of Jean-Pierre Ferland's "God Is an American". The album was also accompanied by a short National Film Board documentary, "À l'ombre d'un Konflit Dramatik", about the making of the "Je t'aime Québec" video.
In 2009, the band changed its name to Konflit, and released the album "Shift". They have not released any further albums since "Shift", but released several new standalone singles to their Bandcamp page in 2013 and 2017 under a style that has evolved toward electronic trance music.

Time Orders Old Age to Destroy Beauty

Time Orders Old Age to Destroy Beauty is a 1746 allegorical oil on canvas painting by the Italian artist Pompeo Batoni. It was commissioned from him by Bartolomeo Talenti, a collector from Lucca, as a pendant for "La lascivia", now in the Hermitage Museum.

The Chinaman (album)

The Chinaman is the first studio album by American rapper by Fresh Kid Ice (Christopher Wong Won) of the 2 Live Crew. It was released on July 15, 1992 by Effect Records.
Wong Won started to work on the album in 1992, because he was troubled with the direction 2 Live Crew member Luther Campbell was taking and wanted to stay away.
It reached number 38 on the "Billboard" Heatseekers Albums chart and No. 56 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album was the first American hip hop album to embrace having an Asian heritage.
Production.
Wong Won said he took on the project in 1992, because he wanted to distanced himself from 2 Live Crew member Luther Campbell, who at the time had a beef with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. He felt it was awkward and out of place since all previous interaction with them had been friendly, hence he suggested a solo project to his label, and started it without a budget. He also said, without taking an advance, all beats were programmed in his garage with friends and artists he produced, they went into the company's studio and recorded it and that it sold over 200,000 copies with very limited promotion. The singles were"Dick 'Em Down," "I'll Be There," and "Freak 'Em Down" (the clean version of "Dick 'Em Down"). "The Chinaman" is the first American hip hop album to embrace an Asian heritage. It inverts the stereotypes into prideful declarations of self-identity. On the Billboard charts, the album peaked at No. 38 and stayed two weeks on the "Heatseekers Albums" chart. "The Chinaman" was also on the "Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums" chart for ten weeks, peaking at No. 56.

Nikolai Alexandrovich Kushelev-Bezborodko

Nikolai Alexandrovich Kushelev-Bezborodko (28 November 1834 - 11 April 1862, Nice, France) was a Russian art collector.
Life.
His father was Alexander Kushelov-Bezborodko (1800-1855), senator, state controller, count and member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, whilst his mother was Alexander's wife Alexandra Nikolaevna née Princess Repnina-Volkonskaya. After his father's death he inherited half his estate and his art collection. At the end of the Crimean War he went on a trip to Europe, where he explored several museums and exhibitions and decided to expand his father's collection. He began to actively buy up contemporary paintings and sculptures, mainly from France and in large part directly from the artists or their dealers. In a very short time he managed to expand the collection significantly - despite (or perhaps because of) his lack of age, experience and knowledge he appreciated modern artists such as Théodore Rousseau, Jules Dupré, Delacroix, Jean-François Millet, Constant Troyon Courbet and Corot and brought the Barbizon school to the attention of Russian audiences.
He died suddenly in 1862 and his artworks were added to the collections of the museum at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St Petersburg, forming a distinct Kushelevskaya Gallery of over 500 paintings and sculptures. Between 1922 and 1923 almost the whole of this collection was transferred to the Hermitage Museum, from which some of the paintings were again transferred between 1923 and 1925 to the new Pushkin Museum. The Hermitage devoted an exhibition to the collection in 1993.
 Most of the paintings from the collection are now on display on the third floor of the General Staff Building as part of the 1800-1850 rooms, whilst a room opened on the fourth floor of the same building in 2017 devoted to the Barbizon School works from the collection.

Early life and family.
Lady Kitty Spencer was born in London on 28 December 1990 to Charles Spencer, Viscount Althorp (later the 9th Earl Spencer) and Victoria Lockwood. She is a member of the Spencer family, an English noble family that holds multiple peerages.

Her paternal aunt was Diana, Princess of Wales. She is a first cousin of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex.
She was raised in Cape Town, South Africa, where she attended Reddam House, a private school. After her parents divorced in 1997, Spencer spent her time between her native United Kingdom with her father and South Africa with her mother.
In 2009 Spencer was presented as a debutante at the Hôtel de Crillon's le Bal des Débutantes in Paris. Spencer studied psychology, politics, and English literature at the University of Cape Town.

Kingdon Challoner is in love with and engaged to Eulalie Morgan. The problem is that Eulalie is of the belief that kissing and petting are forbidden prior to marriage. Beside himself, Bruce enlists the help of Bruce Sands, a renowned playboy. The two concoct a plot whereby Sands will have the opportunity to seduce Eulalie, with her believing it is Kingdon. The plan is successful with the exception of Eulalie realizing it is not Kingdon who has seduced her. She breaks off her engagement with Kingdon and proclaims her love for Bruce.
However when Eulalie goes to Bruce's place to let him know the good news, she finds a woman in his bed. Believing the woman to be Bruce's lover, she flees the scene. The woman is not a lover, but Bruce's sister, who is staying with him. When Kingdon arrives, he believes that Bruce has stolen Eulalie away from him. Bruce calms Kingdon down, getting him to understand that he has no design on Eulalie. He instructs Kingdon on how to properly seduce a woman. Kingdon pursues Eulalie, the two are reconciled and move forward with their plans for marriage.
Production.

They complimented the performances the entire cast, and specifically highlighted those of Cody and Percy. They also found the title cards unobtrusive, the sets done with elegance and taste, and the overall production quality excellent. While they did take issue with a thin plot, they found the overall script contained "very interesting character studies in situations that at times are quite dramatic and always interesting.

Sonia Bunting

Sonia Bunting, OLS (9 December 1922 – 24 March 2001) was a South African journalist, and a political and anti-apartheid activist. After being charged with treason and imprisoned, being detained a second time, and barred from publishing, she and her husband went into exile in London, where she joined the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) and organised the World Campaign for the Release of South African Political Prisoners. When the African National Congress (ANC) ban was lifted in 1991, she returned to South Africa where she was involved in political activism until her death in 2001. She was posthumously honored by the government of South Africa with the Order of Luthuli in Silver in 2010.
Early life.
Sonia Beryl Isaacman was born on 9 December 1922 in Johannesburg, South Africa to Dora and David Isaacman. Her parents were Jewish exiles, who had fled from Eastern Europe to escape anti-Semitic pogroms. After her matriculation from her secondary education, Isaacman enrolled at the University of the Witwatersrand to pursue medical studies. In 1942, while studying at university, she joined the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA), the only multiracial political party in the country at that time. She began campaigning for universal suffrage and subsequently terminated her medical studies after completing one year of schooling.
Career.
Isaacman went to work in the offices of the SACP, where she met Brian Bunting, a young World War II veteran and fellow communist. In 1946, the couple married and they relocated to Cape Town, where their three children, Peter, Margaret and Stephen were born. Bunting continued working for the SACP there, and also began working at the Cape Town Peace Council as its secretary. When in 1950, Communism and the party were banned in South Africa, she began working at "The Guardian", a newspaper with communist ties. When it was banned and renamed "The Spark", and then subsequently banned and renamed "New Age", she continued working for the paper. Appointed as a member of the delegation led by Ahmed Kathrada to represent South Africa, at the 3rd World Festival of Youth and Students, she traveled to East Berlin in 1951. In 1953, the party reorganized under the name of the South African Communist Party (SACP), and Bunting was one of its founding members. In reaction to increased restrictive legislation passed by the pro-Apartheid government, she focused on political activity. As a white woman, she was in a unique position to speak out against racial oppression. She was invited as one of the platform speakers at the 1955 Congress of the People held in Kliptown, where the Freedom Charter was adopted.
In 1956, Bunting, Kathrada, and 154 other activists were arrested and charged with high treason. The trial lasted until 29 March 1961, but Bunting was acquitted along with 91 others and returned to her home and children in October 1958. The year following her release, she was barred from attendance at meetings and forced to withdraw from twenty-six organizations with which she was affiliated. In March 1960 when the Sharpeville massacre occurred, Bunting was arrested again and held in the Pretoria Central Prison for more than three months. "New Age" was banned and closed in 1962, and all the journalists working there, which included Bunting, her husband, Ruth First and Govan Mbeki among others, were barred from publishing. She and her husband were placed under 24-hour house arrest for a five year period, making political activity impossible. The situation led the Buntings into deciding to leave South Africa for London in 1963. The exit visas for their exile stated that they could never return to South Africa.
Upon arrival in London, Bunting joined the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) and continued her political work with the SACP. When Nelson Mandela was arrested, the World Campaign for the Release of South African Political Prisoners was established with Bunting as its organizer. She mobilized efforts to place economic sanctions on South Africa and isolate the country from the world economy, as well as headed up the efforts to publicize the situation in South Africa and the plight of Mandela and other political prisoners. She has been widely credited and is most remembered for her role in organizing the campaign to save Mandela from the gallows when the Rivonia Trial took place. When the trial ended and the defendants were sentenced to prison, she continued to work for their release, through the only "operating office of the SACP in the world", which was headquartered at 39 Goodge Street, London. Simultaneously, in 1968, she began coordinating the publishing efforts of the "African Communist", the quarterly journal of the SACP, while working full time at the "Inkululeko Publications". For almost two decades, she engaged in all of these activities as well as speaking engagements aimed at a free South Africa and a world which recognized the human rights of people throughout the world.
In 1991, after twenty-eight years in exile, the couple returned to Cape Town, when the bans against the SACP and the African National Congress (ANC) were lifted. Bunting served for the ANC in the campaigns of the 1994 and 1999 elections and was one of the founders of the Cape Town Friends of Cuba, continuing her political activities until her death.
Death and legacy.
Bunting died on 24 March 2001 in Cape Town. In 2010 she was honored by President Jacob Zuma with the Silver Order of Luthuli for her commitment to racial equality, human rights and nation-building efforts in South Africa.

Bipolar Explorer

Bipolar Explorer is an American dreampop band from New York City. Formed in its present state and genre by band co-founders Summer Serafin (vocals, spoken word) and Michael Serafin-Wells (guitars, bass guitar, percussion, vocals, spoken word), the group has released eight albums and six singles on Slugg Records beginning with 2012's double-album "Of Love and Loss". The band became a trio with the addition of French Sylvia Solanas (spoken word) in 2018.
Formation and Of Love And Loss.
After an initial indie rock release – "Go Negative" (2005, Slugg Records) featuring former Uncle bandmates Michael Serafin-Wells (songwriter, guitars, bass guitar, vocals) and Yves Gerard (drums, backing vocals) – still very much in the style of their previous group, Bipolar Explorer changed direction and personnel re-configuring under the influence of co-founder and vocalist Summer Serafin.
Debuting the new sound in live performance at New York's Cooper Square Hotel, PopMatters described the band as "eclectic, powerful and steadfast" and the group began work on an EP recording for Slugg Records in Brooklyn.
Before it could be completed, on March 18, 2011, Ms. Serafin passed away after a tragic accident. She was just 31.
Many months later, armed with newly written songs post-tragedy, Serafin-Wells and the band returned to those recordings and in October 2012 released a double-album of, for and about Ms. Serafin. Entitled "Of Love and Loss", Ground Control Magazine’s Daryl Darko Barnett pronounced it "the most significantly stirring and addictive musical accomplishment we’ve come across in some time", naming it to their Critics Poll of Best Albums of the Year.
Angels and BPXmas.
At the end of 2014, the band released two albums in quick succession, a holiday one "BPXmas" on December 3, 2014 and "Of Love and Loss"’s follow-up, "Angels" on New Year's Day 2015.
Both critically acclaimed, NPR’s "On Being" noted the band's reworking holiday classics in their signature dream pop style and both albums began rotation on WFMU, notably finding favor with the station's legendary deejay Irene Trudel who called their sound "great, beautiful drifty-pop".
Ground Control’s Daryl Darko Barnett wrote a feature about the former "Bipolar Explorer Work a Double-Shift Through the Holidays" and ended 2015 by naming "Angels" to his number one spot in the magazine's Best Albums of the Year round up, calling it "electrifying -what music fueled by raw love and emotions sounds like".
Electric Hymnal.
In June 2016, the band released their fifth album, a collection of devotional songs and spoken word, both sacred and secular, described as "a sonic prayer" for their fallen bandmate, Ms. Serafin. Their first foray into the use of spoken word as a component of their sound, Serafin-Wells would return to its use, composing narrative poetry for a female voice and underscoring it with ambient, post-rock guitars in subsequent releases. Again, Ground Control hailed the work "...Get ready to be swept up and away by a prayerful reverie of melodies. Listening, I began to feel like I was flying. Don't forget that Bipolar Explorer is a post-rock band. Low growling vocals, gnarly grinding tempos, rhythmic looping strands that escape and rise above the weight of this world, where angels and the living mingle..."
Featuring album art by American artist Michael Creese, "Electric Hymnal" was released as a limited-edition CD only (no digital) and given away by the band to fans upon request as "a gift of faith".
Dream Together.
On New Year's Day 2017, the band released their sixth album, "Dream Together". WFMU’s Liz Berg featuring tracks on her show called it "just a great record". Again, WFMU’s Irene Trudel, praising it as "beautiful, full of sadness and wonder". The album made its way onto the charts of California's free-form KDVS, as well, starting as the station's No. 4 New Add the first week of January and rising to No. 18 overall in the weeks after.
Reaching Europe, the album was praised by France's Indiemusic as "Magical and majestic – an ultimate tour-de-force" .
On February 20, 2017, the magazine's Associate Editor, Raphael Duprez, followed up with an interview with Michael. 
In answer to a question about how he and the band continue in light of the tragic events of 2011 he replied, "All of this is entirely for her. I often say that our music, each album, is of, for and about her. It's my way of telling people about her and talking to her myself. That's the "for’ and "about" parts of the equation. And Summer remains an integral part of the band – not only as its inspiration but, because I have lots of her isolated vocals from other recording sessions – as her voice, both spoken and singing, graces each record. I'll write songs and fly in her voice. Summer isn't the main reason BPX goes on, she's the only reason. She is the reason. And I think I can trust that I'm doing things for the right reason if I always know the reason for it is her. Not out of any ambition other than to honor and conjure her. She's my conscience."
Sometimes in Dreams.
On New Year's Day 2018, the band released their seventh album, a double-album, called "Sometimes in Dreams". Surface Noise's Joe McGasko called it "Epic and affecting", the new album again found its way quickly onto playlists at WFMU, notably both Irene Trudel and Gaylord Field's shows, on Tuesday and Sunday nights, respectively.
On January 2, France's Indiemusic called the new album "Unforgettable and essential. Have no doubt, this is a major record."
By May 2018, "Sometimes in Dreams" had reached the No. 19 position on WFMU's album charts, leading medium rotation and officially entered the North American College and Community Radio (NACC) charts, tracking college radio airplay in the US and Canada.
Til Morning Is Nigh.
In November 2018, the band's eighth album,"Til Morning Is Nigh: A Dream Of Christmas", was released. Featuring new additional instrumentation including synth, organ and melodica, the band also welcomed a new member, Sylvia Solanas, who voices spoken word and with whom Serafin-Wells started a parallel dreampop band under the name Tremosphere.
As they started working on both an EP for Tremosphere and the Christmas album for Bipolar Explorer, Serafin-Wells got hit by a car in New York City, suffering from several severe injuries followed by a near-fatal pulmonary embolism, thus being hospitalized for several weeks.
Both albums were eventually recorded and released, "Til Morning Is Nigh: A Dream Of Christmas" later than planned, at the end of 2018, and the Tremosphere EP turned into a full album, "Interiors", in 2019, with Serafin-Wells still in convalescence.
"Til Morning Is Nigh: A Dream Of Christmas" was well received, getting radio plays in Australia, as well as in America on WFMU, and in the UK on The Sound Projector Radio Show on London's Resonance FM.
The Dark Outside, The Light Within/Til Morning Is Nigh Documentary.
In July 2019 the band released their fifth single, "The Dark Outside, The Light Within" – composed and recorded for London's experimental radio show "The Dark Outside" and premiered in a special event broadcast on June 20, 2019 on London's 87.7fm. 
July 2019 also marked the group's Dutch radio debut on Radio Hoogeveen's post-rock show, De Mist, and the completion of a six-part mini documentary about their eighth album – The Making of "Til Morning Is Nigh", which premiered episodically August–September 2019 on the band's YouTube channel.

Martin Lorentzon

Sven Hans Martin Lorentzon (; born 1 April 1969) is a Swedish entrepreneur and co-founder of Tradedoubler and Spotify. From 2013 to 2018 he was on the board of Telia Company. Since April 2019 he has been an expert on Sweden's immigrants' integration issues for the Moderate Party commission "New Swedish Model".
Career.
As a student at the primary school in Borås, Lorentzon told classmates that he wanted to sell one matchbox to every Chinese person and become a billionaire. In high school he attended the technical department of Sven Eriksonsgymnasiet, where he liked to go to parties but always put education first: if there was a party before a test he would lie that he was sick and would have to stay home.
In 1990 Lorentzon began his studies at the Chalmers University of Technology where he studied industrial economics and later finished with a master of science and engineering degree. He attended economics courses at the Gothenburg School of Business, Economics and Law. Lorentzon also studied economics at the Stockholm School of Economics and took courses in rhetoric and argumentation at Stockholm University.
In 1995 Lorentzon started an internship at a telephone company, Telia. He moved to San Francisco and worked in the AltaVista office there. In Silicon Valley he met skilled web entrepreneurs and found a job at a investment company called Cell Ventures, where he met Felix Hagnö, the son of the owners of a Swedish clothing line called Joy. In September 1999 Lorentzon and Hagnö founded Netstrategy, which would later become the leading European marketplace Tradedoubler. The company soon became commercially profitable and socially acclaimed: in 2001 it won the Swedish Guldmusen prize for "IT-rookie of the Year", the Swedish Trade Council in the United Kingdom prize "Achievement Award" in 2002 for Swedish companies that have been the most successful in the UK over the past year, and the Swedish "Export Hermes" prize in 2004 for the best Swedish exporting company. Lorentzon then moved to Germany. Web sales peaked and in 2005 he sold his Tradedoubler option for US$70 million. He admitted the role of luck in this success. Lorentzon moved back to Sweden after ten years abroad. In March 2006 Tradedoubler bought advertising service Advertigo, created by Daniel Ek. Ek and Lorentzon quickly became friends, finding that they had common experiences of depression because of unexpected wealth and a lack of purpose.
From April 2013 — March 2018 Lorentzon served as a member of the board of directors at Telia, where he also owned 230,000 shares. He is an investor in student.com, a service that helps students find accommodation.
Spotify.
In April 2006 Ek and Lorentzon decided to start a new company. Lorentzon left the board of Tradedoubler and gave one million euros to Ek. In June 2006 Spotify was registered. Spotify was started as a music streaming service earning its profits from online advertising, a business that they both knew very well.
Lorentzon spent his own money on developers' salaries, offices, and renting music licenses. They tried to attract investor money, but Lorentzon was not satisfied with the terms with which they were offered to cooperate. Because of these unplanned expenses, Lorentzon's share in Spotify turned out to be the largest. His option was estimated at more than US$ 4 billion; he holds 43.3% voting rights and owns 12.7% shares. Hagnö decided to join in his former colleague's venture, and owns 6.6% of the shares worth US$1.5 billion.
Lorentzon was a chief executive officer from 2006 — 2013 and a chairman of board of directors from 2008 — 2016, until Ek took over these roles. In interviews Ek and Lorentzon claim that they are best friends and there has not been a day since 2006 when they did not speak at least once a day. Lorentzon is responsible for developing the company's future goals and development strategy, budget, salaries, verification of legal and annual financial reports.
Political views.
In 2013 Lorentzon joined Prince Daniel's Fellowship Project, and visits upper secondary schools, universities, and university colleges around Sweden to inspire young people to get involved in entrepreneurship. In 2016 he was elected as a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences under the Department of Education and Research, which promotes contact and exchange between business, research, and government entities.
In April 2013, media scrutiny focused on Lorentzon's relationship with the Swedish tax office. Lorentzon's Spotify and Telia-affiliated companies are situated in offshore financial centres: Rosello is registered in Cyprus and Amaltea is in Luxembourg. In 2005, he re-registered TradeDoubler on Cyprus, reducing his tax payment by $9 million. In 2006 he paid 1.4 million euro in taxes. Spotify was also re-registered by that time in Luxembourg, where income tax is lower. According to media reports, Lorentzon owes the Swedish tax office 6 million euro for 2007–2010, during which he filed a zero-income declaration.
In 2014, Lorentzon was named International Swede of the Year, and in 2015, he was awarded the Affärsbragden (The Business Achievement) from the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. In the spring of 2015 Lorentzon was given an honorary doctorate at the Chalmers University of Technology. 
In April 2019 Lorentzon was assigned an immigrants' integration issues expert in a Moderate Party commission "New Swedish Model" created by Ulf Kristersson.
Personal life.
Lorentzon was born on 1 April 1969 in the south of Sweden in the village of Åsenhöga, in the Gnosjö region of Småland province. In February 1970, his family moved to Borås, and he grew up in the quarter. His mother, Brita (born 21 September 1936), worked as a teacher, and his father, Sven, (born 1 July 1932) was an economist. Lorentzon has two older siblings. He has lived in Vasastan, Stockholm, since 2005. He also owns an apartment in the ski resort community of Åre.
Since 2017, Lorentzon has been in a relationship with Tara Derakshan, a Swedish entrepreneur of Iranian origin. He is also an investor in her startup, Sniph, a perfume subscription box. 
Lorentzon has been living with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

History and current use.
Double T State Fish and Wildlife Area is undergoing remediation as land that was strip mined for coal. The State of Illinois acquired the land making up this wildlife site in September 2001. The IDNR states that the area is being targeted for restoration activities and enhancement of wildlife habitat.

Nikolai Repnin-Volkonsky

Prince Nikolai Grigoryevich Repnin-Volkonsky (Russian: Николай Григорьевич Репнин-Волконский; 1778 - 6/18 January 1845 Yahotyn, now in Ukraine) was a general in the Imperial Russian Army.
Life.
He was the son of general prince Grigorij Semënovič Volkonsky, but the adoptive son of his maternal grandfather Nicholas Repnin. He joined the Russian Guards before taking up a colonelcy in the Chevalier Guards during the campaign against the French. He was captured at the battle of Austerlitz and only freed after the Peace of Tilsit. He was promoted to major general and was made ambassador to the Kingdom of Westphalia in 1809 and Spain in 1810. In 1809 he was elected an honorary member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences.
He returned to Russia in 1811 and a year later was put in command of a cavalry regiment in the army department commanded by Peter Wittgenstein. In October 1813, after the battle of Leipzig, he became Governor-General (Viceroy) in Saxony, until being replaced by the Prussian General Government in November 1814. During this period he worked to stabilise and rebuilt Saxony and attempted to turn its capital Dresden into the centre of German art, commissioning the external staircase to Brühl's Terrace and opening the Großer Garten to the public. He also put up a monument on the Räcknitzhöhe near Dresden to the wounding of Jean-Victor Moreau.
He took part in the Hundred Days campaign and the Council of Vienna. In 1816 he became governor of the Province of Poltava and in 1835 a member of the State Council.

Experimental three-phase railcar

The Three-phase railcar (Ger: " Drehstrom-Triebwagen") was an experimental railcar built in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century to assess the possibilities in using electric motive power for rail transport.
Background.
The 19th century saw the invention of the modern railway and their rapid expansion into national networks in Europe and worldwide. During this period motive power was confined to steam locomotives, some of which by mid-century were capable of top speeds of , with average express journey speeds of .
The 1880s saw the development of electric power and its application to rail transport. Electric power offered several advantages over steam; it is more efficient, allowing more rapid acceleration, and a higher power output when necessary. Its disadvantage is the high initial cost of the infrastructure involved, such as the power production and distribution system needed.
1879 saw the demonstration of an experimental system by Werner von Siemens in Berlin, which was followed by an electric tramway at Lichterfelde, in 1881, and heavy rail applications in 1890 (the City and South London Railway) and 1895 (the Baltimore Belt Line).
In 1899 a consortium of ten of the largest and wealthiest companies in Germany joined together to form the "Research Association for High-speed Electric Railways"() ("Studiengesellschaft für elektrische Schnellbahnen", or St.E.S.) to examine the possibilities of high-speed electric rail travel.
Research Association for High-speed Electric Railways.
The St.E.S consortium, which included Siemens &amp; Halske, the engineering company AEG, and the Deutsche Bank, was founded on 10 October 1899 and given leave to electrify a length of the Royal Prussian Military Railway between Marienfelde, near Berlin, and Zossen, a distance of . 
The line was electrified with three-phase power at 10 kV/50 Hz, using three overhead lines on poles that were about high located at the side of the track.
This work was completed by the spring of 1901.
The three-phase railcar.
The society commissioned two railcars for testing. These were built by , a Cologne rolling-stock manufacturer and consortium member, with Siemens and AEG supplying the electrical equipment. The cars were of standard size, with a capacity for 50 passengers, mounted on two six-wheel bogies, the outer axle being motorized. The power was drawn down from the three power cables running along the side of the track by three vertical catenaries, mounted on two towers fore and aft on the roof of the carriage. The electrical system was rated at 6–14 kV, operating at 25–50 Hz, giving a power equivalent of .
The summer of 1901 saw a series of test runs, culminating in record-breaking speeds of . These tests revealed weaknesses in the trackbed, which had to be re-laid. 
Following this, in the autumn of 1903, a series of high-speed runs were achieved; of , by the Siemens railcar, on 6 October, and , by the AEG railcar, three weeks later, on 28 October 1903. This set a land speed record for rail vehicles (electric) which stood for the next 51 years.
The tests had shown what was possible with electric motive power, but the three-phase system was too complex, and the cost of installation too prohibitive, for general use across the rail network. With this the St.E.S was wound up and the infrastructure dismantled. 
However advances in technology, particularly in semiconductors, are believed to offer new possibilities with the three-phase system.

Edward Eddrup

Canon Edward Paroissien Eddrup (1823 – 13 November 1905) was a Church of England clergyman who spent most of his career in Wiltshire, England.
The eldest son of Edward Charles Eddrupp, Esq., of St Catherine Cree, in the City of London, he was born in Leadenhall Street. On 27 January 1841, at the age of seventeen, he matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, and went on to graduate B.A. in 1845, and M.A. in 1847. While at the university he was a member of the Oxford Society for Promoting the Study of Gothic Architecture. 
Eddrup was successively chancellor of Salisbury Cathedral, principal of the Theological College, Salisbury (from 1861), and select preacher at Oxford (1871 to 1873). By 1861 he was the prebendary of the cathedral for Durnford. According to a newspaper account, on 3 April 1868 the Bishop of Salisbury, Dr Walter Kerr Hamilton, collated Eddrup "to the Briant and Emanuel Parsons", and he was Vicar of Bremhill from 1868 until his death.
On 12 August 1856, at St George's, Hanover Square, Eddrup married Helen Annette Campbell, the only daughter of Sir John Campbell, 2nd Baronet, and they went on to have six sons and three daughters: Edward Charles Paroissien, 1857, Helen Catherine Beatrix, 1858, Lucy Maud, 1860, Herbert Osmond Hamilton, 1862, Robert Arthur Campbell, 1863, Hermann Francis, 1865, Theodore Basil, 1868, Ella Grace Elizabeth, 1871, and Ernest Clement, 1873. Lucy Maud married Edward Stroud at Newton Abbott in 1884.
Eddrup's mother, Elizabeth Eddrup (1798–1874), and his wife Helen Annette Eddrup (1833–1887), are both buried in the churchyard at Bremhill and were joined there by Eddrup himself when he died in 1905.

Ion Fury

Ion Fury (originally titled "Ion Maiden") is a 2019 cyberpunk first-person shooter video game developed by Voidpoint and published by 3D Realms. It is a prequel to the 2016 video game "Bombshell". "Ion Fury" runs on a modified version of Ken Silverman's Build engine and is the first original commercial game to utilize the engine in 20 years, the previous being "World War II GI". An expansion to the game was announced on 28 December 2020 titled Ion Fury: Aftershock which is expected to release Summer 2021.
Plot.
In "Ion Fury", the player assumes the role of Shelly "Bombshell" Harrison, a bomb disposal expert aligned to the Global Defense Force. Dr. Jadus Heskel, a transhumanist cult leader, unleashes an army of cybernetically-enhanced soldiers on the futuristic dystopian city of Neo D.C., which Shelly is tasked with fighting through.
Development.
"Ion Fury" is built on "EDuke32", a fork of the Build engine which supports modern operating systems while also implementing a broader range of features. The source code of "Ion Fury" is part of the "EDuke32" source port.
Lawsuit.
In May 2019, it was announced that the band Iron Maiden would be suing 3D Realms for $2 million for "[the] misappropriation and use of a virtually identical imitation of the Iron Maiden trademark". 3D Realms quickly responded on Twitter, stating that these are "frivolous claims anyone who has played "Ion Maiden" would find more over the top than Shelly's 'Loverboy', her signature 18-round triple-barreled revolver".
The lawsuit claims that Ion Maiden "has the same look and feel" to the Android/iOS game "Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast" previously released on July 5, 2016. It also lists several alleged similarities, including the name "Ion Maiden", the font used for the game title, the main character Shelly 'Bombshell' Harrison and Steve Harris, the skull symbol, and the Eddie character. However, several of the allegedly similar elements cited in the lawsuit were present in a previous 3D Realms game, "Bombshell", released on January 29, 2016, including the main character name and the skull symbol. According to Scott Miller, founder of 3D Realms, "The name "Ion Maiden" comes from the basic weapon used by the same female hero in her first game, "Bombshell"."
On July 11, 2019, 3D Realms announced that the title of "Ion Maiden" was changed to "Ion Fury." Also announced was that voice actor Jon St. John, best known for the character Duke Nukem, was confirmed to be voicing the game's main villain.
Reception.
Critical reception.
"Ion Fury" received positive reviews with an averaging of 78 score on Metacritic.
IGN gave the game a score of 7.5/10, saying it "authentic throwback to "Duke Nukem 3D" that certainly hails to the king but can't quite dethrone him." PCGamesN's Chris Capel called it "probably the best Build engine game ever" and "challenging, funny, cleverly designed, and shockingly attractive." GameRevolution's Alex Santa Maria called it "an updated take on "Duke Nukem 3D" that goes above and beyond nostalgic pandering to become one of the better first-person shooters in recent memory." Game Informer's Javy Gwaltney called it "everything that I've wanted from a modernized take on the arcadey shooters of the 90s. The pitch-perfect movement, the enemy variety, creative weaponry, and fantastic level design all add up to a superb shooter campaign."
Awards.
"Ion Fury" won "Player's Choice Indie of the Year 2019" at IndieDB. The soundtrack won the "Outstanding Achievement for old school composing techniques" award at Game Audio Awards 2020.
Controversy.
On August 16, 2019, less than a day after the official release, Discord chat logs from members of Voidpoint were shared, displaying purportedly transphobic remarks by the developers. Following multiple requests for a comment on the situation by gaming news sites and retro gaming-focused YouTube personalities, Voidpoint and 3D Realms apologized and pledged to institute a zero-tolerance policy on "disparaging language". They also pledged to remove two lines of in-game text. Additionally, $10,000 of Ion Fury's initial sales were donated to the Trevor Project. 
The developer response yielded mixed reactions, including a considerable increase in negative reviews on the game's Steam page, many of which accused the developers of censorship. On August 26, 2019, the developers reversed their stance and stated that they would only remove one of the messages, containing a slur, but no other content. Polygon cited the increase in negative reviews as basis for the reversal. Voidpoint and 3D Realms issued a joint statement that they would not remove further content from "Ion Fury" or any future games, stating their opposition to the censorship of creative works of any kind.

<doc id="56716545" url="?curid=56716545" title="Texas Cart War">
Texas Cart War

The Texas Cart War was an outbreak of violence in 1857. Most of the violence occurred when American ox cart drivers attacked and hanged 70 Mexican ox cart drivers. The 'war' consisted of five attacks, three in July, one in September, and the last in November 1857. This attack involved Jose Huerta and Adalberto Davila. All of the attacks were on roads from San Antonio to Lavaca, Texas.
Background.
In the early-to mid 19th century Mexican cart drivers would charge rates that were lower than their white competitors to ship items from San Antonio, Texas, to the coast. Anglo shippers resented the competition. An attempted attack on Mexican cart drivers occurred in 1855, and there had been several other sporadic attacks by 1857. 
Attacks.
Sustained violence began on July 3, 1857, when a group of disguised men attacked six carts, and wounded six drivers in Goliad County, Texas. In the second attack, on July 14, around 20 Americans attacked carts near Goliad. There were no injuries or fatalities. In the third attack on July 31, three Mexicans were wounded, and one American who supported the Mexican cart drivers was killed. In September, the fourth attack saw Antonio Delgado, a prominent local politician, killed. Five men died in the third, and last, major attack. There were few efforts made to stop the attacks, and word spread of a "campaign of death" against Mexicans.
John Twiggs had, as a result of the frequent attacks, begun providing armed escorts with American government shipments. On October 14, Manuel Robles Pezuela, the Ambassador of Mexico to the United States, complained to the United States federal government, estimating at least 75 Mexicans had been killed in the attacks. The United States Secretary of State, Lewis Cass, urged Elisha M. Pease, the Governor of Texas, to take action to stop the attacks. Upon Pease's request, armed escorts began traveling with the carters and the war had ended by December.

Zhang Junsheng

Zhang Junsheng (; 1 July 1936 – 19 February 2018) was a Chinese optical engineer, politician, and academic administrator. He spent 25 years as an engineering professor at Zhejiang University and won two national science and technology awards, before entering politics and being sent to Hong Kong in 1985 to prepare for the British colony's return to China. During his tenure as Beijing's chief spokesman in Hong Kong, he fiercely clashed with Chris Patten, the last British governor in Hong Kong, over the latter's effort to implement political reforms over Beijing's objection. Their public dispute dominated news headlines in Hong Kong. After the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997, Zhang returned to Zhejiang University to serve as its Party Secretary. He oversaw the school's merger with three other universities and used his Hong Kong connections to raise funds for the university.
Early life and scientific career.
Zhang was born in 1936 in Changting County, Fujian Province. After graduating from high school in 1954, he was admitted to Zhejiang University (ZJU) in Hangzhou, where he studied optical engineering. At the university he met his future wife Yang Huiyi (), a student from Shanghai. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1956, and was hired by the university as a faculty member after his graduation in 1958.
In the 1960s, he and his colleagues designed a solar telescope. After the delay caused by the Cultural Revolution, it was put into production in the 1970s and won a National Science and Technology Prize (second class) in 1982. He co-founded the laser program at Zhejiang University in 1973 and won another National Science and Technology Prize (second class) for a solar spectrometer, for which he designed the mechanical components. He was promoted to party secretary of ZJU's Optical Engineering Department in 1978.
Career in Hong Kong.
In 1983, Zhang was appointed deputy party secretary of Hangzhou, beginning his political career. After the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, which announced that Great Britain would transfer sovereignty over Hong Kong to China on 1 July 1997, Zhang was assigned to the Hong Kong branch of the Xinhua News Agency, the "de facto" Chinese embassy in British Hong Kong, to work for the preparation of the handover. He served as deputy director, then director of the Hong Kong branch's publicity department, before being promoted to deputy director and spokesman of the branch in 1988.
When Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, attempted to implement political reforms prior to the handover, Zhang publicly feuded with Patten, and their dispute dominated news headlines in Hong Kong. Zhang accused Patten of violating the Sino-British agreement and called him "a prostitute who still wanted an arch to be erected to honour her as a chaste woman".
After Hong Kong.
After attending the Hong Hong handover ceremony on 1 July 1997, Zhang returned to Hangzhou. He was appointed Party Secretary of Zhejiang University and oversaw the merger of Hangzhou University, Zhejiang Agricultural University and Zhejiang Medical University into ZJU. He hired the famous writer Jin Yong as president of ZJU's Institute of Humanities, and used his connections to solicit major donations from Hong Kong businesspeople such as Run Run Shaw and Tin Ka Ping. In 2005, a number of alumni and other donors established the "Junsheng Scholarship" in his honour to sponsor students from poor families. As of 2018, the scholarship had a fund of 30 million yuan and had supported more than 2,300 students. He also taught as a part-time professor at Sun Yat-sen University, Communication University of China, in addition to Zhejiang University.
Views on democracy.
During the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Zhang was sympathetic toward the pro-democracy students. He reportedly gave the go-ahead for the "Wen Wei Po", Beijing's mouthpiece in Hong Kong, to publish an editorial with only four words: "deep grief" and "bitter hatred" after the government crackdown, but survived the ensuing purge of officials who supported political reform.
On the other hand, Zhang was critical of the localism movement in Hong Kong. He said the localist activists were too young to understand the history of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution, and advocated "national education" for students in Hong Kong. He dismissed the Occupy Central with Love and Peace movement in 2014 and criticized its pro-democracy leaders for having "never done anything good for Hong Kong".
Death.
On 19 February 2018, Zhang died in Hangzhou from cardiac arrest, at the age of 81. Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam expressed her sadness and praised Zhang's contributions to the establishment of the Hong Kong special administrative region. Chris Patten also gave his condolences. The "South China Morning Post", Hong Kong's major English-language newspaper, published an editorial calling Zhang "a good friend" of Hong Kong who "always had the city’s best interests at heart". Pro-establishment Hong Kong lawmakers Chan Yuen-han and Tam Yiu-chung praised Zhang as "learned", "open to different perspectives", and principled, whereas Cheung Man-kwong, former lawmaker of the Democratic Party, said "Zhang, representing Beijing, made very stern criticisms against the pan-democrats."

Body horror

Body horror or biological horror is a subgenre of horror that intentionally showcases grotesque or psychologically disturbing violations of the human body. These violations may manifest through aberrant sex, mutations, mutilation, zombification, gratuitous violence, disease, or unnatural movements of the body. Body horror was a description originally applied to an emerging subgenre of North American horror films, but has roots in early Gothic literature and has expanded to include other media.
Characteristics.
According to the film scholar Linda Williams, body horror falls into one of three "gross" genres or "genres of excess" which also includes pornography and melodrama. Williams writes that the success of these body genres "is often measured by the degree to which the audience sensation mimics what is seen on the screen". For example, an audience may experience feelings of terror through horror, sympathy through melodrama, or sexual arousal through pornography. Body horror specifically focuses on the limits and transformative capabilities of the human body.
Body horror often overlaps with, but is distinct from, other horror subgenres. For example, while elements of mutilation may be present in body horror, other similar subgenres such as slasher, splatter, or monster horror may also share this trope, but differ in message and intent. A common difference in the body horror genre is that violations or distortions of the body are rarely the result of immediate or initial violence. Instead, they are generally marked by a loss of conscious control over the body through mutation, disease, or other tropes involving uncontrolled transformation. The genre can invoke intense feelings of physical and psychological disgust, or squick, and play upon anxieties of physical vulnerability. In addition to common tropes used within the broader horror genre, some tropes specific to the body horror subgenre may include invasion, contagion, mutation, transformation, disease, mutilation, or other unnatural or violent distortions of the human body.
History.
The term "body horror" was first used by Phillip Brophy in his 1983 article "Horrality: The Textuality of the Contemporary Horror Film." He coined this term to describe an emerging subgenre which occurred during a short golden period for contemporary horror film. Although Brophy coined the term to specifically describe a trend within cinema, film director Stuart Gordon notes that the body horror trope had existed prior to its adaptation to the screen, most notably within fictional writing.
Fiction.
Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" (1818) is an early example of the body horror subgenre within fictional writing. The success of gothic horror in the 19th century in combination with the birth of science fiction as a literary form is thought to be the origin of body horror as a literary genre. According to Halberstam: "By focusing on the body as a locus of fear, Shelley's novel suggests that it is people (or at least bodies) who terrify people... the landscape of fear is replaced by sutured skin."
Film.
Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg is considered a principal originator of body horror through early films such as "Shivers" and "Rabid", and his remake of "The Fly". However, body horror tropes existed within film prior to official recognition of the genre. Early examples of the body horror genre arose out of 1950s American horror cinema including "The Blob" and "The Fly", both of which set the standard for the genre due to the films' primary focus on bodily mutilation and visceral special effects. Many contemporary films of the horror genre (those produced after 1968), including body horror, are considered to be postmodern in contrast to classical horror. Because of this, delineations between the genres are difficult to define, since postmodernism is concerned with blurring boundaries between categories.
The body horror genre is widely represented throughout Japanese horror and within contemporary media, such as anime. Katsuhiro Otomo's 1988 film "Akira" is an early example of body horror within anime. The film uses the genre to explore the "notion of the adolescent body as a site of metamorphosis, a metamorphosis that can appear monstrous both to the figure undergoing it and to the outside world."
Comics and graphic novels.
Many manga authors, such as Junji Ito, specialize in writing within the horror genre and use body horror tropes in combination with narrative storytelling devices of Japanese horror. Highly influenced by the literary works of H. P. Lovecraft, Ito's manga depict obscene body horror through both aesthetic and narrative in order to invoke feelings of abject terror. In contrast, Canadian cartoonist Michael DeForge incorporates recurring body horror aspects within his work through less graphic aesthetic and narrative styles.
Influences.
Films and media that fall under the body horror subgenre reflect a specific corporeal societal anxiety and may provide social commentary about history and influence contemporary culture.
Controversy and censorship.
Since the 18th century, the horror genre has been popular among readers but dismissed as controversial by critics who saw the genre and its thematic elements threatening or dangerous to society.
Owing to the use of graphic and gratuitous violence or themes that may be considered taboo, horror media that fall within the body horror genre are often censored or banned across a variety of countries. For example, the "Saw" and "Human Centipede" franchises have been referred to as "torture porn" and widely criticized to include overly "exploitative, gratuitous portrayals of destructive sexual perversion."

Lynn Eusan

Lynn Cecilia Eusan was the first black Homecoming queen at the University of Houston, where she studied journalism, and the first black woman to earn the title at any predominantly white college or university in the Southern United States. Only seven years earlier, UH had been an all-white institution, not integrating until the 1962–63 academic year. In 1971, less than three years after that Homecoming ceremony, she was found dead in the back of a stranger's car. Her death was believed to be a murder, and no one was ever found guilty for her death. A park at the university is named in her honor.
Personal life.
Eusan was born on October 11, 1948 in Galveston County, Texas. Her parents, Ida Mae (Boudreaux) Eusan and Wilbur Thirkield Eusan, Sr., were working class. Eusan and her four siblings grew up in San Antonio, Texas.
She graduated from Phillis Wheatley High School in 1966 and immediately enrolled at the University of Houston.
University of Houston.
At the University of Houston, Eusan was involved in the Spirit of Houston marching band and worked as a reporter and photojournalist. She majored in education and journalism.
She helped organize the Committee on Better Race Relations at UH, which aimed to "promote racial harmony among the students on the university’s campus." One year later, Eusan co-founded African Americans for Black Liberation, which replaced to COBRR. That organization was started with hopes to bring together other races and surrounding communities, including the surrounding Third Ward neighborhood and nearby historically black university Texas Southern University. The group also fund raised for scholarships and created summer programs for black youth. 
Eusan was a charter member of the Epsilon Lamba chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first black sorority at the university. She also co-founded SHAPE (Self Help for African People through Education) Community Center in the Third Ward.
On November 22, 1968, Eusan was crowned UH's Homecoming queen over five other white candidates in the Astrodome, becoming the first black homecoming queen at a white Southern university. The African Americans for Black Liberation ran her campaign. The Daily Cougar, the student newspaper, endorsed her candidacy. She continued to advocate for civil rights and black pride as Homecoming queen.
In the weeks leading up to the Homecoming game, Eusan received death threats and white fraternities mocked her in minstrel shows. Through the mocking, Eusan stayed positive. In an interview with the Houston Chronicle two weeks later, Eusan said, "This was the first time black students on the campus have banded together and really been effective against overwhelming odds."
In February 1969, Eusan and 100 other members of the AABL marched to UH President Phillip G. Hoffman's office and presented a list of 10 demands, which included:
Hoffman agreed to some of the group's demands. The same year, the University started the African-American studies program the AABL requested. 
Twice, Eusan was arrested for demonstrating. In 1969, she was charged with destruction of public property for her role in a riot on the UH campus. The charges were later dropped. In 1967, she was arrested during a demonstration for better conditions for children in the Sunnyside neighborhood.
Murder.
After graduating from UH in 1970, Eusan got a job reporting with Voice of Hope, the media arm of HOPE Development, Inc., in the Fifth Ward. She contributed to Black Enterprise magazine and worked as a secretary. Eusan planned to attend graduate school in North Carolina. The last time anyone saw Eusan was, she was waiting at a bus stop in windy, rainy weather on the evening of September 10, 1971. 
On September 10, 1971, a car driven by Leo Jackson, Jr. collided with a police vehicle. In the back seat, police found Eusan's body; she had been stabbed several times. Jackson claimed that Eusan had been "hysterical", assaulted him, and then stabbed herself, and that he was on his way to the hospital. 
Jackson had been arrested 14 times prior to the incident for charges including rape and armed robbery. Jackson was charged with Eusan's murder, but in 1972, a jury acquitted him. Since then, no one has been charged in connection with Eusan's death. 
Legacy.
Eusan was buried in the African American Cemetery on the east side of San Antonio. A public memorial service was held at UH.
The sorority Eusan helped charter, Alpha Kappa Alpha, is still active at the university.
The SHAPE Community Center is still active in the Third Ward. The center mobilized voters to elect Houston's first black mayor, organizes an annual Pan African Cultural Festival, and contributed to efforts to build the Third Ward Multi-Service Center.
Three years after Eusan's death, the University of Houston Board of Regents named a park in her honor, called the Lynn Eusan Park. Until the 1980s, the park was home to the university's live mascot, a cougar named Shasta, who resided in a cage. In 2013, the university built a modern stage for the park equipped with lights and a sound system. The park is a hub of student life and activity at the university.

The Book of Swindles

The Book of Swindles ("Piàn jīng" 騙經), also known by its longer title, "A New Book for Foiling Swindlers, Based on Worldly Experience" ("Jiānghú lìlǎn dùpiàn xīnshū" 江湖歷覽杜騙新書), is said to be the first Chinese short story collection about fraud. Written and compiled by Zhang Yingyu 張應俞, it was published in Fujian province in or around 1617, and most of its stories are set during the latter part of the Ming dynasty.
To each story the author adds a commentary that in some cases offers a moral lesson and in some cases shows appreciation for the artistry of the swindler, often praising the cleverness of the con and blaming its victim.
Modern editions have been entitled both "The Book Against Swindles" ("Fangpian jing") and "The Book of Swindles" ("Pian jing"). A selected English translation, "The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection", translated by Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk, was published by Columbia University Press in 2017.
Background and themes.
The first edition of 1617 has the full title "A New Book for Foiling Swindlers, Based on Worldly Experience" ("Jianghu lilan dupian xinshu"), suggesting that it is a guide to avoiding swindles and to negotiating the risky world of the traveling merchant, a life that an increasing number of people were leading in the growing commercial economy of the late Ming. It can just as well, however, be read as a guide to carrying out such scams oneself.
Types of swindle.
"The Book of Swindles" is divided into twenty-four categories of swindle:
Author.
Zhang Yingyu, style name Kui Zhong (夔衷), is an obscure figure. The "Book of Swindles" is the only known work to appear under his name, and no other records of him are known. A note on the title page of one Ming dynasty copy claims that he was from Zhejiang province, while a 1617 preface says that he was from Fujian.
Relationship with other literary works and genres.
The "Book of Swindles" incorporates elements from a variety of other Chinese genres, especially court case ("gong'an") fiction, in which a capable magistrate solves a crime. Stories involving sorcerers, Buddhist monks, and Daoist priests, who engage in alchemy or dream spirit possession, include motifs from supernatural tales. Other stories, featuring suspense, surprise and revelation, resemble jokes in structure. A minority include apocryphal anecdotes about historical figures.
Other works of fiction from the same time period, such as stories by Feng Menglong (1574–1645), Ling Mengchu (1580–1644), and Li Yu (1610–80), as wells as novels such as "The Water Margin" ("Shui hu zhuan") and "Plum in the Golden Vase" ("Jin ping mei"), feature accounts of similar scenarios of deception and trickery. Collections of swindle stories can also be found in contemporary China.

Jan Ceton

Jan Ceton (13 May 1875, Bodegraven – 21 January 1943, Amerongen) was a Dutch left-wing politician involved with both the Social Democratic Workers' Party and the Communist Party of the Netherlands. Ceton is best known as one of the founders of the Social Democratic Party, which later provided the core of the Communist Party of the Netherlands.
Background.
His father, Huijg Ceton, was descended from an English or Scottish soldier who had been stationed in Schoonhoven around 1620. His family were convinced they were descended from Huguenots and turned the name into 'Seton' or 'Ceton'. They traditionally worked as coppersmiths. His mother, Maria Sterk, came from a family of artisans and farmers. However Ceton's father broke with tradition becoming a teacher at the public primary school in Bodegraven. Ceton decided to follow his father into teaching. In September 1890 he enrolled as a student at the Dutch National School for Teachers in Haarlem. Although he was considered one of the best youngsters of his year he failed to get his teaching certificate as a primary school teacher in April 1894. In October he successfully retook the exams and started in January 1895 as a teacher at the public primary school in Alphen aan den Rijn. By studying in his spare time he gained full qualifications as of teacher in October 1898. Then on 1 June 1899 he was employed as a schoolteacher at School 130 Amsterdam, later Kastanjeplein school in Oosterparkbuurt.
Approach to pedagogy.
As a young teacher, Ceton opposed too strong an emphasis on book wisdom. He took the school children on long nature walks advocated this form of pedagogy during meetings of teachers from the Oude Rijn area. He wrote about butterflies for the magazine "De Levende Natuur" ("Living Nature") of Eli Heimans, Jasper Jaspers and Jac. P. Thijsse. This interest nature led him to resist the existing form of Christian education, and more generally the social relations in society. The Calvinist dominance in the local area led the municipalities to marginalize public primary education. His friend, C. Bijkerk, a teacher in Oudshoorn and later an activist with the Social Democratic Workers' Party, publicly campaigned against this in the local magazine "De Rijnbode", also exposing the deplorable social conditions of the working class. Ceton became departmental secretary of the Nederlandsch Onderwijzers Genootschap (Dutch Education Association).

Ahtanum Creek

Ahtanum Creek is a tributary of the Yakima River in the U.S. state of Washington. It starts at the confluence of the Middle and North Forks of Ahtanum Creek near Tampico, flows along the north base of Ahtanum Ridge, ends at the Yakima River near Union Gap and forms a portion of the northern boundary of the Yakama Indian Reservation. The name "Ahtanum" originates from the Sahaptin language, which was spoken by Native Americans in the region.
The North Fork enters the Middle Fork just upstream from its confluence with the South Fork. These three forks have sources in the Cascade Mountains. The creek has had several different official names since Europeans settled the region, all of which have been variant spellings of Ahtanum. The current spelling has been in place since 1916. Seasonal flooding associated with snow melting in the spring is common.
History.
Native Americans, including the Yakama Tribe inhabited the region surrounding Ahtanum Creek long before the arrival of Europeans. The band living along the creek, known as Ahtanumlema (″People of the water by the long hill″), were considered to be one of the more important groups within the tribe.
While the creek still lied within Oregon Territory, Catholic Fathers Louis D'herbomez and Charles Pandosy were sent to the area by François Norbert Blanchet, who was Bishop of the Archdiocese of Oregon City at the request of native leaders. Father Pandosy first served in missions near Richland and Ellensburg before constructing St. Joseph's Mission in 1852 with Father D'herbomez along Ahtanum Creek near what is now Tampico. This location was chosen because of its location within the main summer camp of Chief Kamiakin.
The missionaries and Yakamas worked together to build the first irrigation canals in the area. The relationship between the two groups was such that Kamiakin and others brought their children to the mission to be baptized. In 1854, Father D'herbomez was replaced by Father Pierre-Paul Durieu who would compile a dictionary of the Sahaptin language. The original mission was burned down in 1855 during the Yakima War by U.S. soldiers who believed the missionaries were conspiring with the Yakama Tribe. The mission was rebuilt in 1867.
Union Gap was established as Yakima City along Ahtanum Creek near its confluence with the Yakima River in the 1860s and became the county seat in 1870. In 1885, the Northern Pacific Railway established North Yakima (which later became Yakima) four miles north of present-day Union Gap because the railroad considered the then-current settlement to be too swampy and too close to nearby ridges. North Yakima was incorporated and became the county seat in 1886.
A wildfire burned near the North Fork of Ahtanum Creek in 2009.
Human use.
Water is pulled from Ahtanum Creek to irrigate of land upstream of the gauge in Union Gap. Fishing is popular along the creek, with fly fishing, baitcasting, spinning all being successful. The upper portion of the creek's watershed lies within Ahtanum State Forest, which is managed by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources. The forest has an area of that has numerous campgrounds. Seasonal hunting and snowmobiling are also popular.
Ecology.
Being located in the rain shadow of the Cascade Range, Ahtanum Creek has a riparian zone that serves as an important habitat for animals living in the region. Endangered species that utilize the creek include steelhead trout, bull trout, Chinook salmon, and coho salmon.
The Yakama Tribe completed a restoration project at La Salle High School. This project included strengthening three areas of the creek bank that were prone to erosion and reintroducing native plant species such as coyote willow. Along with this, two backwater channels were created and of soil were removed from the flood plain. These changes reconnected that stretch of the creek with its flood plain and provided areas for young fish to be reared. The North Yakima Conservation District installed fish screens on five water diversions between 2002 and 2006.

Murray David Maitland Keddie

Murray David Maitland Keddie (27 May 1929 – 18 February 2018), known as David Keddie, was a prominent Essex businessman, broadcaster, benefactor, magistrate, Deputy Lieutenant and High Sheriff of Essex in 1986.
Early life.
Keddie was educated at Summer Fields School, Summertown, Oxford, and Malvern College (at that time housed with Harrow School, as Malvern College was requisitioned by TRE for World War II effort). In the period 1947-51, whilst studying for the Bar, he served in the Inns of Court Regiment, part of the Territorial Force, and then served as a National Service Officer in the 10th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery until 1953. 
Business life.
In 1954, he joined Keddies, the family-owned department store in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, as a Director. He managed Keddies for 42 years until it ceased trading in 1996, due to the effect of competition from out-of-town centre shopping malls. During his time in charge he expanded Keddies into a small department store chain during the 60s and 70s.
Whilst at Keddies, in the early 1960s, he pioneered Supa-Save discount stores in Southend. With these he challenged the retail status quo and was instrumental in eventually abolishing the Retail Price Maintenance, or RPM (fixed supplier pricing, see Resale price maintenance), against legal and regulatory opposition. Following a number of injunctions, court cases, and joining forces with other retailers, the RPM was eventually abolished in 1964.
Public offices.
Keddie held a number of public offices over the years. In 1972, he was Senior Magistrate for the Southend Bench; in 1983, he was Deputy Lieutenant of Essex and, in 1985-86 he was appointed High Sheriff of Essex (the first holder of the title to come from South Essex). In 1986 he was President of the Essex Show, and continued as Director of the Essex Agricultural Society.
Broadcasting.
In 1981, after unsuccessfully lobbying the BBC to launch a local radio station in Essex, he founded Essex Radio (renamed Heart Essex (Chelmsford &amp; Southend)), and was its first Chairman until 1991
Architecture.
He was a proponent of the Modern Movement in Essex, commissioning architects Yorke, Rosenberg &amp; Mardall to design the family home, Ark House (1962) and redevelop the Keddies store in Southend (1960-64). The Keddies store was awarded a Civic Trust Award in 1963 and featured in Concrete Quarterly (1963)
Pro-bono.
He was also active in charitable, fundraising activities:

Cheng Xiaoqing

Cheng Xiaoqing was a Chinese detective fiction writer and foreign detective fiction translator. He is known for his Huo Sang series, in which the main character, Huo Sang, is considered to be "the Eastern Sherlock Holmes".
Early life.
Cheng Xiaoqing was born in a poverty-stricken family in Shanghai, China on August 2, 1893. Cheng was the eldest son and had two siblings, a younger brother and sister. Cheng’s father initially worked in a textile store which closed later, forcing him to sell newspapers in order to feed his family. He died in 1903 under great pressure when Cheng was only ten years old. Cheng' s mother was a seamstress and also worked hard to ensure her son is able to go to school. However, severe economic conditions forced Cheng to quit school when he was 15 to help his mother raising his younger sister.
Cheng moved to Suzhou with his family and his new bride in 1915 as he accepted a teaching position to teach Wu (the Shanghainese dialect). There, Cheng became acquainted with another foreign language teacher, who taught Cheng English.
Early career.
At the age of sixteen, Cheng became an apprentice in a watchmaker shop called Hope Brothers and Company in Shanghai, where he borrowed influential books and being taught horror and romance fictions in writing from a colleague. Aside from long working hours, Cheng spent a lot of time reading Chinese classics, writing short stories and buying old books during his time in the watchmaker shop, which has crucially influenced his later literary career according to a biographer he was closed to. 
Cheng took night classes to learn English, which allowed him to read foreign novels by writers like Henri René Albert Guy de Maupassant and Alexandre Dumas fils. Later, he came across Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" in the Shi Wu Bao Newspaper, which inspired him to write detective stories of his own.
Cheng Xiaoqing published his first detective story titled "The Shadow in the Lamplight" in "The Merry Magazine" in 1914. He later entered this piece in a Shanghai newspaper contest and won.
Later life.
In 1946, Cheng became the editor of detective magazine "The New Detective", but because of the lack of story sources, the magazine then shut down. After the publication was stopped, Cheng became a teacher working in The No.1 Middle School in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province.
Ten years later, Cheng began to write adventure fiction; for example, one of the most famous movies in 1958 called "The Case of Xu Qiuying" was created based on Cheng's fiction. However, during the period of Cultural Revolution, Cheng was criticized and denounced by the public, thus he had to stop writing.
He died of stomach illness in 1976 when he was 83 years old.
Works and accomplishments.
Literatures.
Cheng Xiaoqing is known as the "Grand Master of China's Detective Fiction" as well as the "Conan Doyle in Eastern World."
His first story "The Shadow in the Lamplight" (灯光人影) was published by "Shanghai Newspaper" when he was twenty-one years old and it was well received by its readership. Later, he started to publish more famous detective stories such as "Cat's Eye"; "The Shoe"; "The Other Paragraph"; "The Odd Tenant"; "The Examination Paper" and "On the Huangpu", which were all collected in the Huo Sang Series. Other detective works like "One Summer Night"; "At the Ball" and "The Ghost in the Villa" were published in different magazines.
In addition, Cheng Xiaoqing also wrote detective novels such as "The South-China Swallow" (Jiang Nanyan) and "Blood Fingerprint".
Movies.
Cheng Xiaoqing's literary creation was famous in the 1920s, but main movie activities began in the 1930s. In 1926, his novel "The Heart of the Mother" was edited by Chen Zhiqing into a screenplay, which is his works' first entry into the movie. Then in 1931, Cheng Xiaoqing officially started writing scripts for major movie companies.
It is clearly to be seen from the adaptation, Cheng Xiaoqing does not completely rewrite the novels; rather, he redesigned the plots based on film features and audience psychology in order to attract more viewers.

2018 Municipality of Anchorage, Alaska, Proposition 1

Proposition 1 was a 2018 direct initiative bathroom bill in Anchorage, Alaska. A public vote on the proposition was held on April 3, 2018. It would have made it legal for "any employer, public accommodation, or other person to establish and enforce sex-specific standards or policies concerning access to intimate facilities such as locker rooms, showers, changing rooms, and restrooms." The measure defined the term 'sex' as "an individual's immutable biological condition of being male or female, as objectively determined by anatomy and genetics at the time of birth." 
The proposition was the result of a petition campaign headed by Alaska Family Action, a Christian public policy organization. The group organized a petition titled "Regulating Access to Facilities Such as Locker Rooms and Bathrooms on the Basis of Sex at Birth, Rather Than Gender Identity." The Anchorage Municipal Clerk's Office certified over 6,200 valid signatures on the petition and authorized the referendum in July 2017. Local opponents of the bill were led by Fair Anchorage, a coalition of organizations.
Anchorage voters rejected Proposition 1 by a vote of 52.64% to 47.36%.

Zinn House

The Zinn House (), located at Kvæsthusgade 3, is a historic townhouse around the corner from the Nyhavn Canal in central Copenhagen, Denmark. It takes its name after the Zinn family, a wealthy family of merchants that owned it for more than 150 years. The composer Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann, who was married to Emma Sophie Amalie Zinn, a grand daughter of Johann Ludvig Zinn, lived on the second floor for more than 70 years in the period 1829–1900. The building was adapted in 1907. It was later in the century converted into offices. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1959.
History.
Oluf Blach.
The property was in 1689 part of a larger property (No. 21, St. Ann's East Quarter) owned by Nikolaj Veisling. It was built over with two storeys in 1751 for the merchant Oluf Blach (1694–1767). He had made a fortune on North Atlantic trade and would later serve as managing director of the General Trading Company. The property was 1756 as No. 39 still owned by Blach.
Zinn family.
The building was later acquired by another wealthy merchant, Johann Ludvig Zinn, who came to Denmark to work for Fabritius &amp; Wewer in 1757 and established his own trading house in 1765. His daughter, Sophie Dorthea Zinn, described everyday life in the building in her memoirs "Grandma' Confessions" ("Grandmamas Bekjendelser"). It is believed that the Zinn House was the first place in Denmark that the "La Marseillaise" was sung. It happened during a dinner for a delegation of French business partners on 20 January 1794 where Honoré-Nicolas-Marie Duveyrier was among the guests. Sophie Zinn persuaded him to sing the song, although "revolutionary songs" were highly controversial in Denmark at the time. Duveyrier sent her the score and lyrics the following day. Zinn was fond of music, and his home often played host to soirées.
Zinn's two sons, Carl Ludvig Zinn (1777–1808) and Johan Friedrich Zinn (1779–1838), took on the family's trading company after his death in 1802. Johann Friederich Zinn became the sole owner of the company when his elder brother died in 1808. He heightened the building in Kvæsthusgade with one floor in 1812. The company was later passed on to Johan Friedrich Zinn's son Ludvig Maximilian Zinn.
Johan Friedrich Zinn's daughter, Emma Sophie Amalie, married the composer Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann. The couple lived on the second floor. Hartmann served as organist at the nearby Garrison Church from 1724 to 1843 and thereafter in the cathedral. He stayed in the apartment after his wife's death and lived there until his own death in 1900. Other composers of the family lived there, in particular Emil Hartmann, but also at times Niels W. Gade and August Winding. Also composers Asger Hamerik and C.F.E. Horneman belonged to the Zinn family and lived for a while in the house.
The journalist , editor of the magazine "Fædrelandet", was a resident in the building from 1870 to circa 1874. The artist Johan Rohde lived in the building in 1903–04.
Later owners.
The Zinn House was in the 1900s purchased by Alfred Olsen &amp; Co., an oil company founded by Alfred and Ottho Olsen, in 1901, which had until then been based at Nyhavn 51. Otto Olsen died in 1906. The company prospered during World War I. Alfred Olsen commissioned the young architect Terkel Jhejle to refurbish the building in 1915. He purchased the estate Egebæksvang at Nærum in 1916 and commissioned Hjejle to expand the main building with a new wing. Olsen's wife, Olufa Olsen, née Bøjesen, died in 1917.
The company's name was changed to the Danish-American Gulf Oil Company in 1946.
Architecture.
The building consists of three floors over a high cellar and is 12 bays wide. The two oriel windows on the third floor date from the renovation in 1907. The original saddle roof was also replaced by a Mansard roof with eight dormers at this point.
Above the gateway is a plaque that commemorates that Hartmann lived in the building from 1829 to 1900. It also mentions that the Zinn family acquired the building in 1751 and that it was renovated in 1907.
The complex also comprises a side wing along the north side of a central courtyard and a rear wing. The building fronting the street was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1959 but the side wing and rear are not listed on 6 April 1959.
Today.
Thee building is now owned by Nordea Properties. They have converted the building from offices back to apartments with the assistance of Holsøe Arkitekter.

Newfoundland and Labrador Route 404

Route 404 is a short provincial highway on the west coast of Newfoundland in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is one of four provincial routes that start and end at the same route (in this case, the Trans-Canada Highway/Route 1) - the only other such provincial highways are Route 201, Route 213 and Route 351. When exiting the Trans-Canada Highway at the east access, the route starts several kilometers south of Robinsons and ends at the Trans-Canada Highway several kilometres south of Jeffrey's.
Route description.
Route 404 begins on Route 1 (TCH) in a very rural area and it heads through wooded terrain for several kilometres. It enters Jeffrey's, where it makes a sharp right at an intersection with a local road leading to St. David's and Maidstone. The highway now follows the coastline as it heads northeast through McKay's. Route 404 crosses the Barachois River to pass through Cartyville before crossing the Robinsons River into Robinsons. It passes through town, where it makes a sharp right at an intersection with a local road leading to Heatherton, before heading eastward through inland terrain for several kilometres to come to an end at another intersection with Route 1.

Uovo

Uovo Fine Art Storage (stylized as UOVO) is a New York City-based art storage space provider that specializes in safeguarding high-value fine art, fashion, interior design, and archival collections.. The company operates three facilities in the New York City area and stored in its facilities are numerous notable works of art and memorabilia from the fine art, music, entertainment and fashion industries.
History.
Uovo was established in January 2013 by Steven Guttman, an art collector and real-estate developer, and Steve Novenstein. The company is named after "uovo", the Italian word for egg. In 2006, Guttman opened his first fine art storage facility in the Bronx, New York on the top two floors of a building owned by his other business, Storage Deluxe. Guttman founded Uovo because he felt the demand for art storage far exceeded the capacity at the Bronx facility, and because he believed he could improve on existing art-storage options with a facility purpose-built to receive and protect fine art.
In early 2013, Uovo announced that it would build its first purpose-built art storage facility in Long Island City, Queens. The pair of buildings on 22nd Street which make up the 280,000-square-foot facility near Queens Plaza opened in 2014. The facility built from the ground-up features about 500 storage spaces and private viewing rooms, strict security, as well as advanced cataloging and indexing. The company offers suites customized for individual collections, workspaces for curators and conservators, as well as specialized transportation services for artwork.
In December 2014, Uovo purchased a warehouse facility in Orangeburg, New York. The 106,141-square-foot facility located at 33 Kings Highway sits on a thirteen-acre lot. In February 2017, the company opened its third facility, the second in Rockland County. The renovated 140,000-square-feet facility sits on a 9-acre property located at 100 Bradley Parkway in Blauvelt, a subdivision of Orangetown, New York.
As of 2015, Steve Novenstein serves as chief executive of Uovo. Guttman, the founder of the company, serves as chairman. A notable client is the Rubin Museum of Art in New York which utilizes Uovo’s facilities as an auxiliary storage space for its collections. Although Uovo does not often disclose the items stored in its facilities, but as of 2016, one large collection known to be stored there is the works of the fashion designer Oscar de la Renta. Designs spanning decades of work are housed, cataloged and sometimes showcased at Uovo, allowing archivist of De la Renta’s work to access and peruse the collection when necessary. Uovo also stores the collections of others in the fashion industry such as Hamish Bowles and PVH Corp., which owns Calvin Klein Inc. and the Tommy Hilfiger Group. In 2018 Uovo acquired a building in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY for a 150,000 square foot facility.

Becoming (book)

Becoming is the memoir of former First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama, published in 2018. Described by the author as a deeply personal experience, the book talks about her roots and how she found her voice, as well as her time in the White House, her public health campaign, and her role as a mother. The book is published by Crown and was released in 24 languages. One million copies were donated to First Book, an American nonprofit organization which provides books to children.
It was the highest-selling book published in the United States in 2018, setting the record 15 days after its publication, with over two million copies sold.
Background.
The 448-page memoir was published on November 13, 2018. Barack Obama said Michelle had help from a ghostwriter. The "Observer" notes that "Becoming"’s acknowledgements section thanks a team of people involved in finishing the book.
Synopsis.
The book's 24 chapters (plus a preface and epilogue) are divided into three sections: Becoming Me, Becoming Us, and Becoming More.
The preface sets the stage for Michelle Obama's story to open by sketching a scene in her post-First Lady life. Becoming Me traces Obama's early life growing up on the South Side of Chicago with her parents - Fraser and Marian Robinson - in an upstairs apartment where she got her first piano lessons and learnt to be an independent girl under the nurturing care of her parents. There, Obama shared a bedroom with her brother Craig. The book continues through her education at Princeton University and Harvard Law School, to her early career as a lawyer at the law firm Sidley Austin, where she met Barack Obama. While this section talks considerably at length about Obama's Princeton experience and Sidley Austin, Harvard Law school's experiences are mentioned marginally by comparison.
Becoming Us departs from the beginning of the Obamas' romantic relationship and follows their marriage, and the beginning of his political career in the Illinois State Senate. This section also notes Obama's career "swerve" from corporate law to the non-profit realm as she continued to work while raising her daughters and speaking at political events, becoming gradually more involved in her husband's campaign. The book shares Obama's balance between her position as the first African American First Lady of the United States of America, her motherly duties, and marital commitments. The section ends with election night in 2008 when Barack Obama was elected President of the United States.
Becoming More takes the readers through Barack Obama's presidency, Michelle Obama's focus on her Let's Move campaign, and her role of "head mom in chief" to her two daughters - Malia and Sasha Obama, along with the other aspects of the Obama's life as first family. The Epilogue talks about the last day of Obamas in the White House which was also Donald Trump's inauguration ceremony and Michelle Obama's reflection on Optimism. She also expresses her lack of desire to ever run for office.
Book sales.
Total book sales, including hardcover, audio and e-books editions, sold around 725,000 copies in the United States and Canada during its first day, making it the second best-selling debut for any book in 2018. Bob Woodward's "" holds the record after selling around 900,000 copies during its first day. However, Barnes and Noble reported that "Becoming" surpassed "Fear" in first-week sales and had more first-week sales of any adult book since "Go Set a Watchman" in 2015. The book sold 1.4 million copies in its first week. After 15 days, the book became the best-selling book in the US for the year 2018.
By March 26, 2019, "Becoming" had sold 10 million copies. According to "The New York Times", as of November 2020 the book has "sold 14 million copies worldwide, including more than 8 million in the U.S. and Canada".
Reception.
The review aggregator website Book Marks reported that 18% of critics gave the book a "rave" review, while 73% of the critics expressed "positive" impressions, based on a sample of 22 reviews. It was an Oprah's Book Club 2.0 selection. The book was given over 42,000 ratings and over 41,000 reviews on Goodreads and received 4.55 out of 5 stars. Hannah Giogris, a writer from "The Atlantic", used the words "refreshing" and "striking" to describe the book.
In 2020, the audiobook edition won the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album and was named one of the top ten Amazing Audiobooks for Young Adults by the American Library Association.
Soundtrack.
American musician Questlove curated a soundtrack for the book, called "The Michelle Obama Musiaqualogy".
Tour.
In November 2018, Michelle Obama went on a national book tour conducted in arenas, often to sold-out crowds starting in Chicago at the United Center. Obama previewed the book and tour on Chicago's Windy City Live daytime television show at her alma mater Whitney M. Young Magnet High School on Chicago's Near West Side.
The initial tour included 12 venues in 10 cities, but expanded with its popularity; as of February 2019, another 21 cities had been added, including six in Europe and four in Canada.
Film.
In May 2020, a documentary film based on the book was released on Netflix, following Obama through her book tour. The documentary features footage of Obama's travels behind-the-scenes of the tour and clips of her interviews onstage with moderators including Oprah Winfrey and Stephen Colbert.

Sodium sulfosuccinate esters

Sodium sulfosuccinate esters are organic compounds with the formula NaO3SCH(CO2R')CH2CO2R where R and R' can be H or alkyl groups. They comprise a large class of surfactants and emulsifiers used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and cleaning agents. They are colorless salts. These materials can be further classified into monoesters (R' = H, R = alkyl) and diesters (R and R' = alkyl). 
Synthesis.
They are produced by treatment of maleic anhydride with alcohols. The resulting mono or diesters are then treated with sodium sulfite, which, concomitant with protonation, adds to the C=C bond.
Application.
A high volume example is sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate. This is perhaps best known as the laxative docusate, however its main use is as a surfactant for which it finds common use in personal-care and household-care products, often under the name Aerosol-OTs. It is unusual in that it is able to form microemulsions without the use of co-surfactants, and it has a rich variety of aqueous-phase behavior including multiple liquid crystalline phases.

Irlam (1800 ship)

Irlam was launched in 1800 at Liverpool as a West Indiaman, sailing between Liverpool and Barbados. Although a merchantman not a privateer, she made an unusually aggressive use of her letter of marque, capturing or recapturing four vessels.
She wrecked on Tuskar Rock in 1812.
Career.
"Irlam" appears in the 1801 volume of "Lloyd's Register" with R. Ramsey, master, Irlam &amp; Co., owners, and trade Liverpool−Barbados. Captain Robert Ramsey acquired a letter of marque on 24 January 1801.
After the war with France resumed in 1803 Ramsey again acquired a letter of marque, this time on 26 May. "Lloyd's List" reported on 21 October 1803 that "Irlam" had arrived at Liverpool. She had left Barbados on 31 August. On her way home she had captured "Adolphus", from Mauritius, and sent her into Cork.
On 15 December Captain George Heygar (or Keyser) acquired a letter of marque.
On 10 March 1804 "Irlam", Captain Keyzar, was at Demerara. Before she sailed again, Barton, Irlam, and Higginson put an advertisement in the "Liverpool Chronicle" stating that "Irlam", of 24 guns, 9- and 18-pounders, and upwards of 50 men, was preparing to sail end-October. The advertisement further stated that she "carries letters of marque, with liberties to chace, capture, and man prizes".
On 14 January 1806 "Lloyd's List" reported that "Irlam", Keyser, master, and bound for Barbados, had to put back into Liverpool after having sustained damage in a gale. Several other vessels also had to put back, and one or two were lost.
"Irlam" and , also owned by Barton &amp; Co., left Barbados on 12 March 1808 and were reported on 22 April to have arrived at Liverpool.
"Lloyd's List" reported on 21 March 1809 that "Irlam" had arrived at Liverpool. On her way home she had captured a French brig with 300 hogsheads of sugar. "Irlam" had parted from her prize on 17 March.
On 10 March 1809, the brig "Batavia", Falliates, master, arrived at New York. On 16 January the sloop-of-war captured her and sent her for Plymouth. However, on 17 January "Batavia"s crew recaptured her. Then on 26 February "Irlam" captured her. On 8 March, "Batavia"s captain, cook, and steward again recaptured her. (An earlier report had credited with the first capture of "Batavia", and did not mention her crew recapturing her a second time.)
On 7 May 1810, "Irlam" recaptured "Nelly", late Wilson, master. "Nelly" had been captured on 5 May as she was sailing from St Kitts to Liverpool. She reached Liverpool on 24 May.
The "Register of Shipping" for 1812 showed "Irlam" with Keyzor, master, Barton &amp; Co., owners, and trade Liverpool–Barbados.
Loss.
On 10 May 1812, "Irlam" was coming from Barbados and sailing towards Liverpool with a cargo of sugar and cotton, under the command of Captain Keyzar. She was also carrying passengers: Captain Hall of the 16th Regiment of Foot, ten more officers, 62 rank and file, and 32 women and children. She was sailing in thick haze when she wrecked on Tuskar Rock.
All of those aboard were able to ascend the rock with the help of workmen who were providentially there to build a lighthouse. They used ropes to haul all up the rock face, and brought the children and infants up in bags. The brig "Sarah" arrived and with her boats was able to retrieve most of the passengers and crew. Adverse winds forced her to deliver the people she had rescued to Beaumaris on 12 May. Still, three army officers, sixteen privates, a woman, the mate, and twelve sailors had to wait on the rock until a second brig arrived on the 12th and took them to Wexford. "Lloyd's List" ("LL") reported that a woman, two children, and a crew man had been drowned.

Athena with cross-strapped aegis

The Athena with cross-strapped aegis is an ancient statue of the Greek goddess Athena, which was made around AD 150 and is now displayed in the Antikensammlung Berlin (Inventory number AvP VII 22).
The statue was found in 1880 during Carl Humann's excavations of Pergamon in the space to the west of the north stoa of the sanctuary of Athena, near the Lady of Pergamon. This area may have been the art collection ("museion") of the Attalid kings. When the statue was found, there were still traces of paint on it: the aegis had parts in light and dark blue, the snakes were red, and there were other bits of colour on the hem. These traces of colour can no longer be perceived, except for a painted band on the soles of her shoes. The statue is largely intact, except for the right arm and one fold of her drapery. The left arm has been reconstructed from a number of fragments. The head was only found several months after the body and was more heavily corroded than the rest of the statue. It was made separately and inserted into the main statue. The head was looted by the Russians and is now lost; a plaster cast sits in its place.
Athena wears a girdled Doric peplos, which leaves her arms free and falls to her hips. Especially on the right hand side, it is characterised by elegant flowing folds. The unusual, cross-strapped form of the aegis is the source of the statue's common name. It is formed of two separate strips which run under the arms and cross in front of the bosom and in the same space at the back. These strips are probably meant to imitate the design of furs. On the lower edge of the strips of the aegis there are small curves, from which small serpents emerge. These are partially carved in free relief, and are shown winding around themselves, tying themselves into knots, and striking out. Where the aegis crosses, there is a Gorgoneion, which turns away evil, depicted as a brooch. Her hair falls in gentle locks. It is tied back from the face and held in a bun at the back of the head. From the surviving top portion of the missing right arm, it is clear that it must have been bent. Since the head is also turned slightly to the right and downwards, it has been suggested that the goddess held a small Nike or a lance in her hand. Her left hand might have held a lance or perhaps a helmet (vehemently denied by many archaeologists).
The statue follows classical models of around 430/20 BC, but it was actually made in the Hellenistic period, around 150 BC, and lacks the self-centred harmony and calm of its models. The posture of the head and right arm in connection with the placement of the weight-bearing right leg further to the rear suggest a jerky movement. The left leg is bent, with the knee extending further forward. The way her clothing sits also suggests a tense restlessness. In composition and execution, the statue blends the classical model with the new ideas of the Hellenistic age. Aspects of her clothing seem to derive from the Great frieze of the Pergamon altar. There is also a connection to the Statue of Athena, which Myron made on Samos and which many archaeologists have wished to see this as a copy of.

Lotus glaucus

Lotus glaucus is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae, native to Madeira and the Salvage Islands. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with leaves made up of five leaflets. Its flowers are usually orange on opening. "Lotus tenellus" is included in a more broadly circumscribed "L. glaucus" by some authors, which extends its distribution to the Canary Islands.
Description.
"Lotus glaucus" is a perennial herbaceous plant, usually forming dense mats, but sometimes somewhat shrubby. The leaves are unstalked (sessile) with five pinnate leaflets. In "L. glaucus" subsp. "glaucus", the two basal leaflets are 1.5–4.5 mm long; a short axis (rhachis), up to 2 mm long, separates the basal leaflets from the other three leaflets, which are 2–8 mm long, longer than the basal leaflets. The leaflets of "L. glaucus" subsp. "salvagensis" are generally longer, up to 13 mm. The stems and leaves have straight hairs which lie flat along the surface. The density of these hairs varies; some plants have dense hairs and appear silvery, others have fewer hairs and are greener. The flowers are arranged in umbels, usually with one to three flowers per umbel, occasionally up to five. The petals are initially orange to reddish, sometimes deep yellow, turning reddish-brown after fertilization. The upper petal (the standard) is shorter than or as long as the keel petals, which are 10–15 mm long. The wing petals are 9–14 mm long, usually shorter than the keel. The fruit pods are straight.
Taxonomy.
"Lotus glaucus" was first described in volume 3 of the first edition of "Hortus Kewensis", dated to 1789. The title page gives the author of the work as William Aiton, although it is generally agreed that the descriptions were written by Daniel Solander or Jonas Carlsson Dryander. Some sources ascribe the name "Lotus glaucus" to Solander or to Dryander. However, the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, at Article 46.8, Example 37, explicitly states that the names in this edition of "Hortus Kewensis" are to be attributed to Aiton.
"Lotus glaucus" is placed in "Lotus" section "Pedrosia", sometimes recognized as a subgenus or as a separate genus. The taxonomy of the species placed in this section is described as "problematic". "L. glaucus" belongs to a group that can be divided into different numbers of species. In 2006, Sandral et al. accepted three species – "L. glaucus", "L. tenellus" and "L. dumetorum" – while noting that it was equally possible to treat "L. glaucus" as including the other two species. Other sources accept two species, sinking "L. tenellus" into "L. glaucus", but recognizing "L. dumetorum".
Subspecies.
Sandral et al. recognize two subspecies:
They also examined specimens from Fuerteventura, which may belong to the same species, possibly as an additional subspecies. However, they noted that "it is difficult to make a precise decision on its taxonomic identity".
Distribution and habitat.
"Lotus glaucus" sensu stricto is native to Madeira (subsp. "glaucus") and the Salvage or Savage Islands (subsp. "salvagensis"), and possibly also Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands if specimens collected from there belong to this species. When "L. tenellus" is included in "L. glaucus", its distribution is extended to the coastal zone of Tenerife and Gran Canaria.

Good Epidemiological Practices

Good Epidemiological Practices or Good Epidemiology Practices (GEP) was a set of guidelines produced by the U.S. Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) in 1991 to improve epidemiologic research practices. It was then adopted by the tobacco industry around 1993 as part of its "sound science" program to counter criticisms of the industry on health and environmental issues such as secondhand smoke. It failed to make much impact on the US and European regulators, but may have had more influence in its later manifestations in Asia and particularly China.
The complexities of creating Good Epidemiological Practices developments have been examined by University of San Francisco researchers Stanton Glantz and Elisa K. Ong in papers such as "Tobacco Industry Efforts to Subvert the IARC's Second hand smoke study" published in "The Lancet". They argued that these were industry programs designed to manipulate the scientific standards of proof, and an attempt to set risk-evaluation standards that could be forced through by legislation, and imposed on the agencies (EPA, OSHA, etc.) to hamstring the agencies' ability to regulate.
Tobacco's GEP.
In February 1993, an executive of Philip Morris USA, Ellen Merlo, wrote a memo to her CEO William Campbell outlining their strategies to discredit the 1992 report by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that identified secondhand smoke as a Group A human carcinogen, and to counter what she described as "junk science". Their public relations firm, APCO Associates, launched a "sound science" coalition in the United States, and The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition (TASSC) was formed three months later in May 1993, with Garrey Carruthers the chairman. George L. Carlo, a science entrepreneur who worked with Federal Focus Inc., prepared one of the early draft documents.
At this time the legislative and public activist attacks on the tobacco industry had escalated, and they blamed this on the "twisted science" used by the EPA. In Europe the UN's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) was about to release a similar report, which the tobacco industry also needed to counter.
Helmut Reif, Tom Borelli and Mitch Ritter at Philip Morris's Science &amp; Technology division thought the CMA's GEP could be improved to help PM develop standards for secondhand smoke epidemiological studies. This initiative to "constructively improve" epidemiology would enlist the assistance of the industry's consultants, and they could then run an "offensive strategy"—essentially another proactive effort by the industry to shape the scientific process.
Joanna Sullivan, Philip Morris's main PR in Europe, advised her American superiors (June 1994) on how GEP might be used to combat the IARC's report, since this would give United Nations weight to the claim that second-hand smoke was potentially cancerous to non-smokers. By establishing the standards of epidemiology and by using their influence in Congress to have GEP mandated by legislation, they hoped to design a set of established procedural standards for epidemiology.
The innovation here, was that they aimed to attack the techniques relied on by the EPA and IARC scientists. In the past, they had focussed attacks on specific adverse scientific findings and reports. GEP was designed to directed an attack on the techniques of epidemiology itself.
They may have had little hope that this would be widely accepted by the majority of epidemiologists or by the regulators, but it made possible a vigorous public relations campaign in the media to challenge and denigrate any adverse findings.
Panels and Conferences.
Initially Philip Morris utilised a small panel of trusted epidemiologists who regularly serviced the industry when it needed to defend against some adverse finding. They were requested to improve on the Chemical Manufacturer's Association's GEP. Later they extended this mandate by conducting seminars on GEP and good risk-assessment practice around the world. The tobacco industry itself needed to remain invisible and so they needed the front provided by third-party think-tanks and old allies.
The main organisation hired to run the GEP program was Federal Focus Inc., a PR company set up during the second term of the Reagan Administration by two top Agency officials, Thorne Auchter, who had been the Director of the OSHA (Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration) and James J. Tozzi who had been Reagan's "Deregulation Czar" as head of the OIRA (Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs), at the OMB (Office of Management &amp; Budget). These two and the head of the EPA (Anne Gorsuch Burford) were among the 20 or so top Agency executives forced (or encouraged) to resign over Reagan's regulatory scandals.
Jim Tozzi's technique at the OIRA was to block regulators from regulating by denying their agencies funding unless they cancelled one regulation before adding another. (Tozzi and Auchter also ran Multinational Business Services, and the Institute for Regulatory Policy).
The main tobacco law firm, Covington &amp; Burling (C&amp;B) was also involved both in promoting the idea and in recruiting scientists willing to participate, usually only when assured that payment would be laundered through the law firm. C&amp;B lawyer John Rupp initiated similar activities in Italy and Germany. The total expenses for this program in 1997 were about $300,000.
The GEP program "experts" that Auchter and Tozzi enlisted were pre-screened by Philip Morris Issues Managers and Federal Focus, and the results they produced were pre-tested at a number of conferences (which often didn't carry the GEP name). The first, known as the Lansdowne Conference, was held at a US conference center with only a few of their most trusted scientist helpers. They then widened the advisory pool and held a London Conference where Philip Morris opened the operation to British-American Tobacco and the other companies. They established what became known as the London Principles. A German conference soon followed.
Generally GEP failed to influence policy makers in America and Europe, so it was tried in Asia through conferences of the Asian WhiteCoats group (collectively known as 'ARTIST') and with other recruits in Kuala Lumpur, Hong-Kong, Yokohama, Beijing, and then Guangzhou.
The inadvertent whistleblower.
Ted Sanders, who ran the Scientific Affairs operations for Philip Morris in Europe, provides us with an excellent overview of how the Philip Morris GEP unravelled in a long letter of complaint to Cathy Ellis, his executive overseer in Brussels (Apr 3 1998).

Once Upon a Time in Hollywood

Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a 2019 British–American comedy-drama film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Produced by Columbia Pictures, Bona Film Group, Heyday Films, and Visiona Romantica and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it is a co-production between the United States, United Kingdom, and China. It features a large ensemble cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie. Set in 1969 Los Angeles, the film follows a fading actor and his stunt double as they navigate the rapidly changing film industry, with the looming threat of the Tate murders hanging overhead. It features "multiple storylines in a modern fairy tale tribute to the final moments of Hollywood's golden age."
Announced in July 2017, it is the first Tarantino film not to involve Bob and Harvey Weinstein, as Tarantino ended his partnership with the brothers following the sexual abuse allegations against the latter. After a bidding war, the film was distributed by Sony Pictures, which met Tarantino's demands including final cut privilege. Pitt, DiCaprio, Robbie, Zoë Bell, Kurt Russell, and others joined the cast between January and June 2018. Principal photography lasted from June through November around Los Angeles. This was the final film to feature Luke Perry, who died on March 4, 2019, and was dedicated to his memory.
"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival on May 21, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 26, 2019 and in the United Kingdom on August 14. The film has grossed $374 million worldwide and received praise from critics for Tarantino's direction and screenplay, the performances (particularly from DiCaprio and Pitt), cinematography, soundtrack, sound design, costume design, and production values. Among its various accolades, the film was chosen by the American Film Institute and the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of the year. It received 10 nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won Best Supporting Actor (Pitt) and Best Production Design. It also won Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor (Pitt) at the 77th Golden Globe Awards.
A novelization of the same name, written by Tarantino in his debut as an author, was published on June 29, 2021. A television series titled "Bounty Law", based on a TV program depicted in the film, is currently being developed by Tarantino.
Plot.
In February 1969, Hollywood actor Rick Dalton, the star of the 1950s Western television series "Bounty Law", fears his career is fading, as most of his recent roles have been guest appearances as villains. Casting director Marvin Schwarz advises him to make Spaghetti Westerns in Italy, which Dalton feels are beneath him. Dalton's best friend and stunt double, Cliff Booth — a war veteran who lives in a trailer with his pit bull, Brandy — drives Dalton around because the latter's driver's license has been suspended due to DUI arrests. Booth struggles to find stunt work because of rumors he murdered his wife. Actress Sharon Tate and her husband, director Roman Polanski, have moved next door to Dalton, who dreams of befriending them to revive his career. That night, Tate and Polanski attend a celebrity-filled party at the Playboy Mansion.
The next day, Booth reminisces about a sparring contest he had with Bruce Lee on the set of "The Green Hornet" resulting in Booth being fired. Meanwhile, Charlie stops by the Polanski residence looking for Terry Melcher, who used to live there, but is turned away by Jay Sebring. As Tate runs errands, she stops at the Fox Bruin Theater to watch herself in "The Wrecking Crew".
Dalton is cast to play the villain in the pilot of Western television series "Lancer" and strikes up a conversation with eight-year-old co-star Trudi Frazer. During filming, Dalton struggles to remember his lines and suffers a breakdown in his trailer as a result. He subsequently delivers a strong performance that impresses Frazer and the director, Sam Wanamaker.
Booth picks up a female hitchhiker, "Pussycat" and takes her to Spahn Ranch, where he once worked on the set of "Bounty Law." He takes notice of the many "hippies" living there. Suspecting they may be taking advantage of the ranch's owner, George Spahn, Booth insists on checking on him despite "Squeaky"'s objections. Booth speaks with the now nearly-blind Spahn, who dismisses his concerns. Upon leaving, Booth discovers that "Clem" has punctured a tire on Dalton's car, so Booth beats "Clem" up and forces him to change the tire. "Tex" is summoned to deal with the situation, but arrives as Booth is driving away.
After watching Dalton's guest performance on an episode of "The F.B.I.", Schwarz books him as the lead in Sergio Corbucci's Spaghetti Western "Nebraska Jim". Dalton takes Booth with him for a six-month stint in Italy, during which he films three additional movies, and marries Italian starlet Francesca Capucci. Dalton informs Booth he can no longer afford his services.
On the evening of August 8, 1969, their first day back in Los Angeles, Dalton and Booth go out for drinks to commemorate their time together, then return to Dalton's house. Meanwhile, Tate and Sebring go out for dinner with friends, then return to Tate's house. Booth smokes an LSD-laced cigarette purchased earlier and takes Brandy for a walk while Dalton prepares drinks. Manson Family members "Tex", "Sadie", "Katie", and "Flowerchild" arrive outside in preparation to murder everyone in Tate's house, but Dalton hears their muffler and orders them off the street. Recognizing him, the Family members change their plans and decide to kill him instead, after "Sadie" reasons that Hollywood has "taught them to murder". "Flowerchild" deserts them, speeding off with their car. Breaking into Dalton's house, they confront Capucci and Booth. Booth recognizes them from Spahn Ranch and orders Brandy to attack. Together they kill "Tex" and injure "Sadie", though Booth is stabbed in the thigh and passes out after killing "Katie". "Sadie" stumbles outside, alarming Dalton, who was in his pool listening to music on headphones, oblivious to the melee inside. Dalton retrieves a flamethrower previously used in a movie and incinerates "Sadie". After Booth is taken away in an ambulance to receive treatment, Sebring and Tate invite Dalton over for a drink, which he accepts.

Production.
Writing and development.
The screenplay for "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" was developed slowly over several years by Tarantino. While he knew he wanted it to be titled "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood", evoking the idea of a fairy tale, he publicly referred to the project as "Magnum opus". The life of the work for the first five years was as a novel, which Tarantino considered to be an exploratory approach to the story, not yet having decided if it would be a screenplay. Tarantino tried other writing approaches: the early scene between Rick Dalton and Marvin Schwarz was originally written as a one-act play.
Tarantino discovered the centerpiece for the work about 10 years previously while filming "Death Proof" with Kurt Russell who had been working with the same stunt double, John Casino for several years. Even though there was only a small bit for Casino to do, Tarantino was asked to use him, and agreed. The relationship fascinated Tarantino and inspired him to make a film about Hollywood. Tarantino stated, while Casino may have been a perfect double for Russell years earlier, when he met them, "this was maybe the last or second-to-last thing they'd be doing together".
Tarantino first created stuntman Cliff Booth, giving him a massive backstory. Next, he created actor Rick Dalton for whom Booth would stunt double. Tarantino decided to have them be Sharon Tate's next-door neighbors in 1969. The first plot point he developed was the ending, moving backwards from there, this being the first time Tarantino had worked this way. He thought of doing an Elmore Leonard-type story, but realized he was confident enough in his characters to let them drive the film and let it be a day in the life of Booth, Dalton, and Tate. He would use sequences from Dalton's films for the action, inspired by Richard Rush's "The Stunt Man", which used the scenes from the WWI movie they were making within the film as the action. Further, to get his mind into Dalton, Tarantino wrote five episodes of the fictional television show "Bounty Law", in which Dalton had starred, having become fascinated with the amount of story crammed into half-hour episodes of 1950s western shows.
Tarantino kept the only copy of the third act of the script in a safe to prevent it from being prematurely released. DiCaprio and Pitt were the only two other people who read the entire script. In an interview with Adam Sandler, Pitt revealed that the only other copy of the script was burned by Tarantino.
Pre-production and casting.
On July 11, 2017, it was announced that Quentin Tarantino's next film would be about the Manson murders. Harvey and Bob Weinstein would be involved, but it was not known whether The Weinstein Company would distribute the film, as Tarantino sought to cast before sending a package to studios. Tarantino approached Brad Pitt to star. It was reported that Margot Robbie was being considered for Sharon Tate. It was also reported that Pitt was in talks for the detective investigating the murders.
After the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations, Tarantino cut ties and sought a new distributor, after having worked with Weinstein for his entire career. At this point, Leonardo DiCaprio was revealed to be among a short list of actors Tarantino was considering. A short time later, reports circulated that studios were bidding for the film, and that David Heyman had joined as a producer, along with Tarantino and Shannon McIntosh.
On November 11, 2017, Sony Pictures announced they would distribute the film, beating Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Annapurna Pictures and Lionsgate. Tarantino's demands included a $95 million budget, final cut privilege, "extraordinary creative controls", 25% of first-dollar gross, and the stipulation that the rights revert to him after 10 to 20 years.
In January 2018, DiCaprio signed on, taking a pay cut to collaborate with Tarantino again. Al Pacino was being considered for a role. On February 28, 2018, the film was titled "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood", with Pitt cast as Cliff Booth. DiCaprio and Pitt were each paid $10 million. In March 2018, Robbie, who had expressed interest in working with Tarantino, signed to co-star as Sharon Tate, while Zoë Bell confirmed she would appear. In May 2018, Tim Roth, Kurt Russell, and Michael Madsen joined the cast. Timothy Olyphant was also cast. In June 2018, Damian Lewis, Luke Perry, Emile Hirsch, Dakota Fanning, Clifton Collins Jr., Keith Jefferson, Nicholas Hammond, Pacino, and Scoot McNairy joined the cast. Spencer Garrett, James Remar, and Mike Moh were announced in July. In August 2018, Damon Herriman as Charles Manson, and Lena Dunham, Austin Butler, Danny Strong, Rafał Zawierucha, Rumer Willis, Dreama Walker, and Margaret Qualley were cast.
When Butler auditioned for the film, he was not aware of which character he was being considered for. Tarantino told him it was for a villain or a hero on "Lancer", when in fact it was for Tex Watson. To prepare for her audition, Maya Hawke practiced with her father, Ethan Hawke. She stated, "He (Tarantino) actually organized a really amazing callback process that was unlike anything I've ever been through... except maybe auditioning for drama school." Willis auditioned for two roles, neither of which she got, but was later offered the part of Joanna Pettet. Sydney Sweeney said everyone she auditioned with did so for the same character, then were told they could do extra credit. Some did artwork, and she wrote a letter in character. Julia Butters says her sitcom "American Housewife" was on while Tarantino was writing her character, Trudi Frazer. He looked up and said, "Maybe she can try this."
In May 2018 Burt Reynolds was cast as George Spahn, but died in September before filming his scenes and was replaced by Bruce Dern. Reynolds did a rehearsal and script reading, his last performance. After reading the script and learning that Pitt would be portraying Booth, Reynolds told Tarantino, "You gotta have somebody say, 'You're pretty for a stunt guy.'" The line appears in the film, spoken to Booth by Bruce Lee. The last thing Reynolds did before he died was run lines with his assistant for "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood".
Tarantino initially approached Jennifer Lawrence to portray Manson Family member Squeaky Fromme, saying "She was interested but something just didn't work out." Tarantino had also spoken to Tom Cruise about playing Cliff Booth, who was being considered for the role. Charlie Day was the producers' first choice to play Manson. Day did not show up to interview for the part because he did not want to see himself in that role. Macaulay Culkin auditioned for an undisclosed role. It was his first audition in eight years. It was also initially reported that Samuel L. Jackson was in talks for a major role.
Filming and design.
Principal photography began on June 18, 2018, in Los Angeles, California, and wrapped on November 1, 2018. Tarantino's directive was to turn Los Angeles of 2018 into Los Angeles of 1969 without computer-generated imagery. For this, he tapped into previous collaborators for production: editor Fred Raskin, cinematographer Robert Richardson, sound editor Wylie Stateman and makeup artist Heba Thorisdottir. He also brought first-time collaborators, production designer Barbara Ling, based on her work recreating historical settings in "The Doors", and costume designer Arianne Phillips. Despite Tarantino's intent, the production wound up using more than 75 digital visual effects shots by Luma Pictures and Lola VFX, mainly to cover up modern billboards and erasing non-1960s buildings from driving shots.
To film at the Pussycat Theater, production designer Barbara Ling and her team covered the building's LED signage and reattached the theater's iconic logo, rebuilding the letters and neon. Ling said the lettering on every marquee in the film is historically accurate. To restore Larry Edmund's Bookshop, she reproduced the original storefront sign and tracked down period-appropriate merchandise, even recreating book covers. Her team restored the Bruin and Fox Village theaters, including their marquees, and the storefronts around them. Stan's Donuts, across the street from the Bruin, got a complete makeover.
The Playboy Mansion scene was shot at the actual mansion. Tarantino was adamant about filming there, but it took a long time to obtain permission since the mansion had been sold to a private owner following Hugh Hefner's death. Tarantino and Ling met with the new owner to discuss the parts they wanted to use, but he was reluctant since the property was in the middle of a renovation. After long negotiations he agreed, and Ling was able to dress the vacant mansion, front courtyard, and backyard for the party scene, evoking as much of the 1960s appearance of the mansion as possible. The dance sequence for the scene was choreographed by Toni Basil who knew Sharon Tate and once dated Jay Sebring. She also choreographed Dalton's "Hullabaloo" scene.
The scenes involving the Tate-Polanski house were not filmed at Cielo Drive, the winding street where the 3,200 square-foot house once stood. The house was razed in 1994 and replaced with a mansion nearly six times the size. Scenes involving the house were filmed at three different locations around Los Angeles: one for the interior, one for the exterior, and a Universal City location for the scenes depicting the iconic cul-de-sac driveway.
Movie poster artist Steven Chorney created the poster for "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" as a reference to "The Mod Squad". He also created the posters for the movies within the film, "Nebraska Jim", "Operation Dyn-O-Mite", "Uccidimi Subito Ringo Disse il Gringo", "Hell-Fire Texas", and "Comanche Uprising", which was reprinted for Dalton's home parking spot. "Mad" magazine caricaturist Tom Richmond created the covers of "Mad" and "TV Guide" featuring Dalton's Jake Cahill.
Tarantino told Richardson, "I want [it] to feel retro but I want [it] to be contemporary." Richardson shot in Kodak 35mm with Panavision cameras and lenses, in order to weave time periods. For "Bounty Law" they shot in black and white, and brief sequences in Super 8 and 16mm Ektachrome. In the film, "Lancer" was shot on a retrofitted Western Street backlot at Universal Studios, designed by Ling. Richardson crossed "Lancer" with "Alias Smith and Jones" for the retro-future look Tarantino wanted. The way they filmed "Lancer" was not possible in 1969, but Tarantino wanted his personal touch on it. Richardson said that filming the movie touched him personally, "The film speaks to all of us... We are all fragile beings with a limited time to achieve whatever it is we desire... that at any moment that place will shift... So take stock in life and have the courage to believe in yourself." In order to build the "Lancer" set Ling watched "Enormous amounts of episodes" of the series. She built a western town filled with adobe buildings. For "Bounty Law", she went for a dusty, dirty, early "Deadwood" look, to separate it from the "Moneyed "Lancer" world".
Spahn Ranch was recreated in detail over about a three-month period. A wildfire completely destroyed the ranch in 1970 so the scenes for the movie were filmed at nearby Corriganville Movie Ranch in Simi Valley, which was also a movie ranch at one time. Tarantino made sure to use a lot of dogs in the scenes. He said in real life many dogs lived on the ranch and it made it feel alive. He even made sure there were dogs moving around in every shot. He was inspired to use the dogs in this manner from the way Francis Ford Coppola used helicopters in "Apocalypse Now" during the Robert Duvall scenes.
To improve the use of practical effects, Leonardo DiCaprio was allowed to light stunt coordinators on fire while shooting scenes with a flamethrower. The exterior of the Van Nuys Drive-in theater scene was filmed at the Paramount Drive-in theater since the Van Nuys Drive-in theater no longer exists. As the camera rises up over the theater, the shot transitions to a miniature set with toy cars. For some of the driving scenes, Los Angeles freeways were shut down for hours in order to fill them with vintage cars. The scene depicting Bruce Lee training Jay Sebring was filmed at Sebring's actual house.
The scene in which Rick Dalton flubs his lines in "Lancer" was not in the screenplay but rather an idea DiCaprio had on set while filming. Afterwards Tarantino came up with the idea for Dalton's "freakout" scene in his trailer, taking inspiration from Robert De Niro's performance in Martin Scorsese's "Taxi Driver". Tarantino stated, "It's got to be like Travis Bickle when he's in his apartment by himself." DiCaprio improvised the entire scene.
Music.
Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the soundtrack from the film. It is a compilation album of classic rock, which includes multiple tracks from Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders, as well as 1960s radio ads and DJ patter. The film also contains numerous songs and scores not included on the soundtrack, including from artists The Mamas &amp; the Papas and Elmer Bernstein.

Both the DVD and Blu-ray contain a deleted scene, in which Charles Manson confronts Paul Barabuta, portrayed by Danny Strong, the homeowner and caretaker of the Tate-Polanski residence. Barabuta is based on the home's owner, Rudolph Altobelli, and its caretaker, William Garretson.
Reception.
Box office.
"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" grossed $142.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $232.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $374.6 million. By some estimates, the film needed to gross around $250 million worldwide in order to break-even, with others estimating it would need to make $400 million in order to turn a profit.

The film made $16.9 million on its first day, including $5.8 million from Thursday night previews (the highest total of Tarantino's career). It went on to debut to $41.1 million, finishing second behind holdover "The Lion King" and marking Tarantino's largest opening. Comscore reported that 47% of audience members went to see the film because of who the director was (compared to the typical 7%) and 37% went because of the cast (compared to normally 18%). The film grossed $20 million in its second weekend, representing a "nice" drop of just 51% and finishing third, and then made $11.6 million and $7.6 million the subsequent weekends. In its fifth weekend the film made $5 million, bringing its running domestic total to $123.1 million, becoming the second-highest of Tarantino's career behind "Django Unchained".

Critical response.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 85% based on 569 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Thrillingly unrestrained yet solidly crafted, "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" tempers Tarantino's provocative impulses with the clarity of a mature filmmaker's vision." Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 83 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating "universal acclaim." Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave it an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an average of 4 out of 5 stars and a 58% "definite recommend."
"The Hollywood Reporter" said critics had "an overall positive view," with some calling it "Tarantino's love letter to '60s L.A.," praising its cast and setting, while others were "divided on its ending." ReelViews' James Berardinelli awarded the film 3.5 stars out of 4, saying it was "made by a movie-lover for movie-lovers. And even those who don't qualify may still enjoy the hell out of it." RogerEbert.com's Brian Tallerico gave it four out of four stars, calling it "layered and ambitious, the product of a confident filmmaker working with collaborators completely in tune with his vision". The "Chicago Sun-Times", Richard Roeper described it as "a brilliant and sometimes outrageously fantastic mash-up of real-life events and characters with pure fiction," giving it full marks.
Peter Bradshaw of "The Guardian" gave it five out of five stars, praising Pitt and DiCaprio's performances and calling it "Tarantino's dazzling LA redemption song." Steve Pond of "TheWrap" said: "Big, brash, ridiculous, too long, and in the end invigorating, the film is a grand playground for its director to fetishize old pop culture and bring his gleeful perversity to the craft of moviemaking." Peter Travers of "Rolling Stone" awarded the film 4.5 out of 5 stars, remarking that "All the actors, in roles large and small, bring their A games to the film. Two hours and 40 minutes can feel long for some. I wouldn't change a frame." Katie Rife of "The A.V. Club" gave it a B+, noting "The relationship between Rick and Cliff is at the emotional heart of "Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood"" and calling it Tarantino's "wistful midlife crisis movie."
In "Little White Lies", Christopher Hooton described it as "occasionally tedious" but "constantly awe-inspiring," noting it did not seem to be a "love letter to Hollywood" but an "obituary for a moment in culture that looks unlikely to ever be resurrected."
Writing for "Variety", Owen Gleiberman called it a "heady engrossing collage of a film—but not, in the end, a masterpiece."
Richard Brody of "The New Yorker" called it an "obscenely regressive vision of the sixties" that "celebrates white-male stardom (and behind-the-scenes command) at the expense of everyone else." Caspar Salmon of "The Guardian" took issue with the violence in the film, writing, "Tarantino's filmography reveals a director in search of increasingly gruesome settings to validate his revenge fantasies and...blood-thirst."
Analysis and interpretation.
Dan Schindel of "Hyperallergic" wrote of the symbolism in the film's nostalgia. He wrote the detail is almost "microscopic," in its use of "hundreds of period ephemera" across various mediums, most of which is unrecognizable to most viewers. Schindel writes that these forgotten memories surround the character of Rick Dalton because he too is a piece of forgotten nostalgia. Schindel also writes about the dynamics between the characters. Dalton and Booth represent the duality of attitudes towards "their seeming impending obsolesce." Booth being relaxed and accepting it and Dalton being fragile and insecure about it. As Dalton's whole life is about how he is perceived, he is obsessed with how he wishes to be perceived. Sharon Tate, also an actor is filled with joy when she is able to see herself entertain a theater audience. But, Schindel says, that scene also humanizes her, making her a person, rather than the "victim" she has become. He also expresses that Dalton and Booth represent Old Hollywood, while Tate represents New Hollywood and the future. Schindel states that Tarantino uses darkness, both for Booth and his questionable past as well as in the Manson Family. While Booth's possible crimes shade the nostalgia, the Manson clan shades the future. In the end, however, not only are Booth and Dalton able to save the future, but Dalton becomes the hero he always wanted to be.
Travis Woods also wrote of what the three characters represent and how it is demonstrated in the film. He states that the three leads represent the past, present, and future. Dalton is the past, stuck in a fading world and afraid to let go. Booth is the present, always living in the moment, and Tate the promise of a future on the rise. They also represent three class levels of Hollywood with Booth literally living in the shadows of the movie industry. His home is a trailer in the shadows of the Van Nuys Drive-In Theater. Woods also construes how Booth being the stunt double of Dalton is illustrated throughout. Dalton struggles with an emotional arc and change, while Booth clashes with danger and physical obstacles. Woods points out the actors job is to provide the audience with the emotional arc, while the stuntman's job is to step in for the physicality and danger, as told to us in the first scene. This is shown when Dalton faces his existential fears on the set of "Lancer" by taking on a new acting challenge on a Western set and overcoming his fears and inner struggles. Meanwhile, Booth comes in to handle the dangerous stuff on another Western set where he also triumphs. While they both have their victories, Tate has hers as well by not only simply living her life but also by watching herself in a movie with an audience. Woods writes the finale ties it all together: And so, Dalton fearlessly confronts the would-be killers outside of his home. After a cut, "Booth enters the scene... cheats death," and handles the physical danger. At the end, Dalton re-enters and gets the glory. A feat that could not have been achieved by either the actor or stuntman alone, but only together. Woods concludes, this also represents the past and present "uniting to allow for a better future." "The past leads to the present, and the present leads to the future, and all three are required for the narrative to continue."
David G. Hughes wrote of the symbolized fantasy. While noting that Tate is a "symbol of effervescent life, unadulterated joy, and graceful innocence," he was much more interested in what Booth represents. He wrote how Dalton's stress and psychological issues prevent him from being a symbol of fantasy for the audience. Booth is the film's hero and simultaneously works loyally for Dalton from a place of low social standing. Hughes states this could be "a Marxist point about invisible labor and the Substructure." However, Hughes feels this does not work to engage the audience. He draws on Sigmund Freud and his "Psychopathic Characters on the Stage". He says what makes Booth interesting and particularly Brad Pitt's portrayal of him is sex appeal. Being handsome, strong, loyal, and courageous makes him desirable. Hughes states that Booth is Laura Mulvey's "...perfect, ...complete, more powerful ideal ego." Tarantino has Booth fight Bruce Lee to create the myth of Booth. Hughes also writes that Booth embodies the Buddha's teachings on Zen, but also that he is capable of "barbaric violence." These qualities make him the "fantasy of righteous male power." Hughes compares Booth to Charles Manson, saying both are violent outcasts who sit between the worlds of Western Renaissance and Eastern philosophy. However, he says they are the antithesis of each other. While Booth has a code, Manson only serves himself. Manson "is Hollywood's monster from the id [and Booth] is its ego ideal and savior."
Steven Hyden of Uproxx interpreted the ending of the film as a vision of Cliff Booth brought on through his consumption of LSD. Hyden proposes that when Booth smokes the acid-cigarette and says, "And away we go," it marks the beginning of his vision. He then leaves to take his dog Brandy for a walk, walking by the car of killers down the street who Hyden believes Booth sees in the car and recognizes from Spahn Ranch. This allows Booth's imagination to run wild thanks to the acid. He imagines the killers in the car talking about his and Dalton's show, "Bounty Law". He then imagines a scenario that lets him play out his violent fantasies and allows Dalton to be a hero, using a flamethrower from a film he would never actually still own but which occupies a place in Booth's memory. Hyden writes that the ending is Booth's hallucinatory fantasy that allows him to stay employed by Dalton, while also allowing Dalton to be accepted by the New Hollywood elite, Sharon Tate. Also that in this fantasy Tate and members of the Manson Family are fans of Dalton, just as Booth is.
Steven Boone of "The Hollywood Reporter" also commented on the ending feeling like Booth's fantasy. About the ending, he wrote "It's as if stuntman Cliff, a serene Hollywood foot soldier...was the editor here." He also referred to Dalton going to Tate's house as "entering the gates of Cielo Drive's Hollywood heaven." Something his colleague Simon Abrams also alluded to when he commented, "Jay Sebring invites [Dalton] in for a drink like a hipper St. Peter." Dan Schindel also saw Dalton's walk up Tate's driveway as "an ascent to heaven," based on the "rising camera movement."
A Los Angeles Catholic bishop, Robert Barron, praised the character of Cliff Booth as embodying the four cardinal virtues, while theologian David Bentley Hart wrote that it "exhibit[s] a genuine ethical pathos" for its portrayal of "cosmic justice." He praised the revisionism when "Tarantino's version of the story unexpectedly veered away into some other, dreamlike, better world, where the monsters inadvertently passed through the wrong door and met the end they deserved."
Writing in the academic journal "Animation", Jason Barker draws from Aristotle's "Poetics" to analyze in detail the film's use of "cartoon violence", speculating that such violence "is more or less inversely related to the film’s dramatic content". Barker concludes that: "Through self-indulgent, inane, insane and tyrannical cartoonism, "Once Upon a Time. . . in Hollywood" presents not so much a measure of contemporary violence, as a measure of indifference to violence: dramatic indifference and, perhaps, social indifference to a cartoon violence that is real in more ways than one."
On Medium Av Sinensky wrote about the ending of the film when Susan Atkins concludes the Manson Family members should kill Dalton because he played a character who killed people on TV, he "taught them to kill." Sinensky notes that Tarantino is putting "the words of his critics into the mouth of a Manson murderer," regarding his use of fictional gratuitous violence. While David G. Hughes opined that Tarantino is using the scene to say that those who crusade against fictional violence are hypocrites and complicit in real violence. Hughes wrote that by switching the real-life violence by Manson Family members with movie violence instead directed at them, "Tarantino is making a firm distinction between cruel real-world violence and ethical, cathartic fantasy violence."

Cultural references.
The title is a reference to director Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West" and "Once Upon a Time in America". On the poster of Dalton's film "Red Blood Red Skin", inspired by "Land Raiders", he appears with Telly Savalas. The posters for the two films are the same, except with Dalton replacing George Maharis. The movie Voytek Frykowski is watching is "Teenage Monster", presented by horror host Seymour.
Archive footage from many films is included in "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood", including "C.C. and Company", "Lady in Cement", "Three in the Attic", and "The Wrecking Crew", in which Sharon Tate appears as Freya Carlson. Three scenes were digitally altered, replacing the original actors with Rick Dalton. One from an episode of "The F.B.I.", entitled "All the Streets Are Silent," in which Dalton appears as the character portrayed by Burt Reynolds in the actual episode. Another from "Death on the Run", with Dalton's face imposed over Ty Hardin's. The third is from "The Great Escape", with Dalton appearing as Virgil Hilts, the role made famous by Steve McQueen. For "The 14 Fists of McCluskey", a WWII film within the film starring Dalton, footage and music from "Hell River" is used.

Cliff Booth is a reference to Brad Pitt's character in Tarantino's "Inglourious Basterds", Lt. Aldo Raine, a special forces WWII veteran who takes the cover of a stuntman. One of Rick Dalton's Italian films in the movie is directed by real-life director Antonio Margheriti. Antonio Margheriti is also used as an alias for Sgt. Donny Donowitz (Eli Roth) in "Inglourious Basterds". The scene involving Dalton playing a character who burns Nazis with a flamethrower is similar to the ending of "Inglourious Basterds", which ends with Nazi leadership being burned to death. 
The final scene features Dalton in a commercial for fictional Red Apple cigarettes, which appear in many Tarantino films. When Dalton and Booth get back from Italy they walk by the blue mosaic wall in LAX, the same wall that the title character in Tarantino's "Jackie Brown" (Pam Grier) moves past in the opening credits of that film. The characters of stunt coordinator husband and wife, Randy (Kurt Russell) and Janet Lloyd (Zoë Bell) are an homage to characters in Tarantino's "Death Proof"; Stuntman Mike McKay (Russell) and Zoë Bell who plays herself, a stunt woman.
In the film, Bruce Lee engages in a fight with Cliff Booth on the set of "The Green Hornet". The "Green Hornet" theme song is featured in Tarantino's '. The masks worn by the Crazy 88 gang in that film are the same as Lee's mask as Kato in "The Green Hornet". The car Booth drives is a 1964 blue Volkswagen Karmann Ghia convertible. It is the same year, color, make and model of the car that Beatrix "the Bride" Kiddo (Uma Thurman) drives in '. Similarly, Rick Dalton's 1966 Cadillac de Ville is the same exact car driven by Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) in "Reservoir Dogs". It was owned by Madsen.
Historical accuracy.
In a scene, Sharon Tate goes into Larry Edmunds Bookshop and purchases a copy of "Tess of the d'Urbervilles". In real life, Tate gave a copy to Roman Polanski shortly before her death. Years later, Polanski directed the film adaptation, "Tess", dedicating it to Tate. Tate and Polanski's Yorkie Terrier in the film is named "Dr. Sapirstein," as was Tate's Yorkie in real life, named after the doctor portrayed by Ralph Bellamy in "Rosemary's Baby". The carrier she puts the dog in is the one that Tate actually owned. The outfit Margot Robbie wears in the Bruin Theater scene is based on the one Tate wore in "Eye of the Devil".
In the film, Tate goes to see "The Wrecking Crew" at the Bruin Theater. She convinces the theater's employees that she stars in the movie after they fail to recognize her. Tarantino stated the scene came from a personal experience. When "True Romance" was released, he saw it at the same theater, where he eventually convinced its employees that he wrote the script.
On the set of "Batman", for a crossover episode with "The Green Hornet", a fight was scripted with Kato (Bruce Lee) losing to Robin (Burt Ward). When Lee received the script, he refused to do it, so it was changed to a draw. When the cameras rolled, Lee stalked Ward until Ward backed away. Lee laughed and told him he was "lucky it is a TV show." Stuntman Gene LeBell put Lee in a Judo hold on "The Green Hornet Set" in response to Lee hurting stuntmen. In the film, Stuntman Cliff Booth fights Lee on the set of "The Green Hornet"; the fight ends in a draw. Booth refers to Lee as "Kato."
According to Rudolph Altobelli, who rented the house to Polanski and Tate, in March 1969, Charles Manson showed up. Polanski's friend Shahrokh Hatami also said he saw Manson enter the grounds. Hatami approached Manson, asking him what he wanted. He told Hatami he was looking for Terry Melcher. Hatami responded the house was the Polanski residence and perhaps Melcher lived in the guest house. Altobelli told Manson that Melcher no longer lived there. This happens in the film, with Jay Sebring in place of Altobelli and Hatami.
On the night of August 8, 1969, Patricia Krenwinkel, Tex Watson, and Susan Atkins broke into Tate's house, murdering her and four others. In the film, they go to Tate's house to commit the murders but instead end up breaking into Dalton's house after he interrupts them. Linda Kasabian went along that night, though she did not murder anyone and stayed outside the whole time as a lookout. In the film, she goes along and does not murder anyone but takes off and does not stay. Watson told his victims, "I'm the Devil, and I came to do the Devil's business." In the film, he says it to Cliff Booth.
In the film, Atkins convinces the others to seek revenge by killing Rick Dalton, star of a TV western. Since TV taught them to kill, it is fitting they kill the guy from TV, and "My idea is to kill the people who taught us to kill!" In real life, Manson Family member Nancy Pitman said: "We are what you have made us. We were brought up on your TV. We were brought up watching "Gunsmoke" and "Have Gun – Will Travel"." Sandra Good said: "You want to talk about devils and demonic and immorals and evil, go to Hollywood. We don't touch the evil of that world. We don't even skim it." In the film when the four Manson Family members who drive to Tate's house are sitting outside in their car, Rick Dalton comes out of his house and yells at them to leave. In real-life the four members stopped at the house of Rudolf Weber, down the street from Tate's house. Weber came out and yelled at them to leave. Weber told the police he was tired of hippies on his street.
Clem Grogan was convicted of the murder of stuntman Donald Shea on Spahn Ranch, whom he repeatedly beat with a lead pipe. In the film, Grogan is instead beaten by stuntman Cliff Booth. The 1959 Ford Galaxie driven by the Manson Family is a detailed replica of the car used in the Tate–LaBianca murders. Car coordinator Steven Butcher found the actual car, but after a meeting with Tarantino, they decided using it would be "too creepy." Boeing 747s are used in several airliner scenes, but were not in commercial use until 1970. The film is set in 1969.
Character controversies.
Bruce Lee.
The film's depiction of Bruce Lee drew criticism. Fans and contemporaries of Lee, including his protégé Dan Inosanto, criticized the portrayal. Lee's daughter Shannon described the depiction as "an arrogant asshole who was full of hot air" and "They didn't need to treat him in the way White Hollywood did when he was alive." Lee's student and friend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who starred with Lee in "Game of Death", stated that Tarantino's portrayal of Lee was "sloppy and somewhat racist".
Mike Moh, who played Lee, said he was conflicted at first: "Bruce in my mind was literally a god. ... Bruce didn't always have the most affection for stuntmen; he didn't respect all of them." He stated, "Tarantino loves Bruce Lee; he reveres him." Brad Pitt and stunt coordinator Robert Alonzo objected to an extended version of the fight in which Lee loses. According to Lee's friend and "The Green Hornet" stuntman Gene LeBell, Lee had a reputation for "kicking the shit out of the stuntmen. They couldn't convince him that he could go easy and it would still look great on film." In "Bruce Lee: A Life", Lee's biographer Matthew Polly wrote, Lee would jump-kick people on the set. According to Lee's co-star Van Williams, it stopped when "He dislocated [a set designer's] jaw." Polly continued, "Bruce insisted on close quarters combat. The stuntmen hated it." Williams said, "[The stuntmen]...didn't want to work on the show. They were tired of getting hurt." LeBell was tasked with "calming Bruce down." According to Williams, Lee's treatment of stuntmen drove the show's stunt coordinator Bennie E. Dobbins to want to fight Lee.
Tarantino responded, saying Lee was "kind of an arrogant guy," and that Lee's widow Linda wrote in "" that he could beat Muhammad Ali. She wrote, "Even the most scathing critics admitted that Bruce's Gungfu was sensational. One critic wrote, 'Those who watched him would bet on Lee to render Cassius Clay (Ali) senseless if they were put in a room and told anything goes.'" In 1972, Lee himself stated: "Everybody says I must fight Ali some day. ... Look at my hand. That's a little Chinese hand. He'd kill me."
Shannon filed a complaint with the China Film Administration affecting the film's release in China unless alterations were made. After Tarantino refused to remove the scene, China cancelled the release of the film on October 18, 2019, one week before its release date.
Sharon Tate.
After being contacted over concerns, Tarantino invited a representative of Roman Polanski, Sharon Tate's widower, over to his house to read the script and report back to Polanski, to assure him "he didn't have anything to worry about". Tarantino stated: "When it comes to Polanski, we're talking about a tragedy that would be unfathomable for most human beings," and that he did not contact him while writing it, as he did not want to cause him anxiety. Despite this, Polanski's wife Emmanuelle Seigner criticized Tarantino for using Polanski's likeness after the film's premiere.
Debra Tate, Sharon's sister, initially opposed the film, saying it was exploitative and perpetuated mistruths: "To celebrate the killers and the darkest portion of society as being sexy or acceptable in any way, shape or form is just perpetuating the worst of our society." After Tarantino contacted her and showed her the script, she withdrew her opposition, saying: "This movie is not what people would expect it to be when you combine the Tarantino and Manson names." She felt that Tarantino was a "very stand-up guy"; after visiting the set, she was impressed by Robbie and lent her some of Sharon's jewelry and perfume to wear in the film.
After the premiere, journalist Farah Nayeri asked Tarantino why Robbie had so few lines. Tarantino responded, "I reject your hypothesis." Robbie elaborated, "I think the moments on screen show those wonderful sides of [Tate] could be adequately done without speaking." Tarantino said, "I thought it would both be touching and pleasurable and also sad and melancholy to just spend a little time with [Tate], just existing... I wanted you to see Sharon a lot."
Manson Family.
Charles Manson was convicted of the murders of Tate and four others, despite not being present, due mostly to a theory presented by prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi that Manson was trying to instigate an apocalyptic race war, leaving only Black Muslims and the Family. According to the theory, the Black Muslims would eventually look to Manson to lead them. According to members of the Family; Paul Watkins, Juan Flynn and Barbara Hoyt, Manson referred to the race war as Helter Skelter, getting the name from the song of the same name.
Musician and filmmaker Boots Riley criticized Tarantino's film for not portraying Bugliosi's Helter Skelter narrative, or depicting the Family as white supremacists. As did Lorraine Ali of the "Los Angeles Times". Saying that portraying The Manson Family as hippies is "a more bankable image than Manson the ignorant white supremacist."
However, according to members of The Family; Susan Atkins, Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel, Catherine Share, and Ruth Ann Moorehouse, the Tate murders were not perpetrated to start Helter Skelter, but as copycat murders mirroring that of Gary Hinman, in an attempt to convince police the killer was still at large, and get Bobby Beausoleil released from jail, as he was charged with Hinman's murder. He stated the murders had nothing to do with race.
According to Jay Sebring's protégé and business partner Jim Markham, who provided original Sebring hair products for "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood", the murders were instigated by a drug deal gone bad, not a race war. He believes Manson was at Tate's house the day before the murders to sell drugs to Sebring and Voytek Frykowski, which resulted in the two beating Manson up. In his interview with Truman Capote, Beausoleil said, "They burned people on dope deals. Sharon Tate and that gang."
On "The Joe Rogan Experience", Tarantino said he thought Bugliosi's theory was "bullshit." He believes Manson never sent anyone over to Tate's house to murder anyone, and that the murders happened spontaneously.

"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood".
In November 2020, Tarantino signed a two-book deal with HarperCollins. On June 29, 2021, he published his first novel, an adaptation of "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood". The audiobook is narrated by Jennifer Jason Leigh who previously starred in Tarantino's "The Hateful Eight". According to Tarantino, her "Hateful Eight" character Daisy Domergue was "A Manson girl out west, like Susan Atkins or something."
According to Tarantino, the novel is "a complete rethinking of the entire story", and adds details to various sequences and characters, including multiple chapters dedicated to the backstory of Cliff Booth. The novel also departs from the film; the film's finale occurs towards the beginning of the novel, and its aftermath includes Rick Dalton earning newfound fame as a regular on "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson". It also focuses on Charles Manson's pursuit of a music career, the "inner worlds" of Sharon Tate and Trudi Frazer, and has a whole chapter focused on actor Aldo Ray.
"The Films of Rick Dalton".
In June 2021, Tarantino revealed he wrote and plans to publish a second novel connected to "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" about the films of Rick Dalton. The book details every film and TV series of Dalton's entire career, some of which are completely fictional but the majority of Dalton's work are real, with Dalton replacing the actors who actually starred in the films. In it, Cliff Booth writes a film for Dalton featuring a flamethrower, which they produce and Dalton directs.

On the other side, KT, who appears happy, hides a deep wound within. When Chanda Rathore, a prospective bride for KT, insults him because he rejected her, KT's uncle Sushant motivates him to work again.
KT offers a business partnership to Preeti, which she initially denies but agrees when KT stands for her before a wretched client. They face many issues in their initial days of business, but this leads them to develop a bond of friendship, trust, and respect.
Tarun puts forth a challenge before Preeti where, in 25 days, she will have to prove herself capable of becoming a businesswoman. With KT's help, she wins.
While organizing Bua Sa and Fufa Sa's 50th wedding anniversary, misunderstandings occur, leading Preeti to break her partnership with KT after finishing an event with a mysterious client.
On the day of the wedding event, the mysterious client turns out to be KT's ex-wife, Nandini. To get his revenge, KT marries Preeti. However, Preeti knows that their relationship is respect for each other.
After their marriage, Preeti falls in love with KT, and they collaborate to discover Nandini's motive.
On the day of Makar Sankranti, Nandini discloses Arjun is an orphan. KT is caught in a fire but is saved by Preeti. Nandini is arrested but vows to return. Later, Tarun and Arjun apologize to Preeti for mistreating her.
Kusum breaks ties with Preeti when Neel denies having any feelings for Priyanka and becomes engaged to Shika. Neel tells KT and Preeti that Kushaala pressured him to marry as they went through a business crisis. Preeti and KT arrange the money through Shaadi Mubarak. Kusum apologizes to Preeti and gives her blessings to Priyanka and Neel. Preeti and KT both agree to divorce, as KT doesn't love Preeti.
While Preeti leaves for Mumbai, KT realizes he is in love with her. Desperate to win her back, KT rushes to Preeti and declares his love for her publicly, and they reconcile.
Kusum goes abroad with Aastha for her studies. Preeti is heartbroken after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer. KT and Peeeti long for a child so they chose Phurti, a carefree bubbly girl who dreams of settling in London, as a surrogate in return for sending her to London. Phurti becomes pregnant with KT and Preeti's child through IVF. Preeti introduces Phurti as her sister to the family as she begins to live in the Tibrewal Mansion.
The Tibrewals are in turmoil following the revelations regarding Phurti's pregnancy as KT accepts the baby as his and Preeti's. Kushaala criticizes Preeti for taking her son away from her after KT takes a stand on his and Preeti's decision to choose surrogacy to get KT and the family a child. After some tension, the family eventually accepts the surrogacy situation.
Eight months later.
Juhi finds a doctor that can cure Preeti. While KT and Preeti’s baby shower occurs, Kushaala finds Preeti in pain after slipping in the bathroom and admits her to the hospital. After seeing Preeti at the cancer hospital in Delhi on the news, KT confronts Juhi, revealing about Preeti’s illness. Phurti goes into premature labor and delivers a girl. Preeti’s surgery is successful, but she is suffering from amnesia. While the hospital catches on fire, Preeti helps a pregnant Shikha and is taken in by her and her husband, Vishal.
KT has an emotional outburst when he doesn’t find Preeti and blames Kushaala for not caring for her. Vishal and Shikha go to the hospital to find out about Preeti’s family, but some confusion leads them to think that Preeti is a different patient, Mohi Bansal. Shikha delivers a baby girl but asks Mohi to take care of her after an accident. Vishal hates Mohi, thinking she is the reason for Shikha’s death. KT stops his family from performing Preeti’s last rituals and states that she will return.
Five years later.
KT is an RJ and a doting father of his and Preeti’s daughter, Kirti. Preeti, who still thinks she is ‘Mohi,’ moves to Udaipur. Shikha and Vishal’s daughter, also named Preeti, and Kirti is admitted to the same school. Kirti, not knowing Mohi is her mother, dislikes her when she makes her clean the school floor. Mohi hates KT when he rusticates her after Kirti complains to him about her.
Mohi calls KT to confront him about his decision, but he doesn’t answer, so she goes to the Tibrewal mansion. The Tibrewals are happily celebrating Holi while KT feels Mohi’s presence and searches for her. KT encounters Mohi, and she warns him to retract his complaint. Everyone becomes emotional seeing her while she furiously goes from there. 
KT learns about Mohi’s past and befriends her, but he hides his identity and goes by the name ‘Keertan.’ Mohi accepts Keertan’s request to join Shaadi Mubarak, but after learning that the owner is none other than KT she immediately declines the job offer. Keertan makes Mohi realize that KT is not a bad person and she rejoins the office.
KT is frozen to his place after Kirti gets stuck in a fire and remembers the hospital incident. Mohi rescues her while KT scolds Kirti for not respecting Mohi. Vishal plans vengeance on Mohi for separating his daughter from him. Mohi suspects Keertan’s intentions after he takes KT’s side whenever he lands into trouble. Kushaala confronts Priyanka and Neel after overhearing their conversation to separate Mohi and little Preeti. Priyanka stands her ground by stating that she feels Mohi isn’t getting what she deserves and reveals that she has suffered from two miscarriages and is only doing what’s best for the family. Mohi witnesses Kirti and little Preeti being kidnapped and rescues them.

Time-resolved RNA sequencing

Time-resolved RNA sequencing methods are applications of RNA-seq that allow for observations of RNA abundances over time in a biological sample or samples. Second-Generation DNA sequencing has enabled cost effective, high throughput and unbiased analysis of the transcriptome. Normally, RNA-seq is only capable of capturing a snapshot of the transcriptome at the time of sample collection. This necessitates multiple samplings at multiple time points, which increases both monetary and time costs for experiments. Methodological and technological innovations have allowed for the analysis of the RNA transcriptome over time without requiring multiple samplings at various time points.
Background.
While DNA encodes all of the functional elements of life, the information encoded must be converted into functional form. Following the central dogma of molecular biology, messenger RNA encodes genetic information for producing proteins, which, alongside functional RNA carry out the majority of cellular processes required for life. Changes in RNA abundance may be used as a measurement of changes in cellular behavior, such as heat stress, infection by virus, or oncogenesis. Knowledge of how the transcriptome changes during cellular processes allows for greater understanding of the exact mechanisms underlying these processes.
Originally, transcriptome-wide RNA abundance could only be assessed using methods such as DNA microarrays or serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). These methods are prohibitive in differing regards; microarrays, while cheap, provide inconsistent results and SAGE is based on sanger sequencing, which provides limited throughput. Using second generation sequencing, instead of measuring relative hybridization of sequences to probes in the case of microarrays or sequencing short segments in the case of SAGE, a researcher can simply sequence the bulk RNA within a sample and measure relative abundances of specific types of RNA by comparing the number of times each RNA molecule was sequenced in a given sample.
Normally, in a traditional RNA-seq, microarray, or SAGE experiment RNA is extracted from a biological sample such as cultured cells, and the RNA is analyzed using the chosen method. The data obtained from such an experiment corresponds to abundance of RNA under the given experimental conditions at the time of harvest. For many applications, such as comparing the abundance of mRNA molecules between cells exposed to a drug and those not exposed to the drug, this type of experimental approach is sufficient. However, many cellular processes of scientific and medical interest are processes which occur over time, such as cellular differentiation or phagocytosis. Studying such processes requires analysis of RNA abundance across a series of time points.
Methods.
Time series samples.
Sample preparation and data processing.
The simplest approach towards assessing RNA abundance over time is to simply use multiple samples which are treated in exactly the same way, except for the duration of treatment. For example, to investigate a biological process which is estimated to occur for an hour, a researcher might design an experiment where the process is triggered for five minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, one hour, and two hours in separate cell culture samples before harvesting the cells for RNA-seq analysis. The researcher would then have measurements of the transcriptome at each of these time points, and comparing between these samples would indicate which cellular processes are activated and deactivated over time.
Strengths.
This method is the most common for measurement of RNA over time in cell culture models, mainly due to its simplicity. Each biological sample need only be processed in exactly the same way, and the factor of time is easily adjusted in most experimental protocols. Furthermore, since each time point is its own sample, more RNA can be harvested and sequenced for a study.
Weaknesses.
The requirement of multiple samples for time-resolved data collection increases the cost of the experiment as well as introducing a greater potential for technical errors. While the price of massively parallel sequencing has decreased greatly since its introduction, it is still prohibitively expensive for many laboratories to conduct large scale RNA-seq studies. This issue is compounded by additional time points increasing the number of samples by a multiple of the number of time points; using two time points rather than one doubles the number of samples required in an experiment. Consequently, many studies which use time series RNA-seq become limited in either their sample size, which reduces statistical power, or the number of time points, which reduces their time resolution, or both. Finally, by requiring a greater number of biological samples, there is greater risk for human error to affect the results, which may lead to spurious conclusions
Affinity Purification.
Sample preparation and data processing.
In this approach, cell culture samples are cultured with tagged nucleotides which allow for selective purification of newly synthesized RNA molecules. One popular approach is pulse labeling with 4-thiouridine (4-sU), a uracil analogue that is incorporated in newly synthesized RNA molecules. In this type of experiment, a researcher would supplement cells with 4-sU at the time of the experiment or shortly beforehand. When the experimental treatment presumably affects RNA expression, newly synthesized RNA would be labeled with 4-sU. Newly synthesized RNA is labeled with a reactive thiol group, making it possible to link useful molecules to the RNA. Biotin is a popular molecule for use in this type of assay, as it is inexpensive and binds incredibly strongly and selectively to streptavidin. Incubation of biotinylated RNA with beads containing streptavidin allows for the selective purification of newly synthesized RNA. From here, newly synthesized and total RNA are sequenced separately and compared for differences.
Strengths.
Affinity purification makes use of the incredibly popular biotin-streptavidin system for fractionation of biological materials. Binding of biotin to streptavidin is incredibly strong (Kd &lt; 10−14 mol/L). It is also highly specific, which results in minimal background signal from non-specific binding events. Furthermore, time resolution is obtained in a single biological sample, resulting in reduced biological variability compared to using separate samples for each time point.
Weaknesses.
The weaknesses of this method are mainly centered around efficiency. One major difficulty is uptake of 4-sU into cultured cells. If 4-sU is given too early, then it will be incorporated into RNA that was not synthesized before the cell began responding to the experimental conditions. If it is given too late, then early stages of the cellular response are not captured by the experiment. The rate of uptake of 4-sU can be measured, but this requires additional experiments to determine optimal dosage and time. Furthermore, these parameters need to be measured in the specific cell lines of interest, as different cell lines may take up 4-sU more slowly than others.
RNA is known to be prone to degradation "in vitro". It is common for experimental protocols involving RNA to include a number of steps to reduce chances of Ribonuclease contamination or spontaneous degradation of samples, as RNA quality affects RNA-seq results. Metabolic labeling involves a number of additional steps that must be performed in the laboratory on RNA that is in solution. Since metabolic labeling requires that the RNA be kept unfrozen in liquid solution, some level of spontaneous degradation is unavoidable, although it is usually not to such an extent that results are affected. Of greater risk is the chances of ribonuclease contamination, which would render a sample useless, wasting time and resources. It is important for researchers working with RNA in any capacity to minimize unnecessary handling of RNA due to these risks. One additional drawback of using this method is, given equivalent sample size, more sequencing runs are required compared to a time-series experiment. This is because multiple RNA samples corresponding to the initial time point must be sequenced.
Research suggests that 4-sU labeling may result in transcriptional changes on its own, which would affect any results obtained using this method.
Nucleotide Conversion.
Sample preparation and data processing.
Nucleotide conversion works by converting some nucleotides in newly synthesized RNA into others, which can be detected through sequencing. Timelapse-seq is an example of such an approach. As in affinity purification, cells are incubated with 4-sU. After extraction of RNA from samples, they are treated with 2,2,2-trifluoroethylamine and sodium periodate, which converts 4-sU into trifluoroethyl cytosine, a cytosine analogue that is sequenced as a cytosine nucleotide instead of uracil. During sequence alignment and data processing, the U-to-C conversions are used to quantify the number of transcripts that are newly synthesized compared to bulk RNA.
Strengths.
This method shares many strengths with affinity purification; notably the fact that multiple samples are not required for a time-series. This method eliminates the need for multiple sequencing runs for multiple time points, as all RNA is run together on the sequencing instrument and labeled RNA is separated from nonlabeled "in silico". This reduces sequencing costs significantly, as now time resolution may be obtained without the need for additional samples or additional sequencing runs. Furthermore, by sequencing multiple time points together, technical variability introduced by sample processing is further reduced in addition to the reduced biological variability provided through the 4-sU experimental strategy.
Weaknesses.
As with strengths, this method shares many weaknesses with affinity purification methods. Notably, 4-sU uptake and increased sample handling. Since Timelapse-seq relies upon synthetic chemistry methods to convert nucleotides, incomplete reactions result in an underestimation of the abundance of newly synthesized RNA and may result in variability between samples.
Nascent Transcript Sequencing.
Sample preparation and data processing.
Unlike metabolic labeling, nascent transcript sequencing (NET-seq) directly sequences transcripts that are still undergoing transcription by RNA polymerase II. This method allows for the study of the dynamics of transcription elongation, which is not possible with metabolic labeling techniques. For a NET-seq experiment, cells are treated as with a standard RNA-seq experiment until they are lysed. Lysis is performed such that RNA-protein complexes remain intact, and RNA polymerase II is immunoprecipitated from the lysate. RNA that was undergoing transcription from DNA is still attached to RNA polymerase and is subsequently eluted from the polymerase and sequenced.
Strengths.
Since NET-seq extracts transcripts that have not completed transcription, it is possible to obtain single-nucleotide resolution on the most recently synthesized nucleotide of transcripts. This is valuable in the study of phenomena such as transcriptional kinetics. Furthermore, it allows for the study of unstable transcripts which are degraded shortly after transcription. The general approach of immunoprecipitating RNA-binding proteins has great utility in understanding other areas of RNA biology, such as splicing.
Weaknesses.
This method relies upon immunoprecipitation of RNA polymerase II. There are a number of issues with immunoprecipitation, including non-specific binding interactions which may result in the immunoprecipitation of off-target RNA molecules.
The temporal resolution of NET-seq is limited to transcription elongation. While comparing relative abundances between transcripts using NET-seq is possible, it is not the intention of the method.
Future Directions.
Aside from time-series sampling, there are currently no methods for comparing more than two time points. Metabolic labeling experiments are only capable of comparing RNA abundances before and after pulse-labeling. It is of interest to be able to observe modifications to the transcriptome over a series of time points in a single sample, as this would provide increased time resolution in studies. Existing methods of metabolic labeling are of interest for this; if multiple different metabolic labels were used at differing time points this may allow for intermediate time points to be investigated. However, such approaches must be developed with care, as biases in labeling methods and sample processing steps could contribute to misleading results if data from different methods are compared to one another.
Metabolic labeling with 4-sU has been reported to affect cellular phenotype. In current practice, this is unavoidable and is tolerated as the obtained data still fit current biological models, as well as the fact that 4-sU samples are compared with 4-sU samples in most cases. However, this has the potential to result in spurious conclusions, especially if there is any interaction between the effect of 4-sU and the chosen experimental condition. It is not possible to distinguish differences in RNA levels as being due to the experimental conditions being studied or being the result of 4-sU treatment. Identification of labeling chemicals that do not affect cellular phenotype would eliminate these issues altogether.

Take No Prisoners (Peabo Bryson album)

Take No Prisoners is the eleventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Peabo Bryson It was released by Elektra Records in June 1985 in the United States. Produced by Arif Mardin and Tommy LiPuma, the album peaked at number 102 on the US "Billboard" 200 and number 40 on the US R&amp;B albums chart.
Three singles were released, including the title track and the pop crossover ballad "Love Always Finds a Way", the latter of which peaked at number 26 on the US Adult Contemporary chart in early 1986. The album's title track became a minor hit on both the pop and R&amp;B charts, supported by a Miami Vice-inspired music video. In addition to Chaka Khan, contributing artists include Jennifer Holliday, Kashif and Robbie Buchanan.
Critical reception.
In a retrospective review, William Ruhlmann of AllMusic found that "Take No Prisoners" "represented a missed opportunity for Bryson, even though he sang with his usual assurance, the material was of good quality, and the production was sympathetic."

Andrea Galer

Andrea Galer is a British costume designer who works in film and television. She began her first project with the film "Don't Look Now" (1973), and has spent much of her career since then working in the genre of period film. These include three films related to Jane Austen, and other productions set in the 19th-century including "Firelight" (1997), "Eroica" (2003), and "The Way We Live Now" (2001).
She won the BAFTA for Best Costume Design for her work in the BBC serial "Bleak House" (2005), and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Costumes for a Miniseries, Movie, or Special for the BBC serial "Jane Eyre" (2006).
Career.
Galer began her career in the 1970s; she worked in commercial design as well as in costume design, creating outfits for stage, film and television. Designing clothing for the actress Julie Christie led to Galer's first film project, the thriller "Don't Look Now" (1973), where she collaborated with fellow costume designer Marit Allen. After the project, Galer took a ten-year break from her career to have children, returning in the mid-1980s.
Galer's use of tweed as a fabric in "Don't Look Now" was repeated in her later projects, including in the British comedy "Withnail and I" (1987). "Withnail and I" is now regarded as a cult film, with fans frequently replicating Galer's Harris Tweed coat worn by the titular character (played by Richard E. Grant). She based her design on a riding coat from the 19th-century. The garment's popularity led to its inclusion in a charity auction in 2000 to raise funds for a school in Swaziland that Grant had previously attended, and to replicas being sold on Galer's website.
While working on the period film "Firelight" (1997) Galer took inspiration from the novel "Jane Eyre", explaining that its "script and direction meant that I intentionally tried to create costumes that emphasised the narrative’s resemblance to "Jane Eyre"". She next designed the costumes in the 1999 film "Mansfield Park", an adaptation of the novel by Jane Austen. In the film, Galer dresses the protagonist Fanny Price (played by Frances O'Connor) in practical, dark materials, setting her apart from her frivolous cousins. For research, she studied the time period and then made slight alterations for modern appeal, primarily by making the costumes more flattering with a slimmer silhouette.
In 2001, Galer served as the costume designer for the BBC serial "The Way We Live Now", set in England during the late 19th century. Another film project set in the 19th-century was "Eroica" (2003); her costumes for the film were described by "Variety" magazine as "both natural and eye-catching". For her work in the BBC serial "Bleak House" (2005), she won the British Academy Television Craft Award for Best Costume Design and received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Costumes for a Miniseries, Movie, or Special.
Galer was the costume designer for the 2006 BBC miniseries "Jane Eyre", for which she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Costumes for a Miniseries, Movie, or Special. In a 2014 retrospective of the production, Galer said she typically performs research for a project by reading books and visiting art galleries and museums. "When you’ve amassed all this material, you put together mood boards and hope that your inspirations will flow across into your costumes," she said. With "Jane Eyre", she studied portraits of Charlotte Brontë and was inspired by one of them to dress the titular protagonist (played by Ruth Wilson) in a grey silk dress and a vivid red tie; Galer reflected that she "put the 
most time and money into this particular costume".
Galer worked on another Austen adaptation, the ITV television film "Persuasion", in 2007. Galer chose to dress the protagonist Anne Elliot in simple, understated designs, in contrast with those around her. Her costumes in the film were described by "The Hollywood Reporter" as being "equally [as] handsome" as its production design.
Galer has also worked as a fashion designer, creating women's suits, evening wear, and fashion collections based on her costume designs. "The Guardian" describes her style as "based on corsetry and traditional tailoring, [which] her look translates well into film: a model of cross-fertilisation, Galer's contemporary clothing influences her costume, which in turn has an impact on her main collections."
Personal life.
In 2005 she visited Sri Lanka to help the women who worked in the country's lace-making industry, which had been devastated by the 2004 tsunami. She founded the Power of Hands Foundation, a charity that supports women in the lace-making profession by offering operational support and advocating for a fair wage. She has used them as a source for fabric in such productions as "Jane Eyre" and "Miss Austen Regrets".
In 2007 Galer publicly criticised television producers for perceived budget cuts in the area of costume design, writing that "people seem to underestimate the contribution of costume to the success of a picture and feel that corners can be cut. Often what is written in the script simply does not tally with what is available in the budget. It means that in future, period productions are really going to struggle". In the early 2010s, she collaborated with the Jane Austen Centre and a forensic artist to design a costume for a wax figure of the famous British author; it went on display to the public in 2014 in Bath, Somerset.
