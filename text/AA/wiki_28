Benefits of space exploration

As the space race came to an end, a new one rationale for investment in space exploration emerged, focused on the pragmatic use of space for improving life on Earth. As the justification for government-funded space programs shifted to "the public good", space agencies began to articulate and measure the wider socio-economic benefits that might derive from their activities, including both the direct and indirect (or less obvious) benefits of space exploration. However, such programs have also been criticized with several drawbacks cited.
Direct and indirect benefits of space exploration.
Space agencies, governments, researchers and commentators have isolated a large number of direct and indirect benefits of space exploration programs including:
In an attempt to quantify the benefits derived from space exploration, NASA calculated that 444,000 lives have been saved, 14,000 jobs have been created, $5 billion dollars in revenue has been generated, and there has been $6.2 billion in cost reductions due to spin-off programs from NASA research. NASA states that among the many spin-off technologies that have come out of the space exploration program, there have been notable advancements in the fields of health and medicine, transportation, public safety, consumer goods, energy and environment, information technology, and industrial productivity. Solar panels, water-purification systems, dietary formulas and supplements, material science innovation, and global search and rescue systems are some of the ways in which these technologies have diffused into everyday life.
Satellite technology.
The development of artificial satellite technology was a direct result of space exploration. Since the first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1,) was launched by the USSR on October 4, 1957, thousands of satellites have been put into orbit around the Earth by more than 40 countries. 
These satellites are used for a variety of applications including observation (by both military and civilian agencies), communication, navigation, and weather monitoring. Space stations, space telescopes and spacecraft in orbit around the Earth are also regarded as satellites. 
Communications satellites.
Communications satellites are used for a variety of purposes including television, telephone, radio, internet and military applications. According to statistics, there were 2,666 active artificial satellites orbiting the Earth in 2020. Of these, 1,327 belonged to the US and 363 to China. Many of these satellites are in geostationary orbit above the equator, so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky. Communications satellites can also be in Medium Earth orbit (known as MEO satellites) with an Orbital altitude ranging from above Earth and low Earth orbit (known as LEO satellites) at above Earth. MEO and LEO orbits are closer to the surface of the Earth and therefore a larger number of satellites are required in such a constellation to provide continuous communications. Satellites are vital for providing communications to remote areas and ships. 
Weather satellites.
The United States, Europe, India, China, Russia, and Japan all have weather satellites in orbit that are used to monitor the weather, environment, and climate of the Earth. Polar-orbiting weather satellites cover the entire Earth asynchronously, or geostationary satellites cover the same spot on the equator. In addition to monitoring weather patterns for forecasting, which is extremely important for certain activities and industries (such as farming and fishing), meteorological satellites monitor fires, pollution, auroras, sand, and dust storms, as well as snow cover and ice mapping. They have also been used to monitor ash clouds from volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens and Mount Etna as well as major weather events such as El Niño and the Antarctic ozone hole. Recently, weather monitoring satellites have also been used to assess the viability of solar panel sites by monitoring cloud cover and weather patterns. Nigeria and South Africa have successfully employed satellite-based disaster management and climate monitoring.
International Space Station.
The International Space Station is a modular space station (habitable artificial satellite) in low Earth orbit that was built by 18 countries including NASA (US), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and the CSA (Canada). The station serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which scientific research is conducted in astrobiology, astronomy, meteorology, physics, and other fields. The ISS is also used for testing spacecraft systems and equipment required for future long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.
Hubble Space Telescope.
The Hubble Space Telescope is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990 by NASA with contributions from the European Space Agency. It was not the first space telescope, but it is one of the largest and most versatile. Its orbit allows it to capture extremely high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes, enabling a deep view into space. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics, such as determining the rate of expansion of the universe.
Knowledge of space.
Since Sputnik 1 entered orbit in 1957 to perform Ionospheric experiments, the human understanding of earth and space has increased. The List of missions to the Moon begin as early as 1958 and continued into the current age. A few successful lunar missions by the USSR include missions such as the Luna 1 spacecraft that completed the first flyby of the moon in 1959, the Luna 3 lunar probe that took the first pictures of the far side of the moon in 1959, the Luna 10 orbiter that was the first orbiter of the moon in 1966, and the Lunokhod 1 lunar rover in 1970, which was the first rover that explored the surface of a world beyond earth. The United States also added significant lunar first, such as Apollo 8 in 1968 is the first successful human mission to orbit the moon and the historic Apollo 11 when humans first landed on the moon. Missions to the moon have collected samples of lunar materials and there are now multiple satellites such as ARTEMIS P1 that currently orbit the moon and collect data. 
Biomedical research.
Beginning in 1967, NASA successfully began its Biosatellite program that initially took frog eggs, amoeba, bacteria, plants and mice and studied the effects of zero gravity on these biological life forms. Studies of human life in space have augmented the understanding of the effects of adjusting to a space environment, such as alterations in body fluids, negative influences on the immune system and effects of space on sleep patterns. Current space research pursuits are divided into the subjects of Space Biology, which studies the effects of space on smaller organisms such as cells, Space Physiology, which is the study of the effects of space on the human body and Space Medicine, which examines the possible dangers of space on the human body. The Canadian science experiments in the cardiovascular system examines how astronauts’ blood vessels change before, during and after missions. The study in space helps understand heart failures and how our arteries age on earth. Space engineers helped design heart pumps now used to keep people in need of heart transplant alive until a donor heart becomes available. Discoveries concerning the human body and space, particularly the effects on the development of bones, may provide further understanding of biomineralization and the process of gene transcription.
Culture and inspiration.
Human Culture exists as a social environment made up by traditions, norms, rules written or unwritten, and social practices. Cultures can be specific to groups of any size such as a family or group of friends but also as large as a state or nation. The range and diversity of human culture is markedly large. International collaboration in the space age brought together different cultures and, as a result, the exchange and advancement of human culture. In over fifty years of space travel, the diversity of those working in space and in the field as a whole has dramatically increased from the beginnings of space exploration. This progression in diversity brought more cultures into close quarters and resulted in the enrichment of human culture globally. 
The innovation and exploration of the space age has served as an inspiration to humankind. Breaking through into space travel, humans leaving Earth and defeating gravity, taking steps on the Moon, and various other achievements were pivotal moments in human cultural development. In particular, the scientific and technological advancements stand as an inspiration to the scientific community of students, teachers, and researchers worldwide. Moreover, space exploration has also inspired innovative training programs aimed at preschoolers, such as the Future Astronauts Program. It is evident that by drawing in the wonder of space together with the knowledge and skills developed through space exploration into classrooms, children can be strongly motivated and empowered from a young age.
Criticisms and drawbacks.
There are three main types of criticism levied against space exploration: the cost, ideological criticism, and social criticism.
The calculations of the benefits of space exploration have frequently been criticized due to a conflict of interests argument (the agencies responsible are the ones who calculate the benefits) and the complexity of quantifying the benefits. As Matthew Williams stated: "How do you put a dollar value on scientific knowledge, inspiration, or the expansion of our frontiers?" 
While some commentators have argued that space exploration is a lifeboat strategy to avoid annihilation of the human race, others have countered that is misses the point. Amitai Etzioni – Professor at The George Washington University and an adviser to the US's Carter administration – countered in "Humanity Would Be Better off Saving Earth, Rather Than Colonizing Mars" that: "It is better to hold off disasters at home than to assume all is lost". Etzioni also pointed out the vast cost of colonization of extraterrestrial planets by citing that Elon Musk, an advocate of space exploration and colonization, had calculated the cost of sending the first 12 astronauts to Mars at £10 billion per person. The Mars Climate Orbiter is a good example of this argument, burning up—before returning any scientific data—at a cost of $328 million.
Social critics say that the cost of space exploration cannot be justified when hunger and poverty are rampant. "As they see it, space exploration takes money, resources, and talent away from helping people in need and from improving the quality of life for everybody." In 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. said: "Without denying the value of scientific endeavor, there is a striking absurdity in committing billions to reach the moon where no people live, while only a fraction of that amount is appropriated to service the densely populated slums." 
Some critics have pointed out the hazards of space debris which affect satellites, spacecraft and the surface of the Earth. For example, in March 2009 debris believed to be a piece of the Kosmos 1275 satellite nearly hit the ISS. Although it is relatively rare for people on the ground to be hit by space debris, it does happen. In 1969 five sailors on a Japanese ship were injured by space debris. In 1997 an Oklahoma woman, Lottie Williams, was injured when she was hit in the shoulder by a piece of blackened, woven metallic material confirmed as part of the propellant tank of a Delta II rocket which launched a U.S. Air Force satellite the year before. Environmentalists have pointed to the pollution caused by space exploration and at distracting Americans from a mounting pollution problem.
Feminists criticized the US space exploration programs, and even filed lawsuits, for sexist hiring practices and all-male astronaut corps.
It is unclear how much the American public agrees with the importance of space exploration. Gallup polls in the 1960s showed that less than 50% of Americans considered the endeavour worth the cost. An NBC News and Associated Press Poll in 1979 found that only 41% of respondents considered the benefits worth the costs.

<doc id="56768643" url="?curid=56768643" title="Morphett Street Brewery">
Morphett Street Brewery

The Morphett Street Brewery was a brewer of beer in Adelaide, South Australia.
History.
John Reid ( – c. 24 November 1863) and Isaiah Reid (c. 1832 – 9 April 1877) had a licensed grocery shop on a half acre of land on Morphett Street near North Terrace in the Adelaide city centre from 1857, then began brewing there from 1859. After the death of his brother, Isaiah Reid took on John Burn Harrison as a partner, then proved insolvent 1866.
In 1868, which may have been Reid's last year of operation, their production was of beer. This made the Morphett Street Brewery the smallest in the city; one third that of Simms &amp; Chapman's West End Brewery and half that of Syme &amp; Sison's Pirie Street Brewery.
Their pale ale was bottled partly by Noltenius and partly by Aldridge. The factory was then taken over by Fred Fuller &amp; Co. who continued operating on the premises until perhaps as late as 1873.
Isaiah Reid later conducted a brewery at Port Augusta. Frederick Robinson Fuller (died 1883) proved insolvent in 1871.
Other breweries.
Other breweries operating in the late 1860s included:

Ardtornish Bay

Ardtornish Bay is coastal embayment, on a chord of 0.89 miles, on a 161° orientation, in the Morvern peninsula in Lochaber, in the western coast of Scotland. There is good anchorage in the bay, with a depth of 7 fathoms. It is well protected, except from winds from the south.
Settlements.
Ardtornish Bay is part of Ardtornish Estate. Ardtornish House is famous for its gardens and the estate is the location of the ruined Ardtornish Castle and the still-inhabited Kinlochaline Castle. Lochaline is the largest settlement in the area, and the main village in the Morvern area, along the A884 road. Fort William is the nearest transport hub.
Geography.
Ardtornish Bay faces the Sound of Mull in a southerly direction, the Sound that runs from Aulston Point and Tobermory in the North to the Rubha Fiart and Duart Point on the Isle of Mull, in the southeast. The small islands of Eilean Rubha an Ridere, that is opposite Inninmore Bay, and Eileanan Glas in the middle of the Sound and Sgeir nan Gobhar off the coast of Mull, can be seen from the bay. 
At the west end of the bay, is Artornish Point, is a small promontory, that is rendered remarkable by the ruins of an ancient castle, celebrated by Sir Walter Scott in one of his poems. The ruins are now inconsiderable, consisting principally of the keep, with traces of outer defences, but of its ancient strength and splendour, no remains can be traced, in the crumbling walls of a small and apparently insignificant building. Within the castle a quarter of a mile, on somewhat higher ground, is Ardtornish house with stables and offices.
To the east of the bay, running in the southeast direction is Aoineadh Beag, the dramatic cliffs of Ardtornish Bay. The cliffs rise to be 300metres before a gentle incline up to the hilltop of Glais Bheinn at 479metres. To the north is the narrow opening of Coalas na h-Àirde into Loch Aline.
An Sleaghach at 515m, is the largest peak in the area, in the west about 4.5 miles to the west, but is not visible from the bay, due to the height of the Aoineadh Beag cliffs.

Honeymoon in a Balloon

L'Ascension de la rosière, released in the United States as Honeymoon in a Balloon and in Britain as The Ascension of a Communicant, was a 1908 French short silent comedy film directed by Georges Méliès.
Plot.
At a May Day festival, a young bride-to-be is crowned the May Queen. Her bridegroom decides to take a flight with a balloonist who has set up at a nearby fairground. The bride, running to join him, arrives just as the balloon is lifting off; not quite able to get into the basket, she is caught by the balloon's anchor as it floats into the clouds. Onlookers, realizing what has happened, make a mad dash to keep up with the balloon, but their hectic chase proves futile. Bride and balloon make a crash landing through the ceiling of a large hall, where the town mayor and his worthies are banqueting. The couple are finally reunited, and the bride has her May Queen crown of flowers restored to her as all celebrate the safe conclusion of the adventure.
Release.
The film was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 1347–1352 in its catalogues. It is currently presumed lost.

Louisa Barnewall Van Rensselaer

Louisa Barnewall Van Rensselaer (October 12, 1836 – July 3, 1920), was a prominent member of New York Society during the Gilded Age.
Early life.
Louisa was born on October 12, 1836 in New York City. She was the daughter of William Barnewall (1792–1874), an attorney, and Clementina (née Rutgers) Barnewall (1800–1838), who married in 1818. After her mother's death when Louisa was only 2 years old, her father remarried to Anne Coles (1808–1885). Among her siblings was Elizabeth Barnewall (1825–1867), who married Alfred Schermerhorn; Morris Barnewall (1834–1895), who married Eliza Antoinette Hall.
Her maternal grandparents were Nicholas Gouverneur Rutgers, an attorney, and Cornelia (née Livingston) Rutgers.
Society life.
In 1892, Louisa (who at that point was a widow following her husband's death in 1878) along with her two unmarried daughters Mabel and Alice, and her married daughter Louisa and her husband Edmund, were all included in Ward McAllister's "Four Hundred", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in "The New York Times". Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom.
Personal life.
On June 30, 1864, Louisa married Alexander Van Renssalaer (1814–1878). Alexander was the youngest surviving son born to Stephen Van Rensselaer, the patroon of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck and Cornelia (née Paterson) Van Renssalaer, the daughter of William Paterson, the 2nd Governor of New Jersey, and later, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Alexander was the widower of Mary Howland (d. 1855), daughter of Samuel Shaw Howland, whom he married in 1851. She lived at 12 East 37th Street in Manhattan and at "Gortmore" in Southampton, New York. Together, Alexander and Louisa were the parents of three children:
Her husband died on May 8, 1878. She died at Woodmere on Long Island on July 3, 1920, and was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

Siege of Johor (1587)

The Siege of Johor of 1587 was a military operation in which Portuguese forces successfully sieged, sacked, and razed Johor ("Jor", in Portuguese), capital of its eponymous Sultanate. The city would later be rebuilt in a different location.
Because of a dearth of personnel then available in Malacca, in 1586 naval forces of Johore had begun diverting shipping to the Strait of Singapore. Malacca itself was threatened by a large Johor fleet, but it was driven back by the presence of heavily armed Portuguese galleons in its harbour. For these reasons, the captain of Malacca João da Silva requested from the Viceroy in Goa, Dom Duarte de Meneses, urgent reinforcements to deal with the threat. These numbered 500 men and 3 galleons, under the command of Dom Paulo de Lima.
The forces of Johor were incapable of preventing the heavy Portuguese infantry from landing and storming the city after a naval bombardment, and its Sultan was forced to retreat into the jungle in a rout. The Portuguese captured ample spoils, which included over 1,000 cannon, the great majority of them of small caliber, 1,500 firearms, and burned upwards of 2,000 craft of many sizes. Following the attack, Dom Pedro de Lima (brother of Dom Paulo de Lima) also sacked Bintan, then a vassal of Johor.

1980 UK Athletics Championships

The 1980 UK Athletics Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Crystal Palace Athletics Stadium, London. Three events were contested separately at Meadowbank Stadium, Edinburgh – the women's 1500 metres and men's 800 metres and 5000 metres. This set of events served as the British Olympic Team Trials for the 1980 Summer Olympics. Two new events were contested for the first time: a men's 10,000 metres track walk and a women's 5000 metres track walk.
It was the fourth edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1980 AAA Championships.
Women's discus thrower Meg Ritchie took a record fourth consecutive UK title. David Ottley won a third straight title in the javelin throw. Five other athletes defended their 1979 titles: Gary Oakes in the 400 metres hurdles, Heather Hunte in the women's 100 m, Christina Boxer in the women's 800 m, Shirley Strong in the women's 100 metres hurdles and Angela Littlewood in the women's shot put. Two athletes achieved a championship double: Cameron Sharp edged out Drew McMaster in both the men's 100 metres and 200 metres, and David Moorcroft claimed a 1500/5000 m double.
At the 1980 Moscow Olympics, one participant at the UK trials won an individual medal – hurdles champion Gary Oakes took Olympic bronze. The four women who took the top three in the short sprints (Hunte, Kathy Smallwood, Beverley Goddard, and Sonia Lannaman) combined to win an Olympic bronze in the 4 × 100 metres relay, and the top three in the women's 400 metres (Linsey Macdonald, Joslyn Hoyte-Smith and Michelle Probert) joined Donna Hartley to take the 4 × 400 metres relay Olympic bronze. Allan Wells, Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Daley Thompson made the 1980 Olympic podium, but were not present at this national event.

Grant Williams (basketball)

Grant Dean Williams (born November 30, 1998) is an American professional basketball player for the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Tennessee Volunteers. A 6'7" power forward from Charlotte, North Carolina, he was drafted 22nd overall in the 2019 NBA draft.
College career.
Williams was an All-Southeastern Conference player as a freshman, sophomore, and junior. He was awarded back-to-back SEC Player of the Year honors for the 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons, becoming the first player to do so since Corliss Williamson in 1995. He led Tennessee to a #3-seed in the 2018 NCAA Tournament and #2-seed in the 2019 NCAA Tournament. He is recognized by most Volunteer fans as the greatest player in Tennessee history.
Professional career.
Boston Celtics (2019–present).
Williams was selected with the 22nd overall draft pick by the Boston Celtics in the 2019 NBA draft. On July 11, 2019, the Boston Celtics announced that they had signed Williams to a four-year, $11.8 million rookie-scale contract. On October 23, 2019, Williams made his NBA debut, coming off the bench in a 93–107 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers with a rebound. While not always playing a ton of minutes, Williams found himself a spot in the rotation as a solid, literally and figuratively, face-up defender, rebound chaser, and energy provider. On December 4, 2019, Williams made his first career start in a winning effort against the Miami Heat where he didn't do much statistically in 17 minutes. Only a few weeks later, in some extended run during a blowout win against the Detroit Pistons, Williams dropped a career high 18 points on 8-10 shooting. In an effort to garner support for his teammates making the NBA All-Star Game, Grant pledged to dye his hair pink if Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Kemba Walker all made the all-star game. He finished his rookie season averaging just over 15 minutes per game in 69 contests where he chipped in 3.4 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
Personal life.
Williams' mother, Teresa Johnson, is an electrical engineer who works for NASA. His father, Gilbert, is a jazz artist and former college player who has worked as a bodyguard for musicians including Prince. He is a cousin of former NBA players Salim and Damon Stoudamire. Turning down offers from Ivy League schools Harvard and Yale, Williams graduated from Tennessee in three years with a degree in business. After missing his first 25 career three-point attempts, Williams' Celtics teammates hired the physical tone setter Aron Baynes to inspire Williams."
Williams threw out the first pitch at the Boston Red Sox August 7, 2019 game.

Abundance conjecture

In algebraic geometry, the abundance conjecture is a conjecture in 
birational geometry, more precisely in the minimal model program,
stating that for every projective variety formula_1 with Kawamata log terminal singularities over a field formula_2 if the canonical bundle formula_3 is nef, then formula_3 is semi-ample.
Important cases of the abundance conjecture have been proven by Caucher Birkar.

Sergey Loiko

Sergey Leonidovich Loiko (Russian: "Сергей Леонидович Лойко", born 26 February 1953 in Mikkeli, Finland) is a writer, war photographer, and journalist. As a journalist and photographer he has covered armed conflicts in Russia and the former USSR since 1991 (Romania, Tajikistan, Chechnya, Georgia) working primarily for the "Los Angeles Times". In 2001, Loiko covered the war in Afghanistan and in 2003, the war in Iraq.
In 2004, he published his first book "Shock and Awe, War in Iraq". In 2015, he published "Airport" a book about the battle of Donetsk airport. In 2017, Loiko published "Flight" about the shooting down of MH17.
Loiko was awarded with the 2014 Overseas Press Club’s Bob Considine Award and the 2015 Los Angeles Times Editorial Award. His novels "Airport" (ru: "Аэропорт", 2015; American award Overseas Press Club Bob Considine award) and "Flight" (ru: "Рейс", 2017) are translated into many languages.
Journalistic activity in military zones.
The War in Iraq (2003-2011).
During the Iraq war, Sergei Loiko became one of the most prominent journalists to describe Operation Shock and Shake. His reports for Novaya Gazeta, of which he was a correspondent, were published in the Los Angeles Times, aired on Echo of Moscow, and reprinted in other world publications. Materials from his reports and diary were included in the book "Shock and awe. The War in Iraq ”Novaya Gazeta nominated Serhiy Loyko for the 2003 Union of Journalists of Russia.
Russian-Ukrainian War (2014 ‒).
As a military journalist, photographer and writer, he has been covering the war in eastern Ukraine since 2014. He made a series of reports from Donbass as a correspondent for the Los Angeles Times. Sergei Loiko became the only foreign correspondent to visit the Donetsk airport besieged by Russian militants. At the end of October 2014, he spent four days there among the Ukrainian military and volunteers from the Right Sector, which resulted in an article with a gallery of his own photos on the front page of the Los Angeles Times.
Serhiy Loyko's report on October 29 on Echo of Moscow radio about the fighting around Donetsk airport was considered by Roskomnadzor to justify the practice of war crimes and contradict the Federal Law of July 25, 2002 № 114-FZ "On Countering Extremist Activities." The publication and the Echo of Moscow radio channel, as well as their founder, were warned about the inadmissibility of violating the legislation of the Russian Federation, and a transcript of the interview was immediately removed from the Echo of Moscow website. However, the leaders of "Echo of Moscow" said that they would seek to lift the warning in court.
Serhiy Loyko's materials, shot by him for the Los Angeles Times, received additional publicity due to the fact that his producer Victoria Butenko was nominated for an Emmy Award for a story about the Maidan.
On September 3, 2015, a presentation of Serhiy Loyko's book "Airport" took place in Kyiv. According to the author, he wrote the book about the war between Russia and Ukraine, as "it can not be called otherwise." The author said that he was obsessed with the novel during his stay with the "cyborgs" at the Donetsk airport in October 2014. "From the very beginning, I realized that this must be a novel, because in the chronicle, in the documentary evidence, it is impossible to express the full depth of the tragedy, meanness, heroism, hatred, passion inherent in this war. I could not talk about her in a cold, detached tone of a chronicler, "Loiko wrote in his blog in the publication" New Time ".
On March 15, 2018, the premiere of Serhiy Loyko's television documentary four-episode series "Hybrid History" about the events of recent years in eastern Ukraine took place on the Pryamiy channel.
On April 2, 2019, on the Russian propaganda TV show "Meeting Place", Serhiy Loiko gave a speech in defense of Euromaidan. After the speech, Russian propagandist and host Andrei Norkin disappeared from the studio. As it became known later, the propagandist had a hypertensive crisis and was in hospital at the time of his death.
Awards.
In 2015, for his work in the war in Ukraine, Sergei Loiko was awarded one of the highest awards in American journalism - the Overseas Press Club Bob Considine award "for courage, authenticity, originality, depth and expressiveness of what was described." In the same year, Sergei was awarded the prestigious Los Angeles Times editorial award for "best reports of 2014".
In 2017, the book "Airport" was nominated for the National Prize of Ukraine named after Taras Shevchenko in the category of literature.

SS Robert Wallace

SS "Robert Wallace" was a wooden-hulled American bulk freighter that served on the Great Lakes of North America from her construction in 1882 to her sinking in 1902 on Lake Superior near the town of Palmers, St. Louis County, Minnesota, United States. On November 17, 1902 shortly after leaving Superior, Wisconsin with a cargo of iron ore, "Robert Wallace" sprang a leak and sank. Her wreck was found in 2006, and on October 14, 2009, the wreck of "Robert Wallace" was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
"Robert Wallace" (Official number 110518) was built in 1882 by William H. Radcliffe of Cleveland, Ohio, for David Wallace of Lorain, Ohio. Her homeport was Lorain. She had a length of , a beam of , and she had a depth. She was powered by a small 550 horsepower compound steam engine and fueled by a single coal-fired Scotch marine boiler. She had a gross tonnage of 1189.56 tons and a net tonnage of 905.38 tons. She was launched at 2:30P.M. on April 13, 1882. She usually carried bulk cargoes such as iron ore, coal and grain.
On August 2, 1883, "Robert Wallace" was towing the schooner barge "J.M. Hill" when she and "J.M. Hill" were struck by lightning in the Milwaukee harbour. Both the "Robert Wallace" and the "J.M. Hill" had their foremasts heavily damaged.
On November 18, 1886, "Robert Wallace" was towing her schooner barge "David Wallace" (which was named after Robert Wallace's brother) when she stranded near Marquette, Michigan. "Robert Wallace" eventually caught fire and burned down. This incident almost ended her career but she was pulled off and repaired.
On November 12, 1891, "Robert Wallace" ran aground because of low water in the Sheboygan Harbor. She was loaded with a cargo of coal at the time of the incident. She was also towing "David Wallace" which was carrying 1,500 tons of coal and also ran aground.
On October 22, 1896, the boilers of "Robert Wallace" started to leak and they needed to be repaired so that she could continue her journey. She was repaired in Harbor Beach, Michigan.
Sinking.
On November 17, 1902, "Robert Wallace" departed the ore docks in Superior, Wisconsin laden with a cargo of iron ore. She was also towing the schooner barge "Ashland", which was also full of iron ore. About four hours after their departure "Robert Wallace" sprang a leak and started sinking. Accounts differ on what caused the leak. Some accounts claim that "Robert Wallace" struck a floating log, others claim "Ashland" pulled off her stern post. Her crew was transferred to "Ashland" which then sailed to Two Harbors, Minnesota, and was towed to safety by the steel hulled tug "Edna G". Even though "Robert Wallace" was loaded with iron she sank quite slowly. Hours after her crew abandoned her, "Robert Wallace" continued to float on the surface of Lake Superior with her lights still on. Even when she sank her pilothouse broke off and continued to float on the surface.
"Robert Wallace" wreck.
Discovery.
The remains of "Robert Wallace" remained undiscovered until 2006 when an unidentified diver discovered the wreck near the shipping lanes. The diver reported the location of her wreck to diver Jay Hanson, who conducted a dive with wreck hunter Ken Merryman in 2006; in 2007 Hanson and Merryman captured video footage of the wreck. Later, Merryman and diver Bob Olson identified her wreck after seeing her name, still painted in white lettering on her stern.
"Robert Wallace" today.
The wreck of "Robert Wallace" rests relatively intact in of water about south of Knife River, Minnesota. Close by are the wrecks of several ships including the wreck of the iron hulled steamer "Onoko", the steel hulled package freighter "Benjamin Noble", and the wooden hulled rafting tug "Niagara", all of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The wreck of "Robert Wallace" is the most intact known wooden-hulled bulk freighter in Minnesota waters. Her hull is separated about at the stem, which makes exploring her wreck easier. Numerous artifacts lie outside the wreck; it is illegal to remove any artifacts because she is protected by the state of Minnesota. Her stern, however, remains intact, disproving the theory that "Ashland" pulled off her stern post.
The wreck was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009 for its state-level significance in the themes of commerce, engineering, historical archaeology, and maritime history. It was nominated for its significant research potential on the formative design and shipboard life of the first lake freighters.

PAA (test)

The PAA or Prueba de Aptitud Académica is an educational assessment that is used to help universities across Latin America select incoming students. More specifically, it is a standardized test for university admissions. It is offered by College Board Puerto Rico y America Latina (CBPRAL), part of the College Board. The PAA is not a translation of the Scholastic Aptitude Test used in the United States and it is developed independently from the SAT, even though the PAA measures the same constructs as the SAT. While the CBPRAL is based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the PAA is delivered in a range of Spanish-speaking countries.
The third generation of the PAA assesses students on three components: Verbal Reasoning, Mathematical Reasoning, and Indirect Writing. Scores on each section range from 200 to 800. The fourth generation of the PAA, launched in Puerto Rico in December 2017, assesses three components: Reading and Writing, Mathematics, and English as a Second Language. A 200- to 800-point scale is used for each component. This use of scaled scoring for a test score is typical of many assessments, as it facilitates score reporting after test equating.
Research has supported the reliability and validity of the PAA.

Harry Dack

Harry Dack (1877–1954) was a British trade unionist and politician.
Born in Loftus-by-Cleveland, Dack received a basic education at Skinningrove Council School but, while still a child, began working in the local ironstone mines.
In 1902, Dack was elected as a checkweighman, and the following year, he was elected to the executive committee of the Cleveland Miners' and Quarrymen's Association. In 1911, he became the president and full-time agent of the union. He represented the union on various bodies, including serving on the executive of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, attending the Trades Union Congress and Labour Party conferences, and three international conferences of miners: in Brussels in 1910, Carlsbad in 1913, and Prague in 1925.
At the 1918 United Kingdom general election, Dack stood as the Labour Party candidate for Cleveland, taking a close second place, with 35.3% of the vote. He stood again in 1922, but dropped back to third, with 29.5% of the votes cast. He continued political activity at a more local level, serving on both North Riding County Council and the Guisborough Board of Guardians from 1924. From 1930, he instead served on the county council as an alderman, and during the 1930s chaired the council's Agricultural Wages Committee and Public Assistance Committee.
The miners' association became part of the National Union of General and Municipal Workers in 1932, but retained significant autonomy even after the merger, with Dack continuing as a full-time agent until his retirement in 1936.
In 1934, Dack was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, while in the early 1950s, the Harry Dack Infants School in Loftus was named after him.

Taoist philosophy

Taoist philosophy (Chinese: ; pinyin: '; ) also known as Taology refers to the various philosophical currents of Taoism, a tradition of Chinese origin which emphasizes living in harmony with the "Dào" (, also romanized as "Tao"). The ' is a mysterious and deep principle that is the source, pattern and substance of the entire universe.
Since the initial stages of Taoist thought, there have been varying schools of Taoist philosophy and they have drawn from and interacted with other philosophical traditions such as Confucianism and Buddhism. Taoism differs from Confucianism in putting more emphasis on physical and spiritual cultivation and less emphasis on political organization. Throughout its history, Taoist philosophy has emphasised concepts like "wúwéi" ("effortless action"), "zìrán" (, "natural authenticity"), "qì" ("spirit"), "wú" ("non-being"), "wújí" ("non-duality"), "tàijí" ("polarity") and "yīn-yáng" (), "biànhuà" ("transformation") and "fǎn" ("reversal"), and personal cultivation through meditation and other spiritual practices.
While scholars have sometimes attempted to separate "Taoist philosophy" from "Taoist religion", there was never really such a separation. Taoist texts and the literati and Taoist priests that wrote and commented on them never made the distinction between "religious" and "philosophical" ideas, particularly those related to metaphysics and ethics.
The principle texts of this philosophical tradition are traditionally seen as the Daodejing, and the Zhuangzi, though it was only during the Han Dynasty that they were grouped together under the label "Taoist" ("Daojia"). The I Ching was also later linked to this tradition by scholars such as Wang Bi. Additionally, around 1,400 distinct texts have been collected together as part of the Taoist canon ("Dàozàng").
Early sources.
Compared to other philosophical traditions, Taoist philosophy is quite heterogeneous. According to Russell Kirkland, "Taoists did not generally regard themselves as followers of a single religious community that shared a single set of teachings, or practices." Instead of drawing on a single book or the works of one founding teacher, Taoism developed out a widely diverse set of Chinese beliefs and texts, that over time were gathered together into various synthetic traditions. These texts had some things in common, especially ideas about personal cultivation and integration with what they saw as the deep realities of life.
The first group consciously identifying itself as "Taoist" ("") appeared and began to collect texts during the fifth century BCE. Their collection of Taoist texts did not initially include classics typically considered to be "Taoist" like the Tao Te Ching and the Zhuangzi. Only after a later expansion of the canon did these texts become included.
The legend of the "person" Laozi was developed during the Han dynasty and has no historical validity. Likewise the labels Taoism and Confucianism were developed during the Han dynasty by scholars to group together various thinkers, and texts of the past and categorize them as "Taoist", even though they are quite diverse and their authors may never have known of each other. Thus, while there was never a coherent "school" of "classical Taoism" during the pre-Han eras, later self identified Taoists (c. 500 BCE) were influenced by streams of thought, practices and frameworks inherited from the period of the hundred schools of thought (6th century to 221 BCE). According to Russell Kirkland, these independent influences include:
Ideas in Taoist classics.
The "Daodejing" (also known as the "Laozi" after its purported author, terminus ante quem 3rd-century BCE) has traditionally been seen as the central and founding Taoist text, though historically, it is only one of the many different influences on Taoist thought, and at times, a marginal one at that. The "Daodejing" changed and developed over time, possibly from a tradition of oral sayings, and is a loose collection of aphorisms on various topics which seek to give the reader wise advice on how to live and govern, and also includes some metaphysical speculations. The "Daodejing" prominently refers to a subtle universal phenomenon or cosmic creative power called ' (literally "way" or "road"), using feminine and maternal imagery to describe it. ' is the natural spontaneous way that things arise and exist, it is the "organic order" of the universe. The "Daodejing" distinguishes between the ‘named '’ and the ‘true '’ which cannot be named ("" ) and cannot be captured by language.
The "Daodejing" also mentions the concept of ' (effortless action), which is illustrated with water analogies (going with the flow of the river instead of against) and "encompasses shrewd tactics—among them “feminine wiles”— which one may utilize to achieve success". ' is associated with yielding, minimal action and softness. ' is the activity of the ideal sage ('), who spontaneously and effortlessly express ' (virtue), acting as one with the universal forces of the ', resembling children or un-carved wood ("pu"). They concentrate their internal energies, are humble, pliable and content and move naturally without being restricted by the structures of society and culture. The "Daodejing" also provides advice for rulers, such as never standing out, keeping weapons but not using them, keeping the people simple and ignorant and working in subtle unseen ways instead of forceful ones. It has generally been seen as promoting minimal government.
Like the "Daodejing", the lesser known "Neiye" is short wisdom sayings text. However, the "Neiye" focuses on Taoist cultivation ("xiū", ) of the heartmind ("xīn", ), which involves the cultivation and refinement of the three treasures: "jīng" (“vital essence”), "qì" (“spirit”), and "shén" (“soul”). The "Neiyes idea of a pervasive and unseen "spirit" called "qì" and its relationship to acquiring ' (virtue or inner power) was very influential for later Taoist philosophy. Similarly, important Taoist ideas such as the relationship between a person's ' (“inner nature”, ) and their "mìng" (“personal fate”, ) can be found in another lesser known text called the Lüshi Chunqiu. In these texts, as well as in the "Daodejing", a person who acquires ' and has a balanced and tranquil heartmind is called a ' (“sage”). According to Russell Kirkland: The “heart/mind” is the ruling agency within an individual’s biospiritual nexus, i.e., in the entire personal complex of body/mind/heart/spirit. The "Neiye"’s principal teaching is that a person should work constantly to ensure that his/her “heart/mind” is balanced and tranquil—without excessive cogitation or emotion. If one maintains a tranquil “heart/ mind,” one will become a receptor of life’s healthful energies, and will be able to retain them and live a long life.Another text called the "Zhuangzi" is also seen as a classic of Taoism though it was also often a marginal work for Chinese Taoists. It contains various ideas such as the idea that society and morality is a relative cultural construct, and that the sage is not bound by such things and lives, in a sense, beyond them. The Zhuangzi's vision for becoming a sage requires one to empty oneself of conventional social values and cultural ideas and to cultivate '. Some scholars see primitivist ideas in the Zhuangzi, advocating a return to simpler forms of life.
According to Kirkland what these three texts have in common is the idea that "one can live one’s life wisely only if one learns how to live in accord with life’s unseen forces and subtle processes, not on the basis of society’s more prosaic concerns". These subtle forces include "qí", "shén", and "".
Later Taoists incorporated concepts from the I Ching, like "tiān" (heaven). According to Livia Kohn, "" is "a process, an abstract representation of the cycles and patterns of nature, a nonhuman force that interacted closely with the human world in a nonpersonal way."
Han and Jin Dynasties.
The term "Daojia" (usually translated as "philosophical Taoism") was coined during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) by scholars and bibliographers to refer to a grouping of classic texts like the Daodejing and the Zhuangzi. Though there were no self termed "Taoists" during the Han dynasty, ideas which were later important to "Taoists" can be seen in Han texts such as the "Huainanzi" and the "Taipingjing". For example, according to the "Taipingjing", the ideal ruler maintains an "air" (') of "great peace" (') through the practice of "wúwéi", meditation, longevity practices such as breath control and medicinal practices like acupuncture. There also commentaries written on the classics, the earliest commentary on the "Daodejing" is that of Heshang Gong (the "Riverside Master").
Another influence to the development of later Taoism was "Huáng-Lǎo" (literally: "Yellow [Emperor] Old [Master]"), one of the most influential Chinese school of thought in the early Han dynasty (2nd-century BCE). It was a syncretist philosophy which brought together texts and elements from many schools. Huang–Lao philosophy was favoured at the Western Han, before the reign of Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BCE) who made Confucianism the official state philosophy. These intellectual currents helped inspire several new social movements such as the Way of the Celestial Masters which would later influence Taoist thought.
The fourth century saw major developments such as the rise of new spiritual traditions like the Shangqing ("Supreme Clarity") and Lingbao ("Numinous Treasure") with new scriptures and practices such as alchemy and visualization meditations as a way of moral and spiritual refinement. It was the Lingbao school who also developed the ideas of a great cosmic deity as a personification of the Tao and a heavenly order with Mahayana Buddhist influences. The Shangqing school is the beginning of the Taoist tradition known as “inner alchemy” ("neidan"), a form of physical and spiritual self cultivation.
It was in the later fifth century that an aristocratic scholar called Lu Xiujing (406–477) drew on all these disparate influences to shape and produce a common set of beliefs, texts and practices for what he called "the teachings of the Tao” (""). In the north, another influential figure, Kou Qianzhi (365–448), reformed the celestial master school, producing a new ethical code.
Xuanxue.
Xuanxue (lit. "mysterious" or "deep" learning, sometimes called Neo-Taoism")" was an important school of thought from the 3rd to 6th-century CE. Xuanxue philosophers combined elements of Confucianism and Taoism to reinterpret the "Yijing," "Daodejing," and "Zhuangzi." Influential Xuanxue scholars include Wang Bi (226–249), He Yan (d. 249), Xiang Xiu (223?–300, part of the famous intellectual group known as the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove), Guo Xiang (d. 312), and Pei Wei (267–300).
Thinkers like He Yan and Wang Bi set forth the theory that everything, including "yīn" and "yáng" and the virtue of the sage, “have their roots" in "wú" (nothingness, negativity, not-being). What He Yan seems to mean by "" can be variously described as formlessness and undifferentiated wholeness. Wu is property-less and yet full and fecund.
Wang Bi's commentary has traditionally been the most influential philosophical commentary on the "Daodejing". Like He Yan, Wang Bi focuses on the concept of ' (non-being, nothingness) as the nature of the Tao and underlying ground of existence. Wang Bi's view of ' is that it is "not being as a necessary basis of being". For being to be possible, there must be not-being, and as the "Daodejing" states, “Dao gives birth to ['] one” and “all things in the world are born of something ('); something is born of nothing ("")”. Wang Bi's account focuses on this foundational aspect of not-being. According to Livia Kohn, for Wang Bi "nonbeing is at the root of all and needs to be activated in a return to emptiness and spontaneity, achieved through the practice of nonaction, a decrease in desires and growth of humility and tranquility". Another critical concept for Xuanxue philosophers is "zìrán" (, natural authenticity).
Guo Xiang is also another influential Xuanxue thinker. In his commentary to the Zhuangzi, he rejected that "wu" was the source of the generation of beings, instead arguing for spontaneous “self-production” (' ) and “self-transformation” (' ) or “lone-transformation” ("" ):“Because "wu" [by definition] is not being, it cannot produce being. Prior to the coming to be of being, it cannot produce other beings. In that case, then, who or what brought about the birth of being? [The answer can only be that] beings are spontaneously self-generated”Another key figure, Taoist alchemist Ge Hong () was an aristocrat and government official during the Jin Dynasty who wrote the classic known as the Baopuzi ("Master Embracing Simplicity"), a key Taoist philosophical work of this period. This text includes Confucian teachings and also spiritual practices meant to aid in attaining immortality and a heavenly state called "great clarity", which had great influence on later Taoism.
A later Xuanxue thinker, Zhang Zhan (), is known particularly for his commentary on the Liezi. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties (420–589), "Xuanxue" reached the height of influence as it was admitted into the official curriculum of the imperial academy.
Tang dynasty.
By Tang dynasty times (618–907 CE), a common sense of a "Taoist identity" had developed (which Tang leaders called ', "teachings of the Tao"), partly by the efforts of systematisers like Lu Xiujing and also due to the need to compete against Buddhism for imperial patronage. This synthetic system is sometimes called the Three Caverns. They collected the first Taoist canon, often called “The Three Arcana” ("san-dong", ), which did not originally include the "Daodejing". Taoism also gained official status in China during the Tang Dynasty, whose emperors claimed Laozi as their relative. The Gaozong Emperor even added the "Daodejing" to the list of classics (', ) to be studied for the imperial examinations. This was the height of Taoist influence in Chinese history.
Sima Chengzhen (647—735 CE) is an important intellectual figure of this period. He is especially known for blending Taoist, and Buddhist theories and forms of mental cultivation in the Taoist meditation text called the "Zuowanglun." He also served as an adviser to the Tang government. He was later retroactively appropriated as a patriarch of the Quanzhen school.
Another key Taoist writer and thinker of this period is Du Guangting (850—933 CE), he produced an influential commentary on the Daodejing as well as numerous expositions of other scriptures and histories. Likewise, Taoist master Cheng Xuanying () wrote an influential commentaries on the "Daodejing" and "Zhuangzi".
Song dynasty.
The Song dynasty (960–1279) era saw the foundation of the Quanzhen (Complete perfection or Integrating perfection) school of Taoism during the 12th century among followers of Wang Chongyang (1113–1170), a scholar who wrote various collections of poetry and texts on living a Taoist life who taught that taught that the "three teachings" (Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism), "when investigated, prove to be but one school". The Quanzhen school was syncretic, combining elements from Buddhism (such as monasticism) and Confucianism with past Taoist traditions.
"Neidan", a form of internal alchemy, became a major emphasis of the Quanzhen sect. Wang Chongyang taught that “immortality of the soul” (', ) can be attained within this life by entering seclusion, cultivating one's “internal nature” (', ), and harmonizing them with one's “personal fate” ("mìng-yùn", )." He taught that, by mental training and asceticism through which one reaches a state of no-mind ("wú-xīn", ) and no-thoughts, attached to nothing, one can recover the primordial, deathless "radiant spirit" or "true nature" (' , ' ).
According to Stephen Eskildsen, Wang Chongyang appears to have been familiar with and influenced by Mahayana Buddhist texts like the Diamond sutra as well as Chan texts, however:
One Quanzhen master, Qiu Chuji, became a teacher of Genghis Khan before the establishment of the Yuan Dynasty. Originally from Shanxi and Shandong, the sect established its main center in Beijing's Baiyunguan ("White Cloud Monastery"). Several Song emperors, most notably Huizong, were active in promoting Taoism, collecting Taoist texts and publishing editions of the "Daozang."
Yuan and Ming dynasties.
The Yuan and Ming government meanwhile often attempted to control and regulate Taoism. Taoism suffered a significant setback during the reign of Kublai Khan when many copies of the "Daozang" were ordered burned in 1281. This destruction gave Taoism a chance to renew itself. Chinese Taoists during the 12–14th centuries engaged in a revaluation of their tradition, dubbed by some a "reformation", which focused on individual cultivation.
During the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), the state promoted the notion that “the Three Teachings (Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism) are one”, an idea which over time became popular consensus. The current Taoist textual canon, called the Daozang, was compiled during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Moreover, during the Ming dynasty, Taoist ideas also influenced Neo-Confucian thinkers like Wang Yangming and Zhan Ruoshui.
Qing dynasty and modern China.
The late Ming and early Qing dynasty saw the rise of the Longmen ("Dragon Gate" ) school of Taoism, founded by Wang Kunyang (d. 1680) which reinvigorated the Quanzhen tradition. Longmen Taoist writers such as Liu Yiming (1734–1821) also simplified Taoist “Inner Alchemy” practices making more accessible to the public by removing much of the esoteric symbolism of medieval texts. It was Min Yide (1758–1836) though that became the most influential figure of the Longmen lineage, as he was the main compiler of the Longmen "Daozang xubian" and doctrine. It was Min Yide who also made the famous text known as The Secret of the Golden Flower along with its emphasis on internal alchemy, the central doctrinal scripture of the Longmen tradition.
The fall of the Ming Dynasty was blamed by some Chinese literati on Taoist influences and therefore they sought to return to a pure form of Han Confucianism during a movement called "Hanxue", or "Han Learning" which excluded Taoism. The study and practice of Taoist philosophy saw a steep decline in the more tumultuous times of the later Qing dynasty. By the beginning of the twentieth century, Taoism had declined considerably, and only one complete copy of the "Daozang" still remained, at the White Cloud Monastery in Beijing.
Taoism continued to decline during the Nationalist government rule, who saw religions as parasitic and reactionary and confiscated temples. Taoist decline was accelerated after the rise of the Communist Party of China. During the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, many Taoist temples and sites were damaged and taoist clergy were sent to labour camps.
Persecution of Taoists stopped in 1979, and many Taoists began reviving their traditions. Subsequently, many temples and monasteries have been repaired and reopened. Taoism is one of five religions recognized by the PRC, which regulates its activities through the China Taoist Association.

Holly Bowling

Holly Bowling (born May 11, 1984) is an American pianist. Classically-trained, she is best known for transcribing the music of Phish and the Grateful Dead into arrangements for solo piano. In 2014, Bowling published her "Jam Transcription" of Phish's famous rendition of "Tweezer" from Lake Tahoe on July 31, 2013. The success of Bowling's "Tahoe Tweezer" ignited her career as a musician.
Her first solo tour began in July 2015. She has released two albums inspired by the music of Phish and the Grateful Dead and is now a well respected and established musician in the psychedelic rock and jamband music scene. Bowling is a frequent guest member of Everyone Orchestra, Phil Lesh &amp; Friends, as well as being a part of Warren Haynes' Christmas Jam for the last two consecutive years. She has performed at Carnegie Hall, Blue Note Jazz Club, The Massey Center, Lockn' Music Festival, Jam Cruise &amp; The Peach Festival. She was named by "Rolling Stone" in November 2016 as one of "Ten New Artists You Need To Know Right Now."
Early life.
Bowling began playing piano at age 5 under the Suzuki Methodology. In 1999, Bowling won the Norbert Mueller Concerto Competition for her performance of Vivace a Concerto for Piano in D Major. by J. Haydn. Bowling earned a Bachelor of Music in Piano Performance from San Francisco State University. While there, Bowling studied under William Corbett Jones. She won both the Ross McKee award and the 2007 Michael Avalos award, the two most coveted prizes in the SFSU Piano Department. Bowling transitioned from her job as a Suzuki Piano instructor for kids into fully dedicating herself to playing live shows in 2015. As of 2017, she has attended over 300 Phish shows during the 2.0 and 3.0 era. She currently resides in San Francisco, California with her husband, Jeffery Bowling, and their dog.
Career.
Bowling's first live performance was in a San Francisco bar during Phish's 2014 Bill Graham Civic Center run. The Tahoe Tweezer (Phish 7/31/13) published on October
28, 2014, has received over 95k views on YouTube. On August 10, 2015, Bowling released her first album "Distillation of a Dream: The Music of Phish Reimagined for Solo Piano," a 14 song, 2 LP set. The 1st LP is recreations of Phish studio performances and the 2nd LP is composed of live Phish Jam Transcriptions. The "Distillation of a Dream" project took 9 months of development. Peter Smolin, of Hornblower Records, helped Bowling launch a Pledge Music campaign to raise $12,000 for funds to cover recording costs, marketing, and royalties which successfully raised $16,500. A portion of album sales went to The Mockingbird Foundation.
There are two approaches Bowling utilizes to adapt a full band's arrangement into a solo composition for the piano. “Jam Teases” are created by transcribing a small section of a song’s jam made famous by Phish or the Grateful Dead. More than 40 songs have now been transcribed as "Jam-Teases." One example is the "Beautiful Jam," played by the Grateful Dead within a “Dark Star” &gt; “Wharf Rat” &gt; “Dark Star” sequence at The Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, New York on 2/18/71. In a “Jam Transcription,” Bowling takes the full live version of a song and transcribes it note for note. To date, she has created four “Jam Transcriptions”: Phish’s "A Song I Heard The Ocean Sing," from SPAC in Saratoga Springs, NY on 6/19/04, "The Wedge," from Northerly Island in Chicago on 7/20/14, "Twist," from Glens Falls Civic Center in Glens Falls, NY on 10/23/13; and the Grateful Dead’s "Eyes of the World," from Freedom Hall in Louisville, KY on 6/18/74.
In 2015, Jambase included Bowling in their "Songs of Their Own" video series featuring her rendition of "Eyes of the World," from Freedom Hall on 6/18/74. In 2016, Bowling released her second album, "Better Left Unsung", which is a collection of classical solo piano arrangements of the Grateful Dead. The album release party for "Better Left Unsung" was held on December 7, 2016, at Phil Lesh’s Terrapin Crossroads. The album was released on December 9, 2016. The night of the album release, Bowling performed with Bob Weir at the Orange Peel in Asheville, North Carolina. "Better Left Unsung" reached its peak position on the Billboard Classical Albums charts at #25.
On January 22, 2017, during her solo tour, Bowling performed an original composition, "Evolution," for the first time. Currently, Bowling has four original compositions in playing rotation on solo tours entitled: "Proxima B," "You Are Not Are You," "Rocket’s Theme," and "Evolution."
In 2018, Bowling's focus shifted from her solo touring career to the formation of a band. The new five-piece band, Ghost Light, began touring in the spring releasing their first album "Best Kept Secrets" on 3/22/2019
Ghost Light.
In early 2018, Bowling, guitarist Tom Hamilton (American Babies/Joe Russo’s Almost Dead), guitarist Raina Mullen (American Babies), bassist Steve Lyons (Nicos Gun), and drummer Scotty Zwang (Dopapod/RAQ) announced they were forming Ghost Light. This improvisational rock jamband is based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the hometown of Hamilton, Mullen, Lyons and Zwang.
Ghost Light began with laying down its foundation in the studio, often working in five-day blocks to develop its improvisational, collaborative material prior to taking it out on the road for a live audience. They originally assembled for a session at a recording studio in Hamilton, Mullen, Lyons and Zwang’s hometown of Philadelphia. Ghost Light’s aim was to “come to the project with fresh ears and no pre-conceived notions.” The quintet developed songs and a musical communication, which then led to a bond and trust between the musicians.
Ghost Light's inaugural tour commenced with a sold out show on March 20, 2018, at Winstons in San Diego, CA. The first half of 2018, will see the band playing well known venues in major markets coast to coast, followed by heavy rotation on the festival circuit including the Peach Music Festival, Lockn’ Festival, Beanstalk Music Festival, Disc Jam, High Sierra Music Festival, and The Werk Out with more to be announced. During the west coast leg of the tour, the band debuted playing an acoustic set as well as special guest, Grahame Lesh, joining them for a song on both nights at Terrapin Crossroads. Along with band originals, the live shows have also featured songs of Grateful Dead, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, Radiohead, Van Halen, Derek &amp; the Dominos, Tears for Fears, Bruce Cockburn, and Father John Misty. The debut record will be released in the second half of the year and will be supported by an extensive tour.

George Henry Jones

George Henry Jones (1884 – December 1958) was a British trade unionist and politician.
Born in Hednesford, Jones began working as a pit-boy at an early age. He became active in the Cannock Chase Miners' Association, and was elected as its president in 1912. In 1914, he became the full-time general secretary and agent for the North Warwickshire Miners' Association, and then in 1919 became general secretary and agent for the larger Warwickshire Miners' Association.
Jones was also active in the Labour Party, serving on Tamworth Town Council, and he stood in the 1922 Tamworth by-election, taking a distant second place, with 31.2% of the vote. Eventually, he served as Mayor of Tamworth. At the 1931 and 1935 United Kingdom general elections, he stood unsuccessfully in Lichfield.
In about 1930, Jones was elected as secretary of the Midland Miners' Federation, to which all his previous unions were affiliated; he remained leader of the Warwickshire Miners. He served on the executive of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB). He remained in post as the MFGB became the National Union of Mineworkers, but left his trade union posts in 1947, to become Labour Director of the West Midlands Coal Board, then in 1950 became its vice-chair. He retired in 1952, although he continued to serve as a part-time member of the board until his death, four years later.

Naval Weapons Systems Training Facility Boardman

The Naval Weapons Systems Training Facility Boardman, informally known as the Boardman Bombing Range, is a military installation south of Boardman, Oregon in the United States. It is used by NAS Whidbey Island as their principal training grounds for testing EA-18G Growler aircraft and for drone testing. It is located about south of the Yakima Training Center, which is used by Joint Base Lewis-McChord for training exercises and about west of the now closed Umatilla Chemical Depot.
The range was established by the U.S. Army Air Force in 1941 as the Arlington Bombing Range, being originally named after Arlington to the west. The range is used frequently throughout the year. Beyond its primary operator at NAS Whidbey Island, the installation is also used by Oregon National Guard units based in Pendleton and Klamath Falls. About half of the original property was distributed to non-military operators when the Air Force transferred the site to the Navy. The range is also an important ecological site, with parts of it being federally protected.
Geography.
The range lies south of Interstate 84 within the Columbia Basin, which is in the rain shadow of the Cascade mountains. Its location in eastern Oregon makes it drier than areas to the west of the mountain range. The area has low vegetation, such as sagebrush and gradually climbs from near the Columbia River in the north to hills in the south which reach an elevation of above sea level. The Boardman Airport was originally built as part of the training range by the Air Force, but has since been turned over to the local government and is currently owned by the Port of Morrow.
The gate for the range is located off of Bombing Range Road, which connects Interstate 84 at its junction with US 730 to Oregon State Route 207 on the south side of the range. The portion of Bombing Range Road adjacent to the installation is owned by the Navy but is open to the public.
The arid climate, relative isolation, and flat terrain found on the installation make it an excellent location for the kind of training that the Navy uses it for. There are no year-round water bodies on the site. Runoff from rain and snow flows into two seasonal ponds. These were created to support ranching that happened before the military took over.
History.
Seven miles of the Well Springs Segment of the Oregon Trail is located within the boundaries of the installation and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This area is not currently bombed during practice runs, but was a handful of times during World War II. The bomb craters from these tests did not damage the ruts on the trail. The section on the Register is leased to local ranchers for grazing and includes a pioneer cemetery, the remains of a stage station, and a spring. The spring is no longer a reliable source of water due to nearby wells that have been drilled for irrigation. The cemetery is one of the largest known pioneer cemeteries on the trail.
The War Department established the range through a series of land acquisitions between 1941 and 1943 and used it as a testing site for the Army Air Force during World War II. After the war, the range continued to be used by the Air Force until 1960 when it transferred about two-thirds of the land to the Navy, with smaller portions going to the state of Oregon and the Army Corps of Engineers. When the Air Force turned over the land, it was in a checkerboard fashon. Negotiations between the state government and the Navy gave the range the boundaries it has today. The state has leased its portion of the land to Boeing, which uses it for antenna testing, while the Navy has continued to use their portion for weapons testing.
In 2012, a Chinese company named Sany acquired a wind farm adjacent to the range. Later that year, the Obama administration ordered the company to divest the acquisition after it determined that there was "credible evidence" that the company would use this to hurt national security. This order was the first of its kind since 1990.
Air Force.
The War Department established the Arlington Bombing Range by acquiring of land between 1941 and 1943. It was during these early years that the Boardman Airport, then known as the Boardman Flight Strip, was constructed. For the duration of World War II, Walla Walla Army Air Base used it for air-to-ground firing practice. Following the war, the Army marked the land as surplus.
In 1948, the Air Force again began training on the site. From 1952 to 1956, control of the range was granted to the 57th Air Division which was stationed at Fairchild Air Force Base near Spokane, Washington. For the period from 1948 until the Air Force finally ceased use of the range, approximately 20 buildings, a flight strip, gunnery range, and several targets were constructed. The land was marked as excess by the Air Force on August 11, 1960.
Transfer of Ownership.
In November of 1960, the Air Force transferred of the land to the Navy, with going to the Department of Interior and ending up in the hands of the Corps of Engineers. The part apportioned to the Department of Interior ended up in the hands of the state government. The checkerboard fashion of how the Air Force distributed the land didn't work well for use as a bombing range, so the Navy entered negotiations with the state. As a result of the negotiations, the Navy ended up with its current range, located in the eastern half of the original property.
The remainder of the land is split in two portions, the first being jointly owned by the State of Oregon, Portland General Electric and Morrow County. The second portion continues to be owned by the Army Corps of Engineers, whose portion has decreased to slightly less than .
Current Use.
Since negotiations with the other owners completed, the Navy has used the range for weapons testing at high speeds. In 1978, they set aside for the Boardman Research Natural Area, which is a site used to study native grasses and restoration techniques. Further discussion on environmental impacts was initiated in 2000. In 2015, the Navy constructed a new office building to replace aged structures on the property that were being used for that purpose. The new building has offices for and can house six individuals. When active, the airspace comprises restricted areas R-5701 and R-5706.
Boardman Research Natural Area.
The Navy set aside as the Boardman Research Natural Area within the facility. Access to the area for observation and experimentation is administered by the Officer in Charge, and those wishing to gain access must provide a written report of the purpose of their visit prior to gaining entry. The Research Natural Area is part of a nationwide network of protected areas of undisturbed ecosystems. Overnight camping within the area is prohibited, with visitors generally staying in Boardman. It is split into three sections, A, B, and C, which are located approximately in the center of the facility.
Soils in the area were deposited by the Missoula floods during the last ice age. Sand dunes can be found in section C of the natural area and vegetation is classified as sagebrush steppe. Plants found include Russian thistle, snakeweed, and needle-and-thread grass. Several bird species, such as golden eagles, are year-round residents and small mammals like the long-tailed weasel and coyotes live within the ecosystem. It is also a seasonal nesting area for long-billed curlew.
Non-military Activity.
A significant portion of the original range was transferred outside of the military to both government and private entities. The State of Oregon owns the largest portion of the former range, which it leased to The Boeing Company. Boeing had originally intended to turn the area into a space park, but later decided to use the land for farming instead and in 1974 created the Boeing-Agri Industrial Company as a wholly owned subsidiary. A lawsuit was filed against Boeing-Agri Industrial Company in relation to how the company was pulling water out of the Willow Creek arm of the reservoir behind John Day Dam. They also maintain a remote antenna range on the leased property that conducts tests for national security purposes.
Portland General Electric (PGE) owns to operate the Boardman Coal Plant. The plant, which opened in 1975, is one of the largest polluters in Oregon. It constitutes about 15% of PGE's electrical generation, but is scheduled to be shut down in 2020.
Future.
Several proposals are in place for improvements to the facility which would increase its usefulness in training exercises. The Navy and Oregon National Guard want to increase training at the range and introduce new aircraft such as F-35's. They also propose constructing new air-to-ground weapons systems. Construction of a new landing strip and a location to service unmanned aircraft, as well as a second target area, are among the improvements to on-site infrastructure deemed necessary to accomplish these goals.
Beyond its use for air-to-ground training, the military also wants to develop several areas for ground training. These include a machine gun range, digital range, convoy live fire range, and a demolition range. The installation of remote cameras would aid in training by providing visual information to determine the accuracy of weapons tests.
Idaho Power is seeking permission from the Navy to construct of its new power line to tie into a proposed substation that the Bonneville Power Administration plans to build near Boardman. This routing through the range would avoid cutting through farmland.

Singles (cards)

Singles are individual trading or game cards sold by hobby stores, online stores, or by individual collectors. These individual cards are usually of higher value than contemporary cards which are often sold as "bulk" or as a personal collection. Ordinary collectible cards serve little function beyond memorabilia, but CCGs are also used in game tournaments. Generally, collectible card games (CCG) fetch initial higher prices than trading cards because of the dual nature of being both a game and a collectible. Prices will fluctuate for CCGs as cards become legal or illegal to play in certain game formats.
Value.
A single card's value is determined by its scarcity. However, coupled with artificial scarcity and the function of a card in CCGs, prices for a single card can increase. Powerful cards can mean the difference between winning or losing in a tournament. This can also be called the "playability" of a card.
Grading.
Cards are graded according to their physical condition and categories may vary depending on the source. The better the grade, the higher the price of the card.
Collecting.
It is often said that when playing a CCG, the best way to obtain the cards you desire is not via booster packs, but by buying the individual singles you need for your deck. Purchasing booster packs is often seen as a form of gambling, since you don't know what you'll get until after you've paid. Even though the price for an individual card may be more than the price of booster pack, you will likely save money in the long run, as opposed to randomly getting one from a booster pack.
Autographs.
Some singles have been autographed by someone related to the card. The person who autographed the card may be depicted, or their artwork is visible on the card. Cards may also be autographed by the card designer or by a person famous for using that card. The value of an autographed card has been debated, often depending on who has autographed it or the scarcity of the autograph. In some cases, an autograph can be seen as damage to the card, or graffiti.
Counterfeits.
Fake cards are made to imitate real cards and often sold into the card market. In November 1995, Canadian police were notified of counterfeiters in the Windsor, Ontario area. The police seized 40,000 fake cards, including film plates.

Sabiiti Muzeyi

Major General Steven Sabiiti Muzeyi, is a Ugandan military officer and police officer, who served as the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIGP) of the Uganda Police Force, the second-highest rank in that branch of Uganda's government, effective 4 March 2018 to Tuesday 16 December 2020. He replaced Martin Okoth Ochola, who was promoted to Inspector General of Police. Immediately prior to his assignment as Deputy IGP, Sabiiti, at the rank of Brigadier, served as the Commander of the Military Police of the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF). Sabiiti was replaced with Maj Gen Paul Loketch. On Friday 5, Maj Gen Sabiiti Muzeyi was appointed General Manager Luwero Industries, a subsidiary of National Enterprise Corporation( NEC).
Background and education.
He was born in Mbarara District circa 1975. Sabiiti’s father Zekeriah Muzeyi Magyenyi was married to one of Museveni’s maternal aunties. A veteran of Uganda's bush war, Magyenyi died in June 2007. Sabiiti’s mother is Javanis Magyenyi. The young Sabiiti attended Ntare School, then Mbarara High School before he was admitted to Makerere University, Uganda's oldest and largest public university.
At Makerere he studied biochemistry, graduating with a First Class Honors degree of Bachelor of Science. In 1997, he joined the UPDF, signing up in what was then the "Presidential Protection Unit" (PPU). PPU has since been renamed the "Special Forces Command" (SFC). Sabiiti attended boot camp at "Kasenyi Training Wing", in Entebbe. A total of 117 recruits began the basic training course. Twenty five of them dropped out and the new Captain Sabiiti Muzeyi graduated at the top of the remaining 92.
Later, he studied at the Uganda Senior Command and Staff College, in Jinja, in Uganda's Eastern Region. At the rank of Colonel, he won a slot to attend a senior command course at the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, in Kansas. When the United States government blocked his admission, he was instead sent to a military college in Russia.
Career.
Sabiiti was a member of the PPU security forces that provided VIP security during the visit of United States President Bill Clinton to Uganda 1998. He then enrolled into graduate school and lectured part-time on the advice of family members, before returning to the PPU.
He progressively rose in rank, taking on increased responsibility on the way. When PPU was renamed "Presidential Guard Brigade" (PGB), with first-son Muhoozi Kainerugaba at the helm, Sabiiti Muzeyi was selected as his second-in-command. Sabiiti, at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, commanded the unit, when Muhoozi was in South Africa, attending a military course.
When Muhoozi was promoted to Brigadier, Sabiiti was elevated to Colonel. He became Brigadier and Commander of the Uganda Military Police, after his return from the Russian military course. On the evening of Sunday 4 March 2018, he was appointed Deputy Inspector General of Police, to deputize Martin Okoth Ochola.
In February 2019, as part of a promotion exercise involving over 2,000 men and women in the UPDF, he was promoted from Brigadier to Major General.
Family.
Steven Sabiiti Muzeeyi is married to Esther Sabiiti, and together are the parents of two children.

Hoheria lyallii, the mountain lacebark, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family Malvaceae, native to New Zealand, where it grows on drier mountainous areas of South Island - mainly in eastern Canterbury and Marlborough. Growing to , it is a deciduous shrub or small tree with hairy leaves and slightly scented white flowers in summer. The Latin specific epithet "lyallii" honours the Scottish naturalist and explorer David Lyall (1817-1895). In cultivation in the UK this plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit. "Hoheria lyallii" and "Hoheria glabrata" (which has a similar appearance) are known in Māori as houi, and were likely used as textiles by South Island Māori.

Khas Music originates from the practices of the Nepali Khas society.
Castes like Damai, Gandharva, Gaine play musical instruments and sing during festive occasions of the Khas people. Due to modernization this practice has almost disappeared and mass electronic media like television, internet is quickly taking over as means of entertainment especially in the Kathmandu valley.
The term "Khas Music" as a genre is on the decline too as the term "Khas" itself is obsolete. The Khas people have adopted surnames of Chettris and Bahuns.

The Orphan Muses

The Orphan Muses () is a Canadian drama film, directed by Robert Favreau and released in 2000. An adaptation of the play by Michel Marc Bouchard, the film stars Marina Orsini, Céline Bonnier, Stéphane Demers and Fanny Mallette as a group of adult siblings dealing with the revelation of a longtime family secret.
The Tanguay siblings grew up as orphans, after their father died and their mother (Louise Portal) ran off with her new lover. Although older siblings Catherine (Orsini), Martine (Bonnier) and Luc (Demers) knew the truth, they conspired to protect their emotionally fragile youngest sister Isabelle (Mallette) by telling her that their mother was dead as well. The film's plot centres on the fallout within the family of the now adult but still emotionally immature Isabelle finally learning the truth that their mother is still alive and simply abandoned them.
Reception.
The film received four Genie Award nominations at the 21st Genie Awards in 2000: Best Supporting Actress (Bonnier), 
Best Director (Favreau), Best Screenplay (Bouchard and Gilles Desjardins) and Best Editing (Hélène Girard). At the 3rd Jutra Awards in 2001, the film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Actress (Mallette), Best Director (Favreau), Best Sound, Best Editing and Best Original Music. It won the Jutra for Best Original Music.

Readymoney Drinking Fountain

The Readymoney Drinking Fountain, also occasionally known as the Parsee Fountain, is a Grade II listed structure near the middle of the Broad Walk footpath on the east side of Regent's Park, in London. It lies southeast of London Zoo, close to the highest point of Regent's Park, about above sea level, in an area with few trees, making it widely visible across the park.
The drinking fountain was erected in 1869, with the £1,400 cost funded by Sir Cowasji Jehangir Readymoney, a successful Parsee businessman and philanthropist from Bombay, as a token of thanks to the people of England for their protection of the Parsees in British India. 
The structure was built to the Gothic design of Robert Keirle, who was the architect of the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association. It was constructed by the sculptor Henry Ross, using 10 tons of white marble from Sicily, and 4 tons of pink and grey granite from Aberdeen.
The main four-sided structure rests on three octagonal steps. The central white marble block has a pink granite basin on each side, with granite standing blocks on the ground beside each basin. Small apertures were included at the base of the central block to allow dogs to drink. Above each basin is a carved marble panel, with one depicting a lion and another a Brahmin bull, topped by a frieze decorated with inlaid stars and a triangular pediment resembling a gable. The central block rises to a gabled spire with a decorative terminal, with three pink granite columnettes rising to a single pinnacle at each corner. Three of the gables have a carved bust, depicting Readymoney, Prince Albert, and Queen Victoria, and the fourth has a clock.
The drinking fountain was unveiled on 1 August 1869 by Princess Mary of Teck; she was a granddaughter of George III, and her daughter later became Queen Mary.
It was listed at Grade II in 1970, and it was restored in 1999–2000 with over £400,000 of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. A modern plaque above the basin on the south face of the fountain reads:
Further restoration work was undertaken in 2016 and 2017. The water no longer runs, but a modern drinking fountain has been installed nearby.

Transportation in Augusta, Georgia

The City of Augusta, Georgia has an expansive transport network. It consists of two airports, various road bridges, national and local bus service, a highway and street network, freight train service, and boat tours and marinas.
Airports.
Augusta Regional Airport.
Augusta is served by Augusta Regional Airport, formerly known as "Bush Field" (and still referred to as such on highway signs). It is located approximately south of downtown, on Doug Barnard Parkway. It is a relatively small airport, especially when compared to more major airports, such as Atlanta's Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport. It has one concrete and one asphalt runway. It opened in 1941 as a training facility for the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC; the predecessor of the United States Air Force). It became the commercial airport for the city in 1950. In 2000, the facility was renamed "Augusta Regional Airport at Bush Field".
Daniel Field.
Daniel Field is a public use airport. It is located approximately west of downtown, at the intersection of Highland Avenue and Wrightsboro Road. This airport is owned by the City of Augusta. It has two asphalt runways. It was dedicated in late 1927. During World War II, it also served as a training facility of the USAAC, and was known as "Daniel Army Airfield". At the end of 1945, it was returned to civilian use.
Bus service.
National bus service.
Southeastern Stages serves Augusta, via a bus station on Broad Street. There is also an intercity bus station on Fort Gordon. Greyhound Lines also uses this bus station. The public can access the Army base for certain events and services, such as utilizing this station. They have to provide proper identification.
Public transit.
The city has an extensive system of bus service. Augusta Transit operates nine routes throughout the area. These routes are:
Highways and streets.
Augusta has an extensive highway and street network. It consists of two Interstate Highways, four U.S. Highways, ten state highways, and many streets, both major and minor.
Rail service.
The January 2008 draft of the Freight Profile for the Augusta Regional Transportation Study indicates that rail cargo accounts for 7% of all freight in the region by weight (2006 TRANSEARCH). Some of the leading commodities shipped out of Augusta are clay, concrete, glass, and stone products. The leading commodity terminating in the area is lumber and wood products.
At-grade railroad crossings are located on many roads throughout the city. The crossings have been a part of city life for many years. Solutions have been sought to reduce the inevitable conflicts between railroad, motor vehicle, and pedestrian traffic. The availability of rail service is a major attraction for new industry and maintaining existing industry.
Passenger service.
Passenger rail service is currently not available in Augusta. Its last long-distance passenger train was the Southern Railway's "Aiken-Augusta Special," which had its last run in 1966. Other companies serving the city were the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and the Central of Georgia Railway. In 1999, the Georgia Transportation Board approved a long-range plan to provide inter-city passenger rail service between Atlanta and other major cities across the state.
Freight service.
There are two freight providers: Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) and CSX.
Norfolk Southern Railway.
The NS mainline track, known as the R-Line, enters the city from the north, crossing the Savannah River and traveling through downtown on the right-of-way of 6th Street, and is known as the Augusta District. The mainline continues to the southeast toward Savannah. NS has two railroad yards in Augusta: the main classification yard is approximately south of downtown. Its second yard, the Nixon Yard, is south of Augusta Regional Airport near the International Paper plant.
CSX Transportation.
The CSX mainline travels through the city in what is essentially an east–west direction. This line, known partially as the Augusta and McCormick subdivisions, connects Augusta to Spartanburg, South Carolina and Savannah. There is a second CSX line, partially known as the Georgia Subdivision, and was formerly owned by Georgia Railroad and Banking Company, is a connection to Atlanta. CSX has two railroad yards in the city. The main railroad yard is located off of Laney Walker Boulevard southeast of downtown. The yard covers approximately . It consists of an inbound receiving yard and an outbound classification yard. Its second yard, the Harrisonville Yard, is located on between Olive Road and Wrightsboro Road.
Water services.
Augusta Canal tours.
On the Augusta Canal, there are boat tours. These tours are provided using a Petersburg boat, similar to those used on the Savannah River in the 19th century. They show the textile mills, the Confederate Powderworks, and two of Georgia's only remaining 18th century houses.
Marinas.
Augusta has two marinas, the Augusta Riverfront Marina and the Riverwalk Marina, also known as the 5th Street Marina. The Riverfront Marina has the following amenities: access to the riverfront, boat slip rentals, boat ramp, and picnic shelter. The Riverwalk Marina has the following amenities: a gift shop, public boat slip, boat slip rentals, playground, picnic area, and fuel service. Riverfront Marina is located on Riverfront Drive, in the East Augusta portion of the city, east of Olde Town. Riverwalk Marina is off of 5th Street, just before it crosses over the Savannah River.

Ita O'Brien

Ita O’Brien is a British movement director and intimacy co-ordinator for film, TV and theatre. She has taught at some of Britain's leading drama schools, has published research and devises her own work. In 2017, O'Brien introduced the "Intimacy On Set Guidelines", to protect performers during scenes that involve sex or nudity, which gained significant industry and public interest in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandals. She has worked for Amazon, BBC, HBO, and Netflix.
Early life and education.
O'Brien's family is from Clonmel, Ireland. She graduated in 1998 from the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. She also trained as a dancer at the Royal Academy of Dancing. In 2007, she received a master of arts in movement studies from the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama.
Career.
Ita O'Brien pioneered the role of Intimacy Coordinator, which is gaining adoption in leading production houses, including HBO, Netflix, and the BBC. O'Brien has been developing practices when working with intimacy, scenes with sexual content and nudity in film, TV and theatre since 2014. In the absence of any industry-wide guidelines or accepted process, she developed draft guidelines for intimacy, simulated sex scenes and nudity. She is the founder of Intimacy on Set, her company set up in 2018, which provides services to TV, film and theatre when dealing with intimacy, sexual content, and nudity. 
There was brief controversy when, on the BAFTA red carpet in 2018, Andy Serkis likened the idea of guidelines to censorship. However, O'Brien says, "These guidelines are not a constraint, but an improvement on current practice. They free the actor to embody the character whilst delivering repeatable and safe scenes that facilitate the Director's vision."
The guidelines have received the support of Women in Film and Television (UK) and leading industry figures, including Gemma Arterton, Noma Dumezweni, Olivia Colman, Joseph Millson and David Farr.
Her work has received press coverage, particularly for "Normal People", "Sex Education", and "Gentleman Jack". She has been an advocate for the use of an intimacy coordinator in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Ireland, and UK.
In 2021, upon receiving a BAFTA for Best Actress for "I May Destroy You", Michaela Coel dedicated her award to Ita O'Brien, saying "Thank you for your existence in our industry, for making the space safe, for creating physical, emotional and professional boundaries so that we can make work about exploitation, loss of respect, about abuse of power without being exploited or abused in the process". In all, O'Brien worked on six TV productions that were nominated for a BAFTA in 2021.
Film and TV.
Her credits include "Normal People" (2020), "I May Destroy You" (2020), "Sex Education" (2019), "Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams" (2017), "Derren Brown's Ghost Train" (2017,) series 2 of "Humans" (2016), "The Girl With All The Gifts" (2016) and many theatre productions.

<doc id="56770082" url="?curid=56770082" title="Kwee Hing Tjiat">
Kwee Hing Tjiat

Kwee Hing Tjiat (, born Surabaya, 1891, died Semarang, 27 June 1939) was a Chinese-Malay journalist and a leading peranakan Chinese intellectual of the late colonial era.
He spent his childhood in Surabaya, Dutch East Indies and was educated in a Dutch vocational school (Burgersavondschool) and probably also in a Chinese school (Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan). At the age of 21 (in 1913), together with Lie Biauw Kie, Tjia Tjiep Ling, Tan Tjiang Ling, Liem Thoan Tik, and Liem Tjhioe Kwie, he founded the first weekly published in Surabaya named Bok Tok.
In 1914 he became chief editor of Tjhoen Tjhioe's weekly led by Tjoa Jan Hie. In the same year he became chief editor of Palita in Yogyakarta. In 1916 he was invited to the capital Batavia where he was made editor in chief of the daily Sin Po. The first editor of the paper had been a European for legal reasons so Kwee was the first Chinese to hold this position. There he advocated for Chinese nationalism and was critical of the Dutch. During this era he believed that Ethnic Chinese in the Indies should not involve themselves in local politics nor be compelled to serve in the proposed local defense forces which were being discussed at the time (the Indië Weerbaar).
In 1918 he was sent to Europe on behalf of the business firm Hoo Tik Thay in order to help them with tobacco exports, although he continued to write for Sin Po. He traveled in Europe for four years and lived in Berlin for a time. In 1921 he wrote a book titled (Malay: lit. Two Heads of Stone, or Two Stubborn Men), an account of Chinese politics in Java.
He returned to the Dutch East Indies in 1923 but when he arrived at the Port of Tanjung Priok he was refused entry. Then he settled in Shanghai, where he lived for ten years, and wrote for various newspapers in China and Java. Despite his long-standing advocacy of Chinese nationalism, he felt like a foreigner there.
In 1934 he was allowed to return to the Indies under the guarantee of Oei Tiong Hauw of the Oei Tiong Ham Concern. With their support he founded a new Chinese-Malay newspaper called (Malay: The Sun). His early staff were Liem Koen Hian, Mr. Ko Kwat Tiong, Kwee Tek Hoaij, Kwee Thiam Tjing, Njonja Tjoa Hin Hoei, Njonja Lim Sam Tjiang and Miss Thung Tien.
Based on his experience living in Europe and China, his political views shifted and he realized that peranakan Chinese were more culturally Indonesian than Chinese. For example, he met the Chinese ambassador in Vienna and was embarrassed by his inability to express himself in the language. In the 1930s, under the influence of Indonesian nationalists, he advanced the idea that Indies Chinese were also (Malay: sons of Indonesia).
Kwee Hing Tjiat died at 19:40, 27 June 1939 (at the age of 47) in Semarang.

Scelioninae

Scelioninae is a subfamily of wasps in the family Platygastridae. It is a very large cosmopolitan group (over 3000 described species in some 160 genera) of exclusively parasitoid wasps, mostly small (0.5–10 mm), often black, often highly sculptured, usually with geniculate (elbowed) antennae that have a 9- or 10-segmented flagellum. It was formerly considered to be a family Scelionidae but has been reclassified as a subfamily of the Platygastridae.
The subfamilies Scelioninae, Teleasinae, and Telenominae were formerly in the family Scelionidae, but Scelionidae was combined with the family Platygastridae because of genetic similarities. The name Platygastridae was retained for the resulting family because of seniority.
Biology.
They are generally idiobionts, attacking the eggs of many different types of insects, spiders, butterflies (the hackberry emperor, for example) and many are important in biological control. Several genera are wingless, and a few attack aquatic insect eggs underwater.

Lombardisch-Venetianische und Central-Italienische Eisenbahn

The LVCI company (full title "Imperial-regia società privilegiata delle strade ferrate lombardo-venete e dell'Italia Centrale" was a private railway company that, from 1856 to 1859, had the concession for the construction and operation of the railway network in the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia and central Italy.
History.
The convention.
The company was born as a result of a convention signed in Vienna on 14 March 1856 "concerning the assumption, construction and operation of the railways in the Lombard-Veneto Kingdom" and of the international treaty of the following 17 March which transferred the concession already given in 1851 to the Società Anonima per la Strada Ferrata dell'Italia Centrale. Article 43 of the Vienna Convention granted "signatory gentlemen" to establish a company with residence in Vienna and to issue, after the approval of the company's bylaws, individual or bearer shares whose nominal value was not less than 600 Austrian lire. The company thus constituted therefore took over all the rights and obligations of the "concessionaire gentlemen". The convention had "the purpose of fulfilling, in the interest of commerce, as soon as possible the network of railway tracks of the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia and to simplify possibly the exercise and administration of the railways belonging to the Imperial Royal Treasury and forming part of the same network". It was essentially the sale of the network already built in Lombardy-Venetia and the concessions granted. The concession for the railway track of central Italy and its branches was then added.
Finance.
The convention saw, as actors on one side, the imperial-ministers of finance and trade and on the other: 
The president of the Austrian Credit Association for Trade and Industry, Prince Giovanni Adolfo of Schwarzenberg, the vice-presidents, Count Francesco Zichy and Baron A. S. di Rothschild of the Rothschild banking house.
The Duke of Galliera, Raffaele de Ferrari in Bologna, the Duke Lodovico Melzi in Milan, Count Giuseppe Archinto in Milan represented by Messrs. Mondolfo and Broth, Pietro Bastogi in Livorno.
The Rothschild brothers of Paris, represented by the Rothschild banking house in Vienna, E. Blount and Compagni, Paulin Talabot in Paris.
Rothschild and sons of London, represented by the Rothschild banking house in Vienna, Samuel Laing and Matteo Uzielli of London.
The concession.
The Austrian government ceded the Lombardy-Venetia (Lombardisch-Venetianische Staatsbahn) railway network, except the railway from Verona to South Tyrol, to the consortium of banks (often referred to as the company of Lombard-Veneto railways) for a global sum of 100 million Austrian lire in exchange for the concession granted for 90 years starting from 1 January 1856.
"Società anonima delle strade ferrate lombardo-venete e dell'Italia centrale" was the name, in Italian, with which the Imperial-Royal company (concessionaire of the railway network of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia and Central Italy) was indicated in its entry to the Stock Exchange of Milan from 1 July 1858. The inscription was also the first of a joint-stock company in the said stock exchange which, until now, had only dealt with government bonds. However, the company was already listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange since its establishment at the end of 1856.
War.
Proceedings were delayed by the Second Italian War of Independence of 1859 following which the territory was divided by moving the border of Lombardy-Venetia to the Mincio and part of the network was incorporated into the Sudbahn. The company was in possession of the agreements signed with the Austrian Government on 14 March 1856, 8 April 1857 and 23 September 1858 and with the Austrian, Parma, Modena, Tuscany and Papal Governments on 17 March 1856. These were reconfirmed, with due variations in the agreement, and signed by the representatives of the Government of the Kingdom of Italy on June 25, 1860. The convention confirmed largely the previous ones but with some variations, including the revocation of the construction of the section up to Borgoforte.
Final approval.
On 8 July 1860 the Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy approved the Convention of 25 June with which the concessions of railways in the territory granted to the Company were recognized and confirmed (with the modifications specified in the same agreement and in the annexed documents agreements with the Austrian Government, on March 14, 1856, April 8, 1857 and September 23, 1858 and the convention of March 17, 1856 with the Austrian, Parma, Modenese, Tuscan and Papal governments). Following the changes, the Società anonima delle strade ferrate della Lombardia e dell'Italia Centrale was subsequently established.

Platypelta

Platypelta is an extinct genus of herbivorous ankylosaurid dinosaurs within the subfamily Ankylosaurinae. It is known from the Late Cretaceous Dinosaur Park Formation (early Late Campanian stage, about 77.5-76.5 Ma ago) of southern Alberta, Canada. The type species is "Platypelta coombsi".
Discovery and naming.
In 1914, Barnum Brown and Peter Kaisen, working for the American Museum of Natural History, in Alberta at the Sand Creek near the Red Deer River, eight miles southeast of Steveville, excavated an ankylosaur skeleton, specimen AMNH 5337. In 1971, it was referred to "Euoplocephalus tutus" by Walter Preston Coombs. In 2001 however, Paul Penkalski concluded that this skeleton was nearly identical to another exemplar, AMNH 5403, and that both likely represented a separate taxon. In 2013, Victoria Megan Arbour en Philip Currie continued referring it to "Euoplocephalus" as AMNH 5337 differed from "Scolosaurus" and "Dyoplosaurus" in the pelvic region.
In 2018, Penkalski published a study containing a cladistic analyses of such forms. In it, AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5403 were recovered in a joint different position from "Euoplocephalus tutus" specimens CMN 210, UALVP 31, and AMNH 5406. He named a separate genus for AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5403: "Platypelta", with as type species "Platypelta coombsi". The generic name is derived from Greek "platys", "wide", and "plate", "small shield", in reference to the broad osteoderms. The specific name honors Walter P. Coombs Jr., who pioneered the study of ankylosaurs in the late twentieth century.
The holotype, AMNH 5337, was found in a layer of the Dinosaur Park Formation at an altitude of 667 metres, which indicates an age of about 76,8 million years. It consists of a skeleton with skull, lacking the tail and hindlimbs. It represents a mature and aged individual, in view of fused ribs, a fused shoulder girdle, rough articulation surfaces and rough armour.
Specimens AMNH 5403, CMN 8876, ROM 788, and ROM 813 were referred to "Platypelta". AMNH 5403 consists of the severely compressed front half of a skeleton including the skull. A short tail club has been stored with this skeleton, but Penkalski doubted the connection, pointing out that the club was not marked nor mentioned in the accession catalogue. CMN 8876 is a skull preserving a single tooth. ROM 788 is a tail club. ROM 813 is a skeleton lacking the skull but containing the entire rump, forelimbs and hindlimbs. Apart from a large number of osteoderms, it preserves skin impressions. It has been secured on three blocks that have not been fully prepared to conserve the impressions. Penkalski already in 2001 suggested it represented a taxon different from "Euoplocephalus".
Description.
"Platypelta" is a rather large ankylosaurid. In 2018, its length was estimated at six metres.
According to Penkalski, "Platypelta" is typified by a number of traits. Some of the armour plates on its rump are large, exceeding twenty-five centimetres in length, and have a rough top surface with a sharp keel continuing into a pointy beak-shape. The snout is constricted just in front of the eye sockets. The upper beak, of the snout, is rounded and relatively small. The vomers at their front side overlap the rear underside of the fused premaxillae. At the rear of the skull, the occipital condyle is large. The squamosal horns, at the rear corners of the skull roof, are low and rough with a broad base and a pitted point extending to behind. The tooth crowns are strongly ornamented. In the lower arm, the ulna is long and lightly built. In the pelvis, the front blade of the ilium only lightly bends to below. The foot is robust with arched claws. On the first cervical halfring, the transverse armour band protecting the top front of the neck, the paired middle osteoderms are elongated and partly keeled with a conical projection. On the first cervical halfring, the lateral, or side, osteoderms have a bent but not wavy keel of which the point sticks out to the rear.
Phylogeny.
"Platypelta" was in 2018 placed, within the Ankylosauridae, in the Ankylosaurinae. More precisely it was a member of the clade Euoplocephalini. In the evolutionary tree it was placed above "Scolosaurus" and below "Dyoplosaurus".

The election was won by the centrist Christian Democracy, as it happened at national level. Seven Lombard provinces gave a majority or at least a plurality to the winning party, while the agricultural Province of Pavia and Province of Mantua preferred the Italian Communist Party.
Background.
This election was quite a copy of the previous one. The Italian Liberal Party was the sole loser, to its left to the Italian Republican Party and to its right to the Italian Social Movement.
Electoral system.
The electoral system for the Senate was a strange hybrid which established a form of proportional representation into FPTP-like constituencies. A candidate needed a landslide victory of more than 65% of votes to obtain a direct mandate. All constituencies where this result was not reached entered into an at-large calculation based upon the D'Hondt method to distribute the seats between the parties, and candidates with the best percentages of suffrages inside their party list were elected.

Ma Zhu

Ma Zhu (馬注) (1640 – after 1710) was a Chinese Hanafi-Maturidi scholar. Ma was noted for his combining of Confucian and Islamic values in his philosophy.
Biography.
Ma was born in Yongchang Fu in Yunnan Province during the reign of the Qing dynasty. His father died when Ma was young. He is claimed to be a descendant of Ajall Shams al-Din Omar, a Muslim Mongol general, and of the Prophet Mohammed.
Philosophy.
Ma Zhu's philosophy focused heavily on social relations and interactions between the sexes. He theorized that, per Confucian and Islamic values, an ideal society would be one in which men dominated public affairs while women would serve in a subservient role as domestic helpmates. The philosopher opposed women performing roles outside of the home, stating "Even a talented woman should not take care of non-domestic affairs." Ma took inspiration for his ideal role for women from the story of Adam and Eve, in which Allah created Eve from the flesh of Adam. This indicated to Ma that men and women were not intended to be of equal standing in society. In his work "Qingzhen Zhinan" (清真指南), Ma noted,
Ma's philosophy also denoted the distinctions between the traditional Chinese paired forces of Ming and Xing, Yin and yang. According to Ma, Ming represented what was preordained by Allah, while Xing represented by what was acquirable though social conditioning and exposure to earthly human existence. Similarly, in Ma's view yin represented the earthly acquired and yang represented the divinely innate. Parts from both were required to form any human, but men and women differed in terms of how much of each respective force they embodied. In "Qingzhen Zhinan", Ma posited that men were composed primarily of yang while women favoured yin. Thus, Zhu concluded that men's dispositions favoured sacredness and nobility in contrast to the worldly and "debased" dispositions of women. Ma also noted that their reliance on yin granted females a propensity towards greed, hesitation, impropriety, and contemptuousness towards the poor. However, Ma also believed that women should strive to be similar to famous women in Islam in order to overcome their evil proclivities. Ma mentioned Moleyan, Khadiyah, and Fatima as examples of women who had overcome the immoral tendencies of their sex and become closer to Allah.
In addition to his views on gender, Ma also advocated for both men and women to pursue an Islamic education.

Quezon Eco-Tourism Road

The Quezon Eco-Tourism Road is a , two-to-eight lane scenic road in the province of Quezon, Philippines.
The entire road is a component of the National Route 422 (N422) of the Philippine highway network. Previously, the road was originally unnumbered as a barangay road at the time of completion.
Route description.
After experiencing delays due to right-of-way issues, it finally opened to traffic in March 2016, the road bypasses within the town propers of Candelaria and Sariaya. It starts from Rosario–San Juan–Candelaria Road in the west and ends at the Lucena Diversion Road (Maharlika Highway) in Lucena. Travelers from Batangas shortens the travel time as an alternate route to the Bicol Region. Along the roadway, it is a scenic road—where it passes the agricultural land and plantations in the Quezon province.
The road is currently being extended to the north towards Tayabas, with a future connection to San Antonio via the Quezon Eco-Tourism-Sariaya-Candelaria-Tiaong-San Antonio Road.

Haredi news hotline

A Haredi news hotline is a telephone service that serves as an important source of news in the Haredi world. Many Haredim do not listen to the radio or have access to the internet, leaving them with little or no access to breaking news. News hotlines were formed to fill this gap, and many have expanded to additional fields over time. Currently, many news lines provide rabbinic lectures, entertainment, business advice and similar services, in addition to their primary function of reporting the news. Many hasidic sects maintain their own hotlines, where relevant internal news is reported and the group's perspective can be advocated for. In the Israeli Haredi community, there are dozens of prominent hotlines, in both Yiddish and Hebrew. Some Haredi hotlines have played significant public roles, however many prominent services have faced struggles.
Kol Mevaser.
Kol Mevaser is a Yiddish news hotline. It reports the news, weather, lottery, traffic, and carries interviews and scholarly lectures on various topics of interest to the Yiddish-speaking Orthodox Jewish community.
Frum News Wire.
Frum News Wire, or FNW, was a news hotline based in Lakewood Township, New Jersey, a subsidiary of the "Voice of Lakewood" magazine. FNW carried local and world news, audio recordings of notable events, and various forms of entertainment. They have had interviews with notable Haredi personalities, such as Jake Turx, Yossi Gestetner, and Richard Roberts.. One of its popular shows was "The Yaakov M. Show", a political podcast.
According to FNW, most callers called more than once a day, and the hotline had an average total of fifteen thousand calls a day. It said that the majority of its listeners were from the tri-state area, with approximately half from Lakewood.
During its final months, FNW stopped updating their news and music sections, only updating "The Yaakov M. Show". After they shut down, "The Yaakov M. Show" opened up its own hotline, the Jewish News Channel, before moving to Yeshiva International.
Yeshiva International Newsline.
Yeshiva International Newsline, often referred to as YIN, is a Haredi news hotline, based in Lakewood Township, New Jersey.
History.
YIN was started in 2012 on a restricted access network which required a password, and was advertised by word of mouth. Often broadcasting news that was unavailable in the mainstream English language haredi media, it successfully carved out a niche for itself within the Haredi yeshiva community. In its early period, the hotline issued extensive coverage of the plans and efforts underway in Israel to initiate a compulsory draft of Haredi yeshiva students. The hotline espoused a Satmar-like position on the matter, and strongly praised Rabbi Shmuel Auerbach and his no-compromise policy regarding the draft law.
Current format.
YIN eventually switched to an open access system and started carrying advertisements. As the hotline grew more popular, YIN gradually shifted from its intense focus on Israeli Haredi news to more general coverage, although it continues to report Israeli news. Together with news reports, the hotline features a music section, rabbinic lectures, documentaries (deemed appropriate for the hareidi audience), and various seasonal sections, usually before major Jewish holidays.
Voicenews.
Voicenews, a haredi news hotline, advertises on their Twitter account with the slogan: "No Smartphone. Listen to updated news by dialing..." Voicenews, operating entirely with an automated voice, includes news, read from articles by larger news companies, including Associated Press, Washington Examiner, Israel National News, and Hamodia; a music section; audio recordings of notable speeches by politicians and other governmental figures; the weather and "zmanim"; and deals.

The Opening Round

The Opening Round, subtitled "The Groove Masters Series Vol. 1" is an album by saxophonist Houston Person which was recorded in 1997 and released on the Savant label.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Stewart Mason states "A fun and personable mix of jazz and soul classics plus a couple of originals by guitarist Rodney Jones, Houston Person's "The Opening Round: Groove Masters Series, Vol. 1" isn't a jazz album for the ages, but it's start-to-finish entertaining. It's a straight-up groove album, with Person in front of a four-piece organ combo". In JazzTimes, Stanley Dance wrote: "Person’s thick, unmannered tone, love of melody and swing, together give his music an odd sobriety that he seems compelled to relieve with fast flurries of notes".

Exocarpos humifusus

Exocarpos humifusus, also known as mountain native-cherry, is a small shrub member of the family Santalaceae, all of which are hemiparasites. "Exocarpos humifusus" is a dwarfish and sprawling shrub with woody stems, and small dry fruits that grow atop a fleshy red stalk, hence the common name of native-cherry.
Description.
"Exocarpos humifusus" is a rigid, woody dwarf shrub with branches prostrate and spreading over the ground and rocks. The stems are dark yellow-green tinged with red, and are ribbed with rounded edges. The leaves are triangular and scale shaped, about long, arranged alternately along the stem. The flowers are generally 4 parted, approximately in diameter and grow in bunches of 2-3 on a short stalk at the end of a stem. The fruit is a small greenish-black drupe or nut in length, that grows atop a fleshy receptacle. When mature the receptacle of the fruit is dark red fleshy, juicy and edible, attracting animals as distributors.
Habitat and distribution.
"Exocarpos humifusus" is endemic to Tasmania. It grows abundantly above and on lower elevation mountains in the south-west, in sub-alpine and alpine areas. It is found growing over the surfaces of rocks on mountain plateaus and summits throughout Tasmania. It is widespread among the plant communities of alpine heath and fjaeldmark.

G&amp;SWR 279 Class

The Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&amp;SWR) 279 Class was a class of 0-6-0 steam locomotive designed by Peter Drummond, of which 15 were built in 1913 by the North British Locomotive Company at its Queens Park works. Originally built as the 279 class, as a result of renumbering they became known as the 71 Class in 1919, before passing to the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) on its formation in 1923, where they were given power classification 4F.
History.
Until the retirement of James Manson from the post of locomotive superintendent at the end of 1911, the development of Glasgow and South Western Railway locomotives had been a matter of gradual evolution. Successive locomotive superintendents had learned their trade at the company's Kilmarnock Locomotive Works before reaching the top job. Most of the locomotives were efficient and reliable machines, but by 1911 many were elderly and even the newer locomotives were somewhat small by contemporary standards. The appointment of Peter Drummond to replace Manson marked a departure from previous practice, as Drummond was an 'outsider' to the G&amp;SWR with little affinity for the established Kilmarnock design principles and a preference for larger locomotives.
The 279 Class 0-6-0s were Drummond's first design for the G&amp;SWR, and in keeping with his 'big engine' policy they were the heaviest 0-6-0s in Britain at the time of construction (their weight only being exceeded by the later LNER J38 and J39 classes). Despite their size they were not equipped with superheating as Peter Drummond (like his brother Dugald on the London and South Western Railway) instead preferred to use smokebox 'steam driers'. The locomotives had very little in common with previous G&amp;SWR designs, even to the extent that they were driven from the left side of the cab - a change which was inevitably unpopular with enginemen who were used to driving from the right.
The new locomotives were delivered to Corkerhill and Currock locomotive sheds for use on goods traffic between Glasgow and Carlisle, but problems soon became apparent. Whilst they steamed well and were capable of hauling the 50 wagon trains they were designed for, the locomotives were extremely slow on the uphill sections of the line, had high coal and lubricating oil consumption, and were prone to overheating bearings. The marine pattern big ends were particularly prone to failure. Their performance and reliability was so poor that the company agreed to pay drivers and firemen a bonus of sixpence per single trip with a 279, provided they managed to complete at least three-quarters of the distance between Glasgow and Carlisle without it suffering a failure. 
For the G&amp;SWR's next batch of goods engines Drummond designed the 403 class, which was a superheated development of the 279 class with a leading pony truck. Eventually various modifications were carried out to improve the 279 class, including removal of the steam driers and the fitting of new cottered big ends. Reliability was greatly improved, but the very slow climbing speed was unchanged. 
Under LMS ownership the Carlisle-based locomotives were transferred from Currock to the former Caledonian Railway shed at Carlisle Kingmoor, and they began to be used on a wider range of routes. From 1925 the availability of former Caledonian and new LMS Fowler Class 4F 0-6-0s enabled the class to be cascaded to less demanding duties and some engines were transferred to Ayr and Ardrossan sheds. As a class of only 15 locomotives they inevitably fell foul of the LMS standardisation policy, so they were withdrawn and scrapped in 1930-1933 when their boilers became due for replacement.
Accidents and Incidents.
On 2 July 1928 locomotive 17759 was working a freight train from Stranraer to Glasgow which derailed whilst passing over a 15mph curve at Pinwherry at around 50mph, killing the driver and fireman. The reason for the excessive speed could not be conclusively established, but the driver had only recently been promoted to work over the Stranraer line and the accident inspector speculated that he may have forgotten about the tight curve at Pinwherry. If so, the driver may have intentionally built up speed on the downhill run from Chirmorlie to Pinwherry in order to make a good run up the ensuing climb to Pinmore.

Oost-Azië

Oost-Azië (Dutch for "East Asia") is a volume of poetry by Dutch poet J. Slauerhoff. First published in 1928 under the pseudonym John Ravenswood, the collection contains poems whose theme is the Far East, a part of the globe Slauerhoff knew from his career as a sailor.
Contents.
"Oost-Azië" contains four sections. The first and the third are collections of various poems; the second and the third are themed sections, dedicated to Macao and Korea respectively.
The first section opens with an editorial comment, in which "J. Slauerhoff" explains that he is publishing these verses on behalf of the recently deceased "John Ravenswood", a Dutchman of Scottish descent, who had withdrawn from Western life to Jeju Island (then called "Quelpart" by Europeans) where he married a local woman after deserting the whaling ship on which he sailed.
Macau occupies an important place in Slauerhoff's work; it is the setting of his 1931 novel "Het verboden rijk", in which Camões was one of the two protagonists. "Oost-Azië"s "Macao" section is dedicated to Constâncio José da Silva, an important Macanese newspaper editor. Two of the "Macao" poems, and a poem about a Portuguese fort in Asia, were translated into French for "Fleurs de Marécage".
Critical reception.
Nico Donkersloot, in a comparison between "Oost-Azië" and "Eldorado", which Slauerhoff published under his own name in the same year, called the former less grand than the latter, but with a more exciting "plasticity" in its poetry. Donkersloot describes the poems as finely-drawn sketches with exquisite lines that avoid the simplicity of easy rhymes and instead feature unexpected and curious "magnetic" rhymes, an effect achieved by rhyming polysyllabically. He compares the poems to Japanese prints, detailed and sharp and sometimes rivaling the work of Herman Gorter.
Hendrik Marsman noted that "Oost-Azië" appeared at roughly the same time as "Eldorado", and that some of the poems would have fit better, perhaps, in that collection. Marsman singles out "Captain Miguel", a 44-line biography (dedicated to "J. Slauerhoff"!) of a former sailor who withdraws from life and settles for a mundane and repetitive existence aboard a coaster that goes up and down the coast of China. The poem's description of the "rough tramp's life of a desperado" is typical of Slauerhoff, and according to Marsman it is treated here more eloquently, in less "barbarous" verse, than in "Eldorado", and unlike some of those poems is more easily "inhabited" by the reader. "Oost-Azië" focuses on landscapes, bays, objects, whereas "Eldorado" portrays people, and in a much more direct manner, in more or less autobiographical poems. On the whole, Marsman thought the collection decent though never of superior quality, and falling short of Slauerhoff's poetic talent.

Edwards River (North Canterbury)

The Edwards River is a river located in the north of New Zealand's Canterbury region. It is the northern of the two rivers in New Zealand of this name.
A tributary of the Waiau River, it skirts the northern slopes of the Hanmer Range, flowing south then west for 15 km before joining the Waiau.
The river rises on the southern slopes of the Saint James Range, close to Mount Horrible and Mount Sadd. It initially flows south through a steep sided valley before turning westwards. In its middle reaches, the river's valley is broad and wide, with the river becoming a braided river with shingle banks. At its western end, it passes through a steep-sided gorge close to its junction with the Waiau.

In a Sentimental Mood (Houston Person album)

In a Sentimental Mood is an album by saxophonist Houston Person that was recorded in 2000 and released on the HighNote label.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Stewart Mason states: "Houston Person is an excellent, underrated tenor saxophonist with a full, rich tone and a knack for well-constructed, tasteful, but never boring solos. That said, he's occasionally guilty of giving the people what they want, releasing smooth and conservative albums that are perfectly enjoyable to listen to, but somewhat beneath what he's capable of. 2000's "In a Sentimental Mood" is exactly that; this collection of standards features some excellent performances of classic ballads, but it's all so polite that it's hard to see the set as anything more than better-than-average background music. ... there are so few risks taken on "In a Sentimental Mood" that one doesn't even have to listen to the album; anyone who knows these songs and Houston Person's characteristic sound already knows what this album sounds like. It sounds terrific, but it's hard not to want more."

Billy Walters (gambler)

William T. Walters (born July 15, 1946) is an American entrepreneur, philanthropist, and retired professional gambler widely regarded as among the most successful sports bettors in Las Vegas, having a winning streak which extended for over 30 years.
In 1987, Walters stopped all gambling other than sports betting and returned to his roots in business. As of 2016, his holding company owned interests in eight car dealerships with one under construction, one golf course on the Las Vegas Strip, a rental-car franchise, and a number of commercial properties. In 2014, his net worth was estimated at more than $100 million.
Early life.
Walters grew up poor in the rural town of Munfordville, Kentucky. His father, an auto mechanic, died when Walters was 18 months old. His mother, who was an alcoholic, walked out on her son and two daughters shortly after his father's death. He was raised by his grandmother in a home with no running water or indoor plumbing.
Walters credits his grandmother, a devout Baptist, with instilling a strong work ethic. She worked two jobs cleaning houses and washing dishes while raising seven children. At the age of seven, Walters secured a $40 bank loan for a power lawnmower to start a grass-cutting business. At age nine, he secured a second loan for $90 to start a paper route. His grandmother arranged both loans for Walters.
His grandmother died when Walters was 13, forcing him to move to Louisville, KY, to be with his mother. There he worked two jobs, one in the morning at a bakery and the second at a gas station in the evenings. He rented a room in the basement from his mother. He married and had a child before graduating high school. The marriage was short-lived.
Business success.
In 1965, Walters went to work as a salesman at McMackin Auto Sales, a used-car lot in Louisville. Each time he sold a car, he mailed a self-promotion letter to 10 people living on each side of that customer's home. He would peruse the daily newspaper for car ads, inviting the ads' sellers to do trades with him. He went through the phone book and cold-called people. Walters sold an average of 32 cars a month and earned $56,000 a year in 1966, equal to about $400,000 today.
Walters worked 80 hours a week selling cars and setting dealership records. In 1967, he was hired as sales manager at Steven's Brothers Auto Sales, a competing dealership. He worked at Stevens Brothers until 1972, when he started his own business, Taylor Boulevard Auto Sales, wholesaling cars to other dealers throughout the southeastern United States.
During that time, Walters also remained involved in sports betting. In 1981, he left the automobile industry to become a full-time sports bettor. He was running his own betting service on the side and, in 1982, pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of possession of gambling records in Kentucky. The charge later was expunged from his record.
It was then that he decided to move with his wife, Susan, to Las Vegas, where opportunity beckoned and betting on sports was legal. 
Gambling career.
Walters started gambling when he was 9 years old, when he bet the money he earned from his paper route on the New York Yankees to beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1955 World Series. The Dodgers won and Walters lost the bet, but it did not deter him from gambling. Walters was a losing gambler as late as 1982. He had lost $50,000 by the time he was 22. Walters once lost his house during a game of pitching nickels. The winner did not take possession; Walters agreed to pay off the debt over the next 18 months.
Walters' success changed in his mid to late 30s. In June 1986, Walters requested a freeze-out with Caesars Atlantic City for $2 million at the roulette tables. Walters was known to have lost $1 million at least twice at the Las Vegas blackjack tables. Caesars, however, declined his request. Walters then took his proposition to the Atlantic Club Casino Hotel, then known as the Golden Nugget, which was accepted.
Walters and his gambling partner delivered $2 million to the cage at the Atlantic Club Casino Hotel. The pair noticed a wheel bias and bet on the 7-10-20-27-36. After 38 hours of play they won $3,800,000, beating the prior record of $1,280,000 held by Richard W. Jarecki at the San Remo Casino in Monte Carlo in 1971. Three years later his "Syndicate" had won $400,000 at a casino in Las Vegas and an additional $610,000 from Claridge Casino in Atlantic City. Walters also captured the 1986 Super Bowl of Poker, (also known as Amarillo Slim's Super Bowl of Poker or SBOP) in Lake Tahoe earning $175,000.
Sports betting.
In the 1980s, Walters joined the Computer Group, which used computer analysis to analyze sports outcomes. Over a period of 39 years, Walters had only one losing year, with a 30-year winning streak. Though he has finished in the red for a few months, he was always in the black by the end of the year. Walters bet on basketball, NFL, and college football. Walters won $3.5 million on Super Bowl XLIV after betting on the New Orleans Saints. Due to his reputation, Walters often placed bets through "runners" so bookmakers would remain unaware of the person behind the bet.
In January 2007, Walters won a $2.2 million bet on University of Southern California defeating University of Michigan; USC won, 32-18. In 2011, Walters claimed he could make between $50 to $60 million on a good year.
Insider trading.
In April 2017, Walters was found guilty of insider trading after using non-public information from Thomas C. Davis, a board member of Dean Foods. Walters was sentenced to 5 years in prison and fined $10 million. Lawyer Daniel Goldman, then an assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, was part of the trial team.
Walters' source, company director Thomas C. Davis, using a prepaid cell phone and sometimes the code words "Dallas Cowboys" for Dean Foods, helped Walters, between 2008 and 2014, realize profits and avoid losses in the stock, the Federal jury found. Walters gained $32 million in profits and avoided $11 million in losses. At the trial, investor Carl C. Icahn was mentioned in relation to Walters’ trading but was not charged with wrongdoing. Golfer Phil Mickelson "was also mentioned during the trial as someone who had traded in Dean Foods shares and once owed nearly $2 million in gambling debts to" Walters. Mickelson "made roughly $1 million trading Dean Foods shares; he agreed to forfeit those profits in a related civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission".
On December 4, 2018, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the insider trading conviction and 5 year sentence of Walters, even though it chastised an FBI agent for leaking grand jury information about the case. On October 7, 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Walters’ appeal.
Walters was initially imprisoned at Federal Prison Camp, Pensacola, but was released to home confinement in Carlsbad, California, on May, 1, 2020, amid the coronavirus pandemic. His sentence was scheduled to be completed on January 10, 2022, and was commuted by Donald Trump on January 20, 2021.
Personal life.
Walters has three children, and was an avid golfer. He claims to have made over $400,000 on one hole and once as much as $1 million in one round, although he admitted to losing a million at blackjack later that night. 
In June 2014, Walters had a private jet worth $20 million and owned seven homes, with a net worth estimated at over $100 million.
Walters is a noted philanthropist and has donated to Opportunity Village, a Las Vegas nonprofit for people with intellectual disabilities. In September 2020, in response to Opportunity Village canceling their two largest fundraising events because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Walters family committed to a $1 million matching donation. He and his wife Susan have been staunch Opportunity Village advocates for decades and were honored at the organization’s 11th annual black-tie gala Camelot in 2012. 
The couple were also honored as Las Vegas Philanthropists of the Year in 1997 by the Association of Fundraising Professionals Las Vegas Chapter
Billy Walters and his wife Susan say they will donate $1 million to the effort to rebrand the Las Vegas airport.

Controversy.
In 2012, the families of some residents at Munzer House accused Jewish Care of substandard care at the facility. The families claimed that the situation was cause by staff and budget cuts. Examples of substandard care included rationing of sanitary pads, failure to look after the religious needs of the residents, and forcing residents to wait to go to the toilet for up to an hour. 
The claims of neglect and Elder abuse, soon extended to other care facilities run by Jewish Care, including banning family members and serious neglect of the elderly residents. Some of the families contacted the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission regarding the care at the facilities.
In 2013, Jewish Care began an inquiry that dealt with extensive Child sexual abuse that happened at a children's home between 1939 and 1992, when it closed.
In 2015, the General Manager of Cultural &amp; Spiritual Services, Meir Shlomo Kluwgant, was forced to resign following an abusive text message that he sent calling the father of a victim of Sexual abuse a "lunatic".
In 2016, Jewish Care opened a confidential phone line to assist the Yeshivah Centre, Melbourne in their redress scheme for the victims of sexual abuse by the centre. The name of at least one of the victims was leaked by a board member of Jewish Care to the board of the Yeshiva Centre. This act allegedly led to the bullying and intimidation of the victim.

Colton Underwood drama.
In January 2018, before being cast for "The Bachelorette", Underwood had a brief relationship with "The Bachelor" season 22 contestant Tia Booth. Kufrin was made aware of the relationship early in the season but after Underwood received a hometown date, Booth came back and told Kufrin that she still had feelings. Underwood was then eliminated.
During Underwood's hometown date, he revealed to Kufrin that she was the first girl he has brought home to meet his family. This was later proven to be untrue as fans of the show found old pictures of Underwood's ex-girlfriend, Aly Raisman, at his home with his family.
After Underwood disclosed to Kufrin that he is a virgin, Wendy Williams commented on her show that she "[doesn't] trust people that have never had a drink, a smoke, and [she doesn't] trust people that have never had sex". Williams received criticism from some fans, saying she humiliated Underwood and that virgin-shaming was not okay. Underwood responded to Williams on Twitter by stating "Don’t trust a virgin, but you’ll trust your 3 baby daddies who cheat on you every weekend. Okay". The tweet was ill-received by some fans of "The Bachelorette", believing it had racist and slut-shaming undertones.

Dialogues (Houston Person and Ron Carter album)

Dialogues is an album by saxophonist Houston Person and bassist Ron Carter recorded in 2000 and released on the HighNote label in 2002.
Reception.
The AllMusic review by Scott Yanow said "In 2000, Person and Carter recorded their third duet album, and the results are at least as rewarding as their first two collaborations. ... Person and Carter swing hard and sound at their most playful and creative in each other's company. They both sound inspired by this setting (where every sound counts) and play with full confidence; there is not a single hesitant moment. This is a particularly memorable and enjoyable effort that features the two musicians at their best". In JazzTimes, Doug Ramsey stated "Tenor saxophonist Houston Person and bassist Ron Carter are alone together in their tonal roundness and relaxed exposition of rhythm and melody ... Carter solos on every piece, now and then breaking out double stops and other tricks of the bassist’s trade. On “Mack the Knife,” he and Person trade phrases to great effect. But it is when he is playing perfect complementary notes and laying the time down behind Person that Carter is at his best".

Sports Afield Trophy Properties

Sports Afield Trophy Properties, formerly Cabela's Trophy Properties, LLC. is an independent real estate listing subsidiary of Sports Afield, an outdoors magazine. It was founded as Cabela's Trophy Properties, LLC by Cabela's, American specialty retailer of outdoor merchandise. Cabela's sold the service to Sports Afield in 2014.
History.
Launched in February 2004, Cabela's Trophy Properties “grew out of Cabela's CEO Dennis Highby's own frustration a few years before when he was looking for recreational property to buy and couldn't find any national listing service for such property.” Cabela's Trophy Properties did not directly engage in real estate transactions, instead operating as a recreational-listing service for an exclusive network of recreational brokers.
In 2007, the Montana Wildlife Federation (MWF) waged a public campaign against Cabela's over its Cabela's Trophy Properties recreational real estate listing subsidiary and the perceived effect on hunter access in Montana. The controversy was sparked by the sale of several properties including key wildlife habitats, including the Weaver Ranch located north of Winnett, Montana. The Weaver Ranch had been part of Montana's Block Management Program (BMP), which compensates farmers and ranchers for providing public access to hunters.
The Montana Wildlife Federation argued that sales of recreational property often resulted in the withdrawal of the land from programs such as BMP, ultimately eliminating public access. Following discussions with MWF and other groups, Cabela's Trophy Properties in 2008 changed its approach to marketing its services and pledged to encourage public access and conservation.
In March 2014, Cabela's Trophy Properties was acquired by outdoor magazine Sports Afield, effectively ending Cabela's operations in real estate sales. Ironically, Richard Cabela, founder of Cabela's, would credit his first advertisement in Sports Afield magazine for helping him create the volume of sales necessary to later establish the company. Following its acquisition, Cabela's Trophy Properties was rebranded as Sports Afield Trophy Properties.

Jamaat Jund al-Qawqaz, originally formed as Ahrar al-Sharkas (Arabic: كتيبة أحرار ألشركس, The Free Circassian Battalion), was an armed group based in the Quneitra Governorate of Syria with some fighters in the Latakia Governorate. The group was made up of ethnic Circassians from Beer Ajam. The group came to prominence during the Quneitra Governorate clashes (2012–14).
History.
The group was founded by a local from Beer Ajam of Circassian descent who goes by the nom de guerre Abu Hatab al-Sharkassy who has expressed support for the Caucasus Emirate. In 2014 he declared allegiance to Ajnad al-Kavkaz, thus making Ahrar al-Sharkas part of it and moved some fighters to the Latakia Governorate to be closer to the central core of Ajnad al-Kavkaz. After their declaration of allegiance to Ajnad Al-Kavkaz, Ajnad Al-Kavkaz officially recognized itself as active in the Quneitra Governorate. The group chose to remain neutral in the conflict between ISIL and other rebel groups.

DISCERN

DISCERN is an instrument designed to provide users with a reliable way to measure the quality of written health information. It was originally developed by Deborah Charnock, Sasha Shepperd, Gill Needham, and Robert Gann, who reported on its development and validation in a February 1999 paper.
DISCERN is designed for use by individual consumers, health information providers, and health professionals. The instrument contains 15 questions that may be rated on a scale of 1–5. Questions are intended to draw user attention to issues of potential bias, content currency, relevance, clarity, evidence, and balance.
The DISCERN website was launched in May 1999. Despite originally being developed using printed materials, the tool has been shown to be effective at evaluating the quality of health information on the internet, as well as for printed information.

Terrifier

Terrifier is a 2016 American slasher film written, co-produced, and directed by Damien Leone. The film stars Jenna Kanell, Samantha Scaffidi, David Howard Thornton, and Catherine Corcoran. Thornton portrays the murderous Art the Clown, who hunts three young women played by Kannell, Scaffidi, and Corcoran on Halloween. It marks the second feature film appearance of the Art the Clown character, after Leone's 2013 anthology film "All Hallows' Eve", which incorporated footage from previous short films that were also directed by Leone and featured the character.
"Terrifier" premiered at the Telluride Horror Show Film Festival in October 2016 before being picked up by Dread Central Presents and Epic Pictures for a limited theatrical release in March 2018. A sequel, "Terrifier 2", is set to be released in early 2022.
Plot.
Monica Brown, a talk show host, interviews a severely disfigured woman who is the sole survivor of a massacre that took place the previous Halloween. Brown mentions that the body of the killer, known only as "Art the Clown", disappeared from the morgue, suggesting that he is still alive. However, the disfigured woman insists that she saw him die. After the show, Monica insults the woman's appearance, after which the woman attacks Monica and gouges her eyes out.
On Halloween night, two friends, Tara and Dawn, leave a Halloween party and drunkenly wander back to Dawn's car, where they notice a strange man in a clown costume. The man, Art the Clown, follows them into a nearby pizzeria. After a short time, the restaurant owner roughly escorts Art from the premises for smearing his own feces all over the bathroom walls. The girls discover that one of Dawn's car tires has been slashed, and Tara calls her sister Vicky to come pick them up. While waiting, Tara asks a pest control worker, Mike, if she can enter the derelict apartment building he's working in to use the restroom. Once inside, Tara encounters a deluded woman (credited as "Cat Person"), who believes the doll she carries is her infant child. Art returns to the pizzeria, where he kills and mutilates the two workers before abducting Dawn.
Tara soon encounters Art inside the apartment building. He pursues her through the indoor mechanic's garage and stabs her with a scalpel. She tries to alert Mike but Art drugs her. Tara awakens bound to a chair, and Art reveals Dawn, suspended upside-down from the ceiling. He forces Tara to watch as he saws Dawn in half with a handsaw. Tara escapes but Art draws a handgun and shoots her to death. The Cat Lady witnesses this and begs Mike to call the police. Mike dismisses her as insane, but Art soon knocks him unconscious with a hammer. The Cat Lady discovers Art cradling her doll. In a plea for the return of her "child", she tries to show motherly compassion to Art by cradling him.
Vicky arrives to take Tara and Dawn home but is lured into the basement by Art. There, she discovers what she believes is an injured Tara, but it is actually Art, who had severely mutilated the Cat Lady and is wearing her scalp and breasts. Mike's co-worker arrives looking for him but is decapitated by Art. Vicky escapes Art but stops to grieve upon finding her sister's corpse. Art then attacks her with a makeshift cat o' nine tails, but Mike arrives suddenly and knocks Art unconscious. The two flee and call 9-1-1 but before they can escape, Art appears and kills Mike. Vicky retreats into a garage, and Art rams through the door with a pickup truck, causing further injury to Vicky. As she lies helplessly, Art begins to eat her face. Police arrive, but Art shoots himself inside his mouth with a pistol before the officers can apprehend him.
Art's body is taken to a morgue, along with the bodies of his deceased victims. When the medical examiner unzips Art's body bag, Art reanimates and strangles him to death. One year later, Vicky is released from the hospital after rehabilitation from the injuries inflicted by Art; she is revealed to be the severely disfigured woman from the film's opening scene and thus the events of the entire movie took place that previous year.
Production.
The character of Art the Clown first appeared in the 2008 short film "The 9th Circle", which Leone wrote and directed. Leone later wrote and directed a short film titled "Terrifier", which featured Art and was released in 2011. These shorts were incorporated into the 2013 anthology film "All Hallows' Eve", which marked both Art's first feature film appearance and Leone's feature directorial debut.
In 2015, Leone launched a campaign on the crowdfunding website Indiegogo to finance "Terrifier", a feature-length spin-off of "All Hallows' Eve". After being notified of the Indiegogo campaign, filmmaker Phil Falcone provided the necessary funds for the project in exchange for a producer credit. In "The 9th Circle", the short film "Terrifier", and "All Hallows' Eve", Art was played by Mike Giannelli, but in the feature film "Terrifier", Art was portrayed by David Howard Thornton. Thornton was already familiar with "All Hallows' Eve" when he auditioned for the role of Art in "Terrifier", and was cast in the role after improvising a kill scene in mime.
Release.
"Terrifier" premiered at the Telluride Horror Show Film Festival in 2016. It was later screened at the Horror Channel FrightFest on October 28, 2017, and was subsequently picked up by Dread Central Presents and Epic Pictures for a limited 2018 release.
Home media.
"Terrifier" was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Dread Central on March 27, 2018. The release features audio commentary from Damien Leone and David H. Thornton, behind-the-scenes footage, an interview with star Jenna Kanell, deleted scenes, collectible reversible cover art, and several other bonus features.
Critical response.
The film received mixed to positive reviews. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, "Terrifier" holds an approval rating of 60% based on 15 reviews, and an average rating of 6.2/10. While Thornton's portrayal and the special effects were well received by critics, criticism of the film was directed mostly at the dialogue, acting in certain scenes, and the lack of character development of the protagonists.
Anton Bitel of the British Film Institute described the film as a "subtext-free thrill-and-kill ride which openly advertises the sheer senselessness and gratuity of all its on-screen cat-and-mouse deaths by numbers" and "an unapologetically ‘pure’ genre entry, confronting – and amusing – us with all the sinister masked vicariousness of the Halloween spirit." Cody Hamman of Arrow in the Head awarded the film a score of 8/10, calling it "a very simple film, providing 84 minutes of stalking and slashing that occurs largely within the confines of one location. Leone directs the hell out of that simple scenario, though, milking every possible bit of tension from each moment. It's a thrilling, brutal, gory '80s throwback that I recommend checking out, especially if you have a fondness for the same decade of films that this movie obviously holds in high regard." Sol Harris of the magazine "Starburst" gave the film a score of 6/10, writing: "Presented as something of a throwback to horror B-movies of the '80s, "Terrifier" has far more style - both visually and audibly - than the average film of this nature. It's a surprisingly nice looking film for a movie about a clown chopping people into pieces." Jeremy Aspinall of "Radio Times" praised the film, writing "But despite the unsparing gore, there's also plenty of atmosphere and a gnawing tension that's maintained all the way to the sequel-hinting climax."
The film was not without its detractors. Amyana Bartley of "FilmInquiry.com" felt that the film's script lacked both clear protagonists and depth, and wrote: "Art the Clown has the potential to be a formidable, gruesome, franchise horror character, he just needs more seasoning and cultivation." Felix Vasquez Jr. of Cinema Crazed called it "fairly mediocre slasher fare", stating that the film lacked any creativity and tension, also criticizing the film's storyline. Vasquez concluded his review by stating "As a film "Terrifier" aims high, but feels like a very disposable party favor you'll have forgotten once the credits roll."
Accolades.
The film received three "Fangoria" Chainsaw Award nominations: Best Limited Release, Best Supporting Actor (Thornton), and Best Makeup FX (Leone).
Sequel.
In February 2019, Damien Leone stated that a sequel for "Terrifier" was in production, with the other sequel's script having already been written. The film went into production in October 2019 with Fuzz on the Lens Productions as co-producers along with Dark Age Cinema. The film has delayed its final days of shooting due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Blue Velvet (Houston Person album)

Blue Velvet is an album by saxophonist Houston Person which was recorded in 2001 and released on the HighNote label.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Stewart Mason states " It's impossible to fault any of Houston Person's albums from this period, as the tenor saxophonist remains a sublimely gifted soloist with a gorgeous, well-rounded tone and a smartly melodic soloing sense ... This is undeniably fine music, but there's so little to differentiate this album from so many others that Houston Person has done that finally, it's primarily of interest either to die-hard fans or those who have near heard any albums from this period in Person's career. Honestly, if you've heard one, you've heard them all".
"The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings" describes "Blue Velvet" as one of Person’s best albums.

Ibrahim Basha

Ibrahim Basha Iddris also called Mallam Basha or Sheikh Bayaan, is a Ghanaian Islamic preacher, and one of the campaigners of the Sunni Islamic movement in Ghana. He founded Nuriyya Islamic Institute in Tamale in 1969 and is the leader of Masjidul Bayaan in Tamale.
He is widely considered to have been the initiator in transforming the traditional madrasas into Anglo-Arabic schooling and the pioneer of the creation of Ghana Islamic Education Unit.
Biography.
Early life.
Ibrahim was born in Kumasi but took his initial studies in Takoradi at Khairiyya Islamic School. He was taught by Hajj Shuab, a renowned Dagomba Islamic scholar. Ibrahim was given the nod to teach his colleagues as an advanced student. Later, he moved to Kumasi to study under Sheikh Ahmad Nurideen.
Coming to Tamale and Time at Anbariyya Islamic Institute.
Shiekh Basha occasionally visited his uncle Yusuf Soalih Ajura also known as Afa Ajura in Tamale. However, in the 1950s, he stayed permanently with Afa Ajura in Tamale and started teaching at the Anbariyya Islamic Institute. Notable amongst his students was Sheikh Saeed Abubakr Zakaria who is currently the leader of the Anbariyya Islamic Institute. Basha later left to form his own school.
Formation of Nuriyya Islamic Institute.
In the 1960s, Basha left Anbariyya Islamic Institute. Gow, Olonisakin, &amp; Dijxhoorn (2013) cited the lessening of Afa Ajura's Wahhabi doctrine, difference in interpretation as well as the infusion of secular education as the main cause. Subsequently, he established Madrasat Nuriyya in 1969 now Nuriyya Islamic Institute. Nuriyya Islamic Institute became one of the first Islamic schools to be transformed from teaching only Arabic to Anglo-Arabic.
Controversies.
Ibrahim has been alleged as being a Tijaniyyah and a Shi'a. However, he denied those charges. In his own account; he asserted that although he was taught by a scholar who happens to have practiced Tijaniyyah, he never succumbed to its practice that strayed from traditional Sunni. Furthermore, on the issue of being a Shi'a, he claimed that he was a friend to Shi'as but never practiced their movement.
Ibrahim is also alleged to be rival to the Anbariya Sunni Community as he has been severally accused of speaking against them in his sermons.

Sentimental Journey (Houston Person album)

Sentimental Journey is an album by saxophonist Houston Person which was recorded in 2002 and released on the HighNote label.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Scott Yanow states "As the 21st century began, Houston Person was one of the last in a tradition of tough-toned but warm tenors able to straddle the boundaries between soul-jazz, hard bop, and soulful R&amp;B. An expert at caressing and uplifting melodies, Person plays in the tradition of Gene Ammons. Person is in excellent form throughout this quartet/quintet date ... "Sentimental Journey" is a strong example of his talents". In JazzTimes, David Franklin wrote: "Houston Person is still carrying on the great tenor saxophone tradition that combines breathy soulfulness with blues-drenched, stomping swing. The lush-toned tenorist’s latest release, "Sentimental Journey", verifies his continuing command of the idiom. ... It’s an increasingly rare pleasure to hear a sensitive player like Houston Person pay respect to great melodies, rendering them essentially as written. But it’s also good that his new record offers plenty of opportunities for straightahead blowing by some fine improvisers".

Liberation Movement (music group)

Liberation Movement is a music and art collective founded in 2010 by Resurrector (Grant Chambers) in San Francisco, CA. Liberation Movement evolved out of San Francisco-based underground music project Heavyweight Dub Champion. The collective has become known for its live performances and as of 2020 has not officially released any recorded material. They have performed at many music festivals throughout the Americas. Reality Sandwich calls Liberation Movement "a new collaborative music project that pushes the boundaries of human experience". Jambase described their 2013 Symbiosis Gathering performance as "one of the most moving, mind-blowing musical experiences in recent memory."
Formation.
Liberation Movement was created among a wide variety of ambitious goals : "to bring greater appreciation for process", "to redefine the way our culture relates to age and wisdom", and "to truly generate the possibility of personal and collective evolution". Chambers explains in an interview with "Reality Sandwich": 
He says he chose the name because "speaking the name is a revolutionary potential in and of itself.
Peruvian Connection.
In 2010, Chambers "went to Peru to learn about how music and vibration are connected to shamanism". This led to him recording more than 25 indigenous singers from the Shipibo Tribe at the Temple Of The Way Of Light near Iquitos, Peru and produce and release the album "Onáyabaon Bewá - Messages from Mother Earth" by "Shamans of the Temple of the Way of Light". This experience also led to a rebranding of Liberation Movement.
In 2014, in collaboration with Peruvian-based NGO Alianza Arkana and the Rubin Foundation, he returned to Peru with bandmates Sasha Rose, Noah King and filmmakers Mitch Schultz (Writer/Director of "DMT: The Spirit Molecule"), Donald Schultz and Jason Gamble Harter to document a 3-week journey to the Peruvian Amazon.
"Jiwexon Axebo" Concert in Pucallpa.
Liberation Movement teamed up with Alianza Arkana and ORAU (the regional political organization of the National Federation of Amazonian Indigenous Peoples) on a concert event held in Pucallpa, Peru called "Jiwexon Axebo" in the Shipibo Tribe's language and "Cultural Revival" in English. The Shipibo traditional singers Maestro Diogenes Garcia and Maestro Olivia Arevalo performed with Liberation Movement.
Olivia Arévalo Lomas.
Often heralded as the leader and "spiritual mother" of the indigenous Shipibo-konibo community, Maestra Olivia Arévalo Lomas who both performed and recorded with Liberation Movement was tragically murdered in April 2018 at her home. She is featured on the Resurrector produced album "Onáyabaon Bewá – Messages from Mother Earth".
Live Performance.
Liberation Movement has received many accolades for its live performances and they have performed at festivals including Lightning in a Bottle, Symbiosis Gathering, Sonic Bloom, Joshua Tree Music Festival, Envision in Costa Rica, Atmosphere Gathering in Canada and many others. A review by Everfest of their performance at the Oregon Eclipse Festival in 2017 stated that Liberation Movement "shone brightest among the Earth Stage's magnificent programming ... Resurrector himself, Grant Chambers, provided a veritable séance in deep dubby beat-science ... This was a spiritualized journey that burrowed many thousands of leagues beneath the Earth's surface, penetrating the consciousness of all who had assembled."
Liberation Movement live performances often feature a wide variety of collaborators and guests from varied genres including Peruvian shamans, champion Tuvan throat singer Soriah, Butoh dance troupe Bad Unkl Sista, SORNE and many others.
Collaborators and Guest Performers.
Liberation Movement is a collective conglomerate with a massive variety of contributors.

Becca Kufrin

Rebecca Jill Kufrin (born April 3, 1990) is an American publicist and television personality, best known for her role as the winner on the 22nd season of ABC's "The Bachelor" and the lead of the 14th season of "The Bachelorette".
Early life and education.
Kufrin was born in Benson, Minnesota, and raised in Prior Lake, Minnesota, the daughter of Jill and Steve Kufrin. She has an older sister named Emily. Kufrin graduated from Prior Lake High School in 2008, and obtained her Bachelor of Science degree in Mass Communications from Minnesota State University, Mankato in 2012. Her father died of brain cancer when Kufrin was 19 years old and her mother is a breast cancer survivor.
Career.
Before appearing on "The Bachelor", she was working at Skyya Communications, a technology public relations agency based in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Television shows.
"The Bachelor".
Kufrin was a contestant on Arie Luyendyk Jr.'s season of "The Bachelor". After making it to the final 3, her ex-boyfriend Ross Jirgl showed up in Peru and proposed; Kufrin declined. She was initially chosen by Luyendyk as the winner and accepted his proposal at the end of the season. However, Luyendyk dumped Kufrin for the runner-up Lauren Burnham before the season finished airing. The break-up was filmed and the raw, unedited footage was shown on the first night of the two-night finale, a first for "The Bachelor".
Response.
After Luyendyk ended his engagement with Kufrin on air, Minnesota State Representative Drew Christensen fans raised over $6,000 for Kufrin through the Venmo app, which Kufrin in turn donated to Stand Up to Cancer. Her donation was matched by ABC and later matched again by Katie Couric. "The Bachelor" season 20 lead, Ben Higgins, also pledged to donate the profits from each bag of coffee sold from his company for a 24-hour period. The day after the breakup aired, 12 billboards went up in Kufrin's hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota, as well as 4 in Los Angeles and 1 in Times Square, all showing their support for Kufrin and disgust at Luyendyk's actions. During the March 10, 2018 episode of "Saturday Night Live", Cecily Strong portrayed Kufrin in the cold-open, parodying the break-up.
"The Bachelorette".
Kufrin was announced as the Bachelorette on March 6, 2018, on ABC's "After the Final Rose" special. The season premiered on May 25, 2018. In the end, Kufrin chose Garrett Yrigoyen over runner-up Blake Horstmann. During the finale, she and Yrigoyen were given a minivan from ABC as a gift. The couple were engaged and moved to Carlsbad, California, where they lived with their adopted corgi, Minno. On September 1, 2020, Kufrin and Yrigoyen announced the end of their engagement.
"Bachelor in Paradise".
Kufrin made a brief appearance during season five of "Bachelor in Paradise" to give advice to the girls and give closure to Colton Underwood. On August 9, 2021, Becca was confirmed to be a contestant on season seven.

Alcotomic

Alcotomic were a power pop band formed in Melbourne, Victoria, February 1996. Initially the band was called Dozer and the first recording session commenced at the original Birdland Recording Studios in High Street Prahran, Victoria with record producer Lindsay Gravina. This line up consisted of John Freeman Baxter (Holocene) on vocals and guitar, Denny Brereton (Porcelain Jane) on bass and Stephen Boyle (Moler) on drums.
History.
Drummer Andy Strachan joined the band on drums in October 1996 and their five track self-titled debut EP often called "playing cards" due to the cover artwork, was released August 1997. The single Living In Luxury featured on Australian TV drama's Stingers and Good Guys, Bad Guys. "Inpress" Magazine's Natalie McPhee wrote: "This debut is filled with 6 examples of just how Alcotomic are able to manipulate the sounds of a three piece and make it all their own. I am in love with this voice, deep and husky it sits beautifully within the arrangements that Alcotomic create."
January 1998 saw the band travel to Sydney, New South Wales to work with producer and former Bell Jar keyboardist David "DP" Price at Velvet Sound Studios on what would become their follow up three track EP called Anything But You. Released by MGM Distribution July 4, the single went on to rotation on the national youth radio station Triple J and the band made an appearance on the ABC TV's "Recovery" program. Shortly after, they signed with US indie record label Not Lame Records and were selected as most promising artist 1998 to perform before industry professionals at the Pacific Circle Music Conference in Sydney, November 1998. Alex Wheaton from "dB" Magazine wrote: "Three songs only on this glorious little record from Melbourne's Alcotomic. Well crafted and airy harmonies of 'Invisible' are what set this song apart and the more stop/start percussive drive of 'Black Or White' utilizes a more complex arrangement."
In mid 1998, bassist Denny Brereton departed and Strachan's housemate Paul Inglis also from Adelaide joined the band on bass guitar. Early 1999, the band performed their 100th live show and were filmed by RMITV performing live at the Punters Club Hotel in Fitzroy on 2 December. The trio returned to Birdland Studio's to again work with producer Lindsay Gravina in May 1999 to cut what would become their penultimate EP. Released July 2000 on Magneto/MGM, Where You Go went on to receive glowing reviews and further radio support from Triple J and community radio stations. "Sanity" Magazine single pick of the week remarked: "Where You Go is an intoxicating blend of melody, cracking riffs, cute keyboard squelch, heavy bass, endearing husky vocals and a whole lotta fun".
By early 2001, band members were branching out into other projects with Strachan joining Sydney band Pollyanna, and Baxter and Inglis working on new band, Prettymess. Shortly thereafter, Strachan joined Australian chart topping band the Living End. The last live appearance of Alcotomic was on 1 August 2001 in Melbourne at the 9th Ward Bar, 298 Flinders Lane, Melbourne.

Prince Eunsin

Prince Eunsin (; 11 January 1755 – 29 March 1771), personal name Yi Jin (), was a Korean prince, as the fourth son of Crown Prince Sado, and his concubine, Royal Noble Consort Suk of the Buan Im clan.
He later become the heir of Prince Yeollyeong, the younger half-brother of King Gyeongjong and King Yeongjo.
Life.
Prince Eunsin was the second illegitimate son of Crown Prince Sado, born to Royal Noble Consort Suk of the Buan Im clan. He was the younger brother of Prince Euneon and half-brother of Crown Prince Uiso, Jeongjo of Joseon and Prince Eunjeon.
In 1762, when his father was executed by King Yeongjo for treason, he was left unprotected and in poverty. He and his brother, Prince Euneon, had to borrow money from merchants and from Hong Bong-han, the father of Crown Prince Sado's primary wife, and over time, the two accumulated a substantial debt.
In 1769, Prince Eunsin married Lady Hong of Namyang (1755 – 1829), daughter of an official named Hong Dae-hyeon. They had no issue.
On February 2, 1771, King Yeongjo sent him to exile in Daejeong, on Jeju Island. Less than two months later, on March 29, he became sick from an epidemic and died, at the age of 16.
Aftermath.
In 1776, according to the will of King Yeongjo, King Jeongjo, the prince's older brother, posthumously appointed him to be the heir to Prince Yeollyeong, who was his great-uncle. Whereas being the successor of Prince Yeollyeong, Prince Eunsin was not regarded as the adopted son of Prince Nakcheon, who used to be the heir to Prince Yeollyeong, but he was deprived of the status during the reign of Jeongjo.
On December 12, 1779, he was given the posthumous name "Somin" (); it was changed to "Chungheon" () on February 28, 1871.
In 1815, during the reign of King Sunjo, Yi Chae-jung (이채중), a fifth-great-grandson of King Injo, was appointed to be Prince Eunsin's adopted son. He was given a new name, Yi Gu (), and received the title Prince Namyeon (; 1788-1836).

Romanticism in evolution theory

Romanticism was an intellectual movement that arose in the late eighteenth century and continued through the nineteenth century. The movement had roots in the arts, literature, and science. Largely conceived as a reaction towards the extreme rationalism of the Enlightenment, it championed expressing emotions through aesthetic and emphasizing the transcendent allure of the natural world.
There has been significant work done by historians about how romanticism played a significant role in the development of modern theories of evolution. Most notable is the work done by Robert J. Richards, a professor at the University of Chicago. Richards, and others, have contributed significantly to the conversation about how Romanticism plays a significant role in evolution theory, especially in regards to German Romanticism.
Alexander von Humboldt.
Romantic contributions to Darwin's theory of evolution.
Charles Darwin became acquainted with Humboldt's exploration and science during while studying at Cambridge. Here, Darwin was taken under the direction of John Stevens Henslow (1796–1861), Professor of Botany, who strongly encouraged Darwin to travel and study nature. Henslow also encouraged Darwin to read Alexander von Humboldt's manuscripts on exploring nature, and it was, at least in part, Humboldt's work that inspired Darwin's romantic notion of travel and discovery.
Prior to Darwin's departure on the "H.M.S. Beagle", Henslow bestowed to Darwin the English translation of Humboldt's "Relation historique du voyage aux regions equinoxiales du nouveau continent," which the translator (Helen Maria Williams) called "Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America". Darwin read Humboldt's "Personal Narrative" thoroughly while on his own journey of scientific exploration on board the "Beagle".
Interactions through letters.
Darwin and Humboldt spent their later years exchanging letters and manuscripts. After reading Darwin's writings from the "Beagle", Humboldt wrote to Darwin: “You told me in your kind letter that, when you were young, the manner in which I studied and depicted nature in the torrid zones contributed toward exciting in you the ardor and desire to travel in distant lands.  Considering the importance of your work, Sir, this may be the greatest success that my humble work could bring.  Works are of value only if they give rise to better ones.
The two men finally met in person in 1842. Humboldt died in 1859, sixth months before the first edition of "On the Origin of Species" was published. In letters to his close friend Joseph Dalton Hooker, Darwin reflected that his "whole course of life" was due to having read Humboldt's "Personal Narrative" and conclusively praised Humboldt as the "Greatest scientific traveller who ever lived."
Romantic style in evolution theory.
Historians have noted that Humboldt's vision of aesthetic appraisal and science was incredibly comprehensive and modern for his time: consequently, his work contributed to advancing observation in geography, geophysics, and natural history. It has also been noted that Darwin's aesthetic approach to the natural world through his explorations and consequent observations was influenced by Humboldt's excursions and literature.
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (28 August 1749 – 22 March 1832) was a German Romantic poet, playwright, novelist, scientist, artist, and statesman whose works contributed significantly to natural history.
Romantic contributions to evolutionary science.
Morphology.
In 1790, Goethe wrote "Versuch die Metamorphose der Pflanzen zu erklären (Metamorphosis of Plants") and "Zur Morphologie", creating the scientific field of morphology, the branch of study in biology that deals with the structural forms of organisms. In his texts, Goethe used morphology to describe homology between parts of different organisms (for example, comparing the arm of a human to the fin of a whale). Goethe further suggested that adaptive modifications in an organism's parts were all relative to a "Bauplan," an idealized, common archetype. Robert J. Richards suggests that "Versuch die Metamorphose der Pflanzen zu erklären" transformed biological sciences during this time period. Historian Joan Steigerwald suggests that Goethe's morphology was inherently Romantic, as they were idealistic. She also argues that Goethe's experiences with nature and aesthetics were the driving factors in his postulation of an "ideal" form (the "Bauplan").
Legacy.
Later evolutionists, including Carl Gegenbaur and Ernst Haeckel, used phenotypic variation first described by Goethe in his texts about morphology to advance the understanding of evolution. As a Romantic, Goethe also paved the way for equally influential Romantic-scientists, including Alexander von Humboldt and Friedrich Schelling. Professor Robert J. Richards of the University of Chicago argues that it was both the Romantic perspectives of Schelling and Goethe which paved the way for a nature-centric understanding of evolution.
Erasmus Darwin.
Brief biography.
Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin, was born in Nottinghamshire on 12 December 1731 and died on 18 April 1802. He was a successful physician, botanist, and poet who contributed heavily to evolution theory through his works as a writer-naturalist. Though he is most often linked to the Age of Enlightenment and was an enthusiastic proponent of Materialism, Erasmus Darwin's literary contributions popularized interest in the natural world, connecting him to the Romantic movement as well.
Naturalistic Poetry.
In the late 1770s, Erasmus Darwin diverged from his work as a well-known physician due to his interest in botany. In 1789, he composed "The Love of Plants" which was a collection of poetic verses concerning Carolus Linnaeus's taxonomic system, which he revered deeply. This book was so successful that Erasmus Darwin later included it in "The Botanic Garden" (1791), which was composed of two poems, "The Economy of Vegetation" and "The Loves of Plants." "The Economy of Vegetation" is focused on the evolution of mankind through technology and innovation and argues that industrialization was part of a single evolutionary process.
Conversely, "The Loves of Plants" was focused on uniting nature with man through the appreciation of botany. In it, Darwin encourages humans to study botany because plants are a part of the same natural world as man. He also argues that sexual reproduction gives rise to phenotypic change (which his grandson would later incorporate into his own theory of evolution put forth in "On the Origin of Species").In 1794, Erasmus Darwin also wrote "Zoonomia", another book of verse, this time dealing with human physiology. In this volume, Erasmus Darwin presents himself as a Lamarckian evolutionist, advocating the "inheritance of acquired characteristics" theory. He also suggests a theory of pangenesis in the third volume of "Zoonomia", a hypothesis Charles Darwin later propelled. The theories posited in "Zoonomia" are some of the first formal theories on evolution.
Erasmus Darwin's direct contributions to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.
Although Erasmus Darwin died seven years before Charles Darwin was born, the younger Darwin was not without his grandfather's teachings and works. Charles Darwin read "Zoonomia" when he was 18 years old and found it inspirational.
However, as Charles Darwin got older, he began to resent Erasmus Darwin's work. In the "short historical preface" of his 1860 publication of "Origin," Darwin denounced Lamarck's belief in "a law of progressive development," followed by a footnote: “It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin, anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of Lamarck in his "Zoonomia"'”. Erasmus Darwin, a proponent of Atheism, Materialism, and also provocative Romanticism, faced many obstacles in popularizing his views on evolution despite his success as a popular poet. Lamarck had faced similar dissent. Darwin wished to avoid this association, which could impede on his own popularity among the public and the scientific community. In 1879, Charles Darwin had become so polarized in his opinions about his grandfather that when wrote a biography on his grandfather titled "The Life of Erasmus Darwin", it contained so much crudeness that Charles Darwin's daughter, Henriette Darwin, supposedly edited out 16% of the biography.

Alan Woods (gambler)

Alan Woods (1945 – 26 January 2008) was an Australian and Hong Kong professional gambler and mathematician considered among the biggest gamblers in the world.
Woods focused on blackjack and betting on horse racing. He has worked with Bill Benter and Zeljko Ranogajec during his career and "pioneered quantitative gambling by betting on Hong Kong horse races". His estimated net worth at the time of his death was AU$670 million.
Early life.
Woods was raised in Murwillumbah, New South Wales, Australia. His parents ran a newsagency, followed by a cordial factory and a hotel. Woods was not exposed to gambling in his youth and played solo whist with his family. He studied mathematics at the University of New England, in Armidale but dropped out his final year before graduating. There Woods began playing poker machines and described himself as a losing player. He stopped due to a relocation to Sydney where poker machines were not available. He also worked for a time as an insurance actuary.
Woods also picked up horse betting during college and won his first bet. Unlike in poker and solo, Woods was generally losing betting on horses and developed a gambling habit.
Gambling career.
Woods was introduced to card counting in blackjack from his fellow bridge players. He tested the method and won a few thousand dollars. Woods did not focus on gambling seriously until his wife left him in 1979. Afterwards, he played blackjack in Hobart and won $16,000 in four months. He moved to Las Vegas where he won an additional $100,000.
Woods retired from professional blackjack in 1982 and focused on horse betting in Hong Kong due to the small pool of horses. There he met Bob Moore and Bill Benter. Benter and Woods worked on a computer model "based on mathematics, to choose race winners based on formulaic consideration of track, form, weather and other factors". The model began generating $100,000 in the 1987 racing season. That same year Benter and Woods dissolved the partnership.
Woods traveled to Manila and worked with Zeljko Ranogajec, who he also described as a rival. By the 1990s, Woods had won millions from horse betting.
Personal life.
Woods married Meredith in 1972; the two separated in 1979. They had two children, Anthony and Vicky. Woods was against the Iraq War and described himself as a former conservative turned liberal.
Death.
Woods died of appendiceal cancer on 25 January 2008 shortly after he was diagnosed.

Frances Daisy Emery Allen

Dr. Frances Daisy Emery Allen (1876–1958) was a pioneering physician in Fort Worth, Texas. She was the first female graduate of a medical college in the state of Texas and one of the first female physicians to practice in Tarrant County.
Early life.
Frances Daisy Emery was born September 5, 1876, in Kaufman County, Texas, to James Wallace and Elizabeth Brown Emery. James Wallace Emery had a master's degree from Bowdoin College and had been an outspoken abolitionist in the 1850s. The ninth of twelve children, four-year-old Daisy announced her intentions to become a doctor, a goal encouraged by her parents. The Emery family moved to Fort Worth when Daisy was fourteen years old. She attended Fort Worth public schools, where her father was also a teacher, and graduated from Fort Worth High School.
Medical Training and Career.
Daisy Emery applied to and was initially refused admission to the medical college of Fort Worth University, but was admitted when she pointed out that no rules specifically excluded women from the school. She was thus admitted to the charter class of Fort Worth Medical College (also known as Fort Worth Medical School and Fort Worth School of Medicine) in 1894, where she was the only female student for a full year. In 1897 she graduated with honors, ranking second in a class of seventeen students. She had the distinction of being the first woman to graduate from a medical college in Texas.
Dr. Emery worked in private practice in Fort Worth for two years, making her one of the first female physicians in the Tarrant County. She also worked as an evaluating physician for Penn Mutual Life Insurance's female applicants. In 1899, she moved to Washington, D.C. for postgraduate education. She lived with a married sister in Maryland while completing an internship and residency at Women and Children's Hospital in Washington. There she became involved in women's suffrage, developing an interest in women's voting rights, attending lectures by Susan B. Anthony and other activists, and even sewing her own bloomers. Dr. Daisy Emery returned to Texas in 1901 to care for her mother, who was suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, and accepted a teaching position at Dallas Medical College.
On November 30, 1903, Frances Daisy Emery married James Walter Allen, a classmate from Fort Worth Medical College with whom she had remained a relationship. Allen was a native of White Settlement, in western Tarrant County.The couple moved to Vinson, Oklahoma Territory, where Dr. Walter Allen had opened a medical practice, but were forced to again relocate when most of the town—including their home—was destroyed in a fire initially caused by a tornado.
From 1904 to 1910, the couple shared a medical practice in the town of Content, in Runnels County, Texas, where they had an office with a small pharmacy adjoining their house. The rural setting required most of their practice to consist of house calls, first by horse and buggy, then bicycle, then motorcycle, and finally a small automobile. The Allens' first daughter, Frances Marion, was born during their time in Content.
In 1910, the Allens moved their practice a few miles east to Goldsboro, Texas, where their second daughter, Sheila Emery, was born; in 1912, they relocated again to Newark, Texas, about 20 miles northwest of Fort Worth. In December 1913, the Allens were planning to move to China as missionaries when Walter died unexpectedly during surgery to remove kidney stones.
Finding herself a widow at the age of 37, Dr. Daisy Emery Allen packed up her two young children and returned to Fort Worth. She served as clinical professor of children's diseases at Fort Worth Medical College until Fort Worth University closed in 1917 and its medical school, which had been chartered separately, merged with Baylor College of Medicine. She entered a practice with two male physicians in the Fort Worth National Bank building, then opened her own office serving women and children in the new Medical Arts Building in 1931.
Dr. Daisy Emery Allen served on the staffs of Harris, All Saints, and St. Joseph hospitals in Fort Worth. She also treated patients at free clinics at City-County Hospital and the Wesley Center, where she delivered many of Fort Worth's babies. She was a founding member of the Fort Worth Academy of Medicine, a member of the Tarrant County Medical Society, the Tarrant County Association for Mental Health, the American Medical Women's Association, and was a life member of the Texas Medical Association. She was also an early member of the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce.
Dr. Daisy Emery Allen was a member of the League of Women Voters. She traveled extensively in the United States and Europe with her daughters and took them to political rallies. With her mother's influence, her daughter, Frances, became a social worker and pioneering advocate for child welfare in Texas and Illinois.
Retirement and Death.
Dr. Frances Daisy Emery Allen retired from medicine in 1950, having practiced for more than half a century. She died of heart disease in Fort Worth on December 7, 1958 and was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Fort Worth. At her death, she owned extensive property in Runnels, Callahan, and Tarrant Counties, having accepted property in lieu of payment from patients. She is noted on the Texas Historical Marker at the site of the Fort Worth Medical College, near the intersection of 4th and Jones Streets in downtown Fort Worth.

Veronica Escobar

Veronica Escobar (born September 15, 1969) is an American politician serving as the U.S. Representative for , based in El Paso, since 2019. A member of the Democratic Party, she served as an El Paso County Commissioner from 2007 to 2011 and the El Paso County Judge from 2011 until 2017.
Early life and education.
Escobar is a native of El Paso, where she was born in 1969. She grew up near her family's dairy farm with her parents and four brothers. Escobar attended Loretto Academy and Burges High School, before getting her bachelor's degree at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and her master's degree from New York University.
Early political career.
Escobar worked as a nonprofit executive and as Raymond Caballero's communications director when he was mayor of El Paso. When Caballero failed to get reelected, Escobar—along with Susie Byrd, attorney Steve Ortega and businessman Beto O'Rourke—considered entering public service; they started to discuss grassroots strategies with the goals of improving urban planning, creating a more diversified economy with more highly skilled jobs, as well as ending systemic corruption among city leadership.
Escobar was elected as a County Commissioner of El Paso County in 2006 and as the County Judge of El Paso County in 2010. O’Rourke, Byrd and Ortega also all ran for office and won; they came to be collectively referred to as "The Progressives." She also taught English and Chicano literature at UTEP and El Paso Community College.
U.S. House of Representatives.
Elections.
Escobar resigned from office in August 2017 to run full-time in the 2018 election to succeed Beto O'Rourke in the United States House of Representatives for . As the district is a solidly Democratic, majority-Hispanic district, whoever won the Democratic primary was heavily favored in November. Escobar won the six-way Democratic primary with 61% of the vote.
In June 2018, Escobar and O'Rourke led protests in Tornillo, Texas, against the Trump administration family separation policy that involved separating immigrant children from their families. Tornillo is just miles from the Rio Grande, the river that forms the border between the U.S. and Mexico in Texas. The Trump administration had created a "tent-city" in Tornillo, where separated children were being held without their parents. O'Rourke called this practice "un-American" and the responsibility of all Americans.
Escobar won the general election on November 6, defeating Republican Rick Seeberger. She became the first woman to represent the 16th. Escobar and Sylvia Garcia of Houston became the first Latina congresswomen from Texas. Although the 16th has been a majority-Hispanic district since at least the 1970s, Escobar is only the second Hispanic ever to represent it, the first being Silvestre Reyes, O'Rourke's predecessor.
Escobar ran for reelection. She was unopposed in the Democratic primary and faced the Republican nominee, realtor Irene Armendariz-Jackson, in the general election. Escobar won with 64.7% of the vote to Armendariz-Jackson's 35.3%.
Tenure.
On November 13, 2019, Escobar was elected as a freshman class representative in a secret ballot by her peers, filling the role of Katie Hill, who had resigned from Congress.
On February 4, 2020, Escobar delivered the Spanish-language response to President Trump's State of the Union Address. Her remarks touched on healthcare, immigration, the national debt, the importance of diversity, the 2019 mass shooting in El Paso, wealth inequality, gun violence, and the United States–Mexico–Canada trade agreement. She called Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate "the greatest threat to our security." 
Personal life.
Escobar and her husband, Michael Pleters, have two children.

Chen Xiaolu

Chen Xiaolu (; 30 July 1946 – 28 February 2018) was a Chinese military officer and businessman. As a son of Marshal Chen Yi, he was one of China's most prominent princelings, or children of high officials. He held the rank of colonel when he quit his military and government posts in 1992 and entered business. His military background and princeling status helped his businesses expand to great sizes. He was an early director of privately held Anbang, which grew into an insurance giant. In 2013, he made national headlines when he publicly confessed and apologized for torturing and persecuting his teachers during the Cultural Revolution. He has been called the "conscience" of princelings.
Early life.
Chen was born on 30 July 1946 in the Yi-Meng Mountains in Linyi, Shandong, where his father Chen Yi was the commander of the Shandong Field Army during the Chinese Civil War. He was the youngest of Chen Yi's three sons and his name Xiaolu was from the Confucian classic text "Mencius".
After the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Chen Yi served as Mayor of Shanghai and Commander of the East China Military Region, and Xiaolu spent his early school years in Nanjing and Shanghai. When he was eight, his father was appointed Vice Premier and his family moved to Beijing, where he studied at Beijing No. 4 High School and Beijing No. 8 High School.
Cultural Revolution.
When the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, Chen joined the Red Guards and tortured and persecuted his teachers. He later confessed that he participated in organizing public struggle sessions against the teachers which often turned violent. He told Jane Perlez of "The New York Times" that the school's party chief, Hua Jia, committed suicide after being imprisoned in a storeroom and beaten for two weeks. She had been a party member for 30 years.
When more radical groups began to attack Communist Party leaders, Chen organized the "Beijing Xicheng District Red Guard Picket Corps" to defend the leaders such as his father. When Chen Yi, then serving as Foreign Minister of China, criticized the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong sidelined him and the Red Guards occupied the Foreign Ministry. Premier Zhou Enlai sent Chen Xiaolu to the army for his safety.
Public apologies.
In 2013, before the 50th anniversary of the Cultural Revolution, Chen issued a public apology to the teachers he and his classmates tortured. As president of the alumni association of Beijing No. 8 High School, he posted the following message on the alumni website:
As a student leader at Number Eight Middle School and the director of the school's Revolutionary Committee, I bear direct responsibility for the denouncing and criticism of school leaders, some teachers and students. In the early stages of the movement, I actively rebelled and organized the denouncements of school leaders. Later on when I served as the director of the school's Revolutionary Committee, I wasn't brave enough to stop the inhumane persecutions, because I feared I would be accused of protecting the old ways and being counter-revolutionary.
He explained that he was worried about the recent trend in China to reverse the repudiation of the Cultural Revolution, and concluded: "My official apology comes too late, but for the purification of the soul, the progress of society, the future of the nation, one must make this kind of apology." In October 2013, he apologized to his old teachers again in person when he visited the No. 8 School for an alumni reunion.
Chen's public apology made headlines nationwide and caused much online debate over the Cultural Revolution. Many praised him, but others criticized him for "picking over old wounds". Historian Xu Youyu considers his apology "very unusual", as former Red Guards generally describe themselves as victims of the Cultural Revolution and de-emphasize their own wrongdoings. Chen has been called the "conscience" of princelings.
Career.
After the Cultural Revolution, Chen worked for a few years as an assistant defence attaché in the Chinese embassy in London, before returning to China in 1985. He subsequently worked for the liberal Central Office for Political Structure Reform under Bao Tong, assistant to the reformist leader Zhao Ziyang, and called for the establishment of independent workers' unions. The proposed political reforms were aborted after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the subsequent crackdown. Chen, then with the rank of colonel, left the government and the military in 1992.
Chen went into business after leaving the government, and his princeling status and military background helped his businesses expand to "staggering" sizes. He was an early director of Anbang, founded by Wu Xiaohui, which grew from a small car dealer and insurance company into an insurance giant and bought the iconic Waldorf Astoria New York Hotel in 2014. However, Chen said he was merely an advisor and not a shareholder.
Personal life.
In 1975, Chen married Su Huining (粟惠宁), the daughter of General Su Yu, Marshal Chen Yi's second in command.
Death.
On 28 February 2018, Chen died in Hainan following a heart attack, at the age of 71.

Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians

The Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians (often abbreviated Magnesians or Ign. Mag.) is an epistle attributed to Ignatius of Antioch, a second-century bishop of Antioch, and addressed to the church in Magnesia on the Maeander. It was written during Ignatius' transport from Antioch to his execution in Rome.
Composition.
"Magnesians" is one of seven epistles attributed to Ignatius that are generally accepted as authentic. In 5th century, this collection was enlarged by spurious letters.
It is clear that "Magnesians" was written soon before the martyrdom of Ignatius, but it is uncertain when precisely this martyrdom occurred. Tradition places the martyrdom of Ignatius in the reign of Trajan, who was emperor of Rome from 98 to 117 AD. While many scholars accept the traditional dating of Ignatius' martyrdom under Trajan, others have argued for a somewhat later date. Richard Pervo dated Ignatius' death to 135-140 AD, and British classicist Timothy Barnes has argued for a date some time in the 140s AD.
Background.
The Magnesian and Trallian churches had sent their bishops, Polybius of Trallis and Damas, in company with two presbyters from Magnesia to meet Ignatius who was being held at the nearby port of Smyrna on his way to execution in Rome, and Ignatius writes his letter to thank the Magnesian church.
Content.
The epistle calls for unity and submission in the church. Ignatius also cautions against "false doctrines." In particular, he attacks those Jewish Christians who continued to observe the Torah:
He also advocates the idea that Christians should observe the Lord's Day every Sunday, rather than the Jewish Sabbath on Saturdays:

Wilson v. Sellers

Wilson v. Sellers, 584 U.S. ___ (2018), is a United States Supreme Court case concerning whether a federal court sitting in a habeas corpus proceeding should "look through" a summary ruling to review the last reasoned decision by a state court.
In 1997, a Georgia jury convicted Marion Wilson of murder and sentenced him to death. In December 1999, the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed on direct appeal. Wilson next petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in state court. The petition was denied in a written opinion by the state superior court, which was summarily affirmed by the state supreme court, and denied review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Wilson then filed another petition for habeas corpus, now in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, which was denied. In December 2014, a unanimous panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, also rejecting Wilson's petition. In August 2016, the full "en banc" Eleventh Circuit again rejected the petition by a vote of 6–5, with Circuit Judge William H. Pryor Jr. writing for the majority and Circuit Judges Adalberto Jordan and Jill A. Pryor writing dissents.
The Court announced judgment in favor of the prisoner on April 17, 2018, reversing and remanding to the lower court by a vote of 6–3. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the Court, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, as well as Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. The Court held that the circuit had erred under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 by failing to consider the reasoning in the lower, earlier, written, state court opinion. Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, dissented.
In August 2018, the Eleventh Circuit again denied Wilson's petition, in another opinion by Judge Pryor. Wilson was executed by lethal injection on June 20, 2019.

To Etta with Love

To Etta with Love is an album by saxophonist Houston Person which was recorded in 2004 and released on the HighNote label. The album is a tribute to Person's musical partner Etta Jones.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Matt Collar states ""To Etta With Love" finds Person digging into various standards that Jones loved throughout her career. There is a melancholy, heartbreaking quality to these tracks. ... The journeyman's warm, burnished tenor sound veritably weeps and more often soars ... Much like the singer Person knew, "To Etta With Love" is an understated, moving, and swinging elegy". On All About Jazz, John Kelman noted "In a career filled with highs, one thing that made Jones and Person so well-known was their commitment to playing in smaller neighbourhood clubs that others would pass by. With "To Etta With Love" Person delivers a bittersweet love letter that has all the dusky ambience of one of those dimly-lit establishments ... it's vital that younger listeners be aware of the vibrant history that has brought jazz to where it is today. "To Etta With Love" combines rich history with tribute, evocatively showing just how much the landscape of jazz has changed". In JazzTimes, David Franklin wrote: "Person’s playing is predictably wistful and pensive. Indeed, on several tunes, including Etta’s two hits, he merely caresses the songs’ original themes with his gorgeous tone and breathy attack rather than create melodies of his own".

Prince Nakcheon

Prince Nakcheon (; November 26, 1720 – September 28, 1737) was a royal family member of the Joseon dynasty. His name was Yi On () while he was originally named Yi Susin (); his courtesy name was "Onjung" ().
Prince Nakcheon was by birth the only son of Yi Chae (), and he later became an adoptive son of late Prince Yeollyeong in 1734.
Biography.
Life.
Prince Nakcheon was born as the only son of Yi Chae and Lady Yu of the Jinju Yu clan (daughter of Yu Man-jung). Through Yi Chae, he was a 4-great-grandson of Prince Gyeongchang (9th son of King Seonjo).
Prior to the adoption, Prince Yeollyeong, the youngest son of King Sukjong, died without issue in 1719; therefore, a descendant of Crown Prince Sohyeon became Prince Yeollyeong's heir in the same year, and was later known as Yi Gong, Prince Sangwon (; 1715-1733) as of 1727. However, Prince Sangwon's birth family got involved in the Musin Revolt in 1728; as a relative to a "criminal", Sangwon himself died unmarried in 1733 and he had no issue, the adoption relationship was soon annulled in the same year as well. And so, King Yeongjo asked the officials to seek another heir for his late brother.
Later, among some of the king's closest relatives, Yeongjo was impressed by Yi Soosin, the son of Yi Chae; it was soon decided that Yi Soosin was to be the heir to Prince Yeollyeong and, as he was aged enough, he was eligible to receive the royal title, in 1734. In the same year, Yi Soosin's name was changed to "Yi Ohn" and received the title, Prince Nakcheon.
Around 1735 to 1737, Yeongjo decided to find a bride for his nephew, and daughters from some of the officials, including Kim Chi-man () and Seo Jong-su (; 1678–1744) from noble families, were chosen, but they both refused to have their daughter marry the prince; both of them were imprisoned by the order of Yeongjo and Lady Seo married Prince Nakcheon in 1737. Lady Seo was a great-great-granddaughter of Princess Jeongsin, the eldest daughter of King Seonjo; the couple had no children. After he married, Prince Nakcheon died suddenly in the same year, aged 16.
After his death, Prince Nakcheon was buried in the family graveyard at Geumcheon of Gyeonggi Province (now Siheung County, Gyeonggi Province), near to his adoptive parents and grandmother's burial.
Heir.
On October 7, 1747, King Yeongjo ordered Yi Cheol-hai (), a 7-great-grandson of Deokheung Daewongun (7th son of King Jungjong and the father of Seonjo) and the second son of Yi Hyeong-jong (), to be the heir to Prince Nakcheon under a new name and title, Yi Yeong, Prince Dalseon (; December 20, 1731 – January 16, 1749). During the process, the Grand Queen Dowager (Queen Inwon, the king's stepmother) commented that the adoptee would become her great-grandson and she hoped to choose another closer relative instead. The adoption ended shortly later, as Lady Seo treated poorly to his adopted son and daughter-in-law, eventually causing Prince Dalseon committed suicide by poisoning himself in 1749; after his death, the adoption relationship between Nakcheon and Dalseon was annulled in 1750.
As King Jeongjo succeeded to the throne in 1776, Prince Eunsin, the new king's late half-brother, was appointed to be the new heir to Prince Yeollyeong, but not as an heir to Prince Nakcheon. The status of Prince Nakcheon being the adopted son of Prince Yeollyeong was also annulled during Jeongjo's reign. In 1819, during the reign of Sunjo, some officials suggested making either Prince Eunsin or another relative to be the heir to Prince Nakcheon, but the proposal was not approved.
During the time of Korea under Japanese rule in 1940, the graves of Prince Nakcheon and his family were moved to Yesan County in South Chungcheong Province, as Keijō (now Seoul) was under a land consolidation.

Mary A. Monroe

Mary Ann Monroe (March 7, 1860 – September 11, 1953) was a prominent teacher and school administrator in Spokane, Washington, and an active figure in education across the state of Washington. She was the first woman to serve as president of the Washington Education Association and the first woman on the board of trustees at the State Normal School at Cheney. She ran unsuccessfully for the office of Washington Superintendent of Public Instruction in 1912, but was active in civic and state politics in the early 20th century.
Early life and education.
Monroe was born on March 7, 1860 in Newark, Ohio. She was born to mother Catherine Thyrer and father John Simpson. Her mother was from Germany, and her father, John Simpson, was from England. She had a sister.
Monroe received her education in a city normal school, and went to college at Denison University in Granville, Ohio, although she did not receive her degree from Denison. She completed her education degree at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. In 1889, Monroe came to Spokane, Washington, and soon after she began employment at the Lincoln School (a public elementary school) as a teacher.
Career.
Monroe began teaching at the Lincoln School in Spokane in 1889. The school at that time held classes in the basement of a Unitarian Church. The school was soon relocated to its own building, which she later described in a letter to a friend as a brick building with four classrooms on what is now Cowley Street. The school's location made her work more challenging—as Monroe explained in her letters, the building had no running water initially, and the absence of graded streets in the early 1890s made access to the school difficult: "The teachers and students waded through snow, mud, and water in rubber boots." Monroe taught at the school for several years before being promoted to service as the building's principal, a job she held at the Lincoln School from 1893 until 1928. Among the major challenges she faced as principal was leading the school through rebuilding from catastrophic fires in 1903 and 1926.
Monroe was also active beyond the confines of the Lincoln School, working for public education. She was involved in the Washington Education Association from its earliest days, and is recorded as a presenter at the association's state conference in 1898. In January 1905, she was appointed to the library committee for the Spokane city schools by then school board president Warren W. Tolman.
1912 campaign for State Superintendent.
In 1912, Monroe ran as the Democratic nominee for state school superintendent, advocating a policy of "progression and modern ideas." Despite her identification as a Democrat, one newspaper remarked on the existence of "a non-partisan club of women" that organized specifically to assist with her campaign, which included both Progressive and Republican women in the club's leadership. Monroe's platform aimed to make education more directly related to the everyday lives of students. Rural Washington schools, in Monroe's view, needed to focus on agriculture and domestic science for the future housewife, with "a closer relation between the farm and the school." For urban students, Monroe favored manual training departments, and school and home gardens. For all students, regardless of location, she advocated for citizenship education.
In the general election, Monroe placed third statewide with 72,916 votes—a relatively close loss in a three-way race against C.E. Beach, the Progressive nominee, who received 86,396 votes, and the winner, Republican nominee Josephine Corliss Preston, who received 96,756 votes.
Trustee.
On April 26, 1913, the "Colville Examiner" published appointments made by Governor Ernest Lister. The article announced Monroe as a "trustee [for the] Cheney normal school." She was the first woman to serve on the normal school's board of trustees.
When the normal school's main building was rebuilt following the 1912 fire, Monroe as chair of the board of trustees gave the opening address at the dedication of the new building (now Showalter Hall) on May 22, 1915. On February 4, 1916, Monroe was present at the dedication of another new building—the school's first dormitory—when it was named Monroe Hall in her honor. She was the guest of honor on the occasion, and was invited to kindle the first fire in the hall's main fireplace: she made some brief remarks about "the various ways in which a woman's residence hall could have a salutary influence on girls coming from many different environments." She fulfilled the same office on July 9, 1920, kindling the first fire at the campus's second dormitory, Senior Hall: she then remarked "It is the wish of the friends of the girls of Senior Hall that the fireplace may scatter its light, radiate its heat, and bring good cheer to future occupants of this beautiful home." Another of her public duties was handing diplomas to graduates at the commencement ceremony.
In addition to her duties as a trustee, Monroe visited with the students of the Normal School. In June 1918, she spent the weekend as a guest in Monroe Hall. Monroe was also a regular guest at senior class dinners. In 1924, all the trustees, including Monroe, were honored with a dinner. While visiting Ohio in the summer of 1921, Monroe purchased two vases to decorate Monroe Hall.
Political activism.
Monroe was active in public service and civic engagement throughout her life. She was the first woman teacher in Spokane to testify in court regarding the enforcement of the city's truancy law. In 1913, Monroe was elected as the incoming president of the Washington Education Association (WEA), while still remaining a school principal in the Spokane Public Schools; she was the first woman president of the WEA, and only the second woman in the United States to serve as president of a state educational association.
Monroe remained active in Democratic party politics after her 1912 run for State Superintendent. She was one of four women named as delegates to the 1916 Democratic National Convention that re-nominated Woodrow Wilson (Monroe was an at-large delegate). In 1920, Monroe was appointed to a "Democratic Platform Committee" for the Washington State Democratic Party, which was chaired by Preston M. Troy.
Later in life, Monroe served as an officer in the Episcopal Diocese of Spokane's Women's Auxiliary: she is listed as the president of that organization in 1931. She also served on Spokane's municipal parks board, chairing the recreation committee at one point: in that capacity, she assisted with the training of teachers facilitated by the Works Progress Administration in 1936.
Personal life.
Reports vary as to when Monroe married William Allison Monroe: in her obituary, it claims they were married in 1884, whereas William Allison Monroe's obituary claims they were married in 1886. The couple had no children. In 1889, they moved from Newark, Ohio, to Seattle, Washington, and shortly after the Great Fire on August 4, 1889, they moved to Spokane. William A. Monroe was a well-known engineer and accountant. Soon after they came to Spokane, he became a deputy city auditor, working with Theodore Reed. After about a decade and a half, he joined Winter, Parsons &amp; Boomer, railway contractors, quickly becoming a manager of that company, which built many railways, dams, and other projects throughout the western United States. He died of a stroke at the age of 79, on March 13, 1940, at Sacred Heart Hospital in Spokane.
According to the "Spokane Press", Monroe, when she was principal of the Lincoln School, woke up to a burglar in her home one evening. She screamed and frightened the burglar, who the "Press" noted was "probably more scared than she [was]": the police were called and nothing was reported stolen.
Monroe died at the age of 93 on September 11, 1953, at the Jane O'Brien Sanitarium in Spokane, from chronic myocardial degeneration. She is buried at Greenwood Memorial Terrace in Spokane.

Damas Bishop of Magnesia

Damas was Bishop of the church in Magnesia in August 117.
He is reputed to have gone out to meet Ignatius of Antioch as he was escorted by Roman Soldiers along the road to Smyrna. Irenius entrusted to him a letter to his church.
 That letter has gone on to become a statement of Christian doctrine.
In that letter Ignatius of Antioch exhorts The church in Magnesia to not treat him "too familiarly on account of his youth, but to yield all reverence to him" 
"and it becometh you also not to presume upon the youth of your bishop, but according to the power of God the Father to render unto him all reverence, even as I have learned that the holy presbyters also have not taken advantage of his outwardly youthful estate, but give place to him as to one prudent in God"
This event is recorded in Eucibius. So when he came to Smyrna, where Polycarp was, he wrote an epistle to the church of Ephesus, in which he mentions Onesimus, its pastor; and another to the church of Magnesia, situated upon the Mæander, in which he makes mention again of a bishop Damas; and finally one to the church of Tralles, whose bishop, he states, was at that time Polybius.

Cinnamomum malabatrum

Cinnamomum malabatrum, wild cinnamon, country cinnamon also known as malabathrum, is a tree in the family Lauraceae that is endemic to Western Ghats of India. It can grow up to tall. It has aromatic leaves that are used for culinary and medicinal purposes. It is thought to have been one of the major sources of the medicinal plant leaves known in classic and medieval times as malabathrum (or malobathrum). It is locally known as "Edana", "Therali" or "Vazhana in" Kerala.
Uses.
The bark is sometimes used for cooking, although it is regarded as inferior to true cinnamon or cassia. Thorough macroscopic and microscopic investigations revealed that "Cinnamomum malabatrum" is mixed with "Cinnamomum tamala" as an adulterant in 'Tamalapatra', a highly reputed commodity in drug and spice trade. It is often used in kumbilappam or chakka-ada, an authentic sweet from Kerala, infusing its characteristic flavor to the dumplings.
Etymology.
Malabar had been traditionally used to denote the west coast of Southern India that forms the present-day state of Kerala and adjoining areas. The word "mala" or "malaya" means "mountain" in the Tamil and Malayalam languages, as also in Sanskrit. The word "malabathrum" is thought to have been derived from the Sanskrit "tamālapattram" (तमालपत्त्रम्), literally meaning "dark-tree leaves".

Leonid Biberman

Leonid Mikhailovich Biberman (; 7 April 1915, Poti — 23 September 1998, Moscow) was a Soviet and Russian physicist and a Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1991). He was one of the founders of the Thermophysics research school in the Soviet Union.
Biography.
Leonid Mikhailovich Biberman graduated from Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI) in 1940, specializing in Electro-Vacuum technology. In January 1941 he entered the postgraduate course of Moscow Power Engineering Institute. His scientific advisor was Valentin Fabrikant.
He fought in Great Patriotic War from 1941 to 1945 in the rank of Technician-Lieutenant, and was the head of the workshop of a communications battalion.
In 1945, he was reinstated in the post-graduate course of Moscow Power Engineering Institute and began teaching part-time there at the Department of Physics. Since 1946, he had been a Consultant of the All-Union Electrotechnical Institute.
Candidate of Sciences (1946), Doctor of Science (1959).
In the second half of the 1950s, Leonid Biberman took on a complicated physicotechnical problem: the development of the theory of radiative heat transfer. In 1955–1957 Biberman managed to show in his papers that when a space vehicle moves through dense layers of the atmosphere, the shock wave radiation in front of the apparatus generates a significant, and at high velocities, the principal contribution to aerodynamic heating. The results of this research were used in calculations for the thermal insulation of Soviet space vehicles.
In 1966 he started working at Joint Institute for High Temperatures. He substantiated the establishment of a high-temperature research group, which became the basis of the Theoretical Division of the Institute of High Temperatures of the USSR Academy of Sciences. This scientific school was later named after him. He was a scientific advisor of more than 20 Doctors of Sciences.
He died on 23 September 1998 in Moscow and was buried at Vagankovo Cemetery.

Women's and Gender Education Center (Eastern Washington University)

The Women's and Gender Education Center at Eastern Washington University was established in 1977 as the EWU Women's Center, and has continued to serve students at EWU since that time. The center is part of the Women's and Gender Studies Program.
Creation of the Center.
Eastern Washington University's Women's and Gender Education Center, or WAGE, opened officially on October 5, 1977 in Monroe Hall on the Cheney campus. Then called the Women's Center, its first director was Dr. Pat Coontz. The Center was part of the Women's Program, which coordinated the activities of an academic program for Women's Studies with the Center's programming for Eastern Washington University students, faculty, staff, and the greater Cheney community. Pat Coontz also created the Women's Center to break the stigma of women being viewed in the role of wife and mother, and to create an empowering environment to be recognized as a powerful leader in her community.
History of the Center.
As the name of the Center suggests, its intention was to support research in women's studies. In addition to supporting scholarship, discussions, counseling, and lectures were on the agenda. In the student newspaper's "Faculty Forum" column on January 19, 1978, Pat Coontz shot down the "Women's Libber" stereotype, noting that extremist views were not characteristic of the majority of feminists. She then called out her male colleagues for contributing to a sexist campus culture. These colleagues, were "good union men, interested in a better future for everyone" yet referred to their "Farrah Fawcett-looking students" as "chicks" and "dolls." The Center's name has changed over time: originally the Women's Center from the fall of 1977 until about June 1989, it was renamed the EWU Women Studies Center in September 1989. It received its current name, the Women's and Gender Education Center, in the fall of 2017.
The main objective of the center is to provide an area for women and non-binary identities with resources and the opportunity to promote in-depth academic and scholarly research on issues relating to women and gender. Ultimately a main goal of the WAGE Center is to educate people about women's status, lend assistance in cases of discrimination, and support the strengthening of women's ideals.
Programs and activities.
Annually, the Women's &amp; Gender Studies Program hosts Contemporary Issues in Feminist Research presentation series in which faculty present research in their discipline from a feminist perspective.
The Women's Studies Challenge to Tradition was a four day conference, starting May 4, 1978 to May 7, 1978, that brought together members of the general public and scholars from the Northwest to discuss research and developments in women's studies. The keynote speaker for the symposium was Fanny Howe, who spoke on the need to reexamine curricula biased toward a male perspective. There were 15 panels and workshops that discussed different topics such as women under stress, women and work in a technological age, women and politics, history's lost achievements, women in the arts and sciences, the language of sexism, single parent families and the impact of feminism on the church.
In 1986 from October 17–19, Eastern hosted the Northwest Women's Studies Association Conference, featuring keynote speaker and contemporary feminist Nawal El-Saadawi.
The H.O.M.E. (Helping Ourselves Means Education) Program is a self-help network that provides resources for students who are typically low-income parents. H.O.M.E. connects students to a network of volunteer staff, faculty, and administrators.
On October 17–19, 1986, a conference was held and it dealt with the energy of women in building and giving birth to their communities on a local level, as well as nationally and internationally.
Programs offered in the spring quarter of 1977 were sexism in counseling, women in art, racism and sexism, and women and social reform.
Currently, The Women's and Gender Education Center offers a bi-annual leadership seminar to the students of Eastern Washington University. This one day seminar, including local community leaders, celebrates the successes and challenges of women in and around Spokane. This seminar allows ideas to bloom in a safe environment and vital connections are made. The WAGE Center continually connects women to resources within the University and out in the local area.

Plot.
Satoru Mikami is an ordinary 37-year-old corporate worker living in Tokyo. He is almost content with his monotonous life, despite the fact that he doesn't have a girlfriend. During a casual encounter with his colleague, an assailant pops out of nowhere and stabs him. While succumbing to his injuries, a mysterious voice echoes in his mind and recites a series of commands which he could not make sense of.
After regaining consciousness, Satoru discovers that he has been reincarnated as a Slime in an unfamiliar world. At the same time, he also acquires new-found skills, particularly the ability called "Predator," which allows him to devour anything and mimic its appearance and skills. He stumbles upon Veldora Tempest, a Catastrophe-level 'Storm Dragon', who was sealed for 300 years for reducing a town to ashes. Feeling sorry for him, Satoru befriends the dragon, promising to help him in destroying the seal. In return, Veldora bestows upon him the name Rimuru Tempest to grant him divine protection.
With his newfound powers and his wisdom, Rimuru gains the friendship and loyalty of the monsters inhabiting the Great Jura Forest, who accept him as their leader and together they found the nation of Tempest. As their new nation quickly grows in strength and influence, Rimuru and his subjects draw the attention of the nearby foreign powers, from monarchs and legendary heroes to demon lords, some seeking to become their allies, while others intend to just take advantage or destroy them completely for the sake of their plans.

Ängie

Angelina Dehn (born 22 March 1995), better known by her stage name Ängie, is a Swedish pop and trap-hop artist.
Early life and career.
Dehn was born in Stockholm and grew up in the town of Nynäshamn. She felt rejected by her friends after they learned of her first girlfriend. Dehn struggled with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and mental health disorders in her adolescence and even contemplated suicide. She found relief in cannabis, saying it helped her get through her depression and get to know herself better. In 2018 she admitted that she used to be a drug addict, but has since given up on drugs, although stated in 2016 that "Weed [cannabis] is not really a drug to me. It helps so many people, with like Parkinson’s, and if you feel like shit, or you’re suicidal, it can help you so much. That’s the reason why I started smoking. I had like so low self-esteem. I’ve got ADD, I’m borderline, so it really helped me focus and get to know myself." After snapchatting clips of herself rapping to Death Team, they offered to produce her first single. She worked as a bartender, nursery teacher and window fitter before her single started getting attention. She was signed to Rich Parents AB, a division of Universal Music AB and her debut EP "Suicidal Since 1995" was released in April 2018.
On 25 January 2019 she released as a single "IDGAF", described as "a bass heavy trap roller". It's the first song taken from Ängie's first studio album "Everything Is Fake", set to be released as the following single.
A joint EP between Ängie and producer Harrison First called "Each Other" was released on 14 June 2019. A music video for the track "Bambam" directed by Ängie herself and frequent collaborator Christopher Nilsson was released on 21 June 2019, being premiered via Gaffa. The lead single of "Heartburn", a joint album between Ängie and producer Tail Whip, a song called "Dust" was released on 22 November 2019 alongside its music video. The second single "Sad Sex" followed on 14 February 2020.
After the release of their collaborative EP, Ängie and Harrison First started working on a proper album. "Silver Sadness" served as the lead single and was released on 29 May 2020 along its music video, directed by Ängie herself and premiered a day before via Independent Music News. A music video for the track "Basic" was unveiled on the album's release date. It was directed by Jean-Luc Mwepu and co-directed by Ängie. The project called "Not Pushing Daisies" was released on 5 June 2020. "Heartburn", on the other side, was finally released on 1 January 2021.
Ängie performed at WorldPride in August 2021.
She has said some of her inspirations include Tyler, the Creator, Lana Del Rey, Grimes and Wiz Khalifa.
Personal life.
Dehn is bisexual. Her "Suicidal Since 1995" album has been described as "an “open diary” to detail her early life and struggles with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, family break-ups, suicidal thoughts, drugs, depression, and living as a bisexual in a “small-minded town”". Prior to her first song ("Smoke Weed Eat Pussy") she spent years experimenting with art and poetry and socialising with fellow creatives in coffee shops.
She was described in 2017 by journalist Harriet Gibsone as, "an emblem of the liberal-minded revolution that is thriving online among teenagers and people in their early 20s. She is socially motivated, serious about her social media “art” and as committed to getting high as she is to creating a sense of community among those living in small towns as she once did."
She supports the legalisation of cannabis. When asked in an interview in September 2016, "Is that a message you want to get across with your music? Legalise weed?" She responded "After girl power, yeah."

All Soul (Houston Person album)

All Soul is an album by saxophonist Houston Person which was recorded in 2005 and released on the HighNote label.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Tim Sendra states "The Texas tenor is one of the last men standing and 2005's "All Soul" shows he is standing as tall as ever. His gruff but inviting tone is steady and true, and a quick listen to the first track shows it hasn't dropped off at all ... Person as usual positively bleeds heart and soul on the ballads ... and romps through the up-tempo tracks". On All About Jazz, Greg Thomas noted "Someone once said that jazz is the sound of surprise. Tenor man Houston Person, best known for his work with the late singer Etta Jones, demonstrates this truism to a tee on All Soul, featuring ten compositions across a spectrum of jazz styles and eras ... By the time you finish listening, you'll be surprised and cheerful too". In JazzTimes, Owen Cordle wrote: "Person often punctuates his lines with a shout. Sometime he drenches his phrases in blues grease. And sometimes during a ballad a single bent note is all it takes for him to create a feeling of yearning. There’s a vocal quality to his playing, as if he’s singing the melody. All Soul is another good one from a master soul man".

Just Between Friends (album)

Just Between Friends is an album by saxophonist Houston Person and bassist Ron Carter recorded in 2005 and released on the HighNote label in 2008.
Reception.
The AllMusic review by Jeff Tamarkin said "Immediately, Houston Person's saxophone and Ron Carter's bass meld so fluidly and effortlessly -- and create such a complete picture -- that it's easy to forget that they are the only two musicians playing. Drums are not missed, nor are piano, horns, or anything else: Person and Carter's communication skills here, as on their previous outings together, are never in doubt; they're "always" in perfect sync. ... It's a collaboration in the truest sense, one in which emotion and the integrity of the material and arrangements trounce showboating". In JazzTimes, Steve Futterman stated "A palpable sense of intimacy, ease and near-telepathic intuition practically radiates from the disc ... Taking their time, savoring sturdy melodies and ingenious changes, allowing the sheer beauty of their respective tones to score major points, letting offhand virtuosity speak for itself, this duo practically luxuriates in generous music-making ... A swing-to-bop stylist now in the golden age of his artistic maturity, Person couldn't sound more relaxed, more willing to impart emotion through the warmth of his sound and the judicious construction of a perfectly devised phrase. Carter, for his part, carries the load of rhythm, harmony and unaccompanied soloist with a grace that will only surprise those that haven't thrilled to the best of his five-decades-long work". On All About Jazz, Terrel Kent Holmes observed "Houston Person plays sax with a tone whose smoothness and flawlessness complements Carter perfectly and their seamless interplay on "Just Between Friends" comes with familiarity and experience. Carter takes pleasantly meandering paths during his solos, enjoying the freedom that playing with a vet like Person affords".

Mir Ali Beg

Mir Ali Beg, or Mir Ali Bey was an Ottoman corsair (or buccaneer) in the late 16th century. Throughout the 1580s, Ali Beg reportedly led several expeditions in the attempt of the Ottoman Empire to contest the Portuguese control of the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and Indian Ocean down the Eastern Coast of Africa. He began this chain of expeditions in 1581, when he raided the Portuguese controlled city of Muscat, Oman, which appears to have been a resounding success. From there he would begin making his way down the Eastern African Coast, reaching the Kenyan city of Malindi by 1585. Ali Beg would return from his first expedition to the Swahili Coast in 1586 resoundingly successful, having "managed to secure the allegiance of every major Swahili port town except Malindi, to capture three fully laden Portuguese vessels, and to return safely to Mocha with some 150,000 cruzados of booty and nearly sixty Portuguese prisoners." However, the success of Mir Ali Beg's expeditions were widely kept a secret from the general Ottoman government, because three government members: Hasan Pasha, Kilich Ali Pasha, and Hazinedar Sinan Pasha, had hatched a conspiracy to gain more funding for naval expeditions by lying to the central government about an exaggerated Portuguese threat. Because news of Ali Beg's success would suggest that they were already in control of the sea, and thus would need no new funding, they kept it to themselves. However, this would come back to haunt them as in 1588 the Swahili people would arrive in Yemen requesting aid from the Portuguese fleet, and Hasan Pasha would have no credibility on which to ask for government funding or assistance, forcing him to send Mir Ali Beg back with just his same small fleet of five ships and 300 men. This would ultimately cost Ali Beg and the Ottomans, with his fleet being defeated in 1589 in Mombasa not only by the Portuguese but also a surprise third faction of supposed Zimba cannibals that ambushed them during battle. Mir Ali Beg would surrender to the Portuguese fleet and be taken captive along with much of his crew. He would then be sent to Goa and later Lisbon where he would convert to Christianity and live for the remainder of his life.
First voyage to the Swahili coast.
In 1583, Hasan Pasha exaggerated the significance of the arrest of a Spanish spy, and warned the Sultan that the Ottoman defenses in the Indian Ocean were not adequate to ward off a Portuguese invasion. In response, Sultan Murad III sent 2 galleots from Suez to Yemen in order to aid in defense. However, instead of using the ships for defense, Hasan Pasha gave them to Mir Ali Beg and sent the fleet to raid the Portuguese controlled Swahili coast, but also to establish connections with the local Muslim population and choose the location of a new Ottoman naval base for future raids and the eventual conquest of the Swahili coast. however, on their way out of Yemen, one of the galleots had to turn back. Mir Ali thus began his journey to the Swahili coast with a single galleot and 80 men.
The Portuguese were so unpopular among the local people that upon arriving in Mogadishu and explaining why he was visiting, the people of Mogadishu immediately declared allegiance to Murad III, contributed funding and 20 armed coastal ships as an escort to the expedition. Mir Ali received similarly enthusiastic support from his visits of other towns along the coast.
The Portuguese were unprepared for Mir Ali Beg's arrival. Ruy Lopes Salgado, the captain responsible for defending the Swahili coast, chose to hide in Malindi rather than attempt to stop the privateer. Mir Ali Beg had free rein of the coast. Shortly thereafter, he captured a merchant ship from Diu without a fight, and the people of Lamu turned over Captain-Major Roque de Brito and his warship, the crew of which he promptly replaced with Muslim volunteers, and used to capture another Portuguese ship.
Mir Ali and his fleet spent the next month gaining support from the local Muslim people along the coast, and returned to Mocha with a fleet of 24 ships, plunder worth 150,000 gold cruzados (Portuguese currency), and 60 Portuguese captives.
Battle of Mombasa.
In the Spring of 1589, Mir Ali Beg arrived in Mombasa to prepare for the oncoming Portuguese attack. Because of his previous successful expedition to Mombasa, the locals were welcoming of him and his fleet and supported them in the preparations for the battle. Although Ali Beg only had five galleots and approximately 300 men under his control to combat the strong Portuguese fleet, he was also given a large amount of artillery to use on land. With the assistance of the locals, in just a few weeks he prepared his defense of the harbor which included a tower with artillery mounts, as well as his own fleet.
Though this was a strong defensive position for Mir Ali Beg, it was only so to an invasion from the sea. And while this was exactly what the Portuguese had planned to do, no one could have accounted for the surprise third party that ultimately decided the battle. Record says that on the day of the battle, up to 20,000 members of a supposed cannibal Zimba tribe ambushed Ali Beg's men and the town of Mombasa causing the battle to essentially be over by the time the Portuguese, led by commander Tomé De Souza Coutinho, arrived to the harbor. While the Ottomans would briefly attempt to fire at the Portuguese, they were so overwhelmed by the Zimba on land that they could do little to resist the Portuguese from simply overpowering the remainder of their fortifications. Mir Ali Beg would seek refuge inland for a couple of days while the Portuguese remained hesitant to leave the harbor, but that would change when the Zimba chief talked to the Portuguese commander and declared an alliance, prompting De Souza Coutinho to immediately head to capture Ali Beg and his men. The Zimba were still aiming to kill the Ottomans and Mombasans, and chased Ali Beg and his men all the way to the shore until he plunged into the sea to be taken captive by the Portuguese along with a small number of his men and Mombasans. Ali Beg appeared relieved to be captured by the Portuguese as opposed to the Zimba, saying, "I do not lament my adverse fortune, for such is the nature of war, and I would much rather be a captive of the Christians, as I was once before in Spain, than food for the barbarous and inhuman Zimba.”
After his defeat and subsequent capture in March 1589, Mir Ali Beg was taken to Lisbon where he would convert to Christianity and change his name to Francisco Julião, and live out his days as a prisoner.
Identity of the "Zimba".
The identity of Zimba remains unknown. Even their name is uncertain, as the name is attributed to them by the Portuguese (indeed it was a term often ascribed to a variety of bellicose groups during the period). Allegedly they were a cannibal tribe, but it has also been suggested this may have just been an embellishment by Europeans, who tended to ascribe cannibalistic tendencies to African tribes during this time period. It has been suggested they could have been anything from a migrating Maravi warriors to a mercenary army hired by discontented Mombasans or perhaps a local group that preferred Portuguese influence to that of Ottoman interlopers.
The elusive identity of the group has caused some historians to even go so far as to suggest they were a fiction created by Portuguese writers. However Giancarlo Casale argues that this is a mistaken viewpoint, arguing that while the identity of the Zimba is unknown, it is undeniable that some third party did show up in force at the battle. Casale argues that if they were fictional, it is not clear why the Portuguese would make them up; the Ottomans' conflicts with Christendom made them an opponent "par excellence" for any Portuguese noble at the time and Portugal wanted to prove her actions in the Indian Ocean against the Ottoman Empire were equal to those of any European state in the Mediterranean. Portuguese chroniclers were more likely to exaggerate their countrymen's role, rather than downplay it. Thus Casale argues that it makes no sense for the Portuguese to invent a fictional force that suddenly intervenes in the conflict at a critical moment and deprives the Portuguese forces of credit for their victory. Thus in Casale's view, while the identity and even name of the Zimba may be uncertain, it is highly likely that some third party did intervene during the battle.
Legacy.
Mir Ali Beg was a prominent figure in the Ottoman history of expansion in the Indian Ocean. His early voyages marked some of the first contentions to Portuguese control of the area by the Ottoman Empire, and his defeat at Mombasa in 1589 would mark the end of the Ottomans attempts to contest to the Portuguese the Indian Ocean for the rest of their history.

IGF2 antisense RNA

IGF2 antisense RNA is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IGF2-AS gene.
Function.
This gene is expressed in antisense to the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene and is imprinted and paternally expressed. It is thought to be non-coding because the putative protein is not conserved and translation is predicted to trigger nonsense mediated decay (NMD). Transcripts from this gene are produced in tumors and may function to suppress cell growth. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2015].

Steelville, Pennsylvania

Steelville is an unincorporated community in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. According to the 2016 census, the town has not been included in past census counts because the town is so small. It lies next to the Octoraro Creek: the border line between Lancaster County and Chester County.
History.
Steelville occupies land adjacent to Atglen, Pennsylvania which used to be wilderness. Native Americans roamed the land during this time, and primarily used trails such as the Great Minquas Path to access trade routes and trade with the English settlers. In 1875 the borough of Atglen was established and now includes Steelville. The town is also a member of West Fallowfield Township that was developed in 1878.
A few organized religious groups began developing in the surrounding area including the Presbyterians. Presbyterian churches and Quaker meeting houses began to form. A few families from these religious groups formed the town of Steelville, as the English began to settle most of what is now the East Coast, United States. One of these families was the family of William Steele who settled in Steelville in 1750. He resided here in 1814 where he had a son, Franklin Steele.
Geography.
Steelville is located at (latitude, longitude). It is generally contained within the perimeter of Bailey's Crossroads Road, Schoff Road, and Steelville Road. The elevation in Steelville is above sea level.

Reception.
The AllMusic review by Matt Collar said ""Chemistry" is a deceptively simple conceit; just two jazz journeymen playing conversational duets on well-known jazz songs. At face value, that is certainly what you get. The deception enters into the equation with just how masterful and nuanced Person and Carter are in each song ... Ultimately, "Chemistry" is a lovely, heartfelt album of well-loved standards imbued with the duo's decades of experience". In JazzTimes, Mac Randall stated "What you get is pretty much what you’d expect: A menu of standards, served with reliable skill and unpretentious style, provides the setting for the latest installment of an ongoing, wide-ranging chat between old friends".

Noémi Raymond

Noémi Pernessin Raymond (also spelled Noemi; June 23, 1889 – August 19, 1980) was a French-born American artist and designer who spent much of her career in Japan. Her work included painting, sculpture, graphic design and illustration, furniture, rug and textile design as well as interior design.
Biography.
Born in Cannes, France, Raymond moved to New York with her family around age 12. She graduated from Columbia University where she studied under John Dewey and Arthur Wesley Dow who introduced her to Japanese art and design. She later studied painting at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris. 
As World War I threatened, Raymond returned to America. On the voyage in August, 1914, she met Czech-born Antonin Raymond who became her design partner and husband. They married in NYC on December 13, 1914. It was her art-world connections which led to her and Antonin working for Frank Lloyd Wright from May-December, 1916. 
Noémi and Antonin worked with Wright at Taliesin and, after Antonin was discharged from the US army at the end of WWI, accompanied Wright to Japan in 1919 to work on the design of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. After leaving the Imperial Hotel project in 1921, Noémi and her husband remained and worked in Japan until 1938; they returned again after World War II, working in Japan from 1947 or 1948 to 1973. 
Designs.
Together Noémi and her husband worked together on over 500 structures in Japan, India, South East Asia, Europe and the United States, including houses, schools, factories, embassies, churches, etc. Committed modernists, their style combined modern European design with international folk craft traditions. She and Antonin gained recognition as one of the earliest practitioners of the International Style in Asia. 
Trained as an artists/designer, Raymond's interest in 3-D design grew as she worked with her architect husband. In 1916, while working with Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesen, she realized the importance that furnishings played in manipulating space along with knitting together structures. Noémi went on to design the interiors of many of Antonin’s architectural projects. 
While living in Japan in the 1920s, Raymond learned about Japanese craft working as an export broker for various Japanese goods such as lacquerware, ceramics, baskets, and textiles. She worked with Mita Heibonji who taught her the techniques of wood block printing and sumi-e calligraphy as well as an appreciation for folk art, which complemented the Raymonds interest in Japanese rural farmhouse ("minka").
Work in Japan.
Noémi Raymond's textile design shows the influence of Japanese block-print textiles of the 1930s. She and her husband observed in 1935: "The doing away with all but essentials, or discipline, is the basis of Japanese charm... All is the direct result of a necessity, be it material or spiritual."
Furniture design earned Noémi Raymond praise from her contemporaries. Tasked with blending East and West in a minka-inspired living room by golf course designer Akaboshi Shiro, the artist created "tubular metal chairs" upholstered to mimic "traditional Japanese weaving." Noémi Raymond's insight applied to artistic trends as much as it did to daily life, evident by her inclusion of strategically placed mirrors in the Akaboshi home which allowed his wife to monitor the children from her bedroom.

Charles Vince (Baptist)

Charles Vince (1823–1874) was a noted and popular Baptist minister in Birmingham, England, at the Graham Street chapel from 1852 to 1874. He was one of the religious leaders developing Birmingham's Civic Gospel, with his predecessor at the chapel George Dawson, and Henry William Crosskey.
Life.
Vince was born in Farnham, Surrey, into a Congregationalist background: his father was a carpenter and builder. He attended a local school, run by a nephew of William Cobbett, became an apprentice to Mason &amp; Jackson, the firm for which his father worked, and joined the local Mechanics' Institute. After a Baptist conversion, he entered Stepney College in 1848. He was then assigned to the Mount Zion Chapel, in Graham Street, Birmingham. He has been described as a "charismatic preacher".
As a figure of the Birmingham "civic renaissance" (or "civic gospel"), a movement promoted by Dawson's supporters, Vince spoke for causes including the Reform League, the National Education League, and the Liberal Association. He was also personally popular as a minister. He defended the radicalism of George Edmonds in an 1868 funeral sermon for him.
Vince was an influential participant in Birmingham's social institutions, and a member of Birmingham's first school board. He died on 22 October 1874, at age 51, and was buried at Key Hill Cemetery, Hockley.
Family.
Vince left a widow and seven children. They included Charles Anthony Vince (born 1855), an academic, head of Mill Hill School, Liberal Unionist and local historian of Birmingham; and James Herbert Vince. The fourth son, W. B. Vince, was a solicitor and worked for the "Birmingham Post" before dying young.

Averell Smith

Averell Smith (born November 18, 1958) is an American political adviser who has worked mainly for Democratic Party candidates and initiatives. He has worked on many state and national campaigns, either independently or as part of a consulting firm which he co-founded in 1997.
Early life and education.
Named after former New York governor and U.S. ambassador Averell Harriman, Smith was introduced to politics at a young age, working on his father Arlo Smith’s campaign for District Attorney of San Francisco. He campaigned for George McGovern for president in 1972 at age 13. His first job was at a legal processor on Taylor and Market Streets in San Francisco, before working as a consultant for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the 1980s.
Career.
Beginning in 1988, Smith began to focus his political work on opposition research, including work for Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago and Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles. He used the same methods to identify potential vulnerabilities of his own clients, for example in Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign. He unearthed a minor billing scandal in the Department of Water and Power involving incumbent Mayor James Hahn that helped his client Antonio Villaraigosa win the election. and provided members of the press with the roster of the Canadian football team the Hamilton Tiger-Cats after it was reported that Los Angeles City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo had falsely claimed to play for them, when Delgadillo was running against Smith's client Jerry Brown in the 2006 Democratic primary.
Campaigns he has worked on include those of Doug Wilder (1989), Senator Patty Murray (1992), Senator Dianne Feinstein (1992), Senator Kent Conrad (1993), Congressman Richard Gephardt (1994-2002), California Governor Gray Davis (1998, 2002), Senator Barbara Boxer (1992-2010) and Howard Dean for President (2004). In 2008,
Smith led Senator Hillary Clinton's 9-point victory in California's Democratic primary by identifying key demographic groups like Latino voters and working women and concentrating his efforts on mail-in and other early voters. He oversaw the campaign in Texas, achieving a second surprising victory.
Smith directed Antonio Villaraigosa’s winning underdog Los Angeles Mayoral campaign in 2005 and Jerry Brown’s winning campaign for CA Attorney General 2006. He was State Director for Senator Hillary Clinton’s campaigns in CA, TX and NC in the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary. In 2010 he was instrumental in San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris’s winning bid for California Attorney General and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom’s successful campaign for California Lt. Governor. He ran Ed Lee’s mayoral reelection campaign. After successfully contributing to the passing of Governor Jerry Brown's landmark tax legislation Proposition 30 in 2012, Smith was hired by Lenore Anderson, executive director of Californians for Safety and Justice and chair of the Proposition 47 campaign, and that measure succeeded at the polls as well. 
Activism.
Smith and his wife Laura Talmus started Beyond Differences, a non-profit based in San Rafael, California to honor their daughter Lili Smith, who died in 2009 from complications due to Apert syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that causes facial and cranial disfiguration and which consequently caused her to suffer from feelings of social isolation. The organization endeavors to combat social isolation in young teens, by encouraging students to be aware of the possible social isolation of their peers, and to interact with them and draw them into their social circles.

7 (Beach House album)

7 is the seventh studio album by American dream pop band Beach House, released on May 11, 2018, through Sub Pop. It follows the "B-Sides and Rarities" compilation album released in 2017, which served as a proverbial "cleaning out the closet" to pave the way for a new creative process.
The album saw the group departing from longtime producer Chris Coady and instead collaborating with Sonic Boom, whilst not having a producer "in the traditional sense". The recording of the album lasted over eleven months, as opposed to the speedy process of previous efforts, beginning in the duo's home studio in Baltimore and finishing at Carriage House and Palmetto Studio. "7" received acclaim from music critics, who praised the adventurous nature of the record and the consistency of the band, with some calling it the duo's best album to date.
Five singles were released from the album: "Lemon Glow", "Dive", "Dark Spring", "Black Car", and "Lose Your Smile".
Recording.
Unlike with previous records, Beach House took their time with the recording process of "7". Instead of one long studio session, they recorded when inspired by batches of songs, which resulted in five mini-sessions over the course of eleven months throughout 2017. All of the songs on the album began in the duo's home studio in Baltimore called Apple Orchard Studios, and were finished at Carriage House in Stamford, CT, with "Lose Your Smile" and "Woo" being recorded at Palmetto Studio in Los Angeles. The band stated that their goal throughout the recording process of the album was "rebirth and rejuvenation," continuing: "We wanted to rethink old methods and shed some self-imposed limitations. In the past, we often limited our writing to parts that we could perform live. On "7", we decided to follow whatever came naturally. As a result, there are some songs with no guitar, and some without keyboard. There are songs with layers and production that we could never recreate live, and that is exciting to us. Basically, we let our creative moods, instead of instrumentation, dictate the album's feel."
The band also stated that "7" did not have a producer in the traditional sense, which let the ideas drive the creativity and not any one person's creative process. The band's touring drummer since 2016, James Barone, played on the entire record. They also worked with Peter Kember, known by the stage name Sonic Boom, who helped "in the shedding of conventions and in helping to keep the songs alive, fresh and protected from the destructive forces of recording studio over-production/over-perfection."
Themes and influences.
Thematically, "7" often deals with "the beauty that arises in dealing with darkness; the empathy and love that grows from collective trauma; the place one reaches when they accept rather than deny." The album's title itself simply represents it being the duo's seventh studio album, saying they "hoped its simplicity would encourage people to look inside. No title using words that we could find felt like an appropriate summation of the album," although they later mentioned that the number 7 represents some interesting connections in numerology, which further inspired them in naming the album as such.
Legrand described the album's sound as a natural progression and a product of her maturing as an artist, saying, "There were a lot of new and different things that went into making this record. But I think that the way that we wrote, and how we recorded while we wrote, really increased the speed of capturing ideas and gave us a lot more freedom than previous records... I think every time you do something, you become more adept at it. You sort of know better and don't get fooled the same way you got fooled when you were younger."
The band cited the "societal insanity" during 2016 and 2017 as a deep influence on the creation of the record, elaborating: "there is quite a bit of chaos happening in these songs, and a pervasive dark field that we had little control over. The discussions surrounding women's issues were a constant source of inspiration and questioning. The energy, lyrics and moods of much of this record grew from ruminations on the roles, pressures and conditions that our society places on women, past and present. The twisted double edge of glamour, with its perils and perfect moments, was an endless source."
Release and promotion.
The band released "Lemon Glow" on February 15, 2018, and announced it as the lead single from the then-unannounced album, which they stated would be released "later this spring". They released a second single, "Dive", on March 7, and shared a pre-order of the album, revealing its title, cover art, track listing and release date. They released "Dark Spring" as the third single on April 2 alongside a music video directed by Zia Anger, and "Black Car" was released as the fourth single on May 2, with a music video directed by Legrand's brother, Alistair Legrand, being released on June 18.
Sub Pop customers who pre-ordered "7" were given access to an exclusive stream of the album which occurred on April 27, two weeks prior to the release of the album, via Sub Pop's website. The album was officially released on CD, vinyl, cassette, digital download and streaming services on May 11, 2018, through Sub Pop worldwide, with the exception of Europe and Australia/New Zealand, where it was released through Bella Union and Mistletone, respectively. An animated album visualizer directed by San Charoenchai was uploaded to the band's YouTube channel upon the album's release, with each song being accompanied by psychedelic animations in black and white.
Beach House performed a live in-studio session on KCRW in Los Angeles on May 15, and were the musical guests on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on May 16, with a late night TV performance of "Drunk in LA".
The band headed on a North American and European tour in support of the album, beginning in Chattanooga, Tennessee on April 30, 2018. They later announced Australian tour dates, which include shows between February and March 2019.
On October 23, 2018, the band released a limited edition 7-inch vinyl of "Lose Your Smile" from "7" as the A-side and a new track from the recording sessions of "7" titled "Alien" as the B-side. The vinyl was originally sold on the band's European tour in dates from September to October. In addition, "Alien" was released as a standalone single to digital download and streaming services.
Critical reception.
At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, "7" received an average score of 80, based on 29 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews". In her review for "The Independent", Roisin O'Connor wrote, "Instead of limiting themselves, Beach House are finally embracing all of their creative moments, which have inevitably challenged them to become better artists." "The Line of Best Fit"s Chris Taylor stated that "7" is "as much of a reinvention as we're likely to get from Beach House but even those small steps to the left offer up yet another captivating record," and finished his review saying, "By this point, we really should just stop worrying about when Beach House are going to go stale because it's still nowhere near happening. It's still a pleasure to be lost in their world." Writing for "Stereogum", Gabriela Tully Claymore called "7" the duo's "boldest album yet". Eugenie Johnson of "The Skinny" wrote, "While they may not have completely achieved seventh heaven here, "7" is still a solid first step heralding Beach House's next phase."
"Rolling Stone"s Simon Vozick-Levinson called "7" "a radical blast of psychedelic pop bliss," saying "These are big songs, full of wonder, and Beach House know it. Seven albums in, they're at the start of something new." Jayson Greene of "Pitchfork" praised the album, writing "Beach House remain masters of the indefinable and their seventh album is their heaviest and most immersive-sounding of their career." AllMusic critic Heather Phares wrote, "Throughout "7", Beach House feel more concerned with capturing moments fully rather than conforming to notions of what a cohesive album is. That these songs sound like they came from different albums is ultimately more refreshing than disorienting, and the excitement that courses through each track is palpable." David Sackllah of "Consequence of Sound" said, ""7" finds the band taking risks and unlearning the parameters they had set for themselves to craft their most adventurous record yet," concluding: "By retooling their sound and shaking off any complacency that may have settled in, Beach House make their claim as one of the preeminent indie rock bands of the decade." Leah Greenblatt of "Entertainment Weekly" said ""7"s artful wooziness is hardly new, but for Beach House, it feels like home." Frank Guan of "Vulture" called "7" the duo's best album yet, writing "the darkness and directness of its sound, combined with Legrand's customary sibylline vocals, add up to something welcome and unprecedented in the Beach House catalogue — their best album in an already impressive set."
Kelsey J. Waite of "The A.V. Club" wrote, "With "7", Legrand and Scally have gotten freer themselves. This is the sound of a band that knows itself extremely well and yet, in seeking outside perspectives and embracing imperfection, has discovered a whole new level to explore. If this album feels like an alternate-reality Beach House, it's because Legrand and Scally have altered their reality." "Tiny Mix Tapes" Matthew Neale gave "7" a perfect score and called it the duo's greatest album. "Clash" lauded the record, writing: "The Baltimore duo have somehow gifted us their masterpiece, and though the rain outside has now stopped, new heavens have opened." Joe Goggins of "Drowned in Sound" said that "7" is "a record that gets closer to the band's self-imposed boundaries than they ever have before without really threatening to break them down." "Flood Magazine"s Alex Swhear praised the record's "expansive, almost oceanic aura."

Freshwater-class ferry

The "Freshwater" class is a class of ferry operating the Manly ferry service between Circular Quay and Manly on Sydney Harbour. The ferries are owned by the Government of New South Wales and operated by Transdev Sydney Ferries under the government's Sydney Ferries brand.
History.
The need for new ferries on the Manly-Circular Quay service was identified during the mid-1970s, during which time the service was characterised by deteriorating quality and low patronage.
Decline of the Manly ferries.
Prior to 1971, the ferry services on the Manly-Circular Quay route were operated by the Port Jackson &amp; Manly Steamship Company. In that year, the company posted a modest profit of $112,000. Patronage was approaching all-time lows, but the growth prospect for ferry services was considered strong. In November 1971, the company attracted a $1.5 million takeover bid from diversified transport company Brambles Industries. The initial bid was rejected, but a later offer of $2.1 million was accepted.
When Brambles took over, the Manly fleet consisted of four ferries: "South Steyne, North Head, Bellubera" and "Baragoola", plus hydrofoils "Manly", "Fairlight" and "Dee Why". Almost immediately, the hydrofoils were sold to Waltons Finance and leased back. The four ferries were all ageing and expensive to maintain, and it soon became evident that Brambles intended to close the service or sell the ships to the State Government at the earliest opportunity. Fare increases and service suspensions followed. The "Bellubera" was withdrawn from service on 14 December 1973; the "Baragoola" was to follow early the next year. Public outrage and fears that the service would be suspended entirely led to the government resuming responsibility for the operation of the ferries in February 1974.
Concerns about the on-going serviceability of the existing vessels led to a decision to modify the design of the "Lady Wakehurst" and "Lady Northcott", then under construction for use on the inner harbour routes, so that they could be used as relief boats on the Manly run. On 27 August 1974 the public timetable was reduced to only require two ships. The decision to modify the two Lady Class vessels proved fortuitous; as both the North Head and the Baragoola had to be sent for major overhauls, and the smaller ferries acted as relief ships while these works were carried out.
During the naming ceremony for the "Lady Northcott" on 11 February 1975, then Liberal Minister for Transport Wal Fife announced that two new ferries would be introduced to the Manly service within three years.
The Burness Corlett report.
A study by maritime consultants Burness Corlett Australia was released in July 1976. It investigated the requirements of new vessels to replace the "North Head" and "Baragoola" by 1978. Various configurations were considered, including conventional monohull, catamaran, hovercraft and hydrofoil. Planing ferries of both single and twin-hull configuration were rejected, as such a configuration cannot be double-ended and therefore would have required berthing stern-first. Hydrofoils were also rejected from consideration due to excessive cost and limited passenger capacity. Two options were selected for detailed investigation: monohull and twin-hull, both double-ended and having 1,200 passengers capacity.
Detailed designs and blueprints were prepared for both options. The study recommended the selection of the twin-hull due to the higher service frequency achievable (due to the twin-hull's faster speed of 18 knots versus 14.5 knots), however the study noted that other than this, there was relatively little difference between the options. The twin-hull was designed with dimensions of length, beam, and draft, while the monohull design was length, beam, and draft. The wider beam of the twin-hull design would exceed the limits of the existing wharves at Circular Quay, and necessitate a reconfiguration of the wharves if selected. Burness Corlett were confident that the twin-hull option was the superior choice, due to service speed and stability through Sydney Heads, and so no model tests were performed for the monohull design.
Burness Corlett predicted that either design would take approximately 21 months to construct, and that if the new ferries were to be introduced in 1978 as planned, an aggressive construction program would have to begin immediately, with tenders to be called no later than April 1976 (the report was not even released until three months after this date).
New ferries announced.
After a change of government at the 1976 election, the new Labor government's Transport Minister Peter Cox announced that tenders would be called for the construction of a new "super ferry" in line with the results of the engineering study, to carry up to 1,200 passengers at speeds of .
On 9 January 1978, the traditional three-ship Manly Ferry timetable was reintroduced. The service was operated with the Baragoola (1922), North Head (1913) and either the Lady Wakehurst or Lady Northcott. However, the modified Lady class ships were not good substitutes for the two older vessels, as the newer Lady ferries were too small and too slow for the Manly service. Particularly the Lady class ships were barely able to keep to the published timetable in peak hours. Following the return of the Labor Government at the State Election on 7 Oct 1978, the Labor Party's Alan Stewart became the Member for Manly. This provided a fresh political impetus for the State Labor administration to order the new Manly ferries.
Steelwork for "Freshwater" was laid down at the State Dockyard on 31 October 1980. Strike actions delayed completion until June 1982. The ferry terminals at Circular Quay and Manly were substantially modified to accommodate the larger ferries, including the installation of wide height-adjustable two-level hydraulic ramps. Additionally a new bus-interchange was built in the wharf forecourt at Manly.
Retirement 2021-2023.
There are plans to replace the Freshwater class ferries with 3 new Emerald class catamaran ferries in 2021. No decision has been made as yet on the future of the Freshwater Ferries.
In November 2020, the Minister for Transport announced that when the new ferries are put into operation, "Collaroy" would be retained in service until at least 2023 for weekend operation. On 14 January 2021 it was announced that the "Freshwater" will also be retained for future services. The "Narrabeen" and "Queenscliff" are expected to retire in the middle of 2021 when the new Emerald Class vessels begin operating.
Vessels.
Freshwater.
MV "Freshwater" is the lead ship of the four Freshwater class ferries. It is named after Freshwater Beach on Sydney's Northern Beaches. It was launched on 27 March 1982 by Olive Cox and commissioned by her husband, Minister for Transport Peter Cox, on 18 December 1982.
The three-month old ferry ran aground at Manly Cove in March 1983 after overshooting the wharf following a computer failure. On 30 March 1985, "Freshwater" was hijacked by a man who threatened to shoot passengers unless the captain piloted the ferry beyond Sydney Heads into the ocean. The hijacker was subdued after a police officer boarded the vessel and fired three warning shots. It turned out that the man, a New Zealander, had not been carrying a gun, but an empty vodka bottle (the second of two that he had consumed before boarding the vessel) concealed under his jacket. After a short jail sentence, the man returned to New Zealand in January 1986 by stowing away on the "Oriana", for which he was also fined.
Queenscliff.
MV "Queenscliff" is the second of the four Freshwater class ferries to enter service. It is named after Queenscliff Beach on Sydney's Northern Beaches.
Narrabeen.
MV "Narrabeen" is the third of the four Freshwater class ferries to enter service. It is named after Narrabeen Beach on Sydney's Northern Beaches. 
She is the third Manly ferry to be called "Narrabeen". "Narrabeen" (I) was an 1886-built iron paddle-steamer that was hulked in 1917. "Narrabeen" (II) was built in 1921 and was the last of the Manly cargo ferries. She was sold out of the Manly run in 1928 and wrecked in 1958. 
Collaroy.
MV "Collaroy" is the final Freshwater class ferry to enter service. It is named after Collaroy Beach on Sydney's Northern Beaches.
"Collaroy" differed from its classmates in having been equipped with underwater stabilisers and enhanced radar for use on ocean cruises. The control systems were upgraded to match that being fitted during overhauls of the other Freshwater class.
When Sydney hosted the 2000 Summer Olympics, "Collaroy" was the vessel used to carry the Olympic Flame across Sydney Harbour. In February 2001, "Collaroy" ran aground on Manly Point, putting the ferry out of service for several months and costing $2 million to repair.

Crown Prince Uiso

Crown Prince Uiso (; 27 September 1750 - 17 April 1752) or Crown Prince Successor Uiso (), personal name Yi Jeong or Lee Jeong () was a Joseon Crown Prince as the son of Crown Prince Sado and Crown Princess Consort Hyegyeong and was third in line of succession to the throne to King Yeongjo. He was the older brother of King Jeongjo. His Chinese name was Changheung ().
Biography.
His mother, Lady Hyegyeong, of Pungsan was from a famous royal family line. His maternal grandfather was Hong Bong-han, whose younger brother was Hong In-han, a minister and later Prime Minister of that time.
He was the first grandson of the 21st King Yeongjo of Joseon and his father, Crown Prince Sado, was the illegitimate second son of King Yeongjo. King Yeongjo's first son, Crown Prince Hyojang, died at the age of 10, leaving Crown Prince Sado as King Yeongjo's only male descendant. King Yeongjo hoped for another son but instead bore only daughters.
Uiso's father Crown Prince Sado had a severe mental illness and was often at odds with his father, King Yeongjo. Crown Prince Sado favoured the political party Soron, while King Yeongjo supported the ruling party Noron. Later King Yeongjo had his son, Crown Prince Sado, executed by locking him in a rice chest and starving him.
On September 27, 1750 he was born Changgyeong Palace Gyeongchun Hall, in Hanseong. King Yeongjo expected great things from him. On May 13, 1751 King Yeongjo declared him the political heir.
In November 1751, his aunt Lady Hyeonbin died, then soon after on 17 April 1752, Crown Prince Uiso died Tongmyongjeon. His grandfather, King Yeongjo took the deaths hard and severed from psychological trauma for some time.
He was given a state funeral of Joseons, from special instructions of King Yeongjo. His body was buried to the south of Mt. Ahnhyon (안현 鞍峴), Bugahyeon-dong in Hanseong. King Yeongjo named his grave Uiso grave and wrote the epitaphs, erecting a tombstone.
In 1870, his grave name was Uiryong Park (의령원 懿寧園). On June 7, 1949, his grave was moved to Wondang in Goyang.

It was proclaimed on 8 March 1973 as a conservation park under the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972" in respect to sections 154, 227 and 228. On 24 April 1986, Section 186 of the Hundred of Smith was added to the conservation park by proclamation. Both proclamations included the requirement for the South Eastern Drainage Board to have “having full, free and unrestricted right and liberty” to enter the conservation park to carry out duties and functions described in the "South Eastern Drainage Act 1931". It was proclaimed because of “its fine stand of river red gums,” however the land continued to be grazed until 1978 due to the existence of a lease over the land. As of 2016, it covered an area of .
In 1980, the conservation park's listing on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate argued it to be significant for the following reasons:The Park represents the only large stand of River Red Gum in the vicinity. Being a long narrow Park it forms an important corridor of habitat for nomadic and migratory birds such as honeyeaters, notably the uncommon blackchinned honeyeater and parrots. The Park also contains small areas of swampy habitat.
In February 1983, the southern half of the conservation park was burnt during the Ash Wednesday bushfires.
In 1990, the conservation park was described as "an interdunal plain of calcarenite with sandy, mottled yellow duplex soils" covered with vegetation consisting of "a river red gun open forest/woodland community" which gradually changes into a brown stringybark woodland at its western boundary. The conservation park is the only part of the Reedy Creek watercourse which "ensures regeneration of the river red gums" because the rest of the watercourse is used for grazing.
As of 1990, visitation consisted of use “mainly by local residents”. It was also considered to have “potential” for use as an educational resource by the Kangaroo Inn Area School which is located about west of the conservation park's southern boundary in the locality of Kangaroo Inn.
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category IV protected area.

Sant'Antonio di Padova, Turin

The Sanctuary of Saint Anthony of Padua (), also known as the Church of Saint Anthony of Padua () is a Roman Catholic place of worship located in the city of Turin, Italy.
History.
The sanctuary was built in 1883, with the purpose of hosting Piedmontese friars from the Order of Friars Minor who lost their housing due to the approval of the Siccardi Laws in 1866 in the then Kingdom of Sardinia. Architect Alberto Porta supervised the construction of the sanctuary, and opted for a mix of gothic revival and romanesque revival styles. Since its construction, the sanctuary has offered a soup kitchen service for the poor.
The building was damaged by Allied bombardments during World War II, in 1942 and 1943.

Franz Alfred Schilder

Franz Xaver Alfred Johann Schilder (born 13 April 1896 in Královské Vinohrady, now a district of Prague, died 11 August 1970 in Halle ) was an Austrian-born German biologist, taxonomist, malacologist and honorary professor of animal geography.
Life.
Franz Alfred Schilder was born on 13 April 1896 in Prague suburbs. In 1908, Schilder moved to Vienna. Having graduated from school in 1914, he studied medicine, but the next year his studies were interrupted by war. After the war, he continued studies in ethnography, geography and paleontology. In 1921, he became a Doctor of Philosophy.
In 1922, Schilder emigrated to Germany. In Berlin he started attending the Entomological Museum. Around this time Schilder married Maria Heitrich, a German chemist. In 1925, Schilder already was a recognized scientist at Naumburg/Saale in the state institute for research on "Phylloxera", remaining there until 1947. In 1945, Schilder became a professor of zoology at the University of Halle-sur-Saale where he taught zoogeography and statistics.
At first, he combined teaching at Halle with his primary work at Naumburg, however in 1947 he relocated to Halle and started teaching also genetics and anthropology. Between 1954 and 1963 Schilder also lectured one day a week in Leipzig. Schilder retired in 1962, but even after that he was invited to lecture frequently until 1966.
Schilder was a member of both English societies, of the German Zoological Society, the German Malacozoological Society, and an honorary member of the Hawaiian Malacological Society and the Keppel Bay Shell Club.
Franz Albert Schilder died on 11 August 1970 in Halle.
Research.
Since the time when Schilder read an ethnological work "Muschelgeldstudien" by O. Schneider, he became interested in studying the "Cypraeacea" and wrote his dissertation about it. "Cypraeidae" was Schilder’s main research interest throughout his life. Along with his wife, Maria Schilder they were a prolific team of mollusc systematists.
Schilder’s complete bibliography comprises over 400 titles, including malacological, entomological, biometrical, etc. as well as text books. Among others he published "Lehrbuch der Allegomeinen Zoogeographie", a text which focuses on the recognition of biogeographic areas at all geographic scales. A summary and conclusion of his work "“A Catalogue of living and fossil Cowries”" was written jointly with his wife, Maria Schilder and published after his death in 1971.
Schilder established 45 new genera and 483 new species and subspecies. In his honor were named: the genus "Schilderia" Tomlin 1930; the recent species "Lyncina schilderorum" Iredale 1939, the fossil species "Zoila schilderi" Dey (1932) 1941, and the race "Cypraea tigris schilderiana" Cate 1961.

Louis Philippe style

The style of architecture and design under King Louis Philippe I (1830–1848) was a more eclectic development of French neoclassicism, incorporating elements of neo-Gothic and other styles. It was the first French decorative style imposed not by royalty, but by the tastes of the growing French upper class. In painting, neoclassicism and romanticism contended to become the dominant style. In literature and music, France had a golden age, as the home of Frédéric Chopin, Franz Liszt, Victor Hugo, Honoré de Balzac, and other major poets and artists.
Much of the style was taken from the personality of the King himself. Unlike his Bourbon predecessors, he wore business dress, not formal robes, he lived in Paris, and he shunned ceremonies; he carried his own umbrella, and imposed no official styles.
Louis Philippe furniture had the same types and forms as the earlier French Restoration style, but with less decoration; comfort was the primary consideration. The Louis Philippe commode, with a marble top and a marquetry covering, was a popular example of the style.
Architecture.
The style of public buildings under Louis-Philippe was determined by the Académie des Beaux-Arts, or Academy of Fine Arts, whose Perpetual Secretary from 1816 to 1839 was Quatremère de Quincy, a confirmed neoclassicist. The architectural style of public buildings and monuments was intended to associate Paris with the virtues and glories of ancient Greece and Rome, as it had been under Louis XIV, Napoleon and the Restoration. Under Louis Philippe, the monuments begun by Napoleon, including the Arc de Triomphe were completed. New monuments, such as the Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde and the July Column in Place de la Bastille were purely classical. The July Column was inaugurated on 28 July 1840, on the anniversary of the July Revolution, and dedicated to those killed during the uprising. Following the return to Paris of the ashes of Napoleon from Saint Helena in 1840, they were placed with great ceremony in a tomb designed by Louis Visconti beneath the church of Les Invalides. 
The reign of Louis-Philippe also saw the beginning of a movement to preserve and restore some of the earliest landmarks of Paris, inspired in large part by Victor Hugo's hugely successful novel "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" ("Notre-Dame de Paris"), published in 1831. The leading figure of the restoration movement was Prosper Mérimée, named by Louis-Philippe as the Inspector-General of Historic Monuments. The Commission of Public Monument was created in 1837, and in 1842, Mérimée began compiling the first official list of classified historical monuments, now known as the Base Mérimée.
The first structure to be restored was the nave of the church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, the oldest in the city. Work also began in 1843 on the cathedral of Notre-Dame, which had been badly damaged during the Revolution, and stripped of the statues on its façade. Much of the work was directed by the architect and historian Viollet-le-Duc, who sometimes, as he admitted, was guided by his own scholarship of the "spirit" of Medieval architecture, rather strict historical accuracy. The other major restoration projects were Sainte-Chapelle and the Hôtel de Ville, dating to the 17th century; the old buildings which pressed up against the back of the Hôtel de Ville were cleared away; two new wings were added, the interiors were lavishly redecorated, and the ceilings and walls of the large ceremonial salons were painted with murals by Eugène Delacroix. Unfortunately, all the interiors were burned in 1871 by the Paris Commune.
The Beaux-Arts style.
During the same period, a small revolution was taking place at the École des Beaux-Arts, led by four young architects; Joseph-Louis Duc, Félix Duban, Henri Labrouste and Léon Vaudoyer, who had first studied Roman and Greek architecture at the Villa Medici in Rome, then in the 1820s began the systematic study of other historic architectural styles including French architecture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. They instituted teaching about a variety of architectural styles at the École des Beaux-Arts, and installed fragments of Renaissance and Medieval buildings in the courtyard of the school so students could draw and copy them. Each of them also designed new non-classical buildings in Paris inspired by a variety of different historic styles; Labrouste built the Sainte-Geneviève Library (1844–50); Duc designed the new Palais de Justice and Court of Cassation on the Île-de-la-Cité (1852–68); Vaudroyer designed the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers (1838–67), and Duban designed the new buildings of the École des Beaux-Arts. Together, these buildings, drawing upon Renaissance, Gothic, Romanesque and other non-classical styles, broke the monopoly of Neoclassical architecture in Paris.

Finely-crafted inlaid furniture in the traditional fashion continued to be made in Paris by craftsmen such as Georges-Alphonse Jacob-Desmalter (1799–1870), the grandson of Georges Jacob, the royal cabinet maker for Louis XVI. He designed and made new furniture for the Tuileries Palace when it became the new residence of Louis Philippe in the 1830s, including a cabinet for the concert room decorated with an incrustation of ebony, red seashell and gilded bronze sculptural decoration (see gallery).
During the reign of Louis Philippe, forms of furniture changed little from the French Restoration period; comfort became a greater priority. Furniture became darker and heavier. The forms of chairs became rounded, with curving legs, and the backs of armchairs curved slightly in inward. In the gondola armchairs and chairs, the curved back and arms curved around and enfolded the person sitting. The Voltaire armchair had a high slightly curving back, padded armrests, and short legs.
The Louis Philippe commode was solid and heavy, and had a marble top and a front covered with a thin layer of light wood, often with an inlay of designs of dark wood, usually rosewood or mahogany, in patterns of oak leaves, palmettes, or other floral or vegetal decoration. Over the course of the period, the coloring was reversed; the darker woods were used more commonly to cover the furniture, with lighter woods like sycamore, holly and lemon wood used for inlays.
Tables were usually round or oval, often mounted on a pedestal, with cut-off or slanting corners. A variety of small tables became popular: writing tables, work tables, and the "coiffeuse", or dressing table, equipped with an oval mirror. The legs of these tables were often in the shape of an S or of a lyre.
Sculpture.
The most prominent sculptor of the Louis Philippe style was the Swiss-born James Pradier, who made one of the most important monumental works of the period, a group of statues of "The Victories" that surround the tomb of Napoleon Bonaparte. He also made other neoclassical works that often approached eroticism and romanticism. Gustave Flaubert wrote of him: "This is a great artist, a true Greek, the most antique of all the moderns; a man who is distracted by nothing, not by politics, nor socialism, and who, like a true workman, sleeves rolled up, is there to do his task morning til night with the will to do well and the love of his art." He was largely forgotten after the Louis Philippe period.
Another notable sculptor from the older generation was David d'Angers (1788-1856) who had studied with Jacques-Louis David. He worked largely in an expressive neoclassical style, illustrated in his statue of "Philopoemen hurt" (1837), now in the Louvre.
Other sculptors with more enduring fame were François Rude, who made his celebrated "La Marseillaise" sculpture (formally known as "The departure of the volunteers"), a ten-meter high bas-relief for the Arc de Triomphe (1833–36), a project begun by Napoleon and completed by Louis Philippe. Rude also made the romantic "Napoleon awakening to immortality" in 1845–47. This illustrated popular movement to restore the reputation of Napoleon and the revolutionary spirit, which had been suppressed under the Restoration, but which reappeared with the return of the ashes of Napoleon to France under Louis Philippe. The Napoleonic spirit emerged triumphant in the 1848 Revolution, and the election of Napoleon III as the first President of France.
Painting.
The two most important painters of the Louis Philippe period, Eugène Delacroix and Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres were completely opposite in style, philosophy and temperament; Delacroix, the champion of romanticism, painted his celebrated "Liberty Leading the People" in 1830, shortly after the 1830 revolution that brought Louis Philippe to power, personifying the figure of Liberté as a bare-breasted classical goddess in the baroque style. The painting was acquired by the government of Louis Philippe for the Luxembourg Palace, but was soon returned to the painter because of its controversial political message, and was not shown again in public again until 1855, under Louis Napoleon. Thereafter it entered the collection of the Louvre.
Ingres was the champion of the French neoclassical style, and in addition the master of the portrait. However, his "Martyrdom of Saint-Symphorien" in 1834 was very badly received by French critics, who preferred Delacroix, and he departed Paris in disgust to become director of the French Academy in Rome, where he remained until 1841. In Rome he painted the first of his Odalisque paintings, scenes of slaves in Turkish baths.
From 1833 onwards, Delacroix received major commissions to decorate government buildings in Paris. In 1833 he began work for the Salon du Roi in the Chambre des Députés, Palais Bourbon, which was not completed until 1837, For the next ten years he painted in both the Library at the Palais Bourbon and the Library at the Palais du Luxembourg. In 1843 he decorated the Church of St. Denis du Saint Sacrement with a large "Pietà".
None of the other painters of the Louis Philippe era had the ability or status of Ingres or Delacroix, but they did have great ambitions. They included Paul Delaroche (1797-1856), a classicist in the Ingres tradition, who painted ceiling murals for the redecoration of Louvre in 1831, and for the murals of the hemicycle of the École des Beaux Arts in 1837, which included the sixty-six most famous painters since antiquity. He was considered the dean of historical paintings, specializing in executions and martyrdoms.
Another notable painter of the period was Thomas Couture (1815-1879), a student of Antoine-Jean Gros, a muralist in the style called "Theatrical Romanticism". He received a commission for an eight-meter long painting for the Luxembourg Palace, titled "The Romans in their decadence". The finished painting borrowed from the old masters, the classicists, and the romantics, crowding dozens of figures into a single canvas depicting Roman decadence.
Literature.
The reign of Louis Philippe was a golden age for French literature; many of France's most famous writers published major works. The movement of romanticism became dominant in French literature.
Victor Hugo published four volumes of poetry, and in 1831 published "Notre-Dame de Paris" ("The Hunchback of Notre-Dame"), which was quickly translated into English and other European languages. The novel led to the restoration of the cathedral and other medieval monuments in Paris. In 1841, Louis-Philippe made Hugo a peer of France, a ceremonial position with a seat in the upper house of the French parliament. Hugo spoke out against the death penalty and for freedom of speech. While living in his house on the "Place Royale" (now Place des Vosges), he began working on his next novel, "Les Misérables".
François-René de Chateaubriand refused to swear allegiance to Louis-Philippe, and instead secluded himself in his apartment at 120 Rue du Bac and wrote his most famous work, "Mémoires d'outre-tombe", which was not published until after his death. He died in Paris on 4 July 1848, during the French Revolution of 1848.
in 1832 Honoré de Balzac conceived the idea of a series of books that would paint a panoramic portrait of "all aspects of society;" eventually called "La Comédie Humaine". He declared to his sister, "I am about to become a genius." He published "Eugénie Grandet", his first bestseller, in 1833, followed by "Le Père Goriot" in 1835, the two-volume "Illusions perdues" in 1843, "Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes" in 1847, "Le Cousin Pons" (1847) and "La Cousine Bette" (1848). In each of the novels, Paris is the setting and a major participant.
Alexandre Dumas published "The Three Musketeers" (1844); "Twenty Years After" (1845); "The Vicomte de Bragelonne" (1847); "The Count of Monte Cristo" (1845–1846); "La Reine Margot" (1845); "La Dame de Monsoreau" (1846); and many more novels, in addition to many theatrical versions of his novels for the Paris stage.
Stendhal published his first major novel, "Le Rouge et le Noir", in 1830, and his second, "La Chartreuse de Parme", in 1839.
Other major Paris writers who produced important works included George Sand, Alfred de Musset, and Alphonse de Lamartine. The poet Charles Baudelaire, born in Paris, published his first works, essays of art criticism.
Music.
Paris was the musical capital of Europe between 1830 and 1848. It was the home of Chopin, Liszt, Richard Wagner, Berlioz, and Verdi at various times during the period. Romanticism was unchallenged as the dominant movement. Music played an important part in the regime from the very beginning, during the 1830 revolution that overthrew Charles X. The famed tenor Adolphe Nourrit, who had starred in the operas of Rossini, went onto the stages of Paris and emotionally sang the Marseillaise, which had been forbidden during the First Empire and the Restoration.
The most famous musical exile in Paris was Frédéric Chopin, who arrived in September 1831 at the age of twenty-one, and did not return to Congress Poland because of the crushing of the Polish uprising against Russian rule in October 1831. Chopin gave his first concert in Paris at the Salle Pleyel on 26 February 1832, and remained in the city for most of the next eighteen years. He gave just thirty public performances during these years, preferring to give recitals in private salons. On 16 February 1838 and on 2 December 1841, he played at the Tuileries for King Louis-Philippe and the royal family. (He also gave a recital for the royal family in October 1839 in the "Château de Saint-Cloud"). He earned his living from commissions given by wealthy patrons, including the wife of James Mayer de Rothschild, from publishing his compositions and giving private lessons.
Franz Liszt also lived in Paris during this period, composing music for the piano and giving concerts and music lessons. The two men were friends, but Chopin did not appreciate the manner in which Liszt played variations on his music. Liszt wrote in 1837 in "La Revue et Gazette musicale": "Paris is the pantheon of living musicians, the temple where one becomes a god for a century or for an hour; the burning fire which lights and then consumes all fame." The violinist Niccolò Paganini was a frequent visitor and performer in Paris. In 1836, he made an unfortunate investment in a Paris casino, and went bankrupt. He was forced to sell his collection of violins to pay his debts. Richard Wagner came to Paris in 1839, hoping to present his works on the Paris opera stages, with no success. Some interest was finally shown by the director of the Paris Opera; he rejected Wagner's music but wanted to buy the synopsis of his opera, "Le Vaissau fantôme", to be put to music by a French composer, Louis-Philippe Dietsch. Wagner sold the work for five hundred francs, and returned home in 1842.
Of the French composers during the period Hector Berlioz was the most prominent. He had come to Paris from Grenoble in 1821 to study medicine, which he abandoned for music in 1824, attending the Conservatory in 1826, and won the "Prix de Rome" for his compositions in 1830. He was working on his most famous work, the "Symphonie Fantastique", at the time of the July 1830 revolution. It had its premiere on 4 December 1830.
Three Paris theaters were permitted to produce operas under Louis Philippe: The Royal Academy of Music on rue Le Peletier; the Opéra-Comique; and the Théâtre-Italien, nicknamed "Les Bouffes". The Royal Academy, financed by the government, was in dire financial difficulties. In February, the government handed over management of the theater to a gifted entrepreneur, Doctor Véron, who had become wealthy selling medicinal ointments. Véron targeted the audience of the newly-wealthy Parisian businessmen and entrepreneurs; he redesigned the theater to make the loges smaller (six seats reduced to four seats), installed gas lights to improve visibility, and launched a new repertoire to make the Paris Opera "both brilliant and popular". The first great success of the new regime was "Robert le Diable" by the German composer Giacomo Meyerbeer, which premiered on November 21, 1831. Meyerbeer wrote a succession of popular operas. At the end of his four-year contract, Doctor Véron retired, leaving the opera in an admirable financial and artistic position.
The Opéra-Comique also enjoyed great success, largely due to the talents of the scenarist Eugène Scribe, who wrote ninety works for the theater, put to music by forty different composers, including Daniel Auber, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Fromental Halévy (La Juive (1835)), Cherubini, Donizetti, Gounod and Verdi (for whom he wrote "Les vêpres siciliennes"). Scribe left behind the grand mythological themes of earlier French opera, and wrote stories from a variety of historical periods which, with a mixture of strong emotion, humor and romanticism, exactly suited the taste of Parisian audiences.
The Théâtre-Italien completed the grand trio of Paris opera houses. After the fire at the Salle Favart, it moved briefly to the Odéon Theater and then permanently to the Salle Ventadour. In their repertoire, the ballet played a very small part, the costumes and sets were not remarkable, and the number of works was small; only a dozen new operas were staged between 1825 and 1870; but they included several famous works of "Bel Canto" opera, including "I Puritani" by Bellini and "Marino Faliero" and "Don Pasquale" by Donizetti. Verdi lived primarily in Paris between 1845 and 1847, and staged four of his operas at the Théâtre-Italien: "Nabucco", "Ernani", "I due Foscari", and "Jérusalem". The leading Italian singers also came regularly to sing at the Théâtre-Italien, including Giovanni Rubini, the creator of the role of Arturo in Bellini's "I Puritani", Giulia Grisi, Fanny Persiani, Henriette Sontag and Giuditta Pasta, who created the role of "Norma" in Bellini's opera.
French composers including Hector Berlioz struggled in vain against the tide of Italian operas. Berlioz succeeded in getting his opera "Benvenuto Cellini" staged at the Royal Academy in 1838, but it closed after just three performances, and was not staged again in France during his lifetime. Berlioz complained in the "Journal des Debats" that there were six operas by Donizetti in Paris playing in one year. "Monsieur Donizetti has the air to treat us like a conquered country," he wrote, "it is a veritable war of invasion. We can no longer call them the lyric theaters of Paris, just the lyric theaters of Monsieur Donizetti."
With the growing popularity of classical music and the arrival of so many talented musicians, Paris encountered a shortage of concert halls. The best hall in the city was that of the Paris Conservatory on rue Bergére, which had excellent acoustics and could seat a thousand persons. Berlioz premiered his "Symphonie Fantastique" there on December 30, 1830; on December 29, 1832, Berlioz presented the Symphony again, along with two new pieces, "Lelio" and "Harold en Italie", which he wrote specially for Paganini to play. At the end of the performance, with Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas in the audience, Paganini bowed down humbly before Berlioz in tribute.
The Concert Society of the Paris Conservatory was founded in 1828, especially to play the symphonies of Beethoven – one at each performance, along with works by Mozart, Hayden and Handel. It was the first professional symphonic association in Europe. A second symphony association, the Societé de Sainte-Cecile, was founded shortly afterwards, which played more modern music; it presented the Paris premieres of Wagner's "Tannhäuser" overture, works by Schubert, the "Symphonie Italienne" of Mendelssohn, the "Fuite en Égypte" of Berlioz, and the first works of Charles Gounod and Georges Bizet.
Ballet and dance.
The ballet had been an integral part of the Paris Opera since the time of Louis XIV the 17th century. A new style, Romantic ballet, was born on March 12, 1832 with the premiere of "La Sylphide" at the Salle Le Peletier, with choreography by Filippo Taglioni and music by Jean-Madeleine Schneitzhoeffer. Taglioni designed the work as a showcase for his daughter Marie. "La Sylphide" was the first ballet where dancing "en pointe" had an aesthetic rationale and was not merely an acrobatic stunt. Other romantic ballets that had their first performances at the Opera were "Giselle" (1841), "Paquita" (1846) and "Le Corsaire" (1856).
Among the great ballerinas to grace the stage of the Opéra during this time were Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Carolina Rosati, Fanny Elssler, Lucile Grahn, and Fanny Cerrito.
Lucien Petipa danced the male lead in "Giselle" at its premiere, and his younger brother Marius Petipa also danced for a time at the Paris Opera. Marius Petipa moved from Paris to Saint Petersburg, where he became the ballet-master for the Russian Imperial ballet and created many celebrated ballets, including "The Sleeping Beauty", "La Bayadère" and "The Nutcracker".
Balls, concerts-promenades and the romance.
The Champs-Élysées was redeveloped in the 1830s with public gardens at either end, and became a popular place for Parisians to promenade. It was soon lined with restaurants, cafes-chantants. and pleasure gardens where outdoor concerts and balls were held. The Café Turc opened a garden with a series of concert-promenades in the spring of 1833, which alternated symphonic music with quadrilles and airs for dancing. The 17-year-old Jacques Offenbach wrote his first compositions for the dance orchestra at the Café Turc. The Tivoli, the Bazar of rue Saint-Honoré and the Casino Paganini competed with the Café Turc. In 1837, the King of the Viennese waltz, Johann Strauss I, came in person to in Paris, competing with the French waltz king, Philippe Musard. The outdoor concerts and balls did not stay in fashion for long; most of the gardens began to close after 1838, and Musard took charge instead of the famous masked balls at the Paris Opera. The romance, a song with a simple, tender melody, sentimental words, accompanied on the piano, became the fashion in the Paris salons. Thousands of copies were sold by Paris publishers.
Street music, "goguettes" and the cabaret.
At the beginning of the 1830s, the Paris police counted 271 wandering street musicians, 220 "saltimbanques", 106 players of the barbary organ, and 135 itinerant street singers. The "goguettes", or working class singing clubs, continued to grow in popularity, meeting in the back rooms of cabarets. The repertoire of popular songs ranged from romantic to comic and satirical, to political and revolutionary, especially in the 1840s. In June 1848 the musical clubs were banned from meeting, as the government tried, without success, to stop the political unrest, which finally exploded into the 1848 French Revolution.

Music collections in Prato

Beginning with the recognition of musical collections in Prato conducted by the Center of Musical Documentation of Tuscany, it is possible to trace a synthesis of the history of the citizen’s musical production.
Following a chronological path linked to the most important musical subjects in Prato - institutions, composers and interpreters - and studying the handwritten and printed music brought to us, we were able to delineate a historical and cultural itinerary of the pratese musical life.
History.
The most antique musical collections of the city of Prato are the “pergamenacei” (made of parchment) liturgical book of the fourteenth century of Chapter origin, which are now preserved at the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo. 
The fourteenth-century cappella left little trace and merged with the new one, established in 1535. Beginning in 1981, a great deal of musical material of the latter institution belongs to the Archivio Storico Diocesano (Historical Diocesan Archive), in which there are many sources regarding its activities, as in the Archivio del Capitolo della Cattedrale (Archive of the Chapter in the Cathedral).
The cappella saw rotations of Kappellmeister such as Giovanni Francesco Beccatelli (1679-1734), Giuseppe Becherini (1758-1840), Augusto Borgioli (1821-1879), Luigi Borgioli (1864-1939) whose works are conserved in the Historical Archive of the Cappella of the Duomo, together with the works of the most performed artists of the different time periods (Giovan Carlo Maria Clari, Nicola Benvenuti, Giuseppe Gherardeschi). In 1981, The Historical Diocesan Archive also gathered the materials of 61 parishes together, which is preserved today in the Archives of the parishes. There are many chorals and sacred music, manuscripts and printed, that cover a vast period of time, from the fourteenth century to the twentieth century. 
The activities of the chapel were sided with the production of secular music, which left traces mostly beginning in the eighteenth century.
The Cicognini Boarding School has manuscripts of the performances staged by the boarders from 1780 until 1870, including comic operas and dance music from Mozart to Zandonai. Starting in 1842, the group «Concerto Cittadino Edoardo Chiti», of which the archive conserves a large amount of music of various genres used in their frequent concerts; and at the end of the eighteenth century, the choir «Guido Monaco» was formed, which has a musical archive consisting of a large amount of printed edition vocal music.
These institutions represented the musical vocation of the citizens for over a century, offering an example of one of the most important civil musical activities in Tuscany, to which many talented composers contributed. In the 19th century Cesare Ciardi, Attilio Ciardi, Attilio Nuti were active in Prato, and whose autographs are spread throughout the institutions in Prato. The personal archive of Attilio Ciardi is preserved in the Music School «Giuseppe Verdi», which today inherits the civil musical vocation that had inspired the Chiti Band and the «Guido Monaco» Choir. The 1900s saw the revival of the sacred production with the organist of the Cathedral, Guido Guasti, whose documents (especially those regarding the years between 1939 and 1947) are in the Historic Diocesan Archive, with the reopening of the Cappella in 1951, whose materials (printed sacred music in modern editions) are today in the Church of San Francesco, but above all with the activities of the secular composers who most influenced the musical possessions of Prato the 20th century. Dante Nuti, Giovanni Castagnoli, and especially Luciano Bettarini, one of the most important musicians of the 20th century, worked in Prato. What they left behind is preserved in the Historic Diocesan Archive and in great part, in their personal collections at the Music School «Giuseppe Verdi», which possesses also the enormous collections, of recordings and music, of some Pratese collectionists.
In 1969, the «Guido Monaco» Choir founded their children’s choir, and promoted of a competition for the citizens in which music by Nino Rota was also performed. Today this is preserved in the archive of the choir. Books dedicated to musical subjects (some of which come from the antique cappella of the 16th century) are in Roncioniana Library, in the Teatro Metastasio, and in the Salvi Cristiani Collection at the State Archive.

FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League

The FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League is an international volleyball competition contested by the senior women's national teams of the members of the "" (FIVB), the sport's global governing body. The first tournament took place between May and July 2018, with the final taking place in Nanjing, China. United States won the inaugural edition, defeating Turkey in the final.
The creation of the tournament was announced in October 2017 as a joint project between the FIVB, the IMG and 21 national federations. The Nations League replaced the World Grand Prix, a former annual women's international event that ran between 1993 and 2017.
A corresponding tournament for men's national teams is the FIVB Volleyball Men's Nations League.
History.
Adoption.
In June 2017, Argentinian website Voley Plus reported that the FIVB would drastically change the format for both the 2018 World League and World Grand Prix. According to the reports, starting from 2018, the World League and the World Grand Prix would have only one Group (no more Groups 1, 2 and 3) of 16 national teams.
In October 2017, the FIVB announced, via a press release, the creation of the men's and women's Volleyball Nations League, confirming the tournaments as a replacement for the World League and World Grand Prix.
Format.
As in the former World Grand Prix, the competition will be divided in two phases, albeit with changes in the competition formula: a preliminary round (known as preliminary round), with a system of rotating host cities, and a final round played in a pre-selected host city.
The preliminary round is held over five weeks, versus three in the World Grand Prix. Each week, the participating teams are organized in pools, and each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. All games in a pool take place over a weekend in the same city.
When all matches of the preliminary round have been played, the top five teams in the overall standings qualify for the final round, and the remaining ones leave the competition. The host nation automatically qualifies for the final round.
16 national teams will compete in the inaugural edition of the tournament; 12 core teams, which are always qualified, and 4 challenger teams, which can face relegation.
Preliminary round.
The 16 teams compete in round-robin tournament, with every core team hosting a pool al least once. The teams are divided into 4 pools of 4 teams in each week and compete five weeks long, with a total of 120 matches. The top five teams after the round-robin tournament join the hosts in the final round. The relegation will consider the four challenger teams and the last ranked challenger team will be excluded from next edition. The winners of the Challenger Cup would qualify for next edition as a challenger team.
Final round.
The six qualified teams play in 2 pools of 3 teams in a round-robin format. The top 2 teams of each pool qualify for the semifinals. The first ranked teams play against the second ranked teams in this round. The winners of the semifinals advance to compete for the Nations League title.
Challenger Cup.
The FIVB Volleyball Challenger Cup will be a competition for national teams which will run in concurrence with the Volleyball Nations League. The Challenger Cup will consist of teams not participating in the current edition of the Volleyball Nations League and will feature one host team and five teams from the five continental confederations as follows:
The Continental Confederations, responsible for determining the teams that will qualify for the FIVB Challenger Cup, are free to organise their Continental Qualification Tournament or use an existing competition to define the qualified team(s).
The FIVB Challenger Cup will be held before the FIVB Volleyball Nations League Finals and the winners will qualify for the next year's VNL as a challenger team.

St. Dionysius Orthodox Church

St. Dionysius Orthodox Church is an Indian Orthodox church in the city of Al Ain, Emirate of Abu Dhabi. It is the first church dedicated to the sacred memory of Saint Geevarghese Dionysius of Vattasseril, the third proclaimed saint of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. It is the largest Indian Orthodox church in the Arab region.
St. Dionysius of Vattaserril.
Saint Geevarghese Mar Dionysius of Vattasseril (31 October 1858 – 23 February 1934) was the Malankara Metropolitan (primate) of the Indian Orthodox Church. Vattasseril Geevarghese Mar Dionysius is popularly known as "Malankara Sabha Bhasuran" (Malayalam: Malankara Sabha Bhasuran, meaning 'The Great Luminary of Malankara Church'). He received that title in recognition of his contribution to Malankara Church. 
Vattasseril Thirumeni was a man of prayer, determination and dynamism. He was an advocate of the sovereignty and autonomy of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. He was an outstanding orator who emphasized the importance of the Bible when preaching to the faithful. Prayers and fasting were central to his faith. He spent much time in private prayer and silent meditation. He focused on three to four Bible lessons each day. 
By his leadership qualities including powerful charisma and progressive mindedness, the church recognized him as a living saint. 
His legacy survived through his successors and students, including Catholicos of the East, H. H. Baselios Geevarghese II and Metropolitan Kuriakose Mar Gregorios of Pampady. He was apparently inspired by the reformation movements during his time. He maintained an ardent faith, citing Mary of Bethany (). 
Mar Dionysius VI was exalted as a saint and confessor. On the 69th feast day of Mar Dionysius VI (24 February 2003), he was canonized by the Episcopal Synod of Malankara Orthodox Church headed by H. H. Baselios Mar Thoma Mathews II, Catholicos of the East. St. Dionysius is the second Indian to be canonized by the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. Catholicos Baselios Geevarghese II might have foreseen this when he caused "The time will not dim his glory" to be engraved on the tomb of Mar Dionysius VI. 23 February is observed as the saint's feast day. Thousands of believers visit the church to seek his blessings.
A portion of the holy relics of the saint has been preserved in St. Dionysious Orthodox church by the late H. H. Moran mor baselios Paulose II as per the request of the faithful. 
History.
A congregation of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church under the title St. George Orthodox Congregation was initiated in 1968. It was begun by expatriates who had come from Kerala seeking work. During this period the Orthodox Congregation of Abu Dhabi was elevated to the rank of a church and Fr. T. A Jacob was appointed as its resident vicar by the metropolitan of the Kerala region. The faithful in Al Ain contacted him and under his leadership the holy Qurbana was conducted once in three months in one of the houses of the faithful. In 2003, after long years of tribulation, the congregation was elevated to the rank of a church with the title St. Dionysius Orthodox Church. 
In 2010 the rulers of UAE granted the church land for the church building. Worshippers had previously gathered at the parsonage for evening prayers and services and special events were held at other churches. The cornerstone was laid on April 20 by H.G Abraham Mar Seraphim in the presence of the diocesan metropolitan H.G Youhanon Mar Demetrios. Construction began under the blessings of Fr. Saji Abraham. The church fathers had visited the construction site and blessed it. The church is a landmark in the history of the Orthodox Church of India. The building can accommodate up to 1,500 believers. The Dh13 million project was funded by donations from members and local and international benefactors. Sister churches in other emirates were major contributors.

Gogobot

Gogobot (later rebranded Trip.com) was an online travel business headquartered in Palo Alto, California. The company was rebranded Trip.com in November, 2016 and acquired by the Ctrip Group in 2017. Founded in 2010, by Travis Katz and Ori Zaltzman, by 2014 the company was the fifth most visited travel-planning site in the United States.
The platform employed artificial intelligence to allow users to research and book destinations and places to go, including hotels, restaurants, bars and attractions in more than 60,000 destinations, and its community of users could share reviews and pictures from their own travel experiences. "Forbes" referred to the company as a "social network for travelers."
In 2019, following the acquisition by CTrip, CTrip subsidiary Skyscanner merged the company's content and technology into its platform, branding it the "Explore" section of the Skyscanner application.
Description.
Gogobot was a travel-planning and local discovery service that is available both on the web, and via iOS and Android applications. It allowed users to research and book hotels, restaurants, and activities at destinations around the world, reading reviews from its community of travelers and browsing photos. The company was an early pioneer in applying artificial intelligence to travel, leveraging data from a user's location, preselected interests, local weather, past behavior and more to predict places a user may be interested in visiting. In addition to social data, Gogobot allowed users to self identify with more than 19 "Tribes" (e.g. Foodies, Family Travelers, Nightlife lovers) allowing users to "cut through the noise" to see reviews and opinions from people with similar tastes and interests. As part of the planning aspect of the application, users could plan out itineraries, organizing them day by day and syncing them to multiple devices.
In September 2014, the platform debuted a feature called "Gogo This Week" which showcases handpicked events happening that week in large destination cities including Silicon Valley, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, New York City, and London. The application was available online as well as on iOS and Android devices.
Company history.
Gogobot was founded in 2010 by Travis Katz and Ori Zaltzman. Travis Katz had previously served as the senior vice president and GM, International for social media site MySpace, and Ori Zaltzman was the lead architect for Yahoo! Search BOSS and lead technologist at Yahoo! Answers. Katz came up with the idea for an online planning tool while working at MySpace, citing personal frustration with how long it took to make travel plans online, while noting that the larger online trip planning sites lacked "personal relevance."
The company secured $4 million in its first round of venture funding from Battery Ventures in July 2010. The website launched in November 2010. The same year that the website was launched, it was awarded a Crunchie award for best design by TechCrunch, beating AirBnB and About.me. The iOS application was released in October 2011.
In 2011, the platform announced several integrations with companies including Flipboard, Facebook, and Foursquare that would allow users to connect to their friends and other users through aspects of other social media platforms. In 2011, the platform was included in a list of 50 Best Websites by "Time" magazine. In October, 2011, the company raised an additional $15 million in venture capital in a series B round of funding led by Redpoint Ventures.
By 2012, the company's base of active users had grown to over two million members. After identifying that almost 44 percent of the site's users were coming from Europe, the company established a European headquarters in London in April 2012.
The Android application was released in January 2013. Later that year, the company announced a partnership with HomeAway, a vacation rental company. The partnership led to the launch of "Insider Guides," on the HomeAway website and mobile apps allowing HomeAway's property managers and hosts to create personalized guides for their guests, highlighting the best things to see or do near their property. The content and reviews these hosts created would live on both Gogobot and HomeAway sites (including HomeAway and VRBO). The company became the fastest growing travel website in 2013 achieving 3.7 million users.
In 2014, the site had more than 720,000 original reviews of hotels, attractions and restaurants, and 4 million photos. The company launched a redesigned mobile app in 2014 in response to users increasingly using the service for local discovery, rather than simply travel planning. The new site design also included a revamped company logo and a new "Tribes" feature that helps users filter places based on what is popular among people with similar interests such as foodies or adventure-seekers. In November 2014, the company secured $20 million in venture capital financing, led by HomeAway with participation from Redpoint Ventures and Battery Ventures.
In 2016, the company acquired the Trip.com brand from Expedia and the business was rebranded from Gogobot to Trip.com. The same year, the company launched a partnership with Hostelworld to give Hostelworld's customers access, in-app, to Gogobot's City Guides.
In 2017, the company was acquired by Ctrip Group. At the time of the acquisition, CTrip indicated the company had 60 million users. The price of the acquisition was not disclosed. Trip.com, became the flagship brand for CTrip, which renamed the holding company the Trip.com Group. In 2019, the platform was merged into Skyscanner.

Gil Hayward

Gilbert Osborne Hayward (16 October 1917—9 October 2011) was a World War II cryptographer and inventor of the first electronic seal security device.
Career.
As a pupil at Kilburn Grammar School, Hayward became captivated by machines and science. He was the youngest member of the British Astronomical Association, and constructed his own reflecting telescope. He spent weeks in a junkyard to find parts with which he remade an old green Bentley and a Scott Super Squirrel motorcycle, which he then rode. Hayward's mother did not allow him go to university, as a result, Hayward left school at 16 to become an apprentice at Dollis Hill, where he collaborated with Dr Eric Speight on making the TIM speaking clock service.
During the Second World War, Hayward worked at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill with Tommy Flowers, developing the Tunny and Colossus, decryption machines which were crucial to the development of later computers. By the culmination of the war, as many as 15 Tunny machines were used at Bletchley Park, supplying Allied leaders close to 300 messages from the German High Command per week. Amongst other things, Tunny gave important intelligence for D-Day." Over 13,000 messages were read in total.
During World War II, Hayward served in Egypt with the Intelligence Corps, where he developed bugging equipment to listen to conversations between captured German prisoners of war. Expecting to be dropped into Turkey to sabotage telecoms systems, Hayward was instead called back to London to, and was assigned to put effort on code breaking.
At Bletchley Park, Hayward was at the helm of a team of around 12 post office engineers worked to check machines and keep them functioning. At the twilight of the war, he helped dismantle the code breaking machines and reinstall two Colossus machines at Eastcote, North London.
After the war, Hayward worked on a secret voice encipherment system before moving to Ghana to install telecoms networks. In the 1950s, during the Malayan Emergency, Hayward joined the special of the Royal Malaysian Police and was tasked with designing “special techniques devices” for use against the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), the militant arm of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP).
By the 1980s, Hayward had patented the first electronic security seal, setting up the company Encrypta Electronics with his son Mark to manufacture the product. The devices are still used widely in the fields of distribution and transport. In the 1990s he helped researchers at The National Museum of Computing (TNMOC) rebuild the Tunny and Colossus machines by crafting new parts from blueprints he had kept against the orders of Winston Churchill who was concerned that they could fall into Soviet hands. He was honoured with a special medal for his services to codebreaking in 1996.
Hayward's son Mark told BBC Radio 4 that it was 'somewhat disappointing that because he worked in secret work, like all these chaps did, that they were never truly honoured by the country for the contribution they made'.

United Kingdom home front during World War II

The United Kingdom home front during World War II covers the political, social and economic history during 1939–1945.
The war was very expensive. It was paid for by high taxes, by selling off assets, and by accepting large amounts of Lend Lease from the U.S. and Canada. The US gave $30 billion in munitions; Canada also gave aid. The American and Canadian aid did not have to be repaid, but there were also American loans that were repaid.
Britain's total mobilisation during this period proved to be successful in winning the war, by maintaining strong support from public opinion. The war was a "people's war" that enlarged democratic aspirations and produced promises of a better Britain after the war. The media called it a "people's war"—a term that caught on and signified the popular demand for planning and an expanded welfare state. Indeed by 1945 the Post-war consensus emerged that did deliver a welfare state.
The Royal family played major symbolic roles in the war. They refused to leave London during the Blitz and were indefatigable in visiting troops, munition factories, dockyards, and hospitals all over the country. All social classes appreciated how the royals shared the hopes, fears and hardships of the people.
The British relied successfully on voluntarism. Munitions production rose dramatically, and the quality remained high. Food production was emphasised, in large part to free shipping for munitions. Farmers increased the area under cultivation from 12,000,000 to 18,000,000 acres (from about 50,000 to 75,000 km2), and the farm labour force was expanded by a fifth, thanks especially to the Women's Land Army.

Politics.
Planning the welfare state.
The common experience of suffering wartime hardships placed on the political agenda a new consensus regarding the need for a post-war welfare state: universal social security, a free national health service, improved secondary education, expanded housing, and family allowances. The success of the wartime government in providing new services, such as hospitals and school lunches, as well as the prevailing egalitarian spirit, contributed to widespread support for an enlarged welfare state. It was supported by the coalition government and all major parties. Welfare conditions, especially regarding food, improved during the war as the government imposed rationing and subsidized food prices. Conditions for housing worsened of course with the bombing, and clothing was in short supply. Equality increased dramatically, as incomes declined sharply for the wealthy and for white collar workers, as their taxes soared, while blue collar workers benefited from rationing and price controls.
People demanded an expansion of the welfare state as a reward to the people for their wartime sacrifices. The Labour Party took the initiative but the Conservatives took the lead in the Education Act of 1944. It made major improvements in the provision and governance of secondary schools in England and Wales. Historians consider it a "triumph for progressive reform," and it became a core element of the Post-war consensus supported by all major parties.
The goal of a welfare state was operationalized in a famous report by William Beveridge, of the Liberal Party. Beveridge declared war on the five 'giant evils' of Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness. He recommended that the various income maintenance services that had grown-up piecemeal since 1911 be systematized and made universal. Unemployment benefits and sickness benefits were to be universal. There would be new benefits for maternity. The old-age pension system would be revised and expanded, and require that a person retired. A full-scale National Health Service would provide free medical care for everyone. All the major parties endorsed the principles and they were largely put into effect when peace returned.
Planning for postwar housing began in 1941, with Conservatives arguing that more property-owning would give people a real economic stake in society; promises to expand ownership became the signature Conservative issue after 1945, while Labour still deprecated private ownership. All parties wanted to stimulate the construction industry. The consensus policy was that local authorities would lead in the transitional period but that, in the longer run, the majority of new building would be left to the private sector. Local government would then revert to the prewar role, concentrating on slum clearance and provision for the least well-off. Financial stringencies in the late 1940s postponed the ideal plan into the 1950s. –
Economics.
Britain had a highly successful record of mobilizing the home front for the war effort, in terms of mobilizing the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximizing output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people. By 1941 GDP was 21 per cent greater than in 1938, In Britain was the most fully mobilized nation, economically, in the entire war and remains so throughout. Much of this success was due to the systematic planned mobilization of women, as workers, soldiers, and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription. The women supported the war effort, and made the rationing of consumer goods a success.
Finance.
In 6 years of war, there was a net inflow of £10 billion. Of this £1.1 billion came from the sale of investments; £3.5 billion was made up of new borrowing, of which £2.7 billion was contributed by the Empire's Sterling Area. Canada made C$3 billion in gifts and loans on easy terms. Above all came the American money, and loans and Lend Lease grants of £5.4 billion. This funded heavy purchases of munitions, food, oil, machinery and raw materials. There was no charge for Lend Lease supplies delivered during the war. There was a charge for supplies delivered after September 2, 1945. Britain's borrowing from India and other countries measured by "sterling balances" amounted to £3.4 billion in 1945. Britain treated this as a long-term loan with no interest and no specified repayment date. The British treasury was nearly empty by 1945.
When the war began Britain imposed exchange controls. The British Government used its gold reserves and dollar reserves to pay for munitions, oil, raw materials and machinery, mostly from the U.S. By the third quarter of 1940 the volume of British exports was down 37% compared to 1935. Although the British Government had committed itself to nearly $10,000 million of orders from America, Britain's gold and dollar reserves were near exhaustion. The Roosevelt Administration was committed to large-scale economic support of Britain and in March 1941 began Lend-Lease, whereby America would give Britain supplies totalling $31.4 billion which did not have to be repaid.
Industry.
As an island nation, when war broke out in 1939, Great Britain was dependent for so many of its supplies on imports by sea. The days of significant air cargo traffic had yet to arrive but would have been equally vulnerable to enemy attack. Although the term was not used in those days, there was an immediate recourse to recycling to conserve scarce resources. Garden railings were removed for their scrap metal and aluminium kitchen saucepans were collected for their potential in the aircraft industry. Whilst there may have been undue optimism of some of the benefits, nevertheless, the whole population was involved in a practical way in helping the war effort.
David Edgerton has emphasized the success story in producing munitions at home and using the Empire and the U.S. to build a very large high quality stock of weapons. Industrial production was reoriented toward munitions, and output soared. In steel, for example, the Materials Committee of the government tried to balance the needs of civilian departments and the War Department, but strategic considerations received precedence over any other need. Highest priority went to aircraft production as the RAF was under continuous heavy German pressure. The government decided to concentrate on only five types of aircraft in order to optimize output. They received extraordinary priority. Covering the supply of materials and equipment and even made it possible to divert from other types the necessary parts, equipment, materials and manufacturing resources. Labour was moved from other aircraft work to factories engaged on the specified types. Cost was not an object. The delivery of new fighters rose from 256 in April to 467 in September 1940—more than enough to cover the losses—and Fighter Command emerged triumphantly from the Battle of Britain in October with more aircraft than it had possessed at the beginning. Starting in 1941 the U.S. provided munitions through Lend lease that totalled $15.5 billion
Rural economies.
Before the war Britain imported 70% of its food. Home agricultural production increased 35% during the war. In terms of calories, domestic output nearly doubled. Together with imports and rationing, this meant the British were well fed—they ate less meat (down 36% by 1943) and more wheat (up 81%) and potatoes (up 96%).
Farmers increased the number of acres under cultivation from 12,000,000 to 18,000,000 (from about 50,000 to 75,000 km2), and the farm labour force was expanded by a fifth, thanks especially to the Women's Land Army. Farm women had expanded duties, with the young men absent at war. They were helped by prisoners of war from Italy and Germany. The Women's Land Army brought in tens of thousands of young women from urban areas for paid labour on farms that needed them, at about 30 shillings a week. Wages for available male farmworkers tripled during the war to £3 a week.
One new specialty was harvesting timber, for which the government set up the Women's Timber Corps, a branch of the Women's Land Army that operated 1942-46.
For townspeople and even city folk, the government promoted Victory Gardens that grew vegetables, fruits, and herbs. About 1.4 million allotments were made; they took some of the pressure off the food rationing system and boosted civilian morale. Franklin Ginn peels away complex layers of meaning beyond growing some food. Participants were not randomly digging; they were promoting self-sufficiency, imposing control over the domestic sphere, and exhibiting patriotism in working for the common good of winning the war. There were sharply different gender roles and class experiences—gardening had been a favourite elite hobby and the upper class women helping out knew what they were doing. The much touted statistics of additional food production were designed to foster general confidence in the progress of the war, not just the progress of plants.
Rationing.
Rationing was designed to provide minimum standards of essential consumption for all members of society, to reduce waste, reduce trans-Atlantic shipping usage, and make possible the production of more war supplies with less variety. The theme of equality of sacrifice was paramount.
Just before the war began Britain was importing 20,000,000 long tons of food per year, including about 70% of its cheese and sugar, nearly 80% of fruits and about 70% of cereals and fats. The UK also imported more than half of its meat, and relied on imported feed to support its domestic meat production. The civilian population of the country was about 50 million. It was one of the principal strategies of the Germans in the Battle of the Atlantic to attack shipping bound for Britain, restricting British industry and potentially starving the nation into submission.
To deal with sometimes extreme shortages, the Ministry of Food instituted a system of rationing. To buy most rationed items, each person had to register at chosen shops, and was provided with a ration book containing coupons that were only good at that shop. The shopkeeper was provided with enough food for registered customers. Purchasers had to take ration books with them when shopping, so that the relevant coupon or coupons could be cancelled.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Scotland.
The outbreak of the world war in 1939 temporarily arrested the ongoing decline in heavy industry, with the city's shipyards and heavy industries working. To slow arms production down, the Luftwaffe bombed the Clydeside. The worst was the Clydebank Blitz in March 1941 that left tens of thousands of Glaswegians homeless and destruction of housing caused by the war would leave a lasting legacy for the city decades later.
Wales.
Wales had been hard hit by deindustrialisation and high unemployment in the 1920s and 1930s. The war turned the economy around. Because much of Wales was too distant for German bombers and it had a large pool of unemployed men immediately available for work, it suddenly became an attractive relocation destination for war industries and ordinance factories. The historic basic industries of coal and steel saw a very heavy new demand. The best coal seams had long been depleted. It was more and more expensive to get to the remaining coal, but coal was urgently needed, and shipping it in from North America would overburden the limited supply system.
Belfast.
Belfast is a representative British city that has been well studied by historians. It was a key industrial city producing ships, tanks, aircraft, engineering works, arms, uniforms, parachutes and a host of other industrial goods. The unemployment that had been so persistent in the 1930s disappeared, and labour shortages appeared. There was a major munitions strike in 1944. As a key industrial city, Belfast became a target for German bombing missions, but it was thinly defended; there were only 24 anti-aircraft guns in the city for example. The Northern Ireland government under Richard Dawson Bates (Minister for Home Affairs) had prepared too late, assuming that Belfast was far enough away to be safe. When Germany conquered France in Spring 1940 it gained closer airfields. The city's fire brigade was inadequate; there were no public air raid shelters as the Northern Ireland government was reluctant to spend money on them; and there were no searchlights in the city, which made shooting down enemy bombers all the more difficult. After seeing the Blitz in London in the autumn of 1940, the government began to build air raid shelters. In early 1941, the Luftwaffe flew reconnaissance missions that identified the docks and industrial areas to be targeted. Especially hard hit were the working class areas in the north and east of the city, where over 1000 were killed and hundreds were seriously injured. Many people left the city in fear of future attacks. The bombing revealed the terrible slum conditions. In May 1941, the Luftwaffe hit the docks and the Harland and Wolff shipyard, closing it for six months. Apart from the numbers of dead, the Belfast Blitz saw half of the city's houses destroyed. About £20 million worth of damage was caused. The Northern Ireland government was criticised heavily for its lack of preparation, and Northern Ireland's Prime Minister J. M. Andrews resigned. The bombing raids continued until the Operation Barbarossa in June 1941. From January 1942, United States soldiers began to arrive in Northern Ireland, in preparation for the Invasion of Normandy in June 1944.
Civilian casualties.
Figures produced by the Ministry of Home Security give a total of 60,595 civilians killed and 86,182 seriously wounded, directly due to enemy action.
Of these, 51,509 were killed by bombing, 8,398 by V-1 flying bombs or V-2 rockets, and 148 by artillery bombardment. These figures do not include 1,200 killed while on duty with the Home Guard, or 32,000 civilian merchant seamen lost at sea. The total civilian deaths represent 0.1 percent of the United Kingdom population, or about 15 percent of Britain's war dead.
Society and culture.
Evacuations.
Public opinion in the 1930s was horrified at this prospect of massive bombing of major cities. The government planned to evacuate schoolchildren and others to towns and rural areas where they would be safe. Operation Pied Piper began on 1 September 1939, and relocated more than 3.5 million children and teachers - about half from London. The average evacuee traveled about 40 miles, but some traveled longer distances. There was no bombing in 1939, so they soon returned home. After a German invasion was possible and the Blitz began in September 1940, there was a second major wave of evacuation in June 1940 from targeted cities. There were also small-scale evacuations of children to Canada. Many families relocated to safer areas on their own. The host families worked well with most children, however there was a minority from poor, undernourished, unhygienic and uncooperative environments who brought along a strong distrust of authority. The confrontation was an eye-opener to both sides, and played a role in convincing the British middle-class to support expanded welfare programs. For the first time it became clear that middle class and rich people needed help too - they were bombed out of their homes and schools as well. Sociologist Richard Titmuss argues, "Reports in 1939 about the condition of evacuated mothers and children aroused the conscience of the nation in the opening phase of the war." He states that the national government:
Fear.
Historian Amy Bell interprets private diaries, psychologists' notes, and fiction written by Londoners during the war "to reveal the hidden landscapes of fear in a city at war." They feared loss of property, loss of their homes and those of family and friends, destruction of their churches and shops, and their own injury and death. Many saw London as a "potential canker in the heart of Imperial Britain," with British civilization highly vulnerable to internal weaknesses stemming from an "enemy within," specifically, the cowardice among those who remained in London during the war. Worried Londoners often identified as especially susceptible to this weakness the working classes, Jews, and children.
Education.
The quality of elementary education in major cities declined because of poor leadership in handling crises, confusion and inconsistency in evacuation and school closings, the destruction of some buildings in air raids, and the military requisition of others. Students were emotionally upset by the bombings; there were endemic shortages of supplies and teachers. The 1944 Education Act had a major impact on improving secondary schools after 1945, but did little for elementary schools. A lesser level of disruption took place in smaller places that were not bombing targets.
Religion.
All the churches gave enthusiastic support for the war, using their facilities to assist the displaced and comfort the fearful. At the local level, popular religiosity remained a vibrant force. Prayer and Sunday services helped many people handle the horrors and the unknowns of warfare. City people reflected on the reality of sudden death as they huddled in air raid shelters. Some sang:
&lt;poem&gt;God is our refuge, be not afraid,
He will be with you all through the raid.&lt;/poem&gt;
They told each other how miracles were protecting Britain, pointing to the Miracle of Dunkirk, and how this church and that cathedral miraculously survived the blitz. Not all prayers were answered: over 15,000 church buildings were damaged; the Methodists had 9000 churches, of which 800 were totally destroyed. Many laymen who had volunteered for church work before the war, now turned their attention to civil defence.
The Church of England saw its role as the moral conscience of the state. George Bell, Bishop of Chichester and a few clergymen spoke out that the aerial bombing of German cities was immoral. They were grudgingly tolerated. Bishop Bell was chastised by fellow clergy members and passed over for promotion. The Archbishop of York replied, "it is a lesser evil to bomb the war-loving Germans than to sacrifice the lives of our fellow countrymen..., or to delay the delivery of many now held in slavery". Diplomat Harold Nicolson was on the BBC Board when it discussed whether clergy should broadcast forgiveness of our enemies. He told the Board, "I prefer that to the clergy who seek to pretend that the bombing of Cologne was a Christian act. I wish the clergy would keep their mouths shut about the war. It is none of their business."
Standards of morality in Britain changed dramatically after the world wars, in the direction of more personal freedom, especially in sexual matters. The Church of England and the Catholic Church tried to hold the line and stop the rapid trend toward divorce, while the Dissenters were coming to terms with the new reality of divorced members.
While the Church of England was historically identified with the upper classes, and with the rural gentry, Archbishop of Canterbury William Temple (1881 – 1944) was both a prolific theologian and a social activist, preaching Christian socialism and taking an active role in the Labour Party until 1921. He advocated a broad and inclusive membership in the Church of England as a means of continuing and expanding the church's position as the established church. He became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1942, and the same year he published "Christianity and Social Order." The best-seller attempted to marry faith and socialism—by "socialism" he meant a deep concern for the poor. The book helped solidify Anglican support for the emerging welfare state. Temple was troubled by the high degree of animosity inside, and between the leading religious groups in Britain. He promoted ecumenicism, working to establish better relationships with the Nonconformists, Jews and Catholics, managing in the process to overcome his anti-Catholic bias.
Gambling.
The experience of total war 1939 to 1945 meant much less leisure and highly restricted transportation, So attendance fell at gambling venues such as racing tracks for horses and dogs. However the amount of betting stayed high. Anti-gambling organizations other opportunity to use the national emergency to shut down many legitimate gambling activities, but the early successes in curtailing horse racing, dog racing and football—which were the main topics of gambling—were soon reversed as the government saw gambling as a necessary psychological outlet in a time of highly restricted leisure opportunities. The renewed opportunities as well, such as 'unity' football pools and a larger number of illegal neighborhood bookmakers. For the first time there was heavy gambling on Irish horse races, which were not interrupted during the war. The government provided extra petrol needed for the movement of racing horses and dogs.
Women.
Mobilisation.
Historians credit Britain with a highly successful record of mobilising the home front for the war effort, in terms of mobilising the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximising output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people. Much of this success was due to the systematic planned mobilisation of women, as workers, soldiers and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription. The women supported the war effort, and made the rationing of consumer goods a success. In some ways, the government over-responded, evacuating too many children in the first days of the war, closing cinemas as frivolous then reopening them when the need for cheap entertainment was clear, sacrificing cats and dogs to save a little space on shipping pet food, only to discover an urgent need to keep the rats and mice under control. In the balance between compulsion and voluntarism, the British relied successfully on voluntarism. The success of the government in providing new services, such as hospitals and school lunches, as well as egalitarian spirit, contributed to widespread support for an enlarged welfare state. Munitions production rose dramatically, and the quality remained high. Food production was emphasised, in large part to free shipping for munitions.
Parents had much less time to supervise their children, and there were fears of juvenile delinquency, especially as older teenagers took jobs and emulated their older siblings in the service. The government responded by requiring all young people over 16 to register, and expanded the number of clubs and organisations available to them.

Wieland Group

The Wieland Group is a manufacturer of semi-finished products in copper and copper alloys. The group of companies with Wieland-Werke AG as the ultimate parent company is organized into four business units. Since its foundation, the company’s headquarters has been located in Ulm. The Wieland Group has production sites in Asia, Europe and the USA.
History.
Philipp Jakob Wieland took over his uncle’s fine art and bell foundry in Ulm’s Rosengasse in 1820 and by 1828 he was producing brass sheet and wire. Around 1900, he also started to produce rods, tubes and sections. In 1865, the company started production at the new Vöhringen plant using hydropower from the River Iller.
In 1919, the OHG ("Offene Handelsgesellschaft", open trading company) converted into Wieland-Werke AG. This was followed by the development of new technology and machinery as well as the acquisition of additional plants. In 1945, the Ulm plant was largely destroyed by bombs. At the Vöhringen plant, several production facilities were dismantled. After reconstruction, the company expanded its production capacity in the 1950s and 60s and established a worldwide production and sales organization. Today, the Wieland Group consists of approx. 60 companies (manufacturing plants, slitting centers and trading companies) in 40 countries.
In 1834, Philipp Jakob Wieland set up a factory health insurance, today’s Wieland BKK. He also cared for the families and relatives of his factory workers. He built workers’ houses that still exist on the edge of the Vöhringen plant as well as “hygienic facilities”, i.e. bathhouses with tubs and showers. Around 1900, a day nursery was established in Ulm to counteract the high infant mortality rate. The nursery was under the protectorate of Queen Charlotte, with the wife of the factory owner Max Wieland being a nursery board member.
In July 2019, the Wieland Group merged with Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc., an North American manufacturer and distributor of specialized non-ferrous products, which grows the company to over 90 locations with 9,000 employees anda revenue of 5 billion euros.

French ship Terrible (1693)

The Terrible was a First Rank ship of the line of the French Royal Navy.
This ship was ordered to be built at Brest Dockyard on 19 July 1692, to bear the name "Terrible", to replace the previous ship bearing that name destroyed at La Hogue in June 1692. The designer and builder was Blaise Pangalo. Pangalo's ship was laid down in August 1692, launched on 21 February 1693 and completed in May 1693.
She was initially armed with 100 guns, comprising twenty-eight 36-pounders on the lower deck, twenty-eight 18-pounders on the middle deck, twenty-eight 8-pounders on the upper deck, ten 6-pounders on the quarterdeck and six 6-pounders on the forecastle. In 1706 two extra 18-pounders were added on the middle deck, the 8-pounders on the upper deck were replaced by 12-pounders, and two more 6-pounders were added on the quarterdeck, giving her 104 guns. 
The new ship took part in the Battle of Lagos on 28 June 1693, where she was the flagship of "Lieutenant-Général" Louis François de Rousselet de Bourbon, Marquis de Châteaurenault, and at the Battle of Vélez-Málaga on 24 August 1704, where she was the flagship of "Lieutenant-Général" Ferdinand, Comte de Relingue. She was scuttled in Toulon on Louis's orders in July 1707 to avoid being set alight by the bombardment by the English fleet. She was later put back afloat, but in August 1714 she was condemned, and was sold to be taken to pieces during 1714.

Ulmus minor 'Cretensis'

The Field Elm cultivar Ulmus minor 'Cretensis' [:from Crete] was first mentioned by Nicholson in "Kew Hand-List Trees &amp; Shrubs" Vol.2 (1896), as "Ulmus campestris" var. "cretensis", without description. A 1908 herbarium specimen at Kew Gardens with an accompanying description (see 'External links') suggests that 'Cretensis' is not synonymous with "Ulmus minor" var. "canescens", also present on Crete.
Description.
On the Kew herbarium specimen Augustin Ley added the description: "All parts [of the shoots and upper leaf-surface] very glabrous and smooth; [on the leaf underside] axils and leaf-surface along mid-rib hairy; non glandular". The specimen shows obovate leaves, 4 to 6 cm long by 3 to 5 wide, with a small tapering tip, biserrate or triserrate margin, and a 5 mm petiole.
Pests and diseases.
See under "Ulmus minor".
Cultivation.
It is not known whether 'Cretensis' remains in cultivation. An old field elm by the 11th-century Byzantine church of St Nicholas, Kyriakosellia, Apokoronas, western Crete, is in the locality where 'Cretensis' herbarium specimens were collected in the early 20th century (see 'External links'), and outside the small area in central Crete where 'Canescens' has been found. Sfikas (2011), however, refers to 'Canescens' in the Apokoronas area.

Android Pie

Android Pie (codenamed Android P during development) is the ninth major release and the 16th version of the Android mobile operating system. It was first released as a developer preview on March 7, 2018, and was released publicly on August 6, 2018.
On August 6, 2018, Google officially announced the final release of Android 9 under the title "Pie", with the update initially available for current Google Pixel devices, and releases for Android One devices and others to follow "later this year". The Essential Phone was the first third-party Android device to receive an update to Pie, notably coming day-and-date with its final release. The Sony Xperia XZ3 was the first device with Android Pie pre-installed.
, 14.77% of Android devices run Pie (API 28), making it the third most used version of Android.
History.
Android Pie, then referred to as "Android P", was first announced by Google on March 7, 2018, and the first developer preview was released on the same day. The second preview, considered beta quality, was released on May 8, 2018. The third preview, called Beta 2, was released on June 6, 2018. The fourth preview, called Beta 3, was released on July 2, 2018. The final beta of Android P was released on July 25, 2018.
Custom distributions.
There are, as of August 2019, a handful of notable custom Android distributions (ROMs) of 9.0 Pie.
Features.
User experience.
Android Pie utilizes a refresh of Google's "material design" language, unofficially referred to as "Material Design 2.0". The revamp provides more variance in aesthetics, encouraging the creation of custom "themes" for the base guidelines and components rather than a standardized appearance. Bottom-aligned navigation bars are also more prominent. As applied to Android Pie's interface, rounded corners (influenced by the proprietary Google theme used by in-house software implementing Material Design 2.0) are more prominent. In addition, Pie contains official support for screen cutouts ("notches"), including APIs and system behaviors depending on their size and position. Android certification requirements restrict devices to two cutouts, which may only be along the top or bottom of the screen.
The most significant user interface change on Pie is a redesigned on-screen navigation bar. Unlike previous versions of Android, it only consists of a slim home button, and a back button rendered only when available. The bar utilizes gesture navigation: swiping up opens the "Overview" screen, a redesign of the existing recent apps menu. Swiping the handle to the right activates application switching. The gesture bar is used primarily on new devices such as the Pixel 3; existing devices may either use the previous navigation key setup or offer the ability to opt into gesture navigation. As opposed to the previous recent apps menu, Overview utilizes a horizontal layout rather than vertical, and text may also be selected and copied from apps appearing there (although this uses OCR rather than the native text as to conserve resources). The Pixel Launcher exclusively supports the ability to access the app drawer and most recently used apps from the overview as well. However, this integration is proprietary, as there are no current plans to offer the necessary integration to third-party software due to security concerns. In addition, when rotation lock is enabled, rotating the device causes a screen rotation button to appear on the navigation bar.
The notification area was redesigned, with the clock moved to the left, and the number of icons that may be displayed at once limited to four, in order to accommodate displays that may have "notch" cutouts in the center. The drop-down panels attached to quick settings items have been removed; long-pressing a toggle directs users to the relevant settings screen. Notifications for chats can now be threaded, displaying previous messages within (complementing the existing inline reply functionality). If a particular type of notification is frequently dismissed, the user will now be offered to disable it. The Do Not Disturb mode has been overhauled with a larger array of settings.
The power menu now contains a screenshot button (which itself now supports cropping an image after taking one), and an optional "lockdown" mode that disables biometric unlock methods. The volume pop-up now only controls media volume, as well as the choice of sound, vibrate, or silent modes for notifications. Users are directed to the settings menu to change the volume of notifications. A magnifier display has been added to text selection, and "smart linkify" offers access to relevant apps if particular types of text (such as phone numbers or addresses) are highlighted.
Platform.
Android Pie introduces a major change to power management, using algorithms to prioritize background activity by apps based on long-term usage patterns and predictions, dividing apps into "Active", "Working Set" (run often), "Frequent", "Rare", and "Never". Similar "adaptive brightness" settings are adjusted automatically based on detected lighting conditions. Both of these features were developed in collaboration with DeepMind.
The "PrecomputedText" API (also available as a compatibility library compatible with Android 4.0 and newer) can be used to perform text display processing in a background thread as opposed to a UI thread to improve performance. 
The fingerprint authentication API has also been revamped to account for different types of biometric authentication experiences (including face scanning and in-screen fingerprint readers).
Android Runtime can now create compressed bytecode files, and profiler data can be uploaded to Google Play servers to be bundled with apps when downloaded by users with a similar device.
Apps targeting older Android API levels (beginning with Android 4.2) display a warning when launched. Google Play Store is now requiring all apps to target an API level released within the past year, and will also mandate 64-bit support in 2019.
Android Pie supports IEEE 802.11mc, including Wi-Fi Round Trip Time for location positioning.
The camera API now supports accessing multiple cameras at once. Apps may no longer perform background audio or video recording unless they run a foreground service. There is support for the High Efficiency Image File Format (subject to patent licensing and hardware support) and VP9 Profile 2.
DNS over TLS is supported under the name "Private DNS".
Android Go for Android Pie uses less storage than the previous release, and has enhancements to security and storage tracking.
Reception.
Shortly after its launch, several users on Pixel devices and the Essential Phone noted a decrease in battery life. As Android Pie became available to more phones, some users on various devices reported similar comparisons.

Fumiyo Ikeda

Fumiyo Ikeda (Osaka, 1962) is a Japanese dancer, actress and choreographer.
Training.
Fumiyo Ikeda was born in Osaka and grew up in Fukui, Japan. She started ballet at the age of ten. In 1979 she moved to Europe and started studying at Mudra, the Brussels dance school that was founded by Maurice Béjart. There she met Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, whom she joined when she founded her dance company Rosas.
Collaboration with Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker / Rosas.
Fumiyo Ikeda was involved in the creation of almost all Rosas productions from 1983 to 1992 and also was a dancer in them. In 1997 she joined Rosas again. Until 2008 she danced in most Rosas productions. Afterwards she went on tour with the restaging of older Rosas productions, such as "Woud", "Drumming", "Elena's Aria" and "Mozart / Concert Arias. Un moto di gioia".
Work as a choreographer.
Around the end of her second period at Rosas, Fumiyo Ikeda began to create work that is based on her own ideas. First she did that together with Alain Platel and Benjamin Verdonck in "Nine Finger" (2007), which is based on the book "Beasts of No Nation" by Uzodinma Iweala and shows the perversity of the war through the eyes of a child soldier. The production was selected for the Festival d'Avignon 2007. A few years later "in pieces" (2009) followed, a performance she made with the British writer / performance artist Tim Etchells about memory, remembering and forgetting, and about how both are experienced and shown by the body and expressed in language. Together with the Japanese dancer Un Yamada, she created in 2014 the dance duet "amness", with organ music by Johann Sebastian Bach being played by the saxophonists of the Bl!ndman ensemble. In the same year she also created the production "Cross Grip" with the Japanese dancers Llon Kawai, Ayaka Azechi, Kota Kihara and the percussionist Kuniko Kato. "Nine Finger" (2007) was restaged in 2016; Stijn Opstaele replaced Benjamin Verdonck. In 2017 another dance performance followed: "Piano and String Quartet", with a live performance by Ictus Ensemble of the composition "Piano and String Quartet" by Morton Feldman.
Collaboration with others.
After her departure from Rosas around 1992, Fumiyo Ikeda began exploring new horizons. Before she had already collaborated with the American choreographer / dancer Steve Paxton. She participated in theater and film productions like "Vinaya" (Josse De Pauw and Peter van Kraaij, 1992), "De meid slaan" (Josse De Pauw and Tom Jansen, 1993), and "Snakesong / Le voyeur" (Jan Lauwers / Needcompany, 1994). Much later she worked with the Nature Theater of Oklahoma on the production "Life &amp; Times Episode 2" (2010). More recently she worked on "Absence" (Eric Joris and Peter Verhelst / NTGent, 2015), and on "De Sleutel" (Josse De Pauw / LOD, 2016).
Work as a teacher.
Besides dancing and choreographing, Fumiyo Ikeda also gives various workshops on her own work and the Rosas repertoire (including movement material from "Rosas danst Rosas" and "Drumming"). She does this regularly at the Summer School of the dance school PARTS. Several times she was also a teacher at KASK, Ghent. At Rosas she leads the rehearsals for the restaging of the early productions.

Protected tribal belts and blocks in Assam

The Protected Tribal Belts and Blocks in Assam, India are certain regions which was regulated under Chapter 10 of the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation Law, 1886 by the British Government as Belts and Blocks which was later on implemented by the Assam Government in 1947 by Gopinath Bardoloi, the first Chief Minister of Assam and subsequently by later Governments in power to protect the land rights of the aboriginal backward protected tribal classes (mentioned below) from immigrants in regions in which they were predominant at the time of creation (comprising 50% or more of the population) as they were primitive and largely backward. According to it in these certain regions demarcated as Protected Tribal Belts and Blocks land of the following Protected Tribal Classes were to be protected:
The Nepali Cultivators-Graziers were initially included in the list but were removed later on in 1969, so all the Nepali Cultivators-Graziers living in the Protected Tribal Belts and Blocks in Assam till 1969 were to be treated as other non-tribal non-protected class of people. But in 1996, the Assam Government reincluded the Gorkhas or Nepali Graziers and Cultivators as Protected Tribal Class in BTAD areas vide Government Notification No RSD.17/85/PT 1/12 dated 15 March 1996. 
According to the Law, in these Protected Tribal Belts and Blocks in Assam no land of the above-mentioned protected tribal classes can be bought by a non-tribal non-protected class of people. Only the above-mentioned protected tribal classes living inside the Protected Tribal Belts and Blocks or outside in other regions of Assam could buy land from the above-mentioned protected tribal classes. Also, the land rights of the non-tribal non-protected people living in the protected tribal belts and blocks before its creation would be protected but they will be able to buy land only from a non-tribal non-protected class of people living in the belt or block before its creation and not from the above-mentioned protected tribal classes.

Yves Zurstrassen

Yves Zurstrassen (1956) is a Belgian abstract painter. He lives and works in Brussels (Belgium) and in Viens (France).
Yves Zurstrassen's painting is a work always in motion, navigating between lyrical abstraction and abstract expressionism. His approach plays with the general principle of collage and “décollage” of various types of thin paper on successive layers of colour.
Biography.
Yves Zurstrassen was born in Liège in 1956. After a childhood in the Vesdre valley (between the Ardennes and Hautes Fagnes) he left Verviers at the age of 10 with his family to settle in Brussels following the decline of the wool industry. A more turbulent period followed for the adolescent, between the hippie movement and truancy, with one certainty: his world was in painting. At the age of 18 he started to paint, alternating studio work with long periods of work in France, in the charterhouse of La Verne, or in Andalusia, where he painted outdoors. His work was highly influenced by these stays. He exhibited for the first time in Brussels in 1982.
A self-taught painter with training in the graphic arts, he learned his craft in the 80s among the artists’ studios and retrospectives of the masters of abstract expressionism, Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Cy Twombly and Mark Tobey, in opposition to the standard idea at that time in France of the death of painting. Zurstrassen deliberately chose to focus on the rectangle of the painting, with only the stretchers, the canvas, paper, and paint, to seek new freedom of expression.
At the end of the 90s he settled in a disused industrial building that he adapted to his work and studies. Starting in the 2000s his approach evolved, inspired also by his love of the Dada movement, of Kurt Schwitters; at first through small format studies that occupied a more important place in his work; his technique was enhanced by collages of torn, cut-out newsprint integrated into the picture and then detached, removing the paint. He says that he opens windows in the memory of the picture. He integrates into these collages shapes cut from photos that he takes in the public space, urban motifs or details of everyday life, and digitally reworks, as in the monumental (94 m) work installed in the Gare de l'Ouest [Brussels-West Station] in Brussels in 2009. The beginning of the 2010 decade saw the cut-out motifs, which at the beginning were placed on the surface of the composition, change place to completely cover the background.
Jazz and free jazz play an important role in the work of Zurstrassen, strongly influenced in his work by great musicians like John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Eric Dolphy and Evan Parker, with whom he "communicates through painting."

Byloye

Byloye (, "The Past") was a monthly historical magazine published in the Russian Empire by Nikolay Elpidiforovich Paramonov and edited by Vasily Y. Bogucharsky (1861–1915), Pavel E. Shchegolev (1877–1931) and Vladimir L. Burtsev (1862–1942).
Published during 1900–1907, 1908–1912 and 1917–1926, its focus was the history of the revolutionary movement in Russia, from the 18th century to the Russian Revolution of 1905-1907.
History.
Between 1900 and 1904, Vladimir Burtsev published 6 issues abroad, in London, Geneva and Paris. Its contents were on the 1860-1880s movements, especially about Narodnaya Volya ("People's Will"), a populist terrorist organisation, whose views and tactics were idealised by the magazine. Some of the materials published were old illegal literature, but also unreleased memoirs.
In the late autumn of 1905, Burtsev returned to Russia from exile and asked permission to the authorities to publish "Byloye", which he was immediately denied. He convinced Bogucharsky and Shchegolev to become editors of the magazine, and got Nikolay Elpidiforovich Paramonov (1876–1951), owner of the Donskaya Rech publishing house, to publish the magazine.
On January 28, 1906, "Byloye" was reprinted in Saint Petersburg, Russia, following censorship approval, with a monthly edition under the subheading "Журналъ пocвященный иcтopiи ocвoбoдитeльнaгo движeнiя" ("Journal dedicated to the history of the revolutionary movement").
In October 1907, by decree of the St. Petersburg gradonachalnik, publication of "Byloye" was suspended.
In March 1909, by decision of the St. Petersburg Trial Chamber, Shchegolev was sentenced to three years of solitary confinement "for distributing works with the deliberate intention of provoking rebellion". Bogucharsky was deported abroad, and Burtsev, who had experience in being repeatedly expelled, left Russia in good time. "Byloye" resumed publication in 1917 and continued until 1926, published and edited by Shchegolev.

Readymix logo geoglyph

The Readymix logo geoglyph is a large geoglyph of the Readymix logo carved into the ground of the Nullarbor Plain about north west of Caiguna, Western Australia. At the time of its creation the Readymix logo geoglyph was the largest such signage of its kind, and appeared in the Guinness Book of Records between 1972 and 1991, first as the world's largest advertising sign and, later, as the world's largest letters. The wide, tall logo consists of the words "READYMIX" surrounded by a diamond. Each letter is high by wide, with a line thickness of .
History.
Prior to the 1960s, the Eyre Highway was largely a dirt track, with only small sections of lightly graveled or bitumen roads across the 1,664 km length. Work to seal the Eyre Highway was undertaken in the 1960s and 1970s by the state governments of South Australia and Western Australia. In mid-1964, the Readymix Group received a tender to undertake quarrying operations along the Eyre Highway during its construction, beginning in July 1964 at Balladonia, Western Australia. In 1965, the Readymix logo was carved into the ground by a grader driver, exposing the white limestone bedrock of the Nullarbor Plain. The logo was allegedly constructed without approval of the state government or the landholder, although informal permission may have been granted by the station manager at the time.
The reason for the initial construction of the logo is contested. Readymix staff have asserted that the logo was initially conceived as distinctively shaped and thus easily identifiable emergency landing strip for aircraft owned and operated by Readymix. On the other hand, some suggestion has been made that the logo was simply constructed by bored surveyors during a delay in work on the Eyre Highway as a unique advertisement. Regardless of the reason for its initial construction, it is regarded as unlikely that the diamond was ever actually used as a landing strip, and that subsequent regrading served only to maintain the logo as an advertisement and landmark.
During the 1960s and 1970s, Ansett and Trans Australia Airlines domestic flights used a VOR station at Caiguna as a waypoint on routes between Perth and eastern Australian capitals such as Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney. The close proximity of the Readymix logo to this navigational waypoint resulted in the logo being visible to the 400 or so passengers who flew across Australia daily.
Due to increases in aircraft size and the advent of modern navigational technology, by the 1980s domestic flights to and from Perth no longer passed over the logo, instead flying more directly by passing over the Great Australian Bight.
Permission to maintain the logo was eventually withdrawn, and by 1998 the diamond and letters were more or less overgrown and barely visible. Only with the advent of satellite mapping programs has interest in the Readymix Logo renewed.
Legacy.
The Readymix logo geoglyph predates the creation of other modern Australian geoglyphs.
The Readymix logo geoglyph is purported to be the first advertisement visible from space. Several other oversized corporate logos and advertisements have been produced since the creation of the Readymix logo geoglyph in 1965, although it is unlikely the Readymix logo geoglyph served as a direct inspiration.

Parbati Ghose

Parbati Ghose (born Chapala Nayak; 28 March 1933 – 11 February 2018) was an Indian actress, film director and film producer. Ghose was the first female filmmaker from the state of Odisha.
Early life.
Ghose, who was one of eight siblings, was born as Chapala Nayak on 28 March 1933 in Manasinghpatana, Cuttack district, Odisha, British India. Her father, Basudev Naik, managed the Manmohan Press, a prominent book publisher. Ghose attended Sanat Nalini Girls High School. She also trained as a dancer under Kelucharan Mohapatra, Dayal Sharma, and Suresh Routray.
Career.
Ghose began her career as a child voice actor on All India Radio before transitioning to on-screen film roles. She made her film debut as child artist of character Nila Madhav in 1949 film, "Shri Jagannath". Her big break came in the 1953 film "Amari Gaan Jhua" ("Our Village Girl"), where she was cast as the female lead actress. Amari Gaan Jhua, which explored the controversial practice of child marriage, won her positive reviews.
In 1956, Ghose appeared as the lead actress in the successful Odia language film, "Bhai Bhai", alongside her future husband, Gour Prasad Ghose, who was also the producer. "Bhai Bhai", which showcased her prowess as a lead actress, greatly increased her profile in the Indian film industry. It also led to her interest in film directing and production. Thereafter Ghose appeared in "Maa" in 1959, also produced by Gour Prasad Ghose.
Parbati Ghose and her husband produced, co-directed and acted in "Lakshmi" (1962), "Kaa" (1965), "Stree" (1968). These three films won them three national film awards for their work as directors and producers. A few years later, she produced and directed "Chha Mana Atha Guntha" in 1986.She had worked in Hindi and Bengali language Telefilms like 'Prashna' and 'Sopan'. She also appeared in "Sansaar" in 1971.
Her last film as a director and producer was "Salabega" in 1998.
Personal life.
In 1959, she married Gourprasad Ghose and adopted the name Parbati Ghose, given to her by her new in-laws.
Death.
Ghose died on 11 February 2018, at the age of 84 in Bhubaneswar. The state government of Odisha held a state funeral in her honor. Naveen Patnaik, the Chief Minister of Orissa, paid tribute to Parbati Ghose and her contributions to the local and national film industry, noting that "She was an actor, director and producer at the same time. In early days of Odia cinema, she single-handedly uplifted it to a new level. She was really a symbol of women's empowerment when an idea like empowerment was unheard of. Her departure is a great loss to our industry and the world of silver screen. She will always be remembered for her contribution to Odia cinema."

Ethel Rosenfield

Ethel Rosenfield (1910 – 2000) was a Polish-born Canadian sculptor who lived in Montreal, Quebec. After enrolling in art classes in her mid-forties, she began working primarily in limestone and marble, exploring "organic forms, abstract or schematized, the latter representing faces and female bodies". Rosenfield co-founded the Quebec Sculptors' Association in 1962, and her work was exhibited at the Rodin Museum, Expo 67, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, and multiple Canadian universities. Her sculptures are held in permanent collections at Concordia University, the Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal, and the Storm-King Art Centre.
Biography.
Rosenfield was born in 1910 in Kodoc, Poland. She came to Montreal in 1919. Rosenfield later had two children: a daughter and a son.
After she turned 45 and her children were older, she began studying sculpting at the École des Beaux-Arts. Joking about her late start in life as a sculptor, Rosenfield's husband liked to call her "Montreal's Grandma Moses". Her teachers included Quebec sculptors Armand Filion, Sylvia Daoust and Louis Archambault. Rosenfield was one of the founding members of the Quebec Sculptors' Association in 1962.
Although she sometimes worked in wood and bronze, Rosenfield primarily worked in stone, including limestone from Indiana and marble from Carrara, Verona and Quebec. Rosenfield's style as a sculptor often focused on "organic forms, abstract or schematized, the latter representing faces and female bodies". Her work was exhibited at the Musée Rodin in Paris, and in group exhibitions at the Place des Arts, the Thomas More Institute, Sir George Williams University, University of Waterloo, University of Sherbrooke, National Arts Centre, Expo 67, Musee d’Art Contemporaine, and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.
Rosenfield offered mentorship and support to younger artists such as Ora Markstein, a Holocaust survivor from Hungary who immigrated to Canada in the mid-1970s. Upon seeing some photographs of Markstein's earlier plaster sculptures, Rosenfield told her: "But you are thinking in stone! You feel in stone!". Encouraging her to take classes in stone sculpting, Rosenfield arranged for Markstein to receive a scholarship at the Saidye Bronfman Centre.
Rosenfield moved to Toronto in 1978. She died in 2000 in Scarborough, Ontario.
Her sculpture is included in various public and private collections, including Concordia University, the Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal and the Storm King Art Center.

<doc id="56775486" url="?curid=56775486" title="Cable bacteria">
Cable bacteria

Cable bacteria are filamentous bacteria that conduct electricity across distances over 1 cm in sediment and groundwater aquifers. Cable bacteria allow for long distance electron transport, which connects electron donors to electron acceptors, connecting previously separated oxidation and reduction reactions. Cable bacteria couple the reduction of oxygen or nitrate at the sediment's surface to the oxidation of sulfide in the deeper, anoxic, sediment layers.
Discovery.
Long-distance electrical conductance in sediment was first observed in 2010 as a spatial separation of sulfide oxidation and oxygen reduction in marine sediment that was interrupted and re-established at a rate faster than could be explained by chemical diffusion. It was later found that this electrical conductance could be observed across a non-conductive layer of glass microspheres, where the only possible conductive structures were filamentous bacteria belonging to the family Desulfobulbaceae. The conductivity of single, live filaments was later demonstrated by observing the oxidation state of cytochromes using Raman microscopy. The same phenomenon was later observed in freshwater sediments and groundwater aquifers. Within a 15 cm thick top layer of sediment, cable bacteria densities providing total length of up to 2 km per square centimeter of surface have been observed.
Morphology.
Cable bacteria filaments are 0.4—1.7 µm in diameter and up to 15 mm long. Filaments consist of rod-shaped cells with an average length of 3 µm. Filaments are long strings composed of cells stacked together, and can be as long as 30-70mm. Some filaments are composed of upwards of 10,000 cells. Each cell has between 15 and 54 ridges, and ridges span the entire length of the filament. These ridges are hypothesized to contain the cells' conductive structures.
Junctions.
Cells in a filament are connected by junctions. The diameter of junctions between cells in the filament varies from being smaller than the cell diameter, the same diameter as the cells on either side of the junction, or bulging out to become wider than the cell diameter. Junctions are able to withstand more force without breaking than the cells themselves. Cells on opposite sides of each junction are separated; if one cell bursts, the cell on the other side of the junction will remain intact.
Strings.
Cable bacteria contain structures known as strings. Strings are located inside of ridges on the outer membrane and connect one cell to the next. Strings span the length of the entire filament uninterrupted. The width of the strings is about 20-40 nm. The size and function of a string is similar to that of a microtubule. Strings are thought to serve as a structural foundation for filaments and play a key role in maintaining filament shape, especially during growth.
Distribution.
Cable bacteria are generally found in reduced sediments. They can be present as a single filament or as an agglomeration of filaments. Cable bacteria have been identified as being intertwined with the root hairs of aquatic plants and are present in the rhizosphere. Their distribution ranges a gradient of salinities; they are present in freshwater, saltwater lakes, and marine habitats. Cable bacteria have been identified in a diverse range of climatic conditions worldwide, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Japan, Australia, and the United States.
Motility.
Cable bacteria lack flagella, but are capable of motility in the form of gliding by propelling themselves forward through the excretion of substances. Cable bacteria have been observed to move as fast as 2.2 µm/s, with an average speed of 0.5 µm/s. Speed of motility in cable bacteria is not related to size of the bacteria. The average distance a cable bacterium glides is approximately 74 µm without interruption. Cable bacteria filaments tend to bend in half, and their movement is led by the apex of the bend as opposed to leading with one tip of the filament. Twisting to move through rotational gliding is rare, but does occur. Cable bacteria likely engage in oxygen chemotaxis, as they are observed to move when in anoxic or hypoxic environments, and cease gliding when contact with oxygen is made. Although motility is important for other microorganisms, once cable bacteria are located in a place that connects oxygen to sulfide, they no longer need to move. The reduced need for motility could explain why the cable bacteria genome contains fewer operons related to chemotaxis than other Desulfobulbaceae. Fewer operons related to chemotaxis results in limited motility.
Taxonomy.
The two candidate genera of cable bacteria until now described: "Electrothrix" containing four candidate species, found in marine or brackish sediments, and "Electronema" containing two candidate species, found in freshwater sediments, seem to be a monophyletic group. Freshwater and marine cable bacteria have been found to be 88% similar based on 16S ribosomal RNA comparisons. These genera are classified within the family Desulfobulbaceae. According to last common ancestor analysis, cable bacteria likely descended from Deltaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Chromatiales, and Thiotrichales. Cable bacteria are defined by their function rather than their phylogeny, and it is possible that further cable bacteria taxa will be discovered.
Ecological significance.
Cable bacteria strongly influence the geochemical properties of the surrounding environment. Their activity promotes the oxidation of iron at the surface of the sediment, and the resulting iron oxides bind phosphorus-containing compounds and hydrogen sulfide, limiting the amount of phosphorus and hydrogen sulfide in the water. Phosphorus can cause eutrophication, and hydrogen sulfide can be toxic to marine life, meaning that cable bacteria play an important role in maintaining marine ecosystems in coastal areas.
Methane emissions.
The presence of cable bacteria can lead to a decrease in methane emissions from saturated soils. The transfer of electrons through cable bacteria allows the sulfate reduction that occurs in inundated soils to be balanced by sulfate oxidation. Oxidation is possible because of the release of electrons through the cable bacteria filaments. Through this balance, sulfate remains readily available for sulfate reducing bacteria, which out compete methanogens. This causes a decrease in production of methane by methanogens.
Practical applications.
Cable bacteria have been found associated with benthic microbial fuel cells, devices that convert chemical energy on the ocean floor to electrical energy. In the future, cable bacteria may play a role in increasing the efficiency of microbial fuel cells deployed in sedimentary environments. Cable bacteria have also been found associated with a bioelectrochemical system that enhances the degradation of marine sediment contaminated by hydrocarbons and thus may play a role in future oil spill cleanup technologies.

Charlotte Lachs

Charlotte Lachs (1867–1920) was a Swedish-American soprano singer of Bavarian descent. With repertoire including composers such as Johannes Brahms, Hermann Berens, and Carl Czerny, she performed across Europe and America.
Biography.
Charlotte Lachs was born May 21, 1867 in Lindesberg, Sweden, to Friedrichs Lachs, a Bavarian brewmaster who had immigrated to Sweden in 1860, and Fredrika (née Lorentzon). Her siblings included Alice Brauner, and Charles Lachs, a visual artist. For her studies, Charlotte Lachs relocated to her family home region where she was admitted to the Royal Conservatory of Music of Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria. Among her teachers were , Hugo Beyer, and Professor Hans Hasselbeck, the latter who considered her "an artist of great technical ability".
After a concert with the Swedish glee club in Tammany Hall, New York City, Swedish newspaper "Aftonbladet" reported that "still yet old Sweden is capable of sending out nightingales into the world, songbirds in whose soft and fresh tones equivalents are yet to be found".
Charlotte Lachs' multiple concerts across Europe and America made her a singer of "remarkble talent and diligence" with a voice "very fine sonorous and sympathetic" of "great sweetness, fullness, and carrying power", having the "richness of a contralto". Her "captivating", "dramatic fervor" of a "true artist" had her compared to Emma Albani, and Niels Gade spoke of her "in lavish terms of praise". Singing Giacomo Meyerbeer, one account noted that "she could sing so difficult an aria with such accuracy, such artless, bird-like freedom in trill and cadenza, shows a very high degree of careful and thorough training of the best sort".
Charlotte Lachs was also active as music pedagogue, instructing among others Fanny zu Reventlow. Eventually, she would permanently reside in the United States, where she married Frederic Lillebridge, professor at New York College of Music. Lachs was appointed directress of the departments of vocal music at the Conservatory of Music of Mount Allison University, of Belmont University, of Minnesota State University, as well as of Texas Woman's College, the future merger of Texas Wesleyan University.
She died January 13, 1920 in St. Louis, Missouri, United States.

Tutupaca

Tutupaca is a volcano in the region of Tacna in Peru. It is part of the Peruvian segment of the Central Volcanic Zone, one of several volcanic belts in the Andes. Tutupaca consists of three overlapping volcanoes formed by lava flows and lava domes made out of andesite and dacite, which grew on top of older volcanic rocks. The highest of these is usually reported to be tall and was glaciated in the past.
Several volcanoes in Peru have been active in recent times, including Tutupaca. Their volcanism is caused by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate. One of these volcanoes collapsed in historical time, probably in 1802, generating a large debris avalanche with a volume likely exceeding and a pyroclastic flow. The associated eruption was among the largest in Peru for which there are historical records. The volcano became active about 700,000 years ago, and activity continued into the Holocene, but whether there were historical eruptions was initially unclear; some eruptions were instead attributed to the less eroded Yucamane volcano. The Peruvian government plans to monitor the volcano for future activity. Tutupaca features geothermal manifestations with fumaroles and hot springs.
Oral tradition.
The people in Candarave considered Tutupaca to be a "bad" mountain, while Yucamane was the "good" one; this may reflect that Tutupaca had recent volcanic eruptions. The Peruvian geographer Mateo Paz Soldán dedicated an ode to Tutupaca.
Geology and geomorphology.
Tutupaca is north of the town of Candarave in the region of Tacna in Peru. Lake Suches lies north of the volcano, and two rivers flow nearby: the Callazas River, flowing eastward to the north of the volcano, and then southward past Tutupaca's eastern flank, and the Tacalaya River, which flows south along Tutupaca's western flank. The local climate is cold, and the terrain is stony, with little vegetation. During the wet season, the mountain is snow-covered, and meltwater from Tutupaca and other regional mountains is an important source of water for the rivers in the region.
Tutupaca consists of two volcanic complexes: an older complex that is highly eroded, and two northerly peaks which formed more recently. Of these, the eastern peak ("eastern Tutupaca") consists of seven presumably Holocene lava domes and is high, while the western one ("western Tutupaca") consists of lava domes, lava flows and Plinian eruption deposits of Pleistocene age, and reaches a height of . The Global Volcanism Program gives heights of for the eastern and for the western summit. The western peak is the highest summit of Tutupaca.
The base that Tutupaca rises from lies at elevations ranging from to and the volcano covers a surface area of about . The older complex is formed mainly by lava flows, which during the Pleistocene were eroded by glaciers forming up to thick moraines and U-shaped glacial valleys. Cirques and moraines are also found on the western summit, and tephra layers extend west of the volcano. The older complex, which includes lava domes in the form of small hills on its southern part, was the source of ignimbrite that covers the western and southern parts of the volcano. Postglacial lava flows emanating from a vent located between the two peaks have been identified.
Composition.
The older complex and western Tutupaca have erupted andesite and dacite, while eastern Tutupaca has only produced dacite. Trachyandesite and trachyte also occur. The volcanic rocks erupted during the Holocene define a potassium-rich calc-alkaline suite. Dacites from eastern Tutupaca contain amphibole, apatite, biotite, clinopyroxene, iron-titanium oxides, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, quartz, and sphene. Mafic rock fragments are rarely found embedded in Tutupaca rocks. Elemental sulfur deposits have been identified at Tutupaca and a 1996 map of the volcano shows a sulfur mine on its southeastern flank.
Sector collapse.
A wide amphitheater in eastern Tutupaca, open to the northeast, was formed by a major collapse of the volcano. Lava domes from the younger Tutupaca, as well as highly altered lavas from the older complex, are exposed within the collapse scar, which is the origin of a long debris avalanche deposit. The deposit is mostly found within glacial valleys and is interlaid by the Paipatja pyroclastic flow which divides the debris into two units. The pyroclastic flow reaches both Lake Suches north of the volcano and the Callazas River east of it.
The two units of the debris avalanche are distinguished by their appearance. One features long hummock-like hills, as is typical for volcanic debris avalanches, and the other has ridges which vary in length from . The ridges range from only a few meters to more than in height, and from in height. Such ridges have been observed in other collapse deposits such as at Shiveluch volcano in Russia, and have been explained by sorting processes that take place within granular flows. The differences between the two units appear to be because the first unit was formed from the basal part of Tutupaca, while the second unit was formed by the more recent lava domes of the eastern volcano and formed a granular flow.
The collapse possibly started in the hydrothermal system of the volcano and progressed to affect a growing lava dome, with a total volume probably exceeding . The total surface area covered by the collapse is about . This collapse was not the first in the history of Tutupaca: an older collapse occurred on the southeast-east flanks of the volcano and delivered debris through glacial valleys on the eastern and southeastern side of the volcano. Such large collapses of volcanoes took place in historical time at Mount Bandai in 1888 and Mount St. Helens in 1980; they can produce large avalanches of debris.
Geologic context.
Off the coast of Peru, the Nazca Plate subducts at beneath the South America Plate, causing volcanism in three of the four volcanic belts in the Andes, including the Central Volcanic Zone where Tutupaca is located. Other Peruvian volcanoes include Sara Sara, Solimana, Coropuna, the Andagua volcanic field, AmpatoSabancaya, Chachani, Ubinas, Ticsani, Yucamane, and Casiri. During historical times, major eruptions took place in Peru at El Misti 2,000 years ago and at Huaynaputina in 1600, the latter of which claimed 1,500 fatalities and disrupted the climate of Earth.
The basement of the region consists of folded Mesozoic sediments, and Cenozoic volcanic and sedimentary cover which overlies the Mesozoic rocks. There are many tectonic lineaments and faults which were active in the Tertiary; one of these crosses Tutupaca from north to south, and others influence the positions of geothermal features. The Huaylillas ignimbrite complex underlies some of the volcanic centres, which include a first set of eroded volcanoes that were active between 8.4–5 and 4–2 million years ago, principally erupting lava flows. These were followed by a second set of volcanoes which were also mainly active with lava flows, such as Casiri, Tutupaca, and Yucamane. A third phase formed dacitic lava domes such as Purupuruni about 100,000 years ago. Other, older stratovolcanoes are found at Tutupaca and are heavily eroded by glaciers.
Climate and vegetation.
Most of the volcanoes in the Central Volcanic Zone are located at over elevation where the climate is cold with frequent freezes. Most precipitation falls between January and March, at Tutupaca it amounts to . In the Western Cordillera, altitudes between are dominated by vegetation such as cacti, herbs, Peruvian feather grass, and yareta, but also lichens and mosses. Wetlands, called "bofedales", display a diverse plant life. Above elevation plant life diminishes and in 20032012 by there was perpetual snow.
Eruption history.
Tutupaca is about 700,000 years old. The older complex was active at first with lava flows and then with a major explosive eruption; a pumice-and-ash flow of the older complex forms the "Callazas" deposit. The small lava domes on the older complex have been dated to 260,000 ± 200,000 years ago. Volcanic activity continued into the Holocene, and the volcano is considered to be potentially active. Today, fumaroles occur on the summit of Tutupaca and seismic activity has been recorded.
There are reports of eruptions in 1780, 1787, 1802, 1862 and 1902, supported by dates obtained through radiocarbon dating showing there were eruptions during this period. Some authors believed that Yucamane volcano was a more likely source for these eruptions, but Samaniego 2015 "et al." showed that Yucumane last erupted 3,000 years ago, implying that the reported eruptions, especially the 1802 and 1787 events, most likely occurred at Tutupaca.
The sector collapse of eastern Tutupaca was accompanied by an eruption that was among the largest in Peruvian history, reaching a volcanic explosivity index of 3 or 4. Contemporaneous chronicles document ashfall as far as to the south in Arica. The collapse has been dated to 1731–1802 with high probability and is thought to be associated with the 1802 eruption. The eruption was probably triggered by the entry of fresh, hot magma into a dacitic magma chamber. Shortly before the collapse, a pyroclastic flow erupted from the volcano probably as a consequence of the collapse of a lava dome. It formed a deposit on the east flank of Tutupaca, which reaches a thickness of . The previous eruption may have destabilized the volcano and triggered the main collapse, which also generated the Paipatja pyroclastic flow. The area was thinly inhabited at the time, and thus the impact of the eruption was small.
Hazards.
Based on the history of Tutupaca, a future eruption can be envisaged where renewed activity causes another collapse of the volcano. In this case, about 8,000–10,000 people, as well as neighboring geothermal power and mining infrastructure, would be in danger. Several small towns, diversion dams, irrigation canals, and the two roads IloDesaguadero and TacnaTarataCandarave would also be vulnerable. Other dangers are ballistic rocks, pyroclastic flows, scoria avalanches, ash and pumice rains, volcanic gas and lahars.
The Peruvian Instituto Geológico, Minero y Metalúrgico (INGEMMET) has published a volcano hazard map for Tutupaca. In 2017, Tutupaca was identified as one of the volcanoes to be monitored by the future Peruvian Southern Volcano Observatory. This would entail surveillance of earthquake activity, changes in the composition of fumarole gases and deformation of the volcanoes, and real-time video. This project, budgeted to cost 18,500,000 Peruvian sols ( US dollars) and involves the construction of thirty monitoring stations and the main observatory in the Sachaca District, became active in 2019. Publication of regular activity reports began in May 2019.
Geothermal activity.
Tutupaca is also the name of a geothermal field in the neighborhood of the volcano, which includes the areas of Azufre Chico, Azufre Grande, Callazas River, Pampa Turun Turun, and Tacalaya River; they are part of the same geothermal system whose temperature at depth is higher than . The fields feature fumaroles, geysers, mud pots and occurrences of sulfur, both solid and in the form of hydrogen sulfide gas, as well as siliceous sinter and travertine deposits. Hot springs at the foot of the Tutupaca volcano discharge water into the rivers.
Tutupaca has been mentioned as a potential site for geothermal power generation. In 2013, Canada's Alterra Power and the Philippine Energy Development Corporation developed a joint venture to work on a geothermal prospect at Tutupaca, although work at Tutupaca had not begun by October 2014.

Judería de Córdoba

The Judería de Córdoba, ‘the Jewish Quarter of Córdoba’, is the area of the Spanish city of Córdoba in which the Jews lived between the 10th and 15th centuries. It is located in the Historic centre of Córdoba, northeast of the Mezquita Catedral (the Mosque-Cathedral), in the area of the following streets: Deanes, Manríquez, Tomás Conde, Judíos, Almanzor and Romero.
It is one of the most visited areas by tourists given that, besides the Mosque, you can see monuments such as the Sinagoga (Synagogue), the Zoco Municipal (Zoco Municipal Market) or the Museo Taurino (Bull-fighting Museum), among others. It is part of the historic centre of Córdoba which was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994.
Calle de la judería de Córdoba (Jewish Quarter of Córdoba Street).
Córdoba went through a period when three peoples (Christian, Jewish and Muslim) and their respective religions lived together, albeit, the non-Muslim population living subjugated under Islamic Law with Jews having their own court system. Walking through the Jewish Quarter, along the Calle de los Judíos (Jewish Street), visitors can now find a magnificent bronze statue dedicated to Maimónides, the great Jewish philosopher and doctor from Córdoba.
During this period, the majority of the Jewish people lived under the rule of Islam. During the four years of Umayyad hegemony, cultural, artistic and commercial Muslim activities turned Al-Ándalus (Muslim Spain) into the most cultured country in Europe. Historians talk of Córdoba with admiration, the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate, which turned into a magnificent cultural centre with its lakes and parks, amazing palaces and mosques. The court attracted and exercised its patronage over poets and philosophers, men of literature and science.
During the 10th century, Córdoba was the largest economic and cultural centre of the Western world.
In 756 AD, the Umayyad Abd-al-Rahman I, turned Córdoba into the capital of Muslim Spain and during the following 250 years it turned into one of the largest commercial and intellectual centres in the world. In 929 AD, Abd-al-Rahman III, proclaimed the caliphate and the city reached its highest splendour, rivalling Damascus and Baghdad, centres of great economic and intellectual prosperity. From the 11th century, due to the disintegration of Muslim power in Spain, part of the cultural success of Córdoba was lost, although it remained a centre for people of literature and scholars. In the 12th century, the actions of philosophers Averroes and Maimónides stand out. In 1236, Fernando III el Santo (The Saint) took the city and integrated it into the Kingdom of Castile.

Frances McEwen Belford

Frances McEwen Belford (January 13, 1839 — January 27, 1921) was an American activist based in Denver, Colorado, known as the "Mother of the Lincoln Highway" for her leadership in creating the coast-to-coast interstate highway named for Abraham Lincoln.

Philharmonic Piano Quartet

The Philharmonic Piano Quartet was a New York-based ensemble of four pianists active from 1948 until the mid-1950s. Despite their name, the ensemble had no connection with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. They toured throughout the United States and made two recordings for the Columbia Masterworks label.
History.
The quartet was formed in 1948 when they made the first of their several tours of the United States under the sponsorship of Columbia Artists Management. They made their official New York City debut in a concert at Lewisohn Stadium on June 25, 1949. The ensemble also appeared in syndicated radio broadcasts of ABC's "Piano Playhouse" and made two LP recordings for the Columbia Masterworks label in 1949 and 1950.
All four of the original members, Ada Kopetz, Bertha Melnik, Max Walmer, and John Scales, were trained at the Juilliard School, two of them under Alexander Siloti. By the mid-1950s the original quartet had been replaced by Gisela Richter, Moreland Kortkamp, Emmett Vokes and Herbert Rogers, all of whom were likewise graduates of Juilliard.
Although classical music predominated in their repertoire, they also included pieces from musical theatre and folk music in their performances and recordings. Their music was arranged for four pianos by the German-born composer and conductor Moritz von Bomhard.

Johanne Bindesbøll

Karen Johanne Bindesbøll (1851–1934) was a Danish textile artist who specialized in embroidery. Together with Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen, from 1873 she ran a retail business in Copenhagen, selling embroidered goods and training young women to sew. The business proved to be highly successful over the next 30 years, attracting custom from individuals, churches and schools, and receiving several international awards. It closed in 1903 to enable Bindesbøll and her colleague Konstantin-Hansen to create large tapestries for Frederiksborg Castle.
Biography.
Born on 5 January 1851 in Aarhus, Karen Johanne Bindesbøll was the daughter of the Golden Age architect Michael Gottlieb Birckner Bindesbøll (1800–56) and Andrea Frederikke Andersen (1819–99). She was brought up in an architectural environment in which decorative art and textiles played an important part. She was taught drawing and embroidery at home, frequently with the help of the artistic women who came to visit. After her father's early death, it became necessary for Johanne and her elder sister Maria (1849–1915) to develop their sewing skills as a means of earning an income. Her younger brother, Thorvald (1846–1908), who became a designer and an architect, often prepared their designs and patterns. The family continued to enjoy close contacts with the cultural families of the day, especially those who befriended the painter P.C. Skovgaard.
Together with Konstantin-Hansen, in 1873 she opened a business on Købmagergade in central Copenhagen. They were later joined by Anna Sarauw and by Johanne's sister, Marie. The shop thrived on its good selection of patterns and materials, complemented by the expertise of the women who ran it. Bindesbøll was recognized for the efficient way she dealt with difficult customers. She was also a strong supporter of Danish embroidery traditions in comparison with those from Germany. Many of their patterns were based on the artwork of P.C. Skovgaard, Constantin Hansen, and Thorvald Bindesbøll.
In 1900, Bindesbøll and Konstantin-Hansen were commissioned to recreate the tapestries from Frederiksborg Castle which had been destroyed in the 1859 fire. After carrying out substantial research, they embarked on the task in 1903. After Konstantin-Hansen died in 1925, Bindesbøll completed the work in 1928.
Johanne Bindesbøll died on 9 July 1934 in Copenhagen and is buried in Frederiksberg Ældre Kirkegård.

Janet Conney v. The Regents of the University of California

Janet Conney v. The Regents of the University of California, et al., was a case in which the Los Angeles County Superior Court, Second Appellate District, Division Seven awarded a $4.06 million judgment in March 2007, after the appeals court upheld the lower court ruling. A large portion of the award went to the 4 attorneys, while Conney received approximately $2.95 million of the judgment against the University of California in a sex discrimination and retaliation case.
The Regents' general counsel stated they did not believe the allegation was supported by evidence, and that the university would seek redress through the trial court and at the appellate level.
Conney won the suit and was awarded $4.06 million in March 2007. The California Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal filed by the Regents of the University of California.
The judge also awarded $515,450 in attorney’s fees. With interest and appellate attorney’s fees, the total award over $4 million.
During the 9-day jury trial (because UCLA did not want to settle the initial claim of unfair pay), many professors and even the chairman of the department at UCLA testified. Many of their statements contradicted their own depositions, which had been taken about 4 months before the trial. Under oath, the professors testified there was a separate pot of money that the men received, in addition to their base salary. This was one of many incriminating pieces of testimony to which the jury agreed that Dr. Conney had been discriminated against on the basis of her gender. Another part of the award was for interference with current and also future pay and promotion.

Mathematical models of social learning

Mathematical models of social learning aim to model opinion dynamics in social networks. Consider a social network in which people (agents) hold a belief or opinion about the state of something in the world, such as the quality of a particular product, the effectiveness of a public policy, or the reliability of a news agency. In all these settings, people learn about the state of the world via observation or communication with others. Models of social learning try to formalize these interactions to describe how agents process the information received from their friends in the social network. Some of the main questions asked in the literature include:
Bayesian learning.
Bayesian learning is a model which assumes that agents update their beliefs using Bayes' rule. Indeed, each agent's belief about different states of the world can be seen as a probability distribution over a set of opinions, and Bayesian updating assumes that this distribution is updated in a statistically optimal manner using Bayes' rule. Moreover, Bayesian models typically make certain demanding assumptions about agents, e.g., that they have a reliable model of the world and that the social learning rule of each agent is common knowledge among all members of the community.
More rigorously, let the underlying state be θ. This parameter could correspond to an opinion among people about a certain social, economic, or political issue. At first, each individual has a prior probability of θ which can be shown by P(θ). This prior could be a result of the agents' personal observations of the world. Then each person updates their belief by receiving some signal "s". According to the Bayesian approach, the updating procedure will follow this rule:
formula_1
where the term formula_2 is the conditional probability over signal space given the true state of the world.
Non-Bayesian learning.
Bayesian learning is often considered the benchmark model for social learning, in which individuals use Bayes' rule to incorporate new pieces of information to their belief. However, it has been shown that such a Bayesian "update" is fairly sophisticated and imposes an unreasonable cognitive load on agents which might not be realistic for human beings. 
Therefore, scientists have studied simpler non-Bayesian models, most notably the DeGroot model, introduced by DeGroot in 1974, which is one of the very first models for describing how humans interact with each other in a social network. In this setting, there is a true state of the world, and each agent receives a noisy independent signal from this true value and communicates with other agents repeatedly. According to the DeGroot model, each agent takes a weighted average of their neighbors' opinions at each step to update their own belief.
The statistician George E. P. Box once said, "All models are wrong; however, some of them are useful." Along the same lines, the DeGroot model is a fairly simple model but it can provide us with useful insights about the learning process in social networks. Indeed, the simplicity of this model makes it tractable for theoretical studies. Specifically, we can analyze different network structure to see for which structures these naive agents can successfully aggregate decentralized information. Since the DeGroot model can be considered a Markov chain, provided that a network is strongly connected (so there is a direct path from any agent to any other) and satisfies a weak aperiodicity condition, beliefs will converge to a consensus. When consensus is reached, the belief of each agent is a weighted average of agents' initial beliefs. These weights provide a measure of social influence.
In the case of a converging opinion dynamic, the social network is called "wise" if the consensus belief is equal to the true state of the world. It can be shown that the necessary and sufficient condition for wisdom is that the influence of the most influential agent vanishes as the network grows. The speed of convergence is irrelevant to the wisdom of the social network.
Empirical evaluation of models.
Along with the theoretical framework for modeling social learning phenomenon, there has been a great amount of empirical research to assess the explanatory power of these models. In one such experiment, 665 subjects in 19 villages in Karnataka, India, were studied while communicating information with each other to learn the true state of the world. This study attempted to distinguish between two most prominent models of information aggregation in social networks, namely, Bayesian learning and DeGroot learning. The study showed that agents' aggregate behavior is statistically significantly better described by the DeGroot learning model.

Philosophy (brand)

philosophy is a North American skin care and cosmetics brand founded in 1996 by Cristina Carlino, acquired by The Carlyle Group in 2007, and later acquired by Coty, Inc. in 2010.
History.
philosophy was founded in Phoenix, AZ by Cristina Carlino. Prior to philosophy, Carlino founded Bio Medic, a medically based skin care line created for distribution in clinical settings by plastic surgeons and dermatologists. philosophy products were inspired by years of medical research that helped to shape the skin care treatments, peels and protocols offered in medical practices.
1990s.
philosophy launched at a press event on March 21, 1996, at the Rainbow Room in New York City, New York. The first product available was purity made simple, a facial cleanser that the brand continues to offer. It was available exclusively at Barneys New York before being offered in other retailers such as Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue. Shortly thereafter, Carlino appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show to promote philosophy; Winfrey would continue to be a fan and brand evangelist, with her baby picture being featured on a special 15th anniversary edition of hope in a jar, the brand’s moisturizer. philosophy’s first fragrance, amazing grace, also made its debut that year followed by its second fragrance, pure grace. In 1997, philosophy launched their in-home peel product—a new concept for retail cosmetics at the time. French cosmetics store chain Sephora began to stock philosophy in 1998. In 1999, the brand expanded into bath products including shampoo, shower gel and bubble baths. By the end of the ‘90s, philosophy became the first skin care brand to partner with home-shopping retailer QVC.
2000s.
Particularly through home-shopping television sales, philosophy debuted “super-sized” versions of several items in 2000. In 2003, the brand expanded into fragrances with the falling in love line. The decade also saw the publication of a branded cookbook and the release of skin care kits designed to target damage, specific skin conditions or concerns, such as acne or anti-aging. In 2005, the brand launched shower for the cure, a multitasking bath product that could be used as a shampoo, shower gel or bubble bath, with all net proceeds given to the Women’s Cancer Research Fund. In 2007, philosophy was acquired by The Carlyle Group for an estimated $450 million.
2010s.
Coty, Inc. acquired philosophy from The Carlyle Group in late 2010 in a deal that was valued at approximately $1 billion. One of the goals of this acquisition was to expand the Coty portfolio with an entry into the luxury skin care market. After acquiring the philosophy brand, Cody revamped the original fragrance, 
Amazing Grace, which negatively changed the fragrance, causing thousands of loyal customers to complain and boycott not only the Amazing Grace products, but the brand in its entirely. Even after many years of loyal customer complaints across numerous retail channels, Cody has not returned to the original formula of the Amazing Grace fragrance as of 2020. In 2014, philosophy released an updated version of their hope in a jar line: renewed hope in a jar; it debuted domestically, then launched globally in selected European and Asian markets. Soon to follow were several more additions to the philosophy skin care line, including ultimate miracle worker, uplifting miracle worker and take a deep breath, which includes day and nighttime moisturizers and an eye cream. 2016 saw the opening of the freestanding flagship philosophy retail store in Paramus, NJ.
Products.
Though initially founded as a skin care line, philosophy has since expanded into color cosmetics, fragrance and bath and body products. Each product includes an inspirational name and saying on the packaging.
Charity.
hope &amp; grace initiative.
In 2014, philosophy established the hope &amp; grace initiative to help raise awareness of mental health and wellbeing topics. The majority of funding from the hope &amp; grace initiative supports community-based mental health efforts. For every philosophy product sold in the US, the brand contributes 1% of sales to the hope and grace fund. Each year the hope and grace fund awards multiple grants to local organizations, including Bringchange2mind and NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), working toward promotion, prevention and treatment of women in need of mental healthcare. In 2017, the brand released a new national campaign and PSA to support the hope &amp; grace initiative.
Endorsements.
Oprah Winfrey.
Oprah Winfrey has been a long-time endorser of philosophy, starting shortly after the brand’s launch. In 2005, Winfrey gifted hope in a jar to an audience of Hurricane Katrina relief volunteers. In 2010, Winfrey included hope in a jar in her final Favorite Things list. philosophy honored Winfrey by including a picture of her as a baby on special edition packages of hope in a jar the same year
Natasha Bedingfield.
In 2015, English singer-songwriter Natasha Bedingfield partnered with philosophy to support its hope &amp; grace initiative. Bedingfield created an exclusive, original song, “Hope” for the brand
Ellen Pompeo.
In 2016, American actress and Grey’s Anatomy star, Ellen Pompeo partnered with philosophy for the #CoolAger campaign, the goal of which was to help dispel the stigma women face over aging. The campaign also launched their uplifting miracle worker line of products. As part of the launch, philosophy donated $10,000 to the Aviva Family and Children’s Services, a program chosen by Pompeo that provides mental healthcare to at-risk children and families.
Gabby Bernstein.
In 2015, philosophy named world-renowned spiritual guru, motivational speaker, life coach and best-selling author, Gabby Bernstein as its wellbeing ambassador.

Blank Banshee 1

Blank Banshee 1 is the second studio album by Canadian musician and producer Blank Banshee. It was released as a free digital download via Bandcamp on October 20, 2013.
Background and composition.
Production for "Blank Banshee 1" began in late 2012 with tracks such as ‘"Eco Zones"’ appearing as early as February 2013. The album was announced officially through social media on September 22, 2013. The music video for "Infinite Login" was released preceding the album on October 19, 2013.
Blank Banshee 1 consists of 15 tracks, largely instrumental in nature. It was produced using an Akai APC40 and features heavy use of 808 drums and micro-samples sourced from video games, and early 2000s computer software. Themes of consumerist detachment and alienation appear throughout the album. Song titles such as “"Infinite Login"”, “"Anxiety Online!"” and “"Cyber Slums"” assert a juxtaposition of modern technology, angst and desolation. The album has been called Vaportrap and ‘Post-Internet’. It manifests a "future sound that can be ‘cold’ and digital-and even carry connotations of luxury and the virtual world".
"Blank Banshee 1" was produced in Victoria, Canada.
The album artwork was designed by Blank Banshee and depicts a series of colored cubes in a triangular formation over a monochromatic background.
"Blank Banshee 1" has been released on Cassette Tape, Compact Disc, Vinyl and USB Flash Drive independently through the online store Hologram Bay.
Paradise Disc.
Paradise Disc is a series of 6 computer animated videos produced by Banshee, serving as the official music videos for "Blank Banshee 1".
The series was released via YouTube between October 19, 2013 and January 1, 2014.
Reception.
The Fader called "Blank Banshee 1" "a masterwork of the new digital psychedelia" and a "definitive document of the Vaporwave era".
Music from the album has appeared in the Vice series "Love Industries."

She wrote for the UK's first black glossy magazine "Root" and became a founding member and director of the UK's first Black music Radio station Choice FM (started in 1990 and eventually rebranded as Capital XTRA).
Thompson subsequently founded, in 1996, the European Federation of Black Women Business Owners (EFBWBO).
In 2014 she published her first book, "7 Traits of Highly Successful Women on Boards", in which she says she is "laying down a challenge to society, to provide a level playing field so that our young women with potential to be future leaders, can be the confident citizens of Europe, including possibility of being on the Board of a national or international corporation, and not be excluded like so many women of this generation are, purely on the grounds of her gender".
Thompson has worked with many public bodies and chaired or served on the boards of numerous organisations, including government agencies. In February 2018, she was appointed chair of The Radio Academy.
Awards and recognition.
Yvonne Thompson received the European Women Of Achievement Award in 2001.
In the 2003 Queen's Birthday Honours she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for Services to Black and Ethnic Minority Business.
In 2005 she received an honorary doctorate from London Metropolitan University for services to small business, and mass communications, and has also been awarded an honorary degree from Plymouth University. Other honours accorded her include the declaration by the Mayor of Houston, Texas, of 4 January 2004 as "Yvonne Thomson Day".

Marie Lamont

Marie Lamont, also referred to as Mary Lawmont (1646–1662), was executed for witchcraft during the reign of Charles II just after Witchmania had peaked in the United Kingdom. Her youth at the time of her execution made her case unusual.
Life.
Marie Lamont lived in Inverkip, a parish in the burgh of Renfrew in which persecution of witches was particularly rife between the years 1640–1690. At a young age she was accused of being a witch, and after confessing was presented for trial on 7 May 1662.
Background.
Sir Archibald Stewart of Blackhall, Laird of Ardgowan had applied to the Privy Council for a Royal Enquiry into the practice of witchcraft in the Inverkip area. During this later period of witch persecution the right to assemble a number of commissions of justiciary was granted by the Privy Council to gentlemen in every county. The enquiries preceding the commissions of justiciary were supplementary to the regular enquiries instituted by the State and Church. The Royal Enquiry relevant to Marie Lamont appointed a commission of nine men, one of whom was Sir Archibald Stewart the Sheriff Depute of Perth- a man who was probably a relative of Sir Archibald Stewart the Younger of Blackhall. The other members of the commission were John Brisbane the Younger of Bishopton, Cornelius Crawford of Jordanhill, Alexander Cuningham of Craigends (a church elder), Sir George Maxwell of Nether Pollok, Hugh Montgomery of Silverwood (another Sheriff Depute), Robert Montgomery of Hazlehead, John Porterfield the Younger of that Ilk, and Archibald Stewart of Scotstown. Sir Archibald Stewart of Blackhall himself was not part of the commission but nevertheless was present at the trial. The Reverend John Hamilton, minister at Inverkip between 1626–1664, was also involved in Marie's case but is not listed as being part of the commission. The Rev Hamilton was known to be a 'zealous persecutor of witches' and by the end of his career had adopted a radical approach to Presbyterianism. A graduate minister of the time could enhance his prestige and show himself to be worthy of his hire by using his academic learning (learning being considered particularly important in cases of witchcraft) to protect the local community against Satan and his witch followers.
The witch hunts in 17th century Scotland were sanctioned by the Witchcraft Act of 1563, which had made the practice of witchcraft a capital offence. Society at the time was strongly patriarchal, with women being generally oppressed. The usual victims of the hunts were female, and a commonly shared characteristic was a sharp tongue along with a lack of deference shown towards authority. Where the social class of the accused was known, most (64%) fell into the middle range; of the remainder 29% were in the lowest socioeconomic group and 6% the highest. The ages recorded showed the majority (75%) to have been between 30 and 60 years old.
The torture and degradation to which the victims were subjected prior to the trial itself were often so severe that a confession was seen to be the best option for the accused, and execution would come as a release.
By the time of Marie Lamont's trial the prerequisites for putting a person accused of witchcraft to trial had become more rigorous, and the Privy Council had stated that a confession must be voluntary and not obtained under torture. In June 1661, the year before Marie appeared before the Commission, the precondition was added that the accused must be "of compleat age", and by July 1662 had further added that the accused must not be subjected to pressure and must be of sound mind. The preconditions were open to interpretation at a local level where older views were still prevalent. Being troubled in conscience or having feelings of despair were viewed by Puritans as the emotional sign of the liminal stage between the life of sin and that of regeneration and thus the accused being in this state of mind could be interpreted as confirmation of guilt.
Confession and execution.
Marie's trial was held in the locale and lasted for one day. At trial she freely admitted that she had become a witch at the age of 13 years, when under the influence of Catherine Scott she allegedly renounced her Christian faith, was baptised by the devil and renamed "Clowts". She confessed to having sexual relations with the devil several times when he appeared to her as a brown dog, and this had left marks on her right side where he had nipped her. She said that along with Jean King, Kattie Scott, Janet Holm and sundry others she had met at the bucht-gait of Ardgowan in the presence of the devil, who appeared to them on this occasion in the shape of a black man with cloven feet. They were directed to gather sand from the shore and scatter it about yetts of Ardgowan, and about the minister's house. She was accused of shape shifting into a cat and of stealing milk by means of magic. The milk theft involved drawing a tether made from the hair of many cows' tails over the mouth of a mug and speaking the words "In God's name, God send us milk, God send it, and meikle of it". Marie also confessed to dancing round the Kempock Stone with others and attempting to throw the stone into the sea, the intention being to sink ships sailing in the Firth of Clyde.
On the same day and by the same commission five other women were tried for witchcraft. These women are named as Margaret Duff, Jonet (sic) Hynman, Margret (sic) Letch, Margret (sic) Rankin, and Kathrin Scott.
Lawmont was burned at the stake in 1662, possibly outside the Auldkirk of Inverkip.

Margaret Partridge

Margaret Mary Partridge (8 April 1891 – 27 October 1967) was an electrical engineer, contractor and founder member of the Women's Engineering Society (WES) and the Electrical Association for Women (EAW). Her business worked with WES to identify and employ female apprentices, including Beatrice Shilling. Partridge also helped campaign to change the International Labour Organisation convention on night work for women in 1934, after Shilling was found working on her own in a power station at night, thus contravening the existing regulations.
Early life and education.
Margaret Partridge was born in Nymet Rowland, Devon on 8 April 1891. She was educated at Bedford High School, Bedford, and obtained the Arnott and Jane Benson scholarship to study mathematics at Bedford College, London from 1911, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1914. After graduating, Partridge initially tried teaching, before working for an engineering consultant in London where she found her true interest, working in engineering.
Engineering career.
'Today a man met me in the road and threatened to cut down some wires because he didn't like the look of them.'In 1917, Partridge moved to the engineering company Arthur Lyon &amp; Wrench, which manufactured searchlights. Taking advantage of the opportunities available to women working in industry during the First World War, she trained as an engineering apprentice and advanced to supervisor of the test department. At the end of the war, she decided to move back to the family home in Devon to set up her own electrical consulting business, M. Partridge &amp; Co., Domestic Engineers, and advertised in the Women's Engineering Society's Journal "The Woman Engineer" under the slogan 'Women for Women's Work.' Her company soon expanded to bid for contracts to provide electricity supply for small towns and villages. She received a great deal of practical support and financial advice from Dr John Purves MIEE, an electrical engineer who would later advise on the electricity supply scheme for the whole of the west of England. Purves encouraged Partridge to set up electrical lighting companies for Cheriton Fitzpaine, Thorverton and Bampton where she brought electricity to the homes of the inhabitants for the first time. Although most residents were excited at the new developments, she also had to deal with complaints about rights of way and wires extending across properties and gardens.
Partridge was a delegate at the first meeting to develop the Electrical Association for Women, held on 12 November 1924 at 1 Upper Brook Street, home of Lady Katharine Parsons. The attendees represented the great and good of the electrical and engineering world and a large number of influential women's organisations. The meeting heard a paper from Mrs. Mabel Lucy Matthews on her proposal for an organisation to help raise the burden of domestic drudgery from women through the use and increased availability of electricity. Following what was described as "a lively discussion", Partridge proposed a resolution, which was agreed unanimously, “…to form a Women’s Electrical Association” and wishing “to put on record its thanks to Mrs Matthews”. The name was soon changed to the Electrical Association for Women to avoid confusion with the acronym of the Workers’ Educational Association.
She presented a paper entitled "Producing and Distributing Electricity" at the International Conference of Women in Science, Industry and Commerce organised by Caroline Haslett and the Women's Engineering Society at the British Empire Exhibition on 16 July 1925, speaking alongside the American engineer Ethel H. Bailey and physical chemist Isabel Hadfield. Partridge decided to help young women who were interested in engineering as a career by offering apprenticeships specifically for young women leaving school. She wrote to Caroline Haslett asking for recommendations and was successful in appointing Beatrice Shilling who was an immediate success. Partridge and her partner, Margaret Rowbotham, encouraged Shilling to study at Manchester University and Shilling became a pioneering aeronautical engineer. It was Shilling who was discovered working on her own in a power station at night in contravention of the ILO Convention concerning Employment of Women during the Night (1919), which stated that women were not permitted to do any kind of industrial work at night. This case, with support from the Women's Engineering Society, eventually led to a change in the convention in 1934, exempting women who were working in a supervisory role.
During World War II, Partridge was appointed as the Ministry of Labour Women's Technical Officer for the South West, advising factories on the employment of women in munitions.
Retirement and later work.
Following her retirement. Partridge continued to live in Devon, with Margaret Rowbotham, and encouraged the members of her local Women's Institute to wire the village hall for electricity. On 15 September 1962, the couple wrote a letter of "grandmotherly advice" on the joys of retirement to their fellow women engineers in WES, and listed designing and supervising the building of a sports pavilion, and the conversion of a local stately home into a boys' school as well as serving on the Parish Council as part of their retirement activity. 
The remains of both Margarets lie in Willand churchyard.
Work for the Women's Engineering Society.
Partridge joined the Women's Engineering Society in 1920. She became Vice-President in 1942, and President in 1943. She succeeded Gertrude Entwistle in the role and was succeeded by Dr. Winifred Hackett in 1946.
Commemoration.
A blue plaque was unveiled by Devon History Society at Margaret Partridge's former home in Willand, Devon in March 2019.

Addison Caldwell

&lt;mapframe latitude="37.363609" longitude="-80.263367" zoom="9" width="274" height="177" align="right" /&gt;
William Addison Caldwell became the first student to enroll in the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (V.A.M.C.) in the school's inaugural year in 1872. V.A.M.C. was later named Virginia Polytechnic Institute And State University (Virginia Tech). Caldwell hiked as much as 28 miles through today's Jefferson National Forest in the Allegheny Mountains from Sinking Creek, Craig County to Blacksburg, Va. to enroll as the school's first student on October 1, 1872.
Early life.
William Addison ("Add") Caldwell was born on January 10, 1856 in Sinking Creek, Craig County, VA as the second of George Charlton and Lorena Givens Caldwell's nine children. Generations of the Caldwell family had lived in the area beginning in the 1760s, when King George III of Great Britain granted land to their forebear, John Caldwell. Addison's father, George and grandfather, Archibald Caldwell were both farmers and lived in a 2-story home at the base of Sinking Creek Mountain, where they raised their families.
George, a Confederate veteran, wanted a better life for his children and encouraged their education. Caldwell most likely attended one of the many small schools located near the family farm, or was taught by an instructor at home. He may have become aware of the new agricultural and mechanical school in Blacksburg through the many newspaper advertisements placed by the school's founding president, Charles L.C. Minor. 
The Caldwell March.
At the age of 16, Caldwell and his older brother, Milton M. "Mic" (age 18) made arrangements to attend Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (V.A.M.C.) in 1872. The brothers hiked from Sinking Creek, Craig County to Blacksburg, Va., located 26 miles southwest of the Caldwell farm on the far side of Gap Mountain. The Caldwell brothers' familiarity with foot trails may have assisted them in shortening the hike considerably. Addison enrolled as the school's first student on October 1, 1872 at the Preston and Olin Building to officially mark the beginning of the "Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College". Mic enrolled several hours after Addison. School president, Charles Minor and the faculty, including James Henry Lane, Charles Martin, Gray Carroll, and Shepherd were on hand to welcome the school's first students. Caldwell, had received a scholarship from his county's school superintendent, The scholarship covered tuition ($30), college fees ($10), and barracks fee ($5/month).
In a letter to General Joseph R. Anderson, a member of the school's Board of Visitors, President Minor wrote: "We have now thirty students matriculated, ... our beginning is to be smaller than had been expected." Minor also described the new students as "plain lads for the most part" and largely under-prepared, forcing the faculty to review high school, and even grammar school material. The total enrollment increased to 132 students by the end of the first school year.
College years.
Caldwell attended V.A.M.C. from 1872 to 1876, taking an extra year to complete the three-year program in agriculture. His brother, Mic was enrolled in 1872, 73, 76, and 1877. Their younger brother, Frank B., enrolled from 1874 to 1877. Neither Frank, nor Mic graduated.
All students lived a military lifestyle and were members of what is now known as the Corps of Cadets. In 1872, cadets were assigned to either A or B company and wore standard uniforms of gray pants jackets and hats with black trim. General James Henry Lane, a former Confederate General, was the school's first Commandant of Cadets. Caldwell attained the rank of second sergeant of VAMC's Company B in his final year.
According to Caldwell's 1875 report card, he excelled in written composition, military tactics, and farm work. He was above average in natural history, French, chemistry, and composition/rhetoric and "tolerable" or worse in mathematics and bookkeeping. His other courses during his four years at VAMC most likely included: English grammar, geography with map drawing, descriptive astronomy, penmanship, free-hand drawing, lectures on physiology and hygiene, habits and manners, and lectures on agricultural and mechanical arts.
In 1872, Caldwell joined the Maury Literary society, which became two separate societies in 1873: the Lee Literary Society and the Maury Literary Society. Both groups focused on writing, public speaking and debate and together they founded the school's first publication, "The Gray Jacket" in 1875.
William Addison Caldwell graduated with V.A.M.C.'s second class on August 9, 1876. Gen. J. H. Williams of Winchester delivered the annual commencement address. The graduating class held an alumni meeting and elected Caldwell as secretary of the alumni association of the class of 1876 .
Post Graduation.
Caldwell became a school teacher in Craig County shortly after graduating. By 1887, he was an office clerk at Norfolk and Western Railway in Roanoke, Virginia, where he was described as a "well-known and popular employee". In 1898, Caldwell moved to Wilmington, North Carolina and worked as a salesman for several large wholesale firms on the wharf, including the Stove Company, Mr. W.B. Cooper, Messrs. Blair &amp; Haly, and the C.C. Covington Company.
In Caldwell's absence, his parents, brother, Mic, and sisters, Grace and Nell sold the farm in Sinking Creek and moved to Radford, VA. He visited them in the summer months.
Health issues and death.
Sometime before 1910, Caldwell's health declined, and he had surgery for a brain tumor. He stayed at the family home in Radford to recover. In the spring of 1910, he returned to Wilmington, N. C. on his doctor's recommendation that salt air would be good for him. He became a clerk at the Tangmoore Hotel in Wrightsville Beach on June 1, 1910. In a letter to his niece, Caldwell wrote that it was "a fine place" but he would prefer to be in Radford and couldn't tell if the salt air was helpful or not.
On June 19, Caldwell fainted and fell, suffering a head injury. He died on June 29, 1910 in a hospital in Wilmington and was buried in the Caldwell family cemetery in Radford On July 1, 1910.
Legacy.
William Addison Caldwell is an icon for the university. His epic hike to enroll as the school's very first student is commemorated in many ways:

Tribosystem

A tribosystem is a tribological system that consists of at least two contacting bodies and any environmental factor that affects their interaction. Tribologists study tribological systems in detail, and devise tribological test procedures.
Definition.
According to ASTM G40-17, a tribosystem is "any system that contains one or more triboelements, including all mechanical, chemical, and environmental factors relevant to tribological behavior." Here, "triboelement" refers to "one of two or more solid bodies that comprise a sliding, rolling, or abrasive contact, or a body subjected to impingement or cavitation."
More simply speaking, a tribosystem is a tribological system that consists of at least two contacting bodies, including the environment in which the interaction takes place. The complete description of a tribosystem includes all relevant factors that govern the tribological behavior of the system. Thus, depending on the aim of the tribological analysis, the tribosystem boundary is flexible and can be drawn more or less widely.
Describing Tribosystems.
The description of tribosystems is based on a detailed assessment of relevant system inputs, outputs and losses, as well as an overall description of the system structure. The following table gives an overview. 
Relevance.
The complete description of a tribosystem is the first step when devising a tribological test procedure. Since tribological tests are often carried out on simplified model systems using standardized tribometers, a complete description of the tribosystem allows for tribological testing across different scales.
For example, if the tribological analysis aims to investigate a specific gear contact in a complex gearbox, exact knowledge of tribological inputs allows tribologists to devise a simplified test setup involving two gears only. Conversely, if the analysis aims to develop a new lubricant formulation for gearbox applications, a rough description of the gearbox-tribosystem allows to reduce testing to relevant system inputs. Thus, detailed knowledge of the tribosystem can significantly reduce the development effort for machines and lubricants.

March 6–8, 2018 nor'easter

The March 6–8, 2018 nor'easter was a powerful nor'easter that wreaked havoc on the Northeastern United States just days after another intense nor'easter struck the Mid-Atlantic, hampering recovery efforts from that storm. Forming on March 2 and reaching the Outer Banks late on March 6, as the end phase of a long-tracked winter storm across the country, it rapidly deepened off the Mid-Atlantic coast on March 7 and brought up to of heavy snow, whiteout conditions, and even coastal flooding (though nowhere near the levels seen in the prior nor'easter) to those in the impact zone from the storm, many of whom were still without power from the previous storm less than a week prior.
The storm caused up to 1 million people to lose power, and at least two people were confirmed dead due to the storm by March 7. Hundreds of flights were cancelled across the region, and many schools closed due to the nor'easter, although some opted to remain open, such as those in New York City, causing controversy. Many freeways were also closed in the regions, and several states were put under state of emergencies.
Meteorological history.
While the previous nor'easter hammered the Northeastern U.S. on March 2–3, another winter storm had begun developing in the western part of the country, dumping very heavy snow in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This storm moved into the Upper Midwest over the next few days and became an intense snowstorm for the affected areas. By early on March 6, the system had reached the Great Lakes, with the surface low beginning to weaken. As it did so, energy began to be transferred over to a new area of low pressure that was forming near the Outer Banks late that day. As the new low began to rapidly intensify, the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) began issuing storm summaries on the intensifying low off the coast of New Jersey early on March 7. A sharp transition of heavy snow to rain was observed near the Jersey Shore, due to warm air aloft pushing slightly inland, with the cold air residing just inland. Thundersnow and snowfall rates of up to an hour were reported in areas around the New York metropolitan area, signaling the rapid intensification of the storm. Late in the afternoon, an eye-like feature was spotted near the center of the storm. The pressure bottomed out at around the same time.
After peaking, the system began to gradually weaken as it continued moving northeastwards towards the Canadian Maritimes late on March 7–8, while heavy snowfall fell around the areas near Boston, Massachusetts. Turning northwestward slightly, moderate snowfall continued to occur over the coastal and interior sections of New England. The low continued to spin down throughout the day, with snow tapering off in much of the region except for the northern parts of New York and far northern New England. By 15:00 UTC the next day, the system had weakened to the point where the WPC terminated storm summaries on the winter storm. It dissipated shortly afterwards.
Preparations and impact.
Mid-Atlantic states.
Amtrak operated a modified schedule along the Northeast Corridor on March 7 due to the storm. About 2,500 flights were cancelled and several schools were closed in the Northeast United States on March 7 because of the upcoming storm.
North Carolina.
The storm caused coastal flooding along the Outer Banks, with North Carolina Highway 12 closed between Rodanthe and the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge.
Maryland and Delaware.
Several schools in Maryland were closed due to snow. The storm caused flooding along some streets in Annapolis. Flooding from high tides was also seen in some communities along the Chesapeake Bay including Cambridge, Crisfield, and Deal Island. In Delaware, the Delaware Memorial Bridge was temporarily closed due to several tractor-trailers being disabled. It was re-opened a few hours later after the vehicles were removed. The Delaware General Assembly cancelled its session for March 7 while the University of Delaware closed at noon on March 7.
Pennsylvania.
In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Wolf declared a state of emergency for several counties in the eastern part of the state. A snow emergency went into effect for the city of Philadelphia on the morning of March 7. Several municipalities in the Philadelphia area declared snow emergencies and many schools and government offices were closed on March 7. Many attractions in the Philadelphia area either closed early or were closed for the entire day on March 7. SEPTA modified their service plan for March 7 due to the snow, with Regional Rail trains running on a modified Saturday schedule and Broad Street Line and Market-Frankford Line trains running during the overnight hours. In addition, several SEPTA bus routes were placed on detours in advance of the storm. On the afternoon of March 7, SEPTA suspended most of their bus services due to the snow. At the Philadelphia International Airport, a ground stop was issued in place. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation implemented speed restrictions of on several freeways in the southeastern part of the state while the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission reduced the speed limit to on portions of the Pennsylvania Turnpike and the Northeast Extension (Interstate 476) in the Philadelphia area. High-profile vehicles such as empty trucks, motorcycles, and recreational vehicles were banned along several Interstate Highways in eastern Pennsylvania due to the storm.
New Jersey.
In New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency and state offices were closed on March 7. New Jersey Transit suspended bus service statewide on the afternoon of March 7, with trains running an abbreviated schedule. More than 322,000 customers in the state were without power, including people who had lost power from a prior storm on March 2. Newark Liberty International Airport was closed briefly during the afternoon of March 7, with limited service soon resuming. The storm forced the closure of the Burlington-Bristol Bridge over the Delaware River. Thundersnow was seen in the state, with lightning striking a teacher in Manchester Township, who suffered injuries and was in stable condition. Snowmobiles had to be sent out to rescue travelers on Interstate 280 and Interstate 78 who had become stuck in the snow during the storm, some who had been trapped for over five hours. About 500 vehicles were reported to have gotten stuck during the incident.
New York.
In New York City, the exceptionally heavy snow made travel difficult, with ferry service suspended. Central Park reported 3.2 inches, while JFK International Airport reported only 2.8 inches, which was much less than many of the forecasts, which suggested that 1–2 feet of snow would fall. However, there was a very sharp gradient in snow totals, with Franklin Lakes, NJ, just under 20 miles away from Central Park, reporting a total of 24.8 inches. In North White Plains, 10 people were taken to the hospital with carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator running inside their home. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a travel ban for tractor-trailers along the New York State Thruway between New York City and Syracuse. Classes were cancelled until March 9 at Binghamton University due to the storm. Many schools in the Lower Hudson Valley closed for the fifth time in a row, eliminating most of the districts’ spring breaks (from Friday, March 2 to Thursday, March 8). Putnam County issued a State Of Emergency, closing all school districts in the county on Thursday, March 8.
New England.
Connecticut.
In Connecticut, Governor Dannel Malloy sent nonessential state employees home early on March 7 ahead of the anticipated heavy snow. At the height of the storm, over 160,000 residents were without electricity. New Fairfield had the greatest accumulation in the state with of snow.
Massachusetts.
In Boston, several shuttle bus routes were cancelled for the rest of the week due to the storm. Crews worked to secure a seawall in Duxbury that was damaged by a prior storm on March 2. After the storm had passed, on March 8, a commuter train slid off the tracks in Wilmington after it struck a tree that was lodged into the tracks. No one was injured in the incident.
The Harvard Sailing Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts partially sank into the Charles River during the nor'easter. The building was compromised due to a failure of the flotation device used to keep the structure afloat.

"Mickey" is a song by American rapper Lil Yachty featuring Offset and Lil Baby. It was released as the 12th track off of Yachty's second studio album "Lil Boat 2". The track peaked at number seven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart and at number 79 on the Canadian Hot 100.
Background.
The song is one of two tracks featuring Offset on "Lil Boat 2": the other one is "Baby Daddy", which also has a feature from Lil Pump.
TikTok challenge.
A TikTok challenge based on the song went viral. The challenge features a person sitting down and then being pulled away. It is based around the lyric on the song by Offset, "Trappin' out the back street / Runnin' through the packs like a track meet (Zoom)", with the "Zoom" adlib being supplied by Lil Yachty. The challenge was deemed dangerous after multiple videos surfaced of children doing the challenge and being violently pulled off-screen.
Critical reception.
The track received lukewarm reviews. Yoh Phillips of "DJBooth" said he "really enjoyed Lil Baby, but Offset and Yachty left me wanting more", also adding "if Yachty’s production was a person, they would probably be in custody for unlawful acts".

Hidden (2018 TV series)

Hidden () is a Welsh television drama serial, created by Mark Andrew and Ed Talfan. It was initially broadcast in Welsh on the Welsh-language channel S4C under its Welsh name "Craith". The bilingual version of the series, under the English name "Hidden", was broadcast on BBC One Wales and BBC Four. Two series have aired, in 2018 and 2019, with a third one due to be broadcast in 2021.
Overview.
Leading actress Sian Reese-Williams commented that the series was more of a "personal drama" than a crime series, because of the multiple human stories involved, including those of the victims, the families of the victims, and the criminal protagonist.
Filming and release.
Filming took place in 2017 in Bangor and Snowdonia. The series was the second project on which Andrew and Talfan collaborated, following "Hinterland". It was first broadcast as "Craith", in Welsh, on S4C on 7 January 2018 and aired weekly. A bi-lingual version of the series aired, mainly in English, on BBC One Wales and BBC Four in June 2018 under the title of "Hidden".
"Hidden" was renewed for a second series in February 2019. It broadcast first on S4C on 17 November 2019.
In January 2021, the BBC announced that a third series had been commissioned to air later in the year, with Sian Reese-Williams and Siôn Alun Davies returning in their roles of, respectively, DCI Cadi John and DS Owen Vaughan. The number of episodes comprising the series was unspecified. 
Episodes.
Airdates listed as per the S4C broadcast. English subtitled repeats were broadcast at 22:30 on Fridays. The English version aired six months later on BBC Four on Saturday nights.
Reception.
"The Guardian" compared "Hidden" favourably to the Swedish Scandi-noir drama "The Bridge", describing it as one of the "current powerhouse run of Wales-set dramas", with "scenes in Welsh to provide that sweet Nordic subtitles hit". It went on to say "Hidden is perhaps the most confidently stylish and stylised yet. As well as a gorgeously gothic credits sequence, it features handsomely brooding landscapes, offbeat interior locations that go far beyond the usual bland corridors/offices of cop drama, and an ominous, skin-prickling soundtrack skilfully employed to heighten the sense of dread."

Leitra, Corlough

Leitra () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Leitra is bounded on the north by Corlough townland, on the west by Corrachomera townland, on the south by Cartronnagilta townland and on the east by Cornacleigh townland. Its chief geographical features are the River Blackwater, County Cavan, mountain streams and spring wells. Leitra is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 83 statute acres.
History.
In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land.
Lowther Kirkwood of Mullinagrave, parish of Templeport, Co. Cavan, gentleman made the following will:
A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Letera" and the owner as "The Lord Primate", the lessee as Mr. Kirkwood" and the tenant as Patrick Grace.
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1826 list eleven tithepayers in the townland.
The Leitra Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 64 being 34 males and 30 females. There were eight houses in the townland of which one was uninhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 45 being 26 males and 19 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were six houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists six landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 27, being 16 males and 11 females. There were five houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
In 1871 the population of the townland was 38, being 19 males and 19 females. There were seven houses in the townland and all were inhabited. (page 296 of census)
In 1881 the population of the townland was 36, being 24 males and 12 females. There were six houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1891 the population of the townland was 38, being 23 males and 15 females. There were six houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are six families listed in the townland.
In the 1911 census of Ireland, there are six families listed in the townland.

Daniel Bushnell

Daniel Bushnell (1808–1891) was an American industrialist and one of the original shareholders of the Standard Oil Company.
Early life.
Daniel Bushnell was born in New York City in 1808 to Alexander Bushnell (1771–1838) and Sarah Wells (1772–1849). In 1813, Bushnell's father Alexander, a ship carpenter, moved his family from New York to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Career.
In 1839, Daniel Bushnell entered the coal business in Pennsylvania, shipping coal from remote areas up the Monongahela River to population centers downstream. Previously, traders had thought that the cost in coal of using a steamboat to bring coal to ports down the Ohio river would exceed the amount of coal that a steamboat could deliver. In June 1845, however, Bushnell showed that towing coal down the Ohio was actually quite profitable, delivering 2,000 bushels of coal to Cincinnati on his tugboat, the "Walter Forward." In 1851 Bushnell built another towboat, the "Black Diamond," which was used to ship even more coal from the Pennsylvania mines to ports along the region's rivers. Bushnell hired the Captain J.J Vandergrift to captain his steamboats, and soon the two men were shipping coal as far as New Orleans. Bushnell's innovation brought about a boom in the Pennsylvania coal business, spurring growth in Pittsburgh and the surrounding towns. Bushnell also owned and operated a number of coal mines of his own, including the Hodgson Mine (opened 1843) and the Bushnell mine (opened 1840), both outside of Pittsburgh. In 1861 Bushnell left the coal business and began trading oil along the Allegheny River. Working with his sons Joseph, Thomas, John and Robert, as well as his old colleague Captain Vandergrift, Bushnell and his partners made a fortune by buying oil at the Venango oil wells and shipping it down the Allegheny River to Pittsburgh. The Bushnell family's oil operations were soon bought out by John D. Rockefeller's growing oil company in exchange for shares in Rockefeller's firm. As a result, Bushnell became one of the 37 original Standard Oil shareholders, owning 97 shares in 1878 (compared to Rockefeller's nearly 9,000). Daniel Bushnell died in Pittsburgh on July 12, 1891, leaving his large fortune to his seven surviving children.
Personal life.
Daniel Bushnell first married Eleanor Gray (1811–1854), with whom he had 14 children. His second wife was Elizabeth Hill, with whom Bushnell had three more children. One of Bushnell's daughters, Sarah Wells Bushnell, married another Standard Oil shareholder, William Gray Warden. Sarah and William Warden's daughter Mary Warden Harkness (1864–1916) was a philanthropist and the wife of Standard Oil heir Charles W. Harkness. Another one of Bushnell's granddaughters, Eleanor Bushnell Davis, married the engineer Morris Llewellyn Cooke. American intelligence officer Peter Ashmun Ames and novelist Joseph Bushnell Ames were Daniel's great-grandsons through his son Joseph. Daniel Bushnell's brother was the Reverend Wells Bushnell (1799–1863), a prominent Presbyterian minister.

Kaye Wellings

Kaye Wellings is an active Sexual and Reproductive Health educator and has worked within this field of study for over 20 years. She has a strong interest in evaluation research, particularly in relation to preventive intervention and has assessed major national and international sexual health programmes, including AIDS preventive strategies in European countries and the English government's Teenage Pregnancy Strategy. Much of her working life has been spent researching sensitive topics, including not only sexual behaviour but also risk practices relating to drug use and in prison populations and the taboo of birth contraceptives in her early years.
Early and current career.
After graduation, Wellings moved to London as a public health and social scientist. For some time, Wellings worked in journalism with journal New Society until continuing on to work with the Family Planning Association in health policy research. The next few years brought on the continuing HIV/AIDS epidemic in which Wellings monitored responses amongst the public as Senior Research Officer at the Health Education Authority (HEA). There was some conflict with methods used to handle and distribute research to the media, where Wellings and other researchers had one idea of presentation while politicians had another. “My experience there made me seek a safe haven in academia, where I could tell the story as it was, without having to suppress data or manipulate angles”, states Wellings.
Currently, Wellings is a Professor of Sexual and Reproductive Health Research at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and co-leader of the third British National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles.
Wellings has co-written several research papers describing trends and current patterns in sexual practices with opposite-sex partners among men and women aged 16–24 years in Britain, noting that more and younger people are participating in sexual practices in more diverse ways.
Accomplishments.

Betting on horse racing

Betting on horse racing or horse betting commonly occurs at many horse races. It started in the UK in the early 1600s during the reign of King James I. Gamblers can stake money on the final placement of the horses taking part in a race. Gambling on horses is, however, prohibited at some racetracks. For example, because of a law passed in 1951, betting is illegal in Springdale Race Course, home of the nationally renowned Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank) Carolina Cup and Colonial Cup Steeplechase in Camden, South Carolina.
Where gambling is allowed, most tracks offer parimutuel betting where gamblers' money is pooled and shared proportionally among the winners once a deduction has been made from the pool. Parimutuel betting also provides purse money to participants and a considerable amount of tax revenue, with over $100 billion being wagered annually in 53 countries.
In some countries – notably the UK, Ireland, and Australia – an alternative and more popular facility is provided by bookmakers who effectively make a market in odds. This allows the gambler to 'lock in' odds on a horse at a particular time (known as 'taking the price' in the UK).
Types of bets.
In North American racing, the three most common ways to bet money are to "win", to "place", and to "show". A bet to "win", sometimes called a "straight" bet, means staking money on the horse, and if it comes in first place, the bet is a winner. In a bet to "place", you are betting on your horse to finish either first or second. A bet to "show" wins if the horse finishes first, second or third. Since it is much easier to select a horse to finish first, second, or third than it is to select a horse just for first, the show payoffs will be much lower on average than win payoffs. If there are a small number of horses in the race, "show" or "place" bets may not be offered (or if bets have already been made, they are cancelled and the wagered amounts refunded).
In Europe, Australia, and Asia, betting to "place" is different since the number of "payout places" varies depending on the size of the field that takes part in the race. For example, in a race with seven or less runners in the UK, only the first two finishers would be considered winning bets with most bookmakers. Three places are paid for eight or more runners, whilst a handicap race with 16 runners or more will see the first four places being classed as "placed". (A "show" bet in the North American sense does not exist in these locations.)
The term "each-way" (E/W) bet is used everywhere but North America, and has a different meaning depending on the location. An "each-way" bet sees the total bet being split in two, with half being placed on the win, and half on the place. Bettors receive a payout if the horse either wins, and/or is placed based on the place criteria as stated above. The full odds are paid if the horse wins, (plus the place portion), with a quarter or a fifth of the odds (depending on the race-type and the number of runners) if only the place section of the bet is successful. In the UK some bookmakers will pay for the first five (some independent firms have even paid the first six) for a place on the Grand National. This additional concession is offered because of the large number of runners in the race (maximum 40). Occasionally other handicap races with large fields (numbers of runners) receive the same treatment from various bookmakers, especially if they are sponsoring the race.
The rough equivalent of the "each-way" in North America is the "across the board" ("win/place/show") or "win/place" bet, where equal bets on a horse are made to "win", "place", and "show" (or just "win" and "place"). Each portion is treated by the totalizator as a separate bet, so an "across-the-board" bet is merely a convenience for bettors and parimutuel clerks. For instance, if a $2 across-the-board bet (total outlay of $6) were staked on a horse which finished second, paying $4.20 to place and $3.00 to show, the bettor would receive $7.20 on what is essentially a $6 wager.
In addition to straight wagers, "exotic" wagers offer bettors an opportunity to incorporate the placement of different horses in one or multiple races. The two broad types of exotic wagers are horizontal and vertical. Horizontal exotic wagers are bets on multiple horses in one particular race, while vertical exotic wagers involve predicting results across multiple races. Both have specific options for which bets are available and are detailed below.
In the most basic horizontal wager, an "exacta", the bettor selects the first and second place horses in the exact order. Picking the first three finishers in exact order is called a "trifecta" and a "superfecta" refers to the specific finishing order of the top four horses.
Boxing is a tactic that increases the odds of winning an exotic wager by removing the need to choose the exact order. A "quinella", which boxes an "exacta" (allowing the first two finishers to come in any order and still win), is the basic box, but boxing can be applied to the "trifecta" and "superfecta" as well.
A "wheel" is a bet on a single horse is to finish in a specific position, with multiple horses finishing ahead and/or behind it. In a sense, a win bet can be thought of as a specific type of "wheel" bet.
Vertical bets are spread over different races. A "daily double" is an exotic wager placed on the winner of two consecutive races. Picking the winner of three, four, five or six straight races is referred to as a "pick-3", "pick-4", "pick-5" and "pick-6" respectively.
Betting exchanges.
In addition to traditional betting with a bookmaker, punters (bettors) are able to both back and lay money on an online betting exchange. Punters who lay the odds are in effect acting as a bookmaker. The odds of a horse are set by the market conditions of the betting exchange which is dictated to by the activity of the members.
United States.
In the United States, the states with the largest pools are California, New York, Kentucky, Florida, Maryland and Illinois in no particular order.
Betting on horse racing in the United States varies from state to state. By the late 19th century over 300 tracks were in operation in the country but those opposed to gambling caused the banning of bookmakers and horse racing at the beginning of the next century. In 1908 pari-mutuel (tote) betting was introduced, helping the industry to prosper and that has continued to be the case to the present day. Pari-mutuel betting is currently legal in 32 US states. Due to new legislation horse race betting in the US could change significantly in the near future. The legal market handle on horse racing in the United States in 2018 was $11.26 billion while experts predict the illegal sports betting market could be anywhere from $80 billion to $150 billion annually.
Kentucky Derby.
Run on the first Saturday in May the most famous horse race in the United States, the Kentucky Derby, takes place at Churchill Downs and is known as ‘The Run For The Roses.’ The one mile two furlong contest dates back to 1875. $149.9 million was wagered on the race in 2019, beating the previous record amount of $139.2 set 12 months earlier. $24.6 million of that total was gambled online.
Hong Kong.
Hong Kong generates the largest horse racing revenue in the world and is home to some of the largest horse betting circles including the Hong Kong Jockey Club founded in 1884. In 2009, Hong Kong generated an average US$12.7 million in gambling turnover per race 6 times larger than its closest rival France at US$2 million while the United States only generated $250,000. Betting on horse racing is ingrained in local culture and is seen as an investment.
During the 2014-2015 racing season the Hong Kong Jockey Club attracted about HK$138.8 million (US$17.86 million) per race more that any other track in the world. The revenue the club generate from various wagers makes it the largest taxpayer for the government. Hong Kong Jockey Club broke its own record during the 2016-2017 season with a turnover of HK$216.5 billion and paid the government HK$21.7 billion in duty and profits tax, an all-time high.
Australia.
A government survey in 2015 found that nearly one million Australians (5.6% of Australian adults) gambled on dog or horse racing in Australia. Most were men aged between 30 and 64 who had a typical yearly expenditure of $1,300 on race betting. Nationally, typical annual race-betting expenditure amounted to roughly $1.27 billion.
Horse race betting in New South Wales (NSW) is conducted by bookmakers (at race meetings and via telephone) and Tabcorp (tote betting at racecourses and through various retail outlets including the internet). In 2014 it was estimated that $300 million alone was bet on Australia’s most famous race - the Melbourne Cup.
United Kingdom.
Betting on horse racing in the UK is wide and varied. Unlike most other countries where the pari-mutuel system is in operation the UK’s version - the Tote - accounts for only a small percentage (in the region of 5%) of the total betting turnover. Between April 2017 and March 2018 off-course horse racing betting turnover in Great Britain amounted to £4.3 billion. The majority of the money wagered on horse racing in the UK is with bookmakers, either in betting shops or online. In 2018 there were 8.5 thousand betting shops in Great Britain. This figure is expected to decrease significantly in 2019 when government restrictions on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBT’s) comes into force.

2Fort

"2Fort" is a multiplayer map for the first-person shooter games "Quake World Team Fortress", "Team Fortress Classic" and "Team Fortress 2", and for the multiplayer total conversion modification Fortress Forever. Consisting of two similar buildings separated by a short bridge and a moat, each team must fight their way into the opposing team's building and capture their flag/intelligence from an underground base concealed beneath. A launch map for "Team Fortress 2", 2Fort was critically praised as an iconic map for the series and one of the best first-person shooter maps of all time.
Level design.
2Fort is an almost perfectly symmetrical map, with each team's intelligence located in an underground fortress beneath the two buildings. The design allows players to "come together and battle it out along the center bridge". The map is designed so that each class can take a different tactical approach, such as Heavies and Medics fighting along the bridge while Spies can attempt to sneak through the sewers. The layout of the map remained largely untouched between "Team Fortress" and its sequel.
Development.
According to Charlie Brown, the project lead of "Team Fortress 2", the development team found it "tough to settle on a plausible environmental excuse" for having both teams in such close proximity to each other on maps like 2Fort. While initially considering space, they found "space marines" to be an overused trope. They decided to make the game have an "iconic" setting based on "'60s spy-meets-sci-fi movies", so that "sense-making isn't necessary". The map was designed to look deceptive, with "neither teams’ façades [being] nearly as high-tech as what's underneath". Hints of high-tech elements were disguised within the map, such as secret video cameras, or making cows actually be wooden billboards. Overall, the interior of each team's base in 2Fort was designed to look like "a command center or NORAD-style space".
In 2009, the map source files of 2Fort, among other maps, was released by Valve to allow for easier modding. For the 2015 Invasion Update, the community-created "2Fort Invasion" map was added to the game, remodeling the map to look like it was being invaded by aliens.
Reception.
Alex Walker of "Kotaku" called 2Fort one of the best first-person shooter multiplayer maps of all time, calling it an "absolute classic", and citing its design which allows every class to "contribute in some meaningful way". Shacknews called the map memorable due to the numerous servers hosting unending 2Fort games, which "became TF2's greatest charm", allowing teams to socialize with each other, and giving people "a magical place to unwind and just relax", a casual place to practice with the team's classes rather than worrying about capturing the intelligence.
"PCGamesN" called 2Fort a "fan favorite" map that "was awful if you wanted rounds that lasted under an hour", its design elements contributing to stalemates that made it a good place to socialize, and criticizing "Overwatch" for a lack of "low energy" social spaces by comparison. Nick Breckon of Shacknews agreed that the map's design resulted in "long, drawn-out stalemates", due to the location of the intelligence point beneath the enemy's spawn room. Robo Panda Z of "Destructoid" said that "nothing epitomizes the multiplayer experience for me more than this map", calling 2Fort a "Capture the flag grind-fest" and an "eternal stalemate broken by the closest of teamwork", while praising the addition of a roof to the bridge in the "Team Fortress 2" version. He stated that while "there are maps in "TFC" and "TF2" I like considerably better than 2Fort [...] it is the absolute essence of a Capture the flag map, as well as a perfect example of how to improve on a design."
Steve Hogarty of "PC Zone" commented on how familiar 2Fort was to players of "Team Fortress Classic" upon the release of "Team Fortress 2", saying that "even if you'd already been told it was a remade version of the popular "Team Fortress Classic" map [...] its layout already exists as a semi-familiar strategy map in the back of your mind". He noted that "strategically, it remains almost completely unchanged", and that there was "an eerie sense of "déjà vu"" for "fans of the original game".

Ethel H. Bailey

Ethel H. Bailey (18 August 1896 - 5 July 1985) was an American mechanical engineer who began her working life in aviation and went on to develop radar and spectroscopic equipment. She was called a 'trailblazer' by fellow engineer Margaret Ingels in a 1952 speech. Bailey was a member of the American Automotive Society (the first woman to be admitted as a full member, in 1926), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Society of American Military Engineers, and the National Society of Professional Engineers. She was also a member of the British Women's Engineering Society and contributed to their journal, "The Woman Engineer".
Early life.
Ethel H. Bailey was born on 18 August 1896 in Houlton, Maine, USA, to Walter and Anna Bailey (née Sanders). She had one sister, Margaret (b. 1889).
Education.
Bailey had been interested in radios and motorboats at high school, and during the First World War she became an assistant inspector of Liberty L-12 aeroplane engines for the U.S. government, at a test airfield in Indianapolis. After the war she studied at the Michigan State Automobile School in Detroit in 1918, and George Washington University in 1920.
Career.
In 1920, Bailey joined the staff of the Society of Automotive Engineers as a research engineer and became the organisation's first full female member in 1926. In June 1925 she published a paper in "The Woman Engineer" journal entitled '"A Ternary Alloy Bearing Metal (The Development of a Material of Unusual Wearing Qualities)"'.
In September 1925 she travelled to Paris where she visited Marie Curie at her home. She then travelled to London, where she represented the Society of Automotive Engineers at the very first International Conference of Women in Science, Industry and Commerce organised by Caroline Haslett and the Women's Engineering Society during the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley. She spoke on 'Automotive Research' undertaken by the SAE, speaking alongside physical chemist Isabel Hadfield and electrical engineer Margaret Partridge. She was also credited as part of the Advisory Committee for the high profile conference.
In 1929, Bailey wrote an appreciation of Katharine Wright Haskell (1874 – 1929) the sister, supporter and business manager of aviation pioneers Wilbur and Orville Wright, for the American magazine "Airway Age", and reproduced in the British "The Woman Engineer" journal. She ended the article with "Orville the Flyer, Wilbur the Adviser and Katharine the Inspirer".
In 1929 she moved to a new job at the General Electric Co.’s Bloomfield works.
During the Second World War Bailey worked procuring radar equipment at the Signal Corps Radar Laboratory, and went on to organize radar equipment for the U.S. Navy, as a mechanical engineer at the Raytheon Manufacturing Company in Waltham, Massachusetts. In 1945 she was director of the technical publications division of a printing company in Boston, Massachusetts. She went on to be research assistant at the Department of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, developing spectroscopic equipment
Death.
Ethel H Bailey died on 5 July 1985 in Concord, Massachusetts, USA, at the age of 88, and was buried in Farmington, Maine, USA.

Brad Davison

Brad Davison (born April 22, 1999) is an American college basketball player for the Wisconsin Badgers of the Big Ten Conference. Davison attended Maple Grove High School where he played basketball and football. He was named to the Big Ten All-Freshman Team after averaging 12.1 points per game.
High school career.
Davison attended Maple Grove High School and played both basketball and football. He played as a quarterback on the football field and led the Crimson to an 8–3 record as a senior. He led the West Metro South subdistrict in passing with 2,418 yards and 23 touchdowns, completing 62.9 percent of his throws. Davison finished second in the subdistrict in rushing with 891 yards and 15 scores. Davison was named 2016 Star Tribune Metro Player of the Year. He completed 43 career touchdown passes and rushed for 25 touchdowns. Throughout his career under center, Davison led Maple Grove to three state tournament appearances and a 27–7 record.
On the basketball court, Davison was a four-year starter and captain and earned All-Conference honors during all four of his years playing. He averaged 21.2 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 7.3 assists per game as a junior in leading Maple Grove to a 25–5 record and a state tournament berth. He was named to the Star Tribune All-Metro First Team as a junior. As a senior, he led the team to a 28–4 record and state tournament appearance and was a finalist for Minnesota's Mr. Basketball. Davison earned a spot on USA Today's Minnesota All-State Team after averaging 24.4 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.9 assists and 4.2 steals per game. He finished his career at Maple Grove as the school's all-time leader in points (2,300), assists (899) and steals (365). He was ranked the 119 recruit in his class by Rivals.com and committed to playing basketball at Wisconsin on July 11, 2016, choosing the Badgers over offers from Minnesota, Michigan, Butler, Stanford and Northwestern.
College career.
Davison scored 20 points on December 9, 2017, in an 82–63 loss to Marquette. On February 25, 2018, Davison scored a career-high 30 points in a 68–63 loss to Michigan State. Davison finished as Wisconsin's second-leading scorer as a freshman, averaging 12.1 points per game while shooting 81.8 percent from the free throw line and making a team-high 60 shots from the three-point range. Davison earned a spot on the Big Ten’s All-Freshman team. He sustained numerous shoulder injuries throughout the course of his freshman season, resulting in successful offseason left shoulder surgery. During his freshman season, the Wisconsin men's basketball team missed the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 20 years and finished with a 15–18 record and 9th in the Big Ten Conference. The team saw their season end following a loss to the Michigan State Spartans in the Big Ten Tournament on March 2, 2018.
Davison began his sophomore season in a slump, hitting 10–for–35 (28.6 percent) of his shots in his first 10 games. In a 12-game stretch in the middle of the season, Davison shot much better, hitting 29–for–53 (54.7 percent) of his three-pointers. He finished the season in a slump as well, going 13–for–61 (21.3 percent) in his final 12 games. He averaged 10.5 points per game as a sophomore, shooting 34.9 percent from beyond the arc. Davison was an Academic All-Big Ten honoree. He dealt with a foot and ankle injury throughout the season, often wearing a protective boot after games. He gained a reputation from opposing fan bases for receiving flagrant fouls and tripping players, something Wisconsin coach Greg Gard attributed to Davison playing extremely hard. Davison also received attention for excessive flopping, and the NCAA rule to combat it was informally called "the Brad Davison rule."
As a junior, Davison became the team's emotional leader with the departure of Ethan Happ. During a three-game stretch in November and December 2019, Davison shot 3–of–20 as Wisconsin lost all three games. He scored 14 points and hit the game-winning three-pointer with 9.1 seconds remaining in a 56–54 upset of Maryland on January 14, 2020. On January 29, Davison was suspended one game by the Big Ten for a flagrant foul he committed the previous game in which he struck Iowa's Connor McCaffery in the groin. On February 15, Davison tied a career-high with 30 points and his eight three-pointers tied a school record set by Bronson Koenig in an 81–64 win over Nebraska. On February 23, Davison became the 45th player in Wisconsin history to score 1,000 points during a game against Rutgers. Davison averaged 9.9 points and 4.3 rebounds per game as a junior.
As a senior, Davison averaged 10 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 2.4 assists per game. He announced that he would be returning for a fifth season of eligibility, taking advantage of the NCAA's decision regarding athletes who participated in the 2020-21 season.
Personal life.
Davison identifies as a Christian. He has two older sisters, Stephanie and Angie, both of whom played on the Northern Iowa Panthers women's basketball team, graduating in 2016 and 2017 respectively. In high school, Davison achieved a 4.0 GPA and was named the 2017 Scholar-Athlete award from the Minnesota Chapter of the National Football Foundation. He was a member of National Honor Society in high school. Throughout his life, Davison has participated in more than 120 hours of volunteer work, going on service trips to Jamaica and Costa Rica and also at Shriners Prom. Davison was a member of Maple Grove's Fellowship of Christian Athletes and its GOLD program, which feeds impoverished peoples across the world. He is majoring in business management and human resources at Wisconsin.

William Mirtle

William Mirtle (24 December 1739 – c. 1769) was a Scottish mariner and explorer, primarily known for his time with the Bengal Pilot Service (or the Bombay Marine) and the British East India Company. On 22 December 1768, he was granted a coat of arms for “having been on the 7th day of January 1763 taken by a French Squadron cruising off Bengal in the East Indies and by desperate attempt overcoming the crew of the vessel whereon he was prisoner, by which success he regained his liberty and got safe to Calcutta where his critical intelligence of the enemy proved of essential service to the Commerce which the Factory testified by public thanks. After which engaging as a volunteer he served with reputation having likewise had the happiness to succeed in establishing an important fir trade for masts in the interior parts of Bengal with the Mountain Rajas”.
Biography.
Early life.
William Mirtle was born 24 December 1739 to Thomas Mirtle, brewer in Edinburgh, and his wife Jean Rannie. Jean was the niece of Sir David Rannie (1 July 1716 - 17 November 1764), who made a fortune with the East India Company, later returning to Scotland and purchasing Melville Castle.
By 1758, William had followed in his great-uncle's footsteps, and enlisted with the East India Company, serving as a mate on the snow "Speedwell""."
A French fleet at Balasore.
In 1763 the French privateers "Vengeur", "Fidèle", and "Condé", were cruising in Balasore Roads and captured some English ships, which caused a great panic in Calcutta.
At a consultation held at Fort William on 12 January 1763, Peter Amyatt Esq., President and Council of Fort William, informed the Agent Board … “that the Chowky Boat arrived at Town last night at 12 o’clock with William Mirtle on Board, late Mate of the “Speedwell” Snow (under) Captain Ramsay, who brings the following intelligence: Namely, that they were taken on the 7th Instant in 25 fathoms of water by a French Squadron consisting of two Ships &amp; Frigate which is cruising in Balasore &amp; has made besides the following Prizes Vizt. The “Walpole”, bound to Madras, the “Grampus” Pilot Sloop, Mr. Savage Pilot, &amp; a Sloop from Chittagong supposed to be the “Clive”. That he (Mirtle) on the morning of the 9th repossessed himself of the “Speedwell” &amp; was pushing in for the River, but finding he was in danger of being again taken by the French Frigate he took to his Boat with ten Lascars and made his escape.”
In the debate that followed it was decided that several ships should remain at Kedgeree, but that Pilots should be sent aboard them with instructions to sail up the Hooghly River if the enemy attacked, and that twenty sepoys should be detailed to each ship as a further safeguard. It was also decided to send a sloop to cruise off Palmyras Point to warn inbound ships, and that another sloop (well armed and manned) should watch the motions of the French squadron and annoy any boats or sloops they may send into the river.
The only other event of importance during the French squadron’s visit to Balasore was a fight with the East Indiaman "Winchelsea", which escaped after an engagement lasting for two hours.
Fir timber merchant and explorer.
By 1766, William had become a timber collector in the Purnia district, and spent time exploring the interior of India towards the Nepalese border, gaining extensive knowledge of the Hill States of India and of the fir trade there. 
Death and afterward.
In 1769, William Mirtle was deputed to the Morang country to obtain wood for masts, tar, pitch, and turpentine, but he died before completing his mission. On his death, the task was entrusted to Francis Peacock and James Christie.
Hillslap Tower and estate.
The Hillslap (or Hillslope) estate, which was originally known as Calfhill, lies to the northeast of Galashiels, Scotland. This estate remained in the possession of the Cairncross family from 1569 to 1759, when, owing to the death of the sixth and last laird, Hugh Cairncross, without issue, it passed into the hands of descendants of females of the house.
The legal fight for succession took until 1769, and included William Mirtle as one of the claimants. His father, Thomas Mirtle, provided proofs of relation to Alison Cairncross, a daughter of Nicol Cairncross, the second, of Hillslop. These proofs consisted of charges granted by Thomas Martle, the great-grandfather of William Mirtle, to the Cairncross family acknowledging receipt of tocher paid to Thomas Martle with respect to his marriage to Alison Cairncross.
On 9 March 1769, the House of Lords ruled in favour of "William Myrtle, son of the deceased Thomas Myrtle, brewer in Edinburgh" and his other claimants, William Heatly, Thomas Mill, and Alexander Home.
William was in India at the time, and died shortly after his legal victory. The estate soon became the property of Mr. William Patterson, a wealthy tanner in Galashiels.
Honours, decorations, awards, and distinctions.
A grant of Arms and Crest to "William Mirtle of Calcutta in the Kingdom of Bengal, Gentleman, only son of Thomas Mirtle of the City of Edinburgh, deceased, by Jane his wife, daughter of David Rannie of the same city and grandson of William Mirtle", was granted on 22 December 1768 as follows:
"Per fess wavy Gules and Argent in Chief a Lion passant guardant Erminois and in Base on a Mount Vert a Fir-tree proper". "Crest:" "A Dexter Arm Erect encircled by a Myrtle Branch in the Hand a Scimitar proper Pommel and Hilt Gold on the Blade a Shackle severed Sable".
The text of the grant states that Mirtle served more than 10 years in the East India Company.

Loretta Ross

Loretta J. Ross is an African American academic, feminist, and activist who advocates for reproductive justice, especially among women of color. As an activist, Ross has written on reproductive justice activism and the history of African American women.
Early life and education.
Ross was born in Temple, Texas on August 16, 1953, the sixth of eight children in a blended family. Her father, who immigrated from Jamaica, was an Army weapons specialist and drill sergeant. He retired from the military in 1963, worked for the Post Office, and held odd jobs to support his family. Ross' mother worked as a domestic worker and owned a music store, but worked as a housewife while Ross was growing up. For her primary education, Ross attended integrated schools: Army schools through second grade, then public schools. She was double-promoted in elementary grades and was an honors student in high school. Ross' grades were high and she received honors during her school years. She was driven to excel in school so that she could have a good job and not have to do housework like her mother.
In 1964, at 11 years old, Ross was raped by a stranger. Three years later, Ross was raped by her distant cousin. Abortion was not a legal option in 1969, and she became pregnant and gave birth to her only son, Howard. Ross lost her scholarship from Radcliffe College of Harvard University when she decided to keep her son instead of sending him away for adoption. At age 16, she became pregnant again from consensual sex with her first boyfriend. However, abortion was legal in D.C and she was able to have a safe abortion.
In 1970, Ross attended Howard University for her tertiary education after being denied admission to Radcliffe after officials found out about her child. During her undergraduate career there, she became actively involved in black nationalist politics, civil rights movements (i.e. black women feminism ideologies and racial issues), and tenant organizing. Ross joined a Marxist–Leninist discussion group called the D.C. Study Group, and the South Africa Support Project.
In 1976, at age 23, Ross experienced sterilization abuse when she was sterilized with Dalkon Shield. The Daikon Shield was a type of intrauterine device that was marketed despite being found to be defective. The device caused major negative health threats to its users, especially inflicting harm on African American and poor communities. Loretta Ross received the Dakon Shield at Howard University per a health clinic free of charge. This device caused her to develop a pelvic inflammatory disease which she endured for six months. During these six months, her concerns were brushed off. They told her that her problem came from a rare STD from having sex with GI soldiers that had came back from Vietnam. However, she did not know any GIs. After half a year of dealing with her disease brought on by Dakon Shield, she developed a severe infection which resulted in a coma. Her life changed after waking up from the coma - the doctors had performed a total hysterectomy. Ross says that her doctor visited her after she had her operation and wrongly assumed that she would be happy to no longer need the usage of birth controls or deal with menstruation. Ross was among the first women of color to win the lawsuit against the manufacturer of Dalkon Shield, A.H. Robins. This incident has influenced Ross tremendously. She became convinced that her sterilization was a form of population control due to the birth control being given for free at a historically Black college, and became extremely vocal around issues regarding reproductive rights. Because of this experience, she found her passion advocating for reproductive justice and racial politics. In November 1980, the murder of her close friend and political ally, Yolanda Ward, became the turning point in Ross' life as an activist. Yolanda Ward was a cochairwoman of the District's City Wide Housing Coalition. Ward was mysteriously shot and killed in the midst of a street robbery. Ross has referred to this murder as a political assassination.
In 2007, Ross completed her bachelor's degree at Agnes Scott College. Under the direction of professor Elizabeth Hackett, Ross wrote "Just Choices: Women of Color, Reproductive Health and Human Rights," her capstone Women's Studies independent study project at Agnes Scott. She is currently pursuing her PhD in Women's Studies at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.
In 2018, she was hired by Arizona State University to teach a 400-level course on Reproductive Justice, a topic on which she has co-authored three books.
In 2019 she joined the faculty of Smith College as Visiting Associate Professor of the Study of Women &amp; Gender.
Feminism and activism.
Ross has stated that she believes the feminist movement has predominately been led by white women. These women have primarily put their focus on issues such as reproductive choice and abortion rights. Their focused agenda also includes equal pay, birth control access, voting rights, and more. However, this does not include issues that disproportionately affect minorities and women of color. Ross emphasizes social issues such as pervasive poverty and the mass incarceration of reproductive-aged people. She is passionate about these examples of racism that must be highlighted and targeted just as much as the other issues at hand. She also feels as though the fact that these issues aren't addressed is an example of racism in this country itself and demonstrates how deeply embedded it is into our country and its beliefs. These bouts of racism, she believes, are shown in both very obvious and apparent ways while others reveal themselves as microaggressions.
In 1977, Ross and a group of Black and minority activists coined the term "women of color" at the National Women's Conference as a unifying term to address political and social issues. Through this, Ross was able to ensure that all minority women were included in the conversation without insensitivity. For a very long time, the term "colored" was being used, and that word's history with America is extremely unsettling and dehumanizing. Adding the phrase "women of color" into the rhetoric allowed for minorities, especially Black women, to be respectfully discussed in the manner of reproductive justice without sparking any discomfort. The ground that Ross stand on release heavy tones of inclusivity, and the coining of this term further supports that.
Driven by her personal experience as a survivor of sexual assault, in 1979, Ross became the third Executive Director of the D.C. Rape Crisis Center, the first rape crisis center that was primarily run by and geared toward providing resources for women of color. The Rape Crisis Center is an organization that aims to prepare stakeholders in the situation of sexual assault. This is performed through proper training that centers compassion, dignity, and respect. The Rape Crises Center is vocal on the stance that they provide support no matter the demographic of the person seeking assistance, morals that Ross exhibited throughout her career.
In August 1980, Ross, accompanied by others from the DC Rape Crisis Center, organized the First National Conference on Third World Women and Violence in Washington, DC. This was the first conference that brought together women from different racial backgrounds, unifying the participants towards achieving the goal of cultivating a new, holistic network for people of color, both women and men, to advocate for anti-violence activism. There were concerns that not much work would be done because of the mixing of numerous different backgrounds, but because of the work done by Ross and others, the event proved itself to be a great success that allowed for different experiences to be heard and understood from different perspectives.
In 1985, the National Organization for Women (NOW) hired Ross to be the director of the Women of Color Programs to both improve participation by women of color in NOW, create coalitions with organizations focused on issues affecting women of color, and to respond to criticism by women of color who felt mainstream feminist organizations were ignoring issues of race and class. By hiring Ross, a strong voice in the reproductive justice community, they hoped to show their support of issues that are unique to women of color. This partnership allowed for the feminist movement to cross barriers that had not been acknowledged in the mainstream. Ross organized women of color delegations for the pro-choice marches NOW sponsored in 1986 and 1989, and organized the first national conference on Women of Color and Reproductive Rights in 1987.
Ross organized delegations for black women in pro-choice marches that were sponsored by NOW in 1986 and 1989. In response to the Supreme Court's Webster decision in 1989, Ross co-coordinated production of the pathbreaking statement "We Remember: African American Women Are For Reproductive Freedom." This popular brochure was successfully distributed over 250,000 copies. The pamphlet emphasizes the right to have a choice especially as a Black woman in America. The history that Black women and American systems have is not one to be proud of, and this pamphlet connects that with the right to your own body. Eras such as Jim Crow are highlighted highlighting that this struggle is two sided; one being racism and the other being sexism.
As Program Director (1989–90) for the National Black Women's Health Project (now known as the Black Women's Health Imperative), she coordinated the first national conference of African American women for reproductive rights. From 1980 to 1988, she was a member of the D.C. Commission on Women. From 1991 to 1995, Ross was National Program Research Director for the Center for Democratic Renewal (formerly the National Anti-Klan Network), where she directed projects on right-wing organizations in South Africa, Klan and neo-Nazi involvement in anti-abortion violence, and human rights education in the U.S. CDR is a non-profit clearinghouse that provides information on hate groups and violence which include the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi movement. Ross managed the research and program departments and was the director of specific projects. These projects include the human rights education in the U.S, right wing organizations in South Africa, and Klan and neo-Nazi involvement in anti-abortion violence. In addition to her activism in CDR, she produced their quarterly newsletter, "The Monitor", as well as monthly intelligence reports on far right activities,"The Activist Update". In 1996 she created the National Center for Human Rights Education, a training and resource center for grassroots activists aimed at applying a human rights analysis to injustices in the U.S. Active internationally, Ross is a founding member of the International Council of African Women and of the Network of East-West Women. She has been a regular participant in International Women and Health Meetings and helped organize the delegation of 1100 African American women to the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1984. She attended United Nations Women's Conferences in Copenhagen, Nairobi, and Beijing.
In 1997, with Luz Rodriguez and 14 others, Ross co-founded SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective which aims to build an effective network between individuals in advocating improvements within institutional policies that impact the reproductive lives of marginalized communities. Ross served as the National Coordinator for the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective from 2005 until 2012. Some notable contributions of SisterSong include linking Black Lives Matter and reproductive justice, a billboard campaign that included a film titled "Maafa 21", and the collaboration of Planned Parenthood with reproductive justice.
Ross was one of the African American women who first coined the term "reproductive justice," with the aim to frame the pursuit of reproductive justice using the social justice framework. The coining of this term later to the development of the term "reproductive oppression." This term highlighted the connection a pregnant person makes between their decision on what to do about their pregnancy and the happenings of their community. For example, if someone falls pregnant and they are in a community that does not have access to healthcare and witnesses immigration raids often, these factors have to be taken into account. It is another term that further emphasizes that a person's choice is not really a choice when these factors come into question. This is a factor that is also important in domestic abuse issues. Domestic abuse survivors do not get enough support in this country, and whether or not to bring a child into the situation is an extremely important question to ask. The use of this term gives individuals who live this experience a spotlight and a chance to be heard. In 2002, Ross was one of the interviewees featured in the Global Feminism Project archive, which is a project organized under the University of Michigan, compiling interviews of feminist icons from many different countries. In this interview, Ross details her entire background and progress made in the reproductive justice realm. She digs deep into her beginnings and is able to describe the hardships she experienced that set the foundation for the work she ultimately did for not only the country, but for individuals around the world. The primary basis that led her to doing this work was the experiences with sexual assault and pregnancy that she experienced, as well as the forced sterilization that she encountered in her college days. She also discuss conventions she assisted with facilitating and the situations the led to coining phrases such as “reproductive justice” and “women of color;” phrases that are used every day in these conversations. Other hard topics such as organizations’ tendency to be unintentionally racist are explored as she breaks down all of the aspects that go into the way people are treated when it comes to reproductive justice.
Ross acted as National Co-Director for women of color of Washington, D.C.'s March for Women's Lives on April 25, 2004. She was the Founder and Executive Director of Atlanta, Georgia's National Center for Human Rights Education (NCHRE), the USA Partner of the Peoples' Decade of Human Rights Education from 1996 to 2004. NCHRE is a training center for activists and is based in Atlanta, Georgia. This organization prioritizes the education of grassroots organizations on topics such as human rights and legislation. Through this, the NCHRE aims to highlight the knowledge and resources that are available so they can be used and applied effectively. Informing United States citizens about the injustices that occur under their noses is the first step to achieving change since they think they are exempt; they believe the majority of unfair treatment occurs in other countries. Ensuring that people are educated builds a web of connections that allows for lessons to be learned and justice to be reached. Utilizing this web as well as the knowledge that is received ensures that accountability can be applied to individuals that abuse their power and disenfranchises others in the process. The NCHRE gives voices to those who may not have otherwise be heard, which is a clear goal of Ross' as seen through her other work in the matter.
Ross has testified on women's health and civil rights issues in many important settings including the UN, U.S. Congress, and the FDA. She has also made appearances on the talk shows: "The Donahue Show", "The Charlie Rose Show", and "Good Morning America".
Writing and teaching.
Ross has published books on reproductive justice, as well as many articles on Black women and abortion. In 2004, Ross co-authored "Undivided Rights: Women of Color Organizing for Reproductive Justice", a book that uncovers the unrevealed history of the activism of women of color in organizing for reproductive justice. Ross contributed her insights in a chapter entitled "The Color of Choice" in "Color of Violence: The INCITE! Anthology", which was published in 2016. Currently, Ross is working on her soon-to-be published book entitled "Black Abortion" that will focus on reproductive rights issues.
In 2014, Ross published an article on sterilization, tying it back to her own experience that had forced her own sterilization. Her article, "Sterilization and Reproductive Oppression in Prisons", focuses on women prisoned in the state of California who are being illegally sterilized even forty years after sterilization abuse guidelines were put into place at both the federal and state level. Despite the illusion of the end of sterilization monstrosities, in 2006-2010 more than 116 females in California prisons were illegally sterilized via a form of birth control. They were forced to undergo tubal ligation during delivery and labor. Ross's article highlights over dozens of women from minority groups - prisoners of Black, Latina, transgender, and indigent women who faced forced hysterectomies under abusive and illegal circumstances.
Ross served as a visiting Associate Professor in the Women's Studies department at Hampshire College. She taught a course “White Supremacy in the age of Trump” for the academic year 2017–2018. Ross is a consultant for Smith College, where she is expanding the Sophia Smith Collection, which includes her personal archives. She has served as a visiting professor at Smith and has organized two community-wide conferences on Calling In the Calling Out Culture. She recently served as a Visiting Clinical Professor at Arizona State University in the School of Social Transformation teaching a 400-level course on Reproductive Justice. Ross is currently a Professor at Smith College in the department of Women and Gender Studies, lecturing on White Supremacy in the Age of Trump and the power of Calling in to her students.
Alongside Rickie Solinger, Ross co-authored "Reproductive Justice: An Introduction", which details the field of reproductive justice, particularly in regards to experiences involving women of color and through a human rights analytical lens. Her most recent book, "Radical Reproductive Justice" was published by Feminist Press in 2017 and co-edited by Lynn Roberts, Erika Derkas, Whitney Peoples, and Pamela Bridgewater-Toure, discusses over two decades of works of SisterSong.
Recently Ross has spoken out against "call-out culture" and is working on a new book entitled "Calling In the Calling Out Culture.". The book is due to be published in 2022 by Simon &amp; Schuster. In addition to her book, she has also published an article about finding cancel culture toxic. This article is titled "I’m a Black Feminist. I Think Call-Out Culture Is Toxic." In her article, she touches on her own experiences with call-outs. She reveals that when she started in 1970, she found herself criticizing white women who did not understand black women. She points out the mistakes she made in expecting them to simply comprehend the experiences of women of color. Call-out culture can do the opposite of creating change because it does not advance us. Instead, Ross points out that call-outs can invoke fear of being targeted which tends to make people avoid conversations that could have been educational.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Loretta J. Ross has provided affordable online classes available on LorettaJRoss.com, “White Supremacy in the Age of Trump” and “Calling in the Calling Out Culture," which have since been attended by thousands. The “Calling in the Calling Out Culture," course challenges the Call Out culture in our society to build a more united and effective human rights movement. Students develop an understanding of: 1) What Calling Out is, 2) How to Call In people to welcome them into dialogue despite disagreements, and 3) How to build a Calling In Culture in our organizations and relationships. Participants learn how and when to invite people into a conversation instead of a fight. Loretta J. Ross' White Supremacy course offers a rethinking of how to challenge bigotry in our society by examining: 1) The difference between white supremacy as an ideology and whiteness as an identity: 2) The components of white supremacy ideology; 3) Effective responses including understanding Appropriate Whiteness and Identity Politics.
Media appearances.
Ross has appeared on the following North American television series and networks: CNN, BET, "Lead Story," "Good Morning America," "The Donahue Show," "Democracy Now," “The Laura Flanders Show,” and "The Charlie Rose Show", Oprah Winfrey Radio, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times.

SAFE13 study

The Survey of Academic Field Experiences study, also known as the SAFE13 study, was a survey conducted between February and May 2013 in order to characterize experiences of scientists working at field sites as they relate to sexual harassment and sexual assault. It has had a significant impact on collective responses to sexual harassment and sexual assault in Western academic science.
Published in 2014 by a team of anthropologists, Kathryn B. H. Clancy, Robin G. Nelson, Julienne N. Rutherford and Katie Hinde, the SAFE13 study is the first empirical investigation into scientists' experiences of harassment during fieldwork. The researchers identify three key takeaways from their work. First, women scientists are targeted more often than men, and junior scientists are also more likely to be harassed relative to senior scientists. Second, women are more likely to be harassed by senior staff, while men are harassed by their peers. Third, the majority of field scientists do not know how to report harassment.
Methods.
The study included responses from 666 field scientists (77.5% were women and 85.9% of participants identified as heterosexual). The survey was conducted in two waves. The first wave ran from February 21 to April 12, 2013, and captured responses from biological anthropologists. The second wave, running from April 13 to May 10, collected responses from scientists in other disciplines. A further 26 interviews were completed to explore more in-depth experiences of sexual harassment in a broad range of fieldwork sites. The respondents were asked about experiences had at any time during their career.
The survey was not designed to estimate the prevalence of sexual harassment or assault at field sites. It was conducted online and offered anonymity, suggesting a potential self-selection bias. Only two questions in the survey directly queried the behavior experienced by respondents:
An affirmative response to question 32 was counted as a report of sexual harassment, while an affirmative response to question 39 was counted as sexual assault, including rape.
Findings.
Almost three-quarters of participants (72.4%) had directly observed or been told about inappropriate behaviour or sexual comments during fieldwork. Around two-thirds of participants (64%) had personally experienced sexual language in the field and 20% of participants had experienced unwanted sexual contact. The study presented these findings as reports of "sexual harassment" and "sexual assault" respectively, though respondents were not asked whether they had been sexually harassed or assaulted. Following conventions in this area of scholarship, the study counted all "sexual remarks" as sexual harassment and all "unwanted sexual contact" as sexual assault.
The majority of people who experienced sexual harassment and assault were students and postdoctoral candidates. Perpetrators vary according to their target's gender: women are more likely to be harassed by superiors (senior people who have authority over them), while men are more likely to be harassed by their peers. Few people were sexually harassed by local members of the public, and instead the harassment occurred between colleagues in the field.
The SAFE13 study identifies several areas of improvement in combating sexual harassment in the field. For example, only around one-third of field scientists (37.7%) recalled a code of conduct operating at their fieldwork site, and less than one-quarter remembered there being anti-harassment policies. Amongst respondents who had experienced sexual harassment or assault, only one-fifth of survivors (20% each of women and men) knew of an easy way to formally report this experience. Amongst the small minority of people who did report sexual harassment and assault, less than 20% were satisfied with the outcome. The study therefore contributes to a body of empirical studies showing workplace sexual harassment negatively impacts on personal safety and professional productivity. In particular, the study shines attention on the role of fieldwork site directors in establishing clear rules to discourage sexual harassment.
SAFE2.
In 2017, the qualitative findings of SAFE13 were published. Authored by Nelson, Rutherford, Hinde and Clancy, the study focused on the experiences of 26 interviewees, who were mostly anthropologists or archaeologists (23 of 26 interviewees), women (23 of 26), and white (21 of 26). Some participants described incidents of sexual harassment in multiple fieldwork sites, so fifty-four field contexts are represented in their narratives. Twelve participants recalled working at field sites with clear anti-harassment rules (representing 18 fieldwork sites). These sites had training, explicit conversations, and senior researchers modelled proactive behaviour to redress sexual harassment. Actively enforced anti-harassment policies were associated with positive fieldwork experiences where scientists felt safe, valued and equal. These sites were categorised by the researchers as "green" contexts where best practice was enforced by senior members of the research team. As a result there were fewer negative experiences, and transgressions were acted upon by leaders.
The rest of the participants described ambiguity or lack of clarity about codes of conduct. Even if they had some rules, sexual harassment still took place because were no consequences. Ambiguity led to repercussions for scientists who resisted sexual coercion, such as being alienated from colleagues and being denied professional opportunities. Harassment and negative fieldwork experiences also led to negative letters of employment, strained workplace relationships, career stalling, being forced to move to another site, or leaving their careers. The hostility would be continued into the future in other contexts, such as at conferences. Some participants were discouraged or prevented from taking formal reporting action by administrators. The researchers call ambiguous sites "yellow" contexts because if there was a vague set of rules, they were not consistently applied. "Red" contexts are fieldwork sites where there is both an absence of rules and consequences.
SAFE2 and SAFE13 are recognised as having led to concrete institutional and policy changes in academic science.
Academic and public impact.
Prior to its final publication, the evolving findings of the SAFE13 study received media coverage in 2013, with a focus on how sexual harassment creates a "chilly climate" in science. Public discussion of the evolving study's findings explored the negative impact of harassment on junior women researchers. Media articles focused on fear of professional retribution if scientists report sexual harassment. Other science publishers discussed the sense of powerless that both victims and bystanders face as harassment goes unpunished.
After the final report was published, the study became widely cited as evidence that sexual harassment contributes to women leaving science careers. Professional scientific societies publicly responded that, beyond making principal researchers responsible for reporting sexual harassment, institutional responses were additionally required.
The SAFE13 study inspired women scientists in other fields to conduct similar surveys into sexual harassment. It also paved the way for larger institutional surveys on harassment by professional societies. The SAFE13 study is referenced in high-profile cases, to contextualise the institutional dynamics that enable harassment to continue over many years. The study has had a major impact on American astronomy and physics in particular, as these disciplines increasingly grapple with public incidents of harassment.
In 2016, USA Rep. Jackie Speier of California sponsored a bill to compel research institutions to report investigations of harassment as a condition of receiving federal grant money. She cited the SAFE13 study as one piece of evidence informing the bill. She also referred to SAFE13 in media interviews. In February 2018, the USA National Science Foundation (NSF) announced it would require institutions to report whenever a researcher who is funded by their grants has engaged in sexual harassment. The NSF also expects institutions they fund to provide a harassment-free workplace. The NSF Office of Diversity and Inclusion will additionally provide policies and resources to support this aim, and create an anonymous reporting system to receive direct reports of sexual harassment. The NSF is one of various science agencies under pressure by the USA Congress to counter sexual harassment. This represents a major cultural change in scientific science since the SAFE13 study first recommended a review of institutional responses to harassment.
On 27 February 2018, lead researcher of the SAFE13 study, Kathryn (Kate) Clancy, provided testimony to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing on sexual harassment in science. The hearing identified a need to redress sexual harassment in science as a way to boost opportunities in science. Clancy testified that creating a safe, harassment-free workplace culture was imperative to improving science.
Five years after its preliminary findings were released, the SAFE13 study continues to be referenced in various media articles exploring how victims of sexual harassment are punished when they report harassment. SAFE13 has also been cited as an important resource in responding to the aftermath of the #MeToo movement in 2017, by providing systematic context of sexual harassment.
Since 2013, scientists have consistently used the hashtag #SAFE13 in connection to other research on sexual harassment, as well as to discuss media reports and investigations on sexual harassment in science and academia, and to share personal experiences of harassment in academic science.

Sylvia Holland

Sylvia Holland (born Sylvia Moberly, 20 July 1900 – 14 April 1974) was a British-born concept artist, illustrator, and the second woman to become a storyboard artist for Walt Disney Productions. She worked for Disney in the 1930s and 1940s and is especially known for her work on the 1940 film "Fantasia".
Biography.
Born in the village of Ampfield, England on 20 July 1900, Holland was born Sylvia Moberly was one of four children. Her father was an ordained clergyman and musician who organized an all-women string orchestra. As a child, she developed a hobby of photography after receiving a Kodak point-and-shoot camera, as well loved to draw and conduct music. As a teenager, she was enrolled at the Gloucestershire School of Domestic Science before moving to London to study at the Architectural Association School in 1919. Holland graduated in 1925, and became the first woman to join the Royal Institute of British Architects. The following year, she married Frank Holland, a fellow architecture student from Canada. The couple moved to Victoria, British Columbia and had their first child, Theodora.
In Canada, Sylvia joined the Architectural Institute of British Columbia. In 1928, Sylvia, who was pregnant with their son Boris, traveled to England to see her parents leaving her husband behind at home. While she was away, Frank had developed a cold, and after some Christmas shopping in severely cold Canadian weather, he was diagnosed with an ear infection. Frank later died from mastoiditis on 28 December, a month before the birth of their son. Not long after, the Great Depression had occurred in which demand for architectural projects had plummeted. During the early 1930s, Sylvia moved her single-parent household to a farm in Metchosin. Sometime later, her son developed the same ailment as Frank, in which Sylvia was advised by a doctor to seek a drier climate. In 1936, she re-located her family to Los Angeles, but because she did not have an American degree, she could not practice as an architect. A year later, Sylvia was hired as a sketch artist by Universal Studios on several movies such as "One Hundred Men and a Girl" (1937) and "Mad About Music" (1938).
After seeing "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937), Holland decided she wanted to work for Walt Disney Productions. To gain more experience in animation, she briefly worked as a cel inker for Walter Lantz Productions. By the summer of 1938, she had heard that Disney's next film after "Pinocchio" (1940) would be a concert film. Excited at the news, Holland applied to work for Disney and was granted an interview with Walt Disney. On 6 September, she was hired, and became the second woman hired into their story department, following Bianca Majolie (up until then, women had only been hired to do inking and painting).
Because of her background as a musician and artist, her first assignment was the "Pastoral Symphony" segment for "Fantasia" (1940). By December 1938, Holland had been asked to supervise the "Waltz of the Flowers" segment of the "Nutcracker Suite". After being partnered with Majolie and fellow sketch artist Ethel Kulsar, her responsibilities at Disney included story direction, concept art, colour studies, timing, and supervising other artists. Throughout her career at the Disney studios, Walt Disney held her in high regard, noting that she was "a highly talented artist with a marvelous sense for decoration and color" who "contributed immensely to the good taste and beauty of our pictures".
By April 1940, "Fantasia" had been finished, and Holland later developed concept art on the "Little April Shower" sequence for the 1942 film "Bambi". With Mary Blair, she developed concept art for "Baby Ballet", a sequence intended for a planned sequel to "Fantasia" that never got made. Around this same time, Holland was developing storyboards on an early version of "The Little Mermaid". However, by September 1941, Holland had been laid off, but she returned back to Disney in August 1942 to develop storyboards on "Victory Through Air Power" (1943). By early 1945, the Disney studios had looked to salvage abandoned musical segments and combine them for the 1946 package film "Make Mine Music". During production, Holland had written story treatments about Greek muses, which later became the "Two Silhouettes" sequence. 
Holland was laid off from Disney once again in 1946, and briefly worked for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. She then became a children's illustrator for Whitman Publishing as well worked as a greetings card designer for "MacMillan's Readers" and Chryston Limited Edition. During the 1950s, she purchased three and a half acres within the San Fernando Valley in which she constructed two houses and an office on Ventura Boulevard. During the 1960s and 1970s, she also developed a past time of developing of a new breed of Siamese cats, the Balinese, which brought her international attention.
On Easter Sunday 1974, Holland died from a stroke in Tarzana, California.

Fiber-optic display

A fiber-optic display is a light-emitting display that uses fiber optics to display images or text. Fiber-optic displays can either be static or dynamic, with the typical lighting source being halogen light bulbs.
Static fiber optic displays.
Static fiber optic displays have been commonly used for some types of traffic signals. One common use for static fiber optic displays are lane control lights, which display either a green downward-pointing arrow or a red X to indicate the open/closed status of road lanes.
Dynamic fiber optic displays.
Dynamic fiber optic displays typically display alphanumeric text, and utilize electromechanical shutters to open or close the ends of the fiber strands to display an alphanumeric pixel. These type of displays were commonly used as variable-message signs on highways. Compared to eggcrate displays, dynamic fiber optic displays offered lower energy consumption due to requiring fewer bulbs, and offered improved nighttime legibility. For daytime legibility, they were sometimes combined with flip-disc displays to be reflective in daylight and emissive at night.

Themes and composition.
Lyrically, the song has been described by "Alternative Press" as "a deep dive into the heart of fear". "Attention Attention" is a concept album that details a person's progression, from being in a dark, negative space, to working through their issues and eventually progressing into be a new, more positive person; "Devil" is the second track from the album, and the first fully formed song after the intro track, placing it in the more negativity-themed side of the album. Frontman Brent Smith outlined the meaning of the song:
Musically, Loudwire described the song as having a dense, wall of sound quality to it, describing it as having a "sliding guitar lick and off kilter beat"...backing choirs.. layers of synth, piano and guitar textures."

Geography.
Lannanerriagh is bounded on the west by Derrynananta Upper and Doon (Drumreilly) townlands, on the south by Moher (Drumreilly) townland and on the east by Tullyveela and Greaghnaloughry townlands. Its chief geographical features are Benbrack Mountain reaching to an altitude of 1,600 feet above sea-level, forestry plantations, gravel pits, mountain streams, waterfalls, spring wells and dug wells. Lannanerriagh is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 708 statute acres. A sub-division in the upper part of the townland is called Crickeen (Cnoc Ín = The Little Hill). A local poet in the 1860s, Dr. Curran, wrote- "Crickeen was a freehold in the time of Adam's race/ for the Peelers and Mollies each other to chase".
History.
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey depicts the townland as "Laneneriagh" with the proprietor being "Lieutenant-Colonel Tristram Beresford".
A deed by Thomas Enery dated 29 Jan 1735 includes the lands of "Lannaneryaugh".
Lowther Kirkwood of Mullinagrave, parish of Templeport, Co. Cavan, gentleman made the following will:
A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Launenarough" and the owner as "The Lord Primate" with the lessee as "Mr. Kirkwood".

History of Pieria (regional unit)

This is a reflection of the main historical events in Pieria (Πιερία), Central Macedonia.
Location.
Pieria is the southernmost regional unit of the Central Macedonia region, with the capital Katerini; Pieria is bordered to the south by Thessaly.
History.
Neolithic period, ca. 6500 to 3000 BC.
In the 7th millennium BC, the area around Mount Olympus and the Pieria Mountains was settled, possibly from the east. The environment offered the settlers good living conditions, such as a mild climate, water, fertile farmland and hunting grounds. Finds from this period come from the area of Korinos, Ritini, Pigi Athinas and Makrygialos. Remains of settlements have been scarcely excavated, but found graves with various grave goods: stone and earthen figures, clay vessels, tools made of bone and stone, flint arrowheads and pieces of jewellery, which were made of bone or clay.
Bronze Age, ca. 3000 to 1000 BC.
Settlement patterns shifted from the mountains towards the sea. Metalworking, shipping and trade brought prosperity to the region. The archaeological finds from this era are, inter alia, from Platamonas (the ancient Heraklion), Aiginio, Ancient Methone, Ancient Pydna, Pigi Artemidos, Trimbina, Kitros (Louloudies) and Korinos.
In addition to individual tombs, necropolises and settlements were discovered. The finds from this period include clay pottery and in the earth embedded earthen storage vessels, also metal tools and weapons, and jewelry made of gold, silver, bronze and glass.
Mycenaean period.
The end of the Bronze Age is referred to as Mycenaean period in southern Greece and Crete, as these areas were under the cultural influence of Mycenae. During this time not only Mycenaean goods were traded in the Mediterranean, but also adopted Mycenaean culture and customs. Mycenaean graves and earthenware have survived from this period, the latter being very helpful in dating archeological findings. The northern limit of the spread of the Mycenaean culture is in Pieria, further north, no signs have been discovered.
Iron Age, ca. 1000 to 700 BC.
The coastal population grew, with some Bronze Age settlements seemingly abandoned. Pieria was more populated by places that offered natural protection (e.g. Sfendani, Kouko or Livadi), existing settlements were fortified (the ancient Methone with a three-meter-high wall). Trade relations were expanded and the Phoenician alphabet introduced and modified for the Greek language.
Finds from this period are in addition to jewelry, pottery, weapons and tools also remains of wooden grave borders.
Roman period, ca. 146 BC to 330 AD.
The archaeological finds from the over 1000-year period from the end of the Iron Age to the end of the Roman rule over Pieria are very extensive. Dion is the leading archaeological site here, the ownership issues are clarified there, the archaeologists can work freely in a large area. Elsewhere, such as in Methone, land under which antiquities are suspected is privately owned. Methone benefited from several years of collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA); this gave valuable insights into the beginnings of the Greek alphabet. In Leivithra and Pydna, which could easily be excavated, the Greek state is currently lacking funds (May 2018).
The finds are either displayed in museums or they are stored. Fully equipped is the archaeological museum at Dion, at the Leivithra Park only replicas are exhibited, the recent finds from Leivithra are stored at the Archaeological museum of Dion. In the archaeological museum of Makrygialos smaller artefacts and earthen vessels are exhibited; the museum is not yet open to the public (as of May 2018).
Coins, jewelry, earthen and glass vessels, weapons, tools, building materials, sarcophagi, grave steles, statues, statuettes, well enclosures, mosaics, a water organ and many other pieces were discovered.
Byzantine period, ca. 330 to 1453 AD.
Important archaeological sites of the Byzantine period are the castle of Platamon, Louloudies and the castle of Pydna, built by Frankish knights over the ruins of the ancient city. From Byzantine times come the inhabited monasteries Kanalon and Agia Triada, Sparmos. Furthermore, there are numerous churches of this period, such as the Holy Trinity (Agia Triada), located above Vrondou, and the Church of the Assumption at Kontariotissa.
Significant archaeological finds from this period are mainly of ecclesiastical origin. They are exhibited in the archaeological museum of Dion or in the museums of the monasteries.

Better Call Saul (season 3)

The third season of the American television drama series "Better Call Saul" premiered on April 10, 2017, and concluded on June 19, 2017. The ten-episode season was broadcast on Monday nights in the United States on AMC. A spin-off of "Breaking Bad", "Better Call Saul" was created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, both of whom also worked on "Breaking Bad".
The third season immediately follows the events of the second season, which take place in late 2002. The year is 2003 by the third season's conclusion. Bob Odenkirk reprises his role as Jimmy McGill, a lawyer who is engaged in a feud with his lawyer brother Chuck (Michael McKean), who believes Jimmy is unfit and unqualified to be a lawyer and plots to have him disbarred from the practice. Jonathan Banks also reprises his role as Mike Ehrmantraut, who is in partnership with Gustavo Fring (Giancarlo Esposito), while Nacho Varga (Michael Mando) is plotting to murder their rival, Hector Salamanca (Mark Margolis).
The third season of "Better Call Saul" received acclaim from critics, and eight nominations for the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series.
Production.
Casting.
The third season of "Better Call Saul" features the return of several of the original cast from "Breaking Bad", most notably Giancarlo Esposito (Gus Fring), who returned in the second episode "Witness". In a Q&amp;A with AMC, Esposito expressed excitement on his return into the "Breaking Bad" universe, saying, 
All of the main cast members returned for this season. Bob Odenkirk returns as Jimmy McGill, Jonathan Banks returns as Mike Ehrmantraut, Rhea Seehorn returns as Kim Wexler, Patrick Fabian returns as Howard Hamlin, Michael Mando returns as Nacho Varga, and Michael McKean returns as Chuck McGill, Jimmy's elder brother. This was the first season of "Better Call Saul" to feature Giancarlo Esposito as a member of the main cast.
Filming.
"Better Call Saul" is set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the same location as its predecessor.
In the first scene from the first episode, Jimmy is hiding his real identity under his Gene Takavic alias while working at a Cinnabon in a shopping mall in Omaha, Nebraska. The Cinnabon scenes in "Better Call Saul" are set in Omaha, but filmed at the Cottonwood Mall in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Episodes.
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
"Talking Saul".
"Talking Saul" is a live aftershow hosted by Chris Hardwick, which features guests discussing episodes of "Better Call Saul". These episodes discussed the third-season premiere and finale episodes of "Better Call Saul".
"Los Pollos Hermanos Employee Training with Gus Fring".
AMC released a series of ten short videos on YouTube and their social media accounts during season three as "Los Pollos Hermanos Employee Training with Gus Fring", combining live-action shots featuring Esposito as Gus along with animated segments, presented as employee training videos for Gus's Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant workers. The series won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Form Comedy or Drama Series in 2017.
Reception.
Critical response.
The third season of "Better Call Saul", much like the previous two, received universal acclaim, particularly for McKean's performance as Chuck, and the character development of Jimmy McGill. On Rotten Tomatoes, the third season has an approval rating of 97% based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 8.78/10. The site's critical consensus is: ""Better Call Saul" shows no signs of slipping in season 3, as the introduction of more familiar faces causes the inevitable transformation of its lead to pick up exciting speed." On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the season has a score of 87 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".
Terri Schwartz of IGN rated the third season 9.1/10, praising Jimmy's character development saying: ""Better Call Saul" was better than it's ever been in Season 3." Verne Gay of "Newsday" gave it an "A+" grade and wrote, "Based on the first two episodes, "Saul" is making a case that it could be even better than "Breaking Bad"."
Significance.
Chuck's arc.
Jimmy tries to make amends with Chuck in the season finale, "Lantern", but Chuck coldly cuts ties with Jimmy, telling him that "he never really mattered all that much to him". After Chuck forces Jimmy away, his EHS symptoms begin to re-emerge, and he becomes obsessed with disabling all electronic devices in his home to the point of tearing walls open to remove the wiring. He eventually reaches a breaking point and knocks a gas lantern over, setting fire to his house. After this scene, there was much speculation as to what happened to Chuck after the fire started. Showrunner Peter Gould said, "I don't want to define anything more than what's on screen". Michael McKean, who played Chuck, told "Vulture": "I got a call on my cell from Peter [and] Vince [Gilligan]. I said, 'If this is the death call, I'm going to pull over.' And that's what I did. I pulled into the parking lot of the bookstore and I called them back and they told me what they had planned. They told me they had laughed about what I had said, but they had to deliver it". When asked if his character was dead, McKean said: "I am. I know they want to bring me in for some flashbacks this coming season, but that's kind of beside the point". As revealed in the fourth season's premiere, Howard notifies Jimmy and Kim about the fire, and they arrive at the scene just in time to see Chuck's body being taken away.
Home media.
The third season was released on Blu-ray and DVD in region 1 on January 16, 2018. The set contains all 10 episodes, plus audio commentaries for every episode and several behind-the-scenes featurettes.
International broadcast.
Outside the U.S. in certain international markets, season 3 was released on Netflix with episodes available the day after the episodes were broadcast on AMC.

Jane Wadsworth

Jane Wadsworth (1942–1997) was a medical statistician and a pioneer in academic sexual health research.
Early life.
Wadsworth was born in 1942 during the Second World War as the eldest of four children. Her family moved to Sevenoaks where her father established a GP practice after his demobilisation.
Career.
Following an education at West Heath School, Jane went on to study Mathematics at St. Andrews University, Scotland. She met her husband, Michael Wadsworth, in London and the couple moved to Edinburgh where they started their young family. Following their return to London, Jane began working part-time at the Institute for Social Sciences in Medical Care.
When her youngest child began school, Jane returned to education and completed an MSc in Medical Statistics at the London School of Hygiene. This was followed by a series of research positions in London, Bristol and Exeter before she took on the position of Lecturer in Medical Statistics at St. Marys Hospital Medical Schooin l 1983. While with the hospital Wadsworth contributed to several clinical studies, inclining a study of pelvic pain syndrome with Professor Richard Beard and the Nation Childhood Encephalophathy Study with Professor David Miller.
When the Aids epidemic arrived, Wadsworth became involved in determining the pattern of the HIV infection throughout Britain. This was the first attempt to conduct a study about sexual behaviour in the UK and gave Jane Wadsworth the opportunity to take the leading role in initiating her own research programme for the first time. During this period, Wadsworth's personal life became more strained, however, and her marriage broke up in the late 1980s.
After several years of laying the foundations for sex research, Wadsworth, together with Julia Field, Anne Johnson and Kaye Wellings, embarked on a national study during which they interviewed 18,876 men and women about their sex lives. The study was filmed by Horizon for television and the women briefly found themselves in the eye of the media.
In 1994, Wadsworth and her fellow researcher published Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyle detailing the results of the survey. A version of this, Sexual Behaviour in Britain, was serialised in the Independent on Sunday. As the first of its kind, the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyle (NATSAL) became both the gold standard and the model for subsequent studies for a number of countries the world.
Awards and Honours.
The Jane Wadsworth clinic for Sexual Health of the Jefferiss wing at St. Marys Hospital, Paddington, was named for her.

Roscia gens

The gens Roscia, probably the same as Ruscia, was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are mentioned as early as the fifth century BC, but after this time they vanish into obscurity until the final century of the Republic. A number of Roscii rose to prominence in imperial times, with some attaining the consulship from the first to the third centuries.
Origin.
The nomen "Roscius" is of uncertain origin; Chase suggests a possible derivation from "roscidus", dewy or sprinkled with dew, and classifies the name with those that either originated at Rome, or cannot be shown to have come from anywhere else. The first of the Roscii appearing in history was a Roman ambassador, but the later Roscii may have been provincials; there was an important family of this name at Ameria, an Umbrian town not far from the border of Latium, which held the status of a municipium, and perhaps acquired Roman citizenship as early as 338 BC, at the conclusion of the Latin War.
Praenomina.
The main praenomina of the Roscii were "Lucius", "Marcus", "Quintus", "Sextus", and "Titus".
Branches and cognomina.
The cognomina of the Roscii during the Republic were "Fabatus" and "Otho". "Fabatus" seems to be derived from "faba", a bean, also the root of the nomen Fabia, and suggests that the ancestors of the Roscii were engaged in agriculture. "Otho" is better known as a surname of the Salvia gens. "Gallus", a cockerel, appears in a commentary on Cicero as a surname of the actor Quintus Roscius, but the name is not found in other sources. Other cognomina of the Roscii include "Capito", indicating someone with a large head; "Magnus", great; and "Regulus", a prince, a diminutive of "rex", a king.
In imperial times two distinct families of the Roscii came to prominence; one bearing the surname "Murena", an lamprey, well known from a family of the Licinii. This family flourished in the late first and early second centuries, and one of them bore the additional surname "Lupus", a wolf. The other "stirps" bore the cognomen "Aelianus", probably indicating descent from a family of the Aelii through the female line. This family obtained several consulships beginning at the end of the first century, and continuing into the third.

<doc id="56777067" url="?curid=56777067" title="Capromeryx">
Capromeryx

Capromeryx was a genus of dwarf pronghorns (Antilocapridae) that originated in North America during the Pliocene about 5 million years ago (the exact range of their presence on the landscape is still not known, but the most recent fossils found are dated to 11,000 years ago). The closest living relative and only surviving member of the family is the North American pronghorn ("Antilocapra americana"). "Capromeryx furcifer" is one of the smallest artiodactlys known, being at the shoulder and in weight.
Description.
"Capromeryx" were the smallest members of the pronghorn family Antilocapridae. They are recognized by having two upright horns that are conical in shape (wider at the base and tapering toward the top). The United States distribution of this genus includes: Arizona, California, Florida, New Mexico, Texas, and Washington. Fossils have also been found in the Mexican states of: Chihuahua, Sonara, and Baja California. Many "Capromeryx" fossils have been found in tar pits, and juveniles are especially common. One such location is the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, where enough bones have been unearthed to produce a full skeleton sample of "Capromeryx minor".
Much like the living pronghorns that exist today, the habitat that these animals were thought to inhabit were grassy plains with some shrubs and large trees for them to take refuge in. It is still unknown what exactly they ate and how they interacted socially but it is speculated that they were similar in many ways to their living relatives, the North American Pronghorn.
Classification.
Though the identification of "Capromeryx" often relies on the basis of tooth size and shape, the description and acceptance of the various species of "Capromeryx" requires the fossil presence of horn cores (the bony inner shaft of the horn). Some species have not yet produced these cores and therefore have not been recognized as distinct species. Fossil specimens are instead classified by size. Fossils identified as the family Antilocapridae are similarly distributed into genus by size, with "Capromeryx" being the smallest of the known Pronghorns.
There are several species of "Capromeryx", however only four have been formally recognized:
Some described but unrecognized species include:
Discovery and species.
The earliest fossil records of "Capromeryx" are dated to 5 million years ago, during the Pliocene, and the most recent are dated to about 11,000 years ago around the time of their extinction. The fossils over time showed a distinct change in size for the "Capromeryx", as they started out with larger bodies and distinct two pronged horns with a smaller anterior prong and a large posterior prong, and evolved to become smaller with less distinct horns, where the anterior prong was barely visible due to the decreased size under the horn sheath.
The first description of "C. furcifer" was in 1902 by W.D. Matthew in New Mexico, but it has been found in other locations as well but by other individuals (Hay Springs, Nebraska and La Brea, California are two such locations).
The first description of "C. arizonensis" was in 1942 by M. F. Skinner also found in New Mexico at two sites called Pearsons Mesa and Caballo. These sites are described as being late Blancan.
James K. Morgan and Neil H. Morgan were the first to describe "C. tauntonensis" in 1995 in the "Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology." They discovered the fossils that included horn cores and teeth during a dig (from 1988 to 1992) in Blancan sediments in Adams County, Washington.
Extinction.
Though it is unknown why exactly "Capromeryx" disappeared from the North American landscape, it is evident that this genus began to decline in diversity around the time of the Late Miocene.
