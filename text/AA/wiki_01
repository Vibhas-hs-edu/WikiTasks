Katrina Lake

Katrina Lake (born December 24, 1982) is an American businesswoman who is the Founder and CEO of Stitch Fix, a fashion-based subscription service. Stitch Fix was established in 2011 in San Francisco and went public in 2017. In 2017, Lake became the youngest woman to take a company public at age 34 and was the only woman in 2017 to lead an initial public offering in technology. She was surpassed by Whitney Wolfe Herd in 2021, who took Bumble public at age 31.
As of November 2017, Lake held a 16.6% stake in Stitch Fix. In 2017, "Forbes" named Lake one of America's richest self-made women.
Early life and education.
Lake was born on December 24, 1982, in San Francisco. Her mother is a Japanese immigrant who taught in the public school system, and her father was a doctor at UCSF and the University of Minnesota. She initially wanted to become a doctor before she became an entrepreneur. She began on the pre-med course but became very interested in economics and business.
She received her bachelor's degree from Stanford University in 2005 and earned an MBA from Harvard Business School in 2011.
Career.
Lake worked at Polyvore and management consultancy The Parthenon Group after graduating from Stanford.
While pursuing her MBA from Harvard, Lake founded Stitch Fix in 2011 at the age of 28. Lake collected SurveyMonkey data from her clients to get a sense of their style. She would use the information to hand select outfits and send them to her customers. At its early stages, Lake did not even have the Internet capabilities to charge her customers and required trust from her clients to pay her monthly. In 2012, Lake was introduced to Netflix VP of data science and engineering Eric Colson, who initially dismissed the business model as "whimsical" but within months joined the company as "chief algorithms officer". She has combined data science with marketing to grow the business.
Customers of Stitch Fix order "fixes" of five items, selected for them by professional stylists, as a one off or at scheduled intervals, and are subsequently given three days to choose which items they want to keep. In 2016–17, Stitch Fix had $730 million in sales.
Lake was listed as one of Fast Company's 100 Most Creative People in Business 
and in the 2016 Fortune (magazine) 40 under 40. Lake was the only woman to take an internet company public in 2017. On the day of the initial public offering, Stitch Fix raised nearly $120 million. In 2018, she was named Disruptor of the Year by Retail Dive.
Lake is a board member at Grubhub and beauty company Glossier.
Lake appeared as a guest shark on Season 11, Episode 14 of the ABC show "Shark Tank", which aired on March 6, 2020. Lori Greiner of HSN and Lake teamed up to make a deal with a young budding company for children's glasses, Pair Eyewear.
Lake is a member of YPO.
On April 13, 2021, Lake announced that she would step down as CEO of Stitch Fix. She would be succeeded by Stitch Fix president Elizabeth Spaulding.

The Echoes (American group)

The Echoes were a vocal trio from Brooklyn, most famous for their 1961 hit single "Baby Blue". The group was composed of Tommy Duffy, Harry Boyle, and Tom Morrissey. The three had been members of the Laurels.
The Echoes' first single, "Baby Blue", was a major hit, reaching No. 12 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. The Echoes continued to release singles through 1965, but none experienced the same level of success. After changes, the group would be re-branded as The Scoundrels.
Morrissey would later go on to be chairman of the Arizona Republican Party.

Luo Haocai

Luo Haocai (; March 1934 – 12 February 2018) was a Chinese legal scholar, Supreme Court judge, and politician. He served as professor and Vice President of Peking University, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, Chairman of China Zhi Gong Party (Public Interest Party), and Vice Chairperson of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). In the field of administrative law, he proposed the "theory of balance", which has become highly influential in China.
Early life in Singapore.
Luo was born in March 1934 in Singapore, with his ancestral home in Anxi County, Fujian, China. His grandfather had moved to Burma and later settled in Singapore. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, his uncle and the principal of his school were killed in the Sook Ching massacre.
British rule was restored in Singapore at the end of World War II. While a 17-year-old student at The Chinese High School, Luo participated in the anti-colonial movement and was jailed by the British government for more than a year. As he had lost his birth certificate, he was deported to China in July 1952 after his release from prison.
Academic career.
In China, Luo studied at Zhiyong High School in Guangzhou and Wuxi No.1 High School in Jiangsu. He was admitted to Peking University Law School in 1956, and stayed on as a faculty member after graduating in 1960.
Starting as an assistant teacher, he rose to lecturer, associate professor, professor, and eventually Vice President of Peking University. He was also Vice President of the Chinese Law Society and Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese.
Theory of balance.
In the 1990s, Luo proposed the "theory of balance" in administrative law. According to Luo, the fundamental relationship in administrative law is that between the administrative power and a person or organization. In premodern times, the relationship was unequal: the authorities imposed duties on individuals. In modern capitalist societies, which have established the rule of law, administrative law aims to control the power of the authorities and protect the basic rights of individuals. Although this has been a major development in human society, Luo argued that the system sacrifices efficiency for the sake of democracy and impedes economic development. His proposed solution is a "theory of balance", which seeks to simultaneously protect and restrain both the power of the administrative organ and the rights of citizens. His theory has become highly influential in China, although it is also controversial.
Political career.
He joined the China Zhi Gong Party (Public Interest Party) in 1992, and became its vice-chairman. From 1995 to 2000, he served as Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, China's highest court. In 1997 he was elected as Chairman of the Party, and in the following year, as Vice Chairperson of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). He served in both positions for two terms (10 years).
In 1999, he served as a member of the Preparatory Committee for the Handover of Macau.
Death.
Luo died in Beijing in the morning of 12 February 2018, at the age of 83.

John Barnes (film producer)

John Wadsworth Barnes (March 25, 1920 – June 27, 2000) was an American film director and producer. He was most active in the educational film industry, producing, directing and writing for Encyclopædia Britannica Films. In his career he worked on and helped create over 100 film projects. He produced the Academy Award nominated documentary "The Living City". He wrote for a radio drama series, made experimental Bolex films, and produced the film "To Live Together."
Biography.
John Barnes was born on March 25, 1920 in Belford, New Jersey. He came from a blue-collar, East Coast background of craftsmen. In elementary school Barnes had rheumatic fever that sparked a love for books and learning which was very influential on him. Another early influence was his teenage rebellion against his mother that influenced his attitude towards people he thought of as inferior intellectually and those who caused inconvenience or challenged his choices artistically and professionally.
In 1939 Barnes graduated from Monmouth Junior College in Long Branch New Jersey. He later went on to attend the University of Chicago. John Barnes worked as an editor for the literary magazine of the University. He did not end up graduating.
John Barnes died in the New York University Medical Center on June 27, 2000. He was 80 years old at the time of his death.
Career.
Following his time at the University of Chicago, Barnes went on to pursue writing for CBS, the local radio station. One of the main projects he worked on with CBS was a short radio-drama series, featuring Ken Nordine as the host. He was fiercely protective of this films and would demand those who asked for changes to his scripts and films to defend their request before considering it.
Barnes' works frequently starred notable actors such as Judi Dench, Douglass Campbell, Richard Kiley, as well as Frances Sternhagen. Barnes wrote and directed a series titled "Shaw v. Shakespeare" that featured George Bernard Shaw as played by actor Donald Moffat. The three part series has been accepted by many as Barnes's magnum opus. Barnes put much weight on casting actors who were excellent at their craft and even with budget constraints he avoided casting lesser actors.
Barnes worked with Encyclopædia Britannica for over 20 years. His immense amount of educational films remain screened, circulated, and present today. After going from making documentary film to academic, he stayed in educational film from the early 1950s and persevered into the late 1970s when educational film experienced a golden era. Educational films were typically used to ignite classroom discussions after the screening, that meant that the context, history, and complete story had to be told in a short period of time. These discussion periods, according to educational theorists, engage with students better than lectures and reading by allowing students to express their opinions and learn from speaking to each other. Later, Barnes moved away from film making and wrote plays, some were produced in the U.S. and Canada.
Encyclopaedia Britannica.
In 1952 he embarked on his first project with EB Films, with Gordon Weisenborn as director and Barnes as writer and producer. "People Along the Mississippi" is said to be one of the first portrayals of the interaction between black and white children on film. Barnes fought against institutional censorship in southern schools which helped expand production and distribution of integrated educational films.
His Oscar nominated documentary "The Living City", about urban issues mainly in Chicago. Despite what Oscar nominations may allude to, those filmmakers who produced educational films made very little and relied on others to finance them so that they could continue with this career. He is known for the abundance of social themes in his films, like in the films he made for Encyclopædia Britannica's 'Bill of Rights' series.
Barnes continued to produce and direct iconic literary adaptations like "Macbeth: The Politics of Power" (1964) as well as more politically oriented works such as "Equality under the Law: The Lost Generation of Prince Edward County" (1966) and "People along the Mississippi" (1951) that have interracial themes, which was influenced by his mother's racist actions towards a teenage friend of Barnes.

Reception.

However he is one of the stronger brassmen in jazz of the 1990s and plays quite well on this set ... The music is straightahead but occasionally as unpredictable as the repertoire".

Milkman's Matinee

Milkman's Matinee is an American radio disc jockey radio program that began on WNEW in New York City in 1935, with the concept later being adopted by other radio stations. The WNEW show was notable for being (at least in its era) the longest daily program on radio at five hours and for making WNEW the first radio station in the world to broadcast 24 hours a day. The program's novelty and impact were such that it received three pages of coverage in the October 23, 1939, issue of "Life" magazine.
Background.
The "Biographical Encyclopedia of American Radio" credits newspaper columnist Walter Winchell and WNEW general manager Bernice Judis with the creation of "Milkman's Matinee". Judis's entry in the book says, "When authoritative columnist Walter Winchell wished (in print) for a radio station that would keep metropolitan New York's all-night work force company during the wee hours, Judis introduced the "Milkman's Matinee.""
When Stan Shaw began going on the air at 2a.m. Eastern Time, he made free entertainment available to more than 400,000 night-shift workers in the New York metropolitan area. For six nights a week, he entertained charwomen, bakers, tugboat crews, cab drivers, and others who worked through the early morning hours. Over the years, the program's schedule changed from time to time. In 1960, it was broadcast from midnight to 5:30 a.m. seven days a week.
Format.
Shaw played an average of 80 records per program with the help of an assistant. Two teleprinter machines brought in an average of 135 requests per program, with an employee from the Postal Telegraph company on hand to handle the incoming messages. As requests continued to arrive, the station increased the program's record library from its original 10,000 to 24,000 six years later. In January 1942, requests were discontinued in compliance with a wartime censorship code under which "Musical request shows are banned because they offer a means whereby enemy agents can send code messages."
Along with music, Shaw mixed in weather reports, market news, and what "Life" described as "a fresh stream of homey chatter". Shaw used Anson Weeks' recording, "My Very Good Friend the Milkman" as his opening and closing theme for each broadcast.
Partial list of hosts.
At times, "Milkman's Matinee" was broadcast seven nights a week. The list below includes those who had only the weekend broadcasts as well as those who had the main Monday-Friday shows.
Popularity and revenue.
In 1949, a survey conducted by the Pulse, Inc., rating service found that "Milkman's Matinee" was the top-rated post-midnight radio program in the metropolitan New York area. A 1955 Pulse survey showed that the program had more than three times the number of listeners of its closest competitor. In 1960, officials at WNEW said ratings for "Milkman's Matinee" were 20 percent higher than those of its closest competitor. That was the program's 25th year, and the station's general manager said advertising sales over that span were estimated at $2.5 million.
As time went on, the all-night concept had spread to other radio stations, including WPEN in Philadelphia and WBGE in Atlanta. In 1941, a radio columnist for the "Brooklyn Eagle" wrote that more than 20 stations "have copied the idea".
Transatlantic transmission.
On August 15, 1947, two apparently unprecedented events occurred on "Milkman's Matinee". Art Ford broadcast via shortwave radio from studios of the British Broadcasting Corporation in London, England, as part of a salute to the musical "Oklahoma!". Besides being the first transatlantic disc jockey broadcast, the show also featured the first broadcast of a radio duet between two continents, as Mary Hatcher in New York and Howard Keel in London sang "People Will Say We're in Love". Composer Richard Rodgers and librettist Oscar Hammerstein II were also on hand in the studio with Ford.
Recent years.
In 2013, Metromedia Radio initiated an automated version of "Milkman's Matinee" that was syndicated to radio stations in the United States and 60 other countries.

After passing the test of , who is later revealed as the guardian of the magical objects called the Miraculouses, by helping him, Adrien is chosen as one of the two soon-to-be superheroes alongside Ladybug, for whom he quickly develops feelings and whose secret civilian identity is Marinette Dupain-Cheng.

Adrien was conceptualized as a character who would appeal to everyone, having many good characteristics and being able to inspire the viewers. Regarding Adrien's superhero identity, since Ladybug's power was connected to good luck, Astruc concluded that her partner would have powers related to bad luck, which resulted in him thinking of a black cat.

Development.
Concept and creation.
Adrien Agreste was conceptualized as a "modern" Prince Charming, "with many good human qualities" and "a feminine part"; Thomas Astruc, the creator of the animated television series "", described these characteristics as "a perfect combo", adding that Adrien is "a really nice character". He also characterized Adrien as "handsome, smart, brave, but also very sensitive", and as someone that "everybody would naturally fall in love with". When asked how Adrien and Marinette Dupain-Cheng had been developed, Astruc commented that he had wanted to "present sunny characters who could inspire people all around the world in this new century".
Astruc stated that since ladybugs are associated with good luck, he had decided that Ladybug's partner would have powers connected to bad luck, and as a result he had thought of a black cat. The creation of Cat Noir () was also a tribute to Catwoman. Astruc commented that Cat Noir's civilian identity had initially been a character named Félix, describing him as "an early love interest for Marinette" who would have had a distant attitude toward her and would have been included in the "typical cold-and-snobbish-guy anime trope". He said that while the difference between Félix and Cat Noir's personalities would have worked positively, it would not have provided very good narratives in the long term. Because of this, Félix was replaced with Adrien. Astruc stated that Cat Noir is one of the two most "powerful teenagers" alongside Ladybug since he has the power of destruction. The idea related to the duo of the black cat and the ladybug was also inspired by one of Astruc's previous romantic relationships. Astruc said that managing the situation created by Cat Noir's two identities alongside Ladybug's two selves in terms of romance was "a lot of fun". He stated that pairs of superheroes like the one Cat Noir forms with Ladybug are rare in television series, adding that people enjoy the love game between the two characters. Astruc commented that a romantic relationship between Adrien and Marinette would be fragile and intricate as long as there was a villain in the series; he said that such a relationship would need to be handled carefully and would be able to happen only under certain circumstances.
Cat Noir's chibi form appearing in the series was created by character designer Angie Nasca while the show "was still in the development phase"; according to Nasca, "the series grew from those initial sketches" portraying the two lead characters.
Jeremy Zag, the producer of "Miraculous", stated that the love situation Adrien created alongside Marinette, their superhero alter egos, and their secrets are some of the main parts of the show. Sébastien Thibaudeau, the writing director of "Miraculous", mentioned that Adrien frequently makes him emotional because of his difficult life. He said Cat Noir is the character that brings humor into the story, contrasting with Ladybug, who is more serious. Thibaudeau stated that Adrien can express himself when he is transformed into Cat Noir. Fred Lenoir, a writer of the series, commented that Adrien's relationship with Marinette, depicted as both civilians and superheroes, and the misunderstanding resulted from it represent the central part of the story. André Lake Mayer, ZAG America's president of global consumer products, stated that Cat Noir is one of children's preferred "relatable heroes"; she felt that the fans would "love taking on" Cat Noir's persona in the "Miraculous" mobile running game. Nicole D'Andria, who contributed to the writing of a "Miraculous" comic book, described Cat Noir as a "fantastic" character "that everyone can look up to". Giulia Adragna, the creator of an Italian "Miraculous" comic book series, said that she had liked Cat Noir the most after seeing images from the series for the first time, commending that he looked like a male version of Catwoman. Adragna stated that Adrien, both in his superhero form and as his civilian self, is her favorite "Miraculous" character. She commented that while Adrien could have been a typically unlikable character since he comes from a fine family and is a model, he instead is depicted as innocent, caring, and kind.
Voice.
Bryce Papenbrook voices Adrien in the English dub of the series. Papenbrook said that it is "always great to be Cat Noir", stating that he had "so much fun" with him. He described "Miraculous" as "a great show" with "fun animation and a lot of puns". He felt that the show's English dub contains the most puns out of all versions of the series. Papenbrook stated that he enjoys "making those cheesy puns", and he commented that he was "sneaking as many cat puns as possible into the show", feeling that the viewers like them. Papenbrook said he loves "Miraculous", mentioning that he knew "a ton of people [had] been waiting for that show". He described the second season of the series as "really, really good". He stated that he was "very excited" since "Miraculous" had won a Teen Choice Award. Papenbrook commented that he was "excited to see more bad guys" in the next seasons of the series, stating that the writers are "creative" with the people depicted in the show. He felt that the "Miraculous Chibi" series is "exciting" and "looks really cool".
When the casting for the show began, many voice actors auditioned for the roles of the main characters, including Adrien's. Ezra Weisz, the voice director of "Miraculous", said the staff responsible for the casting had wanted Adrien's voice to sound young and to denote self-assurance in his superhero form without making him seem overly proud; he further commented that the staff had wished to find an actor whose voice could separate Adrien's civilian self from his superhero identity. According to Weisz, he and Papenbrook had known each other for a long time. When the staff was trying to find a fitting voice for Adrien, Weisz felt that Papenbrook would be very suited for it. He stated that Papenbrook's voice sounds "the right age", adding that he has "the right acting abilities" for this role and "is very, very skilled in the booth". Weisz said that Papenbrook does "a phenomenal job" on voicing Adrien.
Jared Wolfson, the executive producer of "Miraculous", commented that Papenbrook has a lot of "energy" and characterized him as "a great guy". He further described him as "very happy", "personable", and "energetic", stating that Papenbrook "loves what he does" and is "very passionate" about "being Adrien and Cat Noir".

While heading toward its entrance, he notices an elderly man in need of assistance and offers to help him. Unknown to Adrien at the time, the man is , the guardian of the magical objects named the Miraculouses, and this has been just a test to show who would deserve to become a superhero. Because of Adrien's kind gesture, Master Fu decides to give him a ring called the Cat Miraculous. After realizing he is in possession of the box that contains the ring, Adrien opens it and suddenly a black cat-like creature who presents himself as appears; he is a magical being known as a . When wearing the ring, Adrien can transform into a superhero with the help of Plagg's powers.
Adrien is eager to transform and immediately does so. His superhero outfit derives from Plagg's appearance, representing a black cat. Not long after he transforms for the first time, he meets his new superhero partner, Ladybug, with whom he rapidly falls in love. During their first meeting, Adrien introduces his superhero alias, Cat Noir. Unknown to him, Ladybug is Marinette, one of Adrien's classmates who has a big crush on him.

Reception.
Critical response.
Adrien's character has received a generally positive critical response, with writers characterizing him as an "iconic", "great", beautiful, "relatable", and "beyond famous" character. "ComicsVerse"s Michele Kirichanskaya said that Adrien's "character is essential to the overall charm captured by the show". She praised that Cat Noir had been inspired by an existent superhero, Catwoman. Kirichanskaya stated that Cat Noir had been created following the "superhero logic", on account of which heroes wearing masks "must combat superpowered foes". She wrote that because of Cat Noir's "transformation scene", the "Magical Girl trope" present in the story is "not limited by gender". Robert Lloyd of "Los Angeles Times" characterized Adrien as "an unspoiled rich kid who moonlights as a model". He stated that "the male hero wears a catsuit, cat ears and a sort of tail", which "may seem a surprisingly foreign and/or feminine touch" to the American audience. "Le Figaro"s Damien Mercereau described Adrien as a sensitive and unassuming character, commenting that he becomes resourceful and self-assured as Cat Noir. "ComicsAlliance" writer Elle Collins praised that Cat Noir's costume "makes him look like Selina Kyle's boy sidekick". She said many people have "the false belief that superheroes are for boys", deeming it predictable that Cat Noir was publicized as Ladybug's "equal co-star of the show" although the initial title of the series had highlighted "the female character as the real star, with Cat Noir as her fellow costumed hero and possible love interest". Collins stated that she was "interested to see" whether Cat Noir had "a Magical Girl transformation" similar to Ladybug's. Emily Ashby of "Common Sense Media" characterized Adrien in his civilian form as a normal child "facing typical tween troubles", such as "keeping up with school, making friends, and dealing with difficult peers". "Comic Book Resources" writer Nathan Dodge described Cat Noir as "a stylish cat-themed hero". Emily Auten of "Nerd Much?" praised Bryce Papenbrook's voice acting, stating that Adrien's voice is done "especially well" along with Marinette's and viewing this as "definitely a plus since the entire plot focuses on them". She said that Adrien's character is "very interesting", "especially in contrast with" his superhero identity, and wrote that Adrien is a "great" choice for a protagonist "even without the romantic subplot". Auten characterized Cat Noir as one of the "best" parts of the series, and she stated that his "lengthy transformation" sequence never seems overly extended and is "fun to see". An "El Intransigente" writer said Adrien's character shows that money does not buy happiness. Adrien was commented to "teach kids about confidence", and he was regarded as "cute and fun to watch". He was deemed "mild-mannered", and "shy". Cat Noir was described as loyal, and as Ladybug's Partner in fighting Crime. When an episode depicted him in a stadium, Cat Noir was stated to win alongside Ladybug against his opponent as easily as the professional football club Paris Saint-Germain F.C. did in the Ligue 1 French championship.
Adrien's relationship with Marinette has been praised, both as civilians and as superheroes. Cat Noir's interactions with Ladybug have been commended, being regarded as "absolutely adorable to watch". Michele Kirichanskaya characterized Adrien as Marinette's "crime-fighting partner" and described the "dynamics" between the two of them as "captivating". She said Adrien's "romantic dynamic" with Marinette "contributes much" to the show's "drama and comedy", adding that the series "creates a love quadrangle by only using two individuals". Emily Ashby stated that Cat Noir makes "a charming crime-fighting duo" with Ladybug and said "their relationship easily eclipses the show's action in entertainment value". She felt that watching Adrien's relationship with Marinette evolve is "fun". Ashby stated that the viewers "have to forgive the characters' naivety" and accept "that merely an eye mask and some cat ears" prevent Adrien and Marinette from recognizing one another. She said that Cat Noir's crush on Ladybug "is a sweet example of young love". María Merino of "Okdiario" commented that Adrien's relationship with Marinette is one of the factors that attract viewers to this series. Emily Auten thought that the "romantic subplot" is made "even more interesting" by Cat Noir's crush on Ladybug, with "the chemistry between both of them being one of the many highlights" in the show. She wrote that Cat Noir forms alongside Ladybug "one of the best duos" she had ever seen in a cartoon. The love situation Adrien created alongside Marinette was stated to bring "a fun dynamic" into the series, and was regarded as sweet; it was described as one of the "old clichés on the genre", and was viewed as similar to "the classic Clark-Lois-Superman triangle".
Popularity and merchandise.
Paul Marciano, the chairman and chief creative officer of Guess, said that the viewers' understanding of Adrien's relationship with Marinette and their superhero alter egos make this series "intriguing". A life-size wax statue portraying Cat Noir has been displayed at the Musée Grévin. He has been depicted on buses and billboards. A Snapchat filter inspired by Cat Noir has been developed. Cosplays of Adrien have been created, both as his civilian self, and under his superhero identity. Meet-and-greet sessions containing Cat Noir have taken place, including at a theme park.

Cañadón Calcáreo Formation

The Cañadón Calcáreo Formation is an Oxfordian to Kimmeridgian-aged geologic formation, from the Cañadón Asfalto Basin in Chubut Province, Argentina, a rift basin that started forming since the earliest Jurassic. It was formerly thought to date into the Cretaceous, but the age has been revised with Uranium Lead dating as likely being solely Late Jurassic in age.
It is a subunit of the Sierra de Olte Group, close to the city Cerro Condor in the Chubut Province of northwestern Patagonia, in southern Argentina. The formation is composed primarily of fluvial sandstones alongside shales and volcanic tuffites
The formation preserves fishes, crocodylomorphs and some dinosaur taxa, as well as conifers.
Geology.
The Cañadón Calcáreo Formation is composed mainly of fluvial deposits, that are found close to the Cañadón Asfalto Formation. While originally thought to be part of the Cañadón Asfalto, there is a lack of calcareous rocks, and the geologic faulting and folding is weaker. The Cañadón Calcáreo Formation is overlain by the Chubut Group, the rocks of which lack synsedimentary deformation. The area of the Cañadón Calcáreo also includes lacustrine and palustrine rocks, including shales, pelites, psammites and coarse clastics.
Age.
The age of the Cañadón Calcáreo Formation was originally presumed to be Late Jurassic, probably Kimmeridgian to Tithonian in age. However, it has also been suggested to span the entire Late Jurassic, beginning in the Oxfordian, although this could also be because of the uncertainty of the youngest age Cañadón Asfalto Formation. A 2009 study of the palynology from a section of the formation revealed an age that was Hauterivian, which suggests that the formation extends from the Late Jurassic into the Early Cretaceous.
Dinosaurs.
An unnamed titanosauriform sauropod is also known from the Cañadón Calcáreo Formation. It is known from a single humerus.
Abelisaurid theropods and a stegosaur are also known from the formation.

Marinette Dupain-Cheng

Marinette Dupain-Cheng is a fictional character and the female protagonist of the animated television series ' created by Thomas Astruc. She is depicted as a French-Chinese teenage student who aspires to become a fashion designer, she is 14 years old, and is 1.35 tall... And whose parents own a bakery. After she passes the test of , the keeper of the magical objects named the Miraculouses, by helping him, Marinette is chosen as a soon-to-be superheroine alongside Cat Noir. As a result, she is given a pair of earrings known as the Ladybug Miraculous, which when worn grants Marinette the ability to transform into Ladybug"', her superheroine alias. Ladybug and Cat Noir's goal is to protect Paris from the villain and defeat him altogether. Unknown to Marinette, Cat Noir's civilian identity is Adrien Agreste, a classmate whom she has feelings for. As the holder of a Miraculous, Marinette is assisted by a small red creature resembling a ladybug called , who is a magical being known as a . As Ladybug, Marinette's signature ability is creation. Marinette appears in most "Miraculous" media, including the main series, the mobile running game, and the comic books.
Marinette's character was inspired by a young woman wearing a ladybug-themed T-shirt who once worked with Astruc. After creating a drawing that portrayed her as a ladybug-themed superheroine, Astruc felt this would be a good character, especially as he was not aware of the existence of another ladybug-related superhero. The woman's haircut served as inspiration for Marinette's hairstyle as well. Marinette is voiced by Cristina Vee in the English dub, while Anouck Hautbois voices her in the French version of the series.
Marinette's character has received a generally positive critical response, with writers characterizing her as a role model for viewers and as a great protagonist; both her civilian self and her superheroine identity have been praised. However, others criticize her for coming off as a stalker towards her crush Adrien Agreste. Meet-and-greet sessions containing Ladybug have taken place. Several pieces of merchandise based on her, such as accessories, clothing items, and action figures, have been created. 
Development.
Concept and creation.
The superheroine identity of Marinette Dupain-Cheng, Ladybug, was inspired by a young woman wearing a T-shirt with a ladybug depicted on it; she belonged to the production team of another show that also included Thomas Astruc, the creator of the animated television series "". Astruc stated that he had befriended her, and following this they had started creating and "exchanging ladybug-themed sticky notes"; a note drawn by Astruc portrayed the woman as a ladybug-themed superhero. Astruc did not know of the existence of a ladybug-related superhero and felt this character would be good. As a result, Ladybug's character was conceptualized. Astruc thought that a superhero based on this idea had not previously been created because of not being sufficiently masculine. Marinette's hairstyle was also conceived using the woman's haircut as a model. Astruc said that Ladybug's power was connected to luck since ladybugs are associated with good luck. He commented that Ladybug's character is comparable to Spider-Man.
Astruc stated that while Marinette is a girl of action, this does not prevent her from wearing pink. He characterized Ladybug as an "awesome", special, very positive, and bright character. He also described her as his favorite character from the series. Astruc hoped that children would view Ladybug as a positive example, and that she would become the mascot of Paris, being found on flyers at museums' entrances to inspire children to visit them. In regard to Marinette and Adrien Agreste, he commented that he had wished to depict "sunny", inspiring characters. Astruc mentioned that Ladybug is one of the two most "powerful teenagers" alongside Cat Noir since she has the power of creation. He stated that handling the dynamics between Marinette's and Adrien's identities was entertaining. Astruc said that couples of superheroes like the one consisting of Ladybug and Cat Noir are uncommon in shows, and he felt that the viewers enjoy the love situation formed between the two of them. A source of inspiration for the duo of the ladybug and the black cat was one of Astruc's previous romantic relationships. Astruc stated that, as long there was a villain in the show, a romantic relationship between Marinette and Adrien would be able to happen only under certain circumstances and would need to be handled carefully, commenting that such a relationship would be brittle and complicated.
Ladybug's costume was difficult to animate when it came to the show's original 2D version since it was red with black dots; the dots had to be in certain places and had to remain unmoved. In the 3D version, this problem disappeared since there was a model moving. In the 2D version, Marinette was supposed to be older than she currently is in the 3D version. The chibi design of Ladybug from the series was conceived by character designer Angie Nasca. The bakery of Marinette's family was inspired by a real-life Parisian bakery.
Astruc commented that deciding how Ladybug would use a certain item created with the help of her Miraculous to defeat the villain takes a quarter of the writers' working time for an episode; Sébastien Thibaudeau, the writing director of "Miraculous", stated that Ladybug is intelligent since she manages to do what in reality several people can think of only when collaborating with each other. According to Thibaudeau, the writers wanted Marinette to not be based on clichés and to resemble a contemporary girl, able to create things and desiring to achieve something in life; they also wished Marinette's transformation into a self-assured superhero to show that people can change and become stronger. Marinette is also meant to highlight that one has to fight and be open-minded and smart in order to be successful in life. Thibaudeau said Marinette tries to improve Adrien's difficult life. Fred Lenoir, also writing for "Miraculous", stated that Marinette's relationship with Adrien, both as civilians and as superheroes, is the main part of the show. Astruc mentioned that the third season of the series served as a test for Marinette; Mélanie Duval, another writer of "Miraculous", commented that Marinette had a lot of obstacles to overcome in that season.
Jeremy Zag, the president of the animation studio Zagtoon, described Marinette as "a fresh and modern girl character who is in line with kids' and teens' lives today". The first two images depicting Ladybug released by Zag, one showing her portrait and one featuring her on a rooftop in Paris, received enough attention to surround the world. Zag said the love situation that Marinette created alongside Adrien, their superhero identities, and their secrets represent some of the main parts of the story. Jared Wolfson, the executive producer of "Miraculous", stated that the audience of girls had been waiting for "someone like a Spider-Man to come along" and that, because of Ladybug's character, they can now transform into her, becoming "stronger" and making "an effect in the world". With regard to Ladybug's character, Aton Soumache, the chief executive officer of the company Method Animation, said the producers had wished to "create a [glamorous] superhero character with a real European flair with Paris as backdrop", as a result of the previous lack of an action series centered on a female superhero.
Nicole D'Andria, a contributor to the creation of a "Miraculous" comic book, said that Ladybug is an admirable character. ZAG America's president of global consumer products, André Lake Mayer, stated that children are fond of Ladybug's character, and that the fans would enjoy playing as Ladybug in the "Miraculous" mobile running game. She felt that Ladybug "is instantaneously empowering to all women, all ages", saying that she "is mesmerizing both as Marinette and as Ladybug". Mayer stated that "even without knowing the story", "she is instinctively familiar, authentic and strong", adding that "Ladybug is an icon for wholesome girl empowerment". She also characterized Ladybug as "relatable", and as "unique".
Voice.
Cristina Vee voices Marinette in the English dub. Vee stated that she loves Marinette, describing her as one of her favorite characters that she voiced. She said Marinette reminds her of the character Sailor Moon, commenting that "working on the show" had given her "the same feelings" as the ones she had experienced while "watching "Sailor Moon" growing up as a kid". She stated that she had auditioned for Marinette's role considerably, most likely more than she had previously done for other characters. Vee said she had first obtained the script for the audition around a year before being cast, adding that she had not received a reply after auditioning. Following this, she had acquired the script once again, and after the audition, she received two callbacks. She stated that ever since she had seen Marinette's character design and the script, she had known that "whoever was cast as this character, Ladybug, would be the luckiest girl", precisely "the luckiest voice actress". After reading the script for the first time, Vee felt that Marinette was a version "on paper" of herself. Vee said she had fallen in love with Ladybug immediately. She commented that she had not been aware of this show's existence before auditioning for Marinette's role, which surprised her since she kept herself up to date with anime-related news. After auditioning and before receiving the callbacks, she found out about the anime promotional video of the series. After seeing the video, she started wanting the role all the more.
Vee said that she resembles Marinette very much, sometimes being "pretty shy and clumsy" and stumbling over her "words and feet". While she liked that Marinette is affectionate toward Adrien and "mixes up her words sometimes", Vee regarded "fighting crime as Ladybug" as "her favorite part" of voicing her, stating that she enjoyed the moments when Marinette says her specific phrases for her transformation into Ladybug and for using her signature superhero ability. She mentioned that Marinette and Adrien learning about each other's identities would be "exciting", adding that she wished to see how they would "work together in a different way to fight crime". Vee characterized this show as "amazing", stating that she had never seen an animation like this before and that "every episode is just so beautiful". She described the second season of the series as "awesome". Regarding the , Vee hoped it would contain moments centered on Marinette and Adrien.
Many voice actors auditioned for the roles of the main characters, including Marinette's, when the casting for the series started. Ezra Weisz, the voice director of "Miraculous", said that the staff in charge of the casting had wished Marinette to sound confident yet not excessively proud as a superhero, and they had wanted to find someone whose voice would be able to distinguish Marinette's civilian identity from her superhero self. Weisz mentioned that Vee does a remarkable job on voicing Marinette. He stated that Vee "has a young heroine quality to her voice", adding that he had always wished Vee "to be an actual superhero" since he felt she is a superhero "in real life". Weisz commented that Vee portrays the idea of a nervous teenager who becomes embarrassed around the person they love very well.

Nevertheless, she learns how to act as a superhero shortly after that and introduces her superhero alias, Ladybug. Marinette's superhero outfit derives from Tikki's appearance, resembling a ladybug. Marinette is in love with Adrien, a boy from her class whom she gets nervous around. Unknown to Marinette, Adrien is actually her superhero partner, Cat Noir, who fancies Ladybug. Since Marinette is not aware of Cat Noir's civilian identity, she constantly rejects his advances toward her. Ladybug and Cat Noir's objective is to protect Paris from , a man who has the ability to turn people into supervillains; he wishes to acquire Ladybug's and Cat Noir's Miraculouses, and, unknown to them, is actually Adrien's father.

Reception.
Critical response.
Critical reception of Marinette has been generally positive, with writers describing her as a famous character, and as "pretty", charismatic, clever, sweet, and inventive. Emily Ashby of "Common Sense Media" characterized Marinette as "patient" and "kind". "ComicsVerse" writer Michele Kirichanskaya felt that the series "takes the time to address Marinette's heritage" in "a subtle and respectful manner", citing the "moments when she struggles with speaking Chinese" and has "cultural miscommunications with relatives". Kirichanskaya wrote that Marinette's complete name when "translated from both Chinese and French languages" is "appropriate for a girl whose family owns a bakery". She described Marinette as "loyal and devoted to her friends and family". Kirichanskaya said Marinette being "an aspiring fashion designer" who makes "new creations in her spare time" shows that "feminine interests [do not] necessarily detract from superheroic qualities", deeming this "a positive message for male and female viewers alike". She thought that the feelings Marinette has for Adrien "only define one aspect of her character". Caroline Gourdin of "La Libre Belgique" stated that Marinette's character is one of the main aspects of the series, adding that she can appeal to both girls and boys. "Nerd Much?" writer Emily Auten felt that "Marinette's shoujo-like crush on Adrien" is one of the "small aspects that anime fans can appreciate" in this show. Auten wrote that "Marinette takes center stage" as a protagonist despite the lack of heroines in television series; she also stated that "Marinette is a great female protagonist". Auten said Marinette is "very well-written", stating that she is "a great role model" for both children and adults "to look up to and relate with". She praised Cristina Vee's role as Marinette's voice actress. An "El Intransigente" writer said that the applauded protagonist of this series is a girl, unlike how it happens in other shows, and that Marinette has a big heart. Marinette was commented to have "innocent optimism". She was described as a very important character for children from many countries, including France.
Marinette's superhero form, Ladybug, has been commended. Elle Collins of "ComicsAlliance" said the way "Marinette transforms into Ladybug in a series of twirls and poses" resembles how "Sailor Moon and other magical girls always do". She felt that Marinette having "the guidance of some kind of talking ladybug creature" completes "another Magical Girl trope". "Los Angeles Times" writer Robert Lloyd commented that Marinette is a "smart girl" and characterized her superhero form as "a costumed crusader". Michele Kirichanskaya stated that while Marinette initially "appears to be just an ordinary girl", with the help of "a pair of magical earrings" she "can transform into the Miraculous Ladybug, one of Paris's greatest superheroes". She described Marinette as "a bright, talented, creative young woman, trying to balance her daily life with all the responsibilities that entail being France's greatest superheroine". Kirichanskaya characterized Ladybug as "an incredible hero" who is "fluid and confident in battle". She felt that "Marinette embodies the most" of both her ordinary and superhero lives "in a beautiful force of a character". Laura Aasland of "Culture Honey" praised that while Ladybug keeps "groaning at Cat Noir's puns", Marinette has feelings for Adrien. Ella Anders of "BSCkids" said that while "from a glance [Marinette] appears to be a typical high-school teen", she is "a champion of right" in reality. "Epicstream"s Caitlin Donovan described Marinette as "an adorable lead who is genuinely awkward as a civilian" yet "confident as a superhero", feeling this "makes for an interesting contrast". "Best Movie" writer Irene Rosignoli commended Marinette's ability to transform from her shy civilian self into a courageous, confident, and resolute superhero, viewing it as a constructive message for girls throughout the world. Ladybug was characterized as an amazing superhero who can immediately impress the young viewers, and she was deemed capable, brave, and girls' favorite superhero.
Popularity and merchandise.
Bandai's brand management vice president, Kenji Washida, described Marinette as "a quirky but lovable girl growing up, going to school and having first crushes", stating that she is a character "girls can relate to"; he said Marinette's superhero alter ego is "someone they want to be". Washida viewed "the concept of a young girl as a superhero" as "a game-changer in both toys and entertainment". Guess's chief creative officer and chairman, Paul Marciano, praised Marinette's secret identity and her relationship with Adrien. The licensing director of Gemma International, Tim Rudd-Clarke, characterized Ladybug as "a strong and empowered female superhero" who "fills a huge gap in the market that has been vacant for quite some time". The PGS Entertainment staff described Marinette as a female "lead superhero" who "instills positive values". A life-size wax statue depicting Ladybug has been showcased at the Musée Grévin. A Snapchat filter inspired by her has been created. Ladybug has been portrayed on buses. Indoor playgrounds based on Ladybug and Cat Noir have been built. Meet-and-greets containing Ladybug have been arranged, including at a theme park. She has served as inspiration for a Christmas event, and for face painting. Cosplays of her have been made.
Several pieces of merchandise inspired by Marinette's civilian and superhero identities have been created, including action figures, clothing items, accessories, masks, and stickers. Figurines portraying Ladybug have been developed by Funko, and by Burger King. Toys based on her have been produced, such as Kinder Surprise toys, and a toy telephone. Pez candy dispensers inspired by her have been launched. A game based on Ladybug and other "Miraculous" characters has been released.

Traklosia

Traklosia is a genus of nematodes. The genus was originally circumscribed in 1961 under the name "Robertia"; L. Travassos and G. R. Kloss created this genus for their newly-described species "R. leiperi". The nomen novum, "Traklosia", was created for this genus in 2015 — "Robertia" was an invalid name due to a senior homonym. It consists of three species found in Brazil and Cuba, and they are parasites of millipedes.
Taxonomic history.
In 2015, Ernest C. Bernard and Gary Phillips coined "Traklosia" as nomen novum for "Robertia". The word "Traklosia" comes from the first three letters in the surnames of L. Travassos and G. R. Kloss. Travassos and Kloss had circumscribed the genus "Robertia" for their newly-described species "Robertia leiperi" in 1961. The generic name "Robertia" was unavailable because a senior homonym, the synapsid genus "Robertia", was named in 1948.
"Traklosia" is the type genus of the family Traklosiidae, which was changed from Robertiidae. The genus "Triumphalisnema" is in the same family. Travassos and Kloss initially placed their genus "Robertia" in a new subfamily Robertiinae in the family Thelastomatidae. George Poinar Jr. recognized Robertiidae as its own family in 1977. In 1989, Adamson synonymized Robertiidae with Thelastomatidae. The family Traklosiidae is thought to be valid according to Gary Phillips and colleagues.
Species.
, three species are recognized in the genus "Traklosia". All of them were initially described with the generic name "Robertia". The three species are: "T. cubana", "T. leiperi", and "T. longicauda". The type species is "T. leiperi", under its original combination "Robertia leiperi". "T. cubana" was described in 1984 by S. E. Spiridonov of the USSR Academy of Science. "T. leiperi" was described in 1961 by L. Travassos and G. R. Kloss of the Oswaldo Cruz Institute. "T. longicauda" was described in 1995 by Nayla García, Alberto Coy, and Marianela Álvarez, all parasitologists at the Cuban Academy of Sciences.
Diagnosis and description.
Females in this genus are very small. The female reproductive system has only one genital tract. Their uteri are parallel and oriented to their posterior. They bear a single egg at a time, and eggs are ovalish. Their vagina points anteriorly and is in the posterior third of their body (excluding the tail). Males have a caudal extremity which suddenly narrows half-way making its end thread-like. Their genital cone is well developed.
Distribution.
"Traklosia" is found in South America and the West Indies. "T. cubana" and "T. longicauda" are both found in Cuba: "T. cubana" has been recorded in Guantánamo along the "Carretera Central" between Imías and Baracoa, and "T. longicauda" has been recorded in the National Botanical Garden in Havana. "T. leiperi" has been recorded in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro.
Hosts.
"Traklosia" species infect hosts in the orders Coleoptera and Diplopoda. "T. cubana" and "T. longicauda" have both been found in the millipede genus "Rhinocricus": "T. cubana" has been found in an unspecified "Rhinocricus" species and "T. longicauda" has been found in "R. duvernoyi". "T. leiperi" has been found in the millipede species "Eurydesmus ruidus".

Thirty years ago, Sean's brother, Sam, went missing. Having since worked his way up and been commissioned as an Inspector in the CID's Special Investigation Section, Sean gained access to narrow down his search to Bangkok, Thailand in hope of reuniting with his long - lost brother. On one such trip, Sean encounters Lynn, a jaded, self - serving tour leader who makes him out to be a pervert and child kidnapper, and gets him arrested. There they meet Aut, a high - flying, hot - shot Thai Inspector who seems to care more about his image than police work and, at the same time, is suspiciously familiar with the local gangs. Thus their lives collided and become intertwined, and what started as one man's search for his brother, quickly turns into a dangerous foray into the underbelly of an international human trafficking syndicate.

Fury of the Jungle

Fury of the Jungle is a 1933 American adventure film. It was directed by Roy William Neill and co-written by Dore Schary from a story by Horace McCoy.
Plot.
A love triangle story set in Malango, a remote jungle village in South America harboring a diverse assortment of European expats and criminal types, controlled by the cruel Taggart (Alan Dinehart). The heroine, Joan Leesom (Peggy Shannon), arrives on a river steamer with her brother, Arthur, in search of a lost city. Arthur has contracted a febrile illness and they are forced to disembark in the village, staying in the hut of "Lucky" Allen (Donald Cook), an escaped convict and former Marine who seemingly cannot abide women. Taggart, wanting to possess Joan, sees that the local doctor, Parrish (Dudley Digges), fails to help Arthur in time to save his life, leaving Joan alone with Lucky, with whom she falls in love. Lucky, feeling sympathy for Joan, endeavors to secure his passage with her out of the village by heading into the bush to collect animal pelts. Meanwhile, Taggart duels a convicted murderer, Frenchy, over Joan, killing him. On Lucky's return, Taggart attempts to frame him for the theft of a wallet. Parrish intervenes and is thrown to the crocodiles. Finally, Chita (Toshia Mori), a local woman ill-used by Taggart, reveals to her people the extent of Taggart's machinations, with the result that the villagers ensure that he receives Parrish's fate. Joan and Lucky then are able to escape from Malango and marry.

SS Clan Alpine (1899)

Clan Alpine was a steam ship built in 1899 by the William Doxford &amp; Sons of Pallion. She was the second ship named "Clan Alpine" in service with the Clan Line used on their Oriental routes.
Design and Construction.
In 1899 Clan Line sold their old steamer "Clan Alpine", and placed an order with William Doxford &amp; Sons of Pallion to build three ships for them (future "Clan Alpine", "Clan Farquhar" and "Clan Urquhart"). The ship was launched on 22 September 1899 (25 September 1899 according to other source), with Miss Greta Doxford, daughter of William Theodore Doxford, being the sponsor. The vessel was commissioned in November of the same year. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . "Clan Alpine" was assessed at 3,587 GRT and . The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 330 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to .
Operational history.
In early 1900s, the Clan Line operated two main routes between United Kingdom and her colonies in the East. The first one was a direct route from the home ports through the Strait of Gibraltar, Suez Canal and to the ports of India and Ceylon. The second one involved sailing down the western coast of Africa first to the ports of South African colonies, then onto the ports of Ceylon and India, and occasional trips to Australia.
Upon delivery, "Clan Alpine" proceeded to Middlesbrough and from there to Glasgow for loading, where she arrived on 18 November 1899. From there, the ship sailed to Liverpool and Manchester to load more cargo. She departed from Manchester to Bombay for her maiden journey on 12 December 1899, passing through Suez Canal on 30 December and arriving in Bombay on 13 January 1900. After calling at several Indian ports "Clan Alpine" left for England, passed through Suez Canal on 13 February and arrived in Dunkirk on 3 March. After unloading the ship proceeded to England and arrived at Greenock on 15 March. After a brief stop, the ship left Greenock on 22 March 1900, stopped to load cargo at Liverpool and departed from there for Cape Town on 29 March. After calling at various South African ports the ship sailed to Ceylon via Mauritius and arrived at Galle on 3 July. From Galle the ship continued on to India including Madras, where she arrived on 28 July. From India "Clan Alpine" departed for England via Colombo and arrived in London on 8 September 1900 before continuing on to Glasgow which she reached on 22 September. She soon departed for another trip, leaving from Liverpool for Calcutta on 6 October 1900.
"Clan Alpine" continued service on both routes through the rest of her career.
On 22 November 1908 "Clan Alpine" departed Liverpool for South Africa. On 11 December 1908 it was announced that "Clan Alpine" was chartered to transport wheat from South Australia to England and Europe. The vessel arrived at Cape Town on 19 December 1908 from Liverpool, left there on 23 December, calling at Mossel Bay and Port Elizabeth and arriving at East London on 31 December 1908. "Clan Alpine" departed from East London on 2 January 1909 and continued on to Australia. She arrived at Adelaide from East London in South Africa on 23 January 1909 and immediately continued on to Geelong arriving there three days later.
Sinking.
On 10 June 1917 "Clan Alpine" was torpedoed and sunk 40 nautical miles of Muckle Flugga, Shetland Islands on a passage from Tyne to Archangel with a loss of 8 crew by German submarine SM U-60.

AKB48 Group

, or AKB48 sister groups, shortened to 48 Group, 48g, refers to the sister groups of the Japanese idol girl group AKB48. Based on the same concept "idols you can meet", it currently consists of 5 sister groups in locations across Japan and 7 sister groups in major Asian cities overseas from Indonesia to India. The Japan-based sister groups not only release their own singles, but also perform on some of the AKB48 singles and events. They also send participants in the AKB48 annual events such as the AKB48 general election. The sister groups outside Japan release local-language versions of the AKB48 singles. In their early development, they are often supported by temporary, concurrent members of AKB48, such as Jurina Matsui and Miyuki Watanabe.
History.
AKB48's first sister group, SKE48, was formed in 2008 with its theater in Sakae, Nagoya. SDN48 ("Saturday Night"), NMB48 ("Namba") and HKT48 ("Hakata") were later formed. NGT48 was launched in 2015, and is located in Niigata. STU48, the latest Japanese sister group, was announced during the AKB48 rock-paper-scissors tournament on October 10, 2016. It is based on the seven prefectures adjoining the coast of the Seto Inland Sea and they performed on a ship for a while.
Following the assault on NGT48 member Maho Yamaguchi, the management of AKB48 faced severe public criticism. In response, it was announced to significantly change AKB48 management structures, with individual companies independently running each of the Japanese groups.
In 2011 AKB48's first sister group outside Japan, JKT48, was announced; the group is based in Jakarta, Indonesia. JKT48 was followed by another overseas AKB48 sister group: SNH48, based in Shanghai, China. On June 6, 2016, AKB48 announced it had suspended its partnership with SNH48 due to contract violations. Following the statement, SNH48 declared that it had been completely independent from AKB48 from the beginning and SNH48 management had never made any form of partnership with AKB48. On October 12, 2016, AKS established AKB48 China, based in Shanghai, and named its group AKB48 Team SH.
The creation of the TPE48 was announced on October 10, 2011 in AKB48's official blog. At that time, AKS cooperated with Yoshimoto Kogyo Taipei Branch and expected to start audition work in 2012. However, the two sides failed to reach a consensus in the preparation work, and thus they were discontinued after the second half of 2012. Three new overseas sister groups were announced in March 2016: BNK48, based in Bangkok, Thailand; MNL48, based in Manila, the Philippines and TPE48, based in Taipei, Taiwan. On July 30, 2018, AKS canceled a joint venture and license agreement with TPE48's management and created AKB48 Team TP. The formation of CGM48, named after and based in Chiang Mai, Thailand, as a domestic sister group of BNK48 was announced in Chiang Mai on 2 June 2019.
On December 27, 2017, Yui Yokoyama, the general manager of AKB48 and former captain of Team A, announced the formation of MUM48, based in Mumbai, India, in 2018, through a Showroom live broadcast. On June 19, 2019, MUB48, based on Mumbai replacing MUM48, and DEL48, based on Delhi, was announced. In October 2020, most of the members have already opened their personal Instagram account leading to rumours about disbandment. Deepak Nandal, DEL48 producer, confirmed YKBK48 has closed DEL48 and will terminate the members’ contract at the end of October due to the Corona Virus.
On June 21, 2018, AKS announced the formation of SGO48, based in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), Vietnam.
AKB48 Group also has their "official" rival group : the Sakamichi Series, produced by the same producer. The Sakamichi Series consists of 3 girl groups : Nogizaka46, as the main group and sister groups Sakurazaka46 and Hinatazaka46. 
SNH48 Group is also known to be a big rival against AKB48 Group: After SNH48 created their sister groups BEJ48, GNZ48, SHY48, CKG48 and IDOLS Ft, the group got more recognition in China. Their single "Forest Theorem" was bought 200,000 times in just a few minutes.
"Produce 48" and Iz*One.
On June 15, 2018, the AKB48 groups participated in the Korean reality competition show "Produce 48", which acted as the third season for the Mnet series "Produce 101". The show brought in 96 girls to compete for a spot in a 12 member girl group that would promote in both Korea and Japan for two and a half years. Of those 96 contestants, 57 were from Korean talent agencies while 39 were from AKB48 groups.
On August 31, 2018, the show's final episode aired and the final contestants were chosen to debut in a new group named Iz*One. Among the 12 members chosen to debut were AKB48's Hitomi Honda, HKT48's Nako Yabuki and HKT48's Sakura Miyawaki. The group was an immediate success, as their debut showcase at the Olympic Hall was sold out in minutes. Their first extended play "COLOR*IZ" was released on October 29, 2018 and sold over 34,000 units as reported by Hanteo Chart, setting a new record for the highest number of albums sold on the first day of a Korean girl group's debut release. The music video for the lead single "La Vie en Rose" achieved more than 4.5 million views within 24 hours of its release on YouTube, making it the most-watched debut music video by a Korean act in 24 hours. Since their debut, the group has earned multiple awards, including best rookie group of the year at the Mnet Asian Music Awards.
The group was scheduled to release their first studio album on November 11. However, the release was postponed due to the Mnet vote manipulation investigation. Investigations revealed that the "Produce 48" producer Ahn Joon-young had selected the twelve members of Iz*One from the top 20 just before the airing of the finale. As a result, Iz*One's showcases, promotions, and several guest appearances were cancelled or put on hold, which included the release of their concert film, "Eyes on Me: The Movie", and their Japanese promotions. On January 6, 2020, the members' agencies and CJ ENM reached an agreement to resume the group's activities.

Frøya (island)

Frøya is an island in Frøya municipality in Trøndelag county, Norway. The island makes up about 63% of the land area of Frøya municipality. The island lies in a large archipelago of islands in the Frøyhavet sea, just northwest of the entrance to the Trondheimsfjorden. The Frøyfjorden lies to the south of the island and that separates it from the large island of Hitra.
The island is rocky with heather-covered moorland as well as marshes and lakes. There are no naturally forested areas on the island. The highest point on the island is Besselvassheia, at above sea level. The southern and eastern coasts are relatively smooth, but the northern coast is very jagged with many fjords and coves. Sletringen Lighthouse lies at the southwestern tip of the island.
The island is connected to the mainland via the Frøya Tunnel which connects it to the neighboring island of Hitra. The island of Hitra is then connected to the mainland by the Hitra Tunnel. 
Name.
The name of the island (and municipality) comes from Norse mythology. Although "Frøya" is a variant of the name of the Norse goddess Freyja, the Old Norse form of the name of the island was "Frøy" or "Frey" (the ending "-a" in the modern form is actually the definite article - so the meaning of "Frøya" is 'the Frøy'). Therefore, the name of the island probably has the same root as the name of the Norse god Freyr, brother to Freyja. The names originally were titles: "lord" or "lady". The oldest meaning of the common word was "(the one) in front; the foremost, the leading" and here in the sense "the island in front of Hitra". Until 1906 the island and municipality name was spelled "Frøien" ("-en" is the definite article in Danish-Norwegian).

The series stars Nathan Fillion, Alyssa Diaz, Richard T. Jones, Titus Makin Jr., Mercedes Mason, Melissa O'Neil, Afton Williamson, Mekia Cox, Shawn Ashmore and Eric Winter. "The Rookie" premiered on October 16, 2018. The first season ran until April 16, 2019. The second season ran from September 29, 2019, to May 10, 2020. The third season ran from January 3 to May 16, 2021. 
In May 2021, the series was renewed for a fourth season which premiered on September 26, 2021.
Premise.
The series follows John Nolan, a forty-five-year-old newly divorced man from Pennsylvania, former owner of a construction company and father of a son in college, who, after inadvertently helping police officers during a bank robbery, moves to Los Angeles to pursue a new career as a police officer in the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). After graduating from the Police Academy as the oldest rookie on the force, Nolan must navigate the dangerous, unpredictable nature of his job and is determined to make it in his new career despite the challenges.
Series lead Nathan Fillion stated during an interview that the drama was inspired by a true story as the LAPD is one of just two agencies that accepts new officers over the age of 37. The man whose story inspired the premise of the show was later revealed to be Bill Norcross, who continues to serve in the LAPD and also as executive producer on "The Rookie".
Production.
Development.
On October 26, 2017, ABC announced a straight-to-series order for "The Rookie", starring "Castle" star Nathan Fillion, and written by "Castle" executive producer and co-showrunner Alexi Hawley. Fillion and Hawley serve as executive producers, along with Mark Gordon, Nicholas Pepper, Michelle Chapman, and Jon Steinberg. The series is produced by ABC Studios and The Mark Gordon Company, and premiered on October 16, 2018. On November 5, 2018, "The Rookie" was picked up for full season of 20 episodes. On May 10, 2019, ABC renewed the series for a second season which premiered on September 29, 2019. On October 28, 2019, the series received a full season order of 20 episodes for the second season.
On May 21, 2020, ABC renewed the series for a third season which premiered on January 3, 2021. On May 14, 2021, ABC renewed the series for a fourth season, which is set to premiere on September 26, 2021.
Casting.
With the series order in October 2017, Fillion was cast as John Nolan. On February 7, 2018, Afton Williamson and Eric Winter were cast as Talia Bishop and Tim Bradford, respectively. They were shortly followed by Melissa O'Neil as Lucy Chen, Richard T. Jones as Sergeant Wade Grey, Titus Makin as Jackson West, Alyssa Diaz as Angela Lopez, and Mercedes Mason as Captain Zoe Andersen.
On August 4, 2019, it was announced that Williamson would not be returning for the second season due to the alleged racial discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual assault she suffered during the first season. On October 2, 2019, Mekia Cox joined the cast as a new series regular, Nyla Harper, for the second season.
Filming.
In January 2018, Liz Friedlander signed on to direct and executive produce the pilot. Production on the pilot began on March 7, 2018, with filming taking place in Los Angeles, Oxnard, Burbank and New York City. On April 15, 2021, police received a call of a possible shooting while filming was taking place between Hartford Avenue and West 5th Street in Los Angeles. Three gunshots were heard by various eyewitnesses and the production crew confirmed no one from the show was injured during the incident. Filming in the area was shut down as a result of the reports but filming continued at other already scheduled locations.
On-set misconduct and harassment allegations.
On July 26, 2019, "TVLine" reported that Afton Williamson, who portrays Talia Bishop, would not be returning for the second season. While the outlet initially claimed that the split was amicable, Williamson, in a lengthy Instagram post, stated that she had left the series due to having "experienced racial discrimination/racially charged inappropriate comments from the hair department." Williamson also alleged that she was sexually harassed by guest star Demetrius Grosse, who portrays Kevin Wolfe in a recurring role, as well as an incident of bullying that escalated into sexual assault at a party; the head of the hair department was identified as Sallie Ciganovich. Williamson claimed that she had gone to the showrunners multiple times with these allegations, but was ignored.
Everyone involved in the allegations denied them. An investigation was commissioned through the law firm Mitchell Sillerberg and Knupp along with a third-party firm, EXTTI, which conducted nearly 400 hours of interviews and examined video and other evidence. The results of the investigation were published on September 17, 2019, which found that the allegations made by Williamson had no merit, and could not be proven. Williamson stood by her claims, calling the results of the investigation "heartbreaking" and postulated that the producers had lied to cover up the truth of what happened.

Brave Frontier 2

 is a mobile role-playing game developed by A-Lim and published by A-Lim for both iOS and Android and DMM Games for Microsoft Windows. It is the sequel to the 2013 game "Brave Frontier", originally released for the franchise's 5th anniversary with Eiji Takahashi returning as both director and producer for the sequel, alongside newer staff. The game is released on February 22, 2018 for iOS and Android and will be released on Q3 2018 for Windows.
Gameplay.
Like the first game to the series, it follows the same gameplay format to Square Enix's "Valkyrie Profile", but differentiates itself from the original such as its story-driven plot and gameplay. Players are allowed to bring up to 5 units in each stage with a "friend" unit in quest mode. Players make friends through friend request. Attacking units in a battle rewards the player with Brave Burst Crystals, and Heart Crystals. After an enemy is defeated, the player proceeds the next stage until the boss, which is required to go complete a level. After completing, players are rewarded with Zel and items, as well as acquiring units from each mission. When players complete the entire area, they'll be rewarded with one gem. However, if players fail a quest, they use one gem to continue. Units have the ability to execute special attacks, known as Brave Bursts and Super Brave Bursts.
In departure to the original game, the game will be the first to feature a double protagonist system, allowing players to play the story of both main protagonist in the same game. a new mechanic known as Xross Brave Burst is introduced, which requires two or more units with mutual relationship to execute stronger attacks. Also, the game features an improved summoner avatar system and can be leveled up through branch evolution and be equipped with various weapons and items. Alongside the improved summoner avatar system is the ability to raise pets as companion in quests, which like units, can be evolvable to become stronger. The game's director, Eiji Takahashi also stated that standard features such as Frontier Hunter, Trials and Arena will also be included in the game's release. But unlike its predecessor, Brave Frontier 2 has no Gacha system to get new units, and relies more on buying new units using in-game currency.
Story.
20 years after the defeat of Karna Masta and the restoration of summoning ability within the Akras Summoner's Hall, deep in the world of Extas, Fabulaska was arrested for copying data on a research forbidden to be accessed when two strange figures helped him in his escape. As this caught the eye of the Akras Summoners Hall back in Elgaia regarding the discovery of the new world, Noel, Lugina and Roy went to Extas to negotiate with the authorities for the capture of Fabulaska, in exchange for Noel's research data regarding the world of Bectas.
10 Years after, the year is A.I.E 300, a strange group called Negress were making their move, destroying countless kingdoms and worlds for their unknown ambitions. Though the Akras Summoners Hall are trying to pin their every move, until a strange gate started opening in Grand Gaia as the Summoners's Hall were sent to investigate. In another world in the Kingdom of Seltavia, Negress sets their goal on the kingdom's capital of Philharme, taking down various soldiers as they proceed with their plan in dominating various worlds. As The King ordered the citizens to escape, two main youth tried to make their escape, each of the kingdom's most powerful knights had fallen due to the mysterious black knight's presence. The main character and his childhood friend, Rin, were protecting the treasure rood underground with the help from Augus and Lory as they were then caught by the black knight. But in the midst of their defeat, Augus used a strange orb to open a portal to another world, and Augus told both the hero and Rin to escape with the orb. However, the black knight commanded Shaia to attack the hero and Rin, distorting the portal as both of them were sucked away into the portal and were separated as they traversed into different worlds. Now, being separated from Rin and being found by the Akras Summoners, humanity's survival rests on the new hero and the Akras Summoners Guild in order to take down the dreaded Negress.
Music.
Unlike the music in "Brave Frontier", which is synthesized, "Brave Frontier 2" will feature a real Orchestra soundtrack done by the Tokyo City Philharmonic Orchestra and composed by Hikoshi Hashimoto, Kenji Ito, Minako Seki, Kaoru Wada, Noriyuki Iwadare, TAMAYO and Tadayoshi Makino.
Development.
The game was first revealed at the December 2016 broadcast of "BureNama", announcing the title logo and brief plans regarding the sequel. Takahashi also expresses his deep thanks regarding the success of the first game saying "In the future even after the new series has been released, the BF that is being enjoyed now, will continue to allow for both existing and new players to play it. We're thinking about various ways, but even with going into a second series, it's conversely unthinkable that we'd close off the product we've done so far until now." At the July 2017 broadcast of BureNama, concept art for the game is shown including two new NPC characters: Roy and Sasha a redesigned battle UI for the game and remastered art for the old units. In the 2017 BraveFest in Osaka in August 2017, the official staff revealed more redone artwork of older units and revamping for the original game's Arena system, as well as streaming of the first Prologue Motion Comic. In the 2017 BraveFest in Tokyo in September 2017, more concept art for units and art for the revamped UI system of the game is revealed alongside the Cross Brave Burst between Vargas and Lava. It also shows new units exclusive for the sequel. The game is scheduled to be released in Q4 2017, but is pushed back to Q1 2018 due to technical issues. Alim later revealed the game's first gameplay footage at the December 2017 broadcast of "BureNama", detailing some of the features such as the basic battle system, Summoner Avatar, the Pet System, Cross Brave Burst, and the ability to buy units.
In an interview with "Famitsu" regarding the game's development, Takahashi stated that "Brave Frontier is a titled type, so you can do a sequel in the form of version up, and of course it was an idea. However, in a conversation I have with Hironobu Sakaguchi in the past, I remembered that he said "I think it's okay to put out a sequel or 2 or 3, even on a smartphone game", and as a result of considering various reasons, this time I wen to a sequel with a completely new work like this." He also said regarding the story and main character that "The first Brave Frontier is focused on the hero in Elgaia and Grand Gaia. But the hero in Brave Frontier 2 is a person living in the kingdom named Zeltabia which is totally different from them."
The game then hosted its Press Release Conference on February 12, 2018, which reveals the game's release date as well as several bonuses that can be obtained in the game itself. To also promote the game in Japan, A-Lim collaborated with Toei Company to produce two promotional videos featuring the 37th Sentai series "Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger", which also marked the reunion of the show's original cast members. The first one is a newly produced episode while the other is a parody of the game done in the style of Super Sentai. Both videos were available limitedly in the game's official YouTube Channel.
Release.
The game is released on both iOS and Android platforms on February 22, 2018, with the PC version be released on Q3 2018. A Pre-release campaign with various rewards that can be used in the game. According to Takahashi, there are no plans for a release outside Japan.
Reception.
The game was ranked 67 within the first day of release on the Apple App Store in Japan.

Dalby State High School

Dalby State High School is a heritage-listed state high school at 28B Nicholson Street, Dalby, Western Downs Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built from 1953 to 1954. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 19 August 2016.
History.
Dalby State High School (SHS) opened on its present site in 1954, due to overcrowding at Dalby State School (est.1861) - which had accommodated a secondary department (or 'high top') since 1914. In 2016 Dalby SHS retains six 1950s buildings, and part of a seventh, which demonstrate the evolution of standard government designs:
It also retains its 1950s site planning; covered links; and paved areas associated with Block F; along with a sports oval and mature perimeter trees. The school has been in continuous operation since establishment.
The traditional land of the Barunggam people, Dalby was established with European settlement of the Darling Downs from 1840. Laid out in 1852, Dalby was resurveyed and named in 1853, and its Town Reserve was declared in August 1855. The first urban land sales were held in 1857, and Dalby became a municipality (the Borough of Dalby) on 29 August 1863.
The growing town soon required a school. National schools, established in 1848 in New South Wales, were continued in Queensland following the colony's creation in 1859. Following the introduction of the Education Act 1860, Queensland's national and public schools grew from four in 1860 to 230 by 1875. The State Education Act 1875 provided for free, compulsory and secular primary education and established the Department of Public Instruction. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress, and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers.
To help ensure consistency and economy, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. From the 1860s until the 1960s, Queensland school buildings were predominantly timber-framed, an easy and cost-effective approach that also enabled the government to provide facilities in remote areas. Standard designs were continually refined in response to changing needs and educational philosophy and Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in climate control, lighting, and ventilation. Standardisation produced distinctly similar schools across Queensland with complexes of typical components.
A school was built in Dalby by public subscription by early 1859, and the Dalby National School (later Dalby State School) opened on 1 June 1861 on Cunningham Street. The 1859 school appears to have been sited elsewhere, east of Myall Creek. In September 1861 the locals voted to transfer the building and land to the Board of Education, to become a vested national school. In non-vested national schools, the Board of Education did not own the building, but usually provided the teacher. From 1875 national schools were referred to as state schools.
Transport improvements had a major effect on the prosperity and growth of Dalby. The extension of the Western railway line from Toowoomba to Dalby in 1868 led to a boom in the town, which had a population of 3500 by the mid-1870s. However, Dalby's population plummeted to 1500 when the line was extended west towards Roma in 1877, and people followed the railhead. Farming was initially inhibited due to a lack of rain, and without refrigeration agricultural produce could not be delivered to distant markets. By 1885 the population was 1296, and this had only recovered to 1416 by 1901. Dalby's population recovered in the early 20th century due to the Queensland Government's enforced break-up of the large pastoral stations, and its construction of branch railway lines, which encouraged closer settlement. Dairying and wheat cultivation expanded, and the development of agriculture led to secondary industries in Dalby. However, the rural economy of the area remained predominantly pastoral until after World War II.
As Dalby grew, so did the state school. A secondary department opened in January 1914. In Queensland, governments were slow to establish state secondary education, considering this to be of little relevance to Queensland's primary industry-based economy. It was not until 1912 that the government instituted a high school system, whereby separate high schools were established in major towns or, where the student population was too small, a primary school was expanded to include a "high top". High tops were an economical measure that provided essentially the same education while utilising already established facilities. In Queensland generally, high schools remained few in number until after World War II.
Over three decades, enrolment at the Dalby State School's high top slowly rose, from 16 students in 1915 to 41 in 1944. Domestic science classes were also added to the secondary department in 1922, and woodwork and commercial courses followed in 1927. Pupils from the wider district outside Dalby also attended these vocational classes, some of which were held at night. In 1934 the high top building (extant in 2016) was shifted, to be parallel to, and slightly behind, the west end of the main school building . Vocational education was a Queensland Government priority to support the development of primary industries; this evolved after World War I into a variety of subjects. Vocational training within primary education began in 1895 with drawing classes and expanded to include domestic sciences, agriculture, and sheet metal and wood working classes. The subjects required a variety of purpose-built facilities and were initially gender segregated. Standard, purpose-designed vocational buildings were first introduced in 1928. In 1936 the Minister for Education permitted students to take vocational subjects in lieu of geography or history in the Junior Examination, increasing the subjects' popularity.
Although closer settlement boosted agriculture, prickly pear cactus was a serious impediment for farmers in the Dalby district, until it was eradicated by the introduction of the moth "Cactoblastis cactorum" to Queensland in the late 1920s. As a result, Dalby experienced renewed growth and prosperity, and its population reached 3500 in the mid-1930s.
There was further expansion of agriculture in the Dalby District after World War II, due to the Soldier Settlement Scheme, which lead to an influx of young farmers. During the 1950s grain and wheat silos were constructed around the district, and a new flour mill was opened in Dalby. There was a related expansion of secondary industries, and an extensive home building program in the town. Dalby's population reached 4385 in 1947, and 6182 in 1954, with an acute housing shortage in town by 1955.
Dalby State School's enrolments grew in step with the town, and extra classrooms were added in the 1940s and early 1950s. The Department of Public Instruction was largely unprepared for the enormous demand for state education that began in the late 1940s and continued well into the 1960s. This was a nation-wide occurrence resulting from the unprecedented population growth now termed the "baby boom". Queensland schools were overcrowded and, to cope, many new buildings were constructed and existing buildings were extended. Enrolment at Dalby State School rose to 491 by 1945, and to 1024 by 1954. Leslie F Diplock, head teacher of Dalby State School from 1946, and Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Condamine from 1953, was instrumental in pushing for a new high school. In 1950 a member of the school's Parents and Citizen's association complained that the desks were so crowded that the children could not move their elbows to write.
A decision was made to provide a state high school for Dalby in July 1953, and building plans were prepared by the Department of Public Works (DPW) the following month. However, a site plan had previously been prepared in 1952. This early site plan showed entrance pathways leading from the Warrego Highway to the west end of the intermediate wing and from Nicholson Street to the east end of the domestic science block. From their introduction, the design of high school buildings was the responsibility of the DPW. The first high schools were established within existing technical colleges, utilising their buildings. The first purpose-built high school buildings were constructed in 1917.
In the 1950s the number of high schools in Queensland increased significantly. The grounds were large, greater than providing ample room for sports facilities. The general classroom buildings were the same standard types as used for primary schools but high schools also included purpose-built science laboratories, domestic science buildings, workshops for woodwork and metal work, libraries, and gymnasiums. These were also built to standard plans but were specific to their use and not a continuation of previous designs.
Also, there was a focus on the fit between the school and its neighbourhood, as well as site planning for expansion and ideal solar orientation. In the early 1950s, architects developed master planning concepts that influenced the design and layout of the whole school. Initially, these plans were broadly based on regular and symmetrical plan forms around a central or prominent axis. This concept was replaced a few years later by architects planning for growth and change. There was a shift away from grid-like layouts to organic layouts. Nuclear plans were designed, centred on an administration/reception building with classroom wings connected to and fanning away from the nucleus. The primary focus was the ideal solar orientation of buildings. Interest was also shown in developing schemes that related to the natural contours and existing vegetation. Unlike the more formal and symmetrical plans of previous periods, new plans were developed that tended to be asymmetrical and more open. The long, narrow buildings were positioned so that the spaces captured between them were triangular, opening out into the landscape.
At Dalby, the site chosen, northwest of Nicholson Street, was previously a Reserve for Park and Recreation, of which and were gazetted as a school reserve by 1955. The northeast half of the school site appears to have been gazetted for Hospital purposes in 1954, before being gazetted for school purposes in 1955.
The early development of the school reflects the 1950s shift in emphasis from grid-like layouts towards more organic planning strategies, which provided for "ordered growth from a nucleus". The initial school buildings consisted of four highset timber-framed buildings near the corner of Nicholson Street and the Warrego Highway - arranged in three parallel wings staggered one behind the other, aligned just east of north with verandahs along the north sides, and linked by an axis of highset covered walkways.
The southernmost wing (originally called Block A, but called Block D as at 2016) was for the intermediate school and administration, and this building consisted of (from the west) three classrooms and then two classrooms; with a library and reading room at the east end. The three middle classrooms were separated by folding doors. The administration section, attached off the north verandah, included a principal's room and an assistant teachers room.
The high school wing (Block B originally and in 2016) consisted of a small store room and assistant teachers room at the west end; a science room, a lecture room, and a classroom; then a hallway linking to the covered ways; and a commercial room at the east end of the wing - each of the main rooms being .
The vocational training wing (originally comprising Blocks C and D, now called Block A in 2016) consisted of two buildings: the eastern one was a domestic science block (originally Block C), with cooking and dressmaking classrooms in the centre, each ; with a teachers room and girls change room at the east end, and a dining room and laundry room at the west end of the block. The western building was the manual training block (originally Block D, of which only the east end survives in 2016), which had a sheet metalwork room and a woodwork room, each being , with a store and teachers room at the west end, and a store and wood machinery room at the east end of the block.
Plans of the semi-enclosed understories of the buildings included a health services room under the assistant teachers room in the administration section, and a drawing room under the east end of the intermediate wing. There was also a timber storeroom under the east end of the manual training block. All the buildings had horizontal boarded cladding and large banks of hopper windows facing south.
The high school wing and domestic science block were built in 1953–4, followed by the manual training block (completing the vocational training wing) and the intermediate wing in 1954–5.
There were differences in construction methods between the wings. The high school wing (Boulton &amp; Paul prefabricated timber school building) and the domestic science and manual training blocks (both Boulton &amp; Paul prefabricated timber vocational buildings) of the vocational training wing at Dalby were imported buildings. The Boulton &amp; Paul buildings were Type F/T1 and F/T3 respectively, the latter being a design for vocational buildings. Responding to materials shortages and the pressures of the baby boom, the DPW imported a British building system from manufacturers Boulton &amp; Paul Ltd of Norwich, England. Based on an planning and construction module, the prefabricated elements in the Boulton &amp; Paul system included wall panels, ceiling panels, roof trusses and banks of awning windows. The buildings were constructed at many schools across Queensland between 1951 and 1958. Boulton &amp; Paul buildings were timber framed and clad, had a verandah as circulation, and a gable roof. Ideally, they were oriented so the verandah faced north and the classroom faced south but were also added as extensions to existing buildings regardless of orientation. The stairs to the verandah were often semi-enclosed. The building could be low-set, or highset with a play space underneath, and had extensive areas of timber framed awning windows, providing more glazing than had ever been used in Queensland classrooms; almost the entirety of the verandah wall and the opposite classroom wall were glazed. Natural ventilation and lighting was abundant. The classrooms were , larger than most previous classrooms.
The intermediate wing was a highset timber school building with semi-enclosed stair. From the early 1950s the Department of Public Instruction introduced and developed new standard plans for school buildings, which were similar to the Boulton &amp; Paul buildings but not prefabricated. These buildings were also highset timber-framed structures with the understorey used as covered play space. The principal type was a long and narrow building with a gable roof. A semi-enclosed stair connected the understorey to a north facing verandah running the length of the building, with full height timber verandah posts that extended from ground level to the roof line. Classrooms opened off the verandah and had extensive areas of windows; almost the entirety of the verandah wall and the opposite classroom wall were glazed - with awning (top-hung) windows to the southern elevation, and double-hung sashes to the verandah wall. This type was the most commonly constructed in the 1950s in Queensland.
The new Dalby State High School opened 2 February 1954, with an enrolment of 67. At this time the floor was still being laid for the domestic science block, and electric lighting was not yet installed. In March it was reported that commercial classes had started at the state high school and that home science would probably transfer from the state school by Easter. In late 1954 it was reported that state high schools had opened at Dalby, Banyo, Salisbury, and Indooroopilly that year. The school was then officially opened on 4 September 1954 by the Minister for Education, George Devries, who noted that enrolments in state secondary schools had doubled from 5000 to 10,000 in the previous 5 years. He also stated that the buildings at Dalby were well ventilated, with a large amount of window space, and a generous floor area. At the time of the official opening the high school had an enrolment of 49 students in Form III and 21 in Form IV, and the manual training block had not yet been built. Grades 7 and 8 would transfer to the new school when the intermediate school building was completed.
Soon after the official opening a working bee was held on the school grounds. Seventy trees, including athel pines, silky oak, and other pines, plus Dalby myalls, and iron bark, were planted on the frontages to Nicholson Street and the Warrego Highway, and by December 1954 a playing field area had been mown, ploughed and harrowed, ready for rolling.
Grade 8 moved to the intermediate school at the new high school in 1956, followed by Grade 7 in 1957. The idea of creating an intermediate level of schooling emerged in Queensland during the late 1920s. This was intended to be a transition between primary and secondary schooling. Intermediate schools also offered vocational subjects: manual training for boys and domestic science for girls. By 1961 there were 654 intermediate and secondary students at Dalby State High School, which taught academic, commercial, industrial, home science and agricultural science courses. However, the intermediate section only operated from 1956 to 1963. Grade 8 became part of the high school in 1964; and in 1965 Grade 7 returned to the state school.
There were a number of changes and additions to the school in the late 1950s. In 1956-7 a highset timber school building with timber floor trusses (Block C in 2016) was added, at a slight angle, to the west end of the intermediate wing. Around this time the library/reading room space at the east end of the intermediate wing was converted into a teachers room and store.
Block C represented an evolution of the DPW's standard 1950s design, replacing the proliferation of stumps in the understorey with a timber truss that spanned the width of the classroom and provided an unimpeded play space. This type was also often fitted with clerestory windows above the verandah roof.  The building at Dalby was designed to have six classrooms, each , with a cloakroom between the fourth and fifth (from the east) classrooms, and a northern verandah. However, the two western classrooms and cloakroom of Block C were not built by mid-1957, and the westernmost classroom was not added until 1958, when two additional classrooms were also added under the west end of the block. In the semi-enclosed understory of Block C, drinking troughs were located along the southern wall, and a raised concrete platform was located at the east end.
An entrance link, with stairs up to the northern verandahs, filled the angle between the intermediate wing and Block C. This entrance was constructed in brick and had a skillion roof, and glazed double doors flanked by fixed glazing. The reinforced concrete slab floor extended outside to the south and was surrounded by boiler-plate flower boxes (not extant in 2016). Two brick flower boxes were also created to the rear (north) of the entrance link, and the western box survives in 2016. The original fan-shaped awning has since been replaced by a rectangular awning (post- January 2013).
Entry to the school has changed over time. A 1957 plan shows a pathway running directly from "Dalby-Kogan Road" (the Warrego Highway) to the link between Blocks D and C, which was labelled "proposed entrance". The caption read "Essential classroom accommodation has been provided here without the architectural emphasis to be derived from entrance and other features such as have been planned for this school." This plan also shows an entrance from Nicholson Street, east of the intermediate wing - about where the current pedestrian entrance is.
The pathway (not discernible in 2016) from the Warrego Highway to the entrance link is visible in a 1961 aerial photograph, as is a path (extant in 2016) from the intermediate wing to the corner of the Warrego Highway and Nicholson Street. The current metal arch at the corner, which reads "DALBY STATE HIGH SCHOOL", may date from this period, although the concrete base under the arch was added after 2007.
Other improvements at Dalby SHS in the 1950s included tennis courts, extant southwest of Block C by October 1958, and by this time there were also two toilet blocks north of the vocational training wing, and a school oval to the northeast.
The Queensland Government continued its focus on vocational education during the 1950s and 1960s. New standard types were developed including a brick veneer, concrete slab-on-ground and steel portal frame structure for manual training in 1958. A new manual training building (Block J in 2016) was built in late 1958–9, north of the west end of Block C, linked to the latter by a covered way. The brick veneer vocational building at Dalby contained a staffroom, switch room and store in a skillion roofed section at the north end, with two woodwork rooms and then two sheet metal rooms to the south (each ), and a passageway along the west side. The roof was a low gable with clerestory windows between the passage roof and the main roof. There were awning windows on the east side. The portal frames were to be of concrete or steel (the latter was used) and the wall cladding of face brick and metal. The school complex now formed a "U" shape, angled slightly inwards at the top (north).
A new administration building (Block F in 2016), also built in late 1958–9, was linked by a curved covered way to the lower level of the old administration section. Block F originally consisted of a library and passageway at the south end, a lobby, and then a principal's office and store. The building was brick veneer with a low gable roof of corrugated iron. There were paved areas either side of the building, and a cover was added over the paving at the front entrance c.1959. In the former administration section north of the intermediate wing, the assistant teachers room was expanded to absorb the old principal's office.
At the time of the construction of Block J and Block F, the DPW noted that as 'one of the first of the new High Schools, Dalby suffered from the demand for austerity inescapable at that time, but each succeeding addition effects marked improvement and the buildings are gaining aesthetically in the process. The most recent additions add the weight of bricks and mortar in such judicious degree that the "temporary" atmosphere of earlier years is being displaced by a new academic atmosphere of controlled vistas and scholastic dignity.' The new administration building also provided "a permanent entrance to the school".
Dalby State High School continued to require additions and extensions during the 1960s-70s. In late 1961 Australia's first commercial oilfield was discovered at Moonie, southwest of Dalby. Although a hoped-for refinery at Dalby never eventuated, the town received some economic benefits. As local dairy farming declined from the 1960s, beef cattle replaced cows, and Dalby also became the centre of Australia's largest reception, distribution and processing centre for grains. In 1963 Dalby had a population of 7500, with 2365 school pupils (at the state school, state high school, St Columba's Convent and the Christian Brothers College).
In 1960-1 a addition was made to the west end of the original manual training block (Block A in 2016), consisting of an agricultural science classroom and storeroom. A general purpose workroom, change room with shower, plus a store, were built immediately underneath. The remainder of the manual training block was converted to domestic science, with a kitchen and dressmaking room. The former wood machinery room at the east end became a dining room, and the former teachers room at the west end, adjacent to the new extension, became a rest/fitting room.
New toilet and shower blocks, connected to the original vocational training wing by a covered way, were added north of the school buildings , and a addition was made to the west end of Block B, then known as the "science wing". The extension included a physics demonstration room; physics store room, and physics laboratory.
By 1962 the room at the east end of the intermediate wing was a classroom, and Block J's rooms were labelled as (from south to north) two drawing rooms, then metalwork, then woodwork. In 1965 a tuckshop was built under the east end of the original domestic science block (Block A in 2016), and c.1968 a new science block was built east of the toilet blocks and Block A. By this time, Block E also existed north of Block A.
By 1971 a new amenities block had been added northeast of the toilet blocks and by this time the school appears to have had access to a recreation area north of the railway line. Although this land belonged to Napier Bros Limited from 1975, it remained as grass playing fields until c.2003.
In 1972 Block F was reconfigured, when the library was divided into a sick bay, deputy principal and principal's offices, and the former principal's office at the northeast end of the building was allocated to a clerk-typist. The walls of the former principal's office were pushed southwest into the lobby area, while the adjacent store room was altered and also extended southwest into the lobby area, with a small kitchenette formed at the northeast end of the storeroom. The same year a boys locker room was added to the understory of Block B, and a girls locker room was established in the ground floor of the entrance link between Block C and the former intermediate wing, and the flower beds under the entrance awning were removed at this time.
By 1975 there was a "great hall" near the western corner of the school, and a library north of E block; the 1961 toilet blocks had been replaced by extending of the 1971 amenities block, and there were demountable classrooms west of J block and basketball courts northeast of the 1968 science block. In late 1976 plans were drawn for a new locker room and two more classrooms (these were not extant in 2016, and may not have been built) to the understory of Block C, east of the existing two classrooms; while the entrance link between Block C and the former intermediate wing was converted into a storeroom, and a sports store and animal store were added under the 1950s section of Block B. By this time most of the western building of the original vocational training wing was no longer indicated on plans, presumably meaning it had been demolished.
The reason was a fire in April 1976, which had caused $100,000 in damage to the school, and a new building (constituting the western half of Block A in 2016) was constructed in 1977. This replaced all but the easternmost part of the original manual training block. The internal corridor leading from the covered way was moved west, into the remaining section of the manual training block, which was also used to form part of a new textile store and laundry room. At this time the original domestic science block was formed into two textile rooms, with a store and two fitting rooms between them, and the partitions for the small rooms at each end of the block were removed, along with the windows at the east end of the block.
Changes in room use also occurred from the late 1970s into the 1980s. In 1978 the old administration rooms north of the former intermediate wing were converted into boys and girl's health rooms, with obscure glass windows, while the former health services room downstairs became the guidance officer's room. In 1983 the science room at the west end of the original section of Block B was converted to a computer room, while the wall between the former store room and assistant teachers room was removed, creating an annexe to the west of the computer room. In the late 1980s Block J's southernmost two rooms were converted to Graphics rooms, with a woodwork room and a metalwork room to the north, and the staff room to the north became a store room.
By 2016 a number of other buildings had been added to the school, including a music block () northwest of Block C, and a new manual block northwest of Block J by 1990; a new home economics block west of Block E, with new tennis courts further west, and a new administration building northeast of Block F by 1998; and a small building north of Block E by 2004. In 2011 a trade training centre was added northwest of the hall, and by 2013 there was a new building northeast of the 1960s science block and the library had been extended. A Year 7 building was constructed west of the music block in 2014.  In 2016 Block J was renovated, with new interior linings, new windows to existing openings, and new doorways to the eastern side.
The size of the school was slightly reduced in 1996, when the western corner was excised into the road reserve to create a carpark, to the school's current . The Dalby Agricultural College, which opened in 1979 just northeast of the town, was acquired by Dalby State High School in 2011, becoming its "Bunya Campus" with a residential college and working farm. In 2016, Dalby SHS continues to operate from its original site on Nicholson Street. The school is important to the area as a focus for the community, and generations of students have been taught there.
Description.
Dalby State High School occupies a levelled site that is located approximately northwest of the Dalby CBD. The site is primarily accessed from Nicholson Street (southeast); and is bounded by the Warrego Highway (southwest), the Dalby-Glenmorgan railway line (northwest) and a light-industrial property (northeast). The school retains a complex of six 1950s buildings (and part of a seventh), located in the southeast corner of the site and linked by covered walkways, with a playing field to the northeast and perimeter shade trees.
The buildings within the school complex which are heritage-listed are:
Evidence of early site planning of the school grounds remains and is typical of Queensland schools during the 1950s, with the long, narrow, buildings linked by covered ways around open-ended courtyard play spaces. Highset, timber-framed Blocks A (north), B (centre) and D (south) have north-facing verandahs and are arranged in a staggered, parallel formation, orientated slightly east of north, linked by an axis of highset covered walkways. Adjacent, Block C is orientated slightly further east and is connected to the western end of Block D by a lowset entranceway. Blocks J and F are single storey brick-veneer buildings; Block J to the northwest is at a right angle to Block C, and Block F is next to the main entrance and faces Nicholson Street.
Boulton &amp; Paul prefabricated buildings (Blocks A &amp; B).
Blocks A and B are long, highset, prefabricated timber-framed buildings with gable roofs that continue over the north-facing verandahs. A first floor covered walkway connects Block A with Block B to the south. Both blocks have later extensions to the west (Block A, 1977; and Block B, 1962), which are not the Boulton &amp; Paul type and are not of state cultural heritage significance.
The building exteriors are clad in timber chamferboards, including the southern and eastern sides of the understoreys, with the Boulton &amp; Paul sections clearly distinguishable from later sections by vertical timber strips that define each panel of the prefabricated wall units on the first floor. The eastern end of Block B is clad in modern corrugated metal.
Large areas of timber awning windows, with fanlights, line the southern Boulton &amp; Paul walls, with brackets attached to the mullions and supporting the overhanging eaves. The verandahs have timber floors, continuous timber posts, flat-sheeted raked ceilings and enclosed balustrades, which are either clad in chamferboards (Block A) or profiled metal-clad bag racks (Block B).
The Block A-B walkway aligns with the similar Block B-D walkway to the south. The highset covered walkways have continuous timber posts, railed balustrades, timber floors and flat roofs with flat-sheeted ceilings.
The understoreys have concrete floors, and combine open play space with enclosed areas for various uses. The floor structure of the classrooms above is exposed, with timber bearers supported on concrete piers. Windows on the eastern and southern sides are a combination of louvred (Block A) and latticed (Blocks A &amp; B).
Block A.
Block A includes one Boulton &amp; Paul building to the east, and part of another Boulton &amp; Paul building to the west, and retains its original chamferboard-clad northeast corner verandah balustrade, and bulkheads approximately halfway along the verandah indicate the location of the former domestic science laundry. The verandah is accessed by modern metal-framed stairs, and is enclosed with lattice and metal mesh above the balustrade. Windows along the verandah wall have been replaced with modern aluminium-framed sliding sashes, with fanlights. Classrooms have half-glazed, boarded doors.
The first floor contains two classrooms to the east of the covered way, and two offices to the west, which have a hallway containing steps up to the adjacent extension. The passageway connecting the covered way with the verandah has been relocated to the west, into the remaining section of the second Boulton &amp; Paul building (former manual training), around modern store rooms. An opening formed in the partition between the classrooms has a modern concertina door. The classroom walls are flat-sheeted, with rounded cover strips, and the ceilings have been relined lined with plasterboard.
The understorey contains a tuckshop (1965-77), office and store rooms. The walls are clad in a combination of timber chamferboards, V-jointed (VJ) tongue-and-groove (T&amp;G) boards, timber battens and flat sheeting, and the interiors are lined with flat sheeting, some areas with rounded cover strips. 
Block B.
Block B has timber stairs positioned at either end of the verandah, with the understoreys of the stairs clad in chamferboards. The stairs have railed timber balustrades, which are also retained on adjacent sections of the verandah. The verandah walls have double-hung sash windows, with awning fanlights, and modern flush-finish doors.
The first floor contains three classrooms and two store rooms to the west of the covered way, and a staff room to the east. Classroom interiors have flat-sheeted walls, with rounded cover strips, and modern suspended ceilings.
The understorey contains a classroom and student café, separated by a store room. The enclosures are clad and lined with flat sheeting, with cover strips to the interiors.
Later extensions.
The later western extensions are similar in form to the original buildings, but are not of state cultural heritage significance.
The Block A (1977) extension is set slightly higher, and has a wider verandah. The understorey is enclosed with face brick; a narrow passageway separates it from the 1950s section.
The Block B (1962) extension has a flat-sheeted verandah wall with vertical louvres over fixed glazing. The understorey is partly open.
Highset timber school building (Block D).
Block D is a long, highset, gable-roofed building with semi-enclosed stairs at either end of the north-facing verandah. The exterior is clad in chamferboards, including the stairs and the eastern, southern and western sides of the understorey. An original gable-roofed projection to the north is at a right angle to the main building and connects with the covered walkway to Block B. An adjacent ground floor covered walkway connects with Block F to the east.
The southern wall has large areas of timber awning windows and the verandah wall has double-hung timber sashes, both with fanlights. The verandah has full height (continuous) timber posts, timber floors, raked ceilings and enclosed bag rack balustrades, which are clad in profiled metal. Classroom doors are half-glazed and boarded.
The first floor contains five classrooms and a staff room, with the three central classrooms divided by original timber-panelled folding partitions. The interiors are lined with flat sheeting, with rounded cover strips above dado height and on the ceilings. The northern projection has double-hung timber sash windows, and contains adjoining office and store rooms.
The understorey combines open play space and enclosed areas for a staff lounge (western end) and store room (northern projection). The floor structure of the classrooms above is exposed, with the timber bearers supported on concrete piers. The understorey floor is concrete.
A lowset, skillion-roofed uniform shop (former entranceway, 1956) connects the western end of Block D with Block C. The walls are brick, with fixed glazing and battened sheeting flanking a modern flush-finish door. A concrete slab with faceted corners projects south of the entranceway, and has a rectangular modern skillion-roofed awning over. An enclosed cantilevered walkway along the northern side connects the first floor verandahs of the two adjoining buildings; it is clad in corrugated metal and has high-level fixed windows. The interior is flat-sheeted and the ground floor has a modern suspended ceiling.
Timber school building (Block C).
Block C is a long, gable-roofed building supported on open timber floor trusses. Built in stages, it comprises: four highset classrooms and a cloakroom (1956) at the eastern end; a single highset classroom to the immediate west (1957); and a single first floor classroom and two ground floor classrooms at the western end (1958).
The exterior is clad in weatherboards, including the eastern and southern sides of the understorey. The southern wall has large banks of awning windows along the first floor, and the ground floor classrooms. High-level window openings on the southern side of the eastern understorey are lined with lattice. The two-storey end wall and piers supporting the 1958 extension's verandah are face brick. The gable roof of the 1958 extension continues over its verandah, while the earlier verandah has a lower, flatter roof, supported on continuous metal posts and set below clerestory lights on the verandah wall.
The verandah is accessed via metal-framed stairs, and has timber floors and bag rack balustrades that are clad externally with profiled metal. Classroom doors are half-glazed, and double-hung sash windows, with fanlights, line the chamferboard-clad verandah and northern understorey walls. The western classrooms are distinguishable from the earlier classrooms by their narrower verandah chamferboards.
The classrooms are separated by fixed partitions, with 2-light panelled timber doors at the southern end. The interior walls and ceilings are flat-sheeted, with rounded cover strips (above dado height on the first floor). Classrooms retain cupboards under sloping whiteboards.
The understorey features exposed timber floor trusses, visible in both the classrooms and the open play space at the eastern end. Block C is connected to Block J to the north by a ground-floor covered walkway.
Brick veneer vocational building (Block J).
Block J is a long, single storey, brick veneer building with an open web steel portal frame. The building retains its four classrooms, with a passageway along the western side that aligns with the covered way connecting with Block C. A lowset former storage/office wing surrounds the northwest corner.
The low-pitched gable roof of the wing and the skillion roof of the passage are set lower than the gable-roofed core, with clerestory lights between. The roofs are clad in corrugated metal. The eastern and western sides of the building are clad in profiled metal below sill height. Windows on the eastern side of the classrooms comprise modern aluminium-framed sliding sashes, with a continuous fanlight, shaded by an exterior high-level louvred metal awning. New doors have been added to the eastern side of the classrooms. Windows on the western side of the passageway, the clerestory and the wing have been removed (at the time of inspection in mid-2016) for replacement.
The interior has been altered, with the removal of some walls, and the addition of some new partitions. The classrooms have modern suspended ceilings and walls sheeted in plasterboard, concealing and enclosing the open web steel portal frame. The fabric added in 2016 is not of cultural heritage significance.
Administration building (Block F).
Block F is a long, single storey, brick veneer building with a low-pitched gable roof. In 2016 it is used as a student services building and comprises: a central entrance lobby and waiting area; two large and one small offices / meeting rooms to the southwest (former open-plan library), with a passageway along the northwest side; and two small office / meeting rooms (former Principal's Office), and a store room and kitchenette (part of former waiting room and an original store room), to the northeast.
The main entrance from Nicholson Street is indicated by a flat-roofed metal-framed canopy and a stencilled, poly-chrome painted concrete slab; it has stained timber-framed wired-glass doors, with sidelights. A ground floor covered walkway connects the western side of the lobby with Block D to the west.
The southwest section has banks of timber-framed awning windows on the southeast side (with fanlights) and along the passageway (clad above externally in profiled metal). Some of the timber-framed awning windows on the northeast wall have been replaced with metal-framed sliding windows.
The interior walls and ceilings are predominantly flat-sheeted, with rounded cover strips. The lobby interior combines flat-sheeted and face brick walls. The wall between the two large southwest offices (1972) is clad in stained timber-veneer. The doors are a combination of painted, stained timber-veneer and half-glazed.
Landscape elements.
The school grounds are well established, with sporting facilities including a generously sized playing field/sports oval at the eastern end of the site, with perimeter shade trees.
The school buildings are set back from the Warrego Highway, with an open lawn between. A row of mature trees line the Warrego Highway boundary, the oldest being closest to the corner, and a mature bottle tree ("Brachychiton rupestris") is situated adjacent to Nicholson Street. An mature tree is also located north of the west end of Block A's 1970s extension.
The entrance to Block F retains an area of stencilled, poly-chrome painted concrete slab. The main entrance from Nicholson Street, northeast of Block F, is landscaped with modern pavers and garden beds that contain a range of shrubs.
A decorative metal archway (possibly pre-1961), set on modern concrete plinths, frames a pedestrian entrance from the corner of the Warrego Highway and Nicholson Street, featuring "DALBY STATE HIGH SCHOOL" in metal lettering.
The splayed open courtyard spaces between the 1950s buildings, which were formed as part of the 1950s planning, are sealed in bitumen, with large areas finished with modern synthetic turf and sheltered by modern open shade structures. 
Heritage listing.
Dalby State High School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 19 August 2016 having satisfied the following criteria.
The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.
Dalby State High School (established in 1954) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains excellent, representative examples of standard government designs that were architectural responses to prevailing government educational philosophies; set in landscaped grounds with sporting facilities.
It is also important for demonstrating the pattern of provision of secondary education across Queensland in the 1950s, as it incorporates all the features associated with secondary education - a high school, an intermediate school and vocational training facilities.
The layout of the administration and classroom buildings, the covered links between them and associated open spaces, reflect the early 1950s introduction of master planning, and the subsequent shift from grid-like layouts around a central axis towards more organic planning strategies, which provided for ordered growth from a nucleus.
The Boulton &amp; Paul Buildings (1953-5) demonstrate the introduction and adoption of imported prefabricated systems by the Queensland Government in response to acute building material shortages and population growth in the post-World War II period. The former domestic science block also reflects the Queensland Government's focus on vocational training as a way of ensuring the state's economic prosperity.
The highset timber school building with semi-enclosed stair (1954-5) and Timber school building with timber floor trusses (1956-8) represent the evolution of Department of Public Works designs during the mid to late 1950s, based on features of the Boulton &amp; Paul buildings.
The former administration building and brick veneer vocational building (both 1958–9) represent a move away from the austerity of the early 1950s to a more permanent aesthetic, incorporating masonry elements. The former administration building, with its entry canopy and poly-chrome painted concrete paving, provided a formal entrance to the school.
The brick veneer vocational building also represents the Queensland Government's ongoing emphasis on vocational training.
The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.
Dalby State High School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland state high school of the 1950s. These include its 1950s site planning; range of highset or lowset timber-framed and brick veneer buildings of standard and individual designs; and a generous, landscaped site with shade trees, and assembly and sports areas.
Following 1950s site planning principles, the school includes six 1950s buildings (and part of a seventh) that all contribute to the general concept of long, narrow buildings linked around open ended courtyard assembly and play spaces. The four earliest buildings are arranged in a staggered parallel formation of three wings, linked by an axis of covered walkways, while the three later buildings are arranged and linked in a more organic manner.
The former administration building; the former entrance link between the buildings addressing the Warrego Highway; and the covered links between the buildings, are characteristic of 1950s school design in Queensland, providing a ground level administration facility connected to the school by a covered walkway, with other walkways linking the classroom blocks.
The highset timber teaching buildings are all good, intact examples of their type and retain their: highset character with some covered play space under; timber-framed, lightweight construction; gable roofs; north-facing verandahs for circulation; large banks of south-facing timber-framed awning windows, with fanlights; and wide classrooms.
The Boulton &amp; Paul Buildings also clearly demonstrate the characteristics of prefabricated buildings through the expression of their modular construction in the external cladding.
The connected highset timber school building with semi-enclosed stair and the Timber school building with timber floor trusses demonstrate two iterations of the Department of Public Work's standard designs: the first on concrete piers; and the second incorporating timber floor trusses for unimpeded play space.

Jack Callahan (Neighbours)

Jack Callahan is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera "Neighbours", played by Andrew Morley. The actor was cast in late 2015 and landed the regular role of Jack. Morley had previously played Spencer Harrington in fellow soap opera "Home and Away" for two years. He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 4 April 2016. The character departed on 30 March 2018, but Morley later reprised the role and returned on 26 February 2020, as part of the show's 35th anniversary celebrations.
When Jack first arrives, he is involved in the explosion at Lassiters hotel and left unable to recall his identity. Morley described the character as one with a "clean slate" due to his amnesia and lack of family ties or connections to Erinsborough. Two months after his arrival, his name and identity as a Catholic priest was revealed. His storylines have subsequently focused on the conflict of his religious vocation and relationship with Paige Smith (Olympia Valance).
His storylines have also focused on his rivalry with Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) despite Morley stating that Jack has a lot of respect for him and feels that he is a good role model for his son. The character made a tough decision over leaving the priesthood and viewers have expressed negative feelings towards his relationship with Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner) with one calling their relationship "disgusting" and another seeing the coupling as "random".
With Paige unsure about whether to tell Jack about the paternity of her baby, Katie Baillie from Metro UK showed her compassion for Jack but later felt that he didn't act like an adult when he gets into a fight with Mark.
Casting.
On 31 January 2016, Holly Byrnes from "The Daily Telegraph" announced the former "Home and Away" star Andrew Morley's casting on "Neighbours" as John Doe. Morley was asked to film an audition tape after he had received an email from his manager whilst in Cambodia helping raise money and awareness towards human trafficking. Morley began filming in December 2015. Morley commented on working with Paige Smith actress Olympia Valance describing her as "extremely friendly" and of a "great energy". Valance reminded Morley of Demi Harman, who he worked with early on on "Home And Away."
When Morley first got the role, he was not briefed on what his characters true identity was and where the character was going. He also said that his characters alias 'John Doe' was still written on his scripts at times he was filming scenes under the name Jack. He later added that he now knows what direction his character is going in and said "it'll be a big story arc". He also said that the audience will be taken through "a really interesting journey of trying to work out who he is" in finding out what his character is doing in Erinsborough, what significance his character is going to have and who his character will be involved with. Morley added that his character has a "clean slate" as he has no connections to anyone in Erinsborough.
Development.
Introduction and characterisation.
Jack arrives in Erinsborough with no family ties and a 'mysterious past' of which Paige helps him discover. Morley said that "Paige helps him to discover who he is", together they work out why he is in Erinsborough. Morley said, "It's been fun piecing together the puzzle." After he is involved in a fire at the Lassiter's complex in his first scenes, he suffers amnesia. Determined to find out his past, Paige becomes curious in Jack and decides to visit him in hospital, later becoming fascinated by him. With his details unknown, he is given the name John Doe. When talking about John's future identity, Morley described it as "completely off the scales". He also guaranteed that nobody would pick what his character turns out to be. Morley said "It's a good little journey and the audience is going to love it."
He later remembers that he is a Catholic Priest and goes to the police station to inform them of his past and his true identity is confirmed as Father Jack Callahan. Jack is described to be a "man of God" and to have "devoted his life to religion and helping people", with being a "genuine, kind, sincere and loving person". His reasonings for being in Erinsborough were also revealed, with Jack only passing through and staying at a friends house. He was at Lassiter's on the day of the blast off to help someone who had talked to him during confession.
Relationship with Paige Smith.
After the explosion at Lassiter's, Paige visits John Doe in hospital, hoping to find out about his past. Mandy Franze (Kristy Best) turns up and claims she knows John and is the love of his life. After Mandy kisses John, Paige is forced to accept that she has lost him for good. Paige falls for John and the feeling is mutual, with Morley describing it as "true love for both of them" and that "Jack has never felt like this about anybody." However, with John revealed as Jack Callahan, a Catholic priest, Morley also explains that it will be a dilemma for Jack on deciding who he will devote his life to. Paige meets Dustin Oliver (Kevin Clayette), a person from Jack's past, and kisses him, much to Jack's dismay. After Jack dreams of a kiss with Paige, he goes to Father Guidotti (John Orcsik), the local priest for advice. He later prays and asks God for a sign.
After Father Guidotti dies, Jack sees this as the sign he asked for from God, with Jack feeling his death was down to God allowing him to continue his work in Erinsborough. With Paige feeling upset about Jack's decision, she confesses to her mother, Lauren Carpenter (Kate Kendall), that she is unable to think straight around him, vowing to keep her distance. However, after she realises Jack shares the same feelings as her, she decides to boycott the plan and spend as much time around him as possible. Paige later goes to confession and tells Jack of her recent hookups, to show that she has moved on from him. Daniel Killelly from "Digital Spy" commented on Paige's visit to confession saying, "Jack Callahan is probably used to awkward confessional visits every now and again, but this one really takes the biscuit".
After Paige dresses up as a nun, Jack feels like she is making a mockery of what he believes in. This leaves them no longer on speaking terms, but after Paige goes on a hot air balloon trip that ends up crashing, Jack comes to find Paige and the pair sleep together. However, an old friend of Jack's, Simone Bader (Kahli Williams), turns up in Erinsborough and after finding out Jack had slept with Paige, she questions if she is worth leaving the priesthood over.
Paige finds out she is pregnant with Jack's baby, but decides against telling him. When Jack comes to Paige's rescue after she is involved in a car accident, she reveals to Jack that the baby is his. Paige considers leaving Erinsborough to move to Queensland along with her parents, taking the baby away and leaving Jack behind, but ultimately decides to stay. Paige goes back to where the baby is conceived and goes into labour and gives birth to a son, Gabriel Smith (Kian Bafekrpour). Jack along with Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) come to Paige's rescue and takes her and the baby to hospital.
The pair later reunite and sleep together, betraying both their partners. Morley commented in an interview with Radio Times, "At that moment and with Gabe in front of them, everything felt so right and they went for it. That gave Jack hope but afterwards Paige wants to bury it and forget it happened. This hurts Jack who wants to tell Steph, even though he knows she'd be upset, but Paige is not of the same mindset and regrets it." He added, "Most of the feedback suggests fans want Jack and Paige to be together. It was hard playing the Steph and Jack relationship because it didn’t have the substance he had with Paige, so naturally the audience isn't going to believe in it as much. I loved working with Carla Bonner (Steph Scully) as we get on great and hang out a lot. But the audience will want Jack with Paige, though Paige is committed to Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) who is a great guy and a lovable character... Fans will be torn as no one is the villain here, and everyone ends up getting hurt in some way."
Relationship with Stephanie Scully.
After Steph helps Jack look after his son, Gabe, they develop feelings for one another and have sex. However Paige later bans Steph from being around Gabe due to her past mental health issues. This causes Steph to end her relationship with Jack, feeling that he needs to focus on his family and believing that things wouldn't have worked out with Jack in the long run anyway. Continuing their relationship however, Jack realises he is not Steph's priority when 'having a relationship' didn't feature on a list of what she wants to do in her life.
After Steph returns from a Christmas break with her mother, Steph expects to see Jack waiting for her when she returns, however instead he is with Paige. When he eventually sees Steph, he cancels his lunch with her to spend time with Gabe and Paige, but Steph insists she comes along too. She later becomes irritated as Jack's attention is focused on Gabe during the outing. However, Steph talks to her friend Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) about her concerns, feeling the age difference between herself and Jack may be too big. Toadie later gives Jack advice on how he can keep Steph happy in their relationship.
On 25 January 2018, Sasha Morris from "The Daily Star" questioned if this was the beginning of a love triangle between the couple and Paige. On 5 February 2018, Daniel Kilkelly from "Digital Spy" reported that Jack and Paige would have a one-night stand. Kilkelly also reported that Steph would seek revenge when she finds out about the affair with her ransacking Jack's room at the backpackers in a fit of anger but later confesses to the police of her actions. This brings repercussions for Steph as her planned trip for visiting her son in Fiji is ruined as her overseas visa is revoked due to the criminal charges for the damage.
Rivalry with Mark Brennan.
On 13 November 2017, it was reported by Kilkelly ("Digital Spy") that Jack would "drive" Paige and Mark's relationship apart when he discovers that the pair are arguing. Jack challenges Mark about his behaviour, but without an explanation Mark is forced to steer clear from Paige and his baby.
Later, in December 2017, "Digital Spy" reported that Jack would get into a "violent" fight with Mark in the new 2018 season. After Gabe is kidnapped, with Paige dating Mark, he becomes involved and tensions rise between the pair. With Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta) and Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond) determined to get Jack and Mark on better terms, they decide to get them together with a game of Croquet. But a feud starts to arise and meets its climax when the pair have a "full-blown brawl" in public. Sophie Dainty from "Digital Spy" described the scenes as "explosive". During the fight, Jack's anger causes him to tell Mark how he really feels and blames Mark for his son's recent abduction.
After Paige discusses the "awkwardness", "occasional violence" and how Jack feels threatened by Mark as he feels he is "muscling in on his family", Paige goes to see Jack. When Paige turns up, old feelings arise from their previous relationship and Jack ends up sleeping with Paige. When asked in an interview with "Radio Times" about how Jack feels about Mark — Morley replied, "Jack has a lot of respect for him, he's nice guy and a great role model for Gabe. However he wasn't thinking of Mark's feelings when he slept with Paige, although Jack is upset that he's hurt the guy. Paige truly wants to settle down with Mark, but she knows what she did with Jack and her mind is in two places at once..." On 17 February 2018, Kilkelly ("Digital Spy") reported that tensions may be flaring up again when Mark's temper puts Gabe in danger whilst with Paige and Jack.
Departure and return.
On 19 March 2018, it was confirmed that Morley would be leaving "Neighbours" alongside Valance. After seeing how much Mark is struggling with their relationship, Paige and Jack decide to leave Erinsborough for a fresh start in Queensland with their son.
On 24 November 2019, "Neighbours" confirmed that Morley would reprise the role for the serial's 35th anniversary celebrations. Jack returns alongside Paige on 26 February 2020.
Storylines.
Shortly after arriving at the Lassiter's Complex, John bumps into Paige Smith. They run into each other again outside the hotel, just as the boiler room explodes. John throws himself on top of Paige to protect her. He is taken to the hospital, where he remains in a coma. One of the nurses tells Paige that they do not know who he is, as he had no identification on him. Paige stays by his bedside and is present when he wakes up. John suffers from amnesia and cannot remember his own name. Paige gets him a job with Amy Williams's handywoman business. Amy also offers him a place to live. John meets with a hotel employee, who spoke to him on the day of the explosion, but she cannot help him find out who he is. Paige puts up flyers, asking if anyone can identify John. A hotel guest named Steven Aniston (Garikai Jani) recalls John saying he has links with Geelong. John and Paige travel to the city and stay in a local hostel. Just as Paige and John are about to kiss, Paige spots a photograph of John with another man, who they later learn is Dustin Oliver (Kevin Clayette). They arrange to meet Dustin in Erinsborough. He greets John as "Jay", before he runs away when he spots Mark Brennan in his police uniform. John decides to leave town, but Paige persuades him to stay. John has two hypnosis sessions with Karl Kennedy, who later refers him to a psychiatrist.
Mandy Franze claims to be John's girlfriend, but they soon find out she is lying. Paige tries to kiss John, but he rejects her and Paige asks him to leave. John sees a woman driving a van and says he remembers her and the company, which he later learns repairs boilers. John suffers flashbacks of the Lassiter's boiler room and believes that he may have caused the explosion. He then goes to the police to confess, but the detective tells him that he did not cause the explosion. John kisses Paige. The witness who saw him on the morning of the explosion later reveals she was paid to lie. John's memory returns and he is able to tell Mark that Julie Quill (Gail Easdale) and Jacka Hills (Brad McMurray) caused the explosion. Paige comes to the station and John emerges in clerical clothing. He reveals his name is Jack Callahan and that he is a priest. He explains that he was questioning his faith when he came to Erinsborough and was staying with a priest in Elliot Park, but when he went away to Rome, Jack was left to counsel Julie at the church. He followed her to Lassiter's and saw her in the boiler room, but did not expect her to cause an explosion. Jack briefly leaves Erinsborough to see his family and Paige says she will wait for him. Jack faces conflicting pressures between his love for Paige and his vow of celibacy. Jack looks after a little girl named Poppy Jarvis, who has cystic fibrosis, whilst her mother is in hospital, and he organises an fancy dress party for her. Ari Philcox reveals in the confessional that he's been releasing the snakes. Jack's priestly vows forbid him passing on this information. Jack thinks that Paige is the intended target, but later learns that Steph is.
Jack receives an audio message from Paige's sister, Piper Willis (Mavournee Hazel) of Paige declaring her love to him while on a hot air balloon trip, but during the voice message, Jack learns that Paige and her family are in danger and drives to the crash site. Jack sees everyone except for Paige, and Piper tells him that Paige jumped off the balloon before it crashed. Jack goes to find her and finds her red scarf in a dam. After searching, he finds an unconscious Paige on the shore, who suffers from hypothermia. He carries her to an abandoned shack to warm her up. Jack told Paige that he knows how sorry she is and confess his love to Paige. The pair then sleep together, reconciling their relationship. They are soon found by Paige's father, Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin). Jack leaves for Queensland, later returning with his former girlfriend, Simone Bader, causing Paige to again feel betrayed. Jack and Paige break up as he chooses the church over her again. Jack becomes jealous over Paige's friendship with David Tanaka (Takaya Honda). Jack finds out that Paige is pregnant and Jack assumes he's the father, but Paige says that he's not and that David is the father. Jack wants Dustin Oliver to help with a new refugee centre, but Dustin refuses thinking, wrongly, that he may be the father of Paige's baby, and wants to get away. When Jack learns that he is the father of Paige's baby, he considers leaving the priesthood and remaining in Erinsborough with Paige, whose parents are leaving for the Gold Coast. Paige considers leaving with them, but decides to stay, so Jack can be with his child. Paige returns to the shack where their child was conceived and goes into labour. Jack and Karl find her and help deliver her son. Paige loses consciousness and is rushed to the hospital, while the baby is taken to a neonatal unit. Jack decides to leave the church. Lauren returns to support Paige, and is initially angry with Jack for letting Paige go off on her own. Paige eventually regains consciousness and names their son Gabriel. After learning Paige's sister is ill, Jack encourages Paige to go to Queensland with Lauren to support her. Having decided to give up his position within the church, Jack calls Bishop Green (Mirko Grillini). Bishop Green tells Jack that if he quits the priesthood the church will close. He decides to go through with his plan and leaves the church. He moves into Erinsborough Backpackers. Jack declares his feelings for Paige, but she rejects him. Jack works with Stephanie Scully on an application for the Most Liveable Suburb competition and they kiss. Steph initially calls it a mistake, but they later have sex and soon begin a relationship. Jack supports Steph when she thinks she is having a mental health relapse, and when she turns her motel into a cancer wellness centre. Jack secures a job at Erinsborough High as a counsellor, but some students accuse him of promoting religion, though he is later vindicated.
When Gabe is kidnapped by Louise McLeod (Maria Theodorakis), Jack blames Mark for his family's involvement in the dodgy dealings of Hamish Roche (Sean Taylor), the father of Mark's brother Tyler (Travis Burns). He also calls the police when Mark attempts to negotiate with Louise despite Mark advising him not to, delaying the search. Although Gabe is later found and returned by Cassius Grady (Joe Davidson), Jack is still steamed with Mark, resulting in a brawl with him during a day out. Jack and Paige later have a one-night stand, which Steph and Mark discover after the four take a glamping trip. They break up with their respective partners, and after realising the damage their actions have caused, Jack, Paige and Gabe move to Queensland to be closer to Paige's parents.
Two years later, Paige returns to Erinsborough and informs her former stepmother Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou) that she believes Jack is having an affair. Jack also returns and reveals that he was talking to Mark Gottlieb (Bruce Samazan) about rejoining the priesthood. They later decide to break up and Jack returns to Queensland. He later returns with Gabe after Paige announces that she is marrying Mark. The following day, he presides over Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh) and Lana Crawford's (Bridget Neval) wedding. Upon discovering that there is a vacancy at a parish church in Adelaide, where Mark is living, he offers to move there so Paige and Gabe can do so as well.
Reception.
Near to his first appearance while his identity remained unknown, sources weren't sure what to make of John, with Kilkelly ("Digital Spy") describing him as "mysterious" and Sam Warner ("Digital Spy") commenting, "it's unclear if he is a hero or villain". Dainty ("Digital Spy") felt that the character of Jack caused big changes to Paige's life, describing him as "the priest who turned Paige Smith's life upside down".
Katie Baillie from the "Metro" called Jack a "poor lad" after Paige doesn't tell him about the baby. She later showed him compassion when Paige told him her baby was his, commenting, "In fairness, it is pretty bad news for the guy, given that he's in the priesthood and shouldn't be making babies. But hearing it from Paige as she thinks she's about to die and learning other people knew this whole time isn't ideal for him either." However, she later lets on that Jack may have a bit of a childish side after getting into a fight with Mark over Paige, commenting, "Jack can't act like an adult about it all." Fans disliked the pairing of Jack and Steph, labelling the paring "disgusting", "dumb" and "random". When Steph fails to priortise her relationship with Jack, fans expressed their disapproval of the relationship again, commenting, "I don't like Jack and Steph at all. Time to split!"

Long as I Live (Toni Braxton song)

"Long as I Live" is a song by American singer Toni Braxton from her eighth studio album "Sex &amp; Cigarettes" (2018). Written by Braxton, Paul Boutin, and Antonio Dixon, whom also produced the track, it is a "soulful '90s-style" R&amp;B and soul track that finds the singer struggling with breaking up and moving on from her past lover. The song was released on February 9, 2018 by Def Jam Recordings as the second single from the album, with an accompanying music video premiered on March 23, 2018 to coincide with the parent album's release.
Upon its release, "Long as I Live" received positive reviews from music critics for its "nostalgic" feel, with Braxton's voice described "as strong as ever". The song won the 50th NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Song, Traditional, and also earned Braxton nominations for Best R&amp;B Performance and Best R&amp;B Song at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, the former being her fifth overall and first nomination in eighteen years since "He Wasn't Man Enough".
The song also attained commercial success for the singer in the States, becoming her eight chart-topper for five consecutive weeks on the US "Billboard" Adult R&amp;B Songs, thus becoming the artist with the second most number one titles on the chart. It was also her first top fifteen entry on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart in nearly eighteen years since "Just Be a Man About It", and her first single to enter the component UK Singles Downloads Chart, peaking at number fifty-four. Braxton has since appeared on several daytime shows to promote the song, and eventually embarked on the eponymous As Long as I Live Tour to further perform the song and its parental album throughout 2019.

Women in Law &amp; Development in Africa

Women in Law &amp; Development in Africa (WiLDAF) is a Pan-African women's rights organization and network which is non-profit and non-government (NGO) and contains 500 organizations, 1200 individuals and spreads over 27 countries. Even though WiLDAF functions as a multi-regional/transnational organization, it pays close attention to the economical, social and historical differences between states and countries.
This organization grew out of the "women's rights as human rights" movement, as a more assertive claim to rights for women than the previous rhetoric of "needs".
WiLDAF centers around the principle that equality and empowerment are essential to a healthy society, and they focus their efforts on development and the law in relation to women to advocate for and educate people. They believe that empowering women through education, workshops, communication and outreach around development and law is extremely valuable. In addition, they work at national and regional levels to spur institutional planning, development and building international connections for added support. The organization also provides aid in the case of a violation of women's rights by providing Emergency Response Systems and facilitating centers for women who have been abused psychologically, physically or morally (and in such cases can shelter the woman and help her to take legal action)
History.
Women in Law &amp; Development in Africa was established in February 1990 during a regional conference in Harare, Zimbabwe (with the theme of "Women, right and development: network for empowerment in Africa") as a result of 6 women coming together with the idea for a pan-African organization after attending the World Women's Conference held in Nairobi, 1985. This forum was also instrumental in the creation of WiLDAF because issues around women's rights became the topic of debate for the many African women participating in the forum.
The World Women's Conference was where the ideas around "women's rights as human rights" became a topic of debate.
Another notable point in the origin of WiLDAF was where humanitarian organizations lobbied for the formal recognition of woman's rights during the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna 1993.
An additional conference that furthered the "women's rights as human rights" movement was the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995, where this movement was further defined. As well as providing a topic of debate around women's rights as human rights, the conference also spurred debate about empowerment through law.
The three aforementioned meetings were sponsored by the "Women in Law and Development" project by a US donor agency called OEF International.
OEF International facilitated the growth of regional networks of organizations to combine their efforts and work at local levels to spread education and information around women's rights issues. In addition to WiLDAF, OEF International supported the formation of Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD) as well as the Comité de América Latina y El Caribe para la Defensa de los Derechos de la Mujer (CLADEM) in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Structure.
WiLDAF's head office is located in Harare, Zimbabwe. As a transnational organization, WiLDAF contains national offices as well as local offices in specific regions; in certain regions local WiLDAF Advisory Committees and representatives function instead of local offices where there are none. WiLDAF's meetings, agendas and decision-making are built on a "from the ground-up" philosophy around structure which begins at the local level and continues through to larger and larger structures including country, regional and international. Member individuals and organizations are involved at many steps of decision-making and meetings. Surveys and reports are often part of meetings (see below "Surveys").
WiLDAF hold their General Assembly every few years to plan and prioritize for the future, reaffirm and add to their objectives as well as celebrate accomplishments.
Aims and goals.
WiLDAF grew out of the movement called "women's rights as human rights", which emphasizes that rights can be lobbied for, enforced and monitored as opposed to the language of "needs". It also moves away from manifestos and demands present in earlier feminist discourse. Furthermore, Human rights does not take the standard as the rights of "men", therefore organizations can better address the reproductive, maternity, gender-based discrimination and domestic violence needs that women require. This movement advocated for women's rights in all spheres, including promoting private affairs to be under lawful scrutiny (such as domestic violence) in regions which traditionally separate the private and public domains and as a result call to reform "family law". A distinction between the "private" and the "public" is made here as "private" laws tend to affect women in particular due to the fact that women tend to be relegated there by societal expectations. The private is also traditionally (whether culturally, regionally or religiously) the place where the state does not extend, and therefore provides multi-layered hurdles for advocacy actions. "Women's rights as human rights" is a movement to claim the rights women have and to empower women through education and an interconnectivity of local and global spheres. 
An aspect of the "woman's rights as human rights" movement that remains in the aims of WiLDAF is an inter-connectivity between both local and global efforts to empower women through law and development as discussed below. Communication between all facets of WiLDAF as well as local through to international communication is a main aim of the organization as they believe that transparent communication allows umbrella organizations and WiLDAF members to learn from one an others experiences.
Development.
Under their Development aims, WiLDAF facilitates women to seek knowledge and empowerment through increased and established access to resources (such as economic, health, societal). This is done through a number of events notably training and workshops discussed below. Inter-connectivity is always underscored.
Law.
WiLDAF's main aims under law are to provide education for women about the law, how to use law, to facilitate their participation in it, and encourage workshops to create communities of empowered women that have the skills and confidence to use their lawful rights. The aims around protecting and promoting women's legal rights revolve around instances and events at which time laws should be upheld to protect women's safety and health, notably around issues with violence against women, sexual harassment, property rights, marriage and inheritance. There are many things that constitute violence against women including physical violence, rape, dowry deaths, genital mutilation or sexual slavery among many other acts.
Further discrimination more broadly defined includes a women's economic, social, and political position in regards to her standing in society as affected by institution, her marital or dependent status (children), as well as her accessibility to education, healthcare and reproductive rights. For example, one form of traditional discrimination against widows states that widows are to be locked up for 6 months after their husbands pass away and are often banned from many normal life activities such as making money. In these circumstances, the women usually end up living in poverty and loneliness with no support offered to them. Psychological discrimination such as widowhood practices often subordinates subjects and creates an environment that allows for the discrimination of those individuals in other ways as well. Here too does the conversation of private/public pertain in regards to the private domain oppressing the woman through an immunity of law. Psychological, cultural, economic, social and physical discrimination and violence are therefore interrelated because of a woman's vulnerable positioning in society, economy and politics. Laws are often not upheld in certain regions due to long histories of women suppression and a lack of education and available resources.
Projects and efforts.
WiLDAF has a number of projects and efforts it employs in accordance with their aims (some of which are briefly introduced above).
Advocacy, workshops and training.
Advocacy is an important facet of WiLDAF, as they often facilitate sensitization, workshops, debate meetings and also lobbying for changes in law in order to speak about violence towards women, female genital mutilation, sexual harassment, forced or underage marriages, HIV/AIDS education and the treatment of widows. WiLDAF uses many strategies to advocate their cause, including those above as well as the internet, news bulletins (WiLDAF News), publication, national surveys, medical services, aid, emergency response systems, and partnerships with other organizations in specific regions for localized needs. In addition, WiLDAF has been at the forefront of thinking about and integrating services for disabled women in Africa with a policy of mainstreaming disabilities for increased acceptance, tolerance and services.
Media campaigns.
WiLDAF created and distributed media campaigns to spread the awareness about women's rights in addition to their training sessions. Under their media campaigns, they also have information against domestic violence to empower women to claim their rights, seek legal actions and not stay silent against their oppressors.
Surveys.
One way in which WiLDAF maintains the international eye on women's rights in Africa is by publishing reports, or "country reports", on regions about various topics including common and customary law. They include anecdotal evidence from women survivors of violence, try to express the current standing of laws, express observations made in the region. This has also led to a study by WiLDAF into governmental accountability, and to explore the theories of government accountability used by the international human rights movement, established during the conference in Beijing.
Many African states today differ in their law make-up, and numerous operate in tiered manners including state-laws, customary and religious laws in regions of significant Muslim population. One of the ways in which WiLDAF uses these reports is to highlight areas of customary/religious laws which oppress women, and urge states to challenge these laws in light of international human rights agreements. These reports can take the form of shadow reports to highlight and support governmental reports in order to provide more information or show areas which the governmental reports may have not reported; they may also keep track of how legal reforms and laws have been integrated and enforced in specific regions. They publish these reports widely and internationally which invites the international eye in respect to regional goals around human rights and women participation in law, urging regions to improve their human rights laws.
Emergency response system.
WiLDAF's Emergency Response System was organized in an effort to provide immediate relief and support in the event of serious human rights violations against women in the countries they represent. It is to be called upon when those countries and its citizens feel powerless to the situation or require international support; such situations could be proposals for laws that go against human rights, infringement of goals set by states to offer women more resources or opportunities or direct violence on women. On average the Emergency Response System is used once a year.
This program is in support of WiLDAF's aim to offer aid and advocacy in areas of conflict and conflict situations.
Lobbying.
Lobbying is an important role of WiLDAF which has been improved and strengthened by international treaties, one of which notably is the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), passed in 1980. CEDAW in particular views rights, as WiLDAF does, through a gendered outlook by expanding rights for women rather than just granting those that men have. Through these treaties and their provision of legal mechanisms, organizations such as WiLDAF and women themselves are able to lobby for the implementation and revision of laws, as well as report response to CEDAW, by pressuring local governments. Lobbying takes place at the government of a specific region to reform current laws. Lobbying for rights has been made difficult by the Structural Adjustment Programs (SAP's) due to the programs governmental restructuring and opening to international corporations; this has caused a lack of faith in citizens of some regions on account of the state leaving basic services to be taken care of by other means.
16 days of activism against gender-based violence.
16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence is an event is adopted by WiLDAF as a series of 16 days between International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on November 25 and International Human Rights Day on December 10th. The annual project features many events such as projects, campaigns, or workshops that each region can plan independently with respect to their local needs. The activities are geared towards education and promotion of awareness through the regional inter-connectivity of these events.
Ghana.
Since 2007, Women in Law and Development in Africa - Ghana division - has been partnering with Crossroads International to educate and bring awareness surrounding the law and justice system to men and women. In addition to this, they provide support for women who have endured violence with their "Access to Justice Program".

Amyton, South Australia

Amyton is a locality in the Australian state of South Australia located on the eastern side of the Flinders Ranges about north of the state capital of Adelaide and about north-east of the municipal seat of Melrose.
Boundaries for the locality were created on 13 March 1997 and was given the “long established name” of Amyton which is derived from the former Government Town of Amyton.
The government town was intended to be the principal settlement of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Pinda. It was surveyed in January 1879 and laid out as “204 house allotments and 180 larger blocks and parklands.” It was proclaimed on 10 April 1879 and was named after the eldest daughter of William Jervois, the Governor of South Australia. It was diminished on 13 May 1954 by the cancellation of the loan registration book for the land intended for “school purposes” and resumption of all of the land intended for the school, parklands and the town, and was proclaimed to ‘cease to exist’ on 13 June 1957.
The town had as many as “four buildings and many temporary constructions” at one time and had a school in operation from 1881 to 1930. As of 2012, “nothing remains but a small pioneer cemetery” and “a few rubble heaps…” Geoffrey Manning, the South Australian historian, notes that the town was not successful because the “uncertainty of the rainfall” made the growing of wheat unviable, although farmers of the time could practise dairying as the “good variety of summer fodders, such as saltbush and blue bush” realized better financial returns than growing wheat.
Amyton is located within the federal division of Grey, the state electoral district of Stuart and the local government area of the District Council of Mount Remarkable.

Groundwater contamination from animal agriculture

Groundwater pollution, also referred to as groundwater contamination, is not as easily classified as surface water pollution. Groundwater aquifers are susceptible to contamination from sources that may not directly affect surface water bodies.
Analysis of groundwater contamination may focus on soil characteristics and site geology, hydrogeology, hydrology, and the nature of the contaminants. Causes of groundwater pollution include: naturally-occurring (geogenic), on-site sanitation systems, sewage, fertilizers and pesticide, commercial and industrial leaks, hydraulic fracturing, and landfill leachate.
Groundwater contamination in California impacts many regions, such as the Central Valley.
One of the sources of groundwater contamination can be linked to animal agriculture and Animal feed operations (AFO). These facilities tend to have a higher concentration of animal manure, which when stored improperly can cause problems by leaking into local groundwater and aquifers, causing groundwater contamination. Under the Clean Water Act, AFOs are considered a point source of pollution and are held to specific standards by the United States' Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Basic information.
According to the EPA in a 2007 survey, 10% of California's groundwater has a Nitrogen level greater than 5 mg/L. This equates to around 7% of the population that is drinking contaminated groundwater. Five mg/l is half of the EPA limit of allowed nitrogen in water. There are two primary sources of pollution for nitrogen: agriculture and septic systems. Agriculture can contribute from heavy use of fertilizer as well as animal agriculture waste. Over 68 published and peer-reviewed studies have been conducted since 2002, out of these studies 15 found direct links to groundwater pollution from animals' waste at CAFOs. Twelve of the studies made indirect links to water pollution and human health while seven found no link at all 
California ground water.
Due to factory farming practices and the use of nitrogen-rich fertilizers and animals waste in 1994 over 800 wells were closed in southern California, 130 of those well in the San Joaquin Valley. A study conducted in 1996 by the University of California, in which they monitored and surveyed 5 dairies in a high- risk groundwater area, higher levels of nitrates and salts were present under main milking areas, wastewater retention ponds and other land use areas. According to the Central Valley Dairy Representative Monitoring Program, some practices that are now implemented may not be represented in this data as some provisions of the 2007 General Order was only fully enforced and complete in 2012, when monitoring began.

Point source pollution.
In the United States, there are roughly 450,000 concentrated animal feed operations (CAFO) where cows are held for at least 45 days over a 1-year period, in which a single cow can defecate up to 120 lb of manure a day, which is the equivalent of 20-40 people. Under the Clean Water Act Section 502(14) a CAFO is considered a point source of pollution.
Regulation under the EPA.
With the federal law on the side of the EPA, EPA has the authority to specifically regulate CAFO's as a polluter. According to the Clean Water Act, CAFO's are considered like other polluting industry in which the business must acquire a permit to pollute and they must have several controls in place. CAFO's are defined under the EPA as three distinct sizes that are based on the number of animals housed are as follows:
"A Large CAFO confines at least the number of animals described in the table below.
A Medium CAFO falls within the size range in the table below and either:
• has a manmade ditch or pipe that carries manure or wastewater to surface water; or
• the animals come into contact with surface water that passes through the area where they’re confined.
If an operation is found to be a significant contributor of pollutants, the permitting authority may designate a
medium-sized facility as a CAFO.
A Small CAFO confines fewer than the number of animals listed in the table and has been designated as a
CAFO by the permitting authority as a significant contributor of pollutants. "

Convenience Store Woman

 is a 2016 novel by Japanese writer Sayaka Murata. It captures the atmosphere of the familiar convenience store that is so much part of life in Japan. The novel won the Akutagawa Prize in 2016. Aside from working as a writer, Murata worked at a convenience store three times a week, basing her novel on her experiences. It was first published in the June 2016 issue of "Bungakukai". It was published as a book in July 2016 by Bungeishunjū. 
The book has sold over 1.5 million copies in Japan. It is the first of Murata's novels to be translated into English. The translation, by Ginny Tapley Takemori, was released by Grove Press (US) and Portobello Books (UK) in 2018. It has been translated into more than 30 languages.
Plot.
Keiko Furukura is a 36-year-old woman who has been working part-time at a convenience store, or "konbini", for the last 18 years. She has known since childhood that she is "different" and that expressing her own views and actions is inexplicable and distressing to others, and causes problems. 
The highly regulated world of the "konbini", where each action is prescribed by the corporate manual, allows her to maintain an identity acceptable to those around her and a sense of purpose. She models her behaviour, dress style, and even speech patterns on those of her coworkers. Keiko maintains some friendships and a relationship with her sister, but finds it increasingly difficult to explain why, after 18 years, she is still single and working as a temp in a convenience store.
Keiko meets Shiraha, a man who cannot hold a steady job and lives on the fringes of society since he doesn't conform to "normal" expectations. While they have no affection for each other, Shiraha eventually moves in with Keiko. They decide that by pretending to be a couple, they can avoid problems with families and a society that expects them to have romantic relationships, children, and stable jobs.
As part of the plan, Keiko eventually quits her job in the "konbini", though she immediately feels that her life has lost purpose. She stays home doing nothing, and only at Shiraha's insistence applies for steady jobs.
On the way to the first job interview, Keiko and Shiraha stop at a "konbini". She sees that the store is not as regulated and immediately begins rearranging the merchandise and assisting the staff. When Shiraha confronts her, she explains that her purpose in life is to be a "konbini" employee, even though she knows that it would be easier and more convenient for her to live the semblance of a "normal" life with him. She then walks away from an enraged Shiraha, cancels the interview, and resolves to find herself a new "konbini".
Background.
Murata herself works at a convenience store on a part-time basis. In a profile for "The New York Times", the author explained she "wanted to illustrate how odd the people who believe they are ordinary or normal are" and that she admires Keiko's character, who chooses and is fine with not having sex at all. She says that she wanted to write from the perspective of "someone who defied conventional thinking, particularly in a conformist society".
Reception.
Joyce Lau of the "South China Morning Post" gave the novel four out of five stars, calling it a "cutting commentary on the pressure society puts on its citizens, particularly single women." Julie Myerson of "The Guardian" gave the novel a generally positive review, calling it "sublimely weird" and praising the "nutty deadpan prose and even more nuttily likable narrator."
The novel won the prestigious Akutagawa Prize, and Murata was named one of "Vogue Japan"s Women of the Year.
Radio adaptation.
The novel was adapted into a radio drama on NHK-FM's and was broadcast from 22:00 to 22:50 on 30 November 2019. Chiaki Kuriyama voiced the role of the protagonist Keiko Furukura.

According to Accuracy International, the development of the series was partly influenced by the Precision Sniper Rifle (PSR) U.S. Special Operations Command solicitation, an undertaking by the U.S. military for a new and improved Precision long range rifle. The PSR contract was ultimately granted to Remington's Modular Sniper Rifle.
Design.

Pine Ridge, Oregon

Pine Ridge was a company town located about a mile north of Chiloquin, Oregon, along the Williamson River, run by the Forest Lumber Company from 1924 to 1939. It included a sawmill, offices, hotel, school, residences, and company store. It was destroyed by a forest fire on August 19, 1939, and never rebuilt. The office vault was the only surviving structure, and a house was later built adjacent to it, incorporating it as a room.
A sawmill was built on the site around 1915 for Modoc Lumber Company, as well as a few houses. The area was originally known as "Aspgrove." Only the manager's house was built well; none of the others had complete bathrooms. After Forest Lumber bought the property, houses were built to a higher standard.

Shooting of Chaiyaphum Pasae

Chaiyaphum Pasae () was a teenage Lahu human rights activist from Thailand who worked on promoting minority ethnic group rights. He was killed at a military checkpoint in Chiang Dao District of Chiang Mai Province by army soldiers on 17 March 2017. The army insisted that Chaiyaphum had been found trafficking drugs, and was killed by soldiers in self-defence after brandishing a grenade and trying to escape custody, but eyewitness accounts stated that he was unarmed, and was beaten before being shot. The killing sparked disbelief in Thailand, and Human Rights Watch issued a statement calling for the case to be transparently investigated. Despite claiming that their version of events was supported by CCTV footage, the military has so far refused to release the video footage to the public.

Fraser first attracted widespread attention in 2013 with a series of Inuktitut-language covers of pop songs, most notably Rihanna's "Diamonds", on YouTube. She released her debut album, "Isuma", in 2014. Her songs include Inuktitut and English language, and musically, combine contemporary pop with traditional Inuit sounds. Fraser was dedicated to sharing Inuit culture with a widespread audience and raising awareness of present-day issues and Inuit rights; many of these themes feature heavily in her music.

<doc id="56574447" url="?curid=56574447" title="Nicola Mazza">
Nicola Mazza

Nicola Mazza (10 March 1790 – 2 August 1865) was an Italian Roman Catholic priest. Mazza was born in and served as a priest in Verona and was dedicated to both the evangelization of Central Africa (he used to be called "Don Congo" due to this) and equal access to a good education. He served as a teacher for over three decades as well as a chaplain and was known for his dedication to the Christian formation of children. Mazza was also a student and close friend to Saint Gaspare Bertoni and was also close with a range of prominent prelates including Saint Daniele Comboni whom he sent to the missions in Africa.
Mazza's beatification process opened in the 1920s and culminated on 3 June 2013 after Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue and named Mazza as Venerable.
Life.
Nicola Mazza was born on 10 March 1790 in Verona as the eldest of nine brothers to the silk and fabric merchants Luigi Mazza and Rosa Pajola. His parents managed a fabric store in the Piazza delle Erbe. The Mazza's moved to Marcellise in 1797 following the French occupation; the town was a hamlet of San Martino Buon Albergo. In 1821 his father was forced to sell his estate and villa due to financial difficulties.
He was a student to the priest Antonio Cesari and was also a close disciple to Saint Gaspare Bertoni who both proved to be strong influences on Mazza's life and personal spiritual inclinations. Cesari was brought in to homeschool Mazza since the latter's often frail health prevented him from going to school. His vocation matured under Cesari's guidance and he soon felt called to enter the priesthood as a more direct means to dedicate himself to the needs of the poor. He commenced his ecclesial studies in Verona on 21 June 1807 before Mazza received his ordination to the priesthood on 26 March 1814. Following his ordination he first served in the churches of S. Fermo Maggiore and San Nicolò before being assigned in 1816 to teach seminarians in Verona. For over three decades from 1816 until 1849 he taught students in Verona both mathematics (from 1815 to 1816) and, occasionally, physics and world history. The students held him in high regard as did fellow teachers while some of his students included the Venerable Antonio Provolo and Blessed Zefirino Agostini. It was also around this time that he became a confessor and close friend to the Venerable Teresa Campostrini. His professorship solidified his desire to create a range of opportunities for people to have a fairer and better access to education irrespective of their class or economic status. His companions around this point following his ordination - students and confreres alike - knew of Mazza's desire to evangelize Africa and referred to him as "Don Congo".
On 14 September 1838 the Emperor Ferdinand I awarded him a large golden medal with a necklace in tribute to Mazza's work in the field of culture and education.
Mazza sent six missionaries in 1857 to Central Africa with the hope of evangelizing the region which had been a lifelong ambition for him despite the fact that he never set foot on the African continent. He blessed the new missionaries which included Saint Daniele Comboni and Giovanni Beltrame who became prominent figures in the missions there. Mazza had also sent Francesco Oliboni and Angelo Melotto as well as Alessandro dal Bosco while also sending Isidoro Zilli who was neither a priest nor religious but a catechist. Mazza held the view that the African people alone could be successful in evangelizing since their efforts would be much more successful among their own people as opposed to foreigners.
His health began to decline in July 1865 and he died the following month. The local papers "Eco de Veneto" and "Nuova Gazzetta di Verona" followed the news of Mazza's declining health from the outset until Mazza's death a month later after news broke of his failing health. Mazza's remains are interred in the church of San Carlo Borromeo.
Beatification process.
Mazza's beatification process opened in 1925 in an investigation that had been launched in Verona and had closed in 1927 while a second process opened in that diocese in 1934 and was later closed in 1937. The third and final investigation into Mazza's life and works was launched several decades later in 1988 and closed not long after in 1989. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the investigation in Rome on 14 December 1990 and later received the Positio dossier from the postulation in two parts in 2000 and 2003 for assessment. It was in between that period that the historical consultants to the C.C.S. approved the cause on 1 October 2002 based on the part of the Positio that had been submitted in 2002. Theologians advising the C.C.S. likewise confirmed the cause a decade later on 21 February 2012 as did the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members on 21 May 2013.
Mazza was declared to be Venerable on 3 June 2013 after Pope Francis confirmed that the late priest had lived a life of heroic virtue.
The current postulator for this cause is Fr. Francesco Massagrande.

St Mary's Church, Whitchurch

St Mary's Church, Whitchurch is an Anglican place of worship in the suburb of Whitchurch, Cardiff. The Victorian building is listed.
Early Churches.
A church in the locality is first recorded in the twelfth century, though the date of its founding and its dedication are now unknown. At this time, Whitchurch was a chapel of ease to Llandaff Cathedral, and would remain so until the 19th Century. The first church which is known to have carried the dedication to Mary was first erected in the 14th Century. In the 15th or 16th Century, a porch was added, followed later still by a nave, then a belfry of Bath stone. The graveyard dated from 1616, when a licence for baptisms, marriages and burials was obtained. Later alterations to the interior were carried out in 1810. The old church could seat 300. Despite the fact that it was growing too small for the growing population (which the new Melingriffith Tin Plate Works had bolstered to 696), the issue of the church's inadequate facilities would not be addressed for several decades. During the 19th Century, Whitchurch also acquired its first Nonconformist places of worship, with the Whitchurch Methodist Church being founded in .
Modern Church.
As Whitchurch gradually evolved into a suburb over the 19th Century, the population of the district continued to expand. Whitchurch became a separate parish in 1845. The Revd. J.T. Clarke, who became the vicar of St Mary's in 1876, was dissatisfied by the inadequate (and increasingly rundown) church, and began to agitate for a replacement. The new church was finally provided in 1884, located around 300 metres to the south-south-west from its predecessor. It was designed by John Prichard, and was consecrated for worship in 1885. After its replacement came into use, the old church was largely abandoned and lapsed into decay. It was ruinous by the turn of the 20th Century and was demolished in 1904. Its graveyard remained until being converted into a public garden, St Mary's Gardens, in 1973, which is still extant on Old Church Road. The church became Listed in 1975.
Organisation.
The church is now in the Rectorial Benefice of Whitchurch. It has three daughter churches: All Saints (Rhiwbina), All Saints (Llandaff North) and St Thomas's (Birchgrove). The current Director of Music at St. Mary’s is Thomas Mottershead.

Blackstone Legal Fellowship

The Blackstone Legal Fellowship is an American legal training and internship program developed and facilitated by Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF). Since its inception in 2000, more than 1,900 law students have participated in the program. Its main campus is in Scottsdale, Arizona. Notable faculty have included Missouri U.S. Senator Josh Hawley and U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett.
Overview.
Blackstone Legal Fellowship is a highly competitive, nine week intensive summer legal training program which spans June though August. It was founded in 2000 for the purpose of preparing Christian law students for professional legal careers. The first class comprised 24 interns. Since its inception Blackstone has trained more than 1,900 Christian law students. In an interview, ADF co-founder Alan Sears said in 2000 Blackstone was created in response to his observation, "There’s got to be a better way for law students in America and for young lawyers than we currently have." The program is made up of interns, called Fellows, from a diverse selection of law schools as well as elite institutions such as Harvard and Yale. The program is named for Sir William Blackstone, the famed eighteenth century English legal scholar and jurist whose influential commentaries on the common law had a profound impact on the Founding Fathers of the United States.
In 2012, Sears was asked about the major achievements of ADF. He said "among the things I am most thankful for are our Blackstone Legal Fellowship graduates."
In 2017, President Donald Trump's nominee to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, Amy Coney Barrett, was criticized by Senator Al Franken for teaching constitutional law at Blackstone. In her Senate committee hearing he referred to ADF as a "hate group". Barrett responded that the hate group label is "controversial". Barrett was confirmed to the court by the Senate.
Program information.
The Blackstone Fellowship consists of three phases described as Learn, Lead, and Defend. Fellows spend the first two weeks of the program in the classroom studying in areas such as ethics, theology and jurisprudence. Sessions consist of lectures as well as hands-on interactive presentations.
The second phase of the program focuses on six-week field placements at a variety of venues across the United States and abroad including "public-interest law firms, attorneys, law professors, think tanks, and public-policy organizations." Placements are selected based on students' aptitude and career goals.
Finally, the Fellows return to ADF in Scottsdale for a week long series of presentations focusing on career development and professional networking. Speakers include legal academics, members of the judiciary, elected representatives, and practicing attorneys. Interns are given an orientation to the Blackstone alumni network.
Scholarship.
Blackstone Fellows receive a scholarship of $6,300. In addition, stipends are available to cover expenses during the placement phase of the program.

The following is a list of notable people who affiliated with Blackstone.

Flag of Sutherland

The Sutherland flag is the flag of the Scottish county of Sutherland. It was revealed on 14 December 2018 as the winner of competition in which over 3,000 people from the county voted.
The overlaid Saltire and Nordic crosses denote Sutherland's unique history on the mainland where the extent of Viking control met Scotland. The golden sun that is formed where the arms of the crosses meet symbolise the sun raised high in the south for the origin of the county's name "South Land" as well as the sunrises seen on the east coast and sunsets on Sutherland's west coast. The black recalls the peat of the Flow Country and dark skies and together with the white recall the central colours of the former Sutherland Council arms.
History.
A competition was established by the local community in conjunction with the Flag Institute, and a flag was announced as the winner in the Northern Times newspaper in January 2018. The design was selected by a judging panel. The county's Lord Lieutenancy, however, froze the flag's registration with the Court of the Lord Lyon in March 2018 in light of opposition to the flag's design and the nature of the competition. The Sutherland Flag Committee announced in October 2018 that a public vote would be held to choose a flag. The shortlist of designs chosen by the judging panel will include the originally announced design. 
Original design.
The original design announced by the Lord Lieutenancy in January 2018 features a swooping eagle, seen face on, against a vertical bicoloured red and yellow background, with the eagle counterchanged yellow and red. The bicolour of red and yellow represents the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea, which border the county on its west and east coasts respectively. At the hoist are three stars or mullets. These, plus the red and yellow colour combination, are taken from the arms borne by Hugh de Moray, Earl of Sutherland.
Reception.
After a county newspaper, "The Northern Times", published the final design, some Sutherland residents expressed disapproval, mainly through social media. Complaints focused on the colours, said to evoke communism, and that the eagle was crudely drawn and not the best choice to represent the region. It was suggested that the Scottish wildcat, a symbol associated with Sutherland, would have made a more appropriate choice. A spokesman for the flag selection committee countered that the "eagle featured prominently on a considerable number of the entries", that the wildcat is more associated with Caithness, and an eagle is more unifying as being prominent across the county.
The Court of the Lord Lyon started of the process of formally recognising the flag in early February 2018. A petition was put forth by one Sutherland resident to redesign the flag. The Vice Lord Lieutenant of Sutherland and chairman of the Flag Selection Committee asserted though that feedback, outside of social media, and especially from schools and young people from across Sutherland continues to indicate very strong support for the design. Due to the opposition towards the design, the office of the Lord Lyon halted the process of registering the flag, stating: "I understand that the petitioners (the Lord Lieutenancy) are considering the matter and, until we hear from them, no further procedures will take place in our office."
Public vote.
In October 2018, the Sutherland Flag Committee announced that a public vote would be held to choose the Sutherland flag. The shortlist of designs, selected by the judging panel, included the design originally announced as the flag, although it was ultimately not chosen by the public.

CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures

The CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) were published in 2012 by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems of the Bank for International Settlements and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions.
It sets out twenty-four principles to be followed to manage market risk in financial market infrastructure.
In the United Kingdom, the Bank of England acts as regulator for payment systems, central securities depositories and central counterparties. For these regulated organisations, the bank requires the operator complies with the CPSS-IOSCO principles.
Principles.
General organisation.
Principle 1: Legal basis.
The operations of the system must have a clear basis in the law of the jurisdictions it operates in. This is important to avoid the uncertainty that would result if there was the possibility that the courts might void or hold-up transactions.
Principle 2: Governance.
Market governance arrangements must be clear and transparent. They should support the stability of the market and take account of the wider public interest.
Principle 3: Framework for the comprehensive management of risks.
The market operator must have a proper risk management framework.
Credit and liquidity risk management.
Principle 4: Credit risk.
The market operator must carefully manage its credit exposure to market participants, and have sufficient resources to cover any credit risk it is exposed to.
Principle 5: Collateral.
If the market requires collateral, it must choose collateral with low credit, liquidity and market risks.
Principle 6: Margin.
Central counterparties must manage their credit exposure to market participants by ensuring they have an effective margin system.
Principle 7: Liquidity risk.
The market operator must monitor and manage liquidity risk.
Settlement.
Principle 8: Settlement finality.
Liabilities incurred must be settled with finality, at the very least at the end of the day where value is credited, but ideally in real-time.
Principle 9: Money settlements.
The system should settle in central bank money wherever possible. Credit risk and liquidity risk must be minimised.
Principle 10: Physical deliveries.
If the market deals with securities or commodities, there must be clear rules about their physical delivery.
Risks relating to the storage and delivery of physical securities and commodities must be managed.
Central securities depositories and exchange-of-value settlement systems.
Principle 11: Central securities depositories.
Where a securities depository holds the underlying securities of a market it must manage this 'safeguarding' risk, and ensure the securities are held separately from its own assets.
Principle 12: Exchange-of-value settlement systems.
Where two linked obligations are exchanged in a transaction (for example, foreign exchange), the settlement of one must be conditional on the settlement of the other.
Default management.
Principle 13: Participant-default rules and procedures.
The market needs to have rules to cope with the default of a market participant, ensuring the losses are contained and liquidity preserved to allow the market to continue to operate.
Principle 14: Segregation and portability.
For a central counterparty, it must be possible to segregate and move the positions of the participants' customers.
General business and operational risk management.
Principle 15: General business risk.
The market operator must manage its own business risks to ensure it can continue as a going concern. It must maintain a reserve to ensure it can be wound down in an orderly fashion if the need arises.
Principle 16: Custody and investment risks.
Assets, whether belonging to the market operator or market participants, must be safeguarded against losses. Any investments must be chosen for minimal credit, liquidity and market risks.
Principle 17: Operational risk.
A financial market must identify operational risks: both internally and across the market and its participants. Where appropriate, they should mitigate the risks through controls.
Systems used by the market must have a high degree of reliability and security, and must have sufficient capacity for the needs of the market.
Business continuity must be in place to recover from disruption.
Access.
Principle 18: Access and participation requirements.
Criteria for participating in the market must be objective and transparent, ensuring fair and open access.
Principle 19: Tiered participation arrangements.
Where the financial market has participants at different tiers (i.e. direct participants, and indirect participants who are themselves serviced by the direct participants) then the market operator needs to monitor and manage the risks that such indirect relationships could cause.
Principle 20: FMI links.
If a financial market infrastructure (FMI) is interlinked to another FMI then it needs to monitor and manage the risks relating to that relationship.
Efficiency.
Principle 21: Efficiency and effectiveness.
Financial markets should be structured to efficiently and effectively meet the needs they were created to serve.
Principle 22: Communication procedures and standards.
The market should use relevant and internationally accepted methods of communicating transactions.
Transparency.
Principle 23: Disclosure of rules, key procedures, and market data.
The rules and procedures of the financial market must be clear. Participants must have sufficient information to enable them to understand the risks that they take by participating in the market, and the costs of doing so.
Rules and key procedures must be disclosed publicly.
Principle 24: Disclosure of market data by trade repositories.
A trade repository must disclose relevant market information to the public and government authorities that is timely and accurate.

Ortaköy, Uludere

 
 Ortaköy is a village in the district of Uludere in Şırnak province, Turkey. Ortaköy is away from the district of Uludere and it is located in southeastern Turkey, just on the western border of the Hakkari province. Historically, it was located in the Assyrian region of Hakkari.
History.
The village used to be part of Assyria, in "Ārosh Taxtayta" (Lower Arosh) within the historical Assyrian district of Tyari and was populated by Assyrian people up until Seyfo in 1914. The Assyrian village "Ārosh Alayta" (Upper Arosh), now named Yukariarus, in Hakkari, is less than away, closely bordering the province of Sirnak. Halmon is around to the northeast in Andaç and Gérāmon to the northwest, just right next to Halmon. Assyrian inhabitants of these proximate villages have ever since intermixed.

Albert Saléza

Albert Saléza (18 October 1867 – 26 November 1916) was a French tenor.
Biography.
Born in Bruges, last child of a large family of 12 children, and, as an orphan from the age of 8 years old, Saléza was sent to a Girondine property of senator where he became an assistant shepherd. But the country sickness forced him to return to his native commune where he became a sandal worker. Difficulty feeding led him to accept a job as a gravel digger on the Pau-Laruns railway, then as a sandaler in Bayonne, where wages were higher.
At his places of work, his voice was noticed by two Basque music lovers, who introduced him to the director of the music school, Mr. Jubin, and then to his first teacher, Gaston Salzedo. With this one, Saléza, who had hitherto received only a basic education, made rapid progress in all fields: instruction, diction, singing, music... so much so that he won the First prize of the school in 1886, which allowed him to integrate the Conservatoire de Paris where he won again the first prize in singing and the second prize in opera before a jury composed notably of Léo Delibes and Ambroise Thomas.
On leaving the conservatory, because of his fragile health, he chose the Opéra-Comique instead of the Opera which would have been too demanding so quickly. From his first role, Mylio in "Le roi d'Ys", his performance aroused the enthusiasm of the audience at the Salle Favart. From the Opéra-Comique, Albert Saléza moved on to the Opéra de Nice where he recovered his strength. He gained further notoriety by interpreting "Faust", "Roméo et Juliette", "Carmen", "Richard III"...
In 1892, Ernest Reyer noticed him and offered him the consecration by giving him a role tailored to his needs at the Paris Opera: Matho in "Salammbô". The triumph he obtained allowed him to repeat success after success: "Le Cid", "Die Walküre", "la Damnation de Faust" His fame was so great that Verdi offered him the role of "Otello" that he performeded 35 times until May 1895.
Unfortunately, health problems hit his vocal chords and forced him to stop for 2 years. In 1897, Saléza returned to the Opéra de Paris, then, in Monte Carlo, Brussels and Covent Garden of London where he sang in particular in "Carmen" with Emma Calvé, and "Roméo et Juliette" with Nellie Melba, and very often in front of the future king Edward VII. He reached the pinnacle of his glory in Chicago and the Metropolitan of New York, thanks to his interpretations in "Faust", "Lucia di Lammermoor", "Les Huguenots"…
In 1912, after all these successes abroad, he returned to France and was appointed professor of lyric declamation at the Conservatoire where his results turned out to be excellent with students who won all the first prizes. But on 26 November 1916, this new career came to a sudden halt when he collapsed during a mass in the .
Saléza married in 1895 to Pauline Bonnecarrère (1875–1953) and had three children: Mylio (1896–1957), Madeleine (1899–1913), and José (1905–?). He died on 26 November 1916 in the 17th arrondissement of Paris.
Legacy.
An Albert Saléza fund was created from 21 handwritten notebooks relating the career of the French tenor, excerpts from press articles and photographs, all from the collection of Mylio Saléza (for photographs) and his wife Marie-Louise, who kept the memory of her father-in-law until her death in 1995.

Strabops

Strabops is a genus of strabopid, an extinct group of arthropods. "Strabops" is known from a single specimen from the Late Cambrian (Furongian age) of the Potosi Dolomite, Missouri, collected by a former professor, Arthur Thacher. It is classified in the family Strabopidae of the monotypic order Strabopida, a group closely related to the aglaspidids with uncertain affinities. The generic name is composed by the Ancient Greek words στραβός, meaning "squinting", and ὄψῐς, meaning "face" (and therefore, "squinting face").
The history of "Strabops" has been turbulent and confusing since its original description by Charles Emerson Beecher, who classified it as a eurypterid. Many authors do not agree with this and have classified "Strabops" and its allies as part of the Aglaspidida order, while others classify them in their own order. Although the latter is the taxonomic position currently accepted, other paleontologists prefer to simply omit the strabopids from their analyzes due to the poor preservation of their fossils. In addition, it has been suggested that the closely related "Paleomerus" represents a synonym of "Strabops", which are uniquely differentiated by the size of the telson (the posteriormost division of the body) and the position of the eyes.
Description.
As the other strabopids, "Strabops" was a small-sized arthropod, measuring only 11 centimetres (4.3 inches) in length. Other Cambrian arthropods reached much greater lengths, such as the gigantic anomalocarid genus "Anomalocaris" that surpassed . However, it was the largest of the strabopids, surpassing "Paleomerus" (9.3 cm, 3.7 in) and "Parapaleomerus" (9.2 cm, 3.6 in).
Like some other arthropod groups, the strabopids possessed segmented bodies and jointed appendages (limbs) covered in a cuticle composed of proteins and chitin. The arthropod body is divided into two tagmata (sections); the anterior prosoma (head) and posterior opisthosoma (abdomen). The appendages were attached to the prosoma, and although they are unknown in strabopids (except for one undescribed specimen of "Parapaleomerus"), it is most likely they owned several pairs of them. Although the chemical composition of the strabopid exoskeleton is unknown, it was probably mineralized (with inorganic substances), sturdy and calcareous (containing calcium). The head of the strabopids was very short, the back was rounded and lacked trilobation (being divided into three lobes), the abdomen was composed by 11 segments and was followed by a thick tail-like spine, the telson.
In the genus "Strabops", the prosoma was short and broad, with a rounded outline. The eyes were located in the middle of the front of the prosoma. These were medium-sized, ovate and narrow, and pointed obliquely inwards (hence the name "Strabops"). Two spots between the eyes indicate the presence of the ocelli (light-sensitive simple eyes). In its abdomen, there were eleven segments, being the third the widest. The ends of the segments were rounded on the sides. In the posterior part of the segments, a row of tiny crenulations was visible. The first six segments were uniform in size, the three following ones were somewhat shorter and the last two were the longest. The telson was a broad, flat spine, and it rose slightly in the middle. The appendages are unknown, although it has been suggested that they be less than seven pairs (what has been considered an overestimate).
"Strabops" differed only from "Paleomerus" in the position of the eyes, which were closer together and farther from the margin than in "Paleomerus", and the size of the telson, being longer and narrower than in the latter.
History of research.
"Strabops" is known by one only well preserved specimen (YPM 9001, housed at the Peabody Museum of Natural History). It was found by Arthur Thacher, a former professor at the Washington University, in the Potosi Dolomite of the St. Francois County, Missouri. The specimen was sent to Yale University, Connecticut. The American paleontologist Charles Emerson Beecher described it as the only Cambrian eurypterid, "Strabops thacheri", the generic name derived from the Ancient Greek words στραβός ("strabós", squinting) and ὄψῐς ("ópsis", face) and refers to the inward turning eyes. He considered "Strabops" different enough from the other eurypterids to erect a new genus, although he did not assign it to any family. In 1912, the American paleontologists John Mason Clarke and Rudolf Ruedemann assigned "Strabops" to the Eurypteridae family, as well as affirming the possession of a twelfth segment and changing the position of the eyes from anterolateral (in the middle of the front) to lateral.
In his book "Cambrian Merostomata" of 1939, the American paleontologist and geologist Gilbert Oscar Raasch considered the descriptions of the joint authorship of 1912 erroneous and agreed with Beecher on all aspects of his description, except for some reservations about the ocelli. Despite its initial classification as a eurypterid, Raasch admitted that the description of "Strabops" concurred with the old thought of what an aglaspidid was. It is possible that Beecher was unaware of the similarity between it and "Aglaspis" because of the distorted illustration of the latter by the American zoologist and paleontologist Robert Parr Whitfield. Therefore, Raasch placed "Strabops" under the family Aglaspididae in the order Aglaspida.
In 1971, the Swedish geologist and paleontologist Jan Bergström tentatively removed Strabopidae (at that time containing "Strabops" and "Neostrabops") and Paleomeridae (only containing "Paleomerus") from the order Aglaspidida based on the fact that the head tagma was too short to accommodate the six pairs of appendages then assumed to be present in aglaspidids. Instead, he classified them in an uncertain order in the Merostomoidea class together with the emeraldellids. Ironically, Bergström speculated that the number of pairs of appendages present in the three genera could be fewer than seven, as well as including a possible antennal segment. This is currently observed as an overestimate. A study published by Derek Ernest Gilmor Briggs "et al." in 1979 has shown that "Aglaspis spinifer" had between four and five pairs of appendages, but not six, weakening Bergström's argument.
In 1997, Bergström and Hou Xianguang, a Chinese paleontologist, completely removed Strabopidae (recognizing Paleomeridae as a junior synonym), as well as the family Lemoneitidae (containing "Lemoneites"), from the order Aglaspidida to erect a new order, Strabopida, this time suggesting a number of no more than two pairs of appendages. However, this new clade (group) remained under the similarly-named Aglaspida subclass. A year later, the British paleontologists Jason Andrew Dunlop and Paul Antony Selden eliminated Strabopida from the suborder Aglaspidida and classified them as the sister taxa of the latter based on the lack of aglaspidid apomorphies (distinctive characteristics), such as the lack of genal spines (a spine placed in the posterolateral part of the prosoma). Other authors have reinforced this argument by the trapezoidal telson form of "Paleomerus" and "Strabops" in contrast to the long styliform telson of the aglaspidids. However, some authors prefer to represent the taxonomic position of the strabopids as uncertain due to the poor preservation of their fossils.
Classification.
"Strabops" is classified in its own order, Strabopida, in the clade Arachnomorpha, along with "Paleomerus", "Parapaleomerus" and potentially "Khankaspis". It was described originally as the only Cambrian eurypterid, and later as an aglaspidid. It would not be until 1997 when the order Strabopida was described, but there is still doubt if the exclusion of them from Aglaspidida was really correct. The current status of the strabopids is of aglaspidid-like arthropods of uncertain affinities.
"Strabops" shares with the other strabopids a series of characteristics that distinguish them all from the other arthropods. These are an abdomen divided into eleven segments followed by a thick spine, the telson. The head was short with sessile compound eyes. The back was rounded. Like "Paleomerus", "Strabops" possessed prominent dorsal eyes, however, there is no evidence of this in the fossils of "Parapaleomerus".
The great similarity that "Strabops" and "Paleomerus" share has cast doubt on many authors about whether both genera are really synonymous or not. The Norwegian paleontologist and geologist Leif Størmer described "Paleomerus" as an intermediate form between Xiphosura (commonly known as horseshoe crabs) and Eurypterida, only highlighting a unique feature different from "Strabops", a twelfth segment. Nevertheless, a fourth specimen found in Sweden has shown that this extra segment actually represented the telson of the animal, making them virtually indistinguishable. Although this should convert both genera into synonyms, over time, more differences have been highlighted, such as the position of the eyes (closer to each other and farther from the margin in "Strabops" than in "Paleomerus") and the size of the telson (longer and narrower in "Strabops" than in "Paleomerus"), which keeps them as separate but closely related genera.
The cladogram below published by Jason A. Dunlop and Paul A. Selden (1998) is based on the major chelicerate groups (in bold, Aglaspida, Eurypterida and Xiphosurida, Scorpiones and other arachnid clades) and their outgroup taxa (used as a reference group). "Strabops" and "Paleomerus" are shown as the sister taxa of Aglaspida.
Note that there are several outdated elements. For example, "Lemoneites" was remitted to the Glyptocystitida order of echinoderms in 2005.
Paleoecology.
The type and only known specimen of "Strabops" has been found in Furongian (Upper Cambrian) deposits in eastern Missouri. "Strabops" was at least an inhabitant of the sea, if not born in it. In addition, there are two specimens of the marine brachiopod "Obolus lamborni" and a poorly preserved trilobite head attached to the slab.

Borchgrevinkium

Borchgrevinkium is an extinct genus of chelicerate arthropod. A fossil of the single and type species, "B. taimyrensis", has been discovered in deposits of the Early Devonian period (Lochkovian epoch) in the Krasnoyarsk Krai, Siberia, Russia. The name of the genus honors Carsten Borchgrevink, an Anglo-Norwegian explorer who participated in many expeditions to Antarctica. "Borchgrevinkium" represents a poorly known genus whose affinities are uncertain.
It had several unique characteristics that differentiated it from many other arthropods, such as its long parabolic (nearly U-shaped) prosoma (head), its elongated first and second segments and the presence of paired "ridges" in the surface of its third to tenth tergites (dorsal halves of the segments). Furthermore, the opisthosoma (the "trunk") of "Borchgrevinkium" was triangular, and its telson (the posteriormost division of its body), short and wedge-shaped. It was a small animal, approximately long.
The only known specimen of the genus was collected in 1956 and described in 1959 by the Russian paleontologist Nestor Ivanovich Novojilov. He determined that it was a eurypterid and classified it in the family Mycteroptidae. However, its classification changed repeatedly over the years, being transferred from Eurypterida to Xiphosura and back to Eurypterida some time later. "Borchgrevinkium" is tentatively considered as a prosomapod, with more fossil material needed to ensure its current classification.
Description.
The size of the only known specimen of "Borchgrevinkium", identified with the label PIN 1271/1, is estimated more or less at , making it a small arthropod.
The prosoma was longer than wider (covering one third of the length of the animal), parabolic (nearly U-shaped) and with a length of . The eyes are not preserved and therefore, their position or shape is unknown. The prosomal appendages (limbs) are only known by the tip of poorly preserved left pairs. They were short, undifferentiated and spiniferous. The opisthosoma (the "trunk") was triangular and long. It was composed of 12 segments, with the first one being exceptionally long and forming with the second segment an "extension" of the prosoma. The genital appendage (a ventral "rod" part of the reproductive system) of "Borchgrevinkium" was long, spanning from its first to its second segment.
The third to tenth tergites (dorsal halves of the segments) had distal (outwards-pointing) lobes on their sides that delimitated the dorsal and ventral parts of the opisthosoma. Furthermore, these tergites had on their surfaces converging paired "folds" or "ridges" that progressively narrowed to the center of the tenth tergite. These ridges were almost parallel to the lateral lobes. On the eleventh tergite, the edges were slightly curved. The pretelson (the segment that preceded the telson) had a bifid (divided into two lobes) dorsal projection. The telson (the posteriormost division of the body) was cuneiform (wedge-like), short and narrow, and measured . The ornamentation of the body was composed by short scales with broadly rounded edges.
History of research.
In 1956, the Russian paleontologist and geologist Vladimir Vasilyevich Menner discovered a series of fossils in Devonian deposits near the Imangda River at the southwest of the Taymyr Peninsula, near Norilsk, in the Krasnoyarsk Krai (Russia, then the Soviet Union). He sent them to the Russian paleontologist Nestor Ivanovich Novojilov, who in 1959 described, among others, a specimen labelled as PIN 1271/1, which was nearly complete. It was deposited in the Paleontological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, in Moscow, where it remains. Novojilov considered it unique enough to be erected as a new genus, "Borchgrevinkium", named after the Anglo-Norwegian explorer Carsten Borchgrevink for his expeditions to Antarctica. He compared it with the then xiphosuran genus "Weinbergina", assuming that "Borchgrevinkium" was also a xiphosuran. However, the Norwegian paleontologist Leif Størmer, who assisted him during his study, noticed that what Novojilov had considered to be an accidental fissure was actually part of the "macrosegment" (the first segment), finding as well the tip of the appendages after closer examination. The presence of this macrosegment convinced Novojilov that "Borchgrevinkium" represented a new eurypterid, and he classified it as such.
In 1966, the American paleontologist Erik Norman Kjellesvig-Waering, during a study on the families and genera of the superfamily Stylonuracea (now known as Stylonuroidea), tentatively recorded an Upper Silurian occurrence of the genus "Borchgrevinkium" apart from the Lower Devonian one, believing that a new specimen had been found. This specimen was later named as ""Borchgrevinkium" sp.". In 2017, the British geologist and paleobiologist James C. Lamsdell and the Irish palaeontologist Derek Briggs found that this specimen was YPM IP 300790, collected in the Bertie Formation in the state of New York in 1967 by Samuel J. Ciurca, Jr., who identified it as a new undescribed species of "Borchgrevinkium" after contacting Størmer. Nevertheless, since this specimen was misidentified, it was redescribed as a new species of the chasmataspidid "Diploaspis", "D. praecursor", by Lamsdell and Briggs.
The history of "Borchgrevinkium" soon became turbulent, being classified as a xiphosuran in 1989, and back to Eurypterida years later. "Borchgrevinkium" was tentatively moved by Lamsdell in 2013 to the clade (taxonomic group) Prosomapoda.
Classification.
Novojilov, during his description of "Borchgrevinkium", noted a certain resemblance to "Weinbergina", especially for the paired "ridges" that both have on their tergites. Based on the aforementioned macrosegment, Novojilov classified the genus as a mycteroptid eurypterid and compared it to the species "Mycterops matthieui" and "Woodwardopterus scabrosus" (members of the family), without finding many similarities but still classifying "Borchgrevinkium" in the eurypterid group. Nowadays, however, his descriptions are considered inexhaustive and based only on the best preserved material. Nevertheless, the genus continued being considered by other authors as a eurypterid. In 1966, Kjellesvig-Waering classified "Borchgrevinkium" with "Woodwardopterus" in the family Woodwardopteridae. He based this conclusion on the similarity of the ornamentation, the shape of the prosoma and the exceptional size of the first two segments of both.
In 1972, Størmer questioned the affiliation of the genus in this clade and suggested that it might represent a chasmataspidid within the order Xiphosura. Following this recommendation, Victor P. Tollerton, Jr. reclassified it in 1989 inside this order during his revision of Eurypterida. In 2004, the Norwegian paleontologist Odd Erik Tetlie did not support this change and transferred "Borchgrevinkium" as eurypterid, again in the family Woodwardopteridae with "Woodwardopterus" and "Mycterops", but now in a different suborder, Woodwardopterina, suggesting that these arthropods actually could not represent eurypterids. The woodwardopterines were presumably united by the great elongation of the first two segments. This point of view was not approved by other researchers, and eventually Woodwardopterina was synonymized with Stylonurina and Woodwardopteridae with Mycteroptidae. In addition, Lamsdell considered the genus as needing a redescription.
Nowadays, "Borchgrevinkium" is a highly uncertain and problematic genus. Its eurypterid nature was soon denied again in 2013, when Lamsdell placed it in the clade Prosomapoda. It encompasses all chelicerates with prosomal uniramous appendages (appendages composed of a single series of segments attached end-to-end) in the adult stage (excluding the sixth and last pair of appendages). However, the appendages of "Borchgrevinkium" are poorly known. Lamsdell made a note in it and in "Anderella", determining that in order to consolidate the classification of both genera in Prosomapoda, new fossil material is needed.
A phylogenetic analysis (the results presented in a cladogram below) conducted by Lamsdell in 2013 on the relationships within Xiphosura and the relations to other closely related groups concluded that Xiphosura, as presently understood, was paraphyletic (that is, it was a group sharing a last common ancestor but not including all descendants of this ancestor) and thus not a valid phylogenetic group. Prosomapoda was erected to include several chelicerates formerly classified mostly as xiphosurans, as well as the xiphosurans themselves and Planaterga. "Borchgrevinkium" was not included due to its scarce known material.
Paleoecology.
The only known specimen of "Borchgrevinkium" has been recovered in Early Devonian (Lochkovian) deposits of the Taymyr Peninsula in Siberia, Russia. It was found alongside specimens of the chasmataspidids "Dvulikiaspis menneri", "Heteroaspis stoermeri" and "Skrytyaspis andersoni", as well as indeterminate eurypterids like "Acutiramus". The lithology (physical characteristics of the rocks) of the place has been described as dark gray marls with gypsiferous and dolomitic; rich in dolomite occurrences. The fossils were collected below the Early Devonian–Middle Devonian boundary.

10 Times Better

10 Times Better (, 10VM), whose official name is Italy 10 Times Better, is a liberal political party in Italy.
History.
10 Times Better was founded in December 2017 by the Venetian entrepreneur, Andrea Dusi, to run in the 2018 general election; Dusi's aim is to create an Italian equivalent of Ciudadanos, the Spanish liberal party led by Albert Rivera.
10VM wants to restart investing funds on enterprises, on tourism and innovation which are considered the key points to re-launch Italy. Dusi often stressed that his party is completely the opposite of the Five Star Movement, the anti-establishment party which some commentators have compared to 10VM.
The party's slogan is "Italy Deserves to Be Ten Times Better".
In July 2018 the founder Andrea Dusi decided to leave the political party to continue his activity as civic leader through Impactscool, a no profit organization aiming to prepare the youngests to the future.
On 18 April 2019 three Deputies joined the party. The party voted against the motion of confidence to the Conte II Cabinet.
In September four deputies officially left Forza Italia in order to join "Cambiamo!". Along with a fifth deputy (Giorgio Silli), they renamed the "Dream Italy–10 Times Better" sub-group within the Mixed Group as "Cambiamo!–10 Times Better".
Election results.
In the political election of the 4th of March, 10VM obtained 37859 votes (0.11%). Best results in Verona where the political leader, Andrea Dusi, obtained 0.82% .

Unun (band)

Unun were an Icelandic pop-rock band from Reykjavik. It was formed by Gunnar Lárus Hjálmarsson and Þór Eldon Jónsson (Thor Eldon) in 1993. They were joined by Ragnheiður Eiríksdóttir (Heiða) in 1994. The group disbanded in July 1999.
Biography.
The group was formed in 1993 by guitarist Þór Eldon Jónsson (formerly Fan Houtens Koko, of The Sugarcubes, aka Thor Eldon, and former husband of Björk), bassist Gunnar Lárus Hjálmarsson (Dr. Gunni, former SH Draumur, ex-Bless). The name appeared during a game of Scrabble. They were then joined by Kristín Jónsdóttir on vocals, then the trio goes back to Gunni's apartment. On April 1, 1994, they began recording their first studio album, titled "Æ". During their sessions, the singer Ragnheiður Eiríksdóttir (Heiða) becomes a member of the group. In November 1994, their first album was released on the label Smekkleysa (Bad Taste). Jóhann Jóhannsson (formerly of Daisy Hill Puppy Farm), co-produces and plays keyboards on this album.
In the spring of 1995 , the Icelandic lyrics of "Æ" are translated into English and the English version, "Super Shiny Dreams", is released on the Bad Taste label in November 1995 in the United States and Europe. Björk is supported by Unun for three British dates, including an appearance at Wembley Arena in January 1996. In 1997, the group participates in the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. In 1998, the group lost its contract with the label Deceptive, but managed to publish a four-track EP called "Bones". Thor performs his last concert with Unun at the Midt Fyn Festival. Back in Iceland, the band records their second album, "Ótta", with Birna on keyboards, Viddi (ex-Quarashi) on bass, and Doddi (Kanada) on drums. The following year Unun toured Norway, Lithuania, Estonia and Finland. The group disbanded in July 1999.
Unun (Dr. Gunni, Heiða and Elvar) reunited briefly in 2007 for a concert dedicated to Lee Hazlewood.

Ted Corbett (chemist)

Robert Edward Corbett (13 June 1923 – 3 February 2018) was a New Zealand organic chemist. He is noted for his contribution to natural product chemistry through the isolation and structural elucidation of compounds from New Zealand native plants.
Early life and education.
Born on 13 June 1923, Corbett was the son of Walter Corbett and Margaret Whitehead Corbett (née Robertson). He studied at the University of Otago, graduating Master of Science with first-class honours in chemistry in 1945. Corbett later undertook doctoral studies at the University of Cambridge under Alexander Todd on the structures of some of the metabolites—puberulic acid, puberulonic acid, and stipitatic acid—of "Penicillium" species. He showed that they contain the tropolone skeleton, and his PhD thesis, titled "The structure of certain antibiotics" was completed in 1950.
In 1949, Corbett married Enid Mary Carter in Cambridge, England, and they went on to have two children.
Academic and research career.
In 1945, Corbett was appointed as a lecturer in chemistry at Otago. After returning from Cambridge in 1950, Corbett rose to become a professor in 1966, and the Mellor Professor of Chemistry in 1972. When he retired in 1983, he was accorded the title of professor emeritus.
Corbett's research at Otago was primarily concerned with the study and structural elucidation of essential oils isolated from New Zealand native plants by steam distillation. Under his supervision in 1970, doctoral student Denis Lauren first isolated the diterpene compound from the rimu tree ("Dacrydium cupressinum") that came to be known as laurenene. Corbett also investigated extractives from barks, leaves, heartwoods and lichens, and determined the structures of many new, and derivatives of known, di-, tri- and sesquiterpenoids. He also studied the synthesis and rearrangement of some of the compounds that his team isolated.
Later life and death.
In retirement, the Corbetts lived in Tauranga. Enid Corbett died there in 2012, and Ted Corbett died on 3 February 2018, also in Tauranga.
Honours and awards.
In 1972, Corbett was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand. He was also a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Chemistry.

Vitals Global Healthcare

Vitals Global Healthcare (VGH) is a healthcare company based in Malta. It manages Public–private partnerships and works with Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry.
Bid.
In 2014 it "formulated a bid for the management and administration of a number of hospitals in the Maltese Islands".
Contract terms.
VGH had a 30 year concession on healthcare services in the Gozo, Karin Grech and St Lukes hospitals and was paid €49.5 million by the Government of Malta in 2016 and 2017. 
Ownership.
VGH ownership was said to be the "Bluestone Group" however it now appears it was controlled by the Bluestone Special Situations #4 Limited (BVI) which in turn is owned by BVI company Asia Harimau Investments Ltd which is owned by Mark Edward Pawley, a senior advisor to Oxley Capital Group.
Other parties received share option agreements granting them rights to percentages of shares in VGH without showing up as owners of VGH.
When VGH Malta was created, an identically named company was established in Jersey, together with 11 other companies, Sri Ram Tumuluri is named as an investor who created the Jersey companies. The Jersey companies included ones designed to support a bid for a similar style VGH hospital projects in Kosovo and Montenegro.
Cash flow problems.
In August 2017, Kexby Finance Limited which had lent Asia Harimau Investments money in April 2016 asked the BVI courts to declare Asia Harimau Investments bankrupt, documents filed showed that when the initial acquisition by VGH was undertaken there was insufficient funds available to fund the initial €500,000 consultancy bills resulting in borrowings from Dr Amrish Gupta.
In 2017 VGH was paid €75 million to run the hospitals, but incurred costs of €94 million, resulting in a loss of €18 million, up from a loss of €6 million in 2016. 
Sale to Steward Global Healthcare.
VGH was sold to Steward Global Healthcare in January 2018 for a nominal €1, the sale precipitated a doctors' strike.
VGH received €50 million from the Maltese government to allow the sale to go through.
Controversy.
VGH was being investigated by investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia before her murder in October 2017.
Three Maltese Government Ministers at the time, Edward Scicluna, Chris Cardona and Konrad Mizzi, face investigation regarding VGH taking control of the three hospitals under a contract to last for 30 years in 2015. 
Accusations that the bidding process was skewed, with the bidding process announcing 3 bids, one of which was only a letter of non-interest, the second was from a small company operating a single hospital in India and VGH. The contract terms were also considered biased with the government having to bail out VGH if it got into debt and it would cost €100 million plus pay company debts to buy the contract back.

Marianna Salzmann

Sasha Marianna Salzmann (born in Volgograd, Soviet Union on 21 August 1985) is a German playwright, essayist, theatre curator and novelist. She is writer in residence at the Maxim Gorki Theatre in Berlin where she was artistic director of the studio theatre, Studio Я, from 2013 to 2015.
Life.
Salzmann grew up in Moscow until 1995, when she and her family emigrated to Germany as Jewish . She studied literature, drama and media studies at the University of Hildesheim and "creative writing for the stage" at the Berlin University of the Arts.
Theatre career.
Throughout her studies in Hildesheim, she had poems and short stories published in various magazines, and, together with Deniz Ultu, Mutlu Ergün, Marcela Knapp and Mike Klesse, she founded the cultural and social magazine , where she was editor from 2002 to 2013. Alongside her studies, she also staged two plays with Wera Mahne: "Ein Attentat auf Godot" (‘An Attempt on Godot’), a loose adaptation of Beckett’s classic, and "Rot Werden" (‘Turning Red’), a sarcastic romantic monologue to Vladimir Putin. In collaboration with the music theatre collective "forte blau", Salzmann developed projects for the deaf, hard of hearing and hearing. With "Grenzkollektiv", she created a parody of the Joan of Arc story—"Jeanne ist tot und kommt heute nicht mehr vorbei" (‘Joan’s Dead and Won’t be Coming Round Today’).
During her studies in Berlin, Salzmann’s first full-length play "Weißbrotmusik" (Engl.: "white bread music") won the Wiener Wortstaettenpreis 2009 and the IKARUS Prize for Best Youth Play 2012. In 2012, she was also awarded the Kleist Prize for Young Dramatists for her play "Muttermale Fenster blau", and in 2013, her graduation play "Muttersprache Mameloschn" (Engl.: "mother tongue Mameloschn") won the Mülheim Audience Award for Play of the Year and was voted Best Play by theatre critics. In 2018, she was awarded the Nestroy Theatre Prize for "best off production" for that same play.
In 2014, she and Maxi Obexer co-founded the NIDS, "Neues Institut für Dramatisches Schreiben" (Engl.: "New Institute for Writing for the Stage"), an institute whose purpose is to raise public awareness of the societal importance of the art of drama, and to strengthen a kind of art whose original function was to encourage a type of culture that encourages critical debates and discussions. 
Since 2013, Salzmann has been writer in residence at the Maxim Gorki Theatre Berlin, where she previously headed the Conflict Zone Arts Asylum collective at Studio Я, an "undernational network of artists, activists, authors, performers and curators who believe that aesthetics is the better ethics, art the better politics, language the most powerful force."
‘The Maxim Gorki Theatre is the “Theatre of the Year”,’ "Welt" journalist Stefan Grund wrote. ‘One reason is Sasha Marianna Salzmann who is director of the most exciting experimental theatre in Germany—Studio Я.’ In 2016, the verdict of German theatre magazine "Die Deutsche Bühne" was equally enthusiastic: ‘Salzmann, with her sensitive eye for the brutality of the present age and her biographical glimpses into the past, is perhaps "the" German-language dramatist of the moment’ (Detlev Baur).
Together with Max Czollek, Salzmann curated the ‘Disintegration Congress’ (2016) and the ‘Radical Jewish Culture Days’ (2017), two social sculptures where international figures addressed questions of contemporary Jewish identity. ‘The Maxim Gorki Theatre used to be a post-migrant theatre,’ Dirk Pilz wrote in the "Berliner Zeitung". ‘Now it’s a disintegration theatre. Disintegration means: "I’m not joining in." The one thing it doesn’t mean is: "I’m keeping out of this."’ As part of the Radical Jewish Culture Days, Salzmann directed "Die Geschichte vom Leben und Sterben des neuen Juppi Ja Jey Juden" (‘The Life and Death of the New Yippee Yeah Yeah Jews’), a theatre monologue by Sivan Ben Yishai.
Prose.
During a residency at the in Istanbul in 2012/13, Salzmann began work on her debut novel, "Beside Myself", which she finished writing on subsequent visits to Turkey. The novel was published by Suhrkamp in September 2017. It is about twins who grow up first in a small flat in post-Soviet Moscow and then in an asylum home in provincial West Germany and, at the same time, it is the story of a Jewish family over four generations. Salzmann was awarded the Jürgen Ponto Foundation Prize for Literature for her debut. The jury described "Beside Myself" as a ‘daring and accomplished balancing act between cultural and gender identity’ and ‘a multifaceted panorama of generations from the Soviet Union of the twentieth century to present-day Europe.’ The novel was also on the 2017 German Book Prize shortlist and in 2018 Salzmann won the Mara Cassens Prize for her ‘deeply provocative debut novel’. "Beside Myself" has been translated into fifteen languages.

Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis

The purpleback flying squid or purpleback squid ("Stenouteuthis oualaniensis") is a species of cephalopod in the family Ommastrephidae, occurring in the Indo-Pacific. It is considered one of the most abundant large squids.
Description.
"S. oualaniensis" are sexually dimorphic where the females tend to grow larger than the males in most cases. Dimorphism differentiation occurs in the sucker ring dentition in which different sizes occur which suggests that a feeding spectrum occurs among male and female individuals.
The species has a complex population structure, comprising three major and two minor forms with different morphology, anatomy, geographical distribution, and period of spawning. These forms include a giant form, a medium form with a double lateral axis on the gladius, a medium form with a single lateral axis on the gladius, a dwarf form, and a smaller earlier maturing form. The medium form is characterized by a dorsal photophore patch and fused mantel locking apparatus, it is the most common or “typical” form, and has the largest geographical distribution divide with a deeper vertical distribution when compared to the dwarf form. The dorsal mantel length (ML) of sexually mature adult males and females is 120 – 150 mm and 190 – 250 mm respectively. The smaller forms include a dwarf from an early maturing form, these two forms can be classified under the same category due to significant similarities as there is some disagreement in the literature. The smaller forms have no dorsal photophore patches and tend to reside in the equatorial waters (10 – 15 º N and S) of the Indonesian-Pacific Oceans, in which it spends the majority of its life in the upper mixed layers. The ML in the adult's males and females is 90 – 100 mm and 90 – 120 mm respectively. The giant forms are categorized by a dorsal photophore with a single lateral axis on the gladius and fused locking apparatus its distribution includes the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden northward of approximate 12 º N, to our knowledge a few mature adult females were recorded in the equatorial region of having an ML of 725 and 820 mm, whereas in the Arabian Sea an adult female had an ML of 300 – 500 mm. The different size forms can be explained by phenotypic plasticity due to environmental conditions.
Distribution and habitat.
The species occurs in a diverse range of environments in the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific, at depths from the surface to more than deep. Total species biomass has been estimated at between 8 – 11 million tonnes; the Arabian Sea from November to January is thought to have one of the highest concentrations (12 to 42 t km−2) due to population dynamics.
Feeding habits.
Purpleback flying squids, which are thought to be both predators and prey, they are considered to be both because throughout their life they are constantly changing with continuous body size increases making them fulfill different trophic levels on the taxonomic and ecological spectrum in consideration of their food organisms, enemies, and parasites. They feed utilizing a beak which is a hard structure that contains composites of proteins and chitin fibres. Beaks are an important morphological characteristic as they can be used to identify and classify a species since they are easy to see with the naked eye and do not break down in the stomachs of predators. This feeding organ tears up and bites food, throughout the squid's life the characteristics of a beak can change due to ontogenetic states. The wing of the beak undergoes pigmentation in which is related to the stiffness or hardness of the beak, the more tanned regions are harder than the untanned regions, this pigmentation of the beak is directly linked with growth and changes in the diet.
Purpleback flying squids are highly active predators as they can move through the water at high speeds, easily manoeuvre and respond swiftly to changes in their environment. When they are under distress of external factors such as predation they can reach a high speed and glide above the surface over ten meters, the cruising speed of an adult squid is between 3 to 10 km per hour, whereas their burst speed achieves greater speeds of up 35 km per hour, burst speed can be important for sudden changes in movement and escape behaviour. They can exist into shoals from 2 individuals to 800 individuals, and in some cases where geographical distributions overlap they can exist with similar-sized schools of "Dosidicus gigas" and "Ommastrephes bartramii".
The diet of purpleback flying squids is dependent on the size of their mantle length, in young squids or paralarva they tend to feed on predominately on micro- and mesozooplankton which include copepods and amphipods and many others. Juveniles or post-paralarvae can feed on meso- and macroplanktonic invertebrates, which include mainly copepods, euphausiids, amphipods, and chaetognaths as well as micronekton fishes (mainly myctophids) and squids, their mantel length cane range between 10 to 80 mm. As they get larger and increase in size their preference shifts towards larger fishes and squids and even other purpleback flying squids, as cannibalism is fairly common in this species.
Predators.
Purpleback flying squids are predated upon by many types of species as this occurs throughout their life as they increase in size and get larger. Paralarvae and juveniles tend to get eaten by larger animals that include chaetognaths, jellyfishes, small squids, planktivorous, and small carnivores teleosts. Juveniles that have a mantle length of 3 to 12 mm are preyed on by large squids of the Humboldt squid "Dosidicus gigas", dolphinfishes "Coryphaena hippurus", "C. equisetis", the snake mackerel "Gempylus serpens", the lancet fish "Alepisaurus ferox" and many species of tuna. Many species of sea birds also predate on juvenile and smaller squids in which occur mostly in the oceanic regional islands. The predators of the medium to large-sized purpleback squids include swordfishes "Xiphias gladis", striped marlins "Tetrapterus audax", many species of different sharks, for instance, the blue shark "Prionace glauca", the dusky shark "Carcharhinus obscurus", the oceanic whitetip shark "Carcharhinus logimanus", the silky shark "Carcharhinus falciformis", the smooth hammerhead shark "Sphyrna zyganea", the sperm whale "Physeter macrocephalus", and the Galapagos fur seal "Arctocephalus galapagoensis."
Reproduction.
Purpleback squids are thought to have a life span of up to 1 year, however in much larger squids the life span in unknown. The spawning strategy of these squids is an oceanic type which is a similar characteristic across the subfamily Ommastrephinae. S. "oualaniensis" is a monocyclic r-strategist, the potential fecundity is dependent on the form type of the squid which can range from 0.3 to 22 million.
There are no pre-mating rituals as the overall mating system of purpleback squids tends to be polygynous to polyandrous. Mating tends to occur in the surface waters at night where the squids mate in the “male-parallel” or the “head to head” positions to increase the likelihood of successful mating. The overall duration of mating is short as it can last up to 2 minutes, successful copulation's can produce up to 150 spermatangia which are then attached to the buccal cone and the membrane of the females. Specific to this species is the spawning periods that take place year around where the length of the season can last up to 3 months for female individuals. The peak season is also dependent on the form type of the squid, spawning takes place near the epipelagic zone at night, while spawning occurs in intervals (up to 10 cycles) rather than continuous time, where multiple batches can occur within one spawning period.
After spawning is completed the large, pelagic, gelatinous, egg masses will float to the surface above the upper pycnocline layer, the females will remain to feed and grow while the remaining oocytes are matured and the next spawning interval is ready. The duration of embryonic development is dependent on water temperature. For example, if development occurs at a water temperature of 25 °C it takes approximately 3 to 6 days. The egg size can range from 0.75 to 0.9 mm, whereas the hatchling size is approximately 1.0 mm mantle length.
Purpleback squids are known to be one of the fastest-growing squid species as the daily increase of overall length in the dwarf and middle-sized forms are about 1.0 mm, whereas, the giant form is about 3.8 mm.
Once embryonic development is completed is it characterized by a paralarvae stage which is unique to octopuses and squids, paralarva is also known as the rhynchoteuthion stage which is identified by the tentacles fusing to form a trunk-like proboscis which have a few suckers on the distal tip. When this stage is completed it is signified by a separation of approximately 7.0 to 8.0 mm in mantle length.

Corraclassy

Corraclassy () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Corraclassy is bounded on the north by Drumbeagh townland, on the west by Tullandreen townland, on the south by Gubnagree and Corranierna (Corlough) townlands and on the east by Garvary (Corlough) and Curraghabweehan townlands. Its chief geographical features are the Owensallagh river (A source of the River Blackwater, County Cavan) and dug wells. Corraclassy is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 56 statute acres.
History.
In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land.
A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Curraghclassy". In the 19th century the landlord was Lord John Beresford, the Protestant Archbishop of Armagh. The muddled land history of the area prior to this is described in the 1838 Exchequer case, "Attorney General of Ireland v The Lord Primate". 
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1826 list one tithepayer in the townland.
The Ordnance Survey Name Books for 1836 give the following description of the townland- "The soil is of a boggy light nature...a corn mill and kiln".
The Corraclassy Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 21, being 12 males and 9 females. There were three houses in the townland, all of which were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 14, being 6 males and 8 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were twelve houses in the townland, all inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists two landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 14, being 5 males and 9 females. There were two houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are three families listed in the townland.
In the 1911 census of Ireland, there are two families listed in the townland.

Henrietta Bingham

Henrietta Bingham (January 3, 1901 – June 17, 1968) was a wealthy American journalist, newspaper executive and horse breeder. When she was twelve, she was present when her mother was killed in a road accident which traumatized the whole family. She subsequently developed a very close relationship with her father who took a long time to recognize her lesbianism although eventually he became reconciled to her sexuality. In the 1920s she became an anglophile flapper and she associated with the Bloomsbury Group. In 1935 she purchased and ran a Kentucky estate for breeding thoroughbred racehorses. Her 1954 marriage, after a succession of partners, men and women, was unsuccessful.
Early life.
Henrietta Worth Bingham was born in Louisville, Kentucky on January 3, 1901 to Robert Worth Bingham (1871–1937), a lawyer who was an aspiring politician, and Eleanor "Babes" Miller (1870–1913) who had married in 1896. Her father's family had become prosperous in textiles and her mother came from a family that had become very wealthy in the engineering industry. Henrietta had two brothers: Robert Worth Bingham (1897–1965) and George Barry Bingham (1906–1988). As a child she was strong, competitive and good at many sports, particularly tennis. When she was twelve, Henrietta's mother was killed in a road accident at a level crossing. Henrietta and Barry, her younger brother, were present in the car at the time, and the whole family was traumatized.
Henrietta Bingham was attractive and charismatic, and as she passed through her adolescence, she took advantage of this, flirting with boys, and noticeably to many people, her father. She became her father's favorite over her brothers and he petted and spoiled her. In 1916, her father married Mary Lily Kenan Flagler, reputed to be "the wealthiest woman in the United States", having inherited $100 million when her elderly first husband Henry Flagler died. After less than one year of marriage on July 27, 1917 Mary Lily died, aged fifty. It was kept secret that she had died through alcohol and morphine addiction. When her will was contested, the court case revealed that she and her stepchildren had got on extremely badly, and the newspapers encouraged the suspicion that Henrietta and her brothers were somehow to do with her death, and that their father might be a murderer. In 1911 he had been appointed as a judge on the circuit court and in 1918 with the money he inherited, the Judge (as he came to be called always) purchased two Louisville newspapers – the "Courier-Journal" and "The Louisville Times". Henrietta developed a love of jazz and took up playing the saxophone – the Judge tolerated this against the mores of their society. She did well at school and in 1920 she became the first member of her family to enter an elite university: Smith College.
At Smith, the women's liberal arts college, new entrants were required to pass further exams to be allowed to continue into the next calendar year. Henrietta struggled and was persuaded to try again for re-entry in 1921. She formed a friendship with her English composition instructor, Mina Kirstein (sister of Lincoln Kirstein) and they became so close as to declare their love for each other. When her readmission had been confirmed Henrietta, with her father and younger brother, went on their annual visit to Britain at the same time as Kirstein who was visiting Harold Laski and his wife. With Kirstein, the Binghams mingled with modernist society in Britain. When Henrietta restarted her freshman year at Smith she again got into difficulty, not only academically but also by not keeping to the college's regulations. In 1922, now a full-fledged flapper with cropped hair and a poor reputation, she was asked to leave the college.
Europe.
Psychoanalysis.
To hide from her father that she could not continue her education, Bingham pretended that the college was allowing her time away to study in Europe and Kirstein contrived to be granted study leave in Europe at the same time. The Bingham family travelled to England separately from Kirstein but, when it was time for the rest of the Binghams to return home, Henrietta persuaded her father to let her stay on with Kirstein as chaperone. The two women, besotted with each other, set off on a grand tour of continental Europe.
Kirstein did not see a future for them as fully sexual lovers and from Carcassonne she wrote a twelve-page letter to Ernest Jones – the leading Freudian psychoanalyst in Britain at a time when psychoanalysis was generally regarded as dangerously aberrant. Her letter asked for help for an attractive 21-year-old American woman with irrational fears and a "homosexual tendency" possibly due to her childhood experiences. Bingham, she wrote, had developed an attraction towards Kirstein herself. She said that neither of them was ashamed of their relationship but they wanted to move on to another stage in their lives – "I am not a homosexual, though I love her very much". Bingham reluctantly agreed to psychoanalysis in London and refused to return to America even when her father asked for her urgently. When the Judge traveled to England at the end of 1922 he visited Jones and was satisfied that Henrietta's anxiety was being treated properly.
Bloomsbury.
Kirstein and Bingham enjoyed the bohemian nightlife in London and through David Garnett they made contact with the Bloomsbury Group. To allow them to stay in Britain Garnett suggested the couple might rent Tidmarsh Mill, the home of Lytton Strachey, Dora Carrington and her then husband Ralph Partridge, while the owners were going to be away for the summer. When they arrived to view the property Carrington found Kirstein lovely, with a perfect slim figure, and Bingham was "my style, pink with a round face, dressed in mannish clothes, with a good natural style". Carrington was disappointed when they left, but they had seemed to pay little attention to her. Anyway, Strachey refused their offer to rent the mill – he could not face having them living in the house. Back in London they met Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes and Duncan Grant. Although not an intellectual Bingham was in her element – her exoticism and sensuality enraptured the Bloomsberries – and was in the vanguard of bringing the Harlem Renaissance to Britain by playing the saxophone and singing spirituals and songs of the American South in her dusky voice. Carrington wrote she "almost made love to her in public" and then found from Garnett that Bingham had been continually asking after her and wanting to see her again.
In his continuing therapy sessions Jones, with Kirstein's agreement, had been encouraging Bingham to take a male partner. She had already caught the eye of Stephen Tomlin who was charismatic, widely read, and an accomplished writer and sculptor. They became lovers but she also turned to other partners from time to time. Both she and Tomlin had partners of both sexes.
Return to Kentucky.
Back in Kentucky, Bingham was unsettled, partly because she was disapproved of there. Her contemporaries knew she was "crazy about girls" though her father had not yet realized. He gave her the job of book editor in the local "Courier-Journal" he owned. With her brother Barry, she took the initiative of opening a book store, which only stocked literary books – those that Garnet sent in crates from his book store in London. Tomlin flooded her with letters asking her to return to Britain and, via Garnet, she asked if he would marry her. Tomlin wrote back equivocally because he wanted her as a lover but not as a wife. Bingham had thought marriage would sort out all the misunderstandings she was having with the other people close to her. However, she still visited Kirstein and they again expressed their love for each other.
Early in 1924 there was a serious crisis in the Bingham household. The result was that Bingham and her father became much more distant and he broke off all contact with Kirstein. The likeliest explanation was that someone had told her father about her lesbian relationship with Kirstein.
1924 in England.
In June 1924 the Binghams returned in England and Henrietta again become strongly involved with Bloomsbury social life. When Tomlin took her to Tidmarsh Mill she provocatively started to initiate an affair with Carrington. Kirstein was due to arrive in Britain and on the day before (and the day after her father had departed) Henrietta spent the whole afternoon with Carrington which, Carrington said, "no one knew of but us" referring to "ecstasy ... and no feelings of shame afterwards". Henrietta was her first and only female lover although Carrington found many women attractive to the point of having feelings of love or lust for them. Carrington wrote to her close friend Gerald Brenan, that she "killed my desires for "les jeunes garçons" pretty completely". While Bingham and Tomlin remained a couple, on one occasion she spent the night with Carrington 
at the ménage à trois' new house Ham Spray. In due course, Carrington wrote to Brenan "of certain sensations and wish to God [she] was here so I could repeat them".
Henrietta's family arrived to take a holiday in Scotland and while on the grouse moors her father told her they would be returning early to London for him to get married for the third time, to Aleen Hilliard (née Muldoon) – Henrietta vomited for five hours on hearing the news. Back in London, Dr. Jones wrote to his wife "General frightful crises with Binghamesque scenes" – she irrationally thought her father's marriage was to punish her. Carrington, Tomlin and Kirstein were all in despair over being repeatedly attracted and rejected by Bingham. After Kirstein and Bingham had returned to America Kirstein fell in love with Harry Curtiss, a dashing and successful businessman, who she described as "a very male Henrietta", and they married in 1926 after his divorce. Kirstein and Bingham remained lifetime friends. For Christmas Henrietta departed to the French Riviera with two girlfriends where she was photographed out walking in men's clothes, arm in arm with her two partners.
Main partners.
John Houseman.
After returning to America, Henrietta disliked living in Kentucky so she moved to a newly built apartment at 25 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan where she started working for the monthly magazine "Theatre Arts" to increase its advertising receipts and circulation. She was rapidly accepted into New York society and her apartment became a gathering place particularly for Southerners, both black and white. When she met John Houseman she swept him off his feet and, as he later reflected, it was the first and only time he "was ever really in love". He was invited back to her family home for Christmas and by the new year they were secretly engaged – their relationship was intense, romantic and unconsummated. 1926 was spent mostly on the moors of Scotland and in London where she formed a loving relationship with Alix Strachey. After a separation of over a year Houseman joined her in England where they consummated their relationship and let it be known they would marry and would go to live in America. Even on the voyage back they seriously quarrelled and by the summer of 1927 the relationship was over.
Beatrix Lehmann.
Bingham's relationship with Houseman having ended, Kirstein and Jones encouraged her to find another heterosexual male partner; however, she was being deluged with letters from Beatrix Lehmann, an actress she had met in Britain and who she had invited to join the Bingham family's 1927 holiday in Scotland where they had been "more than just friends". When her family returned home Henrietta stayed with Beatrix at the home of Rosamond Lehmann, Beatrix's sister, and wrote syndicated articles for U.S. newspapers about the English social scene, later turning to more serious topics such as the treatment of prisoners in European countries. By the end of the 1920s her father had come to realize, and even tolerate, her sexuality provided that, when in Kentucky, she wore a skirt.
On the spur of the moment in 1930, Henrietta bought a Bentley Speed Six Mulliner drophead coupé and she and Beatrix set off on a tour of Europe going via Stockholm to Berlin, Munich and Paris, enjoying the Roaring Twenties night life. In 1932 she joined the Judge in actively and financially supporting Franklin D. Roosevelt's campaign for the presidency, leading to her father's appointment next year to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom. She accompanied her father and her stepmother to London where she easily socialized with the younger aristocracy.
Helen Jacobs.
In 1934, the embassy held a reception for the U.S. Wightman Cup team. As a girl, Henrietta had been good at tennis and had won many trophies so she knew of Helen Jacobs, the leading member of the U.S. team who was daring enough to wear shorts on court. Henrietta set about attracting Jacobs and went to all her matches. The U.S team won easily but at the Wimbledon Championships Ladies' Singles Jacobs lost in the final to Dorothy Round, and then, according to the press, "rested ... with Miss Bingham ... at her [weekend] home in Sunningdale". After winning the 1934 U.S. Open, Jacobs sailed to Britain with Henrietta and stayed with her until she could rent her own apartment where she started writing a novel.
The two women spent the winter together with Jacobs taking up foxhunting, already a passion of Bingham's and becoming enraptured with her partner. On an occasion while the ambassador and his wife were away, Henrietta threw a party at the family residence – the Prince of Wales and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. were there – Jacobs wrote that it was a glorious success. Jacobs effectively became part of the Bingham household and she formed a good mutual friendship with Henrietta's father.
In 1935 the two women went to live together near Louisville while the ambassador and his wife stayed in London. Henrietta purchased a magnificent 450-acre country estate, called Harmony Landing, at Goshen intending to use it for breeding thoroughbred horses and pedigree dogs. By 1936 there was strong anti-Nazi feeling in Britain (and particularly in the Bingham family) so when Jacobs won her Wimbledon singles final against the German Hilde Sperling there was, according to the "New York Times", "probably the most wholehearted ovation Wimbledon will ever know". Jacobs and Bingham were photographed together and were reported as being "almost inseparable". Robert Bingham resigned his ambassadorship shortly before his death in December 1937 but at his funeral in Kentucky the two women felt they had to stand away from each other because anti-homosexual attitudes were strengthening in America at this time.
Later life.
The death of the Judge took its toll on Henrietta and, unable to socialize freely, she and Helen concentrated on thoroughbred horse breeding. Her father's will left her what was, for her, a rather low income but her younger brother Barry Bingham helped by appointing her treasurer of the Louisville "Courier-Journal" that he now owned. When Jacobs returned to Europe for the 1938 tennis season Bingham had to stay behind to manage the estate and that winter Jacobs could not stay at Goshen for prolonged periods because of the social ostracism. Bingham started drinking more heavily and their relationship was drifting apart.
The horse breeding business was reasonably successful but Bingham suffered a nervous breakdown and afterwards she required periodic hospitalization and nursing care at home. She was advised to undergo electroconvulsive therapy and frontal lobotomy to counter her depression and erratic behavior but she refused these treatments.
In 1950 she sold her Goshen estate and moved to Manhattan where she found a new, and older, partner Dorothie Bigelow, a singer and actress. In 1954, she married Benjamin Franklin McKenzie, younger than her by ten years – he seemingly was a waiter at a nightclub and had been married twice before. The partnership only lasted a few months until McKenzie deserted her,
going to live in Florida. She visited England, meeting Garnett, Jones and a few other old friends. In 1956, she took an overdose, and when she was taken to hospital, her rooms were found to contain a mass of different drugs, prescribed by a variety of doctors. Bingham lived until 1968 with a paid nurse to look after her.
She died on June 17, 1968 and was buried beside her father at Cave Hill Cemetery, Louisville.

Pakodanomics

Pakodanomics refers to the economic policies instituted in India to encourage self employment and entrepreneurship. This expression originated during an exclusive interview by Zee Media of the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, with regards to answering the queries in relation to game changing economic reforms. Since then, this particular utterance has made its rounds within the Indian subcontinent and has received blazing criticism from the members of the Opposition members as well as economic commentators.
The term 'Pakodanomics' has been coined by columnist Vivek Kaul, who also prefers the term "bondanomics." 
History.
The term originated from a comment made by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi in January 2018 stating that street food vendors (selling pakodas) should also be considered in employment statistics and hence unemployment in the country is actually much lower than statistically reported.
One of the main concerns of the Indian economy during the BJP government has been increasing employment opportunities for the huge number of youth entering the work force. It is estimated that over one million new people join the work force every month in India while the economy added approximately half a million formal jobs in the whole of the previous year.
Pakodanomics was also a result of demonetization which was the sudden banning of 86% of currency in India in November 2016 that led to major economic upheaval.
Pakodanomics also became a light-hearted reference to the economic policies of the government and there were many comedic references at campaign rallies and on television. Commentators seriously tried to dissect the government's policies and realized that in fact that the policies of the government were not generating enough formal employment.

William Strudwick Arrasmith

William Strudwick Arrasmith (July 15, 1898 – November 30, 1965) was an American architect known for his designs for Greyhound bus stations in the Streamline Moderne style popular in the 1930s and 1940s. Among the over 60 stations he designed are the Cleveland Greyhound Bus Station (1948), the Montgomery, Alabama, Greyhound Bus Station (1951), and the Evansville, Indiana, Greyhound Bus Terminal (1938) which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Early life and family.
William Arrasmith was born on July 15, 1898, to Thomas and Mary Strudwick at Hillsboro, North Carolina, in the United States. He studied at the University of North Carolina and graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign with a bachelor of science degree in architecture in 1921.
He met his future wife, Elizabeth "Betty" Beam, at Illinois. They had a daughter, Anne.
Career.
Arrasmith moved to Louisville, Kentucky, in 1922 where he worked with Fred Morgan, E.T. Hutchings, and Brinton Davis. In 1929 he went into partnership with Herman Wischmeyer as "Wischmeyer, Arrasmith, and Elswick". The firm's notable buildings included the Federal Land Bank and the Louisville Scottish Rite Temple (on which Arrasmith is not credited). He was later in partnership with Bill Tyler as Arrasmith &amp; Tyler which later became "Arrasmith &amp; Judd" and then "Arrasmith, Judd, Rapp &amp; Associates". As of 2015 the firm was trading as "Arrasmith, Judd, Rapp, Chovan, Inc."
He was known for his designs for Greyhound bus stations in the Streamline Moderne style that was popular in the 1930s and 40s. His first design for the company was a terminal in Louisville that opened in 1937. He also designed stations for the company in Columbus, Dayton, Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. Among the prime examples of his work is the Cleveland Greyhound Bus Station (1948) which is on the National Register of Historic Places along with eight of his other station designs. In total he designed over 60 stations for the company.
Other work by Arrasmith in the Louisville region included the "Methodist Evangelical Hospital", the Police School, the science building and medical apartments for the University of Louisville, the 800 Apartments Building, Kentucky Fairgrounds, Kentucky Hotel, Byck's Department Store (St. Matthews and 4th Street), Kentucky State Reformatory (1939), and buildings for Western Kentucky University.
Military service.
Arrasmith was in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps while at Illinois and was in command of a veteran company in 1933. Following the Ohio River flood of 1937 he led efforts to build a pontoon bridge to link Louisville's downtown to the East End. During the Second World War he served with the United States Army 6th Corps Engineers in Europe and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the army reserves.
Death and legacy.
Arrasmith died on November 30, 1965, in Louisville, Kentucky. A collection of his papers is held by The Filson Historical Society. A book by Frank E. Wrenick devoted to Arrasmith's Greyhound designs was published by McFarland in 2006.

Love per Square Foot

Love Per Square Foot is a 2018 Indian Hindi-language romantic comedy film directed by Anand Tiwari and produced by Ronnie Screwvala, under his newly established banner RSVP Movies. The film stars Vicky Kaushal and Angira Dhar in the lead roles, which is about Sanjay and Karina who try to find a house in Mumbai, does not have enough money to earn individually, in order to buy a home, so they enter into a marriage of convenience.
Anand Tiwari who wrote the script in 2010, along with Sumeet Vyas, was intended to be made into a dark film, later they chose to make it as a romantic comedy film. The shooting of the film took place across Mumbai, within 50 days, during December 2016 and January 2017, whereas post-production works were completed within three months. Anand Bajpai composed the background score, whereas Sohail Sen composed the film's soundtrack. The film's cinematography was handled by Avinash Arun and editing done by Sanyukta Kaza.
Originally scheduled for a theatrical release, Anand Tiwari eventually sent the film's final cut to the executives of Netflix India, who approved to release the film online. Thus it became the first Indian film to be released directly on a streaming platform. Billed as the first Indian original film from Netflix, "Love Per Square Foot" released directly through the streaming platform on 14 February 2018, to coincide with the Valentine's Day. The film was screened at the Beijing International Film Festival, held in China on April 2019.
Plot.
The film revolves around Sanjay Kumar Chaturvedi, an IT engineer, and Karina D'souza. They both work in the same bank and dream of having their own home but are held back because of problems in their personal lives. Sanjay's boss, Rashi Khurana is having an extra-marital affair with him, but refuses to leave her husband, Kashin, while Karina is betrothed to Samuel and constantly held back from her dream of owning a home, by her mother Blossom. Everything changes when Sanjay finds out about a joint housing scheme, and asks Karina to apply for the scheme with him. She agrees and the movie portrays various problems they have as they are trying to buy the apartment as an unmarried couple.
Production.
Development.
During the shooting of "Aisha" (2010) in Mumbai, Anand Tiwari witnessed a couple fighting in the middle of Carter Road in Mumbai, with he was heading to Bandra in a local train, where the same couple boarded the train and the fight continued in the train and they passionately hugged after that. He eventually stated as "the journey of love between Bandra and Mumbai Central" in an interview later, further adding that: "I always wanted to show relationships as they happen, as opposed to how they are shown in films".
Anand wrote the script in late 2010, as a dark film initially, with Vikramaditya Motwane, stating that the script is too dark, and it need to make the character likeable. He then discussed with his friends Manav Kaul and Sumeet Vyas, and decided to make it as a romantic comedy film. While shooting for "Finding Fanny", he and Sumeet went for a short trip to Goa for 10 days, were Anand wrote the first draft of the film. He narrated the script to producer Ronnie Screwvala, at his office, whom eventually accepted to produce the film, after liking the script. The film marked Screwvala's return to production after three years. Screwvala, the founder of UTV Motion Pictures, left the company in 2014, after Disney India announced its collaboration. It eventually marked its solo production under his banner RSVP Movies.
Casting.
Initially, Anand wanted Sumeet Vyas to play the role of the protagonist Sanjay Chaturvedi; but the actor changed his mind, and insisted Vicky Kaushal, whom personally worked with Anand and Sumeet in theatre workshops. The film's casting director Honey Trehan suggested Kaushal's name for the script. After being cast in the role, Kaushal stated at the 18th IIFA Awards in Mumbai that "It’s a romantic story mixed with a comedy about a boy and girl trying to find a house in Mumbai. I have never been a part of a happy film. All my earlier films have been on the intense side, so I had a ball shooting for this one. My character Sanjay is ambitious and street-smart. This film will be a proper commercial Hindi film with a lot of dancing and singing incorporated in it". Angira Dhar was hired to play the female lead, in his second collaboration with Anand after "Bang Baaja Baarat". Alankrita Sahai plays the role of Sanjay’s intimidating boss, Rashi, whereas Ratna Pathak Shah, Supriya Pathak and Raghubir Yadav, essayed the role of Karina and Sanjay’s parents. Ranbir Kapoor made a cameo appearance in the film.
Filming.
Principal photography began in December 2016, with the film being mostly shot around Mumbai, and ended in January 2017. The entire film was shot within a duration of 50 days, including the songs, sequences and the patchwork. During the post-production process, Tiwari took about one-and-a-half months for the first cut and visual effects, with the rest of the dubbing, editing, and sound mixing lasted for two months, by which, the process was completed within three to four months.
Soundtrack.
The film's soundtrack album is composed and produced by Sohail Sen, with lyrics for the songs were written by Abhishek Dhusia, Sahir Nawab, Sumeet Suvarna, Anand Tiwari, Gopal Datt, Abhiruchi Chand, and Jamil. The soundtrack features vocals by Benny Dayal, Shivangi Bhayana, Udit Narayan, Rekha Bhardwaj, Altamash Faridi, Abhishek Dhusia, Tarannum Malik, Sahir Nawab, and Sumeet Suvarna. Bhardwaj, also made an appearance in the film, as a classical singer, apart from singing the song "Raaz Apne Dil Ke", which has two versions. The soundtrack album features seven tracks and was released by Zee Music Company on 24 January 2018.
Music critics Jay Palav and Anish Mohanty reviewed about the use of jazz, beatbox, classical, western and orchestral arrangements, and instrumentation in the soundtrack. Palav, praised the use of veteran singers, Udit Narayan, Altamash Faridi and Tarannum Malik, in the soundtrack, adding a verdict: "Sohail’s put up a winning OST, which is relatable, warm and accessible". Mohanty, added the final word "After composing for "Happy Bhag Jayegi" (2016), he makes a good enough comeback to the film music scene with this film, and one looks forward to see the kind of music he rolls out with his upcoming releases".
Release.
Initially scheduled for a theatrical release on 8 September 2017, "Love Per Square Foot" was pushed to 20 April 2018, due to post-production delays. Anand Tiwari later presented the final cut of the film, to the executives of Netflix headquarters in India, with eventually picking it for a release in their platforms. On November 2017, Netflix officially announced the release on its platform, with "Love Per Square Foot" becoming the first mainstream production from India to be made available on the streaming site.
"Love Per Square Foot" was preponed from its original scheduled date (20 April 2018), to 14 February 2018, in order to coincide the Valentine's Day. The film's official trailer was premiered on 18 January 2018. It was released as the first Netflix Indian original film in more than 190 countries on 14 February. The film was showcased at Beijing International Film Festival in 26 April 2019.
Reception.
Rohit Vats of "Hindustan Times" gave 3 out of 5 and stated "Love Per Square Foot doesn’t delve deep into matters of the heart, but it’s a feel good film for sure. Angira Dhar makes a promising debut and Vicky Kaushal shows his lighter side. Anand Tiwari handles romance with proper care and maturity. Love Per Square Foot is youthful, urbane and lovable." Ektaa Malik of "The Indian Express" wrote: "The film has its heart in the right place and would have worked better had it been about twenty minutes shorter." Kriti Tulsiani of "News18" wrote "If the name "Love Per Square Foot" isn't enough to bring a smile to your face, just sit back and relish the conundrums of love and space in the city of Mumbai." Swetha Ramakrishnan of "Firstpost" gave 3.5 out of 5 stating "Love Per Square Foot is what happens when you have an authentic setting, a stellar cast, the right intentions and good writing all mixed into one film."
Dipti Kahrude of "The Quint" wrote "In popular culture, millennial lives are almost synonymous with galloping digitization. "Love Per Square Foot" instead directs its gaze on the middle class realities and aspirations of millennials living with their parents in cramped houses, with no privacy of bedrooms of their own. It bracingly avoids defining them merely by technology. The film may not break thrilling new ground with its subject but the observational humour in the dialogue, the bevy of supporting characters, earnest performances and an assured directorial debut make it worth a watch." Rajat Tripathi of "Bollywood Life" gave 3.5 out of 5 and wrote "If you are a love bug, Love Per Square Foot will certainly tug at your heartstrings and make you feel giddy. It is the perfect romantic film that we were waiting for. It is the cutest film that has released in the longest time. However, if you are not a sucker for romance, you might want to avoid it."
Rahul Desai of "Film Companion" gave 3 out of 5 and stated "The film merely uses “space” as a generic trigger to communicate the city’s diverse stereotypes." Deepali Singh of "Daily News and Analysis" gave 2.5 out of 5 and stated "The plot takes a predictable turn towards the end when you know that all’s going to end well after all." Malika Bhagat of "The Times of India" gave 3 out of 5 stating "The fact that the end panders to the typical romantic in us is why "Love Per Square Foot" fails to live up to the hype." Avinash Ramachandiran of "The New Indian Express" wrote "Love Per Square Foot falls in the space of those bitter-sweet dramas about the housing space that we saw in the 1970s."

This Time with Alan Partridge

This Time with Alan Partridge is a British television comedy which began in 2019 and is broadcast on BBC One. It stars Steve Coogan as the inept broadcaster Alan Partridge in a spoof of current affairs programmes such as "The One Show" and "Good Morning Britain".
After a series of productions with Sky, "This Time" was the first BBC Alan Partridge production since "I'm Alan Partridge" ended in 2002"." Susannah Fielding plays Partridge's co-host Jennie, and Tim Key and Felicity Montagu reprise their roles as Simon Denton and Partridge's assistant Lynn Benfield. The series received generally favourable reviews. The second series was broadcast in 2021.
Premise.
Alan Partridge, played by Steve Coogan, becomes the stand-in presenter of "This Time" after the regular co-host falls ill. According to "The Guardian", the show features "Partridgean tirades on everything from hand hygiene (leading him to lurk outside the BBC toilets doing spot-checks on colleagues) to hacking".
Production.
Partridge, an inept broadcaster, was created in 1991 by Coogan and Armando Iannucci. Following early Partridge shows such as "Knowing Me, Knowing You" and "I'm Alan Partridge," produced by the BBC, "This Time" was the first BBC Partridge project following several Sky productions. It was produced by Coogan's production company Baby Cow Productions, written by Coogan and the Gibbons brothers, directed by the Gibbons brothers, and produced by Ted Dowd.
Coogan felt it was the right time for Partridge to return, and that he might represent the views of Brexit voters. Neil Gibbons said the world of live television presenting had changed since Partridge had been created: "If someone fluffed a line or got someone’s name wrong or said something stupid, it was mortifying. But nowadays, those are the sort of people who are given jobs on TV." He likened Partridge to presenters such as Piers Morgan, who he felt had been hired to present "Good Morning Britain" because he said offensive things. Coogan and the Gibbonses ignored this because "if you put Alan in a world where his crass buffoonery is part of the selling point, there's nowhere for him to fall".
A second series was produced in 2020, and began on BBC One on 30 April 2021.
Reception.
"This Time with Alan Partridge" has received mostly positive reviews. Lucy Mangan of "The Guardian" wrote that "the differentiation of "This Time With Alan Partridge"s layers and escalation of every exchange is precision-engineered: beautiful things and a joy forever." Tim Glanfield of "Radio Times" felt it was "some of the best Alan Partridge ever made". Sean O'Grady of "The Independent" gave it five stars, and found it "a consistently strong creative achievement". The segment with Steve Coogan as Martin Brennan (the Irish Alan Partridge lookalike) was described by Raidió Teilifís Éireann as "TV moment of the year", which would be remembered "in the canon of truly great Partridge moments."
Hugo Rifkind of "The Times" was less positive, saying "Only very occasionally does it soar into unexpected places. Still, for a character that came along a quarter of a century ago and still isn't old, maybe fresh delights are a bit too much to ask." Writing for "Prospect", Lucinda Smyth argued ""This Time" is... OK. But it is not the best of British television, it's not even the best of Coogan, and it undermines both to say so... I don't mean to say that there haven't been a few gems in "This Time". But overall the timing is patchy, the belly-laughs are few, and the script is tiringly Alan-centric."
Television host Piers Morgan, who is spoofed by "This Time", said that Coogan was "trying to exact revenge on me because he now hates everything to do with newspapers... I used to love Alan Partridge, he used to be hilarious, brilliant. It is now utterly unwatchable. Because Coogan has disappeared up his derrière, unfortunately."

Archaeology Museum of Catalonia (Girona)

The Archaeology Museum of Catalonia in Girona (, MAC Girona) is one of the five venues of the Archaeology Museum of Catalonia, located in the Sant Pere de Galligants Benedictine abbey of Girona since its foundation in 1857. It contains materials found during archaeological excavations at various sites in the province of Girona, dating from prehistory to the Middle Ages.
The museum was founded as the Provincial Museum of Antiquities and Fine Arts in 1846 by the Provincial Monument Commission, and is therefore one of the oldest museums in Catalonia. Between 1846 and 1857 the Museum had several different locations, until Sant Pere de Galligants monastery in 1857, where it has remained until today, and where it was given the name by which it is popularly known.
Building.
The building where the Museum is located is a remarkable example of Catalan Romanesque architecture from the 12th century. Its foundation date is not known, but it existed already in the first half of the 10th century. In 1836 it was abandoned by the community of Benedictine monks who lived there, due to the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizábal. Today, the Museum occupies the cloister and the Romanesque church, as well as the area above the cloister, built in the second half of the 19th century. Since 1992 the Museum has been part of the Archaeology Museum of Catalonia, run by the Catalan Cultural Heritage Agency.

Hubbard's Hill

Hubbard's Hill is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest south of Sevenoaks in Kent. It is a Geological Conservation Review site.
This Quaternary site exhibits solifluction (erosion by freezing and thawing). The main deposits date to the Wolstonian glaciation around 130,000 years ago, but the latest have radiocarbon dates of only 12,500 years, during the most recent Younger Dryas ice age.
The Greensand Way long distance footpath goes through the site.

Windsor Court

Windsor Court is a large country house in, Englefield Green, Surrey, England. The mansion adjoins Windsor Great Park.
History.
The 37,000 sq ft house was built as Park Close between 1899-1901 in an eclectic mix of styles, most notably Arts &amp; Crafts. The main house has 10 bedrooms, 12 bathrooms and 6 reception rooms. The estate includes 25 acres of mature gardens, cottages, stables and a large dower house.
Park Close was owned in its early years by the civil engineer and politician Urban Hanlon Broughton as his summer residence. In 1930, his widow Mrs Urban H. Broughton was still living there and at 37 Grosvenor Square, London. In 1949, it was home to Norman Greenlees Weir.
In 2004, it was bought for £8 million, by "resolutely anonymous" owners, but they apparently never moved in or did any work on the house, except to rename it as Windsor Court.
In April 2016, it was listed for sale at £19.9 million, having been reduced from £25 million. As of June 2020 it is listed for sale at £15,999,950. According to "The New York Times", the house, which is in need of extensive and costly restoration work could be saved, but is "more likely to be knocked down and replaced".

130th Field Artillery Regiment

The 130th Field Artillery Regiment is a United States Army field artillery regiment, represented in the Kansas Army National Guard by the 2nd Battalion, 130th Field Artillery, part of the 130th Field Artillery Brigade at Hiawatha, Kansas.
The regiment was originally organized in 1917 after the United States entry into World War I as the 1st Field Artillery of the Kansas National Guard. Later that year, it mustered into Federal service and was reorganized as the 130th Field Artillery, fighting with the 35th Division in the American Expeditionary Forces in France. After the end of World War I the regiment returned home and was demobilized, briefly reverting to its state designation. In 1921 it became the 130th Field Artillery again and was assigned to the 35th Division. Inducted into Federal service on 23 December 1940 for eventual service in World War II, the regiment was broken up on 1 March 1942 into the 130th (the former 1st Battalion) and 154th (the former 2nd Battalion) Field Artillery Battalions, which were relieved from the 35th Division on 27 January and 12 January 1943, respectively . 
The 130th Field Artillery Battalion remained stateside until 2 December 1944, when it was sent to Europe, serving in Germany in the final months of the war. The 154th was sent to Alaska on temporary duty on 27 July 1942, fought in the Aleutian Islands Campaign, and after its official relief from the 35th Division was later deployed to the Pacific Theater. Postwar, both battalions returned to state service, with the 130th becoming the 130th Armored Field Artillery Battalion. In 1959 both battalions consolidated as the 130th Artillery under the Combat Arms Regimental System.

The Marquette West River is a tributary of the Marquette River, flowing into the unorganized territory of Lac-Ashuapmushuan, Quebec, in the Regional County Municipality (RCM) of Le Domaine-du-Roy, in the administrative region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in Quebec, in Canada.
The Marquette West River flows successively into the townships of Huard, Buade, Poutrincourt and Cramahé. The course of this river is located west of the Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second.
The forest road R0212 (East-West direction) intersects the middle section of the Marquette River West. The route 167 linking Chibougamau to Saint-Félicien, Quebec passes on the north-east side of the Normandin River and on the Northeast of Ashuapmushuan Lake.
The surface of the Marquette West River is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice movement is generally from mid-November to mid-April.
Toponymy.
This hydronym evokes the work of life of Jacques Marquette (Laon, France, 1637 - near Luddington, Michigan, 1675). He was a Jesuit missionary and explorer. He first studied Amerindian languages, then he devoted himself to various missions including the Outaouais; in 1671, he founded the mission of Saint-Ignace, among the Wendat (Hurons), on the north shore of Michilimakinac Strait. In 1672, he met Louis Jolliet with whom he would reach the Mississippi River. He will explore this river to the present border of Arkansas and Louisiana. Wanting to start a mission with the Kaskaskias in the land of Illinois, Father Marquette reluctantly relinquishes it because of illness.
The toponym "Rivière Marquette Ouest" was formalized on March 28, 1972, at the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

Sunfield G. A. R. Hall

The Sunfield G. A. R. Hall, also known as the Sunfield Grand Army of the Republic Post No. 283 Hall, is a hall built for the Grand Army of the Republic fraternal organization, located at 115 Main Street in Sunfield, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. The building has been in continuous use by organizations of Civil War veterans and their descendants since its construction.
History.
The Grand Army of the Republic was organized in 1866 as a fraternal organization for Union veterans of the |Civil War. Although a Michigan section was initially organized in 1867, it became inactive, and was reorganized in 1879. However, the organization quickly caught on in the state, with nearly 400 posts formed over the next 15 years. This included the Samuel W. Grinnell Post No. 283, chartered in Sunfield on October 6, 1884. The post was named after Sergeant Samuel W. Grinnell, who had died in 1883. Grinnell had seen action in the Battle of Shiloh, and later served as Sunfield's village clerk, treasurer and as a justice of the peace.
The post first met in a private home, then in a room above a local blacksmith shop, then later at the Sunfield Odd Fellows Hall. By 1898, the membership had grown to 32, and the post decided to construct their own hall. Land was purchased, and in 1899 work began constructing this building. The building was dedicated on September 15, 1899. Later that year, two cannon captured in the Spanish–American War were put in place. The building continued to be used by the post through the first three decades of the twentieth century. However, by 1929, only two members remained, and the last member died in 1934.
However, other organizations consisting of decedents of Civil War veterans have used and maintained the hall. Among these were the Women's Relief Corps #62, who used the building from 1899 to 1925 and the Samuel W. Grinnell Camp #17, Sons of Union Veterans, from 1918 to 1936. The Helen M. Edwins Tent #30, Daughters of Union Veterans of the Civil War, began using the hall in 1926, and (as of the 1980s) owned the property. the Curtenius Guard Camp #17, Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, began using the hall in 1983, and continue to meet there.
Description.
The Sunfield G. A. R. Hall is a rectangular, single story, front-gable, clapboarded building, with a false front topped by a pressed metal cornice. Atop the cornice is a plaque with the building's construction date, 1899, and the initials G. A. R. The building has a metal roof and fieldstone foundation. The front and side walls of the hall contain two-over-two windows in plain board frames. Two cannon sit in front of the building.
On the interior, the building is divided into three rooms: a small entry vestibule, the nearby cloakroom, and the main hall. A door with peephole separates the vestibule from the main hall. The main hall remains largely as furnished by the original members of the G. A. R. post, including members' chairs, weapons and medals and flags and other effects.

Krishi Vigyan Kendra

A Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) is an agricultural extension center in India. The name means "farm science center". Usually associated with a local agricultural university, these centers serve as the ultimate link between the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and farmers, and aim to apply agricultural research in a practical, localized setting. All KVKs fall under the jurisdiction of one of the 11 Agricultural Technology Application Research Institutes (ATARIs) throughout India.
As of May 2021, there are approximately 722 KVKs throughout India.
History.
The first KVK was established in 1974 in Pondicherry. Since then, KVKs have been established in all states, and the number continues to grow. The Indian agricultural landscape faces many challenges, including a high percentage of smallholder farmers, lack of supply chain infrastructure, and extreme weather conditions. For a full description of these challenges, see Agriculture in India. A key strategy in addressing these issues, in addition to policy support and a functioning market, is using technology to better understand and adapt to complex challenges. However, higher-level research about modern agricultural trends, such as Climate Change and GMO, takes place in universities. The practical implications of this research, or their relevance to a certain local context, are not readily apparent. For example, academic research on new crop practices or seed types often takes place in centralized testing locations, due to the ease of monitoring and evaluation. The same goes for ground-level innovations which are effective in one local context but may not be extensible to others. Especially in areas with such geographic complexity as India, agricultural extension departments such as KVKs serve to gather, test and disseminate knowledge between centralized institutions and a geographically-dispersed rural population.
In this mandate, the effectiveness of KVKs is difficult to measure, due to large number of farmers served by a single KVK and largely off-line communication between the KVK and farmers. For this reason, research over the past 20 years has focused on the capacity of KVKs to make use of ICT for the purpose of better managing their communications with farmers. An plethora of applications have been developed, sharing advisories such as weather information and market pricing, supplementing the KVK's communication with its beneficiaries. However, many of these initiatives are short-lasted, or have limited impact, since the teams at each KVK often do not have the capacity to maintain software applications or because farmers do not find the information useful.
While KVKs are expected to undertake their own projects, they are also expected to serve as a resource center for extending government initiatives to local areas. The current national government's program "Doubling Farmers' Income by 2022" calls for increases in agricultural productivity, development initiatives such as Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana as well as more focus on technological innovation. The government expects KVKs to aid in the dissemination of information and practices regarding these new government initiatives. In addition to KVKs, there are many local institutions which also interface directly with farmers, such as the Agricultural produce market committee and the Agricultural Engineering Department. As of October 2018, there is an online dashboard which provides updates on the activity of various KVKs. 
Criteria.
A KVK can be formed under a variety of host institutions, including agricultural universities, state departments, ICAR institutes, other educational institutions, or NGOs. The 700 KVKs in operation per the ICAR website are split into: 458 under State Agricultural Universities, 18 under Central Agricultural Universities, 64 under ICAR institutes, 105 under NGOs, 39 under state departments or other public sector undertakings, and 16 under other miscellaneous educational institutions. A KVK must own about 20 hectare of land for the purpose of testing new agricultural technologies.
Responsibilities.
On-Farm Testing: Each KVK operates a small farm to test new technologies, such as seed varieties or innovative farming methods, developed by ICAR institutes. This allows new technologies to be tested at the local level before being transferred to farmers.
Front-line Demonstration: Due to the KVK's farm and its proximity to nearby villages, it organizes programs to show the efficacy of new technologies on farmer fields.
Capacity Building: In addition to demonstrating new technologies, the KVK also hosts capacity building exercises and workshops to discuss modern farming techniques with groups of farmers.
Multi-sector Support: Offer support to various private and public initiatives through its local network and expertise. It is very common for government research institutes to leverage the network of KVKs when performing surveys with a wide range of farmers.
Advisory Services: Due to the growing use of ICT, KVKs have implemented technologies to provide farmers information, such as weather advisories or market pricing, through radio and mobile phones.
In each of these activities, the KVK focuses on crops and methods specific to the local climate and industry. Some factors which may impact this decision are: soil type, crops grown, water availability, seasonal temperatures, and allied sectors such as dairy and aquaculture. In addition to addressing local factors, KVKs are also mandated to increase adoption of practices that align with remunerative agriculture, climate smart agriculture, and dietary diversification. Some KVKs also host social activities to facilitate rapport between the institutions and the local community.

Camp Cawa-Cawa siege

The Camp Cawa-Cawa siege (Filipino: "Pagkubkob sa Kampo Cawa-Cawa", Chavacano: "Sitio de Campo Cawa-Cawa") was a siege of a Philippine Constabulary-Integrated National Police camp by security forces of the Philippines on January 3–5, 1989, after a rogue policeman took the camp's ranking officer hostage.
Rizal Alih, a patrolman, and several other men had been detained pending an investigation into their alleged involvement in the murder of Zamboanga City Mayor Cesar Climaco on 14 November 1984. Gen. Eduardo Batalla, the regional commander of the PC-INP who had his office at the camp, had made a decision to have the detained men transferred to Manila; however, Alih refused to cooperate. Batalla had summoned the men to his office for a conference, but the talks degenerated into a heated exchange with both parties shouting at each other. Alih and his companions were able to over-power their guards and took Batalla, his aide Col. Romeo Abendan and several others hostage.
After a 3-day siege, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Renato de Villa ordered that the camp be assaulted. Philippine security forces decided to attack the camp using helicopters. Rockets deployed from the aircraft set fire to the building where Gen. Batalla was being held and it burned to the ground. Batalla, Abendan and 18 other PC/INP personnel were later found burned to death. Alih managed to escape the ruined camp, making his way to Basilan and eventually Sabah, Malaysia.
Alih was arrested by Malaysian authorities on August 18, 1994 and charged with illegal possession of firearms. He was extradited back to the Philippines in 2006. He was detained in Camp Crame and died in the camp's hospital on 14 August 2015 after complaining of chest pains. He was buried the next day in Zamboanga City.
Commemoration.
The Philippine National Police commemorates the deaths of Gen. Batalla and Col. Abendan every year. Camp Cawa-Cawa itself was renamed Camp Brigadier General Eduardo B Batalla, and another Philippine National Police camp in Mercedes, Zamboanga City was named Camp Colonel Romeo A. Abendan in honor of the slain police officers.
In popular culture.
A film depicting the siege, "", was released on March 8, 1989. Directed by Carlo J. Caparas, it stars Ramon Revilla as Rizal Alih and Eddie Garcia as Brig. Gen. Eduardo Batalla.

Black stane

Black Stane or stone examinations are peculiar to the ancient universities of Scotland, in particular the University of St Andrews and University of Glasgow.
The black stanes date to the foundation of each university and were used for viva examinations with a set time, later recorded using a time glass to denote for how long the student would be expected to talk about the breadth and depth of his subject, normally in Latin.
The University of Glasgow black Stane exams lasted 20 minutes, the bedullus bearing the university mace turned the time glass and the exam began. When all of the sand ran out the bedullus shouted "fluxit" which is Latin for the sand "has flowed through". If the examiners were pleased the student passed the exam but if not, the timer was turned over and the student had to repeat the exam. Black stane exams lasted in Glasgow from the foundation in 1451 to the middle of the nineteenth century, though it is used for some exams.
The Glasgow black stane was enclosed in a wooden chair in 1775, with brass inlaid plates showing the arms of the University and the names of the founders, Pope Nicholas V, King James II of Scotland and Bishop Turnbull of Glasgow on the front of the chair. On the back are carved the Royal Arms of Scotland and the Royal Arms of England.
The St Andrews black stane was used from its foundation in 1410 and like Glasgow, until the middle of the nineteenth century. It was located in Old Parliament house, St Mary's college, from the late sixteenth century until the University Museum was founded in 2008. Students would be examined standing on the St Andrews black stane and the exam would last up to 60 minutes, according to the degree to be awarded.

Katzenberg Hillfort

Katzenberg Hillfort ( or "Römerwarte Mayen") is a Roman refuge fort near Mayen in Germany dating to the 4th century.
The fortification on the Katzenberg hill was built around 300 AD after the Roman "limes" had been overrun and Germanic tribes had invaded and plundered the Roman Empire (the so-called "Limesfall"). The inhabitants of the Roman "vicus", which was located on the site of the present-day town of Mayen, could escape to the fort in time of danger. At that time, town walls were built around the provincial capitals of Trier, Cologne and Mainz, as well as around smaller places like Koblenz or Andernach. The Katzenberg was the largest of about 60 Late Roman hillforts which were constructed in the Eifel and Hunsrück regions. They were used for about 70 years and then, after a 30-year pause, used again, in some cases until about 450 AD. On the uppermost crest of the hill is a small military outpost, the lower-lying open areas were probably used by the civilian population in the event of a threat. The fort covered an area of 1.2 hectares.
The remains of the Late Roman hillfort were discovered around 1900 and excavated for the first time between 1907 and 1932. After a long pause, excavations were re-started in 1997 as part of the Volcano Park project. The finds were archaeologically investigated in Koblenz and the town of Mayen under the direction of the state office for cultural heritage.
For the history of handicrafts the roofing finds were especially important. The roof slates found in the round towers were, surprisingly, shaped like scales, something which was rare in Roman times. 
In 2000, parts of the defensive wall and two round towers were reconstructed on original foundations of the walls. On the remains of the old military station on the hilltop, which had underfloor heating in the form of a hypocaust, a protective structure was built. All roofs were covered in slates in the form of scales and hexagons (for protection).

Sargent Kahanamoku

Sargent Hiikua Kahanamoku (March 5, 1910 – May 16, 1993) was a Native Hawaiian aquatic athlete and public relations spokesperson for Standard Oil Company. Sculptor Malvina Hoffman used him as her model for part of The Races of Mankind exhibit at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Sargent was the younger brother of Duke Kahanamoku.
Family background.
He was the youngest son born into a family of Native Hawaiians headed by Duke Halapu Kahanamoku and Julia Paʻakonia Lonokahikina Paoa. Both parents were direct descendants of Kamehameha I. His brothers were Duke, Samuel, David, William and Louis, all of whom participated in competitive aquatic sports. His sisters were Bernice, Kapiolani and Maria.
Athletics.
In 1925, at age 15 years, he won the backstroke event to help his 7th Grade classmates win a YMCA meet in Honolulu. At age 20, when he attended Andover Academy in Massachusetts, he won a 50-yard freestyle competition against a Yale University competitor.
Sargent was part of a crew for the July 22, 1933 canoe races off the Kona coast. Five days later, he and his friend Paul Fagan Jr. became stranded off the shore 3-1/2 miles from Diamond Head when Fagan's speed boat ran out of fuel. With no radio or other equipment aboard to help them, and no other boaters within signaling range, they began to drift out to sea. In a self-rescue reported on the front page of the "Honolulu Star-Bulletin", with no rescue in sight, Sargent spent four hours towing the boat back to shore with one hand, while he used his feet and other hand to paddle through the water.
He and his brother Sam, along with Fred Wilhelm and Melvin Paoa, paddling for the Outrigger Canoe Club, won in the Junior 4 on June 11, 1937. Through the next decade, Sargent continued to compete in local aquatic meets in Hawaii. During the August 15, 1946 holiday celebrating the prior year's surrender of Japan (known then as alternately "Victory Over Japan Day" or "Veterans Day"), Sargent steered his crew of the "Kakina" outrigger to victory.
Circa 1939-1940, Sargent took up the game of golf. As he got older, his golf activities began to replace the more vigorous competitive aquatic sports.
Business and personal life.
In 1931, sculptor Malvina Hoffman used Sargent as her model for "Hawaiian Surf-Rider, Polynesia", part of The Races of Mankind exhibit at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The exhibit eventually went into storage, but was revived at the Field Museum in 2016. 
He went to work for Standard Oil as its Hawaiian public relations representative, a position he held for 38 years. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited Hawaii in July 1934, Sargent and his brother Sam were part of the official welcoming ceremonies at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.
Sargent married school teacher Anna Furtado. She was elected to the Territorial House of Representatives, and to the State Senate after statehood was granted. The couple were King and Queen of Aloha Week in 1961. Sargent was appointed chairman of the Hawaiian Heart Fund in 1963. Anna died in 1969, and Sargent ran unsuccessfully for the State Senate on the Republican ticket. 
He married Catherine Toberman Torrence in 1970. Her father was famous Los Angeles developer Charles E. Toberman, known as “Mr. Hollywood” after building landmarks such as the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, Grauman's Chinese Theatre and Hollywood Bowl. She died in 1980. 
Sargent later married for a third time to Mary Ray, who described him as a people lover and an infinite source of stories of Hawaii. When Sargent died in 1993, his memorial service was held at the Outrigger Canoe Club.

Spinning Songs of Herbie Nichols

Spinning Songs of Herbie Nichols is a solo piano album by Simon Nabatov. It was recorded in concert in 2007 and released by Leo Records.
Recording and music.
The album of solo piano performances by Nabatov was recorded in concert at Loft, in Cologne, on 22 September 2007. The eight pieces were all composed by pianist Herbie Nichols. "Nabatov tears down these compositions and re-engineers the various melodies and structures."
Release and reception.
"Spinning Songs of Herbie Nichols" was released by Leo Records in February 2012. The "Cadence" reviewer wrote: "With an abundance of complexity, Nabatov is able to sustain his overlapping lines and constantly changing harmonic colors in a way that’s never excessive or showy, and never loses the music." "The Independent" described the performances as "marvellously jangly, madly syncopated vamping where the bones of the originals show through."
Performances of some of the same material were subsequently released on DVD by PanRec.

Pradeep Kumar (musician)

Pradeep Rangaswamy Kumar (born 12 May 1986) is an Indian playback singer and music director who has worked in Tamil language films. After beginning his career as a Carnatic musician, in the 2010s, he has regularly collaborated with composers Santhosh Narayanan and Sean Roldan.
Career.
Born to a police inspector father and a music teacher mother, Pradeep Kumar grew up in Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu. His mother, Lalitha Vijayakumar, taught Carnatic music through private lessons and at a government school in the area, meaning that Pradeep Kumar was constantly exposed to Carnatic music as a youngster and often joined his mother in singing at home. He later was introduced as a playback singer in Tamil cinema through the film "Attakathi" 
by Santhosh Narayanan He later began studying music under J. Venkataraman from the Aalathur School of music, who became his first guru.
Outside music, Pradeep Kumar studied science, wrote the engineering entrance examination and joined an engineering college in Thanjavur hoping to become a theoretical physicist. However after a week, he decided to opt out of college. As a backup career plan, he instead pursued a diploma course in audio engineering, which also taught him more about sound composition. In 2003, Pradeep Kumar visited Chennai to participate in a competition conducted by the music studio, Carnatica. K. Shashikiran of Carnatica heard him sing and requested that he stay back in Chennai and subsequently from 2003 to 2005, Pradeep Kumar stayed in Chennai to collaborate with Carnita, and his parents joined him later. He continued to perform in katcheris across Chennai and abroad, while also briefly serving as the secretary of the Youth Association of Classical Music, Chennai. Pradeep Kumar later became nuanced in western classical music after apprenticing with Augustin Paul, and also worked as an audio engineer for four years. In 2014, he worked on a documentary called "Arunagiri Perumale", which was a live concert recording of a three-piece Indian band along with a 16-piece chamber symphony orchestra, which had taken place in 2014, in Boston. He described the venture as his "pet project", and relied on crowd-funding to get it completed by 2017. During the same period, he married his fellow singer, Kalyani Nair. He also worked as a composer on his first film album for the Telugu project, "Maine Pyar Kiya" (2014).
Through his work as a musician, Pradeep Kumar became acquainted with composer Santhosh Narayanan. The pair had first met in Trichy when Pradeep Kumar was 18 and then continued to jam together, while studying for the same course in audio engineering. After Santhosh Narayanan became a film composer, Pradeep Kumar regularly worked as his acoustic guitarist. He later featured prominently as a singer, often collaborating with Santhosh Narayanan and another friend Sean Roldan in their albums including "Jigarthanda" (2014), "Irudhi Suttru" (2016) and "Kabali" (2016). He had also worked as a lyricist in "Jigarthanda". In 2016, a music critic from The Hindu labelled the three as "the new-age musical trio of Tamil cinema".
In 2017, Pradeep Kumar made his debut as a music composer in Tamil cinema after Santhosh Narayanan had convinced the producers of "Meyaadha Maan" to allow him to work on the film. Subsequently, Rathna Kumar who directed Meyaadha Maan selected him as a music director for Amala Paul's next film, Aadai.

Mariantonia Samà

Mariantonia Samà (2 March 1875 - 27 May 1953) was an Italian Roman Catholic. Samà lived alone with her mother until 1920 aiding her in domestic duties while coping with their poor state due to her father's death before Samà was born. But drinking unsafe water after working in the fields caused great infirmities and often-violent convulsions that the populace believed her to be possessed. In the town lived a baroness who organized for her to be taken to a Carthusian convent to be exorcised but this failed. Samà was healed after the convent's prior put her in front of a statue of Saint Bruno of Cologne and lived in relative peace for a while before being bedridden with another illness that she never recovered from.
Her mother tended to her until her death in 1920 at which point the populace as well as nuns and Redemptorist priests came to visit her to aid her and provide for her while also seeking her out for advice. Samà was close to the Sisters of the Sacred Heart who placed a black veil upon her head as if she were a nun too.
The beatification process had been called for since her death since the population came to believe she was a saint due to her reputation for personal holiness. The calls for such a process grew in the 2000s to the point where the formal cause was launched in her province. The process culminated on 18 December 2017 after Pope Francis confirmed her heroic virtue and named her as Venerable as a result. The pope also approved a decree confirming a miracle attributed to her in mid-2020; her beatification therefore can take place in Catanzaro on 3 October 2021.
Life.
Childhood.
Mariantonia Samà was born on 2 March 1875 as the sole child born to Bruno Samà (d. 20.06.1874) and Marianna Vivino (d. 24.02.1920). Her father had died a few months prior to her birth which left her mother alone to take care of the newborn child. The pair were poor and lived in a small home in a small lane almost five feet wide with dim light. Her baptism was celebrated on 3 March in the local parish. Her paternal grandmother was Antonia Frustaci and her maternal great-uncle was Antonio Vivino (09.10.1824-???). Her maternal grandparents were Giuseppe Vivino and Caterina Carioti. Samà made her First Communion and received her Confirmation in 1882.
The pair fostered a close bond with each other due to the pair living alone and her mother did all she could to provide for herself and her daughter despite their hardships. Samà was docile and obedient to her mother. The two were also illiterate and spoke the local dialect rather than the mainstream Italian language. The pair were also pious and walked barefoot in summer and winter to attend Mass at their church; their clothing was also poor and was minimal more so in wintertime. Samà often accompanied a mule loaded with wheat to the mill and would bring it back to the village with sacks of flour which would be exchanged for a loaf of bread each week.
Hardship.
In 1886 she followed her mother and some relatives to the Saluro River to clean clothing near the mill along the banks. En route home she was in a section of land known as Briga and there decided to quench her thirst so bent to drink from a water puddle she thought was clean (but in all likelihood was contaminated). But when she reached home she shrunk up and was immobile for about a month. During this period she often babbled incoherent things and often shook and twisted around. It was also strange in the mind of those who knew her condition that she ate past midnight and at no other time. But soon people came to believe that evil spirits had possessed her and so turned to God for a miracle. These attempts failed until the baroness Enrichetta Scoppa decided to intervene in 1894. The baroness organized for the immobile Samà to be taken to a Carthusian convent (that of Serra San Bruno) for an exorcism. The convent's archives revealed a monk's 15 paged narrative dated 1904 and detailing the baroness's plans. In June 1894 she was transported eight hours alongside her mother to the carrier but sealed in a wooden box with four people as her carriers. Samà was enclosed in the wooden box due to her often-violent convulsions. Her transporters were Antonio Mannello and Antonio Frustaci as well as the brothers Vincenzo and Giuseppe Lombardo (who all worked for the baroness). During the trip the box was opened to see if she required something but she declined and grew more and more agitated over time.
Their arrival at the convent was before noon with some of the locals following the procession to the convent where the exorcism rite began in Latin once the procession reached the convent's main gate. The absent convent's prior - who had been elsewhere - joined the crowd and the other monks for five hours turning to God for His grace but nothing happened. To that end the prior ordered a servant to get a silver bust containing the cranium and bones of Saint Bruno of Cologne. Once Samà saw this bust - which she believed was smiling at her - got up and hugged the bust proclaiming her condition to be healed. The crowd were elated that Samà's condition was resolved so the box and her old clothes were burned to the side of the convent to demonstrate a rebirth and renewal.
The Little Sister of Saint Bruno.
Samà returned home but in 1896 suffered from arthritis. The condition grew so bad to the point where she confined herself to her bed on her back with her bent knees raised. This would be the position she would remain in for the remainder of her life. Samà was immobile once more but could use her hands to recite rosaries and to eat. Her mother died in 1920 which left her alone until an older woman oversaw her care for a time. But the townsfolk visited her to help care for her. People bought her food and cooked meals as well as oils and fruits to sustain her without causing her pain and intestinal complications. But she was far too modest for the doctor to assess those areas that caused her greater pain and forbade the doctor from doing so. Those supplies she needed she kept for herself but donated the rest of the food supplies to the poor and said of it that "God will take care of me tomorrow!" There were those who offered financial assistance but she refused all attempts at this.
The wall opposite her had a large Crucifix and she would often stare at it and refer to Jesus as "that beautiful Jesus" as the best description possible for Him. The local priest would bring the Eucharist to her each morning as well as each noon and night at her request for she believed it bought her closer to Jesus. People who visited her often recited rosaries with her in Latin and countless others came to see her to ask her for advise. Her response would be to urge courage and hope.
The Sisters of the Sacred Heart - whom the baroness Scoppa had allowed to settle in her vacant palace - made her a "sister" and had a special reverence and love for her. To that end the order covered her head with the order's black veil and she became known as the "Little Sister of Saint Bruno". The nuns too took care of her and helped to both comb and bathe her. The local parish priest and the Redemptorist fathers also visited her and oversaw her spiritual care and guidance. In 1915 she dedicated herself to God through private vows with the permission of the parish priest.
Death and burial.
Samà died in the morning on 27 May 1953 while three women were at her bedside reciting litanies to the Blessed Mother; her gaze upon her death was at the Crucifix on the opposite wall and her last words were the names of Jesus and His mother. Upon her death she had no visible bedsores and her skin was both smooth and unblemished. Her remains were dressed in a white linen dress and carried in a procession through the streets in an open casket before their interment following her funeral on 29 May. Upon her death the parish priest wrote in the margins of her death certificate that Samà had "died in the concept of holiness". On 3 August 2003 her remains were relocated from the chapel of the Sisters of the Sacred Heart to a new special tomb constructed in the church of Santi Pietro e Paolo.
Beatification.
The Calabrian episcopate voiced their approval in launching the cause for the canonization for Samà after a favorable vote was taken on 20 April 2007. The diocesan investigation opened in the Catanzaro-Squillace archdiocese on 5 August 2007 and later concluded on 2 March 2009. But the formal introduction to the cause came under Pope Benedict XVI on 29 September 2007 after she was titled as a Servant of God and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued an edict declaring "nihil obstat" (no objections to the cause). But the C.C.S. requested that another investigation into Samà's life be undertaken and the process was opened on 20 October 2011 and was closed a couple of months later on 31 January 2012. The C.C.S. later validated these two processes in Rome on 9 June 2012.
The postulation drafted and later submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. officials on 15 September 2014 for evaluation with nine theologians approving the cause on 21 June 2016 after having assessed the dossier. The cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. approved the cause later on 5 December 2017. Samà became titled as Venerable on 18 December 2017 after Pope Francis confirmed that she had lived a model life of heroic virtue.
Her beatification depends upon one miracle receiving papal approval; the miracle needs to be a healing that both science and medicine fail to explain. There was one such case reported in Genoa which led to Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco overseeing a diocesan investigation into the case from 1 November 2008 until 23 October 2009. Medical experts approved this miracle in December 2019 as did theologians in the months following in addition to the C.C.S. members. Pope Francis signed a decree on 10 July 2020 confirming this healing as a miracle therefore enabling for Samà to be beatified in Catanzaro on 3 October 2021.
The current postulator for the cause is the Capuchin friar Carlo Calloni.

Daivame Kaithozham K. Kumar Akanam

Daivame Kaithozham K. Kumar Akanam is a 2018 Indian Malayalam-language film written and directed by Salim Kumar. It stars Jayaram and Anusree, and also features Salim Kumar, Sreenivasan, Nedumudi Venu, Harisree Ashokan, Anjali Nair, and Pradeep Kottayam. The film revolves around how the lives of K. Krishna Kumar (Jayaram) and his wife Nirmala (Anusree) go for a toss after lord almighty enters their house. This film is credited as 500th film appearance of Nedumudi Venu.
Plot.
The movie begins with the narration that God is planning to visit earth in order to study the humans closely and has sent his personal secretary Mayadathan to enquire about a suitable house for him to stay in. They choose the home of K. Kumar/ Krishna Kumar to stay for the duration of their visit, as he is the only person on earth who has never troubled god by praying for his needs.
God and Mayadathan arrive in Kerala and arrives at K Kumar's house. They are welcomed by the entire village and starts living at Krishna Kumar's house.
The next morning they see how life is for Krishna Kumar and his wife Nirmala. Kumar is the Panchayath Secretary and spends his time wandering around, while Nirmala spends all her time toiling in the kitchen and doing the household works. Also, Krishna Kumar is a loafer who needs his wife to do everything for him and yet doesn't appreciate it and often finds fault with her. This leads to constant bickering among the couple.
During one such fight, Nirmala and Krishna Kumar challenge each other to exchange their roles to prove whether men or women are stronger. God tries to dissuade them from this attempt and warns them that there would be dire consequences to this game. But both Nirmala and Krishna Kumar are adamant. So God allows them to do as they want.
From the next day, Nirmala goes to work and Krishna Kumar stays at home to do the household works that Nirmala used to do for him. While life is easy for Nirmala, Kumar struggles to cope with the stress of having to manage the home and Kitchen.
On a parallel track, the life of Nirmala's cousin Karimannur Gopi is shown. He lives with his wife, who is very lazy and doesn't want to cook, and his son. He is supposedly a friend of Lionel Messi and has opened a jewellery store in partnership with him.
In Kumar's house, after many days into the role swapping, Nirmala and Krishna Kumar decides to end it (as Nirmala is unable to bear how much Krishna Kumar is suffering) and tells the same to God. But God drops the bombshell by saying that it is impossible to switch the roles back now because to experience the life of a woman completely, Krishna Kumar's will have to get pregnant and give birth to a child. This shatters the couple.
The couple tries many attempts to outsmart god's plans by adopting different methods to try to abort the child Kumar is carrying but fails each time. Then the villagers come to know that Krishna Kumar is pregnant and therefore media takes up the issue and together they criticises Krishna Kumar for his pregnancy and all this makes him attempt suicide.
Then he wakes up hearing knocks on the door to find Gopi who tell him that Nirmala gave birth to a boy. It was then he realised that all he saw was just a dream.
Music.
The music for the film is composed by Nadirsha,

The Emperor of Ocean Park

The Emperor of Ocean Park is a 2002 novel by American author and law professor Stephen L. Carter. It is the first part of Carter's "Elm Harbor" series; two more novels in the series were published in 2007 and 2008. The book was Carter's first work of fiction, and spent 11 weeks on "The New York Times" best-seller list following its publication. Described as a murder mystery, the novel tells the story of Talcott Garland, a law professor who uncovers a mystery surrounding his father, the titular 'Emperor of Ocean Park'. Written from Tal's first person perspective, the book explores themes of privileged black identity, politics, and law, and contains many allusions to chess.
Because a number of publishing houses were interested in obtaining the rights to the book, Carter received an exceptionally large advance of $4.2 million. The size of the advance, for a debut novel from an African-American writer, contributed to an important shift for African-American literature, with the book marketed and received as a mainstream work of fiction, rather than one aimed at a specialized audience. The novel was well-reviewed by most critics, with attention being drawn to its then-unusual setting for a murder mystery story, featuring an African-American protagonist and with most of the story taking place in wealthy, predominately African-American neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. and Martha's Vineyard. It won the 2003 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award and BCALA Literary Award, and was nominated for several more, including the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work, Fiction and the New Blood Dagger from the Crime Writer's Association.
Plot.
Talcott 'Tal' Garland (known as Misha to his closest friends) is a black tenured law professor at Yale University, in New Haven, Connecticut. His wife, Kimberley Madison, known as Kimmer, is an attorney. Tal's father, Oliver Garland, a federal judge, has just died. Years earlier, Judge Oliver Garland had to decline a nomination from President Ronald Reagan for a seat on the Supreme Court due to the release of embarrassing information about his past, and then resigned from the bench. Following some years of heavy drinking, Oliver in his later life became a well-paid mascot for right-wing political groups. Judge Garland dies in suspicious circumstances, purportedly of a heart attack. The death brings together the Judge's three living children – Tal, Addison, and Mariah – for the funeral. A fourth child, Abby, died some years previously, in a hit and run car accident.
Talcott is named in Judge Garland's will as being responsible for the "final arrangements", which are not explained. Talcott's only clue is an obtuse note from his father telling him to search for "Angela's boyfriend", someone unknown to Talcott who apparently holds information that the Judge wants Talcott to have, and ending "Excelsior, my son! Excelsior! It begins!" – a reference to the Double Excelsior; the first of many chess references found within the trail of clues the Judge has left. Unbeknownst to Tal, the Judge had hired a private investigator to investigate his daughter's death. The investigator had been recommended by Jack Ziegler, one of his college roommates who later worked in espionage for the CIA, and in return, the Judge influenced some legislation to suit Ziegler. The investigator finds the car that killed Abby was driven by the son of a prominent US senator and his girlfriend, both of whom were subsequently killed in similar car accidents; it is later revealed at least one of these "accidents" was caused by the private investigator. The release of details of Judge Garland's relationship with Ziegler is what resulted in the Judge failing to gain a seat on the Supreme Court. Ziegler approaches Talcott at his father's funeral, demanding to know the details of the Judge's final arrangements. Two other interlinking plot threads feature Kimmer's campaigning for a highly sought after seat on one of the thirteen Federal Courts of Appeal, and the often-parlous state of Talcott and Kimmer's marriage. Kimmer, with whom Talcott first had an affair while she was married to one of Talcott's fellow law professors, is suggested as being unfaithful, although this is never confirmed.
Talcott discovers that parties including the FBI and an unknown assassin – later revealed as one of Judge Garland's fellow judges – are prepared to kill in order to obtain the details of the arrangements. Talcott follows a series of cryptic clues left by his father, including working out that "Angela's boyfriend" referred to his Uncle Derek, a communist and admirer of Angela Davis. Talcott finally learns that "the arrangement" to which the Judge referred was a floppy disk containing details of the many trials and legal decisions which the Judge illegally fixed in return for favors and payment from prominent people. The disk was hidden in a toy bear which belonged to Abby – Tal's deceased sister. The book ends with Talcott throwing the disk into a fire to start with a clean slate.
Development history.
Stephen L. Carter wrote "The Emperor of Ocean Park" while working as a Professor of Law at Yale. In a 2002 interview, Carter, who had already written several non-fiction books in his career, said that the idea for a fiction novel had "always been in the back of [his] mind", and that the major characters of the novel had been ones he had tried to fit into various drafts and unpublished stories over the preceding years. Carter started working on the book in the mid-1990s, writing mostly at night while working at Yale during the day; it took him four years to complete in draft.
He originally created an outline for the novel because that was how he wrote his scholarly arguments in non-fiction pieces, but soon found the outline restrictive as the story's content changed dramatically and discarded it. At one point, the draft manuscript grew to 1,300 pages long. In December 2000, Carter and his wife decided that he should focus all his time on finishing the final version. He spent six weeks "polishing the draft into shape".
Many of the legal and political topics addressed in the book, such as the workings of the FBI, the appointment process for the Supreme Court, and the political lobbying of judges were topics on which Carter had previously published non-fiction books and writings, making it possible for him to use this knowledge in writing the novel without requiring extensive research. In particular, his scholarly works "The Confirmation Mess", "The Culture of Disbelief", "Civility", and "Reflections of an Affirmative Action Baby" were all touchpoints in writing "The Emperor of Ocean Park".
Carter said his fiction writing was influenced by "Go Tell It on the Mountain" author James Baldwin and Langston Hughes, in particular how Hughes wrote dialogue.
A fierce bidding war for publication and adaptation rights ensued in early 2001 among American publishers Knopf, sister publisher Random House, and others. Carter was given $4.2 million, one of the largest advances ever received by a first-time author of fiction from Knopf for the rights to publish a book. The advance included the rights to Carter's second novel, "New England White", which was published in 2008. With Knopf and Random House making bids of equal value, Carter chose Knopf because he remembered the support he had been given from Knopf's editor-in chief, Sonny Mehta, who had read a few early draft chapters of the novel in 1998 and encouraged Carter to keep working on it. Carter received a further $1 million from Jonathan Cape for the British publishing rights.
The size of the advance was discussed widely. At the time of the novel's publication, "The Economist" described it as a "reckless gamble" by Knopf, noting Carter had never written a work of fiction before. Writing for "Newsweek", David Gates was also critical of the advance, which he suggested was "a way to make a Denzel Washington movie out of it", or that Knopf saw Carter as a black Tom Wolfe. Discussing the reviews in a piece for "The Weekly Standard", Arnold Beichman said that much of the criticism of the book was because of the large advance Carter received for his debut novel.
Publication history.
"The Emperor of Ocean Park" was first released in hardcover on June 2, 2002, published in the United States by Knopf. The paperback was released in the US on May 27, 2003.
In 2002, it became the first book featured on the "Today Show"s book club, where it was selected by writer John Grisham, who is known for his own legal mysteries. It was featured on the cover of "The New York Times" Book Review on June 16. The interest generated by a national print and television advertising campaign plus a twelve-city promotional tour, along with positive reviews and media attention, led Knopf to claim to have been required to print an additional 250,000 hardcover copies within the first month of the book's release to meet demand beyond the initial print run of 275,000. "The Observer" reported that this claim was an exaggeration on the publisher's part to drum up additional publicity, and the actual print run in total was around 300,000 copies, with the total sales in hardcover being around 350,000 copies. "The Emperor of Ocean Park" immediately went to number one on Amazon.com and spent 11 weeks on the "New York Times" best-seller list. Carter said that "the enthusiasm and even affection that has greeted the novel and the characters has overwhelmed me".
An audiobook version, narrated by Richard Allen, was released on July 21, 2003. "The Emperor of Ocean Park" forms part one of Carter's "Elm Harbor" series; the second book ("New England White") was released in 2007, and the third ("Palace Council") in 2008. Neither "New England White" nor "Palace Council" feature Talcott Garland as a character: "New England White" promotes two minor characters from "The Emperor of Ocean Park" – Lemaster and Julia Carlyle – to the main protagonists, and "Palace Council" is set from 1952–1974, with the main character, Eddie Wesley, being related to the Garland family by marriage.
Major themes.
"The Emperor of Ocean Park" was noted by many critics to bring together two themes – the "lowbrow" genre fiction style, in particular using the principles and thematic elements of a pulp thriller or murder mystery, and the "highbrow" literary fiction style, in which Carter reflects on black America – what Carter (as Talcott Garland) refers to as the "darker nation" – from a black perspective. Ocean Park is an area of Oak Bluffs, a summer colony on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Until the 1960s, Oak Bluffs was the only town on Martha's Vineyard that welcomed black tourists, as other towns on the island did not allow black guests to stay in inns and hotels. Carter summers there, and noted the enduring appeal of Martha's Vineyard to middle and upper-class African-American families.
Racial themes and expository sections on upper-class black culture form a large part of the narrative of "The Emperor of Ocean Park", with the lead character being described as highly self-conscious of his race and how that influences his life. Carter said in an online interview with MSNBC that he was "quite aware that very little in literature or in the media ever focuses on middle class and upper middle class Black Americans. If the success of this book means that publishers or film makers will be more interested in this class, that’s a good thing. On the other hand, I wouldn’t want the book’s focus on that group to mean we should stop thinking about those who are being left behind." Parallels were drawn between Carter's work and that of Lawrence Otis Graham, who explored the lives of upper-class black Americans in his social commentaries.
Professor Ben Barton of the "California Law Review" said the novel was "unmistakably a product by a legal academic"; Carter delves into great detail around a number of legal issues throughout the novel, calling upon his legal experience and research. Judge Oliver Garland is described as an amalgam of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas; Carter noted that he was inspired to write about Judge Garland's travails during his confirmation hearing by his having watched the hearings of Clarence Thomas. Carter wanted to ensure that his character's lives were fully rounded and, particularly as a Christian, he wanted the novel to reflect that many of his characters had religious beliefs. In one interview, he drew a comparison between those beliefs and the seemingly strictly secular world of the modern college campus.
The introductory epigraph ("Two fools always win, but three fools, never!") at the start of the book is a quote attributed by Carter to Siegbert Tarrasch, a chess writer of the late 19th and early 20th century. Chess plays a major part in "The Emperor of Ocean Park"; a member of the United States Chess Federation, Carter included a great number of allegories to chess within the novel, equating white characters with the white pieces, and black characters with the black. Early in the book, two pawns – one white, one black – go missing from the chessboard in Tal's father's study. The book is divided into three main sections, each named after an element of chess theory, again as allegories to the themes within the book; Nowotny Interference, in which two black pieces obstruct one another; Turton Doubling, when one white piece withdraws to enable a second white piece to move in front of it and jointly attack the black king; and Unprovided Flight, where only one move is available to the black king, and checkmate is imminent. The final chapter is entitled "Double Excelsior", in reference to the Excelsior problem, linking back to the Judge's original note for Talcott, and suggesting the one remaining black pawn (Tal) and the last white pawn (Ziegler) had been slowly moving toward one another, to be promoted to knights, with the only apparent ending being for the two pieces to collude (known as a "helpmate"), and the only possible result being that the black side must lose.
In a lengthy author's note at the end of the novel, Carter says that the book was decidedly not a "roman à clef". While superficially, Stephen Carter and Talcott Garland shared a number of characteristics – they were both middle-aged professors of law at Yale, both summered at Martha's Vineyard as part of the wealthy black community there, both were chess fans, both were married to other lawyers, and so on – Carter considered that the resemblance ended there. He says that Garland is an original literary creation, as are all the other characters. This was gently mocked by some critics. Political scientist Michael Nelson said the "similarities between creator and creature are just too numerous and important to ignore". Carter acknowledged the author's note was "absurdly long", justifying it a reaction to not being able to put footnotes throughout the book, unlike in his non-fiction writing. Instead, he appended them to the end of the novel, saying "I don’t think I could have written a novel, as a scholar, without making sure I got my facts right and making sure the reader knew."
Literary significance and reception.
In an early review, "Publishers Weekly" forecast that "The Emperor of Ocean Park" would bring Carter wide recognition as a novelist. The novel received a broadly positive reception upon release, although some responses were mixed. In a review for the "New York Times", writer Ward Just discussed at length the preoccupation of the book with describing the world of the black bourgeoisie, and suggested that "in Stephen Carter, the black upper class has found its Dreiser" – referring to the influential naturalist author Theodore Dreiser. It was described as an "expansively, constantly interesting book" by "The Detroit Free Press", which suggested it would be popular summer reading material. Like others, Jelani Cobb of "The Crisis" noted that the book features aspects of both genre and literary fiction, describing Carter's attempt to bring the two together as sprawling and sublime. He drew attention to the unusual protagonist, describing the Talcott Garland character as "jaded, overweight, and profoundly insecure". Historian Elizabeth Fox-Genovese considered the book to be "gripping", and noted that Carter had over a decade of experience in writing non-fiction about politics, law, and religion. She suggested that he may have used fiction to allow him more freedom to explore these topics, away from the didactic requirements of non-fiction.
In an episode of the "Newsnight Review" for the BBC, novelist Ian Rankin said he thought the book was "very well written but badly constructed" due to the conflation of a number of thriller cliches, and that the over-complicated plot obscured a great story. "The A.V. Club" suggested Carter had a tendency to overwrite, and too often strayed away from a "spellbinding" plot in the novel's exposition. Carter's writing style was noted for being at times dispassionate, and 'chilly', particularly when straying away from the more esoteric topics the novel covers and into the personal, with criticism of some descriptions (such as of a young child being "childlike"). The density of the book was discussed, with some reviewers suggesting that the multitude of references to chess required a certain knowledge of the game in order to appreciate the allusions and clues contained through the book. Others said that the writing was at times clunky, and the extensive social commentary detracted from the narrative flow. In a negative review for the "London Review of Books", critic Lorin Stein described the book as "long-winded [and] shoddily put together", and discussed why many American reviewers paid deference to what he thought was a high-toned airport novel. Stein found various inconsistencies within the book to be distracting, noting an example where a pool table appears mid-scene in a room previously described as "tiny", and said the plot was goofy and implausible.
The publication of "The Emperor of Ocean Park" was described as part of a major shift for African-American literature. Instead of being marketed as a niche novel, the record-breaking advance, the publicity around its release, and the jacket art placed it firmly in the mainstream, as a "blockbusting, best-selling legal thriller". It was noted by John Kevin Young, though, that despite the marketing for the novel being "color-blind", the reviews and press attention to the book still drew attention to the race of the author and the characters within the novel, suggesting that the world of wealthy African Americans had been previously "hidden" to the white reader. While such commentary was outside of Knopf's control, it reinforced the pattern of how the mainstream media responded to African-American literature.

Adaptations.
As part of the significant advance Carter obtained with Knopf in 2001, Knopf received the rights to any subsequent screen adaptations of "The Emperor of Ocean Park". "Variety" reported that, after reading an early version of the manuscript, a number of production companies were interested in acquiring the rights to create a movie adaptation of the novel. The rights were preemptively optioned by Warner Brothers, John Wells Productions, and Gaylord Films prior to the novel being published. Stephen Schiff completed a script adaptation in 2003 which was attached to director Carl Franklin, and Attica Locke, novelist, screenwriter and producer for the series "Empire", completed another script in 2009. Actor Wendell Pierce said in early 2015 that a movie adaptation of "The Emperor of Ocean Park" would be his dream project. It was also reported in 2015 that writer Katori Hall was working with John Wells on a television pilot of "The Emperor of Ocean Park" for Fox Network. Later that year writer Frank Bergon said that "last heard, the script was "under rewrite", maybe in "turnaround"."

Malacidin

Malacidins are a class of chemicals made by bacteria found in soil that can kill Gram-positive bacteria. Their activity appears to be dependent on calcium. The discovery of malacidins was published in 2018.
The malacidin family were discovered using a new method of soil microbiome screening that does not require cell culturing. This allowed researchers to identify genetic components necessary to produce the chemical. Malacidin A was shown to kill "Staphylococcus aureus" and other Gram-positive bacteria.
At the time of publication it was not certain if the discovery would lead to any new antibiotic drugs, because large investments of time and money are required to determine whether any drug is safe and effective.
Chemical structure.
Malacidins are macrocycle lipopeptides. The 2018 paper described two chemicals in the malacidin family, differing only by a methylene at their lipid tails. Their peptide cores include four non-proteinogenic amino acids. The name "malacidin" is derived from the abbreviation of "metagenomic acidic lipopeptide antibiotic" and the suffix "-cidin".
Mechanism of action.
Malacidins appear to take on their active conformation after they bind to calcium; the calcium-bound molecule then appears to bind to lipid II, a bacterial cell wall precursor molecule, leading to destruction of the cell wall and death of the bacteria. Therefore, they would be a new member of the class of calcium-dependent antibiotics. The discovery of malacidins supported the view that the calcium-dependent antibiotics are a larger class than previously thought.
History.
Malacidins were discovered by researchers at Rockefeller University, led by Brad Hover and Sean Brady. The group had been looking into antibiotics related to daptomycin and their calcium-dependent nature, but determined that it would be impractical to culture variations in lab conditions. Instead, the team used a genetics approach that was more scalable. They focused on searching for novel biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) – genes that are usually expressed together, that bacteria use to make secondary metabolites. To do this, they extracted DNA from around 2,000 soil samples to build metagenomic libraries that captured the genetic diversity of the environmental microbiome. They then designed degenerate primers to amplify genes likely to be similar to the BGC that make daptomycin by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure, sequenced the amplified genes, and then used metagenomics to confirm that these genes were indeed likely to be the kind of BGCs they sought. One of the novel BGCs they found was present in around 19% of the screened soil samples but not readily found in cultured microbial collections, so they took that BGC, put it into other host bacteria, and then isolated and analyzed the secondary metabolites. The work was published in "Nature Microbiology" in February 2018.
Research directions.
The approach of screening the soil for useful compounds using genomics has been done by others, and is likely to continue to be pursued as a method to further explore primary metabolites and secondary metabolites made by microorganisms.
, the malacidins had not been tested on humans. At the time of their discovery it was unknown whether the discovery would lead to any new antibiotic drugs; showing that a potential drug is safe and effective takes years of work and millions of dollars, and the scientists said at the time that they had no plans to try to develop a drug based on the work. In the 2018 paper, malacidins were shown to kill only Gram-positive bacteria and not Gram-negative bacteria. They were, however, able to kill multidrug-resistant pathogens, including bacteria resistant to vancomycin in the laboratory, and methicillin-resistant "Staphylococcus aureus" (MRSA) skin infections in an animal wound model.
Brady, Hover, and two other authors disclosed in the 2018 paper that they had "competing financial interests, as they are employees or consultants of Lodo Therapeutics." Lodo was founded in 2016 out of Brady's laboratory, to discover new chemicals in nature as starting points for drug discovery.

Maskoskanaw River

Maskoskanaw River is a tributary of Frontenac Lake (Milieu River), flowing into the unorganized territory of Lac-Ashuapmushuan, Quebec, in the Regional County Municipality (MRC) of Le Domaine-du-Roy, in the administrative region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in Quebec, in Canada.
The Maskoskanaw River flows successively into the townships of Huard and Buade. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second.
The forest road R0212 (East-West direction) cuts the middle of the course of the Milieu River (Normandin River). The route 451 linking La Tuque to Obedjiwan, Quebec passes south of Patterson Lake; several secondary road branches serving the surroundings of this head lake.
The surface of the Maskoskanaw River is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice movement is generally from mid-November to mid-April.
Toponymy.
The toponym "Maskoskanaw River" was formalized on September 6, 1984, at the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

Auguste Warnier

Auguste Hubert Warnier (8 January 1810 – 15 March 1875) was a French medical doctor, journalist and politician who spent most of his career in Algeria.
At first he was a Saint-Simonian and was sympathetic to the local population.
He thought the Berbers had Germanic blood and a civilization derived from Roman and Christian origins, so could readily adapt to French civilization.
He had no respect for the Arab "intruders".
Later he took the view that the indigenous people had destroyed the once-fertile environment of Algeria, became a proponent of French colonization and opposed the "Arab Kingdom" policy of Napoleon III.
In his last years he was a Representative in the National Assembly for the Province of Algiers.
He was responsible for a law that allowed expropriation of land or forced sale to colonists.
Early years (1810–34).
Auguste Hubert Warnier was born on 8 January 1810 in Rocroi, Ardennes.
His parents were Jean-Louis Warnier (1774–1814), Lieutenant in the 6th line regiment and Knight of the Legion of Honour, and Marie Salomé Victoire Seguin (c. 1789–1849).
He received a classical education in Reims.
He studied medicine in Paris.
After passing his medical examinations he was in turn attached to the Val-de-Grâce military hospital in Paris and the military hospital in Lille.
By 1931 he was a military doctor.
He was named assistant surgeon in Douai in 1832.
July Monarchy (1834–48).
Warnier was sent to Oran during the cholera outbreak of 1834.
In Algeria he studied the customs and language of the Arabs while serving with the ambulances of the Army of Africa.
In 1835 he was cited for his role in the fighting at Mostaganem for having recovered, alone, a dying soldier from the field of battle.
Warnier joined the Service des Affaires Arabes in 1837 and served in Mascara until 1839 treating the indigenous people and fighting cholera.
In the process he gained a solid understanding of Arab society.
Warnier served with the consul Eugène Daumas in Mascara, and Daumas wrote to his commanding officer in Oran saying he was a congenial and talented assistant.
He was praised for his medical skill, his humanity and his knowledge of Algeria and its peoples.
In 1838 he was a member of the mission sent to the Emir Abdelkader after the Treaty of Tafna.
In 1939 he completed his medical studies and received a doctorate in medicine from the University of Montpellier.
Warnier and Joanny André Napoléon Perier were the two physicians on the Scientific Commission for the Exploration of Algeria, which operated from 1840 to 1842 and resulted in the publication of 39 volumes on a range of subjects.
Warnier met the Saint-Simonian leader Prosper Enfantin, whom he befriended, and became one of Enfantin's most faithful collaborators.
As a Saint-Simonian he earned hostility from some quarters, praise from others.
In 1843 Warnier represented the government to prisoners captured at the Battle of the Smala.
He was attached to the maritime expedition to Morocco in 1844, and sent almost daily reports to Enfantin who published them in his newspaper "Algeria".
He was in charge of negotiating the Treaty of Tangiers (1844).
He was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honour on 17 October 1844.
He was then director of civil affairs in Oran.
In an official publication in 1847 Warnier and Ernest Carette() wrote positively about the nomads, although later Warnier would support colonialism.
Warnier considered that the local people formed three groups: 1 million were Berbers who spoke the Berber language.
1.2 million were Arab-speaking Berbers and 500,000 were pure Arabs or other minorities such as Turks and Moors.
Daumas was among those who thought the Kabyle people, the largest Berber group, were partly Germanic in origin, had formerly been Christians and had not been fully converted to Islam. 
In an 1865 book Warnier extended this theory to cover all Berbers.
The cross-like tattoos on the faces of many Kabyles was taken as evidence.
Warnier believed that the Berber civilization had evolved from Roman and Christian traditions, and the Berber speakers, in particular, had escaped the pernicious influence of the Arabs and could adapt to French civilization.
The Arab intruders, in his view, had never established anything of value and would remain alien nomads.
Second Republic and Second Empire (1848–70).
During the French Second Republic Warnier was a member of the council of the government of Algeria in 1848–49.
He returned to private life, and in 1850 founded the "Atlas" newspaper.
This was suppressed after the coup d'état of 2 December 1951.
Warnier was one of the last companions of Père Enfantin, and stayed as a colonist in the Sahel of Algiers Province.
During the Second French Empire Warnier created a large agricultural establishment on the banks of the old Lake Alloula.
For many years Warnier was a strong supporter of projects to open up the Sahara.
He helped Henri Duveyrier, son of one of his and Enfantin's friends.
Duveyrier was Warnier's guest in 1857 at his home in Kandouri, a suburb of Algiers, where he met Oscar MacCarthy.
On 8 March 1857 Duveyrier and MacCarthy left on a five-week trip to Laghouat and back.
Duveyrier was fascinated by the Tuaregs he met on this trip and the next year gave an account of Tuareg customs to the Berlin Oriental Society.
Later Duveyrier made an unsuccessful attempt to reach Tuat, which was stopped by the Tuaregs at El Goléa.
Duveyrier left in May 1859 and after an exhausting journey returned to Warnier's house on 5 December 1861, emaciated and delirious with fever.
By the early 1860s Warnier was no longer associated with the army or the Saint-Simonians, but had become a spokesman for the "colons".
He had retired from the army in 1861.
His "L'Algérie devant le Sénat" (1863), a collection of his articles from "L'Opinion Nationale", laid out the principles for colonization of Algeria by civilian settlers.
It was widely read in France, and was followed by several other books along the same lines.
In 1862 he was the doctor and confidant of Sheikh Othman during his trip to France.
Sheikh Othman was leader of the religious Iforas tribe of the Kel Ajjer and had been Duveyrier's host in 1859.
Warnier gained great prestige among the settlers since he and Jules Duval() in Paris were leaders of a group opposed to the emperor's Arab Kingdom policy.
In 1869 Warnier and Jules Duval wrote that, "In their rebellions against our authority, the indigènes are able to distinguish between the "colon" and the solder." 
They said the government downplayed this fact since it would undermine the justification for the "exceptional" military regime.
Warner tried to fight the government in Algeria and published several brochures on the subject.
Warnier was skeptical about Napoleon's 1865 "sénatus-consulte" that defined conditions for native Algerians to become French citizens.
He wrote in 1865,
Warnier thought the imperial government was sacrificing the interests of the French settlers in favour of the Arab aristocracy, which wanted to prevent progress and maintain their feudal control.
He provided proof, based on crop production and taxes paid, that one settler was worth ten indigenous people.
In 1865 Warnier blamed the nomads for destroying the Algerian environment, writing that the land was "long ago a sort of terrestrial paradise ... today this land is a sterile desert."
Third Republic (1870–75).
After the fall of the empire, on 5 September 1870 Warnier became Prefect of Algiers.
He resigned from this position to run as candidate for the National Assembly in Algiers on 17 February 1871, but was defeated.
Warnier ran again in the same department on 9 July 1871 after the resignation of Joseph Garibaldi and this time was elected.
He was also a General counselor of the province of Algiers from August 1870.
In the Assembly he sat with the left, voted against the bishops' petition, against the resignation of Adolphe Thiers, against the septennate and against the ministry of Albert, 4th duc de Broglie.
The government of the French Third Republic reversed the policy of Napoleon III and gave strong support to the French colonists in Algeria.
The Algerian revolt of 1871–72 was crushed and the Algerians were subsequently repressed.
Warnier used the narrative of destruction of the environment by the local people to justify the 1873 settlers' property law that took his name.
The "Loi Warnier" accelerated the alienation of the peasantry of Algeria from their lands.
Islamic Law no longer applied to landholdings.
The law facilitated forced purchase or confiscation of land by the colonists.
While deputy, Warnier introduced Hippolyte Mircher to the future explorer of French Africa Paul Soleillet.
Warnier also introduced Soleillet to Léon Cremieux, president of the Israelite Alliance of Algeria, who had obtained French citizenship for Algerian Jews.
Auguste Warnier died in office on 15 March 1875 in Versailles, Yvelines.
The fungus "Lenzites warnieri" is named after him.
It was found growing on the trunks of elms in Warnier's Kandouri property.

Josefina Samper

Josefina Samper Rojas (8 May 1927 – 13 February 2018) was a Spanish syndicalist and feminist, member of the Communist Party of Spain and spouse of Marcelino Camacho.
Biography.
Born in Fondón on 8 May 1927, when she was three years old her father, a miner, emigrated to Oran, Algeria, joining the rest of her family a year later. There, Josefina took care of her sister while her mother worked washing clothes in the houses. Later, Josefina went to work as a trouser dresser in a clothing workshop. At age 12 she started militancy in the Unified Socialist Youth, and at 14 she joined the PCE at the hands of Roberto Carrillo, brother of Santiago Carrillo.
As a party activist, Josefina participated in the distribution of the "España Popular" publications. She also organized the children of the neighborhood to warn using cans as a drum every time the police arrived in search of the hidden Republicans. She also created a kind of cooperative dedicated to the manufacture of raffia shoes with which she helped to maintain her house, as well as that of many other families, mostly of political emigrants. Josefina was responsible for getting the raffia. The benefits were divided according to the pairs of shoes they made, with Josefina obtaining the lowest profits.
Work with Marcelino Camacho.
Soon, together with other women, she formed a support group for immigrants and political refugees, which, in 1944, led her to receive, on behalf of the party, the task of organizing an aperitif for three prisoners fled from the concentration camp. That is how she met Marcelino Camacho, with whom she married on December 22, 1948 and who had two children, Yenia and Marcel. In 1957, after the pardon of Marcelino, they returned from exile, moving to the neighborhood of Carabanchel, in Madrid, in a modest apartment where they lived until, already in 2010, Marcelino's health forced them to move to another floor in Majadahonda. In his neighborhood of Carabanchel both continued their clandestine political and trade union activity that led to the successive imprisonment of Marcelino. It was then that Josefina and other women, some wives of prisoners and others simply Communist women, mobilized, creating in 1965 the Women's Democratic Movement, germen of the current feminist movement, dedicated to fighting, inside and outside of Spain, to help political prisoners, achieving certain improvements in the conditions in which they were confined. During these years, Josefina gave up looking for a job outside the home, because she needed to dedicate all her time to the cause, so her children, Yenia and Marcel, took responsibility for taking the salary to the family home, while Josefina spent the little time she had to sew pants for a tailor shop and knit sweaters for a wool store.
On November 25, 1975, King Juan Carlos I granted a pardon to the prisoners who had been imprisoned by the , including Marcelino Camacho. Thus began a new life outside the clandestine life that allowed them to rekindle the political and union struggle that Josefina still maintained a few years after the death of Marcelino.
Later years.
After the death of Marcelino Camacho on 29 October 2010, Josefina maintained a great activity as a transmitter of the memory and voice of her husband, offering frequent talks throughout Spain, helping to inspire the struggle for workers' rights to the new generations. She died on 13 February 2018.

Metropolitan Trails

Metropolitan Trails are urban and suburban hiking trails. As defined by French NGO "Sentiers Métropolitains", they encourage walkers to discover a metropolitan territory, in several days of hiking.
Origins.
The first official metropolitan trail was the GR2013, a GR footpath around Marseille, launched for Marseille-Provence 2013 European event.
Development.
Besides GR2013, other metropolitan trails have been designed; like "Inspiral London", "Iki Deniz Arası” ("Between Two Seas") in Istanbul, "Parcours Métropolitain du Grand Lyon", "Sentier de Randonnée Périurbaine" in Bordeaux, or "Sentieri Metropolitani Milano".
Organization.
Marseille-based not-for-profit organization "Sentiers Métropolitains" is in charge of the coordination of many trails, including Marseilles, Paris and Avignon. As explained on their website, the design of metropolitan trails takes its roots in hiking, culture, urbanism and art.

Nakayama Shinnosuke

Nakayama Shinnosuke (中山 眞之亮, June 19, 1866 – December 31, 1914) was the first Shinbashira of Tenrikyo. He was the grandson of Nakayama Miki, the foundress of Tenrikyo.
Biography.
According to Tenrikyo tradition, Nakayama Miki named Shinnosuke and designated him the Shinbashira while he was still in the womb. He was born to parents Kajimoto Sojiro and Haru in the second year of the Japanese era Keiō, on the seventh day of the fifth month, which corresponds to June 19, 1866 in the Gregorian calendar. Shinnosuke was raised in the Kajimoto household in Ichinomoto Village until 1880, when Shinnosuke began to reside at the Nakayama household. Shinnosuke was officially adopted into the Nakayama family on September 23, 1881, and became the family's legal successor on September 22, 1882.
In 1896, Shinnosuke wrote the "Oyasama gyoden" ("The Biography of Oyasama"), the text on which Tenrikyo Church Headquarters' official biography of Nakayama Miki, "The Life of Oyasama", would be based.

John Lyth

John Lyth, D. D. (13 March 1821 – 13 March 1886) was an English Wesleyan Methodist preacher, author, historian and hymn writer. He was the earliest Wesleyan missionary in Germany.
Biography.
Lyth was born on 13 March 1821 in York. He attended Mr. Heigham's Academy in Doncaster, and began work as a preacher in 1843. In 1859 he became the first Wesleyan missionary in Germany, serving as the General Superintendent of the Wesleyan Community from 1859 to 1865. Lyth retired from the ministry in 1883, and died on 13 March 1886.
Works.
Prose.
Lyth contributed to four major prose publications during his lifetime. In 1843, he published the "History of Methodism in York". This is considered his main work of prose, despite his later release of "Glimpses in Early Methodism in York" in 1885. "Glimpses of Methodism in York" covers from the introduction of Methodism in 1729 up to the date of publication. Upon his mother's death in 1860, Lyth compiled and published "The Blessedness of Religion In Earnest: A Memorial of Mrs. Mary Lyth, of York." Published in 1861 and constructed mainly from Mary's journal entries, Lyth created this memorial because he felt "an example of 'Religion in Earnest,' so pre-eminent, should not pass unrecorded and unimproved."
Half a decade later, Lyth published "The Homiletical Treasury; or, Scripture Analytically Arranged." Originally intended to encompass the entire Bible, "The Homiletical Treasury" only covers Isaiah (published in 1867) and the Epistles from Romans to Philippians (published 1869). At the date of publication, the "London Quarterly Review" "[commended] the work, and [trusted] that Mr. Lyth [would] be encouraged to continue his labors," and his work was cited often in an 1884 homiletical commentary. Charles Spurgeon, however, found "Homiletical Treasury" to be incomplete and surface.
Hymns and poetry.
Lyth also wrote a few hymns. "There Is a Better World, They Say" is a hymn originally written for an infant school in Randwick. Lyth said "that it was written for infant children will explain the simplicity of some of the expressions." Lyth claimed this hymn was based on an earlier piece and dates its writing as 30 April 1845. It was written to the tune of "All is Well," and first appeared in the "Home and School Hymn Book". He also wrote "We Won't Give Up the Sabbath," which was included in the "Methodist Sunday School Hymn Book" in 1879. Both hymns are imitations of older works. "Wild Flowers; or, a Selection of Original Poetry, edited by J. L." was compiled and published in 1843. All of the poems Lyth included were written by himself, a family member, or Dr. Punshon.
Lyth's verse rendering of Marcus Aurelius's Meditations was published in 1942, with a preface by Gilbert Murray.

The flag of the Organization of American States was used for the first time during the administration of Secretary General José Antonio Mora. The flag consists of the seal of the Organization, which represents the flags of all the Member States, on a royal blue background. This stamp with the flags is seen for the first time on memorandum paper in the twenties, during the General Direction of Mr. Leo S. Rowe. The flag was ordered to the company Annin &amp; Co., of New York, in April 1961. The color of the fund that was chosen was real blue that was neither light blue, nor dark blue. In the center are the flags of all the member countries placed in a circular shape, with ten masts at the bottom and framed by a circle. The design was updated for the last time in 1991 when Belize and Guyana joined the Organization of American States. Each time a new member state enters, its flag is incorporated into the design. The use of the flag has been established in accordance with the traditions and customs in exercise throughout the years in the Organization.
Vexillological description.
The design consists of a rectangle of blue background with a white circle, bordered in gold, in its center. On the inside of this circle is the organization shell consisting of a grouping of flags of all member states, which are currently 35, hoisted on golden masts. The order of the flags is given in Spanish alphabetical order, starting with Antigua and Barbuda in the lower left, following clockwise until Venezuela in the lower right.

San Pietro a Varlungo, Florence

San Pietro a Varlungo () is Roman Catholic church located on via di Varlungo in Florence, Italy. It was located outside of the former late-medieval walls of Florence.
History.
A church at the site has a long history, and tradition holds that Charlemagne stayed at this site. Documents from the beginning of the 12th-century document the church. The early patronage of the structure was by the Bonciani family, but in the 17th century it underwent reconstruction. In the 19th century, the belltower was erected and the facade portico was eliminated.
During the Second World War, the parish arranged sanctuary to persecuted Jews from Florence. The parish leaders, Leto Casini and Giovanni Simioni are recognized as meriting the honorific title of Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem.
Interior.
The narrow interior nave contains notable works of art dating to the 17th century refurbishment, including a fresco (1699) by Alessandro Gherardini; a "Glory of St Jospth" and a "Baptism of Christ" by Onorio Marinari; and a barrel-vaulted ceiling fresco depicts "St Peter in Glory with Faith, Hope, and Charity" by Baldassarre Franceschini called "il Volterrano". The ciborium, made of pietra serena, was sculpted in the 15th century.
In the transept is housed a 13th-century tempera on wood painting depicting the "Madonna and Child" by the artist called the Master of Varlungo, a putative pupil of Cimabue. The adjacent oratory has a venerated wooden crucifix and in the canonry there is a tabernacle by Guarlone. On the street is a tabernacle from the school of Ghirlandaio depicting the "Virgin and St John the Evangelist".

Master of Varlungo

The Master of Varlungo was an Italian painter active in a Gothic style around Florence between 1285 and 1310.
No documentation exists about the painter; his name is attached to pictures dating from the last two decades of the thirteenth century. His central work is a fragmentary "Madonna and Child" still located in the church of San Pietro a Varlungo, Florence. On a stylistic basis, he was assigned by Roberto Longhi in 1948 as a principal pupil of Cimabue, and as influenced by Giotto. A panel at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, depicting a "Madonna and Child Enthroned with Angels" has been attributed to this painter.

Louis XVI furniture

Louis XVI furniture is characterized by elegance and neoclassicism, a return to ancient Greek and Roman models. Much of it was designed and made for Queen Marie Antoinette for the new apartments she created in the Palace of Versailles, Palace of Fontainebleau, the Tuileries Palace, and other royal residences. The finest craftsmen of the time, including Jean-Henri Riesener, Georges Jacob, Martin Carlin, and Jean-François Leleu, were engaged to design and make her furniture.
History.
With the death of Louis XV on May 10, 1774, his grandson Louis XVI became King of France at age twenty. The new king had little interest in the arts, but his wife, Marie-Antoinette, and her brothers-in-law, the Comte de Provence (the future Louis XVIII) and the Comte d'Artois (the future Charles X), were deeply interested in the arts, gave their protection to artists, and ordered large amounts of furniture in the neoclassical style, inspired by Greco-Roman art. They were followed by the wealthy nobles who furnished their chateaux and Paris town houses in the new style.
The transition from the baroque and the rocaille style to the neoclassical style had begun in about 1760, near the end of the reign of Louis XV. It was advanced by the reports of the discoveries at the archeological sites at Herculaneum and Pompeii. Madame de Pompadour, mistress of Louis XV, had dispatched a group of scholars to Italy to report on the findings. The group included the designer Jean-Charles Delafosse and the Flemish architect, sculptor and engraver Jean-François de Nefforge. Their engravings of Greek and Roman art inspired many furniture designers and particularly the "ébénistes", who made the fine marquetry inlaid ornament that decorated chests and tables.
Marie-Antoinette was a promoter of the new style even before she became queen. In 1770, after her marriage to the Dauphin Louis, she took over the apartments of the former queen, Marie Leczinska, who had died in 1768. In 1779, she commissioned the architect Richard Mique to completely redo the Cabinet of the Queen. He covered the walls with white satin embroidered with flowers, arabesques and medallions. In 1783, she decided to renew the decor once again, this time with wood panels sculpted and painted white, decorated with gilded neoclassical frames and designs, including sphinxes and tripods, given lightness by bouquets of flowers. The fireplace, made of dark red stone, was ornamented with gilded bronze caryatides. The furniture for the room was made by Jean Henri Riesener and included a commode, a corner table and a secretary inlaid with cedar wood, amarante, and medallions of gilded bronze. It also included a sofa with a gilded frame placed in a niche surrounded by mirrors, and facing the window. This room, with its combination of comfort, intimacy and luxury, is among the most classic examples of Louis XVI style. It has been restored to its original appearance, while some of the original furniture is now in the Wallace Collection in London.
Another notable influence to the style was the work of the British designer Robert Adam, particularly in the design of chairs, and in the use of mahogany wood, which was quickly adapted in France.
A majority of the top "ébénistes" were German or of German descent, which gave them a common language with Marie-Antoinette. The most prominent figures under Louis XVI were Jean Henri Riesener, who received the title of "ébéniste ordinaire" of the royal household in 1774. His main rival was Jean-François Leleu, one of the few who was not German. Other "ébénistes", including Martin Carlin and Adam Weisweiler, worked primarily for furniture merchants who supplied the wealthy Parisian upper class. They developed a new genre, decorating furniture with plaques of Sevres porcelain or lacquered wood panels. The "ébéniste" David Roentgen kept his workshop in Germany, though many of his clients were in Paris. He became particularly famous for his elaborate desks, which frequently had mechanical folding features.
The French Revolution caused the dispersal of the royal furniture; most of the owners went to the guillotine, or fled into exile. Their furniture confiscated and was sold by the successive governments in enormous lots, with the proceeds helping the finance the long wars of the period. The furnishings of the Palace of Versaille was auctioned off between Sunday, August 25, 1793 until 11 August 1794, and were widely scattered. Many of the buyers were British, and some of the finest items went to the British royal family and to the Wallace Collection. In the 19th century, many of the pieces of furniture migrated again, sold by British aristocrats to wealthy Americans. Extensive collections are found today in the Museum of Decorative Arts and Louvre in Paris; the Wallace Collection and Victoria and Albert Museum in London; the Metropolitan Museum in New York; and the Getty Museum in Los Angeles.
Craftsmen, merchants, designers.
The fine furniture of the period was made by craftsmen who belonged to guilds or corporations which strictly regulated the work of their members, as well as the access to the profession. The reform-minded prime minister of Louis XVI, Turgot, attempted to suppress the power of the corporations in 1776, but, meeting fierce resistance from the artisans, he withdrew his reforms, and then, a few months later, was forced to resign himself.
The work of making furniture was strictly divided into several crafts: 
In addition to the craftsmen, there were the "marchands-merciers", the merchants who met with clients, took the orders and commissioned the work, and the "ornementistes", gradually becoming known as "décorateurs", who designed the furniture.
An "estampille", or stamp of the craftsmen, was required on the finished work. The "menuisiers" made the stamp of their name or initials on the bottom of chairs, while the "ébénistes" put their names under the crossbeam of bureaus or under the marble tops of consoles. Many of the marks today are difficult to read, and counterfeit marks were not unknown, since they could greatly increase the value of the furniture.
Materials.
The body of the furniture, the part crafted by "menuisiers", was usually made of woods found in France. Cherry wood and walnut were often used, especially in regional furniture. Beech was commonly used for chairs, since it was solid, easily sculpted, and could be easily gilded and painted. Oak was rarely used, because it was hard and difficult to carve. It was usually reserved for frames and mountings.
The decorative woods for "marquetry" were termed "Bois des Indes" and usually came from South America or the West Indies. They were often named by their color rather than botanical name; "bois de rose", "bois de violette", and "bois d,amaranthe". The late Louis XVI period, and a passion for things English, brought an enthusiasm for mahogany.
Chairs and sofas.
The chairs of the Louis XV period were characterized by elegance, lightness and simplicity of form. The most notable craftsmen of chairs were Georges Jacob, furnisher to the Royal "Garde-Meuble", or furniture depot, from 1774, and Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené who obtained the title of official "fourniseur" in 1785.
The basic types of chairs were little changed from the Louis XV style, but a wider variety of forms appeared, particularly in the "dossier", or back, of the armchairs. These included "en raquette", "en chapeau", "en lyre", "en grebe", "en anse de pannier", and, the most popular, "en médaillon". Another popular variation of "dossier" was the "à chapeau du gendarme", or "policeman's hat". The most classical elements of the chairs were the legs; they were usually carved like Roman or Greek columns tapering to the end, a style called "effilés". The decoration of upholstery, following the taste of Marie-Antoinette, and to match the decoration on the walls, was usually floral, 
The "chaise voyeuse", a type invented under Louis XV, remained popular, It featured an armrest on the top, was designed so the person sitting could sit astride with his arms on the top of the chair back, for playing cards. A set of four of these chairs was made by Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené for Madame Elizabeth, sister of Marie-Antoinette, and was delivered in 1789, the year of the beginning of the French Revolution.
Another original type that appeared under Louis XVI was the "Fauteul de Bureau", or office chair. A set was made by Henri Jacob, brother of Georges Jacob, in about 1785, made of carved walnut, cane and lester. The seat was mounted on a circular platform, and could turn around, the first recorded swivel chair. In 1790 Henri Jacob produced a series of drawings of fanciful "Etruscan" furniture, inspired by a British movement and anticipating the wave of neoclassicism of the French Directory. 
Tables.
The console table, which had first appeared under Louis XV, was designed to be against or attached to the wall, and was often made by the same "menuisiers" who created the wooden wall panelling. It was decorated only on the front and sides. The top was made of marble or other stone, and was either rectangular of half-moon shaped. It usual had four feet, joined together an X-shaped or H-shaped brace for stability. The central point of the brace under the console often had a pedestal, where pieces of fine porcelain could be displayed. Some smaller consoles had only a single foot, decorated with carved garlands of flowers.
Unlike the highly-ornamented consoles of Louis XV furniture, with twisting rocaille sculpture, Louis XVI consoles, particularly in the late years, had an elegant simplicity. They included small varieties, such as the "Console-Desserte", half-moon shaped, with a white marble and a simple wooden platform below supporting the legs, it was made of oak and mahogany, with slender tapering straight legs, with small drawers, discreet gilded bronze ornament, and a delicate ring of gilded bronze around the top. Other small consoles featured discreet marquetry of ebony, rosewood, tinted beech, and ash wood.
A variety of smaller, more portable tables, also appeared, made either by "menuisiers" of sculpted wood or by "ébénistes" with inlaid marquetry of exotic woods and materials. These included tables for playing cards, tables for writing, and "tables de toilette", or dressing tables, which were usually of a simple form covered with fabric with embroidered designs or with lace.
During the late reign of Louis XVI, between 1780 and 1790, the British custom of having a round dining room table permanently positioned in the center of a dining room, gradually took hold in France. These tables often had casters on the legs, so they could be moved more easily, and had an extra two legs in the center, so additional sections could be added to enlarge the table.
Another type of table adapted from the British model was the guéridon, a small round table on a single column, with a base of three legs, often with small wheels or "roulettes". The German-born "ebeniste" David Roentgen made a small oval table with drawers that folded out in around 1780, It was crafted of oak, rosewood, sycamore, boxwood and ebony, ornamented with guilder bronze and extremely fine marquetry in delicate floral patterns made of different colored woods. There were also tables for the popular salon game of trictrac, as well as small writing tables, which sometimes had surfaces decorated with marquetry images of envelopes, pens, and books.
Another new type of small table was the "Bonheur-du-jour", usually used as a dressing table. It had long legs, a semi-circular parquet platform, a drawer, and several small compartments and drawers on top. An oval shelf supported the legs. and oval tray supporting the legs.
Commodes and cabinets.
The commode was the grand showcase of the marquetry skills of the "ébénistes". A new form of commode appeared, called "a la greque", which was cubic in form, with very short gilded bronze feet, and a face covered with inlaid decoration in geometric patterns of rosewood, amaranth, boxwood, and ebony, sometimes in a pattern of cubes, or a checkerboard, or the "batons romp" or broken stick pattern. Neoclassic themes appeared especially in the gilded bronze decoration; it commonly featured gilded bronze masks of Apollo or Mercury, gilded bronze drawer handles in the form of garlands of leaves or drapery, and a frieze in a geometric pattern around the top. Another popular form late in the period was a chest decorated with plaques of Sevres porcelain, usually with floral patterns. These were a specialty of the designer Martin Carlin. A more exotic material appeared in a cabinet for medals made for Louis XVI in 1788. The drawers were decorated with gilding and with real feathers and insect wings waxed and applied to the surface.
The marquetry decoration of commodes usually featured trophies or designs representing of love or music, flowers, and sometimes, in the passion for exotic themes, Chinese or Japanese objects. They began to have panels attached which were varnished to appear like Japanese lacquer.
The "meuble d'appui" was a type of commode with doors on the front, which, like commodes, had a marble top and a highly decorated face, and was designed to display decorative objects, either porcelain or candlesticks or clocks. Some variations had a central cupboard with a door, and shelves on either side for displaying vases or other objects. The commodes at the end of the reign often had friezes of stylized palm leaves abad other vegetal designs.
Later in the reign, a new variant was the commode "a vantaux", where the drawers or shelves nside the cabinet were concealed with two doors. The "ébéniste" Jean-François Leleu went even further and designed a commode with no legs, which was simply placed on a wooden base, the version that became common in the 19th century. Later commodes often took a half-moon form, and had less decoration and ornament; their beauty came from the quality of the mahogany employed for the facing.
Some other specialized cabinets appeared under Louis XVI, thanks to the improved technology for making larger panes of glass. These included "bibliotheques" or bookcases with glass doors, and "Vitrines", or cabinets with glass doors, where precious objects could be displayed. These had very ornate marquetry patterns on the doors in the earlier years of the reign, but became much simpler, with mahogany and oak trimmed with gilded bronze, in the later years.
Desks.
The basic forms of writing table, the drop-front desk and cylinder desk had all appeared in the furniture of Louis XV, but their appearance became more classical, geometric and sober under Louis XVI, and the quality marquetry inlays became much finer. The writing tables varied in size, but had leather tops, tapering legs, and usually three drawers. The corners were often decorated with gilded brass rosettes or other ornaments. The woods used were generally oak, rosewood and amaranth, sometimes with additional mahogany, boxwood and ebony inlays. Some writing tables had additional shelves that could be pulled out for writing surfaces, and some models and a surface that would lift up at an angle. The "bureau à cylinder", or roll top desk, had been invented by Oeben for Louis XV in 1760. The updated versions by Jean-Henri Riesener, were made of oak covered with mahogany, and had simple but elegant gilded bronze drawer handles, keyholes, and a lacy decorative trim fence around the top.
The "Secretaire an armoire" was a vertical piece of furniture which resembled an armoire. The writing surface was pulled down, and the shelves and drawers inside were reveaed. The "Secretaire en cabinet" also had a writing surface that pulled down, with shelves on either side and drawers beneath. Clocks and other decorative objects could be placed on the marge shelf on top.
The designers who were most celebrated for desks included, besides Jean-Henri Riesener, Jean-Francois Leleu; Claude-Charles Saunier, and particularly David Roentgen, who made desks not only for Louis XVI, but also for Catherine the Great, the King of Prussia and the Emperor of Austria. His desks were famous for the mechanical mechanisms and secret compartments rather than their elegance.
Beds.
In the reign of Louis XVIII, nobles often received visitors while in bed. The official waking-up of the King was a formal ceremony, could be attended by anyone in the palace. and nobles often received visitors while they were in bed. In the bedchambers of the King and Queen, the bed was behind a balustrade, and a row of stools was placed behind the balustrade for guests. 
The beds of the nobility and wealthy were usually square or rectangular, with four high posts supporting a canopy called the "ciel", or sky. The "ciel" could either be fixed to the bedposts, or to the wall. Curtains were usually hung from the "ciel" and could be drawn to enclose the bed. In the 18th century different variants of the canopy appeared. In a bed "a la Duchesse" the canopy covered the entire bed, while in a bed "a l'ange", or "like an angel", the canopy covered only the head of the bed. The head of the bed, with its ornate "chevet" or headboard, was usually placed against the wall.
Several other variants appeared in the 18th century, including the "lit en chair à prêcher", which had a canopy attached to the wall by sloping poles, which resembled the pulpit attached to the wall of a church. A more casual variant, the "lit de jour" or day bed, was midway between a bed and a sofa, with an upholstered chevet or headboard at one end attached to a long cushion with six legs.
The "Lit à la polonaise" (Polish bed), with the ciel suspended directly over the bed, had first appeared under Louis XV, but was simplified and given a classical look under Louis XVI. Marie Antoinette had a version made for the bath of her apartments in Versailles.

Kokomini

The Kokomini ("Gugumini") are reported to have been an indigenous Australian people of the state of Queensland, though some indications suggest the term may refer to a loose confederation of tribal groups.
Name.
The ethnonym Gugumini means "good/intelligible speech". 
Country.
The Gugumini are estimated by Norman Tindale to have had tribal grounds stretching over about along the middle Palmer and Mitchell rivers, extending westwards to the area where the two meet. Their eastern limits were around Mount Mulgrave and Palmerville. Palmer reported their main camp to be at the head of Annie Creek and King River. Ursula McConnel wrote of the area between Wulbur and Yurgo as that of the Koko-mini and Kokowara.
Customs.
The Kokomini were said to have used a concoction drawn from Darwin stringybark leaves as a remedy for fever.
History of contact.
Kokomini territory was occupied by white settlers in 1874. Conflicts ensued as the Kokomini speared livestock introduced for grazing on their land, resulting in war between the two. The war was still ongoing a decade later, with the rule established that the indigenous Kokokmini had no right to be "let in" to their land, and a good many were shot down, putatively in "retaliation" for the loss of cattle and horses. The Queensland politician Edward Palmer ran a station in the area in the 1880s.

Katrín Magnússon

Katrín Sigríður Skúladóttir Magnússon (1858–1932) was an early Icelandic feminist who played an important part in promoting women's voting rights and women's education in the late 19th century. She served as a municipal councillor of Reykjavík from 1908 to 1916.
Biography.
Born on 18 March 1858 on the island of Hrappsey in north-western Iceland, Katrín Sigríður Skúladóttir was the daughter of Skúli Þorvaldsson Sívertsson, a farmer, and his wife Hlíf Jónsdóttir. Raised on Hrappsey, she first went to Reykjavík when she was 14 to visit her paternal aunt, Katrínar Sívertsen. There she met Guðmundur Magnusson, a physician and academic, who was a relative of Katrínar's husband, Jóni Árnasyn. She married Guðmundur in 1891 and they moved to Copenhagen. They returned to Iceland the following year, settling in Sauðárkrókur after her husband received an appointment at the hospital in Skagafjörður. Kartrín was also interested in medical work but the only training open to women was for midwives, which she did not find attractive. She nevertheless constantly helped her husband, sometimes taking care of his patients.
Katrín became active in social affairs, especially in connection with women's organizations. She joined the Icelandic Women's Association ("Íslenska kvenfélag") which she chaired from 1903 to 1924. In 1917, she helped to establish the Women's Alliance ("Bandalags kvenna"). She also served on the board of "Thorvaldsensfélag" (the Thorvaldsen Association), Iceland's oldest women's organization established in 1875. Interested in education, she participated in the school committee at Reyhjavik's "Kvennaskólan" (Women's School). Katrín was one of four women who sat on Reykjavík's municipal council from 1908 to 1916.
Katrín Magnússon died in Reykjavík on 13 July 1932.

Systema Solar

Systema Solar is a Colombian dance music group known for their party-oriented sound, which is influenced by the sound system DJ culture of the Caribbean. Their music combines elements of Afro-Caribbean music, champeta, bullerengue and cumbia, among other genres.
History.
Systema Solar originated in 2006, when DJ Vanessa Gocksch offered to create a band to play at an Art Biennial festival in Medellín, Colombia. Soon afterward, the hastily assembled septet made its debut performance in front of an audience of several thousand people. In 2009, their self-titled album was released, and the following year, it was re-released on Chusma Records. An expanded version of this album was later released by Nacional Records in March 2016, featuring tracks from a previous album they had released in 2013. In 2017, they released the album "Rumbo a Tierra". As of 2017, the group had six members.
Critical reception.
"Rolling Stone" named the 2016 reissue of "Systema Solar" the third best Latin album of 2016, writing, "Vibrant and demanding, the Colombian psychedelic soundsystem champions the causes of immigrants and POC while commanding bystanders to get rowdy on the dance floor."
NPR's Jessica Diaz-Hurtado wrote that "Rumbo a Tierra" "...takes listeners on a colorful and politically urgent journey", describing it as "a protest album that never lets its innovation stand in the way of its forcefulness." Ryan Patrick gave the album an 8 out of 10 rating in "Exclaim!", writing that "Systema Solar bring a "party with a message" mentality that melds future and folk sounds with innovative flair."

La Roche (horse)

La Roche (1897 – 1920) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. As a two-year-old in 1899 she showed some promise, winning once from six attempts, but appeared to be some way below top class. In the following season, when tried over longer distance, she emerged as one of the best horses of her generation in England, winning the Oaks Stakes, Manchester Cup, Yorkshire Oaks and Newmarket Oaks as well as finishing fourth in the 1000 Guineas and third in the Doncaster Cup. She was retired at the end of the season to become a broodmare and had considerable success as a dam of winners.
Background.
La Roche was a small bay mare with no black leg points bred in England by her owner the 6th Duke of Portland. She was trained throughout her racing career by John Porter at his Kingsclere stable in Berkshire. As a three-year-old was described as "very sharp-looking, but not quite big enough for the best company.
She was one of the last notable horses sired by St. Simon, an undefeated racehorse who was considered one of the best British runners of the 19th Century. In an outstanding stud career he won nine sires’ championships, having sired ten Classic winners. Her dam, Miss Mildred showed no ability as a racehorse but was a granddaughter of the influential British broodmare Braxey.
Racing career.
1899: two-year-old season.
On the day of the 1899 Epsom Oaks La Roche ran promisingly in the Acorn Stakes, finishing second to Dum Dum in a thirteen-runner field. La Roche was matched against male opponent in the British Dominion Two-Year-Old Race over five furlongs at Sandown Park on 24 June but after showing good early speed she came home last of the five runners behind Stealaway. She recorded her only victory of the year in September when she won the Prince of Wales's Nursery at Doncaster September. On her final run of the season she ran third in the Osmaston Nursery Plate at Derby Racecourse in November, conceding weight to the first finishers.
1900: three-year-old season.
On 4 May La Roche began her second campaign in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse, starting at odds of 10/7 against ten opponents. Ridden by Mornington Cannon, she ran "very well" to take fourth place behind Winifreda, Inquisitive and Vain Duchess.
At Epsom Racecourse on 1 June La Roche, with Cannon again in the saddle, started the 5/1 third choice in the betting behind Winifreda and Lady Schomberg in a fourteen-runner field for the 122nd running of the Oaks Stakes. The weather was cold and windy and the crowd was unusually small although it included the Prince of Wales. Commenting on his trainee's chances before the race John Porter had said "she will run well, for she is a rare little sticker". 
La Roche was settled in mid-division before making steady progress into third place behind Lady Schomberg and Paigle entering the straight. She took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and drew away to win very easily by three lengths from Merry Gal, with Lady Schomberg coming home a distant third. The Oaks form received a boost on 5 July when Merry Gal scored an upset victory over Diamond Jubilee in the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket.
One week after her Oaks triumph, La Roche followed up by "cantering" to victory under 107 pounds in the valuable Manchester Cup, a handicap race over one and three quarter miles at Manchester Racecourse. La Roche won again at York Racecourse on 28 August, when she "slaughtered" the opposition to take the Yorkshire Oaks from Inquisitive and Vain Duchess at odds of 1/4.
La Roche had never been entered in the St Leger, for which she might well have started favourite, and so was instead matched against older horses in the two and a quarter mile Doncaster Cup on 14 September at the same meeting. Despite carrying a ten pound weight penalty she started 5/6 favourite but after leading into the straight she was overtaken and beaten into third place behind King's Courier and Merry Gal. On her penultimate start of the year she started 1/10 favourite for the two-mile Newmarket Oaks on 9 October and won by eight lengths from her two opponents. For her final run of the season La Roche was assigned top weight of 122 for the Cambridgeshire Handicap over eight and a half furlongs at Newmarket on 24 October. Racing over a much shorter distance than she had attempted since May, she finished unplaced behind the four-year-old colt Berrill.
La Roche earned £8,000 as a three-year-old.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated La Roche an "average" winner of the Oaks.
Breeding record.
After being retired from racing at the end of her second season, La Roche became a broodmare for the Duke of Portland's stud. La Roche was euthanized in 1920. She produced at least eight foals and three winners between 1902 and 1920:

Aldania raddei

Aldania raddei is a butterfly found in the East Palearctic (Amur, Ussuri) that belongs to the browns family.
Description from Seitz.
raddei Brem. (55d) stands entirely apart in facies; a remarkable species, which must be placed in the present genus ["Neptis"] as it agrees with the same in its morphological characters. Moore has erected for its reception a special genus, "Aldania". Ground-colour white, dusted with grey-brown at the margins, the base and along the veins, the veins themselves blackish, a row of dark lunules along the margin, being especially distinct on the underside. — Amurland: Bureja Mts., Ussuri.
Biology.
The larva feeds on "Ulmus propinqua".
Etymology.
The name honours Gustav Radde.

Mary Arabella Stewart, Countess of Galloway

Arabella Stewart, Countess of Galloway (26 April 1850 – 18 August 1903), formerly Lady Mary Arabella Arthur Cecil, was the wife of Alan Stewart, 10th Earl of Galloway.
She was the daughter of James Brownlow William Gascoyne-Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Salisbury, and his second wife, the former Lady Mary Catherine Sackville-West. Her older half-brother, Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, was prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1886 to 1892 and again from 1895 to 1902.
She married the future earl on 25 January 1872, a year before he succeeded to his father's titles. As Lord Garlies, he was Conservative MP for Wigtownshire, thus representing the same party as his brother-in-law. 
There were no children from their marriage. The earl died in 1901, aged 65, and was succeeded in the earldom by his brother Randolph Henry Stewart, 11th Earl of Galloway. A portrait photograph of the countess, taken during the 1870s by John Watkins, is held by London's National Gallery.
The dowager countess had a London house at 17 Upper Grosvenor Street, but died at "Cuffnells", Lyndhurst, Hampshire, of pneumonia, aged 53.

Liñán's diffusion flame theory

Liñán diffusion flame theory is a theory developed by Amable Liñán in 1974 to explain the diffusion flame structure using activation energy asymptotics and Damköhler number asymptotics. Liñán used counterflowing jets of fuel and oxidizer to study the diffusion flame structure, analyzing for the entire range of Damköhler number. His theory predicted four different types of flame structure as follows,
Mathematical description.
The theory is well explained in the simplest possible model. Thus, assuming a one-step irreversible Arrhenius law for the combustion chemistry with constant density and transport properties and with unity Lewis number reactants, the governing equation for the non-dimensional temperature field formula_1 in the stagnation point flow reduces to
where formula_3 is the mixture fraction, formula_4 is the Damköhler number, formula_5 is the activation temperature and the fuel mass fraction and oxidizer mass fraction are scaled with their respective feed stream values, given by
with boundary conditions formula_7. Here, formula_8 is the unburnt temperature profile (frozen solution) and formula_9 is the stoichiometric parameter (mass of oxidizer stream required to burn unit mass of fuel stream). The four regime are analyzed by trying to solve above equations using activation energy asymptotics and Damköhler number asymptotics. The solution to above problem is multi-valued. Treating mixture fraction formula_3 as independent variable reduces the equation to
with boundary conditions formula_12 and formula_13. 
Extinction Damköhler number.
The reduced Damköhler number is defined as follows
where formula_15 and formula_16. The theory predicted an expression for the reduced Damköhler number at which the flame will extinguish, given by
where formula_18.

Aedan (film)

Aedan: Garden of Desire is a 2017 Indian Malayalam film directed by Sanju Surendran. The film stars Abhilash Nair, George Kurian, Prasant, Nandini Sree, Sunny, Jojo George, and Dileep Kumar. "Aedan" is more of a folktale in its elemental qualities and evocation of eternal human passions. Following the tradition of Indian epic narration, the structure of the film is that of a story within a story. The stories attempt a microscopic examination of human nature. As the story courses through the frustrations of the characters, the idyllic landscape of a beautiful Kerala village takes on diabolic dimensions in the night.
The film premiered at the 2017 International Film Festival of Kerala.
Synopsis.
The thread of the story is from the three short stories of S Hareesh - 'Niryatharayi', 'Manthrikavaalu', and 'Chappathile Kolapathakam'.
Awards.
The film has received the following honors:

FCM 1A

The FCM 1A was French heavy tank that served as a prototype of the Char 2C.
Development.
The FCM 1A began development in January 1917 when 200 hp engines became available. Trials were planned to start at the beginning of May after the first prototype began construction in April. However, after the failed Nivelle Offensive, the first operation where French tanks were used, all French tank development was halted. After a reversal of that decision, development was repeatedly delayed due to multiple problems.
Testing began on 20 November 1917 after six months of delays. The vehicle was the largest tank built up to that point, measuring long. The hull was extremely elongated in order to cross the trenches of the Western Front. The tank originally had a crew of 7, but the crew was reduced to 6 in December. The main armament was a shortened version of the Canon de 105 Court Schneider with a large ammunition capacity of 122 rounds.
It had a Renault 220 hp engine, allowing a maximum speed of and a minimum speed of . The suspension consisted of bogies, sprung by leaf springs, of four wheels. The tank could cross a gap and overcome a gap.
Mobility tests showed issues with the tank’s tracks and with the engine overheating, but mobility was deemed unsatisfactory. Firing tests conducted between 5 - 7 February 1918 also had satisfactory results.

Margaret of Sicily, Countess Palatine of the Rhine

Margaret of Sicily or Margherita di Sicilia-Aragona (1331 in Palermo – 1377 in Neustadt) was a Sicilian princess, daughter of the King Frederick III of Sicily and his wife Eleanor of Anjou. In 1348 she married Rudolf II, Count Palatine of the Rhine, and was Countess Palatine of the Rhine until 1353, year of the husband's death.
Life.
Margaret was the youngest daughter of King Frederick II of Sicily-Aragon (1272-1337) and his wife Eleanore, daughter of Charles II of Anjou. Her parents resided in Palermo, where she presumably was born.
In 1348 Margaret married the widowed Count Palatine Rudolf II from the house of Wittelsbach, who lived in Neustadt an der Weinstraße.
In 1349 Rudolf II married his daughter from his first marriage, Anna von der Pfalz, to King Charles IV, one of the most important rulers of the late Middle Ages. Anna died in Prague in 1353. Count Rudolf finally retired because of increasing illness, and handed the government business over to his brother and successor Ruprecht, who in 1356 was able to acquire the Electorate for the Palatinate. Rudolf II was nicknamed "the blind", because he had a serious eye disease and was blind in his last year of life.
The marriage of Rudolf II and Margaret of Sicily-Aragon remained childless.
Elizabeth of Portugal (1271-1336), Margaret's father's sister, is revered as a saint. Her mother's brother, Louis of Toulouse, is also one of the saints of the Catholic Church.
Death and commemoration.
Pfalzgraf Rudolf II decreed that the church of Saint Ägidius (Giles) in Neustadt should be converted into a "memoria"—a place of prayer and commemoration—for the Wittelsbachs, and wished to be buried there.
After his death on October 4, 1353, he was buried according to his wishes in front of the altar of the Neustadt parish church of St. Giles.
In 1356 Elector Ruprecht I donated the Liebfrauen-Kollegiatstift Neustadt as memorial for his family, according to the will of his brother Rudolf II. He had the parish church of St. Ägidius rebuilt and extended to the east with a splendid choir. The chancel area of this new church, the present Neustadt collegiate church, was built in 1368 according to a column inscription.
The altar of the new church now moved a good way east and the square in front of the altar of the old parish church, where Rudolf II had been buried, was now at the transition from the nave to the new choir area. At this point, in 1377, the Countess Margaret of Sicily-Aragon was buried next to her husband Rudolf II. She had survived him by 24 years.
Margaret of Sicily-Aragon received a splendid Gothic epitaph. Because of her royal origin, she is depicted on it with a crown. The gravestone is now located on the far north wall of the catholic church area and is one of the sights in Neustadt. Her husband Rudolf II possessed a similarly ornate grave plate, which, however, has survived only badly damaged and is also located in the Catholic church section on the rear south wall, opposite to his wife.
The graves of Count Palatine Rudolf and Countess Margaret of Sicily-Aragon lie in the rear of the Catholic part of the church, about the center, but are split by the 1707/1708 dividing wall between the Protestant nave and Catholic choir. In 1906 they were opened and re-covered with modern stone slabs, but not marked in the floor.
Around 1910, city pastor Michael Glaser (1863-1915) erected four large statues of the Palatine rulers Rudolf II and Ruprecht I, and the women buried by their side Beatrix of Berg and Margaret of Sicily-Aragon. They were created by the Munich sculptor Hubert Netzer from white Kelheim limestone and are located on the northern and southern nave wall of the Catholic part of the church. The sculptures, in the historicist style, are modeled on ancient representations. The two statues of women and the figure of Count Palatine Rudolf II are based on the images on their epitaphs in the collegiate church.

Think About You (Delta Goodrem song)

 
 
"Think About You" is a song by Australian singer-songwriter Delta Goodrem. It was released on 16 February 2018. The song debuted on the ARIA singles chart at number 32, and later peaked at number 19, becoming Goodrem's 21st top 20 hit in Australia.
Upon release, Goodrem said: "As a songwriter, I look at the message that I want to convey in a song, in this case, and after working on a number of different projects, I genuinely went into the writing session with an open mind that it didn't have to come with as much gravity in the sentiment, it just has to feel good. Every chapter of my career has been different and right now, with this song, I want people to just have fun."
Promotion.
The song was teased over the course of several days across Goodrem's social media accounts, with snippets of the song being paired with scenes of Goodrem moving around at a photoshoot. Goodrem also did a performance as part of Channel V's Island Parties series to promote the song. She also did a series of radio interviews on all the major commercial stations around Australia.
Reception.
Jamie Velevski from Amnplify said "The upbeat, seductive track puts the songstress into a new spotlight as the use of sensual sounds and soft tones throughout the background are characteristics unseen to the artists' previous work." Adding that "with the team that put together Niall Horan's global hit "Slow Hands", there's no denying that this fresh mature sound for Delta will also make waves." Mike Wass from Idolator called the song "a sexy, uptempo banger."
Music video.
On February 16, Goodrem uploaded a video titled "Think About You (The Look Book)" to her Vevo page. It features monochrome footage of her at the photo shoot which produced the cover art for the single. As of 10 November 2019, the video has more than 711, 000 views.
Another music video was filmed in early 2018. Goodrem teased the video on her Instagram with a dance rehearsal video. The video was eventually scrapped for unknown reasons.

Vermontville Opera House

The Vermontville Opera House is an auditorium located at 120 East First Street in Vermontville, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.
History.
Vermontville was first settled in 1836; it slowly developed, and in 1871 was incorporated into a village. At some point before 1881, an opera house was constructed in the village, and was owned by a succession of local residents until it burned in the mid-1890s. In 1895, the Vermontville Township purchased this plot of land and began construction of the opera house on the site, with the cornerstone laid on August 27. The building was completed in 1896.
The auditorium was well-used for dances, lectures, plays, musical performances, and vaudeville over the next several decades. The first story of the opera house originally housed office and meeting spaces for Vermontville Township and Village, along with the village's fire apparatus at the rear of the building. In 1948, the Vermontville Library took over the former village council rooms. In 1973, the fire department moved out and the library expanded; the building itself was renovated by infilling the former fire house doors.. As of 2018, the building still housed both the library and the Township offices.
Description.
The Vermontville Opera House is a rectangular three-story structure with walls faced in concrete block in the first story and red brick above. The building has a mansard roof and a foundation of rock-face fieldstone ashlar. Window bays are separated by slightly projecting piers, which stretch upward to the cornice line. The windows have segmental arches and cut stone sills and caps with prominent keystones. The cornice is or pressed metal. A square tower at one corner has a bell-shaped roof and paired windows with store trim. On the main facade are two entrances: a single door in the center leading into the first story, and an entrance in the tower leading to the auditorium at the second floor level. 
The building contains a first floor originally housing offices and the fire department, and now houses the library. The upper floors housing a level-floor auditorium with rear gallery. The auditorium is entered through a lobby, where a ticket office is also located. The auditorium itself is a two-story high space, flat in the center and sloping around the perimeter. A small stage is at the front, and a balcony at the rear above the lobby.

Boys' Club of Pittsburgh

The Boys' Club of Pittsburgh is a historic building in the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Built in 1912 as the Lawrenceville YMCA, the three-story building was designed by local architect Robert Trimble and originally included a gymnasium, swimming pool, bowling alley, and dormitories. In 1928 the building was sold to the Pittsburgh Boys' Club, which became part of the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America. The Boys &amp; Girls Club continued to use the building until 2000, when a new facility was completed two blocks away. Subsequently, the older building was occupied by a charter school until 2014 and then converted into apartments. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.

DR-WebSpyder

DR-WebSpyder is a DOS web browser, mail client and operating system runtime environment that was developed by Caldera UK in 1997. It was based on the DR-DOS operating system and networking components from Novell as well as the Arachne web browser by Michal Polák of xChaos software. The system was designed to run on low-end desktop systems, but being able to boot and execute from disk as well as from ROM or network, it was also tailored for x86-based thin clients and embedded systems with or without disk drives. Using the web browser as its principal user interface, it could be also used for kiosk systems and set-top boxes. Named Embrowser, it has been ported to Linux in 1999 and was called Embedix Browser since 2000.
NIOS and IOS.
DR-WebSpyder was originally conceived as project NIOS (Novell Internet Operating System) at Novell's European Development Centre (EDC), UK in 1994 by then DR-DOS engineer Roger Alan Gross, who was working on Novell's Embedded Systems Technology (NEST) initiative to create embedded system applications that connect intelligent devices to NetWare networks. NIOS was conceived as a thin client operating system that provided Novell with a graphical client operating system to run web applications hosted on NetWare, creating a Novell-centric platform for software as a service (SaaS) that did not require Microsoft's Windows operating system. NIOS comprised 32-bit versions of Novell's existing 16-bit DOS technologies including the DR-DOS operating system, Novell's modem dialer and TCP/IP stack from LAN Workplace for DOS / NetWare Mobile plus licensed third-party components such as the Kaffe Java virtual machine (JVM), Allegro for graphics, and Mosaic for the web browser.
WebSpyder, WebSpyder 32 and DR-WebSpyder.
Gross's plans were interrupted when Caldera, Inc. acquired the remaining Digital Research assets including DR-DOS from Novell on 23 July 1996, but without the personnel. Gross telephoned Caldera's Ransom H. Love the same day offering to set up a new DR-DOS team outside of Novell. Gross subsequently joined Caldera as general manager of the Digital Research Systems Group (DSG) in December that year and set about rehiring the DRDOS/NIOS team in the UK to develop the new operating system and web browser. Under Caldera, NIOS was renamed IOS (Internet Operating System). The plan to use Mosaic was also dropped and instead Caldera licensed the source code of the 16-bit DOS web browser Arachne. The team replaced Arachne's dialer and packet drivers with Novell's dialer, ODI driver suite (from Personal NetWare etc.) and TCP/IP stack, added support for animated and scaled GIFs, an optional on-screen keyboard for mouse and touch panel usage (SoftKeyboards) for possible keyboardless operation, and an install program. Also, they completely changed the design of the browser (customizable chrome), implemented support for NetScape-compatible frames, and used Allegro for graphics. The browser also supported "execute links" to run and interact with DOS programs and batchjobs run on the web client, a feature originally introduced as DOS Gateway Interface (DGI) in Arachne. IOS became formally known as WebSpyder in May 1997. Some months later, it was ported to compile as a 32-bit protected mode extended DOS application (utilizing DPMI using DJGPP, a GNU compiler for DOS), then referred to as WebSpyder 32, but renamed DR-WebSpyder in early 1998.
On 11 May 1998, Caldera started shipping DR-WebSpyder 2.0 as both a HTML 3.2 web browser application and browser OS. On 1 June 1998, the company opened a sales and support office in Taiwan to be close to potential OEM customers.
A maintenance release DR-WebSpyder 2.0a was issued on 19 August 1998.
Caldera distributed a free demo version of DR-WebSpyder 2.0a on a bootable fully self-contained 3.5-inch floppy. This was in fact the DR-WebSpyder OS configured as loosely coupled components in which a special version of the DR-DOS ANSI.SYS driver would mute the stream of text messages at startup of the DOS system while a graphical company logo was displayed until the web browser was launched as a shell via CONFIG.SYS SHELL replacing the default COMMAND.COM command line interpreter. On 386 PCs with a minimum of 4 MB of RAM, the floppy would boot the DR-DOS 7.02 based browser operating system complete with memory manager, RAM disk, dial-up modem, LAN, mouse and display drivers and automatically launch into the graphical browser, without ever touching the machine's hard disk in order not to interfere with other systems installed on the machine and to demonstrate its potential usage in diskless workstations. Users could start browsing the web or accessing mails immediately after entering their access credentials. A further refined international revision of the demo by Matthias R. Paul utilized more sophisticated multi-level compression to free enough space on the floppy image to also include menu options and additional drivers to choose between several languages and keyboard layouts and give room for further expansion or customization of the operation system and browser through OEMs or users.
On 2 September 1998, it was announced that the Digital Research Systems Group and consequently also Caldera UK was spun out as a separate company Caldera Thin Clients (CTC), incorporated earlier in August 1998.
In September 1998, DR-WebSpyder 2.0 achieved commercial success when it was selected for use in an internet set-top box as part of a satellite internet access solution.
On 3 November 1998, the company announced DR-WebSpyder 2.1. With DR-WebSpyder 2.1 Beta 2 being available since 7 November 1998, the browser was released on 30 November 1998. It added support for JavaScript, the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, cookies, sound files, printing on a multitude of printers as well as user profiles and support for multiple mail accounts. It also added scrollable quarter-screen VGA support for low-resolution LCD displays as well as anti-aliased fonts for display on TVs in an optional TV interface mode.
Caldera UK also investigated possibilities to add Java and JVM support to the browser, but this component never left prototype status. Two desired prerequisites for Java integration were to add support for long filenames (LFNs) and Unicode to DOS. Caldera's DPMS-enabled dynamically loadable LONGNAME driver provided VFAT-compatible LFNs in the FAT file system utilizing UCS-2 internally. Matthias R. Paul conducted research how to achieve this with minimal changes to the existing system and to not cause bloat to an operating system also tailored for thin clients and embedded systems. Expanded DRFONT-style .CPI files could have been provided to retrieve bitmaps for the required larger character repertoire (Basic Multilingual Plane) not only to support a lot more code pages in general, but also wider character sets similar to what was used in DOS/V-compatible systems. In conjunction with a new COUNTRY.SYS file, Paul's enhanced NLSFUNC 4.xx driver, which was introduced with DR-DOS 7.02, could have provided the framework to integrate optional UTF-8 support into the system in a way similar to DBCS support.
When Gross resigned in January 1999, Caldera Thin Clients, Inc. closed the Caldera UK Ltd. development office in February 1999 soon after the release of DR-DOS 7.03.
Embrowser and Embedix Browser.
On 20 July 1999, Caldera Thin Clients renamed itself into Lineo under the new lead of Bryan Wayne Sparks. DR-WebSpyder was renamed Embrowser and the browser was said to be ported to Linux.
A version of DR-WebSpyder for IMS REAL/32, a successor to Digital Research's and Novell's Multiuser DOS, has been worked on in 1999 as well.
Since October 1999, a DOS version of DR-WebSpyder 2.5 aka Embrowser 2.5 was available on Lineo's site.
Since Lineo's own thin-client Linux distribution was named Embedix, the Linux port of the micro web browser was consequently named Embedix Browser by April 2000.
In April 2002, some Lineo assets were auctioned off and the company reformed as Embedix, Inc. by July 2002 under the lead of Matthew R. Harris. Motorola's Metrowerks bought Embedix key assets, possibly including the browser, on 17 December 2002.

Jen Lindley

Jennifer "Jen" Lindley is a fictional character and one of the lead roles from the WB television drama "Dawson's Creek", portrayed by Michelle Williams.
Fictional biography.
Background.
Jennifer "Jen" Lindley grew up in New York, the only child of Theodore Lindley and Helen Ryan with whom she does not have a close relationship. Caught up in the city life of sex and drugs, at the age of 15, her parents sent her to live with her conservative Christian grandmother Evelyn Ryan (whom she calls "Grams") in Capeside. They often clash due to their differences but, as the series progresses, Grams loosens up and becomes more tolerant and loving. Jen quickly becomes close friends with Dawson and Pacey. She has a more complicated friendship with Joey, but through the course of the series they become good friends. In the episode "Boyfriend", which takes place approximately three months into her sophomore school year, Lindley says she is sixteen years old. This would make her a year older than the three other main cast members.
Season 1.
Jen was introduced to the show in the pilot episode when she arrived from New York City to live with her grandmother in Capeside, after her parents realized just how out of control she was. Jen initially provided a love interest for Dawson and the two casually dated throughout the first season, which caused tension between Jen and Joey Potter, Dawson's childhood friend and crush. However Jen and Dawson broke up when Jen's ex-boyfriend Billy came to Capeside to win her back and he revealed some of Jen's sordid past. In the heat of the moment, Dawson basically called Jen a slut. By the end of the season she began regretting her decision to break up with Dawson and wanted him back, especially as her sick grandfather died.
Season 2.
After Jen broke up with Dawson, she became somewhat isolated from the rest of the main characters for much of the second season, especially with Joey as she and Dawson had begun dating. Because of this, Jen became close friends with Abby Morgan, a bitchy girl who everyone disliked, and they often drank and partied together, much to Grams' dismay. They fell out for a short while when they both dated a sailor who had docked at Capeside. During her sophomore year, Jen also briefly dated a conservative Christian, but broke up with him after he was revealed to be a homophobe (this came out while gay rumors were circulating about Jen's friend Jack McPhee.) She later re-befriended Abby who died shortly again from after falling off a pier while drunk, and it sent Jen into a depressive downward spiral. Grams kicked Jen out of the house due to her behaviour so she briefly stayed with the Leery's before she attempted a reconciliation with her parents, but they again rejected her. Jen then went to live with Jack, but eventually they decided they could not afford to live by themselves, and so Jack and Jen moved back in with Grams.
Season 3.
While Jack moved out to live with Andie again, his relationship with Jen remained close. She attended cheerleader tryouts purely to denounce the extremely unpleasant head cheerleader, and she was also elected homecoming queen. Jen was courted by Capeside High's star freshman quarterback, Henry Parker and the two dated throughout most of Jen's junior year. Jen later entered a purely sexual "friends with benefits" relationship with Pacey; both agreed that there will be no emotion involved whatsoever. Pacey and Jen are nearly caught having sex in Dawson's room after he returns home from an appointment; he finds a condom on his bedroom floor and is suspicious about who Pacey is seeing. The gang later discover Pacey and Jen kissing. Joey overreacts and Jen suspects she likes Pacey, and Pacey and Jen decide their fling is not working and they are better off as friends. During the third season, Jen's mother unexpectedly shows up at Grams' house for Thanksgiving dinner. Jen is not happy to see her mother, especially when she discovers she has a half-sister Eve Whitman (who Dawson dated for a while).
Season 4.
Jen's senior year comprised much of the fourth season. Jen broke up with Henry who had left school for a football scholarship. She became closer with Jack after the break-up and the two almost shared a drunken sexual encounter on the school ski trip. One of Jen's old acquaintances from her days on the New York party scene, Drue Valentine, moved to Capeside to live with his mother, and brought an unhappy reminder of her past. Before a rave one night, he offered her ecstasy, which Jen accepted from him but never took. Instead, a depressed Andie took the drug, which mixed with her medication caused her to gain a high fever and end up in hospital. This caused a massive rift between Jen and the rest of her friends, which was only healed after Andie told them that she was leaving for Italy. While her friends were all applying to colleges, Jen was reluctant to do so; Jack, with Grams' help, eventually applied to several schools for her, using previous school work for the essays. Though she considers returning to New York for school, she decides to go to Boston with Jack instead. Jen also met Toby, an admittedly gay teen whom Jack finds strongly unattractive. However, Jen gets along with Toby and soon learns that he has a "thing" for Jack. After he makes it perfectly clear that he does not wish to take Toby to the gang's senior prom, Jen goes against Jack's wishes and tells Toby that Jack wants to ask him out. Jack gets even by setting Jen up with her old drug buddy, Drue as her prom date. While Jen and Drue seemingly reunite, Jen confesses to her old friend that she has changed her mind about attending college in New York.
In the season finale, Grams sells the house and decides to move to Boston with Jen and Jack.
Season 5.
The fifth season, which spanned Jen's freshman year in college, was somewhat tumultuous. Grams moved to Boston with Jen and Jack and the three lived together until Jack joined a fraternity, which (coupled with the alcohol abuse and academic decline it coincided with) created a rift in his relationship with Jen. While at Boston Bay Jen briefly dated musician Charlie and ran a school radio show, However she found out that Charlie was cheating on her and she comically made him confess---with the help of Charlie's other girlfriend Nora, Jen convinces Charlie to "shut-up and get naked" just before locking him out of his dorm room in a hallway full of students. After the death of Mitch Leery, Dawson invites Jen to attend the Hookset Film Festival in New Hampshire after he learns that his father entered him in the competition, using his film about now-deceased-director A.I. Brooks. Dawson wins first place, and jokingly thanks "his girlfriend Jen Lindley". After losing his virginity to her, Dawson dives into a serious fast-paced relationship with Jen, but she breaks it off after realizing that it was the wrong thing to do.
During the gang's spring break trip to Florida, Jen finds Joey spending some quality time with her ex-boyfriend Charlie Todd. In trying to warn her, Jen's advice goes unheeded by Joey. In the meantime, Jen tries to have a serious conversation with Jack about his drinking problem.
At the end of the season, Jack relays to Jen that he has passed all of his classes, and the two friends prepare to take a vacation to Costa Rica. However, an unexpected phone call from Jen's parents in New York, ruin their plans. At first, Jen decides to spend the summer with her best friend, but when everyone collides at the airport in the finale, Dawson convinces Jen to go see her parents. She takes the next flight out to New York as Grams sneaks to Vegas with her boyfriend, Cliffton Smalls. Jen runs into "Damage Ink" director, Todd Carr, on the plane; the same director who fired Dawson from his internship at USC.
Season 6.
During the sixth season, Jen embarked on a relationship with C.J. who she met at a campus cafe. Jack convinced her to call the helpline where C.J. worked to invite him to a Halloween party, but she forgot to mention to him that it was a costume party after he and his friend, David, show up in casual dress.
Joey's roommate Audrey, ends up sleeping with C.J. when she gets drunk before a gig with Emma's band at Hell's Kitchen. Jen learns of C.J.'s sexual misadventures only after he tells her that he no longer dates. Upset, Jen leaves the situation, while C.J. gets into a fist fight with Pacey during a No Doubt concert.
In the meantime, Grams is diagnosed with breast cancer and decides not to tell Jen. When Grams gives in and tells Jen of her illness, Jen retaliates by dumping C.J. before they have to host a Loveliness Questionnaire with Drew Pinsky and Adam Carolla. When the pressure gets to be too much, Jen gives the hosting job to an ecstatic Audrey. Towards the end of the season, Jen calls on her mother Helen to talk things out with Grams, and initially so Grams can tell her own daughter about the cancer. Eventually, Grams' boyfriend, Bill Braxton (also C.J.'s uncle) breaks the ice and tells Grams that she cannot give up the fight. Grams, Jen, and Jack decide to move to New York to live with Jen's mother while Grams undergoes treatment.
Series finale.
In the two-part series finale, set in 2008, the gang learns of Jen's fatal heart condition, pulmonary congestion, after she faints during Gale Leery's second wedding. Jen, now the single mother of a one-year-old daughter, Amy, ends up hospitalized and reveals to Jack, her best friend, that there is nothing to be done to save her. Leaving Amy in Jack's care, Jen dies with Grams at her side on May 14, 2008.
Reception.
First introduced as the outsider coming to the small town and shaking Dawson and Joey's relationship, Jen becomes one of the most compelling and strong characters in the show. Creator Kevin Williamson said about Williams. "I remember when Michelle Williams walked in and auditioned for Jen. I had always envisioned her as the girl from the wrong side of the creek who at 15 comes to the creek with a checkered past and disrupts its flow. When she came in — she auditioned with when Jen goes in and sees her grandfather laying in the bed — she got really quiet and just sat there for a really long time as if this grandfather was sitting in front of her. She played it as if she were really broken. I saw Jen as this fallen angel, a broken bird, and Michelle tapped into that. She transformed herself into this broken child who just needed to be fixed. I knew I'd found Jen Lindley." "The Guardian" said "She was enigmatic, but also damaged and vulnerable."
There is a lot of criticism surrounding Jen's death on the series finale. Jen was regularly slut shamed through the course of the series, especially by Dawson who mistreats her after he learns she is no longer a virgin. Finally, she is killed off in the last episode leaving a baby daughter to her best friend, Jack, to raise. Many considered it a tragic ending to a character who was mistreated during the entire run of the series. "Vulture" said "we're repeatedly told via slut-shaming dialogue that Jen is a seductress or a 'barracuda,' but she walks like she's been on horseback for three days, in concrete panties — and the writers never did quite figure out what to do with the character, sending Jen on a series of downward-spiral arcs that landed like wet toilet paper."
In "Grazia"s article "Dawson's Creek, Jen Lindley, And The Betrayal Of The Noughties Bad Girl" it is discussed the misogynist aspect of her arc, saying "Are you a woman in Noughties television? Do you like to party? Enjoy a drink? Use recreational drugs? Like to rattle the headboard on occasion? You must be punished. While your male peers can screw up constantly, and the girl-next-door in your peer group can wander through life doe-eyed and unharmed, you're pretty much doomed. Jen was never going to survive Dawson's Creek. Even becoming a mother couldn't save her." Williamson comments on the decision saying "she always felt like the outsider, the misfit" and "she was always the person who didn't feel like she fit in. And I thought what a beautiful way to let her be the catalyst for everyone's turning events." Her death mostly serves to Dawson to grow up and to Pacey and Joey to finally declare their love for each other.
Williams, who was a 16-year-old teenager when "Dawson's Creek" started, had her first major role in the series. "Vulture" said "you can see glimmers of Williams's potential". To "The New York Times" she was an earnest performer at the age of 16. She received two nominations to the YoungStar Award for Best Performance by a Young Actress in a Drama TV Series.
Williams' thoughts on "Dawson's Creek".
In 2018, "Entertainment Weekly" organized a "Dawson's Creek" reunion with the original cast to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the series. In the occasion, Williams appeared on two covers of the magazine, one with Katie Holmes, James Van Der Beek and Joshua Jackson her fellow lead actors and the other with Busy Philipps, her best friend whom she met on the set of the show. Williams' declared "I loved that we were able to get in there in those formative years for people. That's why people, I think, are so connected to it. When something affects you while you were growing up, it kind of stays in there forever. When you're so permeable and open and trying to figure out who you are and what's going on, whatever reaches you in those moments really becomes part of you." She also spoke about the fact people still talk to her about how Jen and Jack are a huge cultural reference on best friends.
In 2019, during a "Variety"s interview with Patricia Clarkson while promoting her first television work in years, Fosse/Verdon, Williams said about her experience in "Dawson's Creek" "It was a very different kind of television. We did 22 episodes a year, you'd be getting scripts sort of at the last minute and you had like zero input" and "That was hard, it was a little bit like a factory job. It was formulaic."

Eleonora degli Albizzi

Eleonora degli Albizzi (1543 – 19 March 1634) was a mistress of Cosimo I de' Medici, the Granduke of Tuscany. She bore him an illegitimate son, Don Giovanni de' Medici.
History.
She was the daughter of an ancient Florentine family of moderate means, daughter of Luigi degli Albizzi and Nannina Soderini. With the consent of her father, by 1565, at the age of about 23–24 years, she became the mistress of the Granduke, who was a widower since the death of Eleonora of Toledo in 1562. In 1566, Albizzi bore the Duke a daughter who soon died as an infant. In 1567, she bore him the son Giovanni.
Rumors began to circulate that Cosimo wish to legitimize his union to Eleonora. Tradition holds that his long-time chamberlain Sforza Almeni of Perugia shared the Duke's desires with Francesco I, the legitimate heir who was increasingly the dominant force in the government. Francesco, likely worried about the entry of potential heirs and a mother-in-law, scolded his father about those plans. Thereupon, seized by rage because his secret desires had been revealed, on May 22, 1566, the Granduke is said to personally stabbed his chamberlain to death. This event, along with others episodes such as the rumored murder of Filippo Strozzi the Younger, reinforced a perception that Cosimo was possessed of an excessively passionate, if not bloodthirsty, ruthlessness.
The love affair between Cosimo and Eleonora quickly cooled, and by 1567 she was forced to marry the dishonored nobleman Carlo Panciatichi. Cosimo meanwhile latched on to an affair with another young woman, Camilla Martelli. Panchiato had faced execution for rebellion, and was herewith pardoned and granted a reward of 10 thousand scudi to take Eleonora. It is unclear what role his legitimate children played in arranging to remove Albizzi from the Grand Duke's orbit.
Eleonora had three children with Carlo, including Bartolomeo (born 1577). However, in 1578, she was accused of adultery and confined to the Monastery of Fuligno. She lived at the monastery for the last 56 years of her life.

Fedora Alemán

Fedora Alemán (11 October 1912 – 6 February 2018) was a Venezuelan operatic soprano. One of Venezuela's most celebrated singers, she performed in concert halls throughout Latin America and Europe.
Early life, education and family.
Born in Caracas on 11 October 1912, Alemán began to play the piano when she was six. Her vocal talents were recognized from an early age, especially when she reached her teens. She studied at the Escuela de Música y Declamación in Caracas before training in New York under Fausto Cleva and, in particular, Alfredo Hollander in Caracas.
In her early twenties, Alemán married the American cellist Mario Di Polo whom she met in New York when she was 22. They remained married until he died in 1975. The couple had three children: Reinaldo, a scientific researcher; Mario, a violinist, and Frank, a trumpeter.
Career.
Her first recording, on the RCA Victor label, was made in New York while her first public performance was in 1936 at Caracas's Teatro Municipal. It was also here she sang her first opera, Pergolesi's "La serva padrona". She went on to perform leading roles in Verdi's "Rigoletto" and "La Traviata".
From 1950, her concert tours reached North America, Brazil and Europe. She performed in the United States, in Rio de Janeiro, and in 1951 in the Caribbean. In 1954, she participated in the "Primar Festival de Música Latinoamericana de Caracas" (First Caracas Festival of Latin American Music), with "Bachianas Brasileñas" by Heitor Villa-Lobos. In 1956, she sang Lucy from the opera of Gian Carlo Menotti: "The Telephone, or L'Amour à trois". In 1961, she travelled to France and Italy where she undertook further voice training. The following year she performed at the Grand Théâtre in Bordeaux.
After appearances in Nice and Paris, she traveled in 1964 to Israel, where she appeared in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The following year, she sang the world premiere of "Cuatro canciones sefardíes" by Joaquín Rodrigo at the Ateneo de Madrid and in the auditorium of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. In 1971, she received the first prize in the "Certosa Festival" in Italy. In 1974, she was elected Woman of the Year in Venezuela. In 1977 she received the "National Music Award ", and in 1992 the Andrés Bello award. The Simón Bolívar University called her "a pioneer of lyrical singing in Venezuela". She was a music teacher from 2006, with a doctorate honoris causa.
Celebrated Venezuelan and foreign composers have created works for Alemán. These include "Por los caminos de Zorca y Petrea" by Blanca Estrella de Méscoli, "La renuncia" by Antonio Estévez, "Vuelas al fin" by Moisés Moleiro, "Canción a Fedora" by José Reina, "Giraluna lejana" by Inocente Carreño, "Alma no me digas nada" by Ana Mercedes Asuaje de Rugeles and "Pájaro del agua" by Joaquín Rodrigo.
After retiring from the stage in 1989, together with the Venezuelan soprano Lotty Ipinza, she founded the Taller de Técnica Vocal Fedora Alemán in Caracas, initially aimed at aspiring singers with limited resources and currently to stimulate the participation of young people attracted to singing.
The critic Ana Mercedes Asuaje de Rugeles (1914-2012) commented: 
She died on 6 February 2018, of natural causes, at the age of 105.
Recognition and awards.
Alemán was named "Mujer de Venezuela" (Woman of Venezuela) in 1974. She has also received the "Orden de la Ciudad de Caracas" (Order of the City of Caracas), the "Orden Andrés Bello" and the "Orden Río Branco". A music centre in central Caracas bears her name while the Fedora Alemán medal is awarded for lyrical excellence in the Venezuelan National Singing Contest.

Argynnis anadyomene

Argynnis anadyomene is a butterfly found in the East Palearctic (Amur, Ussuri, China, Korea) that belongs to the browns family. 
Description from Seitz.
A. anadyomene Fldr. (= ella Brem., midas Btlr.) (70d, 71b, c). At once recognizable by the peculiar shape of the hindwing , the costa is nearly straight, being almost without a trace of curvature. Above like "laodice", leather-yellow, evenly dotted with black, the female bearing a white spot before the apex. The hindwing beneath is shaded with silvery grey, having a strong metallic green gloss and being without the distinct silver bands of "paphia". Throughout Eastern Asia; first described from China, but also occurring in Tibet, Amurland, Corea and Japan, ab. "crassipunctata" Fruhst. are specimens with larger spots above, which occur among the otherwise very constant nymolypical form (Leech). — Specimens from the island of Tsushima Fruhstorfer names "prasoides"; the subapical spots on the forewing above of the male are smaller than in specimens from China and Japan; in the female the basal area of the upperside is more abundantly dusted with light green and the hindwing beneath has a deeper sea-green tinge. — The species is very abundant in most localities in the warmer districts of Eastern Asia, but does not appear to go very far north; though being still plentiful on Askold, it is according to Graeser already rare near Wladiwostock, which is hardly further north. They fly somewhat later than "sagana"; in October I still found worn males and numerous females together with true autumnal species such as "Vanessa glauconia", species of "Catocala" and "Arhopala". They closely resemble on the wing the dark "paphia" female occurring there.

Kasselburg

The Kasselburg is a ruined hill castle on a 490-metre-high basalt massif in Pelm near Gerolstein in the county of Vulkaneifel in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate.
Description.
The symbol of the Kasselburg is its 37-metre-high, double tower, which functioned as a gate tower and tower house, whose origins are not precisely clear. Hitherto it had been assumed that the lords of Blankenheim had built it shortly after 1335, but structural investigations have shown that the tower underwent several phases of construction and cannot just be the work of one architect. The gate probably lost its guarding function with the expansion of the castle from 1452. It is from that period that the large outer bailey, with its "burgmann" houses and domestic buildings, dates.
The double tower is open to the public and has a good view of the surrounding area but, despite its size, is not a "bergfried" (fighting tower). The latter, built around 1200, is smaller and stands in the eastern part of the inner bailey. It has a square ground plan and was turned into a tower house in the 14th century.
Also part of the inner ward is the almost 33-metre-long "palas", which dates to the 14th century.
History.
The castle was built in the 12th century. Its owners may have been the lords of Castel, but this is not entirely certain. The castle was first mentioned in 1291 as the "Castilburg". In 1314, it is called "Castelberch".
According to the current state of research, it is not clear who the owner of the castle was before 1335. However, it is certain that Gerhard V of Blankenheim became its owner following a division of inheritance in that year and thus founded the Blankenheim-Kasselburg line. In 1406, this line of Blankenheims, which had been elevated to the countship, died out with Count Gerhard VII. The castle then passed by marriage to William I of Loen and thus to Heinsberg.
Other owners followed, including the counts of the Mark, dukes of Arenberg and prince-electors of Trier. Many interest groups have claimed the Kasselburg for themselves throughout history, so that in 1674 the Imperial Chamber Court of Wetzlar was called upon to put an end to the property disputes. When the judges awarded the castle to the dukes of Arenberg, the buildings soon served as barracks for the Duke of Arenberg's artillery. This marked the beginning of the decline of the castle: in the 18th century it was still temporarily the seat of an Arenberg forester, but by 1744 it was described as dilapidated.
After France seized the castle in 1794, it went to the Prussia in 1815. An impulse to rescue the ruin came unexpectedly from King Frederick William IV in 1838. After a visit he initiated repair work, and after the completion of the railway line from Cologne to Trier, the railway company donated 1,000 talers to open up the then already famous double tower in order to "offer its passengers something".
At the beginning of the 20th century, the state historic preservation authorities carried out further restoration. The Castle Administration of Rhineland-Palatinate, who took over Kasselburg in 1946, also had conservation measures carried out. In the meantime, the site has been placed under the care of the Directorate for Castles, Palaces and Ancient Monuments of the General Directorate for Cultural Heritage Rhineland-Palatinate, since 1998 the successors to the former Castle Administration.

Brachybacterium huguangmaarense

Brachybacterium huguangmaarense is a species of Gram positive, strictly aerobic, orange-pigmented bacterium. The cells are coccoid during the stationary phase, and irregular rods during the exponential phase. It was first isolated from a lake sediment sample from Huguangyan Maar Lake collected in Zhanjiang, Guangdong Province, China. The species was first described in 2014, and the name is derived from the location from which the organism was first isolated.
The optimum growth temperature for "B. huguangmaarense" is 28-30 °C, but can grow in the 18-40 °C range. The optimum pH is 7.0-8.0, and can grow in pH 4.0-8.0.

Michel-Philippe Bouvart

Michel-Philippe Bouvart (Chartres, 11 January 1717 – Paris, 19 January 1787) was a French medical doctor.
He was made a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1743 and a professor in the Paris Faculty of Medicine in 1745 and also in the Collège Royal in 1745, where he took the medical chair previously held by Pierre-Jean Burette. Louis XV granted him letters of nobility and the Order of St. Michael in 1768 or 1769.
Bouvart was famous for his quick diagnoses and accurate prognoses, but also for his caustic wit and polemical writing against his fellow physicians, notably Théodore Tronchin, Théophile de Bordeu, Exupère Joseph Bertin, Antoine Petit. He was opposed to inoculation against smallpox. He championed Virginia polygala or Seneka as a remedy for snakebite.
Although he was able and learned, he is perhaps best known for his witticisms.
Witticisms.
Variants of Bouvart's quip about the placebo effect of using a new treatment or medicine "while it still works" are often quoted without crediting him.
A "regular prelate" (prélat régulier) is a high-ranking churchman; this is a play on words, implying that he was irregular, that is, immoral. Abbot Terray is Joseph Marie Terray.
This story has been compared to Euricius Cordus's epigram:
Early life.
Bouvart's father Claude was a physician. Michel-Philippe received his medical degree in Reims in 1730 and practiced in Chartres. In 1736, he left for Paris.

Mariya Shcherbachenko

Mariya Zakharovna Shcherbachenko (, ; 14 February 1922 – 23 November 2016) was a medic in the Red Army during World War II, referred to by the Soviets as the Great Patriotic War. For being one of the first 13 soldiers to cross the Dnieper she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 23 October 1943.
Prewar life.
Shcherbachenko was born on 14 February 1922 to a Ukrainian peasant family in the village of Yefremovka (Ukrainian: Yefremivka) in the Kharkov Governorate. Her older brother Andrey raised her after the death of both of their parents. Upon graduating from secondary school she worked as an accountant's assistant on a collective farm in her village.
World War II.
Shcherbachenko hid during the German occupation of her village to avoid being deported and forced to conduct hard labor. Soviet troops expelled German forces from Yefremovka in February 1943, after which she worked in the construction of defensive structures on the Donets river until joining the Red Army in March. She then underwent medical training in Samarkand before she was deployed as part of the 835th Rifle Regiment in July.
On 24 September 1943 she was one of the first 13 soldiers to reach the right bank of the Dnieper River, doing so under heavy enemy fire in the village of Grebeni in the Kyiv oblast. Throughout ten days of intense battle she rescued 112 injured soldiers from the battlefield, providing first aid and transporting them back across the river to a medical center. In the beginning of the offensive she operated a machine gun in battle. On 23 October 1943 she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet for her actions in the Dnieper battle. After receiving the title she continued to serve on the frontlines until being recalled from the front in May 1944 to give a speech at the 3rd Youth Anti-Fascist Rally in Moscow. After speaking at the rally she was sent to study at the Kharkov Military Medical School, which had been relocated to Ashgabat, Turkmenistan due to the war; however, she did not graduate from the school.
Postwar.
After the war she left the military. She then graduated from Tashkent Law School and worked as a lawyer in Kyiv. For her dedication to rescuing the wounded in battle she was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal by the International Red Cross in 1973. She died in Kyiv on 23 November 2016 at the age of 94 and was buried in the Kyiv Lukyanivske Military Cemetery.

Plasmodium brasilianum

Plasmodium brasilianum is a parasite that infects many species of platyrrhine monkeys in South and Central America.
Description.
Sequence analysis of circumsporozoite protein, merozoite surface protein-1, and small subunit ribosomal RNA of "P. malariae" and "P. brasilianum" showed that the two parasites were very closely related. It is considered plausible that "P. brasilianum" in platyrrhines is a result of the cross-species transfer of "P. malariae" brought to the New World by settlers in the post-Columbus era. As "P. malariae" and "P. brasilianum" have now been demonstrated to be genetically identical based on 18S rRNA sequences, it has been proposed that "P. brasilianum" be subsumed under the name "P. malariae".
Distribution.
"Plasmodium brasilianum" naturally infects species of primates from all New World monkey families from a large geographic area in Central and South America. The parasite has been found in Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and French Guiana.
Hosts.
Natural infection of "P. brasilianum" has been found in tamarins and marmosets of the genera "Callithrix", "Leontopithecus" and "Mico" in the Atlantic forest. Also "Anopheles freeborni" mosquitoes infected by feeding on a platyrrhine spider monkey ("Ateles geoffroyi geoffroyi") from Panama carrying "P. brasilianum", have been shown to transmit the parasite through biting to five human volunteers. In addition to humans, "P. brasilianum" has been transmissible experimentally to marmosets.

Fascinator (album)

Fascinator is the eighth studio album by Czech black metal band Master's Hammer. It was released on 10 February 2018 through their own label, Jihosound Records, and is available in vinyl, CD and cassette formats.
It is their first release since "Vracejte konve na místo." to count with the participation of guitarist Petr "Blackie" Hošek (a former member of another important Czech black metal band, Root) as an official member, their first one since "Mantras" with former timpani player Honza "Silenthell" Přibyl, and the first one overall with new bassist Petr "Rámus" Mecák.
Two tracks of the album, "Ve věži ticha" and "Estetika ďábla", were uploaded to vocalist Franta Štorm's official YouTube channel as teasers on 11 September and 22 November 2017, respectively.
Štorm claims on the album's liner notes that most of its writing process were inspired by trips he took to Goa, India (a common destination for him), and Norway (Master's Hammer performed at a festival in Bergen in 2017). "Linkola" is a tribute to the Finnish philosopher Pentti Linkola.
Track 11's title is in Portuguese.
Critical reception.
The album was positively reviewed upon its release. "MetalReviews.com", giving it a grade of 85/100, praised its "eerie atmosphere", calling it a "weird and theatrical" album and comparing it favorably to the sonority of Japanese band Sigh. "Metal Invader" rated it with a 4.5 out of 6, comparing Master's Hammer to American band Psychotic Waltz and saying the album was a huge improvement over the "rather mediocre" "Formulæ".

1-Diazidocarbamoyl-5-azidotetrazole

1-Diazidocarbamoyl-5-azidotetrazole, often informally referred to as azidoazide azide, is a heterocyclic inorganic compound with the formula C2N14. It is an extremely sensitive explosive.
Synthesis.
1-Diazidocarbamoyl-5-azidotetrazole was produced by diazotizing triaminoguanidinium chloride with sodium nitrite in ultra-purified water. Another synthesis uses a metathesis reaction between isocyanogen tetrabromide in acetone and aqueous sodium azide. This first forms isocyanogen tetraazide, the "open" isomer of C2N14, while quickly cyclizes under standard conditions to form a tetrazole ring.
Properties.
The C2N14 molecule is a monocyclic tetrazole with three azide groups with a molecular weight of 220.16 g.mol-1. It has a molecular equilibrium between a closed and an open form, isocyanogen tetraazide which has been known since 1961, the latter being quickly cyclized to the cyclic tetrazole form (C2N14) at room temperature.
It is one of a family of high energy nitrogen compounds in which the nitrogen atoms do not have strong triple bonds. This conformation is less stable, making the compounds liable to explosive decomposition releasing nitrogen gas. 
This tetrazole explosive has a decomposition temperature of 124°C. It is very sensitive, with impact sensitivity lower than 0.25 Joules. Decomposition can be initiated by contact or using a laser beam. Despite some exaggerated claims, C2N14 is not the world's most sensitive compound; there are other contact explosives such as nitrogen triiodide which are much more sensitive.

Li Osborne

Li Osborne (née Luisa Friedericke Susanna Wolf; 4 January 1883 - 19 August 1968), also known as Louise Hutchinson, was a German-born, later British, portrait and figure photographer and sculptor in bronze and terracotta.
Biography.
Osborne was born in Mayence, later Mainz, and was educated in Freiburg, Geneva and London. Her mother was Bavarian and her father was a naturalised British subject. In 1920 Osborne had her first photographic exhibition in Copenhagen. Between 1922 and 1924 she operated a portrait studio in Baden-Baden and in 1925 she located the studio to Giselastraße 1, in Munich. In this time she also made theater-photography. In 1925 Osborne became a member of the "Gesellschaft Deutscher Lichtbildner", Society of German Photographers. Her portrait subjects included Jean Arp, Albert Schweitzer and a production of King Lear in a style tinged with expressionism. In 1934 Osborne sold her studio and emigrated to Switzerland. During World War II, in Zurich, she began to teach herself sculpture. Although largely self-taught as a sculptor, she received advice from many internationally known artists, while living in Switzerland.
In 1945 Osborne moved to East Bergholt in England and dedicated her time to sculpture. Her sculptures were based on figuration and expressiveness and she often left traces of her working of the material in the finished piece, in contrast to the smooth abstract work of others. In 1953 and 1956 works by her were shown at the Beaux-Arts Gallery, London.

NASA marijuana experiments hoax

The NASA marijuana experiments is a 2016–2018 internet hoax purporting to document NASA's payment of $18,000 to volunteers to conduct bed rest experiments where they were furnished with marijuana to smoke during the experiment. NASA confirms that bed rest experiments were conducted, but never involved marijuana. Facebook refuted the viral story as part of its efforts to combat fake news.
The hoax may have been spun from a real 2014 news story by "VICE" columnist Andrew Iwanicki in which he documented his experience as a NASA bed-rest test subject.

Hemidactylus boavistensis

Hemidactylus boavistensis, the Boa Vista leaf-toed gecko, is a species of gecko in the family Gekkonidae. The species is endemic to the Cape Verde Islands. The specific name, "boavistensis", refers to the island Boa Vista, one of the islands where it has been found. It has also been found on the island Sal and the islets of Curral Velho and Sal Rei. It had long been considered a subspecies of "Hemidactylus bouvieri" but was re-elevated as a separate species in 2008.
The Boa Vista leaf-toed gecko reaches lengths of from snout to vent. The head is relatively broad and the snout narrow with a concave or straight profile on the dorsal surface. It has about 35–38 fine ventral scales across the mid-belly. The first hind toe typically has 5 scales underneath while the fourth toe has 7–9 scales. In comparison, "H. bouvieri" is smaller, up to from snout to vent, with a narrower head, 20–25 coarse ventral scales, and only 3–4 scales under the first hind toe and 4–5 under the fourth.
Although it is common where it is found, it was listed as a "near threatened" species on the IUCN Red List in 2012 due to its limited distribution, pressures from development, and competition with introduced species such as the house gecko ("Hemidactylus angulatus").

Messer (band)

 Messer is an American hard rock musical ensemble from Dallas, Texas. Started in 2009, the ensemble has released three singles, including "Simple Man", "Whiskey" and "Make This Life" in addition to their self-titled debut studio album.
History.
Beginnings (2009–2013).
During lead vocalist Dereak Messer's high-school career in Iowa, he performed with local bands. After high school, the singer moved to Dallas to engage in a professional music career. Upon Dereak's move to the lone star state, he met Javier Contreras, who performed in bands named Mudflap and Pimpadelic. When looking for a hair stylist, Dereak serendipitously waltzed into bassist Maddox Messer's Hair salon, at which time they began to talk about music. During drummer Kenny Youngar's drive from Canada to Arizona, his automobile malfunctioned near Dallas. Youngar ended up spending the night, and joined a band named Strangleweed (who made an appearance on "Eye for an Eye"). After the band heard about this, Kenny was invited to join the group. Following the formation of the quartet, tattoo artist Donnie DeVille and the ensemble exchanged music after which time DeVille rounded out the quintet.
While touring with a multitude of notable music ensembles, the group caught the eye of music producer Chad Gendason, who produced the debut album from the group.
Self-titled debut album and "Make This Life Tour" (2013–2018).
In 2013, the group released two singles entitled "Whisky" and "Simple Man". Just under five years later, in January 2018, the ensemble released "Make This Life", the debut single from their self-titled album. In early April 2018, "Make This Life" peaked at Number 28 on "Billboard" Mainstream Rock Songs.
In March and April 2018, the ensemble toured with Lacey Sturm, Red and Righteous Vendetta.
On April 20, 2018, the group released via MaddPants Records their self-titled debut studio album, produced by Chad Gendason.
In June 2018, the quintet travelled the southwestern United States in support of their "Make This Life Tour", with three July stops in Texas to perform on the 2018 Vans Warped Tour.
On August 7, 2018, the band released their music video for "Save Myself", the second single from their self-titled album. In late August 2018, the group plans to perform throughout the United States with American heavy metal band Gemini Syndrome.
In October and November 2018, the group toured with American rock bands Royal Bliss and Joyous Wolf.
In January 2019, the ensemble filmed their music video for "Simple Man", one of the two first singles from their debut album. In April 2019, the group plans to perform multiple shows with Pop Evil and Memphis May Fire, followed by a mid 2019 United States tour with Scott Stapp of American rock band Creed.
Critical reception.
Regarding "Make This Life", Megan Buck of "Shockwave Magazine" stated that: "This fist-raising single will get your head nodding long before it’s finished" and that it "provides 
a vivid and infectious sound that leaves you in high anticipation of the album to follow". Buck goes on to state that the tune is a "kick-starter of a single" that "draws you in with a little ‘unce-unce’, reminiscent of Nine Inch Nails, however, the similarities end when the first verse lands". The author continues indicating that the two aforementioned songs "are the anathema-tic attention grabbers".

Omek Tannou

Omek tannou, Oumouk tangou or Amuk taniqu is an ancient Tunisian rainmaking ritual which was inherited from Punic and Berber traditions involving invocations of the goddess Tanit. It is now all but extinct.
It features the ritual use of the sculpted head of a woman (somewhat resembling the head of a girl's doll), which is carried in procession between the houses of a village during periods of drought by children singing the refrain (transliteration: "amuk taniqu ya nisa' talabat rabiy ealishata'a")
"Oumouk tango, O women, ask God to rain". This song varies according to the region because the term " chta " designates rain only in certain urban areas. Each housewife then pours a little water on the statuette believing that it will bring rain.
In some villages, instead of the "doll's head", a stick is used - to which each woman attaches a piece of clothing before giving some Barley to the children in the procession, who then move off, while singing the refrain &lt;br&gt;(transliteration: "ya bu qatmibu 'aetayna shaeir yamalaa qadahkum malghdir)&lt;br&gt; 
"O Bouktambou [deformation of "Omouk tangou"] give us barley, your container will be filled from the water sources".

Glasgow and West of Scotland Association for Women's Suffrage

The Glasgow and West of Scotland Association for Women’s Suffrage was an organisation involved in campaigning for women’s suffrage, based in Glasgow, with members from all over the west of Scotland.
Formation.
The association met for the first time in 1902, in the home of founding president Mrs Greig, at 18 Lynedoch Crescent, Glasgow. Further meetings (until 1909) were held in the offices of the Scottish Council for Women's Trades at 58 Renfield Street. Greig was, for many years president of the Glasgow Women's Liberal Association, and, along with fellow members Alice McLaren, Elizabeth Margaret Pace, Grace Paterson &amp; Margaret Irwin was also a member of the GCWT.
Activities.
The organisation is considered to be a non-militant suffrage association. Their methods of influence included drawing-room meetings, addressed by prominent male and female suffragists, as well as networking with other organisations, such as The Primrose League, West of Scotland Women's Liberal Unionist Association, Scottish Women's Liberal Federation, Glasgow Council for Women's Trades &amp; British Women's Temperance Association.
The close links between the Glasgow Council for Women's Trades have been noted by Elspeth King: "There is no doubt that the Suffrage Society of 1902 was essentially the child of the Scottish Council for Women's Trades. The frenetic attempts of the executive committee to persuade the Countess of Aberdeen, Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair to accept the presidency was due to the fact that she had been President of the parent body since its inception, and President of the International Council of Women since 1893." The countess was unable to accept the presidency, presumably owing to her workload.
Elspeth King notes that the social status of the members was a key driver of their activities. " [It] helped to attract the support of a succession of Liberal Lord Provosts and Town Councillors, and Members of Parliament."
From the earliest days, members of the organisation travelled throughout the West of Scotland, addressing meetings and facilitating the setting up of branches of the organisation, in places such as Greenock, Motherwell and Kilmacolm, the latter in cooperation with the Kilmacolm Women's Liberal Association. They also took their campaign with them as they travelled doon the watter to the Clyde coastal resorts, such as Helensburgh, Troon, Saltcoats, Dunoon and Rothesay. A branch of the association was established in Greenock, in 1904.
In November 1907, a deputation met with the Prime Minister, Lloyd George at the North British Station Hotel. "He was asked by Mrs Hunter for a pledge that the Government would bring in a women's suffrage Bill before this Parliament came to the end of its career."
During the war, the organisation suspended political campaigning, running a series of lectures instead. In the advertisements, they identified themselves as "non-party, non-militant" and "law-abiding", in order to distinguish themselves from the more militant groups, such as the Women's Social and Political Union.
Evolution.
After the Representation of the People Act 1918 was passed, the Association quickly moved on to promoting women candidates in local government elections. The Women's Local Representation Joint Committee was formed of a number of different organisations with similar aims. These were the Voters' Council, the Women's Educational Union, the Glasgow Women's Citizens' Association, a body formed by members of the Women's Freedom League, the National Council of Women, and the Glasgow Society for Women's Suffrage. It was chaired by Mary Anderson Snodgrass who would go on to be a Town Councillor and Bailie of the city of Glasgow. This coalition of organisations had the role of a pressure group, promoting legislation favourable to women.
In 1933, the societies were dissolved for financial reason; however, the women continued to meet in Queen Margaret Union at University of Glasgow until the 1960s.

Caesar (1810 ship)

Caesar was launched in 1810 on the Thames River. She sailed first as a West Indiaman, and then after 1814 to the East Indies under a license from the British East India Company (EIC). In 1817 she repatriated from Batavia to London Lord William Amherst and the offices and crew of . "Caesar" was last listed in 1825.
Career.
"Caesar" enters "Lloyd's Register" in 1810 with J. Fowler, master, Fowler &amp; Co., owner, and trade London–Jamaica. Captain Jonathon Fowler acquired a letter of marque on 10 November 1810.
On 13 October 1812 Captain James Shand acquired a letter of marque. "Lloyd's Register" for 1813 shows "Caesar"s master changing from Fowler to Shand. In 1814 M. Fowler replaced J. Shand.
The "Register of Shipping" for 1816 shows "Caesar"s master changing from Shand to Taylor, her owner from Fowlgen to C.H. Turner, and her trade from London–Jamaica to Bombay. The EIC had lost its monopoly on the trade between England and India and "Caesar" acquired a licence from the EIC to trade with India. Captain J. Taylor sailed from England in December 1816, bound for Fort William, India.
In 1817 Lord Amherst was returning on from his embassy to China. On 18 February "Alceste" grounded on one of the many hidden reefs in the Java Sea. She was wrecked, and first Lord Amherst and his party, and then the rest of "Alceste"s officers and crew reached Batavia. Lord Amherst then engaged "Caesar", which was at Batavia, to take all the survivors back to England.
"Caesar" sailed on 17 April with Lord Amherst, his party, and the officers and men of "Alceste". Several events marked the voyage. (Different sources give inconsistent dates for arrival and departure dates for "Caesar"s stops on her way home.)
On 5 May, while "Caesar" was about 200 miles south of Mauritius a fire broke out in the spirit room. "Aceste" men. especially her gunner, were instrumental in putting it out. "Caesar" arrived at Simon's Bay on 27 May.
"Caesar" sailed again in company with for St Helena on 11 June. Before leaving Batavia, "Caesar" had also loaded two unusual passengers, an orangutan and a python. Several accounts of the voyage mention the feeding of the python, and its dissection after its death on the way to St Helena. The orangutan eventually had free run of the ship and arrived safely in England.
"Caesar" arrived at St Helena on 27 June. On 28 June Lord Amherst, Captain Maxwell of "Alceste", and Mr. Lynn, her surgeon, met with Napoleon Bonaparte. They reported an amicable discussion.
On 29 June, or 3 July, "Caesar" left St Helena. She arrived at Ascension Island on 7 July. She stayed less than a day, stopping only long enough to load eight large turtles. "Caesar" arrived at Spithead on 16 August.
Fate.
"Caesar" continued to trade with the East Indies on her return from repatriating Lord Amherst and the crew of "Alceste". She was last listed in the "Register of Shipping" in 1824, and in "Lloyd's Register" in 1825 with J. Taylor, master, Taylor, owner, and trade London–Bengal.
It is highly likely that in 1826 she became .

Juan Alberto Fuentes

Juan Alberto Fuentes Knight is a Guatemalan economist, politician, and non-profit official. Among other roles, he has served as Minister of Finance in Guatemala and as chairman of Oxfam International.
Fuentes is the son of Alberto Fuentes Mohr. He studied economics at McGill University and the University of Toronto, and received his PhD from the University of Sussex. Fuentes has held positions with the United Nations in Costa Rica, Mexico, Chile, and Guatemala. He was founder and director of the Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies (ICEFI), the first think tank of its kind in the region.
From 2008 to 2010, Fuentes served as Minister of Finance in Guatemala. In this role, he steered the country's finances through the turbulent Great Recession, implementing moderate countercyclical policies to soften the impact of the global economic downturn. He also created a vice ministry dedicated to transparency in use of public funds. Alongside other initiatives, this new vice ministry spurred significant improvement in Guatemala's standing in the International Transparency Ranking, as the country moved up by 12 spots. After his time in office, Fuentes authored a popular book, "Rendición de Cuentas" ("For Accountability"), detailing his experiences while leading the Ministry.
Fuentes resigned as Minister of Finance in 2010, citing anomalies in the use of public funds and inability to pass a progressive fiscal reform. He went on to serve as Regional Advisor of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) in Mexico City. He then worked as Director of the Division of Economic Development at ECLAC in Santiago, Chile, where he conducted research on macroeconomic challenges and fiscal reform in Latin America and the Caribbean. Following this role, he taught courses in Economics at Universidad Rafael Landívar in Guatemala City, served as an independent consultant on economic integration and political economy, and participated in the organization of a new Guatemalan political initiative called Semilla.
On 13 February 2018, Fuentes was detained, alongside all other members of President Álvaro Colom's Cabinet, as part of a corruption investigation dating back to his time in government. The legal process is ongoing and he has not been convicted of any charges. He resigned the same day as president of Oxfam International. Upon his resignation, Oxfam International's executive director, Winnie Byanyima, issued the following statement: “Oxfam does not yet know the nature of formal charges, if any, against Dr. Fuentes Knight. However, he has been entirely open with his Oxfam board and executive that he has been among former officials being investigated as part of a budgetary transaction made by the Guatemalan government while he was finance minister. He has assured us that he has cooperated fully with the investigation in the confidence he did not knowingly transgress rules or procedures.”

Alice Cliff Scatcherd

Alice Cliff Scatcherd (1842–1906) was an early British suffragist who in 1889 founded the Women's Franchise League, with Harriet McIlquham, Ursula Bright, Emmeline Pankhurst, Richard Pankhurst and Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy.
Scatcherd was born in Wortley and was a lifelong campaigner for women's rights who lived much of her life in Morley, West Yorkshire including in Morley Hall. 
Suffragist career.
She was secretary for the Leeds branch of the National Society for Women's Suffrage (NSWS).
Scatcherd was active in speaking out at events in the 1870s as typified by an example on 24 March 1877, when she appeared alongside Lydia Becker and other early suffragettes to discuss women's access to the vote in Macclesfield. The chairman, J. W. White, addressed the meeting saying that "it appeared somewhat strange that whereas the British Parliament had been engaged from time to time for many years back in conferring rights and removing disabilities, there should still exist any large and intelligent section of society outside the electoral community. They had not yet found any good reason given for excluding from parliamentary suffrage women who had already voted in municipal and school board elections; therefore they intended to reiterate their demands until they were conceded". Scatcherd was supported by Henry Birchenough in seconding the first resolution which was moved by Joshua Oldfield Nicholson.
The Alice Cliff Scatcherd scrapbook (SCAT B SCA) comprises letters, photographs and letterpress relating to the national suffrage campaign, politics, education and Morley civic life and is held at Leeds Central Library.
Family.
Alice Cliff was born in 1842 to Joseph and Alice Cliff. According to the 1851 census the family lived in Wortley, Leeds and Scatcherd had three brothers and three sisters. Alice Cliff married Oliver Scatcherd on 3 October 1871 in Morley. He was a solicitor and lived in Morley House at the time of his marriage. Scatcherd was critical of the existing nature of marriage and refused to attend wedding services in established churches where women took a vow of obedience to men. She is said to have shocked late 19th Century conservative society by travelling Europe with her husband without a wedding ring.
Scatcherd is buried in the Scatcherd Mausoleum in St Mary in the Wood churchyard, Morley.

Russian interference in the 2018 United States elections

The United States Intelligence Community concluded in early 2018 that the Russian government was continuing the interfence it started during the 2016 elections and was attempting to influence the 2018 United States mid-term elections by generating discord through social media. Primaries for candidates of parties began in some states in March and would continue through September. The leaders of intelligence agencies have noted that Russia is spreading disinformation through fake social media accounts in order to divide American society and foster anti-Americanism.
Timeline.
February.
In February 2018 Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats claimed during a congressional testimony that "the United States is under attack" from Russian authorities. As of February 13, 2018, six US intelligence agencies unanimously assessed that Russian hackers are scanning American electoral systems and using bot armies to promote partisan causes on social media. Previously, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also warned that Russia is interfering in the 2018 midterm election.
In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on February 13, Coats noted that voting in some elections will begin as early as March 2018 for primaries. He stated: "We need to inform the American public that this is real, that this is going to happen." At the same hearing, CIA Director Mike Pompeo told the committee that Russia has already been observed engaging in such tactics.
March.
During a press conference in the White House on March 6, 2018, President Trump was questioned on the topic of possible interference in the upcoming midterm election, responding “We won’t allow that to happen. We’re doing a very, very deep study, and we’re coming out with, I think, some very strong suggestions on the ’18 election," adding, “we’ll counteract whatever they do.”
April.
The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) discovers that the email accounts of four senior officials have been hacked and monitored for months by a probable foreign agent. The hack is kept secret, even from the GOP leadership, until the NRCC is contacted for a December story by "Politico".
April 23, 2018, saw a report of a possible Russian hack of the website for State Senate candidate Kendall Scudder, a Dallas Democrat candidate. The hack attempted to redirect visitors to another site, and included text in Russian. The incident was reported to the FBI. 
May.
On May 23, 2018, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a committee hearing, warned that the US government was not protected from Russian interference in the 2018 midterms elections, saying, "No responsible government official would ever state that they have done enough to forestall any attack on the United States of America".
July.
On July 10, 2018, the Utah State Elections Director Justin Lee reported that the registration database in Utah recorded a huge uptick in hack attempts, upwards of one billion attempts per day (12,000/second) were seen after Mitt Romney announced his return to campaign for the Senate. Romney's views of Russia as the United States' "biggest geopolitical threat," were widely panned in the 2012 US presidential campaign, but mark him as one of few outspoken Republican opponents of Russian threats.
A July 15 Business Insider article revealed a new Russian intelligence-linked "news" site, USAReally, which follows in the footsteps of previous Russian IRA-backed troll farms, and appears to be an attempt to "test the waters" ahead of the mid-terms.
On July 17, commentator David A. Love said that the WalkAway social media campaign, originally created by New York resident Brandon Straka, had been co-opted by Russian bots in an attempt to discourage Democrats from voting in the mid-term elections, citing Hamilton 68. He cited the #WalkAway hashtag as an example of astroturfing.
On July 20, Microsoft VP for Customer Security and Trust revealed at the Aspen Security Forum in Aspen, Colorado that Russian hackers had already specifically targeted three Congressional candidates running in the 2018 mid-term elections, using sophisticated spearphishing techniques spoofing a Microsoft website.
On July 26, Missouri's Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill revealed that Russian hackers attempted to break into her Senate email account unsuccessfully, confirming a report in The Daily Beast.
On July 31, Facebook announced they had detected and removed 32 pages and fake accounts being used for "coordinated inauthentic behavior," and was "working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other intelligence agencies".
August.
On August 2, 2018, the Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats announced along with FBI Director Christopher A. Wray at a White House press conference that Russia is actively interfering in the 2018 elections, saying "It is real. It is ongoing." At the same time, NPR reported that Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen reported to the FBI several attempts to compromise her campaign including both spearphishing attempts on her staff, and a disturbing incident where someone called her offices "impersonating a Latvian official, trying to set up a meeting to talk to me about Russian sanctions and about Ukraine." Her opposition to Russian aggression and support of sanctions has placed her on an official Russian blacklist.
On August 6, Democratic candidate Tabitha Isner, running for Alabama's 2nd congressional district, reported 1,300+ unsuccessful attempts to break into her campaign website from Russian sourced IP addresses, mostly happening between July 17–18, prompting additional website security measures.
On August 8, Florida Senator Bill Nelson told the "Tampa Bay Times" that Russian operatives have penetrated some of Florida's election systems ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. "They have already penetrated certain counties in the state and they now have free rein to move about," Nelson told the newspaper. He also stated that more detailed information is classified. The Russian hackers may be able to prevent some voters from casting votes by removing people from the voter rolls.
October.
On October 19, the Department of Justice charged Russian accountant Elena Khusyaynova with attempting to interfere with the midterm elections. She was involved with handling the money for Internet Research Agency and related entities who had previously been charged with interfering in the 2016 elections.
November.
On November 6, the 2018 US midterm elections took place.
December.
On December 4, "Politico" reports that the email accounts of four senior officials at the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) were hacked and monitored for months by a probable foreign agent. The hack was kept secret by the NRCC, even from the GOP leadership, until it was contacted by "Politico" for their story.
On December 22, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats reported that there was no evidence of vote tampering, but influence operations had persisted. "The activity we did see was consistent with what we shared in the weeks leading up to the election. Russia, and other foreign countries, including China and Iran, conducted influence activities and messaging campaigns targeted at the United States to promote their strategic interests."

2004 UK &amp; Ireland Greyhound Racing Year

The 2004 UK &amp; Ireland Greyhound Racing Year was the 79th year of greyhound racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
Summary.
Irish racing was experiencing promising growth with increased prize money for competitions including the richest ever prize for a marathon event when the Corn Cuchulainn offered €50,000 for the winner at Harold's Cross.
The situation in Britain was not as simple after Richard Caborn, the Minister for Sport announced that it had been agreed that the bookmakers levy fund would increase to 0.5% in 2004, 0.55% in 2005 and 0.6% in 2006 and therefore doubling the sports income to £16 million within the three years. However the statement was incorrect because a 0.1% increase after three years would mean only a one sixth increase (16.6%). The promise turned out to be false because the levy fund actually decreased significantly over the next five years.
Droopys Scholes won the 2004 English Greyhound Derby and Like A Shot won the 2004 Irish Greyhound Derby. Charlie Lister won the Greyhound Trainer of the Year and Derby finalist, Arc, East Anglian Derby and Oxfordshire Gold Cup winner Fire Height Dan won the Greyhound of the Year.
Tracks.
Coventry opened under new management after an 18-year absence.
Competitions.
English Derby champion Farloe Verdict won the Scottish Greyhound Derby setting a new track record in the final. Brian Clemenson claimed his third successive Trainers Championship at Coventry. A brindle bitch called Roxholme Girl won the St Leger and the Gold Collar, the latter in a new track record time at the competition's new home of Belle Vue Stadium.

Beatrice S. Levy

Beatrice Sophia Steinfeld Levy (April 3, 1892 - July 19, 1974) was an American printmaker and painter, draftsman, and instructor.
Early life and education.
She was born in Chicago to a German-Jewish emigrant father and a mother from Kentucky and grew up on Chicago's Near South Side. She studied at the Chicago Art Institute after graduating from high school in 1910 with an initial focus on illustration. While there, she was among a small number of students including Stanislaus Szukalski who defended the modernist works on display at the notorious Armory Show at the Art Institute in 1913. Encouraged by her instructors she continued her art education after graduating in 1910 with honorable mention, studying portraiture with Ralph Clarkson in Chicago, painting with Charles Hawthorne in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and fine print methods with Vojtěch Preissig in New York's Art Students League in 1915.
Career.
By then, she was already a prolific painter and printmaker, producing striking images with saturated color and abbreviated, semi-realist imagery. One of the earliest members of the Chicago Society of Etchers, her exacting, three-plate color intaglios were first exhibited by the Society in 1914. The same year, one of her prints received an honorable mention at Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco.
She held her first solo exhibition in 1916 at Goupil &amp; Cie Gallery in New York, featured her entire collection of color aquatints. She had a studio in Chicago's 57th Street Art Colony.
In the 1920s she helped form an "art for art's sake" group called the Cor Ardens along with Szukalski, Carl Hoeckner, Ramon Shiva, and Gerrit Sinclair. Traveling with friends all over the United States, Europe, and Mexico, she was by then well-known for "forceful painting in oils, but also for her ability to express in the exquisite art of the copper plate … an individual style through a simple and dignified treatment of her subject matter." (Palos Journal, May 1929)
During the Great Depression (1929-39), Levy supervised the Easel Painting Division and Art Gallery of the Illinois Art Project of the WPA. She also supervised the Easel Painting Division for the Federal Arts Project a decade later.
For two years during World War II, Levy worked as a meteorological map draftsman and her subsequent work developed along more modern lines.
She traveled extensively in the US, Europe, and North Africa and summered La Jolla, California for several years before making it her home in 1950. She served on the board of the San Diego Museum of Art (then the San Diego Fine Arts Gallery) and taught at the La Jolla Museum School of Arts and Crafts (1961–62). Also at the time, she began a close relationship with the modernist artist Dorothy Stratton King, a La Jolla resident with whom she shared a passion for rich color and strong form.
Levy experimented heavily in her final decade in linear and highly abstract printmaking and enamels.
Levy never married. After a long and distinguished career, she died in La Jolla in 1974. Her papers are held by the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.

Xavier Duval

Xavier "Zav" Duval is a fictional character from the BBC medical drama "Holby City", played by actor Marcus Griffiths. He first appeared in the series twenty episode "Hard Day's Night", broadcast on 20 February 2018. Xavier arrives at Holby City hospital to work as a doctor and surgeon on the Acute assessment unit (AAU). Xavier is characterised as a "very confident and charming" doctor who sometimes lacks empathy. He is the show's "alpha male" and upon his arrival, this attitude irritates other characters. Xavier has a "flash" sense of style and Griffiths likened him to a "Milan catwalk model" rather than a doctor.
Xavier wants fun and dislikes the idea of settling down. In line with his characterisation, Xavier formed a casual relationship with F1 Meena Chowdhury (Salma Hoque). He was later paired with senior staff nurse Donna Jackson (Jaye Jacobs), which developed into a serious relationship. Griffiths later remarked that Donna became Xavier's "lighthouse" who helped him resolve his issues and become a better person. Griffiths became worried that Xavier would be forever portrayed as an "entitled brat". He requested that producers create a backstory for Xavier and introduce friends and family. Writers obliged, creating an unlikely friendship with hospital porter Jason Haynes (Jules Robertson) and introduced his entire family, including his mother Nanette Duval (Suzette Llewellyn), who suffers from bipolar disorder.
Griffiths left the series after two years. His final story featured a feud with CT1 Cameron Dunn (Nic Jackman). Xavier sets out to prove Cameron left surgeon Evan Crowhurst (Jack Ryder) to die in his care. Cameron ruins Xavier's career and he is killed after being hit by a bicycle and sustaining a fatal head injury. Xavier's final appearance occurred in the fourteenth episode of series 22, which was broadcast on 14 April 2020. The character was well received by critics of the genre, due to his charming persona and appearance. His departure and death were branded "shocking" and "biggest twist" of the series by various journalists.
Casting.
When Griffiths successfully auditioned for the role of Xavier he had little experience working on television, having previously opted for theatre work. He described joining a long-running series as "new terrain" and stated that he was "loving" his new role. The character first appeared in the series twenty episode "Hard Day's Night", broadcast on 20 February 2018.
In April 2018, Griffiths starred in one episode of "Holby City" sister show, "Casualty", as Xavier. Griffiths made another appearance in the show as part of a two-part crossover episode, originally broadcast in March 2019.
Development.
Characterisation.
Xavier is characterised as an "attractive and charming" doctor who has a "rakish devil-may-care attitude". This attitude makes Xavier struggle to make friends, but once they see his "charm and exuberance" they become more inclined to get acquainted. He is also described as having a penchant for "mansplaining and manspreading" but he would not label himself as a sexist. He likes "competent woman" but his charming attitude usually come with short-term relationships. When he arrives at the hospital Xavier wants to have fun because he is not ready to settle down with someone.
Griffiths told Laura-Jayne Tyler from "Inside Soap" that upon his introduction, Xavier is portrayed as a "very confident and charming". He displays the typical qualities of an "alpha male" which he believed "rubs people up the wrong way." Writers demonstrated this in his early scenes as Xavier's attitude causes tension with consultant Serena Campbell (Catherine Russell) and senior staff nurse Donna Jackson (Jaye Jacobs). Despite his overconfident persona, Griffiths did admire his work ethic. Xavier is "very ambitious and driven" but can lack empathy when patients need it most. He branded him a "marmite character who viewers are either going to love or hate." Xavier's behaviour developed because of his childhood. Griffiths said that writers planned to explore his past but they liked to portray Xavier being secretive about his personal and family life. As Xavier is a skilled surgeon, Griffiths needed to gain experience on acting out operations to make the character appear authentic. The show's production supplied him with a life-size model of a guest character for him to practise operating on. Griffiths stated that he "felt a sense of big responsibility" even though it was a fake operation. Xavier is portrayed in stylish attire when not wearing hospital scrubs. Griffiths liked his character's "great clothes" and labelled him a "bit of a flash". He quipped that Xavier was more like a "Milan catwalk model" than a doctor.
Family and relationships.
Xavier's reputation for not making friends is demonstrated early on in his tenure. When he meets F1 Nicky McKendrick (Belinda Owusu) in a bar, they get drunk together and she sleeps in the hospital on-call room. The following day Nicky cannot remember the events of the previous evening and asks Xavier for help. Griffiths explained that Xavier "enjoys winding people up" and refuses to help Nicky, teasing her about her behaviour. Griffiths believed that this episode "sets the tone of their relationship". Writers soon paired Xavier with Nicky's best friend, F1 Meena Chowdhury (Salma Hoque). Writers kept their relationship confined to Xavier's non-commitment rules. Griffiths told Tyler ("Inside Soap") that Xavier and Meena's relationship is a "friends with benefits" arrangement. Meena is naturally "a lot more invested" in their relationship because he is a "ladies' man and a charmer." Meena becomes jealous of Xavier's friendship with Nicky. He gives Nicky money to pay off her debts and they grow closer. When the pair are trapped in a room together, they confide in each other and Xavier tells Nicky about his brother's death. Xavier soon ends his relationship with Meena, who then accuses Nicky of having sex with her boyfriend.
Griffiths was worried that Xavier would be forever portrayed as "an entitled brat." He met with producers and requested further development of his family. Writers obliged and began to explore Xavier's backstory and family. Xavier details on-screen how he had a younger brother, Noah, who had died. It was revealed that Noah had been sent to his room for misbehaviour during Xavier's birthday party. With Xavier receiving the attention, Noah ran off and was fatally knocked down by a car. This lead Xavier to blame himself for his brother's death. Then Xavier's grandfather, Reg Thompson (Jeffery Kissoon) was admitted to AAU requiring surgery, accompanied by Xavier's brother Alex Duval (Leemore Marrett Jr.). Xavier accuses Alex of abusing their grandfather but soon realises he is mistaken. Alex refuses to accept his brother's apology and orders him to resolve his issues of Noah's death.
In later episodes, Xavier's mother Nanette Duval (Suzette Llewellyn) is introduced. Nanette suffers from bipolar disorder and arrives at the hospital in a confused state. Doctors manage to find that Nanette has been overdosing on lithium. Xavier fears he may lose his job after secretly supplying his mother with the lithium. He was given a reprieve when consultant Sacha Levy (Bob Barrett) decides not to report Xavier. Xavier's father Marlon Duval (Ricky Fearon) was soon introduced into the story. Griffiths believed it was "amazing" to explore the family element of Xavier's story. He also praised Lewellyn as an "amazing" addition to "Holby City". In another episode, Nanette arrives at the hospital in a confused state. Xavier is busy in an operating theatre helping consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie). Donna fears that she has harmed someone upon discovering a blood-stained train ticket in her belongings. Marlon is then brought into AAU suffering a stab wound and requires surgery. Donna is forced to remove Xavier from the operation and he fears his father may die. Griffiths was happy that all of Xavier's family featured in the show. He told Stephen Patterson from "Metro" that "it just filled the inner life of this person that I was stepping into, and that’s kind of the bread and butter, and once you get that."
An unlikely friendship was scripted between Xavier and hospital porter Jason Haynes (Jules Robertson). The duo bond over a patient's care. The story begins when they witness Sian Evans (Ajjaz Awad) thrown from a vehicle in the hospital car park. Xavier and Jason go to help and discover a stab wound to her torso. Jason stems the bleeding by applying pressure with his jumper. Xavier thanks Jason for helping to save Sian, but becomes annoyed with him when he becomes fixated on helping with the rest of the case. Xavier loses his patience and angrily informs Jason that he is just a porter. Xavier discovers that Sian has a baby; she remains unconscious and the hospital are unable to locate the child. Jason makes amends and tracks down the car and successfully locates Sian's baby. Griffiths observed a good team dynamic of doctor and porter working together and said writers had planned more stories together. He believed he and Robertson worked well together, calling the experience it "amazing" and a "privilege".
Soon after Xavier and Meena's break-up, producers created a new romance between Xavier and nurse Donna. Amy Johnson from the "Daily Express" reported that the two would become close following the advice of a patient. Donna soon realises that she has developed romantic feelings for Xavier. Writers soon developed their connection into a serious relationship. Griffiths approved of the relationship and believed that the relationship would "evolve" Xavier "in a completely different way." The actor branded Donna a "lighthouse" in Xavier's story who helps him resolve the issues of his past. He added that "she was the vessel that carried him through all that and really taught him how to love and be himself and not be guarded."
Nanette's arrival also causes problems for their romance. Nanette takes a disliking to Donna and disapproves of her treating an injury on AAU. Nanette warned Donna that she would return to the ward and get Xavier's attention. She is readmitted with a more severe injury, which causes an argument with Xavier. The camera angles used in the scenes panned to an "evil" facial expression aimed at Donna. After their break-up, Griffiths assessed that Xavier's relationship with Donna changed his character's selfish personality. He told Patterson that Donna "softened him, she made him realise who he really is, and removed all the ego and the arrogance and really got to the grit of who he is."
Feud with Cameron Dunn and death.
Producers created a feud between Xavier and CT1 Cameron Dunn (Nic Jackman). He suspects that Cameron is a liar and allowed Jason to illegally perform a medical procedure in a broken lift. Cameron took the credit for saving the patient and covered for Jason. Jackman explained that Cameron "makes the wrong decisions" and Xavier sets out to expose his lies. Jason soon confirms to Xavier that he performed the procedure. Cameron had previously let abusive surgeon Evan Crowhurst (Jack Ryder) die in intensive care. When an investigation is launched into Evan's death, Xavier notices that Cameron becomes nervous. He begins to suspect that Cameron was involved and vows to expose the truth. Cameron realises that Xavier is suspicious and begins plotting against him. He makes Xavier believe that he has poisoned his coffee. Xavier confronts Cameron and he makes comments about his mental health, insinuating that he is bi-polar like his mother. Cameron's mind games lead to a violent confrontation. Xavier is subsequently suspended for attacking Cameron in the work place.
After his suspension, Xavier remains fixated on ruining Cameron's career. He is called into work to face a disciplinary hearing but decides to concentrate on Cameron. Griffiths told Victoria Wilson from "What's on TV" that "Zav goes all out to bring Cameron down" and likened the plot to a "spy thriller" film. Griffiths added that his character actively pursues Cameron because "feels he's got nothing to lose", after losing his career and girlfriend. Xavier finds evidence off security footage that proves Cameron let Evan die. He confronts Cameron in the hospital basement and warns him that he will inform the police. Griffiths added that Cameron "reaches a whole new level of deception, through calculated plans and sheer luck, he manages to orchestrate Zav's downfall." On his way to the police station, Cameron chases after Xavier and he is hit by a cyclist. The impact knocks Xavier over and he hits his head on the curb. Xavier later dies from his injuries and Cameron gets away with his crimes. The story formed Griffiths' departure from "Holby City" and he confirmed that these were his final scenes as Xavier.
Xavier's departure from the show was not publicised in advance spoilers. Griffiths had to keep Xavier's departure a secret to shock viewers, which he found difficult. He told Sophie Dainty from Digital Spy that he was happy with his exit story because it was memorable. He added "I am all about arc; about where people start and where people finish [...] he ended up dying trying to do the right thing." Producers informed Griffiths that his character would be killed off in Cameron's story. Griffiths told Patterson ("Metro") that he understood why they wanted it to be Xavier. When the character was introduced he was "so self-involved" and only interested in climbing "the corporate ladder". Griffiths thought this was "Shakespearean tragedy" because Xavier died as he was finally doing something to help others, rather than himself. He likened Xavier to a "sacrificial lamb" because had he remained, Cameron's story would have concluded.
The actor believed Xavier's exit story highlighted the fragility of life. He was killed by a bicycle and a "simple knock to the head on the kerb"; Griffiths thought it was important to recognise "something very arbitrary" like Xavier's accident can kill. Following his death, Xavier's organs are donated to other patients. His colleagues also perform a heart transplant using Xavier's heart. His final scene depicted the character lay dead on a mortuary slab. Griffiths found the scene upsetting to film. He revealed that he did "tear up" because "it was an accumulation of a lot of hours and pressure at times." Xavier's death also formed a conclusion to the story with Donna. Jacobs was "sad" about Griffiths' departure and called his death a "big shock". She also felt sorry for her character having to grieve his death. Griffiths was unhappy with the ending Xavier and Donna received. He described it as a "big bugbear" that Xavier did not reconcile with her prior to death. In their last shared scene, Griffiths wanted to make their interaction more emotional. But the episode's director did not like the idea because Xavier was unaware of impending death and more concerned about exposing Cameron's lies.
Reception.
For his portrayal of Xavier, Griffiths was nominated for "Best Soap Newcomer" at the 2018 "Digital Spy" Reader Awards. He came in ninth place, receiving 3 per cent of the total votes. "Inside Soap's" Tyler branded Xavier a "hot new medic" and "handsome registrar" who made "Holby City" worth watching. Griffiths' colleague Hugh Quarshie believed Xavier was the "most fancied character" on the show. He also revealed that Griffiths had received nude fan mail. A "Radio Times" writer believed that Xavier had "slippery charm". Victoria Wilson ("What's on TV") called him a "smooth registrar". The "Metro's" Patterson opined that Xavier was "the subject of some pretty incredible character development over the years."
Readers of entertainment website Digital Spy were not impressed with the decision narrative-wise to kill off Xavier. More than 3600 readers took part in the poll with 91 per cent voting that it was the incorrect decision. Sophie Dainty from the website branded Xavier's departure "Holby City's" "biggest twist of the year" and a "shocking story". A reporter from Heart radio agreed it was the show's "biggest twist" and said viewers were "shocked". Charlie Milward from the "Daily Express" described his departure as some "heartbreaking scenes". Sasha Morris from the "Daily Star" branded the bikerider not reporting Cameron running from the crash scene a "plot hole". She added that fans were "horrified" and "devastated". Morris thought that Xavier's "turned upside down" by Nanette's arrival, adding that her story with Marlon "shocked" viewers. Sue Haasler from "Metro" stated that his death was a "huge shock".

Divertimenti for six winds (Mozart)

The divertimenti in F major (K 213), B-flat major (K 240), E-flat major (K 252/240a), F major (K 253), and B-flat major (K 270) are five companion compositions for pairs of oboes, horns and bassoons by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
Background.
The five wind sextets K 213, 240, 252/240a, 253, and 270 have historically been regarded as a series of five "Tafelmusik" (dinner music) works for the Salzburg court. In relation to this, the periodicity in the datings of January and July/August of the years 1775 to 1777, present on the autographs of four of them, is striking. If it is true that the pieces were written as "Tafelmusik" for the Archbishop of Salzburg, then there must have been specific and regularly recurring events every winter and summer accounting for this pattern; so far, though, none have been found. Even though in the "Anstellungsdekret für Joseph Fiala" [the decree of appointment for Joseph Fiala, currently in the "Landesarchiv Salzburg"], issued by the Archbishop on 1 November 1778, one reads "According to which we most graciously receive and welcome the supplicant into our service, subject to his good conduct, as first oboist, in order that the same, both in the Cathedral and at Court or elsewhere as we may require him, should participate diligently in the music and once again bring the wind instruments to that condition which they formerly had, so that they can perform at our command music with wind instruments at table [...]" no documents containing definite groups of musicians or concrete commissions for music have been found. The two summer datings of July and August could perhaps be linked to the semester holidays at the university at which time the students were responsible for the "Finalmusik" played at the summer residence of the Prince Archbishop, amongst others. For the two January dates, however, possible occasions of this kind have not been identified.
The sequences of keys within the group of five is also striking: F major/B–flat major/E-flat major for K 213, 240 and 252/240a, and F major/B-flat major for K 253 and 270. This two-fold occurrence of adjacent keys in the circle of fifths suitable for wind instruments may have been conceived with something of a pedagogical intention, most likely by Leopold Mozart. The apparent absence of an additional divertimento in E-flat major to complete a set of six (the usual number needed for publication) led early musicologists, including Alfred Einstein, to believe that the Divertimento in E-flat major K 289/271g was also part of the set, but the latter's authenticity is now in considerable doubt (see below). Within the five works the sequence of keys throughout the movements is quite regular. The slow movements (in K 252/240a this would be the Polonaise) are in either the dominant or subdominant key, while all the others are in the principal key. The "Trios" of the "Menuetti" are in the subdominant key, except for that of K 240 which is the related minor key.
The designation "divertimento" found on each of the autographs is in Leopold Mozart's hand. This and the fact that he numbered the pieces from I to V is a strong indication that he wanted to have the pieces printed. The five divertimenti were, however, never published during the Mozarts' lifetimes, perhaps due to the missing sixth piece. After Mozart’s death, Nissen changed the numbering fixed by Leopold and placed one of the divertimenti for ten winds, K 166/159d, in front of the sextets. Apparently, Johann Anton André was not misled by this and he published a very carefully prepared set of parts in the original order in 1801.
The Neue Mozart Ausgabe (NMA) quite rightly states that the five sextets have been underestimated in both the literature and musical practice: they are seldom performed in concert programs and the relevant literature usually mentions them only briefly without any detailed examination. This underestimation is most likely mainly due to the notion that, as mere "table music", the divertimenti are musically too superficial to deserve the attention the rest of Mozart's oeuvre does. Taking into account the restricted technical capabilities of the wind instruments featured here, these divertimenti can stand comparison with the Italian string quartets from the point of view of both compositional technique and richness of invention. The rich palette of tone colours associated with the oboes, horns and bassoons actually gives these works a particular sound not found in the works for strings. In addition, Mozart's five sextets are clearly superior to the analogous productions of his contemporaries.
These five divertimenti clearly comprise the second stage in Mozart's development as a composer of wind music, the first consisting of the two divertimenti for ten winds (K 186/159b and 166/159d), and the third of the large-scale serenades, K 361/370a, 375, and 388/384a, written in Vienna. The slightly gauche effects of K 186/159b and 166/159d, in which writing in thirds or sixths prevails, have been replaced in these five sextets by a greater mastery of the material which shows itself mainly in the considerably more developed independence of the six voices. Indeed, the first bassoon has been freed from its part as an additional bass instrument and has been transformed into a second solo voice.
Divertimento in F major, K 213.
The autograph is preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiellońska Kraków and is dated July 1775. The work consists of the following four movements:
This first sextet is the least sophisticated of the set. The "Allegro spiritoso" is in sonata form but the development section is quite brief. The subsequent "Andante" has a ternary structure and sees the first oboe paired with the first bassoon, and the second oboe briefly with the second bassoon. The "Trio" is a Ländler. The most important feature of the final "Contredanse en Rondeau" are the horns which are given the opportunity to shine as soloists on several occasions.
Divertimento in B-flat major, K 240.
The autograph is preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiellońska Kraków and is dated January 1776. The work consists of the following four movements:
The opening "Allegro" is more elaborate than the corresponding movement in K 213 with a fuller second subject and a recapitulation starting in the middle of the first subject; the formal repetition of the opening statement is reserved for the very end of the movement. The "Menuetto" is quite striking due to the droning second oboe during the opening statement and the dotted rhythms the different voices seem to be teasing each other with during the repeat of this statement. The "Allegro" finale is in sonata form and more rhythmic than melodic, save for the gentle C minor second subject first presented by the first oboe and then repeated, an octave lower, by the first bassoon. According to the explicit indication in the autograph the horns in K 240 are "corni alti in B" ["high" horns in B-flat].
Divertimento in E-flat major, K 252/240a.
The autograph is preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiellońska Kraków and is undated; Wolfgang Plath deduced a date "probably between January and August 1776" placing it somewhere between K 240 and 253, but its date of composition cannot be fixed more precisely than this, even with the help of calligraphic examination. The work consists of the following four movements:
The third divertimento in the series sets itself apart from the other four by opening with a lazy "Andante" in 6/8 time with an unusual number of dynamic marks. In the "Menuetto" the first horn is prominently brought to the foreground; the subsequent "Trio" is in the solemn key of A-flat major. Polonaises rarely occur in Mozart's music (an exception is a movement in the fifth divertimento of K 439b, for three basset horns); in K 252/240a the dance has an unusual swagger and a very brief "coda". The brilliant "Presto assai" is based on the Austria tune "Die Katze lasst das Mausen nicht".
Divertimento in F major, K 253.
The autograph is preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiellońska Kraków and is dated August 1776. The work consists of the following three movements:
The syncopated "Andante" theme of the initial movement could be a creation of Mozart himself and in the subsequent variations the composer entrusts solo tasks to all three pairs of instruments, including the horns. In the first, the first oboe present a broken-down version of the theme with limited contributions of second oboe and first bassoon. The second has the theme in the first oboe supported by a dialogue between second oboe and second bassoon in triplets. In the third, first oboe and first bassoon present the melody in octaves, while the fourth combines both oboes and both horns in the reworked theme with both bassoons in frantic 32nd-note figurations below. The fifth is the customary "Adagio" variation displaying a legato line and great clarity. The sixth constitutes the reprise of the "Andante" theme but played "Allegretto": at the end of the fifth variation the autograph mentions "variatio 6:ta il thema ma allegretto". The calm "Trio" contrasts the more noble and expressive "Menuetto". The ternary "Allegro assai" opens with a bold "unisono" statement and closes with a "coda".
Divertimento in B-flat major, K 270.
The autograph is preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiellońska Kraków and is dated January 1777. The work consists of the following four movements:
The fifth and final divertimento is the most sophisticated of the set. The "Allegro molto" is in full sonata form with a development section and a varied repeat in the recapitulation. The "Andantino" is a gavotte with a tiny but delightful three-beat canonic episode between first oboe and second bassoon at the beginning; the "coda" features four bars of Alberti-bass accompaniment for the first horn bringing the latter to prominence. The "Menuetto" carries the specific indication of "moderato" and features a peculiar hiccup in the second bar; the "Trio" is a Ländler. The "Presto" is an uncompromising 3/8 gigue featuring a brief moment of glory for the first bassoon in the "coda". Although the explicit indication is missing from the autograph the horns in K 270 are "corni alti in B" ["high" horns in B-flat].
Divertimento in E-flat major, K 289/271g.
K 289/271g comes down to us only via parts and score copies, all dating from the second half of the 19th century and attributed to Mozart, but no autograph is known. Based on its structure, however, it is highly unlikely that it was actually composed by Mozart: the decidedly obsolete writing seen from the many consecutive fifths and octaves, sometimes involving even the outer parts, the constant motion in parallel thirds and comparative lack of fantasy in the use of the horns, speaks against the authenticity of the piece. The NMA presents it as a work of dubious authenticity, and, most likely for this reason, it is generally not included in performances or recordings of the set of five.

Rick Stoner

Colonel Richard Stoner is a fictional secret agent appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character, created by Barry Dutter and M.C. Wyman, first appeared in "Fury" #1 (May 1994).
Rick Stoner was played by Patrick Warburton in the Marvel Cinematic Universe TV series "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."s fifth and seventh seasons.
Fictional character biography.
Rick Stoner was a hard man who always stuck to the rules and showed much disdain towards his fellow World War II soldiers, specifically Nick Fury whom he had a love-hate relationship of sorts with. He along with James "Logan" Howlett worked at the C.I.A. and fought Hydra. Stoner was eventually offered the director's seat of the then newly formed S.H.I.E.L.D. Upon looking at the Howling Commandos' dossiers, he told himself that "these jokers will never become S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as long as I'm director". His director status is short lived as he's shot and killed by Hydra while trying to uncover a traitor within S.H.I.E.L.D.
This turned out to be a cover up with Stoner actually having been disavowed and abandoned by S.H.I.E.L.D., plotting revenge against Fury for taking his job. Now under the Fallen Angel codename, he plots to use a project to manipulate reality. Stoner and Fury have a battle over the project, ending up trapped in a pocket universe. Fury ultimately prevails while Stoner is killed.
In other media.
Rick Stoner appears in "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.", portrayed by Patrick Warburton. This version is a military general from the 1970s. He first appears in the season five episode "All the Comforts of Home" as a prerecorded holographic greeting message for a then-uninhabited version of a S.H.I.E.L.D. base called the Lighthouse. In the episode "Option Two", Phil Coulson's team learn that Stoner had equipped the Lighthouse for every possible type of apocalyptic scenario after he unknowingly activates the nuclear option, causing the Lighthouse to go into lockdown. After a Gravitonium-powered Glenn Talbot defeats alien warriors sent to kill Coulson's team and takes Coulson to confront the aliens' leader Qovas, Stoner's holographic message appears again to announce the end of the nuclear protocol. Stoner makes his first physical appearance in the season seven episode "A Trout in the Milk", when the agents travel to the year 1973 in an alternate timeline created by the Chronicoms, and Daniel Sousa identifies him as "Little Ricky", a junior agent who "couldn't tell the difference between a clip and a mag." Due to the Chronicoms' influence in the 1950s, Stoner unknowingly approves of a Hydra plot identified as , which was developed decades early. Coulson and Melinda May confront Stoner and attempt to warn him of the plot, but the latter is forced to knock him out after using her empathetic abilities to determine he did not believe them. Stoner eventually does so after two Chronicoms attempt to steal his face and teams up with May to take out the remaining Chronicoms and kills their leader Luke, before parting with the future S.H.I.E.L.D. agents on good terms.

A-ba-ba-ha-la-ma-ha

Ivan Malkovych's Publishing House "A-ba-ba-ha-la-ma-ha" is a Ukrainian publishing house that was founded in 1992, becoming the first private children's book publisher in independent Ukraine. It started to publish books for a wider range of readers in 2008. Ivan Malkovych is a founder, as well as director and the main editor. He controls the publishing of each and every book from its manuscript to the final printing process.
History.
The publishing house name derives from a phrase "a-ba-ba-ha-la-ma-ha" firstly used in Ivan Franko's short story "Hrytseva shkilna nauka" (Hryts's Schooling), whose main character learns how to read by syllables using the phrase "a-ba-ba-ha-la-ma-ha" (stands for "A baba halamaha", which literally means "And a grandma is a blabber").
The publishing house for "children from 2 to 102" presented its first title "The Ukrainian Alphabet" in July 1992. As Ivan Malkovych stated: "At first I didn't think of the publishing house, all I had in mind was an alphabet book starting with the word "Angel". I didn't want it to be words like "Autobus" and "Akula" (Shark) or whatever on purpose. I wanted my book to start with the "Angel"."
A New York publishing house Alfred A. Knopf purchased a publication rights of the "A-ba-ba-ha-la-ma-ha's" children book "The Kitten and the Rooster" in 1995. It was the first time a notable Western publisher expressed its interest in a book of a Ukrainian publishing house.
Following the success in The Moscow International Book Fair in 2001, Malkovych decided to open a branch office in Russia, which was established in Moscow in 2004. The publishing house commenced publishing books in Russian, that were not to be distributed in Ukraine.
The new Ukrainian translation of "Hamlet" executed by Yuri Andrukhovych was published in 2008, for which the publishing house received a Grand Prix of Ukrainian contest "The Best Book of The Lviv Publishers' Forum".

Olympic dueling

Pistol duelling was a sport at the 1906 Intercalated Games and 1908 Olympics.
In the 1906 Intercalated Games, male competitors fired duelling pistols at plaster dummies from 20m and 30m.
In 1908 pistol duelling was demonstrated as part of the concurrent Franco-British Exhibition, using the Olympic fencing arena and in front of invited guests. There were no official demonstration sports until 1912. The competition involved two male competitors firing at each other with duelling pistols loaded with wax bullets and wearing protective equipment for the torso, face, and hands. Teams were sent by countries including France, the UK and the USA. The 20 meter competition was won by the French team of Major Ferrus, J Marais and J Rouvcanachi.

Hope in Shadows.
In 2003 Pivot Legal Society started Hope in the Shadows, a photo contest in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. Pivot Legal Society asked participants to photograph things that were important to them, with the intent that this would give the participants a voice and recognition for their efforts. The initial contest led to the creation of a yearly calendar project where each year's winners are asked to share their story along with their image. This calendar is released in October of every year, and contains the winning photos of the participants chosen by local artists in the city. The calendars are sold through "Megaphones" vendor program which hires 200 people from low-income backgrounds each season, each vendor keeps half of their sales. There have been 75,000 calendars sold since 2003.
In 2008 the book "Hope in Shadows" by Jerome and Brad Cran was released through Arsenal Pulp Press and the Pivot Legal Society that compiled 35 different stories attached to winning images from the photo contest. Their book took the stories associated with the winning photographs and expanded them with interviews of the photographers from the photo contest. They wrote about the traumas, abuse and mental illness but also friendship, laughter and love, which were reoccurring themes in the stories of the images. The stories capture the lives of First Nations people who survived residential schools, individuals coping with addictions, and others overcoming loss of loved ones. "Hope in Shadows" was published in 2009 and soon after this date the calendar sold 5000 more copies. "Hope in Shadows" won the City of Vancouver Book Award, was shortlisted for the Roderick Haig-Brown Regional Prize, and was longlisted for the George Ryga Award for Social Awareness in Literature.

Georg Decker

Georg Decker (7 December 1818 – 13 February 1894) was an Austro-Hungarian portrait artist.
Decker was born in Hungary to a German-speaking family, and grew up and made his career in Vienna, where he taught painting as well as working as a portrait and historical artist. Thanks to his teaching, he was sometimes referred to as "Herr Professor Georg Decker".
Appointed as a knight of the Order of Franz Joseph, Decker has been called "a renowned portraitist of Vienna's highest society".
Life.
Decker was one of the sons of the artist Johann Stephan Decker and the brother of the artists Albert (1817–1871) and Gabriel Decker (1821–1855). He was born in Pest, in the Kingdom of Hungary, but in 1821 the Decker family moved to the imperial city of Vienna, where he grew up and was taught to draw and paint in watercolour and miniature by his father. As early as 1835, a drawing by Georg Decker of the composer Wenzel Müller was lithographed by F. Wolf. He began to exhibit watercolours in 1837 and in the early 1840s was accepted as a student at the Academy of Fine Arts, where he learnt to paint in oils. After that, Decker painted portraits in oils, and then from the 1850s also in pastels, having studied the work of Mengs and Liotard in Dresden and been captivated by the medium. Great success in this field soon followed. By 1860, Decker was conducting a private art school and in 1861 became a member of the Vienna "Künstlerhaus".
Outside the world of art, Decker was an active member of the Vienna Chess Company ("Wiener Schachgesellschaft") while Albert Salomon Anselm von Rothschild was its driving force.
In 1851 Decker married Ottilie von Sobek, who died in 1860. In 1861 he married secondly Josefine Helene von Lucam (1829–1914).
On his son's name day on 17 April 1869, the Emperor Franz Joseph presented the ten-year old Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria, with a portrait of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen, victor of Aspern, by Decker. In 1872, the Emperor rewarded Decker's achievements in art by giving him the Knight's Cross of the Order of Franz Joseph.
When Decker died in 1894, the city of Vienna acquired a large number of sketches and portrait lithographs from his estate. He was buried in the Vienna Central Cemetery, and in 1909 a street in the Meidling district of Vienna was named "Deckergasse" in his honour, the mayor's year-book describing him as "the outstanding Viennese painter ("hervorragenden Wiener Maler") Georg Decker" and noting that "Deckergasse" was near "Canalettogasse". The "Deckergasse" crosses the Wilhelmsdorfer Park, which is also known as the Decker Park.

Manet Harrison Fowler

Manet Harrison Fowler (August 30, 1895 — February 1976) was an American musician, dramatic soprano, artist, voice coach, piano teacher, conductor, music educator and midwife. She was a child prodigy, giving piano recitals at the age of six. A native of Fort Worth, Texas she founded the Mwalimu School for the development of African Music and Creative Art in 1928 and relocated to New York City during the Harlem Renaissance. She was President of the Texas Association of Negro Musicians (TANM), the first state branch of the National Association of Negro Musicians.
Early life.
Minnia (later respelled "Manet") Helen Harrison was born in Fort Worth, Texas, to Louisiana natives Taylor Henry Harrison, an African American and Carrie Vickers Harrison, a creole of African, French and Irish descent. She showed talent for music from an early age, playing piano at church from age six. Manet attended the Tuskegee Institute, and graduated in 1913. She pursued further studies in visual arts at The Art Institute of Chicago and in music at the Chicago Musical College and American Conservatory of Music. A well known painter of her time, she was also an opera singer performing around the country as a dramatic soprano.
Career.
Fowler taught music at Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College, and directed a church choir in Fort Worth. She was co-founder of the Texas Association of Negro Musicians in 1926, and she served on the board of the National Association of Negro Musicians, as scholarship committee chair, and edited its journal, "The Negro Musician".
In 1928, she started the Mwalimu School. She moved the Mwalimu program to Harlem in 1932, where (as the Mwalimu Center for African Culture) it became a contribution to the Harlem Renaissance. Literary figures such as Carter G. Woodson taught at Mwalimu in Harlem. The school also offered a community kitchen, a library of works by black authors, and lessons from bodybuilding to comparative religion. The school's Mwalimu Festival Chorus performed often in New York, and made recordings, under Fowler's direction; they were called "one of the outstanding Negro choral groups in technical proficiency" by Alain LeRoy Locke.
In 1930, a pageant Fowler wrote, produced, and directed, "The Voice", was performed by over 2000 cast members at the National Baptist Convention in Chicago. She also wrote "Up From Slavery", and another musical piece, "African Suite". Several paintings by Manet Harrison Fowler are in the Juneteenth Museum in Fort Worth. A portrait she painted of her daughter Manet Helen Fowler is in the permanent collection at Yale University Art Gallery.
In 1972, Fowler was honored alongside Duke Ellington, Ramsey Lewis, Everett Lee, and Margaret Rosezarian Harris at the annual awards dinner at the Waldorf Astoria, New York for the National Association of Negro Musicians.
Personal life.
Manet Harrison married fellow educator Stephen Hamilton Fowler in 1915. They had five children, including Manet Helen Fowler, the first African American woman to earn a Ph.D in cultural anthropology in the U.S. and George H. Fowler, former Commissioner of the NYS Division of Human Rights and the first African American named to a cabinet rank by Governor Nelson Rockefeller. Manet Harrison Fowler was widowed in 1965, and died in 1976, aged 80 years, in New York. The Manet Harrison Fowler and Manet Helen Fowler Papers are archived together at the Beinecke Library at Yale University. Another collection of her papers is at Emory University.

There was an outburst of meteor activity from 19 June 2019 until 26 June 2019 when 88 June epsilon Ophiuchids were detected by the Cameras for Allsky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) network. The June epsilon Ophiuchids created 50% of the fireball detections in the period 22–24 June. This outburst offers evidence of past activity of 300P/Catalina. The radiant is near 16:21 (245.2) -7.4 in the constellation of Ophiuchus. The June epsilon Ophiuchids radiate from a very large scattered radiant area and may be related to a number of other minor showers that have been identified. The meteors have a velocity of around 14 km/s.

GL5 Active Protection System

The GL5 Active Protection System is an active protection system developed in China by NORINCO designed for main battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. The system can detect incoming warheads such as anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) with a range of 100m and within a 360-degree horizontal and 20-degree band. Upon detection, two defensive rockets are fired at the incoming threat. The system employs four multi-mission fire control radars for tracking and engaging incoming threats. It is to be installed on VT-4 main battle tanks.
