Pyramid of Senusret II

The Pyramid of Senusret II, (in ancient Egyptian Kha Senusret meaning Senusret Shines), is the pyramid complex constructed for the pharaoh Senusret II in the Twelfth Dynasty.
Location and early excavation.
Karl Richard Lepsius visited the pyramid in the 1840s and conducted a brief archaeological survey of the site. Fifty years later, Flinders Petrie conducted the first comprehensive excavations there. Petrie spent several unsuccessful months searching for the entrance into the pyramid on the north face of the pyramid. Senusret II had, however, taken a complete departure from the usual practice of having a corridor on the north side typical of Old Kingdom and early Middle Kingdom pyramids and had instead built a narrow, vertical entrance shaft under a princess' tomb located about a dozen yards off to east of the southern pyramid face. The Czech Egyptologist Miroslav Verner explains that the decision had been made for a combination of religious reasons, and to thwart grave robbers. The builders had even constructed the usual small chapel on the north face, which typically concealed the entrance. Petrie did eventually find the entrance, after many months and multiple failed attempts.
A small team headed by N. B. Millet of the Royal Ontario Museum and the architect J. E. Knudstad has been working at the site of the pyramid town and pyramid since 1989. Their goal is to expand on Petrie's work by re-gathering architectural details of the monuments there, which Petrie had neglected to record in his reports.
On 28 June 2019, the pyramid was opened to visitors for the first time since its discovery.
Mortuary complex.
Main pyramid.
The core of the pyramid was constructed from mudbrick around a stump of four steps of yellow limestone. The builders utilized a rock outcropping to anchor the pyramid and reduce construction time and cost. The completed pyramid was originally encased in white limestone, though an inscription found by Petrie indicates that the casing was removed in the Nineteenth Dynasty for reuse in a different structure built by Ramesses II. Only remnants of the black granite pyramidion, which topped the pyramid, have been found. The pyramid was protected from flooding by a trench surrounding the perimeter of the pyramid and filled with sand to absorb rainwater. Around this trench, a stone perimeter wall was built and decorated with deep niches.
Substructure.
Typically, the substructure entry was located on the north face of the pyramid. This had been the traditional entry point since Djoser built his step pyramid in the Third Dynasty. Although Senusret II's pyramid was built with a north chapel included, its real entry was hidden-away under the floor of a princess' tomb to the south-east. This was used for the burial rites of the king, but was too narrow for use during construction. Instead, a larger deep construction shaft found further south was used for transporting the sarcophagus and building material into the substructure. This was then reworked into a fake burial chamber in an attempt to deceive thieves attempting to enter the king's tomb.
The base of the construction shaft opens up into a vaulted horizontal corridor. The corridor runs north to a vaulted room, containing the real entry shaft and a second unexplored shaft that has been flooded by ground water. The corridor then continues north with a slight incline leading to the antechamber. Part way along, a second chamber is found in its west. The antechamber contained two passageways: one leads from the antechamber to the burial chamber directly west; the other, located in the south, leads around the chamber eventually entering it from the north. The winding passage may have served a symbolic purpose, allowing the king's spirit to the leave the chamber towards the north. The burial chamber and labyrinth of passageways were shifted south-east of the vertical axis of the pyramid, another deviation from the standard.
The burial chamber is oriented on the east–west axis, has a vaulted ceiling made from granite blocks, and a red granite sarcophagus near its west wall. Despite the precautions taken, the burial chamber was found looted of most of its contents by Petrie. An alabaster offering table inscribed with Senusret II's name, a gold uraeus, and leg bones, believed to belong to the king, are all that remained of the burial.

Ellangowan (horse)

Ellangowan (1920 – 1943) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He raced only once as a two-year-old but showed considerable promise when finishing third in a top-class event at Kempton. In the following spring he came in third in the Craven Stakes before recording his biggest win in the 2000 Guineas. Although be made no impact in the Epsom Derby or the St Leger, he had further major victories in the St James's Palace Stakes Champion Stakes. He failed to win in 1924 and was retired to stud, but had little success as a breeding stallion.
Background.
Ellangowan was a bay horse bred and owned by Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery. During his racing career he was trained by Jack Jarvis at the Park Lodge at Newmarket, Suffolk. The colt was named after a location in Walter Scott's novel "Guy Mannering".
He was one of the best horses sired by Lemberg, whose wins included the Epsom Derby, Eclipse Stakes and Champion Stakes. Lemberg also sired the Epsom Oaks winner Pogrom and was Champion sire in 1922. Ellangowan's dam Lammermuir also produced Lady Nairne, the dam of Colombo: she was a daughter of Montem, a broodmare whose other descendants included Sweet Solera, Aunt Edith and Blind Luck.
Racing career.
1922: two-year-old season.
On his only start as a juvenile in 1922 Ellangowan finished third behind Twelve Pointer and Brownhylda in the International Two-year-old Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse.
1923: three-year-old season.
Ellangowan began his second season by running third behind Light Hand and Twelve Pointer in the Craven Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in April. On 2 May 1923 Ellangowan, ridden by Charlie Elliott, started at odds of 7/1 in an eighteen-runner field for the 115th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile. Twelve Pointer started favourite, while the other fancied runners included Papyrus and Pharos. In a closely contested finish Ellangowan prevailed by a head from Knockando, with the 50/1 outsider D'Orsay half a length away in third place and Papyrus fourth. The colt's victory was reportedly greeted with "a great outburst of enthusiasm" by the crowd, possibly prompted by the popularity of his owner, who had been in very poor health. An unusual feature of the result was that the racecourse judge initially announced that Legality (carrying very similar colours to Knockando) had finished second and the mistake was not corrected until many bookmakers had paid out.
Ellangowan was well-fancied for the Epsom Derby but after tracking the leaders he dropped out of contention in the straight and finished eighth behind Papyrus. At Royal Ascot in June the colt was dropped back in distance for the St James's Palace Stakes and, with Elliott again in the saddle, won at odds of 3/1 from the favourite Chosroes. Ellangowan was entered in the St Leger at Doncaster Racecourse on 12 September but was not among the placed horses in a race won by the filly Tranquil In the Kingsclere Plate at Newbury seventeen days later the colt was beaten a length by Twelve Pointer, to whom he was conceding five pounds in weight. In October Ellangowan attempted to record his third major success of the year in the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket in which he started at odds of 11/4 in a four-runner field. After looking beaten in the last quarter mile he rallied strongly in the final furlong to win by a neck from Legality with Twelve Pointer a neck away in third.
Ellangowan ended the season with winnings of £14,885, making him the second most financially successful horse of 1923 in England.
1924: four-year-old season.
Ellangowan remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to win on his only start.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Ellangowan an "inferior" winner of the 2000 Guineas.
Stud record.
At the end of his racing career Ellangowan was acquired by the partnership of Jack Javis, John Fox and Rowland Rank and was retired to become a breeding stallion. His most successful offspring included Tartan, who won the Britannia Stakes in 1933. Ellangowan was euthanised in September 1943.

Karrie Keyes

Karrie Keyes is an American audio engineer and the executive director of SoundGirls, a non-profit organization that supports women in the sound industry. She has been the monitor engineer for Pearl Jam and Eddie Vedder for over 25 years and has toured with Soundgarden, Fugazi, Sonic Youth, Neil Young, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Keyes was one of very few women working as a live sound engineer in the 1980s and is recognized for her contributions to helping women in the sound industry (which is estimated to be 95% men). She was a 2017 honoree of the She Rocks Awards.
Youth.
Keyes was born and raised in Los Angeles. She would "fall in love" with songs she heard on the radio. She took music lessons from third grade to middle school (playing flute and clarinet) and gravitated towards the arts and music in high school. She was a fan of music who attended concerts and shows. In high school, she wasn't presented with career options in the music industry. She aspired to be a writer and to travel the world.
Keyes was a fan of punk music as a teenager. At 17, she was taking some classes at a community college and worked a part-time job in retail.
Early Industry Years.
Her first opportunity in sound came when she met sound engineer Dave Rat in 1986 at a Black Flag show on the In My Head tour. She was 17 at the time. Keyes worked her way to the front before the show and talked to Rat. He invited Keyes to the stage after the show and taught her how to wrap mic cables. The next day, she was in Palo Alto with Black Flag and knew she wanted to do sound.
Dave Rat owned a sound company, Rat Sound, and brought Keyes to work for him. Her first job was loading and unloading PA equipment from trucks at shows. She learned how to setup sound systems, do wiring and set change, how the gear worked, and troubleshooting. Rat Sound did a lot of punk rock shows in Southern California and the two did most shows themselves (with the occasional third person). Keyes was able to quit her part-time job and not go back to school.
She was taking any job offered from punk music to gospel to mariachi.
Keyes and Rat lived in a warehouse without hot water for two years so they could put money back into the business (for expenses like equipment, insurance and gas). She worked for Rat Sound from 1986-2005. In addition to sound work, she helped with accounting and bills and in her final five years, HR and management.
Monitor Engineer.
In her career, Keyes has primarily worked as a monitor engineer.
Her first tour was with The Untouchables working as a system tech for their Southern California gigs. When their front of house engineer left, she moved into mixing monitors for them until 1990. Keyes was monitor engineer for The Red Hot Chili Peppers who she toured with from 1990-2000. She met Pearl Jam in 1991 when they were opening for RHCP on the Blood Sugar Sex Magic Tour.
In 1995, Keyes toured with Neil Young on the Mirror Ball Tour. She was hired to tour with Fugazi because she did their location shows regularly and knew what they needed.
Keyes says monitor mixing is "not for the weak of heart." She says it's considered one of the most difficult jobs on tour.
Pearl Jam.
Pearl Jam hired Keyes in 1992 to finish their tour, which she did between RHCP tours. Keyes said the crew is like family because of how long they have been together.
As of 2016, the band uses a mix of in-ear monitors and wedges (Rat S Wedges for Eddie Vedder and EAW Microwedges for the rest of the band). The lead guitar player (Mike McCready) relies mainly on in-ear monitors. Keyes uses a DiGiCo SD5 console for their shows.
Some Pearl Jam fans recognize her as the "microphone girl" because she is on stage checking mics before the show begins.
SoundGirls.
Keyes co-founded SoundGirls in 2013 with Michelle Sabolchick Pettinato with the mission of "empowering the next generation of women in audio." SoundGirls is looking to increase the number of women in the workforce, which is currently at 5 percent.
Keyes and Sabolchick met when they were on a panel together at the 2012 AES Convention in San Francisco. The panel was hosted by the Women's Audio Mission called "Women of Professional Concert Sound" and was moderated by Terri Winston, the founder of WAM. The five panelists had never met before but found a lot of similarities in their experiences, work ethics and interests. They also recognized they had hadn't crossed paths or been able to support each other but they bonded "like sisters." Keyes and Pettinato decided to do something after. The original idea of Soundgirls was to create a website where women in audio could meet and network.
Since then, SoundGirls has grown to over 4,000 members and chapters worldwide. The organization assists with mentorships, job placement, workshops, and scholarships. The organization is inclusive of all genders and non-conforming genders. Keyes is currently the executive director and runs the organization on a daily basis.
In 2015, SoundGirls started holding recording camps in the summer for girls. These events are held in California, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis.
In 2018, SoundGirls teamed up with Spotify to create the EQL Directory, an international database for women working in audio and music production.
Keyes says of women in the industry, "Women must work harder, smarter, and be tougher, and by being those things is how you overcome adversity. Since starting SoundGirls I have learned that the issues women face are not limited to women; it affects all marginalized people. The industry needs diversity."
Personal life.
Keyes and Dave Rat had twin daughters in 1997 and Keyes toured while pregnant. They continued to work together professionally for many years.
The two tried to balance their tour schedules as much as possible and Keyes likened it to a military family where a parent may be gone for months at a time. She says of being a working mom, ""It took me probably till they were three or four to actually come to terms with, 'You know what, I'm actually a better mother if I'm doing what I love doing.' So that when I'm here, I'm completely here."
Keyes has been based in California for most of her career but lived in Seattle briefly during the Grunge era. One of her daughters has worked on the Warped Tour.
Awards.
Keyes was an honoree at the 2017 She Rocks Awards at the NAMM Show in Anaheim, CA. The She Rocks awards honors women who stand out within the music industry.
In 2019, Keyes won the audio innovator award for her work with soundgirls at the Parnelli Awards.

Happiness (short story)

"Happiness" () is an 1887 short story by Anton Chekhov. 
Publication.
The story was first published on 6 June 1887 by "Novoye Vremya" (issue No. 4046), in the Saturday Special (Субботники) section. With the added dedication to Yakov Polonsky, it featured in the 1888 "Rasskazy" (Рассказы, Stories) collection. 
Chekhov included it into volume four of his Collected Works published by Adolf Marks in 1900. During its author's lifetime, the story was translated into German, Serbo-Croatian, Slovak and Czech languages.
Background.
Chekhov wrote "Happiness" soon after making a visit to Taganrog, in May 1887, in the village of Babkino (then the estate of count Alexey S. Kiselyov) where he spent three summers, in 1885-1887. The setting of the narrative is apparently the Northern Taganrog region, for the Saur Grave (Саур-Могила) is here mentioned, the burial site, around which numerous legends had evolved, one of which Vladimir Korolenko retold in one of his sketches. Scary stories related to the children in their early years by their nurse Agafya Kumskaya might also have had some bearing upon this story, according to Mikhail Chekhov.
On more than one occasion Chekhov referred to "Happiness" as his best loved story and, while working on the collection "Rasskazy" insisted that it should open it. In January 1887 Yakov Polonsky published a poem called "U dveri" (At the Door) with a dedication to Chekhov. In the 25 March 1888 letter Chekhov wrote to Polonsky: "I am going to release my new collection of stories. It will feature the one called "Happiness" which I consider my best ever. I'd like to ask for your permission to dedicate it to you... It is about the steppe, the plane, the night, pale sunrise, flock of sheep and three silhouettes, talking about happiness."
Plot summary.
Two shepherds, a decrepit, toothless man of eighty, and his young counterpart, guarding a huge flock of sheep, have to spend the night by the broad steppe road. A man with a horse stops to ask for a light for his pipe. The old man recognizes him as Panteley, a land supervisor at the nearby Kovyli village, then informs him of the death of "a wicked old man" called Zhmenya, in whose presence melons whistled and pikes laughed. The latter's major fault though, from the speaker's point of view, was that he’d known where all the local treasures were hidden but would not tell anyone. After that the conversation evolves around this issue: it appears that gold and silver are in abundance here in the kurgans, but nobody can find them, because all of them are under the spell.
The old man warms up to the subject, which he seems to be obsessed with. It appears that he'd made numerous attempts at diggings, craving to find his 'happiness', but to no avail: all the treasures in the vicinity must have been put under spell. "But what will you do with the treasure when you find it?" the young man enquires. "I know what I'll do. I'll… I’ll show them!.." the old man promises but does not go beyond that. The conversation lasts until daybreak. Finally the supervisor leaves, apparently deeply moved by the information he had received. Even more meaningfully thoughtful look the sheep all around.
Critical reception.
On 14 June 1887 Alexander Chekhov wrote to his brother: "Well, my friend, you've made quite a stir with your last 'steppe' subbotnik. This piece is wonderful. Everybody talks about it. The praises are of the most ferocious nature... Burenin is composing a panegyric for you for the second week and still cannot finish it, finding difficulties with expressing himself clear enough... What everybody likes about this story is that, while lacking an actual theme it still succeeds in making such an impression. The sun rays, sliding across the land as the sun rises, cause storms of rapture, and the sleeping sheep are depicted in such a lively, magical and picturesque way that I am sure you’ve become a ram yourself while portraying all this sheepishness." "The steppe subbotnik is dear to my heart exactly for its theme, which you, the flock, failed to notice in it," Chekhov retorted in his 21 June letter.
The story was praised by Isaak Levitan, whose friendship with Chekhov started in Babkino, in summer 1885. "...You struck me as landscape-artist... In Happiness the pictures of the steppe, the kurgans, the sheep are extraordinary. Yesterday I showed this story to S.P. and Lika, and both were delighted," he wrote in June.
The original press reviews were mixed. Konstantin Arsenyev found the story "too stark and lacking both content and those wondrous details that often greatly empower the Chekhov sketches," he wrote in "Vestnik Evropy". Reviewing the collection "Rasskazy", "Novoye Vremya" rated "Happiness" as one of the best Chekhov stories ever, praising the author's taste for nuances and his deep knowledge of the country folk's ways. "Chekhov's characters always speak the language of the region they live in, and there is nothing artificial or contrived in their mindsets," the anonymous reviewer noted. Once the term 'impressionism' became in vogue in the Russian press, the story became almost synonymous with the new trend in literature. 
The in-depth analysis of the story was provided by the critic I.V. Ivanov (who used the penname I. Johnson). In his 1904 essay called "Seeking for Truth and the Meaning of Life", published by "Obrazovaniye", he argued that for Chekhov, after the "early period of superficial mirth for mirth's sake" there followed "the new phase of objective artistic contemplation of life…almost scientific in its approach." As a result, he started to produce stories the leitmotif for which was the idea that human life as such lacks any kind of moral law, reason or meaning. The pinnacle of this series, according to Johnson, was "Happiness", according to which "...life ha[d] neither reason, no meaning and man is reduced almost to naught. But not all life is such. One has to climb up one of those hills... to realize: there is out there a different life, which has nothing to do with subterranean happiness and sheepish ways of thinking."

2013 Balochistan provincial election

Provincial elections were held in the Pakistani province of Balochistan on 11 May 2013, alongside nationwide general elections and three other provincial elections in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab. The remaining two territories of Pakistan, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, were ineligible to vote due to their disputed status.
Background.
The 2013 elections resulted in a hung parliament, before Pakistan Muslim League (N), National Party, and Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party joined hands to form a coalition government. A power-sharing agreement was also brokered between PML-N and NP where the province's Chief Ministership tenure would be bifurcated between the two parties. In consequence, NP's Abdul Malik Baloch served as chief minister from 2013 to 2015 before he was replaced by PML-N's Sanaullah Khan Zehri at the end of 2015.
However, Zehri couldn't complete his term as on 2 January 2018, a number of dissident members from the ruling PML-N colluded with opposition lawmakers to submit a no-confidence motion against him. Seeing that he has lost the majority of the house's support in the ensuing turmoil, Zehri resigned from his post before a no-confidence vote could take place. Pakistan Muslim League (Q)'s, Abdul Quddus Bizenjo, an opposition lawmaker and one of the leaders of the no-confidence bloc, was elected as the province's 15th Chief Minister. He secured 41 of the 65 votes.

Phyllis Draper

Phyllis Draper, born on August 22, 1907, was a paleoecologist most notable for developing the first pollen diagram in North America in 1928. She began her career as a graduate student under Paul Sears, the chair of the botany department at the University of Oklahoma. Sears gave his students the freedom to explore unique topics in order to design their own theses. Draper took advantage of this, and during her time working and studying under Sears, she published two major papers entitled, "A Demonstration of the Technique of Pollen Analysis" and "A Comparison of Pollen Spectra of Old and Young Bogs in the Erie Basin." She believed that the fossil pollen could be used to make inferences about the climates of specific regions. Her first pollen graph showed the pollen in New Haven Bog, which included pteridophyte spores, grasses, pines, oak, and larch, and unknown pollen. She later updated this pollen diagram and developed another one for the Curtis Bog. Draper graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1929 with an M.S. in botany. She died on August 8, 2000.
First North American pollen diagram.
In 1928, Phyllis Draper was the first in North America to develop what would become one of the most common practices used in palynology - the pollen diagram. While attending the University of Oklahoma as a MS student, her first experience with this technique was during her study of New Haven Pond in New Haven, Ohio. Her study described the collection of the bog's subsurface peat that she called "borings." She used data from peat that had been separated and analyzed the pollen grains that had been boiled pollen in slightly basic conditions using potassium hydroxide. These were the data that she used to count the recurrence of different types of pollen. Her first ever pollen graph included pteridophyte spores, unknown spores, grasses, pines, oak, and larch. The patterns of the pollen graph represented the percentages of each listed species at various depths. The graph, however, did not have the axes labels that are standard today (depth on the y-axis and percent abundance on the x-axis). She admitted that her work could not lead to any conclusions due to the incompleteness of her results.
Second publication.
Phyllis Draper went on to expand the results from her first study and compare them to another bog, known as Curtis bog in Lucas country, Ohio. The goal of this study was to understand the origins of both locations based on the pollen collected in the peat samples. The methods of this study were more descriptive, but had many parallels with her previous paper, including the separation of the peat and the boiling of the pollen samples in potassium hydroxide. The samples were collected by Paul Sears. With more extensive data, Phyllis Draper was able to expand her previous pollen diagram of New Haven Bog. The methods section of the paper explained that depth went as deep as 10 feet subsurface. The y-axis depicts this depth with 1 at the top and 10 at the bottom, indicating that top to bottom was read as the "newest to oldest" sedimentation. This is the typical layout for pollen diagrams today. Across the x-axis was the percentage of each pollen type. Draper now had data for more species and was able to find a forest succession pattern present in the New Haven Bog via the observed disappearance and reappearance of trees with a dominance of conifer species. This was compared to Curtis Bog, which lacked the succession pattern. The overall goal of this paper was to compare the basal ages of the two bogs. This was not achieved because of unsuccessful dating techniques.
Later life.
After Draper graduated from the University of Oklahoma with an M.S. in botany, she was featured in an alumni news magazine and was recognized for becoming a teacher. She became a botany instructor at the University of Tennessee where she studied atmospheric pollen and advised students.

Career.
Bolton began her museum career in the Anthropology division of the Australian Museum firstly for the pilot survey of the Australian Pacific collections in 1979. From 1985 where she was the collection manager, and then senior collection manager, for the Pacific collection. During this time Bolton took leave to complete her PhD in social anthropology from the University of Manchester which she completed in 1994. Bolton left the Australian Museum in 1996 to work as an Australian Research Council Post-doctoral Fellow at the Centre for Cross Cultural Research at the Australian National University. From 1999 Bolton was a curator in the Department of Ethnography (later Department of Africa, Oceania and the Americas) at the British Museum and from January 2012 became Keeper (head of department) of Africa, Oceania and the Americas.
Bolton works in Vanuatu annually with the Vanuatu Cultural Centre (Vanuatu Kaljoral Senta) developing programmes to document and preserve women’s knowledge and practice. Bolton chairs the Women’s Culture Project, developing ni-Vanuatu women fieldworkers who document and preserve traditional knowledge and culture.
Bolton has worked on a series of major research projects focusing on Pacific anthropology. Most recently she has worked on "Melanesian art: objects, narratives and indigenous owners" (2005-2010) with Nicholas Thomas (University of Cambridge) and "Engaging Objects: Indigenous Communities, museum collections and the representation of indigenous histories" (2011-2014) with the Australian National University and the National Museum of Australia.
Among Bolton's curatorial work for the British Museum she was the lead curator in 2003 for the permanent gallery "Living and Dying" (The Wellcome Trust Gallery), and curated a number of temporary exhibitions including "Power and Taboo: Sacred Objects from the Pacific" (2006), "Dazzling the Enemy: shields from the Pacific" (2009), and "Baskets and Belonging: Indigenous Australian Histories" (2011).
Honours.
Bolton was the lead curator on the "Living and Dying" Gallery (Wellcome Trust Gallery) at the British Museum which won the Museums and Heritage Award for best Permanent Exhibition 2004.
Bolton delivered the Keynote Address to the Australian Anthropological Society Conference 2012 at the University of Queensland on "Materialised moments: objects, museum and Melanesia".
Bolton was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for "significant service to the museums sector, and to anthropology" in the 2021 Queen's Birthday Honours.

Margaret Murray Cookesley

Margaret Murray Cookesley or Murray-Cookesley (1844-1927), born Margaret Deborah Cookesley, took the name Murray upon marriage, and was an English painter. She traveled to the Middle East and painted oriental scenes in oils and water colours. She exhibited at the Royal Academy and the Society of Women Artists.
Life and career.
As reported by Clara Erskine Clement, Cookesley visited Constantinople where the sultan commissioned a portrait of his son; he was so pleased with this that he asked her to paint his wives as well, but she did not have time for this commission. She was awarded the Order of the Chefakat and the Medaille des Beaux-Arts in the Ottoman Empire.
Her "Circe resplendens" (1913) is in the collection of Glasgow Museums.
Work.
Some of her paintings are held in collections, including the Victoria Art Gallery, Bath ("Frederick Harrison, Author"); Towneley Hall, Burnley ("The Gambler's Wife"); the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool ("Cleopatra"); and the Graves Art Gallery, Sheffield ("The Egg Seller"); and Cartwright Hall, Bradford ("Rich and rare were the gems she wore"). However, Cookesley’s work is poorly represented in art museums. Yet, her paintings regularly appear in the catalogues of leading auction houses such as Sotheby’s and Christie’s. Scholar, Julia Kuehn, has explained this by pointing out that Cookesley’s work was intended for a mass market rather than as a form of high art. Thus, her paintings entered private collections where they continue to be traded among collectors. She painted numerous harem scenes

Château de La Ferté-Imbault

The Château de La Ferté-Imbault (Loir-et-Cher) is a stately home in the Loire Valley, France. A fortress in the Middle Ages and rebuilt in the Renaissance, it is the largest brick château in Sologne, and one of the oldest. It was the family seat of the House of d'Estampes for four centuries.
The "seigneurie" (lordship) of La Ferte-Imbault was the most important of the south of Sologne, and whose jurisdiction included the parishes of Salbris, Saint-Genou (now Selles-Saint-Denis), Marcilly, Loreux and Souesmes. It comprised more than one hundred farms spread over thousands of hectares, stretching from Loreux to Souesmes and from Saint-Viâtre to the limits of Theillay.
The château is a "rectangular building, with large windows and flanked by four towers of massifs and alleys of trees, an air of grandeur and poetry that strikes, everything at the same time, the heart and the imagination".(François Coillard) Its position "is quite pleasant and joyful, in a place where the Sauldre is divided into several channels ... The red turrets of the château expand amid these waters and this greenery, and crown wonderfully the rich picture".()
History.
A Roman occupation was found on the site of the present château.
A first fortress was built around 980 by Humbold (or Humbault) Le Tortu, and son-in-law of Thibault, comte de Blois. The proximity of the Sauldre feeds the moat. The bases of the two main towers remain to this day as the old weapons room. Hervé 1st, Seigneur de Vierzon and descendant of Humbold, had built on his return from the crusade, a collegiate in honor of Saint-Taurin. This ecclesiastical presence and the need to supply the fortress favor the emergence of the village of La Ferté-Imbault which is built around. In 1280 Jeanne de Vierzon, heiress of the lands of La Ferté-Imbault, weds Geoffroy de Brabant, comte d'Aerschot, son of duc Henry III de Brabant and Adelaide de Bourgogne (Burgundy). Geoffroy de Brabant was the brother-in-law of the King of France, Philip III the Bold. His daughter, Alix de Brabant, married in 1302. His marriage to Alix de Brabant, a rich heiress who brought him the seigneurie of La Ferté-Imbault, made him a close relative of the Duke of Brabant and the Kings of France, because Alix is also the niece of the Queen of France, Marie de Brabant.
The son of Jean III d'Harcourt and Alix de Brabant, Jean IV, first comte d'Harcourt, marries Isabeau de Parthenay. Their sons Guillaume d'Harcourt is the seigneur of La Ferté-Imbault. From his marriage to Blanche de Bray, Dame de Cernon, they had one daughter, Jeanne d'Harcourt, Dame de La Ferte-Imbault, who married Hugues de Montmorency. Their sons, Louis and Antoine, died at the Battle of Azincourt in 1415 for the first, and Verneuil in 1424 for the second. Their sister, Catherine de Montmorency, inherits the vast estate of La Ferté-Imbault after the death of her two brothers.
During the Hundred Years War, the castle was taken and destroyed by the troops of Edward the Black Prince, as well as the village. After having belonged without interruption during several centuries to the dynasty of Humbold Le Tortu, Seigneur of Vierzon, by the alliance of the families of Brabant, Harcourt and Montmorency, the estate is sold by Catherine de Montmorency to Robert II d'Estampes, Seigneur de Valençay, in 1424.
Joan of Arc stayed at La Ferté-Imbault on March 4, 1429.
The castle was rebuilt during the Renaissance. The royal power was nearby, in Blois, and Francis I of France came from Romorantin neighboring the land of La Ferté-Imbault.
Partially destroyed by a fire during the Wars of Religion in 1562, the castle was rebuilt and enlarged by the addition of two wings and large commons in the early seventeenth century by , marquis de Mauny, who was the richest landlord of the region, and the grandson of , the duc de Grancey of France, better known under the name of (Stendhal used this name for one of the characters of "Le rouge et le noir" ("The Red and the Black"), the maréchale de Fervaques). Jacques d'Estampes, head of the House of d'Estampes, was also be the first marquis of La Ferté-Imbault. His eldest son was Seigneur de Salbris. Born in the reign of Henry IV, the marquis de La Ferté-Imbault died in the reign of Louis XIV, after fighting alongside Louis XIII (whose bust still adorns the former guardhouse of the château). He was ambassador to England (1641-1643), lieutenant-general of Orléanais, Vendômois and Dunois (1645), and marshal of France (1651). Louis XIV made him knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit (1661). His friendship with HRH Gaston of France, Duc d'Orléans and brother of Louis XIII (Monsieur, the King's brother), was flawless throughout his life, and it is as a lieutenant of the company of the Gendarmes of the Duc d 'Orléans (in 1620) that he had huge commons built at the Château de La Ferté-Imbault to accommodate his company. His wife, Catherine-Blanche of Choiseul (whose godfathers are the Grand Sully and the Prince de Rohan), whose father is Charles de Choiseul, marquis de Praslin, advisor to Marie de Medici and one of the most remarkable men of the end of the sixteenth century), will be first lady-in-waiting of HRH la Duchesse d'Orléans. The château knows its apogee at the Grand-Siècle. The hearts of the maréchal d'Estampes and his wife, Madame la Marquise d'Estampes de la Ferté-Imbault, remained at La Ferté-Imbault, in the chapel of Saint-Taurin, under a moving epitaph. The full-length portrait of the maréchal d'Estampes de La Ferté-Imbault was made in 1835 by Jean-Léonard Lugardon on the orders of King Louis-Philippe. It is in the sixth hall of the marshals, the of the Palace of Versailles.
In the eighteenth century, the Regent who ruled France since the death of Louis XIV, renamed the regiment of Chartres-Infantry to give it the name of La Ferté-Imbault regiment.
In 1743, King Louis XV acquired the marquisate of La Ferte-Imbault for his mistress, Madame de La Tournelle, on whom he wanted to confer a prestigious title to present to the court. Madame de La Tournelle eventually became Duchesse de Châteauroux.
The last marquise de La Ferté-Imbault was Marie-Thérèse Geoffrin d'Estampes, daughter of the illustrious Madame Geoffrin, whose literary salon in the rue Saint-Honoré radiated throughout Europe and as far as Russia where the Empress Catherine II wrote to her as a friend. The beautiful marquise, whose magnificent painting by Nattier is exhibited in Tokyo at the Fuji Art Museum, enjoyed at La Ferté "the freshness of large chestnut trees that extend their shade at the end of the Commons". Her presence was, however, requested in Versailles, where, on the recommendation of the governess of the Enfants de France, the comtesse de Marsan, Louis XV asked her to teach philosophy to his granddaughters, the Princesses Elisabeth and Clotilde de France (sisters of the Duc de Berry, future Louis XVI). She also provided Madame de Marsan with texts for the little comedies played by the princesses to whom the Dauphin and the Dauphine (Marie Antoinette) were present. Madame de La Ferté-Imbault will be invited to the coronation of Louis XVI in Reims on June 11, 1775. Smart, a woman of letters having regularly attended in the salon of her mother most of the great minds of the Enlightenment (Diderot, Voltaire, Fontenelle, Montesquieu who was his tutor, D'Alembert ...), and never remarried despite his young widowhood (and several marriage proposals including that of Stanislas Leszczynski, King of Poland, and father of the Queen of France Marie Leszczynska, who called la marquise "his Imbault" ), Madame de La Ferté-Imbault was recognized for her culture and her moral qualities. Queen of the "Sublime Order of Lanturelus", brotherhood of beautiful minds, she knows how to resist the intrigues of the Court, and attach the friendship of the Royal Family (including Madame Elizabeth who wrote to her "You must love, said a princess. I go further, for I love you, Imbault, and I challenge and criticize and rivals, to find nothing to say to my tenderness ", and Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince de Condé, who invites her at Chantilly and will seek always with her advice, help and consolation) courtiers and favorites like the Marquise de Pompadour who was her friend.
The French Revolution saw the fall of the House of d'Estampes and the loss of influence of the Château de La Ferté-Imbault. Its surrounding village was then attached to the neighboring town of Selles-Saint-Denis. The two wings of the château were torn down. The marquis de Pierrecourt, son of Sophie d'Estampes, owner of the château, was imprisoned during the Reign of Terror. He sold the estate in 1807 to the Comte de Belmont. The widow of the latter sold it in 1819 to the comtesse de Grandeffe.
In May 1824, a rich English family, the Leeds-Kirby from Leeds, acquired the estate of La Ferte-Imbault and moved to the château. They modernized local agriculture by adopting English cultural innovations (forage plants and improving crops, such as clover and alfalfa) in their many farms spread over 5,000 hectares. The presence of this foreign family was unappreciated in the village. For example, during the Revolution of 1830, the population of La Ferté-Imbault, armed with pitchforks and spades, invaded the château and sought to lynch the fleeing owner. The Protestant practice of the family, coupled with a strong proselytism, led to serious opposition to the village community throughout the nineteenth century, as in 1868 during the construction of the new parish church of Saint-Taurin, built in front of the main entrance to the château. When William Lee died in 1853, his nephew and niece inherited the estate of La Ferté-Imbault and the estate was divided into two parts, the Sauldre forming the boundary. Mary-Ann Kirby received the château and part of the farms on 3,500 hectares, while Edward Howarth, his brother, received other farms and the area of La Place on the right bank of the river (on which a new château was built between 1880 and 1883), for a total surface of 1,500 hectares.
The village regained its administrative independence in 1860 but faced financial problems. The former collegiate church near the château was destroyed.
The château, whose land was significantly reduced after 1872 (to a little over 1,100 hectares), was bought by Comte Fresson. His niece, , one of the richest heiresses of France and owner of the Château de Chaumont-sur-Loire, married Prince Amédée de Broglie, then HRH prince Louis-Ferdinand d'Orléans-Bourbon, . Many trips were undertaken between these two châteaux united by family ties. The park of about 50 hectares was fenced at that time by a brick wall and embellished with ornaments.
The Château de la Ferté-Imbault, sold in 1900 to Dr. Georges Bouilly, then become the property of Henry-René Bertrand, and was seized by the on June 17, 1940, and saw four years of German occupation. The building suffered extensive damage during a bombing raid on May 8, 1944. In August 1960, a "sound and light" show tracing its millennial history was organized in the castle with the voices of the actors Madeleine Sologne and . It has since been sold to new private owners and is open to visitors during the summer period.
Architecture.
The present stately home is the one restored by during the first quarter of the 17th century and completed in 1627. It is a high brick building erected on an old mound leveled in a succession of two terraces above the moat.
The building is located behind (north side) by the two cylindrical towers of the sixteenth century that resisted the fire of 1562, and in front (south side) by two polygonal towers whose base goes back to the construction of the medieval castle. The facade delimited by these last towers is dominated by an imposing fore-body covered with a pyramidal dome and crowned with a lantern and bells (also called the bell tower). The stone appears in tables and alternating claveaux around the windows. Three slate roofs are built parallel to this façade
Several large windows of the eastern facade retain a Renaissance decor made of grotesques and historical medallions. This facade also has a polychrome grid and testifies that the stone was hardly used to play a decorative role. In the main building, were added two wings disappeared for one at the end of the eighteenth century and for the other at the beginning of the nineteenth century, following a fire (which also destroyed the main wood staircase located in the bell tower, rebuilt in 1830).
Two pavilions are built at the end of the moat: the first for the guardhouse and the second for kitchens with a well that still exists, and whose ground floor is vaulted by a series of powerful arches diaphragms in brick. The moats that surround this quadrilateral on all sides are built with a bridge that spans them. Four watch-towers (two of which are still standing) with domes are arranged, pierced with openings to allow shots, which stand at the corners of the walkway overlooking the moat. The roofs of the pavilions resumed the shape adopted by the fore-body of the dwelling and that of the escugettes
The bridge gives access to two large bodies of common, particularly remarkable, which frame the forecourt of the château: they served as stables and cantonment for the company of Gendarmes of the Duc d'Orléans that the marshal d'Estampes directed "the installation of the light horse that he maintains in his superb common is reassuring for all".) These outbuildings were to house a total population of 600 including officers, 120 horsemen, grooms, farriers and about 240 horses. These long outbuildings are framed by large pavilions covered with high eaves.
The farm with housing, barns and kennel was rebuilt a little further apart in the barnyard.
The magnificent red brick ensemble is typical of the classicism that developed at the end of the Renaissance and during the reign of Louis XIII.
In the mid-nineteenth century, when the château was owned by the English Lee-Kirby family, large neo-Gothic arcades were placed in front of the medieval base of the main facade, and the imperial roofs of the pavilions destroyed by fire in 1830 were rebuilt in the form of two-slope English-inspired roofs.
The area which now extends over fifty hectares is enclosed by a brick wall surrounded by the Sauldre. Marshal d'Estampes had French gardens (transformed in the nineteenth century according to the English fashion), built an orangery, and dug a vast 600-meter canal, fed by the river, which survived. A vegetable garden, a cooler, meadows, cultivated land and woodlands make up a romantic territory. A network of star alleys serves the park. Many species of trees are found there as well as an abundant game.

Holothuria fuscocinerea

Holothuria fuscocinerea, the ashy pink sea cucumber, is a species of sea cucumber in the family Holothuriidae. It is placed in the subgenus "Stauropora", making its full name "Holothuria" ("Stauropora") "fuscocinerea". It is native to shallow water in the tropical and sub-tropical Indo-Pacific.
Description.
This sea cucumber has an oval, cylindrical body, flattened somewhat on the underside, and rounded at both ends. It can reach a length of but is a more normal size. The adult weighs between . The mouth is on the underside at the front and is surrounded by twenty short, brown, branched feeding tentacles. The anus is dark brown or black and has no anal teeth, but is surrounded by five white-tipped papillae. There are Cuvierian tubules in this species. The skin is soft, thick and wrinkled, often with sand adhering to it. It varies in colour, the upperside usually being greyish or brownish, while the underside is a dirty white. There is often a series of dark bars in the transverse wrinkles.
Distribution.
"H. fuscocinerea" has a widespread distribution in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Its range extends from East Africa and the Red Sea to southern Japan, northern Australia and Central America. It is typically found on coral rubble and soft sediments, and among seagrasses. It usually occurs at depths of less than but can occur down to .
Ecology.
"H. fuscocinerea" is a detritivore and feeds at night, sifting through the sediment with its feeding tentacles, swallowing the sediment and extracting the bacteria and organic material it contains, while the sand passes on through its gut.
Breeding takes place in the hot season. The sexes are separate in this species; they climb to an elevated location before releasing their gametes into the water column. Females produce an average of around three million eggs. The larvae are pelagic and drift with the plankton. When sufficiently developed they settle on the seabed and undergo metamorphosis into juveniles.
Like other sea cucumbers, the tissues contain saponins which are distasteful and toxic to fish, causing haemolysis of the red blood cells, which can be fatal. The skin periodically flakes off in little shreds, and fish can sometimes be seen nibbling these. This desquamation may be a method for the sea cucumber to rid itself of metabolic waste.
Status.
This is a common species of sea cucumber. It is of little commercial importance to fisheries, but is sometimes used for food, especially in China, the Philippines and Malaysia. It may be used more for this purpose if other more palatable species become depleted. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of "least concern".

Quintus Aurelius Polus Terentianus

Quintus Aurelius Polus Terentianus was a Roman senator, who held a number of offices in the imperial service. He was suffect consul between the years 188 and 190. Anthony Birley notes, despite the lack of records on Terentianus' origins, "study of the distribution of QQ. Aurelii, and other elements in his nomenclature, suggest he too, like other men in key positions at the end of 192, may have been an African."
The "cursus honorum" of Terentianus is known only from a number of inscriptions. His earliest recorded activity comes from a pair of fragmentary dedications to various Roman gods he set up at Mainz. The one in the best condition, dedicated to Liber and Apollo, attests that he was "legatus legionis" or commander of Legio XXII Primigenia, then Legio II Augusta, as well as being one of the "fetiales". Senators rarely commanded more than one legion in their career; in compiling a list of all men known to have commanded two or more, Birley identified only 33 men. This only happened in unusual cases, and Birley explains that Terentianus was sent from Mainz, where Legio XXII was stationed, to Roman Britain, where Legio II was stationed, due to unusual circumstances. Either he was to replace the legionary "legatus" Priscus, one of the commanders of the mutinous British legions; or Terentianus was sent to replace one of the "equites" appointed by the praetorian prefect Tigidius Perennis, who subsequently fell from power. "At all events, Terentianus ought to have taken up his command in 185 or 186."
Birley suggests Terentianus held one further praetorian post, which was followed by the consulship. He was appointed governor of the imperial province of Roman Dacia probably before the death of Commodus in the year 192; his appointment may have been engineered by the praetorian prefect Quintus Aemilius Laetus, as part of his coup against Commodus. He was governor no later than 195, when the brother of Septimus Severus was appointed to govern the province. Birley notes that, despite indications he was on good terms with Pertinax, Terentianus remained in favor with Septimus Severus, for he was proconsular governor of Asia in the later part of that emperor's reign.

Robert Moore (gambler)

Robert "Bob" Moore (c. 1953 – 18 October 1997) was a New Zealand professional gambler who focused on horse race betting where he earned his fortune. Moore had worked with Alan Woods and Bill Benter to develop computerized systems which successfully predicted the outcome of horse races.
Gambling career.
Moore arrived in Hong Kong in 1983 with only AUD$5 on him. There he worked with Alan Woods, a successful blackjack player, and devised a system for betting on the outcome of horse races. Moore made a fortune and was known for his flamboyance. Moore allegedly bought a bar from the owner to fire a manager who asked him to wait in line for a pool table. Another story about Moore involved a Hong Kong pool bar called the Flying Pig. After being annoyed with waiting for one of the two pool tables at the bar, Moore threatened the owners that he would purchase the Chinese restaurant downstairs and open a bar with three pool tables, which he did. According to Woods, such behavior cost Moore millions.
Moore often wagered up to $2 million per day on horse races and received an annual return of 38%.
In 1990, Moore was working with Woods while the two had shared an apartment. Moore left Woods to work for Bill Benter, who had a stronger betting system. Moore later left Benter and attempted to sell Benter's data to Woods.
Personal life.
Moore married Joane Chua in 1996. He had a daughter from a previous relationship. Friends said Moore suffered from mood swings and refused to follow his friends' advice of seeking help.
Death.
In 1996, Moore had won approximately HK$40 million from a horse race. Moore later won additional races before his death. He had a disagreement with the Hong Kong Jockey Club resulting in him being barred from any further horse racing activities.
Moore committed suicide on 18 October 1997 by overdosing on sleeping pills and leaving the gas cooker on. Investigators found 10 empty bags for sleeping pills in the kitchen bin. He was discovered by his wife.

Lampadioteuthis

Lampadioteuthis megaleia is a small, colorful squid from the family Lycoteuthidae, it is the only species in the only genus in the monotypic subfamily Lampadioteuthinae, it is sometimes known as the wonderful firefly squid. It differs from the other species of the Lycoteuthidae mainly by having a hectocotylus in the males and by the possession of a rostrum on the gladius.
Description.
"Lampadioteuthis megaleia" is a small squid which grows to a mantle length of 40 mm. In males the right ventral arm is hectocotylized with an enlarged protective membrane over the mid-arm. It has four ocular photophores, arranged as three in a ventral line and one positioned laterally. The tentacles have five photophores which are set on a stalk. There are circular anal photophores on either side of the rectum, single elongated branchial photophores lie at the base of each gill, there are no abdominal photophores and a single photophore is situated to the rear of the abdomen between the inner surface of mantle and the viscera. There are a lot of functional chromatophores which are covered by a violet pigmented external skin. The males have a penis.
Distribution.
"Lampadioteuthis megaleia" occurs in the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean in the Gulf Stream and the northern Sargasso Sea and in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. Its type locality is the Kermadec Islands, in the South Pacific Ocean, In the eastern North Atlantic it has been reported from between the Azores and Spain south to 25°N while in the western North Atlantic it has been recorded at 40°N.
Habitat and biology.
"Lampadioteuthis megaleia" is found in the upper mesopelagic to epipelagic zones. Little is known about its life history but the 
violet pigmentation in the skin lying over its photophores is assumed to act as a colour filter which enables the bioluminescence to be a closer match to the colour of the sun or moonlight downwelling from the surface. The photophores of species of squid in the genus "Lycoteuthis" have a very similar type of detached filter. Small, less than 8mm in mantle length, subadults have been found which are very similar to adults, except that some of the body proportions differ, the size of the photophores and only having the large photophore at the base of each tentacle. The paralarva are planktonic.

Ruth Reese

Ruth Reese (10 March 1921 – 25 October 1990) was an African American-Norwegian singer, writer and civil rights activist. She was one of the first prominent black singers in Norway and was actively involved in the international fight against racism. Over several decades, she contributed significantly to the understanding of African American history and music in Norway.
Early life.
Ruth Reese was born on 10 March 1921 in Hayneville, Alabama to Sarah (née Hunter) and William Reese. In her childhood, the family moved to Chicago, where Reese attended school and sang in the church choir. Without adequate funds to pursue music studies, she worked as a domestic after school to pay for music lessons. After completing her secondary studies, Reese attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois earning a bachelor's degree in music.
Career.
After her graduation, Reese first worked as a physical training instructor and choir director at Madden Park, before being hired as a substitute teacher Throughout the 1940s, Reese performed in the Chicago area, entering musical contests, winning several local awards, and earning promising reviews. In 1949, she appeared in the role of "Mougali" in the premiere performance of the opera "Ouanga" by Clarence Cameron White. Earning acclaim and a scholarship for her performance, Reese moved to New York City, to continue her voice training with Léon Rothier and Lawrence Brown.
After her concert debut in 1952, Reese moved to England and studied Amanda Aldridge. Her European debut was at the Salle Gaveau in Paris in 1953. Though classically-trained, she gained her reputation from performing Spirituals, Gospel music and the Blues with their roots in African-American tradition. Touring Europe, she performed both on stage and on the airwaves in Czechoslovakia, England, France, Israel, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and throughout Scandinavia. She first came to Norway in 1956, where she drew attention for the color of her skin, often billed as a "negersangerinne" (negro songstress). At the time, Norwegian society viewed itself as homogeneously white and had not recognized its indigenous or national minority populations. Reese found similar situations to those she had experienced in the United States, when she was denied lodging numerous times. She persevered, making a name for herself and fell in love. In 1960, she permanently settled in Oslo, Norway and two years later married the bookstore owner Paul Shetelig.
Reese began publishing about racial issues in newspapers like the "Dagbladet". In a piece published in 1959, "Vår hud er sort" (Our Skin is Black), she addressed the Norwegian indifference to racist policies in the United States or South Africa, such as the selling of South African fruits and wines, and began to draw awareness of the problems Africans and black people faced. Public debate on race began for the first time, the University sponsored a series of talks "Racism and Democracy", and in 1960, the national trade union proposed a boycott on South African goods. Reese actively took part in the movement to raise awareness, giving a lecture "De amerikanske negrenes musikkhistorie gjennom 360 år" (The American Negro's Music History Through 360 Years) throughout the country, in which she explained the difference between Spirituals and Classical music. She felt that to be properly performed, Spirituals could not be sung by white interpreters because "[t]he tones are created in tears. One must feel this pain in the soul to make it sound right". In 1963, to show solidarity with President John F. Kennedy's Civil Rights Agenda and the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, Reese collected signatures on a petition and led supporters in a march to the Oslo home of the American ambassador.
In addition to her activism, Reese continued to perform throughout Norway and had wide popularity. She was one of the first black artists to become established in Norway and was a major contributor to the spread of African music in the country. In 1972, a collection of her writings was published in Norwegian, "Lang svart vei" (Long Black Road) and in 1979, she released an album "Motherless Child" in 1979. In 1985, she published her autobiography, "Min vei" (My Way), in which she acknowledged that her activism had impacted her career, but was unapologetic for speaking for those who could not "express their despair". In 1990, she produced the short film "Pride of Black Dreams" which presented a brief history of African American through song and dance. It was shown widely in schools and on NRK Television.
Death and legacy.
Reese died on 25 October 1990 while giving an address against racism to the organization SOS Rasisme at a gathering being held in Oslo in her honor. Reese's archives were left to her student Kristin Asbjørnsen, who has made recordings in honor of her teacher. In 2013, Asbjørnsen explained that it had taken her many years to absorb the underlying messages from the lengthy notes and old recordings she had received. Only then was she ready to release albums inspired by Reese's approach.
14 private photo albums and scrapbooks that she owned, are in possession of Byarkivet ["the city archive" of Oslo].

Ciğer kebabı

Ciğer kebabı (English: liver kebab) is a common type of skewered meat served in Anatolian cuisine, usually eaten with sliced onions, salad and bread.
Liver is served in different ways in Turkish cooking, and can be found on its own as a main course in a sizzling plate, or as a kebab on shish skewers. Ciğer kebab is not specific to any particular region of Turkey, but is common in cities like Gaziantep and Diyarbakir.
In Antep cuisine from the city of Gaziantep, the liver is often placed into lavaş bread with the option of adding mint, peppers and other complements. The dish is often eaten for breakfast in Diyarbakir and Gaziantep

Cyclone Hola

Severe Tropical Cyclone Hola was a strong tropical cyclone which affected Vanuatu, New Caledonia and New Zealand. Forming as a broad tropical disturbance on 5 March, the system slowly consolidated over the next few days before developing into a tropical cyclone on 6 March. Afterwards, a pinhole eye began to emerge and rapid intensification ensued.
Meteorological history.
During March 3, 2018 the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) reported that Tropical Disturbance 09F had developed within a trough of low pressure about to the northeast of Nadi, Fiji.&lt;ref name="TDS 03/03"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the disturbance had a broad low-level circulation and was located within a very favourable environment for further development, with low vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures.&lt;ref name="STWA 03/03/18"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next couple of days, the disturbance gradually developed further as it gradually moved westwards towards Vanuatu, under the influence of a subtropical ridge of high pressure. It was subsequently classified as a tropical depression by the FMS during March 5, before the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) subsequently issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system later that day.&lt;ref name="TDS 05/03"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
During March 6, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 12P, after its broad low-level circulation center had slowly consolidated and the overall organisation of the cyclone had improved. The FMS subsequently reported that the system had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it Hola, while it was located about to the east of Pentecost Island in Vanuatu.&lt;ref name="TDA 06/03"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After it was named, Hola started developing a weak low level eye feature, before it was classified as a category 2 tropical cyclone as it passed in between the islands of Pentecost and Ambrym. The system subsequently passed over the island of Malekula and moved into the Coral Sea during March 7, where it rapidly consolidated and developed a pinhole eye. The FMS subsequently reported that Gita had become a Category 4 Severe Tropical Cyclone and predicted that Hola would peak as a Category 5 Severe Tropical Cyclone. However, during the following day Hola's eye weakened and became cloud filled, as it stalled to the west of Vanuatu. As a result, the FMS reported that the system had peaked as a Category 4 Severe Tropical Cyclone with 10-minute sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). During March 8, the JTWC also reported that Hola had peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph), which made it equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.
Preparations and impact.
Hola raged over Vanuatu as a Category 4 very severe tropical cyclone at 07:00am NZT, and killed one person and seriously injured another two as heavy rains and punishing winds lashed the region. Winds of up to 165 km/h (102 mph) and gusts of up to 230 km/h (143 mph) were reported. Multiple houses had suffered extensive damage and countless trees and crops had been uprooted. School classrooms were blown off their foundations in Ambrym but no injuries or deaths were reported. The school's principal claimed that 20 to 30 per cent of houses within the region would have been completely destroyed after feeling the full-force of Hola. Heavy rainfall, damaging winds and bursting river banks rattled the region.

Società anonima delle strade ferrate della Lombardia e dell'Italia Centrale

The Società anonima delle strade ferrate della Lombardia e dell'Italia Centrale was a joint-stock Anglo-French-Italian private company formed, following the partition of the territory, and the railways built in it, under construction or planned, resulting from the defeat of Austria in the Second Italian War of Independence, following the convention of 25 June 1860 among the Ministers of King Vittorio Emanuele II for Public Works and Finance and the previous Imperial-regia società privilegiata delle strade ferrate lombardo-venete e dell'Italia Centrale.
History.
The complicated process leading to the birth of the company has its roots in the decade of 1850-1860. The agreement between the Ministers of Public Works and Finance of the Kingdom of Italy (newly established) on 25 June 1860 and approved by the Parliament of the Kingdom, consisting of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies on July 8, ratified, with the appropriate changes in the composition of the share capital, guarantees and representatives, the previous agreement that the previous imperial-privileged company had signed with the Austrian government on 14 March 1856 and with the Duchy of Parma, Duchy of Modena and Reggio, Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Papal States three days later, on 17 March. The Second Italian War of Independence led to the splitting of the Lombardo-Veneto railway network and the complex economic interweaving of the construction and operation of the railways.
The convention.
The construction of railways by the State became blocked in 1854, owing to the lack of available funds. A new law for concessions began the era of private railways. Much infrastructure was completed by private companies whose economic consistency was essentially based on Rothschild capital of the Viennese house, with not always quantifiable holdings of homologous Parisian and London houses. On 14 March 1856, a Convention concerning the recruitment, construction and operation of the railways in the Lombard-Veneto Kingdom was signed between the Imperial-Registers Ministers of Finance and Commerce of Austria and a consortium of financiers and bankers, including Rothschild of the Viennese, Parisian and English houses, Paulin Talabot and other Frenchmen, Pietro Bastogi, the Duke of Galliera and other Italian financiers.
The convention provided for in Article 1 that the State gives to the said lords the Railway tracks of the State located in the Lombardy-Venetia Kingdom with all their appurtenances, movable and immovable, excepting only that trunk which, starting from Verona, enters towards the Southern Title, in order to exercise and use them for the duration of 90 years. Article 43 allowed the bankers consortium to establish a company with residence in Vienna and to issue shares. The document provided for the obligation to complete the construction works on the sections not yet completed. With the agreement, the company:
On 17 March 1856, the Convention between Austria, the Papal States, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the Duchy of Parma and Duchy of Modena and Reggio was signed, granting the Marquis Raffaele de Ferrari, Duke of Galliera, the concession for the construction of the "Italian Central Railway" consisting of Piacenza-Parma-Reggio and Mantova-Reggio-Bologna-Pistoia and Prato. The guarantee of a minimum annual total interest of 6,500,000 lire was also granted, due to the very serious difficulties in carrying out the work. The company adopted the name of Imperial-regia società privilegiata delle strade ferrate lombardo-venete e dell'Italia Centrale as a result of this assignment.
On May 24 of the same year, the concession already granted (16 June 1851) to the Società Anonima per la Strada Ferrata dell'Italia Centrale regarding Pistoia-Bologna (and passed to the new company) was officially revoked.
The banking groups consortium obtained further concessions, such as Vienna-Trieste and Innsbruck-Verona. On 1 January 1859 the fusion between the Lombard-Venetian and Central Italy companies and the Eastern railway company (KKP Kaiser Franz Joseph-Orientbahngesellschaft) was constituted as the "Kaiserliche königliche privilegierte südliche Staats, Lombardisch-venezianische und Zentral-italienische Eisenbahngesellschaft" with registered office in Vienna.
After defeat in the war, and the loss of Lombardy, the Austrian government entrusted all the lines built or under construction in the territory remaining in its possession to the Südbahn (which was also majority-owned by Rothschild), subtracting them from the competence of Lombardy-Veneto (in which there was significant French and Italian capital).
The old company comes back to life in the Kingdom of Italy.
The defeat of Austria in the second war of independence risked compromising the project and related investments. With the border moved from the Ticino to the Mincio, the future of the project was in doubt. Mediation was undertaken to arrive at a new convention with the Italian State. Paulin Talabot was the representative of the Rothschild bankers. The maneuvers of the Leghorn banking groups, headed by Pietro Bastogi, were no less important. Other subjects were also interested, including Bartolomeo Cini, the first financier of Porrettana, and the Duke of Galliera. The resolution taken by the Italian government was to free the company from previous obligations and any form of dependence on Vienna, reconstituting it with a new concession. This was based on the previous one, gave new rules by which the company had to abide, and listed the railway lines that would be entrusted to it. As for central Italy, the company became a concessionaire for the construction and operation of Piacenza-Bologna and the line for Pistoia. It lost the concession of Reggio-Borgoforte but, in exchange, it obtained the one for the Bologna-Ferrara-Pontelagoscuro line, including the bridge over the Po. In 1861 the company was registered in the official share price list of the Milan Stock Exchange.
The SFAI takeover.
The following years were difficult and caused numerous disruptions. The law no. 2279 of 14 May 1865 led to the formation of three major railway companies:
The SFAI was established on 1 July 1865 with 1,057.5 miles (1,701.9 km) of line it acquired from the state railway of the Kingdom of Sardinia (Piedmont) (453.5 miles (729.8 km)), the part of the state railway of the former Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia (604 miles (972 km)) and some private railways, including the Victor Emmanuel Railway, and some of the Südbahn. All this constituted the network of Upper Italy and was added to what was already owned by the Lombard-central company up to Florence. Thus was born the Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (SFAI) whose members and financiers were practically the same as the previous company - a simple takeover with the acquisition of some additional lines. Into the coffers of the Kingdom came 188.42 million lire for the transfer of rolling stock and railway tracks to the newly established Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia. In return, it was given a 95-year concession. The Government also guaranteed the Company a gross product of 28 million lire for the entire network.
On 1 July 1885 the SFAI network was taken over by the Rete Mediterranea (Mediterranean Network) and the Rete Adriatica (Adriatic Network), with lines generally west of Milan going to the Rete Mediterranea.

William Coulter (Lord Provost)

William Colter or Coulter (1754–1810) was a 19th-century Scottish hosier who served as Lord Provost of Edinburgh from 1808 to 1810.
Life.
He was born in Edinburgh in 1754.
He had a shop and house at the head of Jacksons Close on the Royal Mile (now 217 High Street).
In 1780 he commissioned the building of Morningside Lodge (later renamed Falcon Hall) in the Morningside district. It stood on 7.3 hectares of ground between Canaan Lane and Newbattle Terrace.
He joined Edinburgh Town Council around 1800 and served as Dean of Guild from 1806 and as Lord Provost from 1808.
He was Colonel of the Edinburgh Volunteers (a militia). On 8 June 1809, in his capacity as Lord Provost, he laid the foundation stone of the new Edinburgh Asylum in Morningside.
He died in Edinburgh on 14 April 1810. He is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh. He lies beneath a table stone north-west of the church, before the lower terrace.

Cashel South African Air Force Alouette crash

On 23 December 1975, an Aérospatiale Alouette III helicopter of the South African Air Force carrying a two-man crew and four Rhodesian Army officers crashed near Cashel in Rhodesia after it collided with a hawser cable mid-flight. The accident dealt a severe blow to the Rhodesian Security Forces, then fighting bitterly against ZANLA and ZIPRA insurgents in the Rhodesian Bush War, for the officers involved were some of its best and would prove difficult to replace.
Accident.
An Alouette III helicopter of the South African Air Force (SAAF) crewed by an SAAF pilot, Air Sub-Lieutenant Johannes van Rensberg, and a South African Air Force (SAF) flight technician, Sergeant Pieter van Rensberg, was flying from Umtali to Melsetter with four senior Rhodesian Army officers as passengers. These were Major General John Shaw, Colonel David Parker, Captain John Lamb and Captain Ian Robinson. The Alouette III was one of several loaned to Rhodesia to assist in counter-insurgency operations during the Bush War.
Flying at low altitude in accordance with procedure and en route to troops stationed on the border for a Christmas visit, the helicopter flew into a rusty, long-forgotten hawser cable at around 10 a.m. on Shinda Orchards Farm near Cashel, just south of Umtali and 3 km from the Mozambican border. The cable had years before been used to pass logs down a steep slope and was unmarked on any maps. The airframe began to break up as the helicopter spun out of control and crashed. All on board were killed except for the pilot, who was seriously injured, losing one of his legs. He was fitted with an artificial leg and got the nickname, Peg-a-Leg van Rensburg. 
A combined funeral was held six days later, on 30 December, at St. Mary's Anglican Cathedral in Salisbury. A joint honour guard, unusual due to the rarity of four officers from four different regiments dying alongside one another, was provided by the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI) and the Rhodesian African Rifles (RAR). It was the largest Security Forces funeral ever held in Rhodesia, with a huge officer contingent taking part in the funeral procession. Behind the honour guard and the men's families, the top brass – army commander Lieutenant General Peter Walls, Minister of Defence and Minister of Foreign Affairs P. K. van der Byl, Commissioner Peter Sherren of the British South Africa Police (BSAP), Air Marshal Mick McLaren of the RhAF and the South African military attaché, Brigadier L. L. Gordon – led this slow march.
Sergeant Pieter van Rensburg body was flown to South Africa where he was buried on 28 December with full military honors in the Voortrekker Heights cemetery in Pretoria. The service was held in the Zwartkops Airforce chapel. 
Impact.
Shaw was the Rhodesian Army's Chief of Staff and thus second-in-command to Walls. Almost a month earlier, on 30 November, Parker had ended his tenure as commanding officer of the RLI whereupon he was promoted from Lieutenant-Colonel to the rank of Colonel. Robertson was the acting commanding officer of 5 Independent Company the Rhodesia Regiment, and Lamb served in the headquarters of 3 Brigade the RAR.
The historians Hannes Wessels and P. J. H. Petter-Bowyer agree that the deaths of the Rhodesian officers, in particular the death of Parker, affected the course of the Bush War in the guerrillas' favour: Shaw was Rhodesia's "next Army Commander", says Petter-Bowyer, and Parker "its finest field commander". The Colonel was "earmarked for bigger things", Wessels writes, "... his loss was a considerable blow to the Rhodesian war effort."
Likewise, Peter Godwin and Ian Hancock describe Shaw as a "controversial figure within Army circles, disliked—by some—for his drinking and his manners" but nevertheless Walls' "probable successor". They go on to say "the loss of Parker and Lamb, on the other hand, was generally regarded as a grievous blow."

The genus " Halmaheramys" was originally thought to include only one species, endemic to Halmahera, giving the genus its scientific name. This new species extends the distribution to two more islands in the Maluku Archipelago.
It was first found in January 1990 by researchers T. Flannery and Boeadi, when they found a badly decomposed body of a rat on the island of Bisa. Later, in 2013, the authors collected further three specimens from Obi Island.

Berry Plan

The Berry Plan was a Vietnam War-era program in the United States that allowed physicians to defer obligatory military service until they had completed medical school and residency training. More than 42,000 physicians and surgeons were affected by the Berry Plan, named after Dr. Frank B. Berry, who served as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health and Medical Affairs from 1954–1961.
The Plan, enacted in 1954, arose out of a proposed "Doctor's Draft," originally met with objections from the American Medical Association, The Association of American Medical Colleges, and the American Hospital Association, who felt the draft would deprive them of a pool of young men who would staff their hospitals. The Berry Plan offered draftees three choices: entry into the Armed Forces after completing a medical internship, after completing one year of residency and returning to their residencies after completion of service, and after completion of a full residency program. The plan did not promise the branch of service or the length of deferral, rather the applicant was relegated to partial or full deferment. The applicant was also told which branch of the military he or she would be allocated. The applicants were not advised that if they signed before age 25 that they would be subjected to two years of active reserve duty after they fulfilled the active military commitment. the applicants were titled "obligated volunteers". The Berry Plan ended in 1973, with the last four physicians to complete their education and training entering the armed forces in 1980.

<doc id="56778143" url="?curid=56778143" title="Puławianie">
Puławianie

Puławianie was an informal designation of one of two peer groups of communists in postwar politics of Stalinist Poland, bidding for power within the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party in spring of 1956, following Bierut's death. They were known as the reformists during Poland's de-Stalinisation process. The other group, dubbed Natolińczycy, was known as the hardliners.
Puławianie united many party members of Jewish origin. The most prominent representatives of the Puławy faction were Roman Zambrowski, and Leon Kasman. The name comes from the chain of apartment buildings at Puławska 24 and 26 streets in Warsaw, which survived the war. These apartments were settled mainly by a very high communist party officials, in which some of the supporters of the Puławianie group lived. The opposed Polish clique within the communist party called them “the Jews.” Witold Jedlicki described the struggle between Natolins and the Pulawians in the booklet “Oafs and Jews”. (Chamy i Żydy)
A young group derived from parents who are members of the Puławians were connected with the March 1968 rebellion in Poland.

Daniel Therriault

Daniel Therriault (born 1953) is an American playwright, screenwriter and actor. He wrote the stage play "Battery" and the HBO films "First Time Felon" and "Witness Protection".
Early life.
Therriault was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. Since 1978, he has been based in New York City.
Career.
Theatre.
As an actor in Chicago's off-Loop theatre movement in the 1970s, Therriault was nominated for a 1977 Jeff Award for Best Actor in a Principal Role for "Who's Happy Now?" at the Body Politic Theatre. He portrayed Mercutio in the Oak Park Festival Theatre's open-air production of "Romeo and Juliet" in 1977, and did seasons at the Alley Theatre in Houston, Texas, in 1976–77, and at the Milwaukee Repertory Theater in 1977–78. After relocating to New York City, he performed in "The Mad Dog Blues" at Shep in Rep Rock N' Roll Theatre in 1979.
Around 1980, Therriault started writing. His first effort was the three-character stage play "Battery", a black comedy set in Chicago that would go on to win six Drama-Logue Awards. The play depicts domineering electrician Rip, who manipulates the lives of his girlfriend Brandy and manic-depressive apprentice Stan. Its off-Broadway run at St. Clements in Manhattan in 1981 was the professional stage debut of actress Holly Hunter, who would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress for "The Piano". The play was also produced by The Actors' Gang at Second Stage in Los Angeles in 1986 and 1989, directed by Richard Olivier and produced by Tim Robbins and Meg Ryan. Other productions include the Cast Theatre in Los Angeles starring LeVar Burton in 1983, Minnesota in 1986, Staatstheater Braunschweig in Germany in 1988–89, the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland in 1989, and Red Bones Theatre in Chicago in 1991. It was developed for the screen by Tony Richardson and Richard Olivier, but was never produced as a film. A 1986 "Los Angeles Times" review called Therriault's dialogue "a ripe blend of primitive slang and advanced metaphor."
His second full-length play, "The White Death", premiered at Kawaiahao Hall Theatre in Hawaii in 1986, and opened at the Cast Theatre in Los Angeles in 1987. Based in Hawaii, "The White Death" is a murder mystery in which a priest is sent to Hawaii to investigate a murder connected with his church. "The Honolulu Advertiser" deemed it "a controversial play dealing with sex, violence and God."
Therriault's one-act "Floor Above the Roof" was completed in 1981 and premiered in Chicago in 1987 as part of the Great Chicago Playwrights Exposition at the Body Politic Theatre. It was performed in 1989 as one of four one-act plays in the Working Theatre's "Working One-Acts '89" at the Henry Street Settlement Arts for Living Center in New York City. Revolving around four laborers in a Manhattan warehouse, the play is concerned with "how men deal with their hunger for women."
Therriault is an alumnus of New Dramatists, and received a 1991 McKnight Foundation Artist Fellowship and residency at the Playwrights' Center in Minneapolis.
Radio.
Therriault's 1992 radio play "The Hitch", "a darkly comic road adventure," was chosen to initiate Marjorie Van Halteren's new Radio Stage series on WNYC. It is a re-telling of an autobiographical event where Therriault was hitchhiking with a female friend, and a driver tried to kill him and rape her. In 2002, it was translated and broadcast on the German public-broadcasting radio station Westdeutscher Rundfunk. His radio play "Romance Concerto", about a concert violinist haunted by the memory of lost love, was performed on WNYC in April 1995.
Television.
Therriault wrote the script for the 1997 HBO film "First Time Felon", starring Omar Epps and Delroy Lindo, and directed by Charles S. Dutton. It tells the story of a young African-American's trials as a first-time convict. He wrote the screenplay for the 1999 HBO film "Witness Protection", starring Tom Sizemore as a mobster who tries to save himself by confessing to the FBI, with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as his wife and Forest Whitaker as a US Marshal, and directed by Richard Pearce. "Witness Protection" was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film, and Sizemore was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Television Film.
Personal life.
Therriault is married to Alison Mackenzie, a former stage director. They met in the late 1970s when she cast him as the writer Euripides in the play "October 12, 410 B.C.", which she was directing at SoHo Rep in New York City.
From 2013 to 2017, he was an adjunct professor in film and television at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts.

Tom Porter (computer scientist)

Thomas K Porter is the senior vice president of production strategy at Pixar and one of its founding employees.
Professional life.
After receiving a master's degree in computer science at Stanford University in 1975, Tom Porter worked at the National Institutes of Health on computer visualization of molecular models and wrote software at Ampex for the world's first commercial digital paint program, AVA.
Porter joined Lucasfilm's Computer Research and Development Division in early 1981. He and Tom Duff, another Lucasfilm employee, developed a new approach to compositing images; their 1984 paper, "Compositing Digital Images", is "[t]he seminal work on an algebra for image compositing", according to Keith Packard. "Porter-Duff compositing" is now a key technique in computer graphics.
Porter is listed as one of Pixar's 40 founding employees at the time of its spin-out as a corporation with funding from Steve Jobs in 1986.
Porter expanded on Robert L. Cook’s research into Monte Carlo techniques for image rendering, sampling visible objects not just (spatially) within each pixel but also (temporally) throughout the interval of time that the virtual shutter is open, creating a general solution for motion blur in computer-generated imagery. Porter created the image ‘1984’ as visual proof (and timestamp) of the breakthrough.
Porter's son Spencer was the inspiration for Luxo Jr.. Porter brought his infant son Spencer to work one day and John Lasseter, playing with the child, became fascinated with his proportions. It struck Lasseter as humorous that a baby's head is huge compared with the rest of its body, and he began to model a young lamp with that in mind.
Porter has received three Academy Scientific and Technical Awards from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his work with motion blur, digital compositing, and digital painting.
Porter worked on several Pixar films, notably as Supervising Technical Director of "Monsters, Inc." and as associate producer of "Cars" and "Wall•E", before assuming the role of SVP of film production at the studio.
Porter has an Erdős number of 3 in two distinct paths. One path is through Tom Duff, Porter's coauthor of "Composting Digital Images" in "Computer Graphics". Duff was a coauthor of "Minimal-Energy Clusters of Hard Spheres" in "Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry" with John Horton Conway and Conway coauthored "On the Distribution of Values of Angles Determined by Coplanar Points" with Paul Erdős (and H.T Croft and M.J.T Guy) in "Journal of London Mathematical Society". The other path is through István Simon, Porter's coauthor on "Random Insertion into a Priority Queue Structure" in "IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering". Simon was a coauthor of "Repeated Random Insertion into a Priority Queue" in "Journal of Algorithms" with Béla Bollobás. Bollabás authored 18 papers with Paul Erdős, including "On the structure of edge graphs" and "On a Ramsey-Turán type problem" in "Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society" and "Journal of Combinatorial Theory", respectively.

Aulus Egrilius Plarianus

Aulus Egrilius Plarianus, also known as Aulus Egrilius Plarianus Pater was a Roman senator, who flourished during the reign of Hadrian. He was suffect consul in the "nundinium" of October to December 128 with Quintus Planius Sardus Varius Ambibulus as his colleague; as the first of his family to accede to the consulate, he is a "homo novus". Plarianus is known entirely from inscriptions.
Plarianus came from a prominent family of Ostia, known from numerous inscriptions recovered from that port city of Rome. His father was Aulus Egrilius Rufus, a prominent decurion of Ostia, attested as duovir and "flamen Romae et Augusti"; his mother was Plaria Q.f. Vera. Through his mother's family, the Plarii, Plarianus could trace a connection with the Senatorial Acilii Glabriones: Manius Acilius Glabrio, consul in 91, had married Arria L.f. Plaria Vera Priscilla, another member of the Plarii. Plarianus had at least one brother, Marcus Acilius Priscus Egrilius Plarianus.
His "cursus honorum" is not completely known. Plarianus is attested as having been "prefectus" of the "aerarium Saturni" from the year 123 to 125, when his brother succeeded him in that role. Plarianus then entered the consulate. Both brothers are attested as two of the numerous patrons of Ostia.
Although the name of his wife has not yet been discovered, Plarianus is known to have had one son, also named Aulus Egrilius Plarianus, who was "prefectus" of the "aerarium militare", but did not advance to the consulate for unknown reasons.

William Dent (1800 ship)

William Dent was launched in 1800 and then made one voyage for the British East India Company (EIC). On her return she became a West Indiaman. She disappeared in January 1813.
Career.
Captain Giles Masson received a letter of marque on 16 December 1800. "William Dent" first appears in "Lloyd's Register" in 1801 (published in 1800). It gives the name of her master as G. Musson, that of her owner as J. Atkins, and her trade as London−India. (Subsequent editions change the destination to Bengal.)
Mr. John Atkins had tendered "William Dent", Giles Musson, master, to the EIC to bring back rice from Bengal. She was one of 28 vessels that sailed on that mission between December 1800 and February 1801. 
"William Dent" left England on 24 January 1801 and returned on 13 April 1802.
On her return "William Dent" started trading with Jamaica and the Americas generally.
Incidents
"William Dent" left Jamaica in August 1806 in a convoy of 109 vessels under escort by , , "Franchise", and "Penguin". On 18 August the convoy left the Gulf of Mexico. The August 1806 Great Coastal hurricane caught the convoy between 21 and 24 August. Some 20 vessels were lost, but "William Dent" survived. (Vessels lost included , , and .)

Allanah Harper

Allanah Harper (6 November 1904 – 3 November 1992) was an English author. She is best known for founding the journal "Echanges" (Exchanges), and for her 1948 autobiography.
Biography.
Harper came from a successful family and traveled extensively owing to her father's career as an engineering contractor. She moved to France as a young adult, founding the journal "Echanges," which attempted to give British and French writers an audience for each other's work. She introduced writers such as W. H. Auden, T. S. Eliot and Virginia Woolf to the French.
She made funds available to Sybille Bedford over a period of 3 years to enable her to write her first book.&lt;Sybille Bedford Quicksand, A Memoir&gt;
Harper married Robert Statlender at the start of World War II. The couple moved to America before splitting, and afterwards she moved back to France. She remained there for the rest of her life, though she visited London frequently. She was friends with the poet Brian Howard. Harper later contributed useful anecdotes for Marie-Jaqueline Lancaster's biography of Brian Howard. However Harper objected to him being called a "failure" and to Lancaster's emphasis on his homosexuality which she considered to be an "illness" and something that should not be drawn attention to.
Harper published an autobiography in 1948. Her work has been archived at the Harry Ransom Center in the University of Texas at Austin.
Harper died three days before her 88th birthday on 3 November 1992.
Work.
In 1948 she published a book of memories from her childhood entitled "All Trivial Fond Records", named for a quote from Hamlet and in 1976 co-edited an anthology of Dame Edith Sitwell's work entitled "Fire of the Mind".
The "Des Moines Register" wrote that her autobiographical, "All Trivial Fond Records", "may well be the most charming book of the year." The "Chicago Tribune" wrote that "Miss Harper's account of her Edwardian childhood and Georgian youth is one of the most delightful we have read in a long time."
"New York Times" reviewer, Michiko Kakutani, found fault with her editing on "Edith Sitwell: Fire of the Mind".

Jessie Ace and Margaret Wright

Jessie Ace (1860–1936) and Margaret Wright (née Ace; 1854–1933) are known for their rescue of crewmen, from the Mumbles lifeboat, which had gone to assist a wrecked German barque during an 1883 storm at Mumbles Head, Wales.
Lifeboat rescue.
Ace and Wright were daughters of the Mumbles Lighthouse keeper Abraham Ace.
On 27 January 1883, an 885-ton German barque named "Admiral Prinz Adalbert" of Danzig was caught in a storm in Mumbles Head and wrecked just below the lighthouse. The Mumbles lifeboat came to rescue the crew. When the Mumbles lifeboat, a wooden sailboat named the "Wolverhampton", got into trouble Wright and Ace waded into the surf to rescue the lifeboat crew. They tied their shawls together to use as a rope and rescued two of the lifeboat crewmen who had fallen overboard.
It is reported that Wright cried: "I will lose my life than let these men drown" as she waded into the icy waters. While some claimed the story was apocryphal, their father confirmed the actions of his daughters, alongside those of Gunner Edward Hutchings, in rescuing two crew members from the ship during the inquest into the disaster. Four of the "Wolverhampton" crew died that night, leaving four widows and fourteen orphaned children. The same storm also wrecked two other ships ("Agnes Jack" and "James Grey") on the Gower Peninsula, claiming 44 lives.
Recognition.
While the Royal National Lifeboat Institution awarded a silver medal and £50 to the coxswain who had aided the women in the rescue, and issued a commendation on vellum to Hutchings, it did not officially recognize the sisters' role.
The sisters did receive gold brooches from Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, the Empress of Germany, for caring for the barque's crew. The women gained international fame when they were featured on the front page illustration of "The Graphic" in February 1883.
Legacy.
Clement Scott wrote a poem, "The Women of Mumbles Head", in tribute to their heroic actions.
In 2016, a blue plaque was erected by Mumbles Pier to commemorate their bravery.
Later years.
In 1885, Jessie Ace married John Dunstan at St. Mary's, Swansea; the two emigrated to Australia in 1889. The couple divorced in 1901. She died in 1936 in New South Wales, where she was buried.

Victoria &quot;Porkchop&quot; Parker

Victoria "Porkchop" Parker, stage name of Victor Bowling, is an American drag performer and actor who came to international attention on the first season of "RuPaul's Drag Race," and for being the first contestant eliminated from the series. Parker has been called one of the most successful drag queens in their post-"RuPaul's Drag Race" careers, and has been brought back to the show by RuPaul several times in homage to being the first elimination in the show's history. Bowling has appeared on television as both himself and Porkchop, and as a backup dancer for Miley Cyrus. Parker has also won over 100 pageants and toured internationally as a drag queen.
Early life.
Bowling was born in Anderson, South Carolina, and raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina. He attended E.E. Smith High School. He was kicked out of his parents' home for being gay.
Career.
Pageants.
Parker started doing drag pageants in 1990, with her first being the Miss Gay USofA at Large 1990. She has won over 100 pageants, including Miss'd America 2013.
Film and television.
Parker was in the documentary "Trantasia", which debuted in 2006. 
In 2008, he appeared in the documentary film "Pageant" with Alyssa Edwards and other queens detailing their experience on Miss Gay America.
In 2015, Parker made a minor appearance along with Chad Michaels in an episode of "2 Broke Girls". She was a backup dancer with 30 other drag queens for Miley Cyrus's 2015 VMA Awards performance.
Parker was on the E! show "Botched" (Season 3, Episode 4) to fix the silicone problems with his nose, including a point where the skin was starting to decay.
"RuPaul's Drag Race".
Parker was announced as one of the nine contestants for the inaugural season of "RuPaul's Drag Race" on February 2, 2009. She has been described as the season's only older and plus-sized queen. Parker was eliminated during the first episode, becoming the very first contestant ever eliminated in the history of the show. She was sent home by Akashia. Because of this, RuPaul always addresses her with "Hey Porkchop" during all of the "Drag Race" live reunions, starting with season 4.
Parker has been brought back on the show by RuPaul several times, in homage to being the first contestant ever eliminated. She appeared during the recap episode of "RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars 2" and was featured in winning queen Alaska's rap. Parker was also brought back for the first episode of season 10 of "RuPaul's Drag Race" to help judge the mini-challenge. In 2019 she appeared as a guest for the first challenge in the premiere of season eleven of Drag Race posing with Soju.
In the first episode of "RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars 3," Vanessa Hudgens lip synced against "Porkchop", an actual pork chop, which RuPaul said was Parker.
In March 2018, "Variety" said that Parker was one of the 10 most successful queens in their careers after the show. She has toured internationally.
As of 2018, Parker was still publicly vying for a spot on "". Daniel Welsh of "Huffington Post" wrote "we're surprised contestants like Jessica Wild, Ongina and even Victoria "Porkchop" Parker are still sitting on the shelf, waiting to be plucked up for "All Stars"."
Personal life.
Bowling was attacked at a gay bar which resulted in a gunshot wound and acid damage on his face, requiring surgery. He had silicone injections done by an unlicensed nurse in 1999, resulting in granuloma.
He was blocked by former President Donald Trump on Twitter.

Prostitution statistics by country

In 2012 it was estimated that there were between 40 and 42 million prostitutes in the world. The list of countries below provides an estimate for the number of people working as prostitutes in each country.
Methodology.
There are a number of difficulties involved in collecting meaningful prostitution statistics. For example, the greater visibility of some forms of prostitution, such as street prostitution, makes statistics on these forms easier to collect. However, in some countries street prostitution forms a much smaller part of the sex industry than indoor prostitution. Similarly sex workers with health, addiction and other support needs are more likely to be known to the authorities and hence easier for researchers to contact, but may not be representative of prostitution as a whole. National Ugly Mugs, a support organisation for sex workers in the United Kingdom, has identified several factors making it difficult to collect statistics for the sex industry, including low response rates, the small scale of research compared to the size of the sex industry, and the diversity of the industry. As a result published statistics are often conflicting and contested.
In countries where prostitution is illegal, the use of arrest data to create general prostitution statistics can be misleading. The majority of prostitutes are never arrested, and those who are, can often be charged with other offences instead. Class bias may be introduced into the statistics as a result of police officers being more likely to arrest street prostitutes than high-class call girls. In comparing one area with another there may be differences in the definition of a crime, the police enforcement rate, and the possibility of the inflation of arrest figures or the under-reporting of crime.
Due to the unregulated and often illegal nature of the work, only estimates are available for the number of prostitutes in a country. The numbers for a country can vary considerably dependent on the source. Some countries' numbers may suffer from poor methodology. In other cases, results may be influenced by whether the organisation producing the numbers is for or against the nature of the work. Where available, figures are taken from Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 2016 "Sex Workers: Size Estimates."

Florentin Seillière (3 July 1744 – 4 February 1825) was a French businessman and banker.
He and his brother made their fortune in the wool trade, and in supplying fabric to the army in the period before, during and after the French Revolution. They used their capital to support the Lorraine iron industry. Seillière was made a baron by Napoleon, and this was confirmed and made hereditary after the Bourbon Restoration. He left a large fortune when he died.
Family.
Florentin Seillière was born on 3 July 1744 in Saint-Mihiel, Meuse.
He was the son of François Seillière (1707–1749) and Marie-Anne Sellier.
His father, who was descended from officials at the court of Lorraine, had become a wool merchant in Saint-Mihiel.
The Seillières were a prominent Catholic family.
The family name had been Sellier (Saddler), then Seillier, and finally Seillière.
In 1769 Florentin married Jeanne Chevalier (1750–1802).
Their children were Nicolas (1770–1844), Germain Auguste (1775–1803), François (1782–1843) and Claude Florentin (died 1808).
Career.
Florentin and his brother Aimé (1742–1793) expanded the family business to become suppliers of clothing and guns to the army.
In 1776 the Seillières (Aimé and Florentin) created a cloth company at Pierrepont, Meurthe-et-Moselle.
They were successful in the wool trade with Germany, and their "lavoir" at Pierrepont soon became an important supplier of cloth for the army.
In 1787 Florentin moved to Nancy where he obtained letters-patent of bourgeoisie from consular judges of Lorraine and Barrois.
Later he was named "héraut d'armes" (herald), an honorary title that conferred nobility which would be inherited by his descendants.
The Wendels lost their forge and foundry at Hayange during the French Revolution.
In 1789 the Seillières obtained the lease of the royal forge of Ruelle, which had been managed by Ignace de Wendel (1741–1795).
Florentin Seillière helped the Wendels buy back their Hayange forge in 1804.
In 1808 he was chosen by the emperor Napoleon as head of the board of saltworks of the east.
Seillière supported Jean François Marin in his purchase of a large foundry in Moyeuvre.
In 1811 François de Wendel signed two bonds of 120,000 and 180,000 from Seillière in order to buy the Moyeuvre foundry from Marin.
Florentin's son Nicolas created a branch of the bank in Paris in 1798, and specialized in recovering public debts held by companies supplying the army.
Florentin's other son François-Alexandre joined his brother in Paris in 1805, and in 1808 founded a bank at the Rue Le Peletier in the 9th arrondissement.
François-Alexandre was an entrepreneur more than a banker, and became very involved in the textile industry.
Florentin's granddaughter became countess of Sommariva.
Florentin Seillière was a member of the electoral council of the Meuse and a knight of the Legion of Honour.
He was created a baron of the Empire in January 1814 on promise of institution of "majorat".
He was confirmed as baron by letters patent of King Louis XVIII of France in 1815.
His title was made hereditary in the form of "majorat" in 1817.
He died on 4 February 1825 at the age of 80.
He left a fortune of 5.5 million francs.

Lycoteuthinae

Lycoteuthinae is a subfamily of squid from the family Lycoteuthidae. They are found in tropical and subtropical waters. They are characterised by the possession of oval photophores on the tentacles, eyeballs and viscera in all species and on the arms, head, mantle and fins in some. Some species also show strong sexual dimorphism. The subfamily contains all of the species classified under Lycoteuthidae, except for "Lampadioteuthis megaleia" which differs from the Lycoteuthins by the bearing of a hectocotylised arm in males.
Genera and species.

Calgary-Falconridge

Calgary-Falconridge is a provincial electoral district in Alberta, Canada. The district will be one of 87 districts mandated to return a single member (MLA) to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta using the first past the post method of voting. It was contested for the first time in the 2019 Alberta election.
Geography.
The district is located in northeastern Calgary, containing the neighbourhoods of Whitehorn, Temple, Castleridge, Falconridge, Coral Springs, and the eastern part of Taradale.
History.
The district was created in 2017 when the Electoral Boundaries Commission recommended reorganizing the districts in northeast Calgary, abolishing Calgary-Greenway and shifting the other ridings eastward. Calgary-Falconridge took the neighbourhoods of Whitehorn and Temple from Calgary-East, Castleridge and Falconridge from Calgary-McCall, and Coral Springs and part of Taradale from Calgary-Greenway. This resulted in a district 13% above the average population, but the Commission justified this by pointing out that there were no plans to build new housing stock in this area.

Souk El Jomaa

Souk El Jomaa (Arabic: سوق الجمعة) is the first souk that was made in Sfax even before the fence and the Great Mosque of Sfax. It is located in the middle of the Medina, in the east side of the Great Mosque of Sfax, between the latter's path and Nahj El Bey.
History.
Considering that its location is not far from the sea, this souk was the destination of the village residents' products and other neighboring islands before the establishing of the medina.
It was named the way it is in relation to the day it used to open on which was "friday". It used to have all kinds of products until other souks were made and things got more organized and each souk had its own speciality that it was made for. As a result, Souk El Jomaa became dedicated to selling old clothes and furniture.
Today, Souk El Jomaa is open for all the days of the week.
Architecture.
The now-existing achitecure is different from the one it used to be. In the thirteenth century it was named "Souk El Kachachine" according to a document dated 1262. At the beginning of this century, a coffee shop, an electric light tank and huge water containers called Mejel used to be located in the middle,
During the Husainid era, a school that had a mosque for prayers and houses for the students of the Great Mosque of Sfax was established in the Souk. Also, on its south Mosque of El Turk was built, west from the school.

Haiku (Joey Calderazzo album)

Haiku is a solo piano album by Joey Calderazzo. It was recorded in 2002 and released by Marsalis Music.
Recording and music.
The album of solo piano performances by Calderazzo was recorded in August 2002. For the album, he played a Steinway piano at the George Weston Recital Hall in Toronto. The material is a mix of standards, Calderazzo originals, and one composition each by Branford Marsalis and Kenny Kirkland. Marsalis was also the album's producer.
Release and reception.
"Haiku" was released by Marsalis Music in 2004. The AllMusic reviewer described it as "thoughtful, lyrical, melodic, and a bit introspective", and suggested that its quietness prevented it from being more than "merely a brilliant set of restrained improvising". "The Penguin Guide to Jazz" called it "an astoundingly good record" and wrote that "There's no sense of right and left [hands] working independently, but rather as a unit". The "JazzTimes" wrote that "most of "Haiku" vacillates oddly between overstatement and understatement" and that the slower pieces were meandering and too long.

<doc id="56778565" url="?curid=56778565" title="Dalmacio Iglesias García">
Dalmacio Iglesias García

Jesús María José Dalmacio Iglesias García (1879–1933) was a Spanish Carlist politician, active almost exclusively in Catalonia. His career climaxed during one term in the Congress of Deputies (1910–1914) and one term in the Senate (1918–1919). He did not manage to build his personal following; in historiography he is considered a unique case of a right-wing revolutionary who strove to launch a Christian, violent, urban, working class, anti-establishment movement. The bid ultimately failed and in the 1920s Iglesias withdrew from active politics.
Family and youth.
The ancestors of Dalmacio Iglesias were related to Galicia. His paternal family originated from Orense; his grandfather, Victorio Iglesias Fernández, served as oficial primero of Tesorería de Hacienda in the city. He married Vicenta Pardo and the couple had at least two sons; both of them studied medicine. The younger one, Luis Iglesias Pardo, served as physician in the Spanish navy; he gained some recognition in the maritime and local Galician realm as author of scientific works on medicine, sanitation and hygiene in the navy, all published in the 1870s and 1880s. The older brother, Antonio Iglesias Pardo (1844–1902), opted for a civilian career; in the 1870s he served in Cáceres, but in 1885 he left Extremadura and returned to his native Orense. Until the mid-1890s he worked as surgeon in the city and in some neighboring locations, including these already in the Salamanca province. In 1898 he commenced practice in the Santiago de Compostela hospital, where he served until his premature death.
At unspecified time though probably prior to the mid-1870s Antonio Iglesias married María Asunción García Legond, a native of Santiago and member to another family related to military medical services. It is not clear how many children the couple had. Dalmacio was born during the Cáceres spell of his father, where he probably spent his childhood years. In the mid-1880s he moved with his parents to Orense, living at calle Cervantes 15. It is there where in the local Insituto – the secular secondary school – he was rewarded with high grades upon his bachillerato. At an unspecified time yet most likely in the late 1890s he enrolled at the faculty of law at Universidad de Santiago, where his career was punctuated by a brief period of military service. As a university student he performed brilliantly; Iglesias obtained governmental prize in course of the curriculum, was rewarded for his study on legal rights of married woman and got premio etraordinario when graduated in 1902.
Upon passing entry exams in early 1903 Iglesias was admitted to and moved to Madrid, soon to be placed as the ministry delegate in Barcelona. In ciudad condal in 1907 he married Mercedes Janer Milá de la Roca (died 1963), daughter to a Catalan Carlist leader and wealthy entrepreneur . Dalmacio and Mercedes settled in the Catalan capital. None of their descendants became a publicly recognized figure. They had one child, María de las Mercedes, who married a navy officer Federico Caso Montaner. Dalmacio Iglesias did not live to see his only grandson, Alberto Caso Iglesias, who would later become a physician. Dalmacio's sister-in-law María gained name as a Carlist propagandist and activist, while his brother-in-law became a locally known writer. Cousins of his wife and turned recognized Catalan artists, respectively a painter and a writer. It is not clear whether a well-known singer Julio Iglesias, who also originated from Orense, was his distant relative.
Early public activity (before 1910).
The young Dalmacio has early developed a penchant for letters and already in 1893 he contributed to local periodicals. During his academic period he kept publishing and founded an ephemeral literary weekly "Santiago". He practiced his oratory skills in Ateneo Escolar Compostelano, where he became first the secretary and then the president, and in Ateneo Leon XIII. Inclined towards literature, he used to read out his own poetry and wrote prosaic pieces in Gallego, his works were flavored with militant religious zeal. In 1902 he took part in the Catholic Congress in Santiago and presented a paper at a section dedicated to religious orders. It was during the academic period when Iglesias was fascinated by the personality of Juan Vázquez de Mella and got attracted to Carlism.
It seems that upon arrival in Catalonia Iglesias engaged in Carlist youth structures; in 1904 he was noted as giving lectures in Círculo Tradicionalista of Barcelona and in late 1905 he became vice-president of Juventud Tradicionalista in the city, delivering addresses also elsewhere in Catalonia, e.g. in Gerona. At the time the Catalan Carlists were more than ever prepared to swallow their skepticism about alliance with other anti-governmental parties, especially the regionalists from La Lliga; the strategy produced a broad electoral alliance known as Solidaridad Catalana. Iglesias spoke vehemently against this "hermandad vulgo pisto rabioso pactada"; his highly emotional harangues earned him attention of the Liberal and Republican press, as already in early 1906 he featured as a negative point of reference.
Apart from his duties as a Ministry of Finance delegate Iglesias practiced also as a lawyer. In 1908 he got involved in a controversial and widely discussed case known as "caso Rull". Rull was an undercover police operative who penetrated the world of Barcelona proletarian conspiracy but was himself charged with terrorism, perhaps related to some extreme party or organization. Iglesias first represented some of the defendants in court and later defended Rull himself in an appeal case. The two seemed to have developed sort of friendship yet the prosecutor had his way and Rull was eventually executed; during and after the affair Iglesias was widely quoted speaking on terrorism and related issues. The Rull affair gained Iglesias a name in Barcelona, since in 1909 he emerged as expert on "antrolopología criminal".
Once the city was rocked by riots known as Semana Trágica Iglesias voiced against "doctrinas positivistas" and secular teaching, identified as primary roots of urban unrest. In 1909 and in response to left-wing violence Iglesias engaged in Catholic social action and was among the founders of Carlism-related Comité de Defensa Social, an hybrid organisation with characteristics of a cultural centre, a mutual help organization, a militia and a trade union. As a joint CdDS and Carlist representative supported by other right-wing groupings he ran in the Cortes elections from Gerona in 1910; riding the wave of anti-Left backlash which followed The Tragic Week he somewhat unexpectedly emerged triumphant.
Political climax (1910-1914).
The 1910–1914 Cortes service proved the period of Iglesias' hectic if not frenetic activity, especially during the first two years of his tenure. Though he focused also on topics like the army and economy he was mostly bent on confronting the Radicals of Lerroux, whom he presented as a threat not only to public order but also to the entire civilization. His own rhetoric was inflammatory; Canalejas noted that in his counter-revolutionary zeal he was carried away by hysteria. Though member of the diet, Iglesias emerged as leader of right-wing Catalan obrerismo, a working class violent anti-establishment movement. Confronting both radical lerrouxistas and bourgeoisie La Lliga, Iglesias started to champion what looked like a nascent Christian, urban, aggressive, proletariant protest crusade. His zeal to do away with the regime would soon lead him to advancing theories of Carlists and republicans joining ranks to topple the Restoration system, quickly quashed by the party hierarchy and rejected by the Republicans.
Iglesias's name soon became tantamount to an explosive conflict. Due to violent language employed and logic which instigated rebellion his press articles gave rise to many official enquiries. In the early 1910s he managed himself two weeklies: "La Voz de la Tradición" and "La Trinchera"; especially the latter emerged as the chief platform of violent obrerista propaganda which indulged in "fantasies of civil war in which Carlism triumphed". Police prevented sale of his discourses and he was among the most investigated MPs, by far surpassing the first ever socialist MP in the Spanish parliament, Pablo Iglesias.
Almost every second rally Iglesias attended ended up in riots, usually between the Carlist requetés and the Radical Jovenes Barbaros. Even his expected attendance might have led to violent clashes, e.g. with two dead left in Eibar. He was a few times assaulted. However, the most deadly turned out to be a ; following his address at a Carlist rally hundreds of requetés and lerrouxistas engaged in a melee which left 6 people killed, the incident investigated later in the parliament. It is with his personal contribution that "from 1911 to 1916 scuffling and occasional shoot-outs between Carlist and Radical youth were an accepted part of the Barcelona scene", especially that in 1913 he hailed "the club and the browning, the two indispensable companions of Jaimist youth".
Iglesias' radicalism estranged the Catalan Carlist leadership and the regional party jefe Duque de Solferino a few times tried to mitigate him; despite being Gerona MP Iglesias did not head the provincial Gerona organisation. Iglesias himself started to dream of old-fashioned party leaders killed in a civil war and making room for the youth. However, in 1912 he entered the national Carlist executive and also in 1912 in Biarritz he met his king for the first time. He did not seem engaged in struggle for power within the party top echelons and is not listed as protagonist of a raging conflict between his old-time master Vázquez de Mella and the official party leader, .
On the verge of loyalty (1914-1919).
In the 1914 electoral campaign Iglesias stood as a Carlist candidate in Gerona and though proportionally he was more successful than 4 years earlier, ultimately he failed to renew his deputy ticket. It would soon turn out that he failed in his later bids – also from Gerona - of 1916 and 1918. Iglesias acknowledged defeat, resumed his suspended duties as Hacienda delegate and re-opened the law office in Barcelona.
Always skeptical about courting La Lliga, in the mid-1910s Iglesias started to lead an anti-Catalanist group within the local party. Though he declared himself a regionalist and even in favor of autonomy, by scholars he is considered a champion of anti-regionalist españolismo; opponent of the new Catalan Carlist leader Miguel Junyent and his daily "El Correo Catalan", Iglesias openly challenged his line of seeking understanding with the Catalanists. The rift became clear when in 1915 he founded "El Legitimista Catalan"; the national party jefe Cerralbo disauthorised the paper and threatened these taking part in a related meeting with expulsion; the meeting took place and invariably ended in riots, but the weekly was eventually closed after just 3 months. Iglesias found himself on the verge of loyalty to the party, yet Cerralbo preferred not to escalate the conflict; in 1916 he confirmed Iglesias as the party candidate from Gerona, which in turn triggered protest resignation of the local Carlist Junta Provincial. Iglesias kept lambasting a policy which according to him melted Carlism in a broad Catalanism; upon the 1917 emergence of he strongly voiced against the initiative as giving in to the likes of Lerroux and Cambó.
There were two other threads which rendered Iglesias a key protagonist of internal conflict in regional Carlism. One was his continued penchant for social radicalism; he remained active in Comité de Defensa Social and even built its militia, apart from reverting to a theory that the Carlists should close ranks with "extrema izquierda" in order to do away with the corrupted regime. Another conflictive issue was the Great War. While the party officially supported neutrality most Catalan Carlists harbored francophone feelings; Iglesias emerged as leader of the local pro-German faction, noted for his cries of "viva Alemania" and even for declaration that he was prepared to shed blood if the time comes.
It remains paradoxical that despite his extremely conflictive personality Iglesias remained on at least formally correct terms with other party leaders; in 1917 together with Junyent he entered Comité de Acción Política of the Catalan Carlism, a new body of somewhat unclear role. It seems even more surprising that following defeat in 1918 elections Iglesias managed to ensure support of conservative parties when competing for seat in the Senate from Tarragona; it seems that he owed success to Maura and his ruling faction rather than to his own party. During a short term between mid-1918 and mid-1919 he basked in prestige of a senator and contributed to a few legal solutions adopted, e.g. to the law on civil servants.
In search of a new political identity (1919-1923).
Conflict between the key party theorist Vázquez de Mella and the claimant Don Jaime, the strife which was tearing Carlism apart since the late 1900s, came to an abrupt end in early 1919: the Mellistas broke away to build their own party. Iglesias has always remained fascinated with de Mella yet he did not count among his partisans in course of internal conflict; it was only during the Great War that he emerged as key Catalan Mellista. In February 1919 he was expulsed from Comunión Tradicionalista and immediately engaged in work to built a new Mellista organization. After , leader of the Catalan secessionists, Iglesias was the most prominent exponent of the breakaways in the region and some count him among the most prominent secessionists also nationwide; some authors name him a leader of "dalmacistas", one of a few mostly personalist factions allegedly making up the Mellista group.
Upon expiration of the senator mandate in May 1919 Iglesias for the 5th time tried to obtain the deputy ticket from Gerona and for the 4th time failed; initially reported to run for a consolation prize in the senate from Tarragona he eventually withdrew. He contributed to local efforts of forging a new party within a grand right-wing coalition and specified his program as "religión, unidad de la Patria española, Orden social y Monarquía tradicional y, por tanto, regionalista"; indeed he supported the autonomous statute drafted by Mancomunitat. During a grand assembly of Catalan Mellistas in Badalona of 1920 he hoped they would serve as agglutinatory factor for all Catholic forces, yet such a union was slow to materialize: in 1921 he was denied the Maurista support during one more bid for the senate. As usual his appearances led to unrest, though in 1921 his rally was interrupted by his former darlings requetés, who shouted "viva Jaime Tercero".
In mid-1922 Iglesias was still reported as heart and soul of the new emerging Mellista party and seemed prepared to go to great lengths when seeking allies, most likely the Integrists; he admitted that having broken all ties with Don Jaime, he was prepared to recognize Don Alfonso as a legitimate king given he swears allegiance to the Traditionalist principles. However, at some point he apparently lost any hope about the Mellista project. Tempted by of Salvador Minguijón and other breakaway Carlists, he considered it a would-be embodiment of "sumarse al partido católico" plan. Eventually he neared an initiative to launch a non-dynastical monarchist party, though still remained cautious that the Traditionalists should not lose their own identity. In late 1922 Iglesias was missing among participants of overdue Mellista party launch in Zaragoza and joined Unión Monárquica Nacional instead. In 1923 he was once again rumored to run – as independent – for deputy ticket from Gerona. His political bewilderment was eventually terminated by the Primo de Rivera coup and ban on all party activity.
Primoderiverista and afterwards (1923-1933).
Iglesias had no doubt about adhering to the new regime. Already in late 1923 he took part in homage feasts celebrating Primo as savior of the fatherland; explicitly exalting "golpe de estado" he offered his services to the military directorio. During a 1924 rally of Juventud de Acción Tradicionalista he hailed the coup as doing away with the old regime and as a deed spirited by traditionalist principles.
Exact scale of Iglesias' engagement in the primoderiverista regime is not clear. He later claimed that during personal meetings with the dictator he had tried to impose upon Primo his own social concerns and that he had repeatedly suggested that the regime should lower the cost of life for the middle- and working class. Press information confirms only his meetings with the Catalan , yet their purpose was not revealed. Active in Union Patriotica, in the late 1920s he seemed less enthusiastic about the dictatorial regime and criticized the constitution draft as the one which reproduced most defects of the 1876 document; in his 1930 pamphlet, "Política de la dictadura", Iglesias charged Primo with giving in to capitalist pressure and abandoning the cause of the working people; another pamphlet read like an offer to a centre-left political party.
In private Iglesias was confirmed at his job of Ministry of Finance delegate to Catalonia; his career was not ruined even by a fistfight with another official over his allegedly unsubstantiated absence in the office, perhaps the last manifestation of Iglesias' notorious inflammatory personality. In mid-1920s he competed for position of Jefe de la sección de Hacienda and in 1927 he was promoted to Jefé Superior de Administración Civil in Catalonia. At that time he emerged as expert on canon law and author of a few related works, which probably earned him Cruz de Oro of Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice order, awarded by the pope. Indeed, in the late 1920s he was noted in public mostly as engaged in numerous religious activities. As expert in juridical science he edited a number of entries in "Enciclopedia Espasa", including the one on himself. Last but not least, he was not missing during the 1928 funeral of his old-time master Vázquez de Mella and the acts related. 
There is scarce information on Iglesias' public activity during the last few years of his life. Until death he remained employed as the Catalan delegado de Hacienda. In June 1931 he was rumored to run on a joint right-wing ticket for the Cortes and indeed later that year he was once noted as speaking at a Traditionalism-flavored rally, yet unlike many former Mellistas, Iglesias has not been reported as engaged in a re-united Carlist organization, . Since the early 1920s he was plagued by health problems, yet their nature is not clear and it is not known what caused his premature death. Many periodicals noted his passing away, including at least one Carlist paper.

Forever and a Day (novel)

Forever and a Day is a 2018 James Bond novel written by Anthony Horowitz, and commissioned by the estate of Bond's creator, Ian Fleming. It was published on 31 May 2018.
Plot.
A prequel to the events of "Casino Royale", the book recounts Bond's first mission as a double-0 agent, his status recently earned by killing a wartime traitor in Stockholm.
Set in the French Riviera in 1950, Bond investigates the killing of the previous man designated 007 and resumes his final mission: determine what is behind the sudden lack of drug activity in the Corsican underworld. He develops his affinity for high-stakes casinos and fine hotels, where he meets Joanne "Sixtine / Madame 16" Brochet, a former British operative who leads him to Corsica mob boss Jean-Paul Scipio. Everything appears to point to the morbidly obese Scipio, head of a chemical company that serves as a front for his heroin business, but Bond discovers a larger network of organised crime and an American multi-millionaire named Irwin Wolfe.
Background.
Following the success of Horowitz's first Bond novel, "Trigger Mortis", the author and the Fleming estate were both eager to begin work on another. The book was officially announced in October 2016 with a planned Spring 2018 release. It was also announced that the novel would be published by Jonathan Cape, the publisher of Fleming's originals. Like "Trigger Mortis", which featured a story by Fleming based on previously unpublished material for the unmade James Bond television series, Horowitz would incorporate unused Fleming material in the new story. In February 2018 the title was revealed as "Forever and a Day", and it was announced the story would be a prequel to "Casino Royale", Fleming's first Bond novel. Fleming's material serves as a story Bond tells Sixtine about a previous escapade he had at the casino where they met.
Horowitz auctioned off a chance to appear in the novel at an auction to support The Old Vic. Reade Griffith was the winning bidder and appears as an American CIA agent in the story. But Joann McPike also made a large donation and was an inspiration for Joanne "Sixtine / Madame 16" Brochet; "brochet" being the French word for "pike".
Critical reception.
Steven Poole of "The Guardian" noted that, contrary to Fleming's choice not to focus on backstory and to deal with Bond as a "fully formed force of nature", Horowitz is "taking a risk in writing" the novel set before "Casino Royale". He labelled the book "Bond Begins", a reference to the previously untold origins of Batman in the 2005 Christopher Nolan film "Batman Begins", something to which the 2006 film adaptation of "Casino Royale" was frequently compared. Though he criticised the way some of the classic Bond tropes are introduced in the story, Poole found the book to be "an enjoyably compact thriller, with an absolutely killer last line". "Publishers Weekly" called the book "entertaining" while noting that Horowitz "delivers a conclusion whose moral complexity will surprise anyone expecting an ending more in line with Fleming's own". "Kirkus Reviews" called the novel "crisp, unpretentious, and bound to please" fans of the character, but noted that while Horowitz hits all obligatory notes, there's "nothing here that would make the unwary suspect how fiendishly inventive Horowitz can be when he's not laboring in Bond's shadow".

Milan Bulajić (; 6 September 1928 – 29 November 2009) was a Serbian historian, expert in Holocaust studies, and Yugoslavian diplomat. He was one of the founders of the and The Fund for Genocide Research () in Belgrade.
Bulajić was born in Vilusi near Nikšić (now in Montenegro), the son of an educated worker and grandson of a "barjaktar" (flag-bearer) in the Montenegrin Army and later government deputy. He joined the Yugoslav Partisans at the start of World War II. He finished the Law Faculty in Belgrade in 1951 and received a master's degree at the journalist-diplomat school in 1952, as the best in class. He received a doctoral degree in 1953. In the period of 1949–1987 he worked as an envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Among other roles, Bulajić served as an observer for Yugoslavia in the extradition proceedings against Ustaše minister Andrija Artuković as well as an expert witness in his subsequent trial as well as the trials of the assassinators of Yugoslav diplomat Vladimir Rolović. He was pensioned in 1987.
As a researcher, Bulajić promoted high figures for the number of victims of the Jasenovac concentration camp. According to sociologist Jovan Byford, Bulajić belonged to a group of authors whose works supported the Serbian side against the Croatian side in a "war of words" which became propaganda war after the involvement of various state ministries. These authors depicted the "genocidal nature" of Croatian nationalism, as well as the role of the Catholic church in the genocide committed in WWII, while denying the existence of any form of anti-Semitism in Serbia.

2000 - 2004.
Two members left Sol Music Ensemble and Mehabadi invited two students of SOL Music Educational Institute (Houman Behzadi &amp; Pouria Keshavarz) to join the Ensemble and to form a violin trio. They performed and recorded SOL’s 4th album (“Gaiety”) in 2000
(by Hamavaz Ahang publishing company). Gaiety's cover was designed by Hida Behzadi using the picture of a painting by Bahman Mehabadi. In these years, the Ensemble's public relations was voluntarily and actively done by Homa Sadr Arhami, a music lover who always devotedly supported SOL Music Ensemble with her activities. Soon Houman Behzadi left the Ensemble to continue his music studies in the University of Western Ontario. So two other students of SOL Music Educational Institute (Nahid Abtahi (guitar) and Hooman Akhtari (violin)) were invited and the Ensemble’s form was changed to three violins and a guitar.
Nahid Abtahi, during the years of her presence in SOL Music, also took the role of designing covers for all the albums in which she played, often using the paintings of Bahman Mehabadi. Meanwhile, Mehabadi decided to establish SOL publishing company in order to publish its own albums
. Ensemble, with its new members, performed in many occasions
. Such as programs for Universities Music Festival
, for Mahak Charity's benefit
, and for Pajoohesh Week in Tehran University
and published two other albums in 2003. “Benedictus”
and “Creation”
were the first albums published by SOL publishing company.
SOL Music Ensemble donated part of the Benedictus sales to the earthquake victims of Bam in December 2003
. The 7th album (“Miniature”) consisted of several pieces of Azerbaijan Music
. In December 2004, SOL Music Ensemble performed impressively in Craiova Centenar Music Festival (Romania)
which made them more popular and more respected.
They performed the program in Tehran’s Farhang Hall (Fajr Festival)
too and recorded it as their next album (“Laudation”)
2005 - 2008.
In order to extend the Ensemble, two new members were invited to join the group: Amar Dadizadeh (violin) and Zohreh HassanNia (piano). Afshin Fatoorechi was one of the supportive people always giving his thoughtful advice for SOL Music's extension as an independent center. To celebrate “Mozart 250th Anniversary”, SOL Music Ensemble fully dedicated its 9th album to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Henry Purcell works. In 2007 it was published as “Empyrean”
. After recording the 10th album (“Song of Peace”), Amar Dadizadeh, Zohreh HassanNia, and Hooman Akhtari left the Ensemble to continue their studies. "Song of Peace" was published in 2009 and was dedicated to Professor Zaven Yedigharians (Father to SOL Music Ensemble, the first teacher of Bahman Mehabadi, and the teacher of many other great Iranian Violinists)
. Meanwhile, many concerts were performed by SOL Music Ensemble in different places in Tehran, such as in Germany Cultural Center, in Niavaran Cultural Center for the first Festival of Artistic Production, and in Vahdat Hall
, and in a few Europe tours
In January 2006, SOL publishing company participated in 40th Midem Music Exhibition, Cannes, France
. Later, Nahal Mohebbi (violin) replaced Nahid Abtahi (guitar) to change the form of the Ensemble to violin trio one more time. The trio held a performance in Tabriz Cultural Center
, being honored to have Professor Zaven Yedigharians in the audience.
2009 - 2021.
Still wishing to extend the Ensemble, Mehabadi invited new members: Arghavan Sabahi (viola), Sara Abdollahzadeh (piano), Paranshid Shokoohi (piano), and Siamak Soltanalizadeh (viola). Maryam Tajik, Babak Nazari and Shahab Abtahi were also supportively present alongside other members. At this time, SOL Music Ensemble held seasonal concerts in its own place
. They published new albums such as: “The Beyond” (Bahman Mehabadi, Pouria Keshavarz, Arghavan Sabahi and Sara Abdollahzadeh) in 2010
, “The Apple” (Bahman Mehabadi, Nahal Mohebbi and Sara Abdollahzadeh) in 2011
, “The Strawberry” (Bahman Mehabadi, Pouria Keshavarz, Arghavan Sabahi and Paranshid Shokoohi) in 2012
, “Bloom of Colors” (Bahman Mehabadi, Nahal Mohebbi and Sara Abdollahzadeh) in 2013
, “Aura” (Bahman Mehabadi, Nahal Mohebbi, Arghavan Sabahi, Siamak Soltanalizadeh, Sara Abdollahzadeh and Paranshid Shokoohi, by SOL Music in Germany) in 2015
, and “Liebesleid” (Bahman Mehabadi and Paranshid Shokoohi, by SOL Music in Germany) in 2018. Except two albums (“The Beyond” and “The Apple") whose covers were designed by Maryam Abtahi, the design of all the next album covers was done by Bahman Mehabadi
and performed by Shahab Abtahi and Siamak Soltanalizadeh. Since 2012, with growing popularity, they have performed regular concerts in Iran House of Music
, the Institute of Art and Culture
, and Iranian Artists Forum’s Shahnaz Hall
&lt;br&gt;
Along the regular activities of the Ensemble, Bahman Mehabadi’s live performance of Bach Sonatas and Partitas was decided to be published by SOL Music in Germany. Shahab Abtahi and Siamak Soltanalizadeh were in charge of preparing the live records for publishing. The album was recognized as one of the best Bach performances in 2015. The latest albums released by SOL Music are “Recital” (2020, Germany), which is the live recording of violin and piano recital by Bahman Mehabadi and Wolf Iysenger, and "My Guitar Favourites" (guitar by Bahman Mehabadi, 2021, Germany).

Theodore Frelinghuysen (New York socialite)

Theodore Frelinghuysen (April 17, 1860 – January 30, 1928) was an American clubman and member of the Frelinghuysen family who was prominent in New York Society during the Gilded Age.
Early life and education.
Frelinghuysen was born in Newark, New Jersey on April 17, 1860. He was the youngest of six children born to Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen (1817–1885) and Matilda Elizabeth Griswold (1817–1889). His father was a lawyer who served as a U.S. Senator and later as Secretary of State under President Chester A. Arthur. His siblings included: Matilda Griswold Frelinghuysen, who married Henry Winthrop Gray, a prominent merchant; Charlotte Louisa Frelinghuysen; Frederick Frelinghuysen, who married Estelle B. Kinney; George Griswold Frelinghuysen, who married Sara Linen Ballantine, granddaughter of Peter Ballantine; and Sarah Helen Frelinghuysen (1856–1939), who married Judge John Davis, and after his death, Brig. Gen. Charles Laurie McCawley.
His paternal grandparents were Frederick Frelinghuysen and Mary (née Dumont) Frelinghuysen. His grandfather died when his father was just three years old, so his father was adopted by his uncle, Theodore Frelinghuysen. Both grandfather and adopted grandfather were sons of Frederick Frelinghuysen, the eminent lawyer who was one of the framers of the first New Jersey Constitution, a soldier in the American Revolutionary War, a member of the Continental Congress, and a member of the United States Senate. His maternal grandfather George Griswold, was a merchant in New York City who "made an immense fortune in the time of the clipper trade with China."
Career.
Frelinghuysen was the Treasurer of the J. &amp; P. Coats Ltd., a large British thread company that was run by his father-in-law Sir James Coats and located at 347 Broadway in New York City. Upon his marriage in 1885 to Alice Coats, his mother and father-in-law wanted him to be brought into Auchincloss Brothers as an equal partner. The American firm was run by the younger brothers of Alice's mother, John Winthrop Auchincloss and Hugh Dudley Auchincloss Sr. (the father of Hugh Auchincloss). When they said no, their refusal ended the Auchincloss relationship with the Coats firm and nearly bankrupt John.
In 1906, he became a director as well as financier of the Brunswick Refrigeration Co., a consolidation of the New Brunswick Refrigeration Company and Union Refrigeration Company which had merged. The other directors included W. Campbell Clark, head of Clark Thread Company and A. M. Coats, president of the Coats Thread Company. Frelinghuysen retired from business in 1910.
Society life.
In 1892, was Frelinghuysen included in Ward McAllister's "Four Hundred", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in "The New York Times". Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom.
Frelinghuysen was a member of the Metropolitan Club, the Knickerbocker Club, the Union Club of the City of New York, the Harvard Club of New York, the Merchants' Club, the Country Club, the Lawyers' Club and the Suburban Riding and Driving Club. He was also a philanthropist who donated to the Floating Hospital and Seaside Hospital Fund in 1897.
Personal life.
On August 25, 1885, Frelinghuysen was married to Alice Dudley Coats (1861–1889) in Newport, Rhode Island. Alice was the daughter of Sir James Coats, 1st Baronet and Lady Sarah Auchincloss, an American. The wedding was attended by former President Chester Arthur. Her brothers included Sir Stuart Coats, 2nd Baronet, and Alfred Mainwaring Coats (1869–1942), who married Elizabeth Barnewall (1867–1940) (niece of Louisa Barnewall Van Rensselaer). They lived at 25 West 15th Street near Stuyvesant Square. Together, Theodore and Alice were the parents of:
After Alice's death in 1889, he married Elizabeth Mary "Lily" (née Thompson) Cannon (1871–1967), the widow of Henry Le Grand Cannon, on June 2, 1898 at Grace Episcopal Church in New York City by Bishop Henry C. Potter. At the wedding, his ushers were R. Livingston Beeckman and William Cutting Jr. and his best-man was Elisha Dyer Jr. Lily was a daughter of William G. Thompson and descendant of Elijah Brush, both Mayors of Detroit and had two children, a boy and girl, from her first marriage. After their marriage, they lived at her home, 60 Fifth Avenue and maintained a winter residence in Palm Beach, Florida known as "Southways," and another house at Tuxedo Park, New York.
Frelinghuysen died of heart disease on January 30, 1928 at his residence, 66 East 55th Street in Manhattan. He was buried at St. Mary's-in-Tuxedo Episcopal Church in Tuxedo Park, New York. Previous to East 55th Street, he had been living at the Hotel Plaza in New York. His widow lived at their Palm Beach home until her death in 1967, at the age of 97, when she was referred to as "a grand dame of a bygone era."
Descendants.
Through his son Frederick, he was the step-grandfather of Lilla Fisk, who married Harry Payne Bingham Jr. and George C. Rand in 1956; and Felicia Fisk, who married Albert B. Dewey, the brother of U.S. Representative Charles S. Dewey.

Indenofluorene

An indenofluorene (IF) is any of five hydrocarbons with formula , whose carbon skeleton is a sequence of five fused rings with 6, 5, 6, 5, and 6 carbon atoms; an arrangement that can be described as the fusion of an indene core and a fluorene core (hence the common name). 
The five structural isomers (regioisomers) differ in the way the rings are connected. They have unique properties, applications, and research interests.
The name "indenofluorene" is also commonly used for any derivative of those five compounds (which are then specifically called "parent" or "unsubstituted" IFs), conceptually obtained by substituting other functional groups for some hydrogen atoms, and/or by hydrogenating the methylidene bridges (thus turning them into methylene bridges). Most IF synthesis and research work is done on these derivatives
History.
Despite being first synthesized in the late 19th century by Dr. S. Gabriel when he synthesized the substituted indeno [1,2-"a"] fluorene (shown right), the lack of robust synthesis routes left this family of molecules unexplored until the mid 20th century. After Gabriel, the next major step was the synthesis of the indeno [2,1-"a"] fluorene in 1939 by Weizmann et al. Next major advances came from Chardonens and Ritter with the synthesis the indeno [1,2-"b"] fluorene and indeno [2,1-"b"] fluorene in 1951. Continuing with their work, Chardonens and Ritter, synthesized indeno [1,2-a] fluorene in 1955. The final regioisomer, the indeno [2,1-"c"] fluorene was synthesized in 1961 by Ginsburg and Altman. Since the fifties and sixties, when these molecules were first being synthesized and discovered, improved synthetic routes and instrumentation have allowed IFs to be explored for uses in organic electronics including organic photovoltaics, organic light emitting diodes, and organic field effect transistors. Even with these advancements, the properties of IFs have remained largely unexplored. This is likely to change, however, as improvements on synthesis and expansion of IF examples continues to be an active area of research.
Structure and nomenclature.
There are several conventions for naming IFs currently in use. The preferred version uses a [1,2] or [2,1] to describe if the orientation of the methylene bridges on the 5 member rings are anti ([1,2]) or syn ([2,1]). The "a, b, c" designation indicates connectivity. "a" indicates there are no carbons between the indene and the starred fluorene carbon. Similarly, "b" indicates one carbon and "c" indicates two carbons.
While indenofluorenes are members of the polycyclic hydrocarbon family, they are not necessarily members of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon family. For example, the fully conjugated versions, shown below, have 20π electrons making them formally anti-aromatic. 
Stability.
Because of the instability of parent compounds, most synthesis work and research on indenofluorenes tend to focus on the dione substituted IFs, the fully conjugated IF, or the hydrogenated (methylene bridged) IFs. Even in these molecules, though, stability remains a problem so it is not uncommon to stabilize the core indenofluorene with aromatic or bulky substituents, such as mesityl or triisopropyl silyl. Similarly, the scope of indenofluorenes have been increasing over the decades to include heteroatoms, such as sulfur, within the ring system. Other structural expansions include addition of rings to the outer edges, off the center and expanding the center core.
Synthesis.
There is no one way to synthesize each of the regioisomers and new routes are being discovered. Presented here are some of the published ways to get to synthetically useful versions of each IF. Preference was given to the most efficient way to get to the minimally substituted IF.
[1,2-"a"] IF.
The first [1,2-"a"] IF scaffold was synthesized by Chardonens and Ritter in 1955. In their publication, they showed two ways to get to the dione of the [1,2-"a"] IF. The first utilizes an oxidative cleavege followed by a ring closure utilizing concentrated sulfuric acid. Later they developed a route in which they condensed an indenyl ketone with quinolone base. This intermediate was then reacted sodium dichromate to produce the final dione in decent yield. Despite having multiple routes to the dione, the synthesis of the fully conjugated IF remained elusive until 2017.
Using the synthesis presented by Chardonens and Ritter, Dressler et al. appended various R- groups at the carbonyl to produce the diol product which was then reduced using a tin chloride catalyst to get to the desired product (below). The pure IF, with no substitution, was not synthesized due to instability.
[1,2-"b"] IF.
The first [1,2-"b"] IF, reported in 1951 by Deuschel and co-workers, used a route similar to the synthesis below. 
This route produced the diol which could be used to make various derivatives. The collapse method, like the one shown below, was reported by Eglington et al. in 1960. This method successfully produces the parent IF in approximately 60% yield.
[2,1-"a"] IF.
The [2,1-"a"] IF was the second one synthesized, after Gabriel's work, and was published in 1939 by Weizmann. His route is not shown here, as better yielding methods have been developed recently. Arguably the best route to the synthesis of the [2,1-"a"] IF is based on the work by Thirion et al. where they perform a Diels Alder reaction with 1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene and dimethyl-but-2-ynedioate to build the skeleton of the IF. The center ring is aromatized using palladium on carbon to get to the diester. Saponification is performed to get to the carboxylic acid. Continuation with their route leads to the dione, in low yield, using a hot sulfuric acid closure. From the carboxylic acid, another route can be taken. If triflic acid, trifluoroacetic anhydride, and zinc bromide were added in a sealed reaction vessel to the carboxylic acid then heated, the result would be the desired dione in a 90 + percent yield 
[2,1-"b"] IF.
The first account of this scaffold was disclosed in 1951 by Deuschel et al. Chardonnens and Ritter, in 1955, offered the better route (shown above) in 79% yield 
[2,1-"c"] IF.
The [2,1-"c"] IF isomer was the last to be discovered and was published in 1961 by Ginsburg and Altman with an alternate route presented by Chardonnens and Ritter. Shown below is the original synthesis to the [2,1-"c"] dione.
In 2012, the first example of the fully conjugated IF was disclosed by the Haley group at the University of Oregon as an unpublished work 
An alternate route, not shown here, was presented by Youngs et al. where they produced the [2,1-"c"] IF in a collapse method similar to that disclosed by Eglington for the [1,2-"b"] IF. The yield over the two steps was reported to be 91% 
Properties.
Properties of indenofluorenes vary significantly between each regioisomer and even within each regioisomer as substitutions change. Presented here are the general trends for each indenofluorene.
[1,2-"a"] IF.
The properties of this regioisomer are not well known as of this point owing to the lack of synthetic routes. That said, the [1,2-"a"] IF is the only one that shows centrosymmetry. Dressler et al. recently published a paper on the first fully conjugated [1,2 - "a"] IF, and within that paper, they found a first reduction potential of -0.67 V 
[1,2-"b"] IF.
The [1,2-"b"] IF is distinguished from the other regioisomers first by having rotational symmetry. In crystal form, [1,2"- b]" IFs generally show one dimensional column stacking., however, the stacking can be tuned based on the substitution of the molecule. For example, the addition of fluorine to the molecule resulted in face to face π- stacking. No matter what substitution is present, though, the molecules pack fairly closely with distances of about 3.30 Å 
Kamatsu et al., in their work with [1,2-"b"] IFs, have shown that they behave as n-type semiconductors. The best n-type behavior was shown in the dione of the [1,2-"b"] IF in which the para positions were substituted with fluorine, which was presented by Yamahita et al. to be 0.17 cm2/Vċs.
Cyclic voltammetry data has shown that various [1,2-"b"] IFs, can reversibly accept two electrons with the first reduction occurring at -0.8 V. The parent dione has a first reduction potential of -1.19 V, and halogenated versions reduce around -0.6 V. The fully conjugated version, first postulated by Deuschel in the 1950s, is believed to be even better as an electron carrier when compared to the analogus fullerene. This is believed to be due to a low lying LUMO, which was calculated in the Haley Group at the University of Oregon and corroborated by the Tobe group via crystal structure analysis. Confirmation of these low lying LUMOs wis provided by a tips acetylene appended, on the methyl bridges and the center ring, fully conjugated [1,2-"b"] IF had a first reduction of -0.62 V. The improvement in reduction potential is linked to the fact that the addition of 2 electrons yields an aromatic molecule with increased stability. However, the addition of the steric bulk required to make the molecule stable, lead to a herringbone crystal packing which is not favorable for electron mobility through the crystal.
[2,1-"a"] IF.
Similar to indeno [1,2 -"b"] fluorenes, see above, indeno [2,1"-a"] fluorenes show strong biradical character. This biradical nature is both an advantage, in that it is believed that [2,1"-a"] IFs will make excellent organic electron carriers, and a curse, owing to the decreased stability of the molecule. The first reduction potential of the fully conjugated mesityl substituted compound is reported to be -1.51 V. Other versions of this IF regioisomer have had first reduction potentials as low as -2.48 V. As such, little work with this regioisomer has been published to-date and its properties remain largely unknown.
[2,1-"b"] IF.
Similarly to the [2,1 - "a"] IF, [2,1 - "b"] IFs show a mirror plain of symmetry and strong biradical character. The first reduction of the fully conjugated methyl appended [2,1 - "b"] IF occurs at -1.13 V and the second reduction is at -2.03 V.
[2,1-"c"] IF.
Like the other [2,1] isomers, this version also shows mirror plane symmetry, and similar to the [1,2-"a"] IF, there is very little know about this molecule.
Applications.
Overall the applications for IFs are anticipated to be as replacement for fullerenes in organic electronic systems such as OLEDs, OFETs, and OPVCs. However, as IFs have been sparsely studied, to this point, actual applications and integration into products have yet to be achieved. Not all of the IF regioisomers are suited to incorporation into organic electronics mostly owing to difficult synthesis and instability. However, as research progresses, advances in synthesis are sure to be made. Similarly, as molecular libraries expand, trends in stability and electron carrying ability are likely to develop.

The Sting (musical)

The Sting is a musical thriller with a book by Bob Martin and music and lyrics by Mark Hollmann, Greg Kotis, and Harry Connick Jr., based on the 1973 film "The Sting."
Productions.
The Paper Mill Playhouse presented the musical in a limited engagement from March 29 until April 29, 2018. The score contained music by Scott Joplin including "The Entertainer." John Rando directed, with choreography by Warren Carlyle and music direction by Fred Lassen.
The Paper Mill Playhouse production was billed as a "pre-broadway tryout" but as of September 2021, the show is yet to open on Broadway.
Synopsis.
Chicago. 1936. Get ready to enter a smoke-filled world of cons and capers, where nothing is what it seems and no one is who they appear to be. Based on the 1973 Academy Award-winning film, "The Sting" tells the tale of a pair of con men, small town grifter Johnny Hooker and big-time hustler Henry Gondorff (Harry Connick, Jr.), who plot to bring down the city's most corrupt racketeer. The Sting takes you back to an era where jazz reigns, the stakes are high, and the dice are always loaded.
Musical numbers.
The score of "The Sting" features "The Entertainer", "The Easy Winners", "Solace", "The Strenuous Life", "The Chrysanthemum", "The Cascades", "A Breeze from Alabama", "Rose Leaf Rag", and "The Ragtime Dance" composed by Scott Joplin, and "Heliotrope Bouquet" by Scott Joplin and Louis Chauvin.
Reception.
The musical garnered lukewarm reviews upon opening at the Paper Mill Playhouse. Ghee received almost unanimously positive reviews, with one critic saying Ghee "has charisma to spare and estimable singing and dancing chops." Connick, Jr. received mixed to positive reviews, with multiple critics claiming him to be charming, if not quite as charismatic as his film counterpart. Much of the supporting cast, specifically Shindle and Hewitt, were praised for their performances. Warren Carlyle's choreography was also very warmly received.
Conversely, many critics called the direction and production bland and uninspired and the music forgettable. Bob Martin's book was also panned as not up to his usual comedic standards.

Yorkshire Universities Air Squadron

The Yorkshire Universities Air Squadron (more commonly known as YUAS) is a Royal Air Force flying training unit that currently operates out of RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, England. One of fourteen University Air Squadrons, the unit traditionally recruits students from universities across the Yorkshire and Humber region and provides bursaries for those who wish to pursue a career in the Royal Air Force.
History.
YUAS was formed in 1969 when the University Air Squadron (UAS) from Hull and the UAS from Leeds, were combined to make YUAS. Leeds UAS was formed in January 1941 and had been allocated to airfields at Sherburn-in-Elmet and RAF Yeadon. Whilst at Yeadon, the squadron represented the final RAF presence when the airfield had gone over to a commercial operation as (what is now) Leeds Bradford Airport. Hull UAS was formed at RAF Driffield, but flew out of Leconfield and Brough. With the amalgamation of the two squadrons in 1969, flying was retained at RAF Leconfield for students from Hull University. As a formed squadron, YUAS first flew from RAF Church Fenton between 1969 and 1975. When Church Fenton was placed under a care and maintenance programme as a Relief Landing Ground (RLG) for RAF Linton-on-Ouse, the squadron moved to RAF Finningley in 1975. It returned to a resurgent Church Fenton in 1995 when RAF Finningley was closed.
YUAS is one of fourteen University Air Squadrons that are spread out across Great Britain and it recruits from the universities at Bradford, Huddersfield, Hull, Leeds, Sheffield and York, with about 30 new intakes every year. Alongside the original universities that were listed for YUAS, students from Sheffield Hallam, Leeds College of Music, Leeds Metropolitan University and York St John University, can also apply to join YUAS. Students who join YUAS are enlisted as Officer Cadets in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and receive 30 hours of flying training annually.
In 1998, a contract was signed to replace the Bulldog trainer aircraft with the Grob G115 (Tutor). A private company, Vosper Thorneycroft, were contracted to supply maintenance on the aircraft through a private contract. The Tutor aircraft was delivered to the University Air Squadrons from July 1999 onwards.
In 2013, it was announced that RAF Church Fenton would be closing down and that all units would need to be transferred elsewhere. In the case of YUAS and No. 9 Air Experience Flight RAF, this would mean a transfer to RAF Linton-on-Ouse, some north-west of York. In 2014, a year after moving to Linton-on-Ouse, YUAS won the best University Air Squadron beating 13 other University Air Squadrons across Great Britain.
Due to the closure of RAF Linton-on-Ouse in 2021, YUAS relocated to RAF Leeming on 1 December 2020. An announcement was made on the day that YUAS will operate alongside Northumbrian Universities Air Squadron at RAF Leeming.

Minnie Emmett was a singer and pioneer recording artist active in New York in the 1890s and 1900s.
Emmett was not the first woman to make commercial records, but was the first to gain prominence and influence in the field. A July 1898 article in "Phonoscope" called her "the most successful and the most popular woman engaged in record making". Her first recordings, published by the United States Phonograph Company in 1894 or 1895, were advertised as "the first true records of a high soprano voice". She sang popular sentimental and comic songs like "Sweet Marie" and "The Sunshine of Paradise Alley" and remained in the United States catalog until joining the Columbia Phonograph Company in 1898 and adding operatic solos and duets (with Roger Harding) and older standards (Ben Bolt, Robin Adair, Foster's songs) to her repertoire. She continued recording into the early 1900s, making discs for Columbia and Victor of similar material. She recorded a few cylinders for the U.S. Everlasting company around 1910.
Emmett also sang in productions of the Duquesne Garden Stock Opera Company and the Graw Opera Company.
Though many details of her personal life are unclear, recording pioneer Albert Campbell told researcher Jim Walsh that he'd seen Emmett in a home for retired actors in the late 1930s.

Biomolecular condensate

Biomolecular condensates are a class of non-membrane bounded organelles and organelle subdomains, specified by physical concepts that date back a long way. As with other organelles, biomolecular condensates are specialized subunits of the cell. However, unlike many organelles, biomolecular condensate composition is not controlled by a bounding membrane. Instead they can form through a range of different processes, the most well-known of which is phase separation of proteins, RNA and other biopolymers into either colloidal emulsions, liquid crystals, solid crystals or aggregates within cells.
History.
Micellar theory.
The micellar theory of Carl Nägeli was developed from his detailed study of starch granules in 1858. Amorphous substances such as starch and cellulose were proposed to consist of building blocks, packed in a loosely crystalline array to form which he later termed “micelles”. Water could penetrate between the micelles, and new micelles could form in the interstices between old micelles. The swelling of starch grains and their growth was described by a molecular-aggregate model, which he also applied to the cellulose of the plant cell wall. The modern usage of 'micelle' refers strictly to lipids, but its original usage clearly extended to other types of biomolecule, and this legacy is reflected to this day in the description of milk as being composed of 'casein micelles'.
Colloidal phase separation theory.
The term 'colloid' was coined by Wolfgang Ostwald and defined by Thomas Graham in 1861 to describe the behaviour of certain biological macromolecules (starch, albumin, gelatin, etc.) and inorganic molecules as slowly diffusing components of cloudy liquid solution-suspensions that were blocked by semi-permeable membranes, while the physics of phase separation was described by Josiah Willard Gibbs in his landmark paper titled "On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances", published in parts between 1875 and 1878. Influenced by Willard Gibbs, important contributions were also made by Johannes Diderik van der Waals, who in 1890 published a treatise on the "Theory of Binary Solutions".
The concept of intracellular colloids as an organizing principle for the compartmentalization of living cells dates back to the end of the 19th century, beginning with William Bate Hardy and Edmund Beecher Wilson who described the cytoplasm (then called 'protoplasm') as a colloid. Around the same time, Thomas Harrison Montgomery Jr. described the morphology of the nucleolus, an organelle within the nucleus, which has subsequently been shown to form through intracellular phase separation. WB Hardy linked formation of biological colloids with phase separation in his study of globulins, stating that: "The globulin is dispersed in the solvent as particles which are the colloid particles and which are so large as to form an internal phase", and further contributed to the basic physical description of oil-water phase separation.
Colloidal phase separation as a driving force in cellular organisation appealed strongly to Stephane Leduc, who wrote in his influential 1911 book "The Mechanism of Life": "Hence the study of life may be best begun by the study of those physico-chemical phenomena which result from the contact of two different liquids. Biology is thus but a branch of the physico-chemistry of liquids; it includes the study of electrolytic and colloidal solutions, and of the molecular forces brought into play by solution, osmosis, diffusion, cohesion, and crystallization."
The primordial soup theory of the origin of life, proposed by Alexander Oparin in Russian in 1924 (published in English in 1936) and by J.B.S. Haldane in 1929, suggested that life was preceded by the formation of what Haldane called a "hot dilute soup" of "colloidal organic substances", and which Oparin referred to as 'coacervates' (after de Jong ) - particles composed of two or more colloids which might be protein, lipid or nucleic acid. These ideas strongly influenced the subsequent work of Sidney W. Fox on proteinoid microspheres.
Molecular biology.
In 1922, Hermann Staudinger refined the colloidal association theory of Thomas Graham by proposing that certain colloids were composed of high molecular weight polymers (chains linked by covalent bonds), which he termed 'macromolecules' to distinguish them from colloidal clusters of lower molecular weight molecules. So strongly held was colloidal association theory that even Emil Fischer, who had concluded that proteins are polypeptides formed by covalent bonds between amino acid units in 1906, initially refused to believe in the existence of high molecular weight polymers. Staudinger eventually received the Nobel Prize in 1953. Importantly, the discovery of high molecular weight macromolecular polymers cast doubt on the universality of colloidal phase separation in biology, despite the fact that individual polymers could still be observed to associate by clustering and phase separation to form colloids, liquid crystals, solid crystals or aggregates.
A far greater impact occurred when Frederick Sanger determined the amino acid sequence of Insulin and Linus Pauling, Robert Corey and Herman Branson correctly proposed the alpha helix and beta sheet as the primary structural motifs in protein secondary structure, while Max Perutz and John Kendrew analysed the 3D structure of myoglobin and later haemoglobin. These breakthroughs in protein structure determination led to a general focus of biologists on atomic-scale amino acid sequence- and 3D conformation-specific protein-protein interactions of a lock and key model type, usually between defined numbers of interacting subunits within a stoichiometric complex. Together with Staudinger's Nobel Prize in 1953 this new approach led to a reduced interest in biopolymers as colloids in biology, apart from their propensity to form solid crystals for structure determination by X-ray crystallography. Nevertheless, the fields of colloid chemistry and polymer physics continued unabated to characterise the non-stoichiometric interactions occurring during colloidal, liquid crystal and other phase behaviour of macromolecular polymers, particularly synthetic polymers developed for industrial applications.
Support from other disciplines.
When cell biologists largely abandoned colloidal phase separation, it was left to relative outsiders - agricultural scientists and physicists - to make further progress in the study of phase separating biomolecules in cells.
Beginning in the early 1970s, Harold M Farrell Jr. at the US Department of Agriculture developed a colloidal phase separation model for milk casein micelles that form within mammary gland cells before secretion as milk.
Also in the 1970s, physicists Tanaka &amp; Benedek at MIT identified phase-separation behaviour of gamma-crystallin proteins from lens epithelial cells and cataracts in solution, which Benedek referred to as 'protein condensation'.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Athene Donald's polymer physics lab in Cambridge extensively characterised phase transitions / phase separation of starch granules from the cytoplasm of plant cells, which behave as liquid crystals.
In 1991, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes received the Nobel Prize in Physics for developing a generalized theory of phase transitions with particular applications to describing ordering and phase transitions in polymers. Unfortunately, de Gennes wrote in "Nature" that polymers should be distinguished from other types of colloids, even though they can display similar clustering and phase separation behaviour, a stance that has been reflected in the reduced usage of the term colloid to describe the higher-order association behaviour of biopolymers in modern cell biology and molecular self-assembly.
Phase separation revisited.
Advances in confocal microscopy at the end of the 20th century identified proteins, RNA or carbohydrates localising to many non-membrane bound cellular compartments within the cytoplasm or nucleus which were variously referred to as 'puncta/dots', 'signalosomes', 'granules', 'bodies', 'assemblies', 'paraspeckles', 'purinosomes', 'inclusions', 'aggregates' or 'factories'. During this time period (1995-2008) the concept of phase separation was re-borrowed from colloidal chemistry &amp; polymer physics and proposed to underlie both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartmentalization.
Since 2009, further evidence for biomacromolecules undergoing intracellular phase transitions (phase separation) has been observed in many different contexts, both within cells and in reconstituted "in vitro" experiments.
The newly coined term "biomolecular condensate" refers to biological polymers (as opposed to synthetic polymers) that undergo self assembly via clustering to increase the local concentration of the assembling components, and is analogous to the physical definition of condensation.
In physics, condensation typically refers to a gas-liquid phase transition.
In biology the term 'condensation' is used much more broadly and can also refer to liquid-liquid phase separation to form colloidal emulsions or liquid crystals within cells, and liquid-solid phase separation to form gels, sols, or suspensions within cells as well as liquid-to-solid phase transitions such as DNA condensation during prophase of the cell cycle or protein condensation of crystallins in cataracts. With this in mind, the term 'biomolecular condensates' was deliberately introduced to reflect this breadth (see below). Since biomolecular condensation generally involves oligomeric or polymeric interactions between an indefinite number of components, it is generally considered distinct from formation of smaller stoichiometric protein complexes with defined numbers of subunits, such as viral capsids or the proteasome - although both are examples of spontaneous molecular self-assembly or self-organisation.
Mechanistically, it appears that the conformational landscape (in particular, whether it is enriched in extended disordered states) and multivalent interactions between intrinsically disordered proteins (including cross-beta polymerisation), and/or protein domains that induce head-to-tail oligomeric or polymeric clustering, might play a role in phase separation of proteins.
Examples.
Many examples of biomolecular condensates have been characterized in the cytoplasm and the nucleus that are thought to arise by either liquid-liquid or liquid-solid phase separation.
Nuclear condensates.
Other nuclear structures including heterochromatin and DNA condensation in condensed mitosis chromosomes form by mechanisms similar to phase separation, so can also be classified as biomolecular condensates.
Lipid enclosed organelles and lipoproteins are not considered condensates.
Typical organelles or endosomes enclosed by a lipid bilayer are not considered biomolecular condensates. In addition, lipid droplets are surrounded by a lipid monolayer in the cytoplasm, or in milk, or in tears, so appear to fall under the 'membrane bound' category. Finally, secreted LDL and HDL lipoprotein particles are also enclosed by a lipid monolayer. The formation of these structures involves phase separation to from colloidal micelles or liquid crystal bilayers, but they are not classified as biomolecular condensates, as this term is reserved for non-membrane bound organelles.
Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in biology.
Liquid biomolecular condensates.
Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) generates a subtype of colloid known as an emulsion that can coalesce to from large droplets within a liquid. Ordering of molecules during liquid-liquid phase separation can generate liquid crystals rather than emulsions. In cells, LLPS produces a liquid subclass of biomolecular condensate that can behave as either an emulsion or liquid crystal.
The term biomolecular condensates was introduced in the context of intracellular assemblies as a convenient and non-exclusionary term to describe non-stoichiometric assemblies of biomolecules. The choice of language here is specific and important. It has been proposed that many biomolecular condensates form through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form colloidal emulsions or liquid crystals in living organisms, as opposed to liquid-solid phase separation to form crystals/aggregates in gels, sols or suspensions within cells or extracellular secretions. However, unequivocally demonstrating that a cellular body forms through liquid-liquid phase separation is challenging, because different material states (liquid vs. gel vs. solid) are not always easy to distinguish in living cells. The term "biomolecular condensate" directly addresses this challenge by making no assumption regarding either the physical mechanism through which assembly is achieved, nor the material state of the resulting assembly. Consequently, cellular bodies that form through liquid-liquid phase separation are a subset of biomolecular condensates, as are those where the physical origins of assembly are unknown. Historically, many cellular non-membrane bound compartments identified microscopically fall under the broad umbrella of biomolecular condensates.
In physics, phase separation can be classified into the following types of colloid, of which biomolecular condensates are one example:
In biology, the most relevant forms of phase separation are either liquid-liquid or liquid-solid, although there have been reports of gas vesicles surrounded by a phase separated protein coat in the cytoplasm of some microorganisms.
Wnt signalling.
One of the first discovered examples of a highly dynamic intracellular liquid biomolecular condensate with a clear physiological function were the supramolecular complexes (Wnt signalosomes) formed by components of the Wnt signaling pathway. The Dishevelled (Dsh or Dvl) protein undergoes clustering in the cytoplasm via its DIX domain, which mediates protein clustering (polymerisation) and phase separation, and is important for signal transduction. The Dsh protein functions both in planar polarity and Wnt signalling, where it recruits another supramolecular complex (the Axin complex) to Wnt receptors at the plasma membrane. The formation of these Dishevelled and Axin containing droplets is conserved across metazoans, including in "Drosophila", "Xenopus", and human cells.
P granules.
Another example of liquid droplets in cells are the germline P granules in "Caenorhabditis elegans". These granules separate out from the cytoplasm and form droplets, as oil does from water. Both the granules and the surrounding cytoplasm are liquid in the sense that they flow in response to forces, and two of the granules can coalesce when they come in contact. When (some of) the molecules in the granules are studied (via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching), they are found to rapidly turnover in the droplets, meaning that molecules diffuse into and out of the granules, just as expected in a liquid droplet. The droplets can also grow to be many molecules across (micrometres) Studies of droplets of the "Caenorhabditis elegans" protein LAF-1 "in vitro" also show liquid-like behaviour, with an apparent viscosity formula_1Pa s. This is about a ten thousand times that of water at room temperature, but it is small enough to enable the LAF-1 droplets to flow like a liquid. Generally, interaction strength (affinity) and valence (number of binding sites) of the phase separating biomolecules influence their condensates viscosity, as well as their overall tendency to phase separate.
Liquid-liquid phase separation in human disease.
Growing evidence suggests that anomalies in biomolecular condensates formation can lead to a number of human pathologies such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

Chickering is a place in the civil parish of Hoxne, and the Mid Suffolk district of Suffolk, England. It is on the B118 Hoxne to Stradbroke road, and approximately north from the county town of Ipswich.
Chickering is listed in the "Domesday Book" (1086) as 'Ciccheli (n) ga'/'Cikelinga'/'Citiringa'. The entry shows Chickering in the Bishop's Hundred of Suffolk, with 13 households, 4 freemen, 0.5 men's plough teams, a meadow of , and 20 pigs, with a tax revenue of 1.8 geld units. The freemen in 1066 were the lords of the manor, with their overlord being Edric of Laxfield. In 1086, after the Conquest, lordship was given to Walter son of Grip, under Robert Malet who was Tenant-in-chief to William the Conqueror.
At Chickering is the seventeenth-century 'Chickering Hall' and farm; the hall is a Grade II listed building within Wingfield parish, with its farm partly extending into Hoxne. The water features at Chickering Hall have largely been filled in. In 1900 Chickering Hall and its farm, one of two farms, was trade directory listed in the parish of Hoxne. No other Chickering trades or occupations were listed at the time in Hoxne or Wingfield.

Hadhramaut Tribal Alliance

The Hadhramaut Tribal Alliance, also known as the Tribal Alliance of Hadramout or the Hadhramaut Tribes Alliance, is an armed group involved in the ongoing Yemeni Civil War. The Alliance's forces are primarily drawn from the Hadhrami people in southern Yemen. During the civil war, the Alliance is often cited as supporting the government of Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and is noted for operating alongside the Republic of Yemen Armed Forces in Hadhramaut.
Operations.
The Hadhramaut Tribal Alliance was formed in the Hadhramaut region of Southern Yemen, where it actively sought to gain more autonomy from the Yemeni Government. In 2014 Alliance actively fought against militants aligned with Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), though it also issued statements in opposition to the Yemeni Government following a series of terrorist attacks in Say'un, and members of the Alliance voiced doubts as to the effectiveness of the government's anti-terrorist campaigns. Following the outbreak of the Yemeni Civil War in 2015, civil infighting created a power vacuum in Southern Yemen. The lack of an organized government presence in the reason allowed for militant groups, most notably AQAP, to take control of parts of the region. In response, the Tribal Alliance and a number of other militia groups formed a centralized military command to coordinate the defense of the lands under their control. In April 2015 forces from these tribes retook land around the cities of Mukalla and Shihr from AQAP and Ansar al-Sharia militants, whom had themselves captured Mukalla on 2 April. The Alliance participated in the Second Battle of Mukalla alongside Yemeni and UAE soldiers one year later in April 2016, and successfully drove AQAP and its affiliates out of Hadhramaut.
As of 2018, the Hadhramaut Tribal Alliance remains aligned with the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and with the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.

Patrick MacMullan

Bishop Patrick MacMullan (17 Mar 1752 – 25 Oct 1824) was an Irish Roman Catholic Prelate and 20th Bishop of Down and Connor.
He was a native of mid Down and details of his early life in the latter half of the eighteenth century are sketchy. It is believed he was ordained to the priesthood in 1775.
He received episcopal consecration on 2nd Sept. 1793, and the following year succeeded his distant cousin Hugh as Bishop of Down and Connor.
In 1814 he made a report to Rome on the state of his diocese (served by around 35 parish priests and a few curates) which although vague gives some indication of the state of the diocese.
He died on 25th Oct 1824 in the house of his nephew in Loughinisland and is buried at Loughinisland Graveyard.
A notice of his death, circulated in many Irish newspapers noted that " the Catholic Clergy of that diocese [Down and Connor] have been under the scriptural jurisdiction of this amiable Prelate for 31 years, during which he has presided over them with the politeness of a Gentleman, the abilities of a Theologian, and the meekness of a humble and exemplary Christian."

Springtime for Hitler (song)

"Springtime for Hitler" is a song written and composed by Mel Brooks for his 1968 film "The Producers".
In the film, the 2001 musical, and 2005 film adaptation the song is part of the stage musical titled "Springtime for Hitler", which the two protagonists produce on Broadway. It was orchestrated by Philip J. Lang and staged by Alan Johnson for the former, with the latter productions orchestrated by Doug Besterman and staged by director Susan Stroman.
Composition and lyrics.
In the film, it has four sections. It begins with a 4/4 interlude sung by actors dressed as Bavarian villagers who have found "a new leader to restore Germany's former glory."
For the main melody, the curtain opens to reveal chorus girls dressed in Ziegfeld-esque costumes laden with German and Nazi iconography and a male Nazi soloist singing:
Springtime for Hitler and Germany
Deutschland is happy and gay
We're marching to a faster pace
Look out! Here comes the master race
Springtime for Hitler and Germany
Rhineland's a fine land once more
Springtime for Hitler and Germany
Watch out, Europe, we're going on tour
Springtime for Hitler and Germany
Winter for Poland and France
Springtime for Hitler and Germany
Come on Germans, go into your dance.
The next section is a tap-dance break with two solo lines in between; "I was born in Dusseldorf and that is why they call me Rolf", "Don't be stupid, be a smarty! Come and join the Nazi Party!"
The latter line was dubbed by Mel Brooks in all versions of the song.
The final section has the entire company reprising the main melody in slow 3/4 march tempo.
Moreover, the verses are accompanied by a "happy chorus line".
Comparison between 1968 film, musical, and 2005 film.
In the 1968 film, stage musical, and 2005 film, the Bavarian interlude, Ziegfeld menagerie, and Busby Berkeley-styled swastika formation remain largely unchanged.
The first major difference between the 1968 film and the stage musical and 2005 film concerned the character who played the part of Adolf Hitler and the circumstances of Springtime for Hitler's surprise success. In the 1968, by the time the song was over, the audience was ready to leave the theatre in disgust and horror, with Max and Leo, ecstatic their plan worked, retreating to a bar. But as the scene changes to reveal hippie actor Lorenzo St. Dubois aka 'L.S.D.'s (played by Dick Shawn) as Adolf Hitler, his wild improvisations prove to be an instant hit, leaving them in hysterical fits of laughter.
In the musical and 2005 film, the character L.S.D. was omitted and the plot was changed to have the character Roger De Bris, the show's director, play Adolf Hitler after the original actor, the playwright Franz Liebkind, "broke (his) leg". The character Ulla is now the part of the cast as Eva Braun and a Black Eagle, and Roger appears immediately after the dance break. He then sings a new section called "Heil Myself", followed by a reprise of the Bavarian interlude done in the style of Judy Garland. Most productions would follow this with a monologue of Hitler's rise to power. In others, it is followed by a satirical "Challenge Tap" dance with the Allied Leaders.
In the musical, Springtime for Hitler is directly presented to the musical audience, with the positive reception confirmed in the following scene in Max and Leo's office. In the 2005 film, the audience is shown preparing to leave in disgust (similar to the 1968 film), but returns to their seats laughing after Roger's flamboyant Hitler appears.

Global Feminisms Project

The Global Feminisms Project, originated in 2002 and based at the Institute for Research on Women and Gender (IRWG) at the University of Michigan, is an oral history project led by a team of researchers at the University of Michigan that collects interviews of feminist activists representing seven countries including China, India, Poland, the United States, Brazil, Nicaragua, and Russia. The focus of the project is to record and archive the stories of females who are activists and scholars within the socio-historical context of their own countries, formed with curricular and research goals at its core. The sources provided lend themselves to comparative and interdisciplinary work, addressing issues that reach across disciplines and provide information regarding activism, historical context, identity formation, and social movements. The interviews are designed to explore the ways in which different forms of activism intersect at various, distinct time points within the history of the represented countries.
The project began with the integration of women's studies, an international perspective, and a focus on the activism within nations. The project emphasizes the relationship between women's activism and feminist scholarship and aims to represent transformations in feminism within each nation represented alongside the following parameters: conceptual, organizational, and social.
Methodology.
The interviewees were selected by each country site's team according to criteria they developed, which often emphasized including individuals who differ by generation, geography, and type of activism, among other things. In the interviews, the women were prompted to discuss their families and upbringing, educational and professional experiences, and activism and involvement in social movements; thus, the University of Michigan program leaders did not control the narrative created of feminism in each country. The interviews took place in the interviewees' home country using their native language, later translated into English.
Some notable interviewees include Ai Xiaoming, Flavia Agnes, Neera Desai, Dora María Téllez, Sofia Montenegro, Grace Lee Boggs, and Holly Hughes.
For a full list of interviewees from the Global Feminisms Project, see list below.
Significance.
The GFP created a collection of oral histories detailing the origins of feminist activists in several countries. The interviews have served as narrative examples of the feminist adage, "the political is personal." They also expand the understanding of the intersections of gender, nationality, race, and women's studies, political climates, and personal experiences.
The project has produced numerous resources that are publicly available including bibliographies, teaching modules, and the archive of video interviews. Additionally, the transcripts of all USA, Poland, Nicaragua, China, and India interviews in English have been entered into NVivo, a qualitative data analysis software, for individuals interested in using the interviews for research purposes.
Funding.
The GFP is partially funded by the following grants and research initiatives:

Valentin Popa

Valentin Popa is a Romanian engineer, university professor, and politician. On 17 February 2012, he was elected rector of the Ștefan cel Mare University of Suceava (USV). He was also minister of education of Romania from 30 January to 27 September 2018.
Academic career.
Popa obtained a degree in electronic and telecommunications engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Iași, the current Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iași (TUIASI), in 1989. He started his academic career as a teaching assistant in a college of this university in Suceava, which would one year later become the current Ștefan cel Mare University of Suceava (USV). He obtained a PhD from the same Polytechnic Institute of Iași in 1998, and rose through all the academic ranks in Suceava until he became full professor in 2005, and was habilitated to supervise doctoral research in 2009. On 17 February 2012 he was elected rector of the Ștefan cel Mare University of Suceava (USV).
International profile.
During his mandate as rector, Popa raised the international profile of Ștefan cel Mare University of Suceava (USV). On 7 July 2015, the President of Moldova, Nicolae Timofti, was awarded an honorary doctorate by this university, in the presence of the President of Romania, Klaus Iohannis. Popa was also the one who proposed Russian ambassador Valeri Kuzmin at a seminar in Suceava to strengthen scientific co-operation in order to improve tank braking systems. The polemic Moscow diplomat in Bucharest had declared that Russia had not intervened in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbass, as proved by the fact that, when they really did intervene in Abkhazia, their tanks did not stop until they were close to the Georgian capital Tbilisi. In 2015 he sponsored the creation of the first master's degree entirely taught in English at the University of Suceava, which was also the subject of a double-degree agreement with a Spanish university.
Political activity.
The nominalization of Popa as minister of national education faced the initial opposition of an influential faction of the Social Democratic Party (PSD). They backed the powerful Ecaterina Andronescu, who had been active in national politics since 1996, including three times as minister of national education. Commentators of this internal conflict, that was very apparent in the Executive Committee of the party, already foresaw that the "hunt" of the new appointee, as they defined it, would continue in the media. But Popa's nomination resisted the pressures, as he had the backing not only of his party in Suceava, but also of 45 out of 48 Romanian rectors and, most importantly, the national leader of the party, Liviu Dragnea. On 27 September 2018 he announced his resignation as minister of national education, as a result of a dispute with the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR), a confidence and supply partner of the coalition government he was part of, over whether Romanian language courses for Hungarian minority pupils should be taught by native Romanian speakers.

Roger MacLean

Roger MacLean (born July 4, ?) is an American police officer and politician who is the President of the Allentown, Pennsylvania City Council. He also served as the acting Mayor of Allentown until March 29, 2018, when he was succeeded in the office by Ray O'Connell. MacLean became the acting mayor on Friday, March 9, 2018, with the resignation of Mayor Ed Pawlowski, who was convicted by jury on March 1, 2018, on 47 felony charges related to a pay-to-play scheme involving his asking for campaign donations in exchange for city contracts and favors.
From 2006 to 2013, MacLean served as the Chief of Police of the Allentown Police Department. His entry into elective politics began in 2015 when he was elected to Allentown's City Council, winning that seat over the incumbent Joe Davis.
Biography.
Personal life and education.
MacLean graduated from William Allen High School and he earned a Master's Degree in criminal justice from DeSales University in Center Valley, Pennsylvania.
Father to six children, Alyssa MacLean is the youngest.
A lifelong resident of Allentown, MacLean resides in the city's West End neighborhood.
Allentown Police Department.
From 1972 until 2013, Roger MacLean served as a police officer with the Allentown Police Department, including his final eight years as Chief of Police. He graduated from both the FBI National Academy and the FBI Law Enforcement Executive Development Seminar.
MacLean joined the Allentown Police Department in 1972 as a cadet. In 1974, he was promoted to a commissioned officer and served within the department's tactical squad, 1st Platoon, and the mounted patrol.
In 1982, Allentown Police Chief Carson S. Gable demoted MacLean and three other police officers following accusations by the Mayor Joseph Daddona that the quartet were part of a group of supporters of the previous police chief, Arthur Allender. The four were also accused by the mayor of bullying behavior, which damaged department morale and operated outside of the command. MacLean and his colleagues filed a lawsuit against the city in response, denying the allegation against them and accusing the Daddona administration of demoting them because they had not supported the mayor during his election campaign. MacLean and the other officers eventually won their lawsuit and were each awarded $125,000 in damages in 1988.
MacLean was further promoted to the positions of detective sergeant in 1984 and patrol lieutenant in 1990. He commanded the 2nd and 3rd Platoons until his 1997 reassignment as supervisor of the investigation division's B Team.
In 1994, MacLean joined with 18 other Allentown police captains and lieutenants in lawsuit against the city. The 19 plaintiffs charged that the city government had denied them pay raises that would have equaled the senior members of the police union, the Fraternal Order of Police. The officers, including MacLean, won the lawsuit in 1996.
In 1997, MacLean and two other police officers filed another suit against the city. The trio charged that then-Mayor William Heydt had denied them promotions within the police department because they had won the previous 1994 lawsuit. The city reached a legal settlement with MacLean and two other officers. As part of the settlement, MacLean $20,000 and six-months free rent at a property owned by the city of Allentown.
MacLean rose to become second in command of the Allentown Police Department's Emergency Response Team. He also taught courses at the Allentown Police Academy.
In 2001, Allentown Mayor William Heydt, who was near the end of his second term, appointed MacLean as the city's acting police chief. Heydt's successor, Mayor Roy Afflerbach, who took office in January 2002, replaced MacLean with a permanent police chief, Stephen L. Kuhn.
MacLean served as patrol captain from 2002 until his appointment as Chief of the Allentown Police Department by Mayor Ed Pawlowski in 2006. From 1972 to 2006, MacLean received six departmental commendations, including three for bravery and heroism.
In January 2006, new Mayor Ed Pawlowski, who had been elected in 2005, appointed Roger MacLean as the new Police Chief of Allentown, replacing outgoing Chief Joseph Blackburn. MacLean was a 31-year veteran of the police force at the time. Pawlowski announced MacLean's appointment on January 6, 2006, just three days after taking office. Two other officers, David Howells Jr. and Joseph Hanna, were appointed assistant police chiefs by the mayor.
Roger MacLean retired as Police Chief of Allentown on September 6, 2013, after four decades with the police force. Assistant Police Chief Joseph Hanna was named interim Police Chief until a permanent replacement for MacLean could be appointed.
On September 16, 2013, just days after his retirement from the Allentown Police Department, MacLean began a new job as the chief investigator of the Lehigh County Regional Intelligence and Investigation Center (RIIC).
Political career.
In 2014, MacLean switched his party affiliation from Republican to Democratic just before applying for a vacancy on the Allentown City Council. However, another candidate was selected to fill the vacant city council seat instead of MacLean. One year later, MacLean was elected to the Allentown City Council by defeating incumbent councilman Joe Davis in the 2015 election.
In 2016, MacLean voted a against a budget resolution, saying it increased Allentown's existing budget deficit. He was also one of just two council members who opposed a new city stormwater fee. Following the 2017 indictment of Mayor Ed Pawlowski on 54 pay-to-play charges, MacLean broke with his city council colleagues to oppose a resolution which urged federal investigator to speed up their investigation of Pawlowski. MacLean also voted against a proposal to hire an attorney to consult on potentially removing Mayor Pawlowski from office. Though he voted against these proposals, MacLean and Pawlowski had a strained relationship dating back to his tenure as police chief.
On January 2, 2018, MacLean was unanimously elected President of the Allentown City Council by its members. The leadership role on the city council meant that MacLean would become acting mayor in the event that Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski resigned or was removed from office. MacLean's election as city council president came just weeks before Mayor Pawlowski was scheduled to go on trial, starting January 16, 2018, on 54 pay-to-play charges.
On March 1, 2018, Mayor Ed Pawlowski was convicted on 47 of the 54 charges related to pay-to-play scheme he operated from office. Pawloski's convictions, all felonies, included conspiracy, as well as multiple counts of bribery, attempted extortion, making false statements to federal officials, honest services fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud. Pawloski resigned from office on Thursday, March 9, 2018. In accordance with the city's home charter rule, city council president Roger MacLean became acting Mayor of Allentown on March 9 upon Pawlowski's resignation. MacLean served as acting mayor until March 29, 2018, when Pawlowski's permanent successor, Ray O'Connell, was chosen. O'Connell will serve until the 2019 mayoral election.

Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources

The Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR) is a university outside Lilongwe, Malawi. It was formed in 2011 by a merger between Bunda College of Agriculture of the University of Malawi and Natural Resources College (NRC)".
History.
In a landmark address to the Malawi parliament on 24th May 2010, the third State President of the Republic of Malawi, His Excellency the late Professor Bingu wa Mutharika shared his vision of establishing six universities in Malawi.
This was meant to address the problems of limited University access and to increase the pool of well-trained human resource in the country in order to accelerate the socio-economic development of Malawi. One of the new universities to be established was the Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR) which was to be formed by transforming the then Bunda College of Agriculture into a University with the integration of Natural Resources College (NRC).
LUANAR was therefore created through an Act of Parliament No. 22 of 2011 and started her operations on 1st July 2012, with Bunda Campus, as the initial institution until NRC was fully integrated into LUANAR in December 2014.
It has four faculties: Faculty of Agriculture (founded in 1967), Faculty of Natural Resources (2001), Faculty of Development Studies (2004), and Faculty of Food and Human Sciences (2013). Ph.D. programmes are operated in collaboration with the Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM).
Bunda Farm, which was part of Bunda College and an economic negative for the college, became a limited company in 2005. In 2017, Bunda Farm Ltd. started a service station with fuel pumps at the campus in order to generate income to the university as well as to train students in business management.

The department aims to advance and promote knowledge and practical skills in agricultural and applied economics through training, research, consultancies and outreach with the aim of contributing to poverty reduction by promoting efficiency in agricultural production and increased incomes for the majority of farmers in Malawi. The department envisions of becoming a centre of excellence in training, research, outreach and consultancy in Agricultural and Applied Economics within Malawi and beyond. The department also offers courses in the Collaborative MSc Programme in Agricultural and Applied Economics, a regional programme which aims to equip professionals with knowledge and skills essential for transforming the currently underdeveloped agro-food sectors and rural economies of Eastern, Central and Southern Africa to perform well in an environmentally sustainable fashion. 
Extension Department.
The vision of the Department is to become a Centre of excellence in training, research outreach and consultancy in agricultural extension and rural development within Malawi and the region. Its mission is to advance and promote knowledge and practical skills in extension and rural development through teaching, research, outreach and consultancies with the aim of promoting agricultural production, rural incomes and ultimately livelihoods improvement for the majority of small holder farmers in Malawi and the region.
Faculty Of Veterinary Medicine.
The Faculty of veterinary medicine at LUANAR was established in 2013 and began its professional education program in 2014. The Faculty graduated its first batch 12 veterinary doctors in 2019. Veterinary research is conducted in the faculty and has international collaborations with University of Edinburgh, Valencia, Hokkaido, Cornel, and ILRI. The faculty emphasizes research of infectious diseases, Research is also conducted on immunity and nutrition, cardiovascular diseases, reproductive diseases, and diseases of terrestrial and aquatic wildlife. Public Service. The service programs focus on the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and control and prevention of animal diseases. The faculty assists veterinary practitioners, animal owners, and the general public through partnership with government and NGOs.
Faculty of Food and Human Sciences.
The Faculty of Food and Human Sciences was established following the instituting of Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR) through an Act of Parliament No. 22 of 2011. LUANAR emanated from Bunda College of Agriculture, then a constituent college of University of Malawi (UNIMA), which was de-linked from UNIMA on 1st July 2012. The Faculty of Food and Human Sciences (FFHS) stemmed from the then Department of Home Economics and Human Nutrition (DHEHN) which was established in 1984. From 1984 to 2013, the DHEHN grew in terms of staffing (4 to 22), student enrolment (3 to 331), academic programmes (0- 4), teaching and research facilities, financial and material resources, outreach programmes, publications, and in its relevance to national, regional and international development goals. The FFHS became operational in July 2013, consisting of the office of the dean, departments of Food Science and Technology, Human Nutrition and Health, and Human Ecology
Human Nutrition and Health Department.
Just as health citizens are key to national development; adequate nutrition is a key determinant of sound health. The absence of adequate nutrition in all its forms amounts to an intolerable burden that suffocates fulfillment of life goals, enjoyment of life, and the very essence of human survival.
Human Ecology Department.
Families and resources are very important to the development of a nation. In order to achieve Millennium Development Goals, the effort has to start at family level. Human ecology helps in understanding the relationships between humans, resources and nature, all intimately connected in a web of interactions. The newly established department of Human Ecology at LUANAR has positioned itself to be a key partner in providing academic leadership in human sciences and community services at local and global levels. 
Food Science and Technology Department.
Food processing and value addition are key elements in the Malawi Governments strategy to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger. The newly established Department of Food Science and Technology at LUANAR has positioned itself to be a key partner in proving academic leadership in food science and technology as well as generating knowledge on the qualities of Malawian raw materials, and how they can be safely processed into high value and good quality food products to meet the demands of Malawian and international markets.
Faculty of Natural Resources.
The faculty of Natural Resources established in July 2001, consists of three departments as follows; i.e Department of Aquaculture and Fisheries Science, Department of Forestry and Department of Environmental Science and Management.
The Department of Forestry.
The Department of Forestry was initially part of the Department of Horticulture and Forestry. The vision of the Department of Forestry is to be LUANAR's center of excellence in training, research, extension and consultancies in forestry within Malawi and globally. It is one of the departments in the Faculty of Natural Resources.
The Department of Aquaculture and Fisheries Science.
Aquaculture and Fisheries Science Department (AQFD) at Bunda College originated from a single course Aquaculture and Wildlife Management offered in the Department of Animal Science from 1974 to 1993. Due to demand for capacity building in Aquaculture from SADC region, a draft Aquaculture curriculum was produced in 1991 and Aquaculture courses were to be offered as an option in the Animal Science Department. The first optional courses were offered in 1994/95-academic year. Students from other countries in SADC started joining the college in the same year for Diploma and Degree programs in Agriculture with bias in aquaculture. Some regional students studying in the Animal Science Masters program had opted to do research in aquaculture. 
The Department of Environment and Natural Resource Management.
The Department of Environmental Science and Management (DESM) was established in 2001 and it belongs to the Faculty of Natural Resources. The department has a complement of fourteen academic staff positions. The areas of specialization for the staff members include Environmental Management, Wild-life Ecology, Environment and Development, Environmental Science, Environmental and Natural Resource Economics, and Genetic Resource Conservation. There are three positions for technicians in the department to be filled.
Faculty of Postgraduate Studies.
This offers programmes at the postgraduate diploma, masters and doctoral levels
AquaFish.
AquaFish is one of two Africa Centres of Excellence based in Malawi (the other, ACEPHEM, is based at the University of Malawi College of Medicine).
Controversies.
In December 2017, student protests over frequent power outages at the Bunda campus ended in property damages and an arrest of 46 students. The campus was closed for some time. The Malawi Human Rights Commission that investigated the death of a student found that some students had been subject to torture or inhumane treatment by the police, but did not find the police responsible for the student's death.

Litchfield Opera House

The Litchfield Opera House is a community building in Litchfield, Minnesota, United States, listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its significance to the community. A committee of businessmen organized in 1899 with the intention of providing a place to hold meetings and theatrical performances. The previous town hall, built in 1871, was obsolete. The government of Litchfield Township, Minnesota paid for construction of the building, which was designed by architect W.T. Towner and built by N.P. Franzen. The city bought the building from the township in 1911. The opera house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
The building is a well-preserved example of Renaissance Revival architecture, which is otherwise rare in Litchfield and Meeker County. Most of the facade is yellow clay brick, manufactured locally, and accented with red brick and red terra cotta patterns. The opera house opened on November 8, 1900, with the play "The Marble Heart" starring William Owen. Besides operas and performances, the auditorium housed town meetings, elections, military recruitment, and other government functions. Somewhere between 1930 and 1939, the interior was remodeled for use as city offices. In 1983, when the building was nominated to the National Register, it housed civic offices and organizations, and it was used as a meeting place for senior citizens, the Girl Scouts, and community education. Public officials and the Litchfield Police Department also used some of the rooms. In 2002, the city removed its offices from the building and moved its offices to trailers in the parking lot. This move was made because mold was found in the building. The city completed its new city hall in 2006, but the fate of the building had not been decided yet. In 2008, the city sold the building to the Greater Litchfield Opera House Association, Inc. for $100,000. The city accepted a 1900 silver dollar for payment and specified that the balance of the purchase price would be invested in the building to renovate it for the community.
The building is available for rental for parties, weddings, dinners, funeral, bar mitzvahs, and other personal events.

Suffolk (1795 ship)

Suffolk was launched in 1795 at Newcastle. In 1800 she made one voyage for the British East India Company (EIC). She traded widely as different owners deployed her on one route or another.
Captain John Luke acquired a letter of marque on 22 November 1800. Messrs. Princep and Saunders had tendered "Suffolk", John Luke, master, to the EIC to bring back rice from Bengal. She was one of 28 vessels that sailed on that mission between December 1800 and February 1801. 
"Suffolk" sailed on 25 December 1800 and returned on 28 February 1802.
"Lloyd's List" reported on 25 February 1825 that "Suffolk", Allison, master, had been blown out of Madeira on 25 January and that she had not returned by the 28th.
Following the resumption of war with France in early 1803, concern developed in Britain about Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom. The British government's response took many forms including the reactivation of Fencible regiments and the Sea Fencibles, a program of the construction of Martello Towers along the coasts of Britain and Ireland, and the commissioning of a number of armed defense ships. 
The British East India Company in November voted to underwrite 10,000 tons (bm) of armed transports to protect Great Britain's coasts. The vessels were existing, but not EIC, merchantmen that would receive an upgrade in armament and in some cases a naval officer as captain. The vessels were: "Albion", , , "Aurora", , , , "Helder", , , "Lord Nelson", , , , , "Sir Alexander Mitchell", "Suffolk", and "Triton".
On 21 November 1803 "Suffolk", of 362 tons (bm) and 16 guns, was ready but yet to be allocated to her station. The Royal Navy returned the armed defense ships to their owners by the second half of 1805.
In 1836 new owners, Richard Wilson and George Foggo, shifted her registry to Whitby. She was broken up in December 1844.
Note.
Because "Suffolk" and both sailed to Bengal at the same time to bring back rice, and was launched in Bengal, the three vessels are sometimes conflated.

Online child abuse

Online child abuse is a unique form of child abuse also known as “Cyber Molestation” due to its virtual, distanced, and anonymous nature. Such abuse may not happen face-to-face, nor does it necessarily require physical contact. However, online abuse can result in negative face-to-face consequences in the form of statutory rape, forcible sexual assault, harassment, etc. In the United States, online child abuse is recognized as a form of child abuse by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
Online abuse of children can occur through a variety of forms including, but not limited to cyber-bullying, grooming, and sexual abuse. Such abuse requires the use of the World Wide Web or cellphones, increasing its significance in an increasingly technological world. The perpetrator of such online abuse may be a stranger or someone who is previously known by the victim.
A report by the Data &amp; Society Research Institute and the Center for Innovative Public Health Research showed that 72% of U.S. Internet users have witnessed some form of online harassment or abuse, while 47% have personally experienced it. This study found no distinction between genders with respect to harassment, but deduced that women were at risk for a wider variety of online abuse.
Governments across the world have acknowledged the importance of recognizing and combating online abuse of children. In the United States this effort is led by the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. This task force consists of 61 individual task forces engaging with 4,500 federal, state, and local law-enforcement agencies all with the goal of combating online abuse of children.
Cyber-bullying.
Cyber-bullying, or Internet bullying, occurs when an individual or group electronically distributes negative, false, or otherwise harmful content about an individual or group using personal or private information that causes humiliation or distress to that individual. Cyber-bullying can happen through the use of any device that is able to connect to the Internet (desktop, mobile devices, gaming devices, etc.) of cellphones and does not require the perpetrator to be in the same vicinity of the victim.
Cyber-bullying is especially prevalent among children as an extension of bullying within schools. A Canadian research study found that children who were victims of cyber-bullying and also bullied in school were more likely to bully others over cyberspace.
Prevalence.
Studies show a rising trend in online bullying. Although it remains the least-reported form of bullying it is relatively hidden and believed to be under-reported. Because victims often cannot evade cyber-bullies, they may harbor feelings of guilt, incompetence or despair. Upwards of 37% of victims of cyber-bullying do not report their abuse. According to statistics of cyber-bullying from the i-SAFE Foundation, more than 50% of adolescents have been the victims of cyber-bullying, where one-third of them have been threatened online. A roughly equal number admit to having engaged in perpetrating cyber-bullying themselves. Of the victims that reported their abuse, 25% reported repeated cyber-bullying. The "Harford County Examiner" reported that far more than 50% of child victims hid the issue from their parents when it occurred. The same examination reported that 1 in 10 youths had damaging photos taken of themselves without their permission, and that girls are more likely to be involved with cyber-bullying than boys, both as bullies and as victims. Different social groups and ages tend to receive differing amounts of unwanted negative feedback. For example, a reported 55.2% of young LGBTQ community members have been victims of cyber-bullying. Another trend shows that school-aged children are more likely to be victims of online abuse.
Variation.
A study in 2011 found three primary reasons for targeting others over the Internet: informal social control, dominance, and entertainment. Informal social control is applying pressure to change another person's behavior. Dominance refers to the attempt(s) of hurting someone, humiliating someone, or gaining access to their personal information (secrets, explicit photos, etc.). Entertainment refers to what is commonly known as trolling: purposefully humiliating, annoying, or bothering someone for the purpose of eliciting an emotional response for the bully's enjoyment. Perpetrators of trolling are called "trolls", which are a subset of cyberbullies.
Effects.
Cyber-bullying is very common among children and young adults that are ten to eighteen years old. Victims of cyber-bullying, often feel negative about themselves after being bullied. It is also common for cyber-bullying to have negative effects on cyber victims' social well-being because it has a negative impact on their self-esteem. Another consequence of cyber-bullying is that a cyber victim may fear for their own safety. Further research conducted by Patchin &amp; Hinduja (2010) found that those involved with cyber-bullying, as perpetrators, victims, or both, have significantly lower self-esteem than those who have little to no exposure to cyber-bullying. Kowalski &amp; Limber (2013) also found that bullies and victims had the most negative scores on most measures of psychological health, physical, health, and academic performance.
Laws.
United States.
In the United States, parents are encouraged to monitor their children's online activity and deal with cyber-bullying appropriately. If cyber-bullying involves sexual content or sexting, however, the cyberbully and their parents can also be subject to legal consequences, including being registered as sexual offenders. Cyber-bullying that does not involve explicit sexual content can be more difficult to prosecute because there are no federal laws directly protecting children from direct forms of cyber-bullying. Cases of cyber-bullying are difficult to pursue in the United States due to infringement on First Amendment rights (i.e.: freedom of speech).
U.S. schools can take action on incidents that occur outside of school if there is either a clear 'disruption to the educational process' or a 'true' threat to one (or more) of the students. For an expression to be considered a 'true' threat, the federal court must determine "whether a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of intent to harm or assault". As cyberbulling is increasingly recognized as a nationwide issue in the United States, whether or not public schools can limit their students' speech outside of school hours is becoming more of an issue.
High-profile cases of cyberbullying have been brought to the attention of state and local legislatures, and most U.S. states have implemented laws that ban any online communication that aims to cause humiliation, emotional distress, or fright. Prosecution of cyber-bullying cases are usually a combination of civil laws that best fit the nature of each individual case. Most states have both anti-bullying laws and policies, save for Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, and Texas. Stopbullying.gov, a federal agency tasked with preventing all forms of bullying, has created a detailed list of state laws and policies. An examples of a state anti-bullying campaign is the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center, which provides curriculum to educators about cyber-bullying and its connection to bullying inside of schools.
Cyber-bullying was specifically targeted in federal law by the Megan Meier Cyber-bullying Prevention Act introduced to the House of Representatives in 2009. This prevention act sought to:
This act was the result of the suicide of Megan Meier in 2006. Megan was the victim of cyber-bullying by a mother and teen daughter, which resulted in Megan committing suicide in her home in Missouri.
Grooming.
Grooming is a phenomenon that can occur on or offline. The official definition of grooming used by the U.S. Department of Justice is: 
The above definition emphasizes the use of the child's family in building trust with the child. When grooming occurs online, however, this is frequently done without the knowledge or compliance of any adult. When children can use the Internet without supervision, there is more room for potential abuse.
Online grooming itself can be driven by a variety of things. Most common is the use of online grooming to build a trusting relationship with a child in order to engage in either online or in-person sexual acts. The Internet is used to lead a child to potential sexual behavior. Grooming can also be used for other forms of exploitation of the child, such as blackmail for monetary gain and more. The two forms may be used in combination, with groomers convincing children to perform these sexual acts, such as the sending of nude photographs, and then blackmailing the victim by threatening to release information about them.
Variation.
Online grooming can occur in a variety of ways. Most commonly, chat rooms or social networks are used to make initial contact with possible victims. Groomers may also use photo-sharing apps, dating apps, or gaming websites to find their victims. After establishing an online relationship, the groomer turns conversations to more personal matters, frequently sexual topics. Groomers may then engage in sexual conversations with their victims, send nude photos or videos, encourage sexual acts on webcam, or persuade the victim to meet in person for sexual acts.
Groomers are not exclusively strangers. They can be family friends or individuals who have met the child before but primarily use the Internet in order to strengthen that relationship for future exploitation of the child. Individual groomers can be of any sex, gender, or age. Grooming is considered a complicated matter, and groomers may use many tactics. Groomers may use compliments or make promises to the child in order to elicit certain behaviors. Groomers may also assert control over the child to exploit natural sexual curiosity.
Frequently, groomers make a fake profile in order to create a persona more likely to be trusted by their possible victims. Such a phenomenon is known as catfishing. The definition of a catfish is "a person who sets up a false personal profile on a social networking site for fraudulent or deceptive purposes." Although catfishing is not exclusively used by online groomers, it is a common way in which groomers contact their potential victim and build trust through a more-trustworthy false identity. Catfishing itself is not illegal in the United States, unlike identity theft, but when used as a method for online grooming is considered as the crime of grooming.
Prevalence.
Grooming and overall online abuse of children is an issue of growing concern in the modern technological era. Victims of online grooming are frequently young teens, with the majority of victims being between the ages of 13 and 15. In a 2012 literature review of research in the area conducted by various English scholarly institutions, it was found that 9% of Internet users aged 10–17 reported unwanted online sexual solicitation or attempted grooming.
Laws.
United States.
In the United States, grooming is considered a federal offense. Several federal laws include sections involving grooming. Under section § 2422 of the United States Criminal Code:
The U.S. Bar Association claims that this statute "targets the sexual grooming of minors as well as the actual sexual exploitation of them."
Because of grooming's complex nature and the relationship of trust between the groomer and the victim, grooming in and of itself is infrequently left unrecognized. Only when the grooming results in sexual acts between an adult and a minor, the exchange of sexual images, or the extortion of money does it come to the eyes of a court. In the case of Shelly Chartier, the online grooming and resulting crimes were met with jail time. Chartier, through the use of catfishing both NBA star Chris Andersen and aspiring model Paris Dunn, groomed 17-year-old Dunn into exchanging nude photos and sexual acts under the false identity of Andersen. She then sent such images to Andersen who was under the impression that he was both receiving these from Dunn herself and that Dunn was not underage. Chartier then extorted money from Andersen, claiming she would reveal his possession of child pornography unless he paid her. Chartier was eventually caught and faced 18 months in prison for various crimes, including, but not limited to, extortion, impersonation, and making threats. State legislatures, such as Illinois, have introduced language that specifically includes electronic or web-based methods of grooming into their laws.
Non-governmental advocacy.
In addition to legislation, there are several non-governmental programs and initiatives aimed at the issue. For example, R.AGE, a Malaysian-based group of journalists, aims to spread information about many important issues, including online safety and the occurrence of online grooming, in the hopes of "telling stories that matter, that make a difference, that hold people accountable, that give a voice to those who don't have one."
In addition, Pandora's Protect is a nonprofit organization that aims to provide support to the victims of crimes such as online grooming and assault. In addition, they spread information in order to prevent further assaults.
Sexual abuse.
Online sexual abuse is a relatively modern trend, in which perpetrators utilize modern forms of technology such as live stream web cameras, cell phones, or social media to coerce targeted victims into inappropriate and sometimes illegal sex acts. Abusers do not discriminate and target victims of every walk of life. Online sexual abuse differs from other forms of sexual abuse in that it can be perpetrated stealthily on a global scale, allowing the offender to evade capture. At the same time, technology offers predators greater opportunities to find the youth that they prey upon. Children are often the targets of online sexual predators who will often bully, emotionally manipulate, blackmail, or befriend willing communicators on the web in order to obtain their desires. Online sexual abuse may vary from personal interactions between a victim and offender to a more mechanized process, in which children are sexually exploited for the perpetrators' profit. Online sexual predators often target young victims, with a study showing that 13% of children receive negative unwanted attention of a sexual nature on the Internet. Predators make contact with prospective targets in a variety of settings, although the most prolific place that predators troll is chat rooms, where 76% of known first encounters with online sexual predators occur. Predators troll chat rooms and other forms of social media like MySpace or Facebook, seeking people who outwardly share personal information.
Detection and deterrence of online sexual abuse are difficult because of the anonymous nature of the Internet; however, stopping and detecting an online predator's criminal activity is the task of various government organizations like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI's Violent Crimes Against Children Program was specifically created, "...to provide a rapid, proactive, and comprehensive counter to all threats of abuse and exploitation of children" in its jurisdiction. The FBI accomplishes quick response times by having agents scouring the Internet in search of perpetrators; they ask for information in forums and chat-rooms and look for the telltale signs of abusive behavior in the children they interact with. Online sexual predators, however, are often difficult to distinguish because they show a misleading representation of themselves to avoid incriminating evidence. Rather than relying completely on authorities to apprehend the perpetrators of online sexual abuse, one may decrease the chances of unwanted and unsolicited advances from online predators by keeping one's intimately private details off of the Internet. Another way to avoid unwanted sexual solicitations is to ignore, block, and report an offender to the website's management staff.
Laws.
United States.
A variety of laws are in place to deter online criminal activity pertaining to sexual abuse. The "Federal Criminal Code and Rules" outlines a variety of rules and regulations regarding sexual abuse under Title 18 of the United States Code. Section 1462 titled "Importation or transportation of obscene matters", outlines what would be considered transporting obscene material over the Internet. Child pornography violates this law, among others, because under this code, "Any obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy book, pamphlet, picture, motion-picture film, paper, letter, writing, print, or other matter of indecent character" may be subject to fine or imprisonment of up to five years.
Online sexual offenders who target children may also fall under the jurisdiction of Section 2243 "Sexual abuse of a minor or ward" or Section 2251 "Sexual exploitation of children" under which they could be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. These sections are outlined as, "...aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abusive sexual contact involving a minor or ward, or sex trafficking of children, or the production, possession, receipt, mailing, sale, distribution, shipment, or transportation of child pornography ... not less than 30 years or for life [or can carry] any term years or for life." As noted, any sexual abuse of children, whether online or in person, is subject to strict punishment by law.
Examples.
Online abuse often manifests itself in physical and psychological harm to victims, as previously stated. In recent history, Larry Nassar, a USA Gymnastics team doctor, was charged with 60 years in federal prison when he pleaded guilty to charges related to receiving child pornography, possessing child pornography, and destroying and concealing evidence relating to child pornography. Prosecutors have stated that a supremely close link between his child pornography activities had directly impacted his repeat, "molestation of children". At the height of his child pornography obsession, Nassar had thousands of pictures of underage children. In the wake of this scandal, affecting hundreds of women of a variety of ages, reforms have been made to further combat future occurrences of this abuse by USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. Also gathering a large following in the wake of this scandal is the Me Too movement.

Florenza Moore Grant

Florenza Moore Grant (December 5, 1921 – July 30, 2001) was one of the first African-Americans to register to vote in Halifax County, North Carolina, in the 1950s. Her family battled against the USDA claiming there was a discriminatory practice against them. Her family also ran a gas station, barbershop, and other businesses. She had joined the NAACP in her younger years and continued to take part in protests up into her early 30s.
Early life, education and family.
Grant was born in Rich Square, North Carolina. She grew up on a farm with her 11 siblings. She graduated high school and got married that year to Matthew Moore Grant who was a ministers son. She and her husband bought a farm in Tillery, North Carolina, and raised 5 children. Grant's husband owned and ran a barber shop while the family ran a gas station. Her son, Gary Moore, after she and her husband died. Moore passed away.
Battle against the USDA.
In Tillery, North Carolina, the USDA or the Farm Security Administration (FSA) was tightly controlled by a group of Euro-American males. African-American farmers were settled in the floodplains next to the Roanoke River while the Euro-American farmers were resident in the hillside where flooding did not occur. Along with higher flood risks, African-Americans received fewer allotments. The Grants had been receiving threats of foreclosure by the FSA because of their race. Gary Grant later sued the USDA for practicing racial discrimination in 1997.
Registering to vote.
Many African-Americans had been trying to get registered to vote in Halifax County, North Carolina. Groups of people would head down to the courthouse, but get sent away. One Saturday Florenza Moore Grant's husband asked her to try to register. Grant went down to the courthouse and was questioned about her education and if she was willing to abide by the rules while a Euro-American woman around the age of 18 walked right into the courthouse and registered without a problem. Grant had to read and write a portion of the Constitution, but she had been practicing reading and writing the constitution. She got to correct the registrar a few times and passed with ease. The registrar was livid with Grant, but he registered her.

Higashiyama Treasure

The Higashiyama Treasure (東山御物 "Higashiyama gyomutsu, Higashiyama gomotsu") was a collection of important and valuable artefacts by the Ashikaga shogunate. It is named after the residence of the 8th "shōgun" of the Ashikaga shogunate, (1436–1490), in the eastern hills (東山 "Higashiyama") of the capital city Kyoto. The items consisted mostly of "karamono" (Chinese items) and consisted of ceramics, lacquerware, paintings, calligraphy, and others. It represented the pinnacle of Higashiyama culture.
After the fall of the shogunate the treasures were dispersed and some survived the times and are listed as either National Treasures or Important Cultural Property.
The collecting of important items was continued by the warlords Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who laid great emphasis on Japanese tea utensils as "chadō" was developed. These were known as special tea utensils (名物 "meibutsu", 大名物 ).

Bay of Colwyn Town Council

Bay of Colwyn Town Council is an elected community council serving the town of Colwyn Bay in North Wales, and neighbouring communities of Rhos-on-Sea and Old Colwyn.
Background.
Bay of Colwyn Town Council was formed in 1996 following the dissolution of Colwyn Borough Council. The Council covers the communities of Colwyn Bay (Glyn and Rhiw electoral wards), Old Colwyn (Colwyn and Eirias wards) and Rhos-on-Sea (Dinarth and Rhos wards). Each ward elects four town councillors, making a total of 24 councillors. The Council elects a Chairman every year in May, the Chairman also holds the post of Town Mayor.
The town council has been involved since 2014 in a battle with the county council to save and restore the Grade II-listed Colwyn Bay pier. Although the town council had pledged £25,000 in 2013 to redevelop the pier (which had been closed since 2008), Conwy County Borough Council voted to de-list and demolish the structure. The town council expressed their anger that they hadn't been consulted about this.
In January 2018 the council made the UK news when Conservative Town Mayor, Jeff Pearson, called for residents to stop recycling their rubbish, in protest at Conwy County Borough Council's plans to reduce the number of refuse collections to 12 per year.

The theatrical premiere of "The Happys" took place on March 16, 2018 in California.
Critical reception.
Responding to festival screenings of "The Happys", critics called the movie "one ironically fun film about what it means to be happy" that "jumps fearlessly into its subject matter." Variety described "The Happys" as a "middling work," "The Hollywood Reporter" wrote that it is a "quirky, insiderish L.A. dramedy," the "Los Angeles Times" said it was "a cutesy classic Hollywood tale adapted for modern times," and "The Advocate" called "The Happys" "charming and thoughtful."

Società Anonima per la Strada Ferrata dell'Italia Centrale

The Società Anonima per la Strada Ferrata dell'Italia Centrale was a railway company established in 1851 for the purpose of creating a railway link between Piacenza, Bologna and Tuscany. It later became part of the Milan - Bologna Railway.
History.
The company was established in Florence by Bartolomeo Cini with the collaboration of the brothers Pietro and Tommaso, in order to obtain the concession, following the Convention stipulated in Rome on 1 May 1851 between the governments of the Papal States, of the Austrian Empire, of the Duchy of Modena, of the Duchy of Parma and of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany for the construction of a railway starting in Piacenza and continuing to Parma, Reggio Emilia and Modena up to Bologna and from there towards Tuscany and Prato or Pistoia. There would be a junction at Reggio Emilia with a branch coming from the Po in the direction of Mantua.
Finance.
A Building and Administration Committee was set up which, once activated, would be replaced by a Management Committee. A fund was established of seventy-five million Italian lire divided into seventy-five thousand bearer shares. Article 5 of the Trust Act established that, in addition to the company's headquarters in Florence, a domicile in Modena would also have to be elected, in which a Plenipotentiary Representative would be established to deal definitively with the International Commission established for the purposes of the Modena project.
The company began issuing shares to raise the necessary capital for which the governments would guarantee a 5% interest. The following years, however, did not give the expected results as regards the raising of capital needed for the works on the Bologna - Pistoia section. In the summer of 1853 the company began the excavation of two shafts for the construction of the Apennine Tunnel and some preliminary works along the way. Financial difficulties slowed the execution of the work.
Reorganization.
In December 1854, the "International Commission" had to meet again to redefine the structure of the "Railway track of Central Italy" that risked not being able to finish the work undertaken. The following year, projects to reorganize the contract were put forward. The Count and banker Pietro Bastogi, who was involved at the request of Bartolomeo Cini himself, offered to contribute to the financing and to take over the commercial management of the company. The "Commission" rejected the solution by presenting other candidates. Under pressure from the Austrian Government, the Duke of Galliera became interested in entering the affair and also Paulin Talabot who was closely connected to the Parisian Rothschild house. On 14 March 1856 a new agreement was signed in Vienna with which the Austrian government transferred its Lombardo - Veneto lines to the private company that had been set up with the participation of the aforementioned subjects.
New company.
On 17 March 1856, the agreement with the Duchies of Parma and Modena, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Papal States was transferred to a new company, the Imperial-regia società privilegiata delle strade ferrate lombardo-venete e dell'Italia Centrale. The company was formed with finance from the Rothschild houses in Vienna, Paris and London and the participation of Italian financiers including Pietro Bastogi and the Dukes Lodovico Melzi and Raffaele de Ferrari. It was licensed to finish the Central Apennine Railway (from Piacenza to Pistoia) and the branch to Reggio Emilia for Borgoforte. On 24 May 1856, the concession already granted (16 June 1851) to the "Società Anonima per la Strada Ferrata dell'Italia Centrale" regarding the Pistoia - Bologna line passed to the new company.

José Triana (poet)

José Triana (4 January 1931 – 4 March 2018) was a Cuban poet and playwright.
Life and career.
Born in Hatuey, Camagüey Province on 4 January 1931, Triana attended the University of Oriente. He moved to Spain in 1954, where he began his career as a playwright. While in Spain, Triana studied at the University of Madrid and theatre with José Franco. Triana later joined the troupe Grupo Didi, and worked as a scenic artist for Teatro Ensayo. Most his early plays were inspired by Greek tragedy. Triana wrote his first play, "The Major General Will Speak of Theogony", in 1957, and began work on his best known play "Night of the Assassins" later that year. After Fidel Castro took power in 1959, Triana returned to Cuba. In 1960, Triana's "Medea in the Mirror" was produced at the Prometeo Theatre.

He married Chantal Chilhaud-Dumaine (daughter of , Ambassador of France to Portugal) in 1968. Triana and his wife were exiled to France in 1980. In France, Triana adapted "Respectable Women", a novel by , into the play "Dialogue for Women", eventually retitled "Common Words", an homage to the play "Divine Words", written by Ramón del Valle-Inclán.

National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service

The National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service was a United States temporary federal agency established by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.
Purpose.
The commission was formed by Congress to:
Scope of Review.
The legislation creating the commission outlined that the commission should consider:
Commissioners.
Appointed members of the Commission were:
Activities.
The Commission requested written comments from the public on a list of questions it was considering, and held a series of hearings and site visits in 2018 including public meetings in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Denver, Colorado. In 2019, the Commission held a series of formal public hearings with panels of invited witnesses. According to documents released in response to a Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) request, the Commission also held closed-door meetings and received closed-door briefings. On 13 November 2019, members of the Commission held a conference call with anti-draft organizations and activists.
Minutes of the commission's deliberations and decisions were released by the National Archives and Records Administration in response to FOIA requests after the Commission was disbanded. In July 2018, the Commission voted 10-0 (one of the 11 members was absent and cast no vote by proxy) to recommend continued contingency planning for a draft. That left open the question of whether to continue, expand, or modify the Selective Service registration program. The Commission decided on most of its recommendations during a series of meetings from July 15–19, 2019, that it described as a "VOTE-O_RAMA". There were 7 Democratic appointments to the Commission (including 4 Congressional appointments and 3 appointments by President Obama) and 4 Republican Congressional appointments. To preclude purely party-line decisions, the Commissioners agreed to require 8 votes for any final recommendation. On 16 July 2019, the Commissioners voted 7-4 in favor of recommending expanding draft registration to women. According to their own self-imposed rules, this left them unable to make a recommendation on this issue. Two days later, after one of the Commissioners in the minority had been persuaded to change their vote, the NCMNPS reconsidered the question and voted 8-3 to recommend expanding draft registration to women.
Reports.
On January 23, 2019, the Commission released an interim report outlining the various options. On March 25, 2020, after holding various public hearings and closed-door, invitation only meetings, the Commission issued its final report, recommending that the requirement for young men to register with the Selective Service System should be retained and should be expanded to young women as well as young men. The report also made various other recommendations with respect to the Selective Service System and voluntary national and public (government) service.

Rocky River Run

The Rocky River Run (currently branded as the 7 Rocky River Run for sponsorship reasons) is a half-marathon fun run held in the Australian city of Rockhampton in either late May or early June each year.
The event also incorporates 10-kilometre, 5-kilometre and 2-kilometre events. The courses are centred around Rockhampton's Fitzroy River and all except the 2-kilometre course traverse the heritage-listed Alexandra Bridge and the Fitzroy Bridge.
The Rocky River Run began when the local Rotary Club created the event in 2007 with just 358 entrants competing but has steadily grown in popularity.
Rotary continued to organise the Rocky River Run until it grew so large it became difficult for the community group to organise and were considering cancelling the event in 2016. However, they reached an agreement with local employment agency Capricorn Training Company to take over the organisation of the event.
In 2017, the Seven Network became the official naming rights sponsor.
The event celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2017.
In recent years, the number of competitors has been fluctuating around 2000 competitors.
The event is held as a way to raise money for charities, namely youth suicide preventative and mental health initiatives such as RUOK? Day.
In 2017, the event raised $15,000 for R U OK? Day initiatives and another $15,000 for Ronald McDonald House Charities.
Originally commencing from Victoria Park in Wandal, the Rocky River Run moved to the newly redeveloped Quay Street riverside precinct in the city in 2017.

Electric Light is the second studio album by British singer-songwriter James Bay. The album was released on 18 May 2018 through Republic Records.
Background.
On 7 March 2018, Bay announced that his second album was called "Electric Light" and would be released on 18 May 2018. In a press release, he said: "If I had to describe my first album visually it would probably be a flame – while this new album is about a real sonic and artistic evolution for me. The feeling of a 100 watt bulb expanding and brightening is what I envisioned. "Electric Light" came to my mind and I knew it was perfect."
Critical reception.
At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 71 based on 13 ratings, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Jordan Bassett of "NME" stated "'Electric Light' is all over the place. There are hip-hop style spoken-word skits on the record and, actually, it sometimes sounds more like a lush, exploratory mixtape than a coherent album." He rated the album 3/5. "Q" magazine was quoted as saying the album contains "an admirable desire for transformation." Stereogum wrote "It’s a genuinely thrilling piece of work, one that converted me into a James Bay fan on impact."

NXT North American Championship

The NXT North American Championship is a professional wrestling championship created and promoted by the American promotion WWE, defended on their SmackDown brand division. It is one of three secondary championships in WWE, along with the United States Championship on Raw and the Intercontinental Championship on SmackDown. The current champion is Isaiah "Swerve" Scott, who is in his first reign.
Introduced during the March 7, 2018 tapings of "NXT" (aired March 28), the title was established as the secondary championship for NXT, which at the time was still regarded as a developmental territory for WWE. The inaugural champion was Adam Cole. Around this time, NXT was in the midst of establishing itself as WWE's third major brand, which became official in September 2019 when NXT was moved to the USA Network.
The title is distinct from the WWF North American Heavyweight Championship, as it does not carry the lineage of the former title, which was contested from 1979–1980.
History.
In June 2012, WWE established NXT as their developmental territory, replacing Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). It was not until 2018, however, that a secondary championship was established for the brand. During the March 7, 2018, tapings of "NXT" (aired March 28), NXT General Manager William Regal announced a ladder match for to determine the inaugural NXT North American Champion. Later that night, EC3, Killian Dain, Adam Cole, Ricochet, Lars Sullivan, and Velveteen Dream were announced as the participants in the match. At the event, Cole won the match to become the inaugural champion.
While NXT had originally been established as WWE's developmental territory, the NXT North American Championship was introduced in the midst of NXT establishing itself as WWE's third major brand. This became official when NXT was moved to the USA Network in September 2019, thus making the NXT North American Championship a third secondary title for WWE, along with the WWE Intercontinental Championship and WWE United States Championship.
Brand designation history.
As its name implies, the championship was established for the NXT brand. However, the title is still eligible to switch brands during the annual WWE Draft.
Belt design.
The championship belt was unveiled by WWE executive and NXT head Triple H on April 3, 2018. Featuring three gold plates on a thick brown leather strap, the rounded center plate features a globe that only shows the continent of North America. The banner above the globe reads "North American" and above the banner is the NXT logo. The lower banner at the bottom of the globe reads "Champion". In what has become a prominent feature of WWE's championship belts, the two side plates feature a removable center section which can be customized with the champion's logos; the default side plates feature a vertical NXT logo on a globe. This was WWE's first secondary title to feature customizable side plates. It was the only NXT championship to feature the NXT logo for the default side plates until the introduction of the NXT Women's Tag Team Championship in 2021; the other NXT championships feature the WWE logo.
Reigns.
As of , , there have been twelve reigns between ten champions and one vacancy. The inaugural champion was Adam Cole. Velveteen Dream has the longest reign as champion at 231 days (209 days as recognized by WWE due to tape delay, but still the longest). Johnny Gargano has the most reigns at three, with his first reign being the shortest at 4 days (due to tape delay, however, WWE recognizes that Gargano's first reign lasted 25 days, thus recognizing his second reign as the shortest at 14 days). Dream is the youngest champion at 23 years old while Damian Priest is the oldest at 37.
Isaiah "Swerve" Scott is the current champion in his first reign. He won the title by defeating previous champion Bronson Reed on the June 29, 2021 episode of "NXT" in Orlando, Florida.

Pink Lemonade (song)

"Pink Lemonade" is a song recorded by English singer-songwriter James Bay, from his second studio album, "Electric Light" (2018). The song was released by Republic Records on 7 March 2018 as the second single off the album.
In April, Bay performed the song on "Late Night with Seth Meyers".
Music video.
The official music video was directed by Phil Andelman and released on 26 March 2018.
The clip opens with Bay wearing a sparkling crew neck sweater while he and his band play on an Ed Sullivan Show type of broadcast playing into the living rooms of quiet suburban homes. Bay, who takes on the role as an astronaut trapped on Earth, is seen sneaking into a house's garage late at night to build a rocket ship. The highly anticipated blast off at the end of the video reveals the truth — a young Bay sitting in a “rocket” made out of a silver cardboard box, and the fantasy of escaping our planet vanishes."
Bay said “The inspiration behind the video comes from the theme of escape that runs through the song. I was reminded of a time when I was about 4 years old and I told my parents I'd had enough of living with them and would be leaving home.”
Reception.
Rania Aniftos from "Rolling Stone" called the single “catchy” and a “delicious new rock song”.
Jon Blisten, also from "Rolling Stone," said ""Pink Lemonade" marks a notable departure from both the stripped-down folk of Bay's debut album, but also the textured electronic sound of "Electric Light's" lead single, "Wild Love". Instead, the tune embraces a dance-rock sound reminiscent of The Strokes or Hot Hot Heat."

J-Hope

 Jung Ho-seok (; born February 18, 1994), better known by his stage name J-Hope (stylized as j-hope), is a South Korean rapper, songwriter, dancer and record producer. In 2013, he made his debut as a member of South Korean boy band BTS, under Big Hit Entertainment.
J-Hope released his first solo mixtape, "Hope World", in 2018. The album was met with a positive reception, and its subsequent debut and peak at numbers 63 and 38 respectively, made him the highest-charting solo Korean artist on the US "Billboard" 200 at the time. In September 2019, he released the single "Chicken Noodle Soup" featuring Becky G. It debuted at number 81 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100, which made him the first member of BTS with a Hot 100 hit under his own name.
Life and career.
1994–2012: Early life.
J-Hope was born as Jung Ho-seok () on February 18, 1994, in Gwangju, South Korea, where he lived with his parents and older sister. Before debuting with BTS, he was part of the underground dance team Neuron and took dance classes at Gwangju Music Academy for six years, from 4th grade to his 1st year in high school, when he signed his contract with Big Hit Entertainment. J-Hope had been relatively well known for his skills in dance prior to his debut; he won various local prizes for dance, including placing first in a national dance competition in 2008. His skills in dance eventually led him to gain interest in singing, helping him to audition as an idol trainee. As a trainee, J-Hope was featured as a rapper in Jo Kwon's song "Animal", which was released in 2012.
2013–present: BTS and scheduled activities.
On June 13, 2013, J-Hope made his debut as a member of BTS on Mnet's "M! Countdown" with the track "No More Dream" from their debut single album "2 Cool 4 Skool". He was the third member to join the group as a trainee after RM and Suga. J-Hope has since been involved in the creation process of every album in BTS' discography.
On June 14, 2019, J-Hope, together with fellow BTS member V, collaborated with Zara Larsson on a soundtrack called A Brand New Day for a mobile game BTS World.
2018–present: Solo activities and first mixtape.
J-Hope released his first solo mixtape, "Hope World", worldwide on March 1, 2018. It was accompanied by a music video for the lead single "Daydream". A music video for the B-side "Airplane" was later released on March 6. The mixtape debuted at number 63 and peaked at number 38 on the "Billboard" 200, making him the highest charting Korean solo act on the chart up to that point. "Hope World" also peaked at number 35 on the Canadian Albums chart, and number 19 on the US Top Rap Albums chart. Three mixtape tracks, "Daydream", "Hope World", and "Hangsang", charted on the World Digital Songs Chart, at number 3, 16, and 24 respectively. The following week, the tracks rose to number 1, 6, and 11, with three additional tracks off of "Hope World", "Airplane", "Base Line", and "P.O.P (Piece of Peace) pt. 1" arriving on the chart at number 5, 6, and 12, respectively. "Daydream" peaking atop the chart made J-Hope one of only ten Korean artists, including BTS, to reach number one. The success of his solo debut lead him to rank at number 3 on the Emerging Artists Chart, and 97 on the Artist 100 Chart for the week of March 10, later peaking at number 91 for the week of March 17. He is the fifth Korean artist, and the second Korean soloist after Psy, to place on the Artist 100.
The mixtape charted in ten countries worldwide, with "Daydream" charting in three. It was ranked at number 5 on "Billboard" magazine's year-end World Albums Chart.
In 2019, J-Hope released a free collaboration single, "Chicken Noodle Soup", on September 27, featuring American singer, Becky G. The track debuted at number 81 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, with 9.7 million streams and 11,000 downloads for the week ending October 4, making J-Hope the first member of BTS to chart on the "Hot 100" as a solo artist outside of the group, the third Korean solo artist to rank on the chart (after Psy and CL), and the sixth Korean artist overall to do so. "Chicken Noodle Soup" also debuted at number 1 on the World Digital Songs chart and is J-Hope's second song to achieve this after 2018's "Daydream".
For the three-year anniversary of his mixtape, J-Hope released a full, three-minute long version of its closing track "Blue Side (Outro)" on March 1, 2021—it was uploaded to the BTS Soundcloud page for free.
Name.
His stage name, J-Hope (), comes from his desire to represent hope for fans, as well as to be "the hope of BTS". It is also a reference to the myth of Pandora's box, as after the box was opened and all the evils inside were released to the world, the only thing left was hope.
Artistry and public image.
J-Hope has been described as having an upbeat and energetic tone to his music and performances. His mixtape, "Hope World", was described as having a fun nature and variety of musical genres, including synth-pop, trap, house, alternative hip hop, funk-soul, and retro elements. In a review published by The 405, Emmad Usmani praised the mixtape's concept and production, writing "J-Hope showcases exceptional creativity, genuine personality, and a cohesive sense of direction over the 20 minutes of the project". Jeff Benjamin of "Fuse" wrote that the atmospheric style of "Blue Side", "Hope World"'s outro track, "leaves the listener curious for what's coming next from J-Hope". The lyrical elements of the mixtape, notably the lead song "Daydream", was praised by "Billboard" magazine for its discussion of the difficulties an idol faces in their career, various literary references, and fun presentation of the serious subject matter.
J-Hope cites the adventurous nature of Jules Verne's "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea" and the works of Kyle, Aminé, and Joey Badass as influencers on his style and work on "Hope World". The idea of peace has also provided a basis for much of his lyrics, stating that "it'd be fantastic to become a part of someone's personal peace through my music" in an interview with "Time" magazine. The idea of "representing the modern generation" has also influenced his work on BTS' music. There was also a reference to Douglas Adams' science fiction series "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy".
In January 2020, J-Hope was promoted to a full member of the Korea Music Copyright Association.
Impact.
In 2018, he was awarded the fifth-class Hwagwan Order of Cultural Merit by the President of South Korea along with the other members of the group. He had the most liked tweet in the world for 2018 when he posted the "In My Feelings Challenge".
Personal life.
In 2016, he purchased a luxury apartment in South Korea worth US$1.6 million for his personal use. As of 2018, he lives in Hannam-dong, Seoul, South Korea with his bandmates. In March 2019, along with bandmates RM and Suga, he enrolled at Hanyang Cyber University for the Master of Business Administration program in Advertising and Media.
Philanthropy.
J-Hope has been a member of the "Green Noble Club", which recognizes high-value donors of Child Fund Korea, since 2018. On February 18, 2019, he donated ₩100 million (approximately US$90,000) to the organization in support of those attending his high school alma mater in Gwangju. He had previously donated ₩150 million (roughly US$135,000) in December 2018, but requested the donation be private at the time. In December 2019, he donated another ₩100 million. On November 17, 2020, he donated ₩100 million in support of children experiencing economic difficulties amid the COVID-19 pandemic. On February 18, 2021, he donated ₩150 million to support children with visual and hearing impairments. On May 4, 2021, for Children's Day, he donated ₩100 million for children affected by violence in Tanzania, Africa.

You Taught My Heart to Sing

You Taught My Heart to Sing is an album by saxophonist Houston Person and pianist Bill Charlap recorded in 2004 and released on the HighNote label in 2006.
Reception.
The AllMusic review by Al Campbell said "the mood is relaxed yet not moribund, nor does the duo succumb to adding weepy strings or sappy horn arrangements. Person and Charlap don't break any new ground with this recording; rather they continue to showcase their combined enduring passion for ballads". In JazzTimes, Owen Cordle stated "In another era, this album might have been labeled “mood music.” It consists of tenor saxophonist Person and pianist Charlap in a set of mostly romantic standards. Person is restrained throughout, even when the tempo moves beyond a ballad pace, and Charlap is the ideal, ever-sensitive accompanist. If you appreciate melody, you’ll dig this album".

Deportivo Alavés Gloriosas

Deportivo Alavés Gloriosas is a Spanish women's football team from Vitoria-Gasteiz, Álava, Basque Country, currently playing in the Primera División. It is the women's section of Deportivo Alavés.
History.
Having begun the process of adding a women's football section to the club structure in the months prior, in summer 2017 Alavés had their new Gloriosas team installed directly into the second tier of the Spanish league setup as the result of a merger with established local club CD Gasteizko Neskak ("Vitoria Girls") who had just completed a season competing at that level.
Under the agreement, the Gasteizko Neskak senior team's players were adopted by Alavés and now play home matches at the professional club's Ciudad Deportiva José Luis Compañón (Ibaia) training ground, wearing Alavés colours. Dafne Triviño, the long-serving coach and coordinator of Gasteizko Neskak, was appointed as the women's section coordinator for Alavés.
During the first season following the merger, the Gloriosas team often continued to be referred to as Gasteizko Neskak.
Alavés previously had a women's team, in partnership with Club San Ignacio (not to be confused with of Bilbao), from 2010 to 2013.
In summer 2019, the club confirmed they would be introducing a women's reserve team in the provincial leagues to act as a step between the youth and senior levels.
In the 2020–21 season, played in a two-phase format due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, Alavés held off a challenge from Osasuna to win both the winter and spring regional groups and gain promotion to the Primera División for the first time.
Gasteiz Cup and Gasteizko Neskak.
Gasteizko Neskak, who wear pink-and-black and are based at the Betoño Sports Complex (also used by Alavés for training), continue to operate independently, with a second adult team in the "Territorial Femenina Araba" league (fourth level) as well as their existing youth teams, with support from Alavés as a 'partner club' in exchange for continued access to players.
For several years the organisation was known as CDF Gasteiz Cup, with the club hierarchy also arranging an annual youth tournament of the same name which attracted entrants from as far away as India – it was played for 18 years, the last edition held in 2014.
After winning the "Preferente Álava" league in 2010, Gasteiz Cup reached the "Primera Nacional" (second tier) in the 2010–11 season, finishing bottom of the table in their group. They are regular participants in international youth tournaments such as the Gothia Cup in Sweden. Yulema Corres, who won the Spanish league in 2016 with Athletic Bilbao, began her career with the club.

Joe Schember

Joseph Schember (born November 13, 1950) is an American banker and politician and serving as the 48th mayor of Erie, Pennsylvania. Schember previously served as a vice president of PNC Bank and as a member of the Erie City Council between 2006 and 2012.
On November 7, 2017, the people of Erie voted for the next Mayor and Schember won 53% of the vote to his Republican challenger John Persinger who gained 47% of the vote. The previous Mayor, Joseph E. Sinnott, served for 3 consecutive terms from 2006 to 2018 and ran unopposed in the latest election. Erie was at a decisive moment in its history as under Sinnott, Erie was kept out of Act 47 which is reserved for financially distressed cities.
Early life and education.
Joseph Schember was born on November 13, 1950, to the parents of Joseph and Helene Flatley Schember. He has two sisters, Mary Anne and Helene who is a Rocket Scientist with a Ph.D. in Fluid Mechanics from Cal Tech. In his youth, he attended Catholic School and studied to become a Priest. He left seminary to complete his degree at Gannon University where he met his wife, Rhonda Mahoney. Schember then received a Master's Degree in English at the University of Dayton and taught at Elk County Christian in St. Mary's, Pennsylvania.
Career.
He worked for PNC Bank for 40 years, starting as a teller and rising up to the level of Regional Manager of 51 branches for PNC in Northwestern Pennsylvania.
Erie city council, 2006–2012.
Schember served on City Council for six years, and was appointed as chairman of the Finance Committee in 2007. During his tenure, he oversaw the city of Erie move from a bleak financial state of a $12.7 million deficit in the General Fund in late 2005 to a $5 million surplus by 2012. In 2009 and in 2010, the City Council appointed Schember to be president of the City Council.
During the Citizens To Be Heard segment of the City Council Meetings, a local activist named Randy Barnes, who was president of an environmental group called Keep Erie's Environment Protected (K.E.E.P.), would continually lodge a conflict of interest complaint against Schember because he had employment with PNC Bank which was doing business with the city of Erie. In response to Randy Barnes complaints that he would lodge at each City Council meeting, Schember resigned May 8, 2012 with a letter that stated that he was "troubled by the lack of civility and unprofessionalism that has infected the Citizens To Be Heard segment of City Council Meetings."
Erie mayoral election, 2017.
Out of nine candidates running in the primary race for mayor, two remained in the run-up to the election: Democrat Joe Schember and Republican John Persinger. Republican nominee John Persinger eventually garnering 47% of the popular vote. Persinger emphasized eliminating blight with a campaign promise of "1,000 in 1,000 Days" initiative to remove 1,000 blightened properties in his first 1,000 days in office. He emphasized the role of broken windows theory, and said that if Erie is to prosper, Erie would need to address blight quickly.
Mayor of Erie.
Schember has initiated many changes to the mayoral governance of Erie since being elected into office. He wants to upgrade the technology of Erie, redesign the city of Erie's website, and hire a new digital media coordinator to focus on getting the city up to date with social media which under Sinnott's long mayoralty it lagged behind. 
Schember hired Erie's first full-time grant writer, Abby Skinner, to work on helping Erie access grant funding from the local, state and federal level. One of Schember's priorities is Erie Refocused, which is part of Erie's Comprehensive Plan to improve the city's economy and society. Skinner will focus on writing grants that will help Erie Refocused move forward.

Fort River

The Fort River is a river in Western Massachusetts and is a tributary of the Connecticut River and runs through the towns of, Amherst, Massachusetts, and ends in Hadley, Massachusetts.
The Fort technically begins as Adams Brook which begins at a pond near Atkin's Reservoir in Shutesbury, Massachusetts (however the ponds aren't part of the reservoir), and flows south-west ward until it reaches the spot where Amythest Brook flows into it, where it becomes the "Fort River." Although it has no dams or man-made things on the river, some of the Fort's tributaries have reservoirs.
The Fort River has a wide variety of wildlife due to it being the longest free-flowing tributary (having no dams or other man made changes made to the rivers shape or flow) of the Connecticut River. Because of this there is a lot of wildlife making it one of the 3 most diverse rivers in the state. Mussels, Eastern Pearlfish, Sea Lampreys, and American Eel's.

Thinking of You (Houston Person album)

Thinking of You is an album by saxophonist Houston Person which was recorded in 2007 and released on the HighNote label.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Michael G. Nastos states "Person, one of the more consistent jazz performers over the past few decades, is reliable primarily for his soft soul, which holds him and his fans in good stead. This CD is no less enjoyable than many others he has recently released, and is easily recommended". On All About Jazz, Karla Cornejo Villavincencio noted "On tracks like "Why Did I Choose You?" and "People," he exhibits a dexterity that most contemporary jazz musicians would envy". In JazzTimes, William Ruhlmann wrote: "the album provides numerous examples of Person’s usual virtues, not the least of them his abilities as a blues player ... this sounds like an album that could have been made any time in the last 40 years, but that only confirms Person’s consistency".

Desmond Harrison (American football)

Desmond Harrison (born October 8, 1993) is an American football offensive tackle who is a free agent. He played college football at Texas and later West Georgia.
College career.
Following his time at Contra Costa College, Harrison was seen as a top recruit after being named to the All-American Community College First Team. Harrison joined the Texas Longhorns for his junior year, but was deemed academically ineligible to play before the season started. This was because Harrison had taken an online course at Brigham Young University during his time at Contra Costa, and BYU's school policy stated that student-athletes from other universities could not receive credit from online courses. The NCAA later cleared Harrison to play. Harrison later missed the entire 2014 season after he was suspended a total of 3 times. He was able to use this as a redshirt year, but he was not able to rejoin the program for the 2015 season. After leaving Texas, he spent two years away from football, and later joined the West Georgia Wolves for the 2017 season. Following his senior season at West Georgia, Harrison was invited to the 2018 Senior Bowl.
Professional career.
At the 2018 NFL combine, Harrison garnered attention after running the 40-yard dash in 4.9 seconds, the 2nd fastest of any offensive line prospect at the combine. He also recorded an unofficial time of 4.75 seconds. Despite a strong combine, he was not selected in the 2018 NFL Draft.
Cleveland Browns.
Harrison signed with the Cleveland Browns as an undrafted free agent on May 4, 2018. After an impressive rookie training camp, the Browns named Harrison their starting left tackle on September 7, 2018. Following the Browns' firing of head coach Hue Jackson on October 29, 2018, Harrison was benched by interim head coach Gregg Williams in favor of Greg Robinson.
On June 5, 2019, Harrison was waived by the Browns after a missed flight caused him to miss the first day of Cleveland's mandatory mini-camp, deemed to be "one too many missteps" for Harrison.

Ingeborg Mohr

Ingeborg Mohr (1921 – 2004) was an Austrian-born Canadian artist.
She was born in Innsbruck. Although she was interested in art from a young age, she was discouraged from pursuing a career as an artist after she was diagnosed with polio at the age of 18. Mohr studied art history at the University of Breslau from 1943 to 1945. However, she went on to study art at the School of Fine Arts in Linz and at the School of Fine Arts in Graz. In 1952, she married Dr. J. W. "Hans" Mohr. She came to Canada with her husband and children in 1954. They first settled in Saskatchewan where she painted prairie landscapes in watercolour. They moved to Toronto in 1955. In 1981, she moved with her husband to Howe Island.
After she moved to Toronto, her painting changed from figurative to abstract expressionism. Mohr subsequently worked in batik for four years. After 1971, she used oil paint on paper. In 1975, she was named to the Ontario Society of Artists and, in 1980, was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. Her work was exhibited at the Robert McLaughlin Gallery, at Trent University, at Massey College of the University of Toronto, at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre, at Goethe-House and the Merton Gallery in Toronto and at the Simon Fraser Gallery in British Columbia.
She died on Howe Island at the age of 82.

Sovereign (1793 ship)

Sovereign was launched at Shields in 1793 as a West Indiaman. She made one voyage between 1795 and 1797 for the British East India Company (EIC), to New South Wales and then Bengal. She then resumed trading with the West Indies and was last listed in 1822.
Career.
"Sovereign" enters "Lloyd's Register" in 1794 with Storey, master, A. Towers, owner, and trade London–Tortola.
On 21 February 1795 Captain George Storey acquired a letter of marque. He then sailed "Sovereign" to New South Wales and on to Bengal on a voyage for the EIC. She was primarily carrying stores for Port Jackson, but she was also transporting one convict, Joseph Gerrald, a political reformer and one of the "Scottish Martyrs".
Storey and "Sovereign" sailed from The Downs on 24 May. She reached Rio de Janeiro on 24 July and arrived at Port Jackson on 5 November. Gerrald survived the journey but he was ill with tuberculosis and died in 1796. 
"Sovereign" left on 17 December, bound for Bengal. By 7 March 1796 she was at Sulu. She reached Penang on 1 April and arrived at Calcutta on 10 May.
On 12 May the "Calcutta Gazette" published Storey's account of conditions at Port Jackson. Campbell, Clarke and Co. were "Sovereign"s agents at Calcutta. On 30 May the country ship "Begum Shaw", Gavin (or Guy) Hamilton master and owner, arrived at Calcutta from Coringa. Campbell and Clark purchased her, retaining Hamilton as master. They renamed her , loaded her with a variety of produce and goods, and sent her to Port Jackson on speculation. She wrecked on the way.
Homeward bound, "Sovereign" was at Kedgeree on 15 July and the Cape of Good Hope on 7 October. She reached Saint Helena on 3 November and Cork on 8 January 1797, before arriving back at The Downs on 31 January.
On her return "Sovereign" resumed trading with the West Indies. "Lloyd's Register" for 1798 gives her master as P. Aylward, changing to S. Chapman, her owner as Baring &amp; Co., and her trade as London–Jamaica.
There is a report that "Sovereign", Captain Richarson, was wrecked on 24 January 1804 at Ballycotton, County Cork, with loss of life. She was on a voyage from Trinidad to Tortola and London. However, this was a different "Sovereign".
"Sovereign", of 362 tons (bm), launched at Shields in 1793, is no longer listed in "Lloyd's Register" in 1814. However, the "Register of Shipping" shows a "Sovereign", A. Smith, master, Dick &amp; Co. owners, and trade London-St Croix. "Lloyd's Register" has the same information. The "Register of Shipping" describes this "Sovereign" as being of 378 tons (bm), and of French origin. "Lloyd's Register" describes her as being of 377 tons, built at "Rochelle", and launched in 1809.
In 1815, "Lloyd's Register" lists two "Sovereign", one of 377 tons (bm), and one of 362 tons (bm). (The "Register of Shipping" lists only the French origin "Sovereign".) The 362-ton "Sovereign" has a launch year of 1794, and location of Sunderland.
Fate.
"Sovereign" is last listed in 1822 with information unchanged since 1820.

Madison Street Methodist Episcopal Church

Madison Street Methodist Episcopal Church is a Methodist Episcopal Church built in 1874 in Chester, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located at 701 Madison Street. The building is currently being used by the Wesley House Community Corporation as a homeless shelter.
History.
Due to the preachings of Bishop Francis Asbury in Chester, a Methodist meeting was formed in 1810 in the home of Mrs. Mary Withey who kept a house of public entertainment known as the Columbia House located at what is now Fifth and Market Streets.
The Methodist meetings moved to the home of John Kelley in 1818. Mr. Kelley had previously been a preacher in St. George's Church in Philadelphia. When the services became too large for his home, services were moved to the Chester Court House where Bishop Asbury preached on several occasions.
The services soon outgrew the capacity of the Chester Court House and it was decided that a small church should be built. Matthew L. Bevan secured a lot on the corner of Second and Bevan Street and a small chapel named Asbury Chapel was built.
Initially there was no regular minister for the Asbury Chapel and the congregation had to rely on circuit riders to preach to them. However, in 1845 the size of the congregation warranted the appointment of a resident pastor and the Reverend Isaac R. Merrill was assigned. The congregation continued to grow under Reverend Merrill and plans for construction of a larger church were initiated.
In 1848 a green serpentine stone church was erected on a plot of land on the north side of Fifth Street between Market and Edgemont Avenue. The building was used until 1874.
In 1872, another lot was purchased on the northeast corner of Seventh and Madison Streets and construction was initiated. On July 17, 1874 the Madison Street Methodist Episcopal Church was dedicated and opened for worship.
David Reese Esrey, the cotton goods manufacturer and banker, was president of the Board of Trustees of the Madison Street Methodist Episcopal Church and contributed liberally to the construction of the church.
On June 19, 1983, the Madison Street Methodist Episcopal Church congregation merged with the Christ United Methodist Church located at 600 Dutton Mill Road in Brookhaven, Pennsylvania.
The former Madison Street Methodist Episcopal Church is currently being used by the Wesley House Community corporation as a homeless shelter for families and single women. The facility has 17 rooms and provides shelter to over 240 individuals/75 households each year.

MihTy

MihTy (also written Mih-Ty) is the eponymous debut studio album by American duo MihTy, composed of Jeremih and Ty Dolla Sign. It was released on October 26, 2018, through Def Jam Recordings and Atlantic Records.
Background.
Ty Dolla Sign and Jeremih had previously collaborated on several songs before "MihTy". Work on the album was reportedly completed in December 2017. Ty Dolla Sign stated that over 60 songs were made for the album, recorded over eight sessions. Dolla Sign stated before the project's release that it was a "consistent album of bangers."
The album was delayed, with a release date of August 24 planned and was eventually released on October 26, 2018. The tracklist was revealed on October 23, 2018.
Promotion.
The lead single for the album, titled "The Light," was released on June 8, 2018. The song was described by "Billboard" as "a summer-ready banger" with 90's R&amp;B samples. A music video, taking place in a skate park, was released the following month. It was later certified Gold by the RIAA in 2020. This song was followed by the second single, "Goin Thru Some Thangz" on October 12, 2018. The two also performed on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!". A promotional single, "New Level" featuring Lil Wayne, was released for free on SoundCloud the day of the originally planned album release date.
Critical reception.
Writing for "Pitchfork", Austin Brown said that "Jeremih and Ty Dolla $ign are unquestionably the natural successors to the figure of the 'R&amp;B thug' that defined the R&amp;B charts for most of the aughts" and felt that with "MihTy", they have collaborated with producer Hitmaka to make a "project so buttery smooth that you might not realize how much it's at war with itself". Brown said that Hitmaka and the rest of the producers "bring neon synth pads and a dash of vaguely Balearic electronic sparkle to the proceedings, eschewing deference in favor of, oddly enough, a chillwave-y evocation of 1990s R&amp;B", which gives the singers a "woozy, classicist gilded cage in which [they are] set loose to ping-pong off each other". Trevor Smith of "HotNewHipHop" called the record "a rare joint album that is more than the sum of its parts", judging that "Ty and Jeremih's extensive collaborative experience and willingness to come together as a proper songwriting team is really what takes it home."

St. John Church (Hsinchu City)

The Church of St. John is a parish of the Roman Catholic Church located in North District, Hsinchu City, Taiwan. Part of the Diocese of Hsinchu, it is administered by the Congregation of the Holy Spirit (Spiritans), and under the pastoral responsibility of Bishop John Baptist Lee Keh-mien.
The current parish church opened for religious services in October 1957 with a capacity of 150 people.
History.
The first church was built in 1955 and originally dedicated to Saint Peter. It covered an area of only 1068 square feet., and so could only accommodate 30 people. For this reason, in 1957 Father Cai Weixian expanded the grounds to establish a new church. The new church was completed on October 27, and rededicated to Saint John. In November 2005, Father Victor Silva was the parish priest of St. John's Church, along with Jeanne d'Arc Church and Holy Rosary Church. Both congregations faced concern that over 80% in attendance at Sunday Mass were senior citizens.

Mellow (Houston Person album)

Mellow is an album by saxophonist Houston Person which was recorded in 2009 and released on the HighNote label.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Michael G. Nastos states "Not all mellow, Houston Person's tribute to the softer side of jazz has its moments based on the laid-back timbre of his soul rather than a program consisting of only ballads. The tenor sax he wields certainly reflects the tradition established by Ben Webster in its soul-drenched tone, but is not as vocally pronounced or vibrato-driven. ... That's not to say this marvelous tenor saxophonist has depreciated his talent as an adept technician, but at this point in his career he prefers this music on the mellow side, and has no problem staying interested in that mood, no matter the tempo". On All About Jazz, Andrew Velez noted "Houston Person's "Mellow" could easily have been called "Up Close and Personal." With dozens and dozens of recordings to his credit, it's just the latest in a long list of exemplary sets that always evidence the warmth of his tone and the directness of his tenor sax phrasing. Also mixed in as well is a funky R&amp;B feeling".

Saints Cyril and Methodius Catholic Church and Rectory

Saints Cyril and Methodius Catholic Church and Rectory, also known as North Side Church, is a historic church in Rock Springs, Wyoming. The Roman Catholic church was established by Slavic immigrants who found the established Catholic church in Rock Springs to be dominated by Irish parishioners and clergy, and who wished to have a church more closely aligned to their traditions. In 1925 they built their own church two blocks from Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church to replace a temporary church built in 1911. The architect was Daniel Spani and the builder was F.H. Cowell, a contractor from Denver. The basement of the older structure was re-used and expanded.
The church is primarily Romanesque Revival in style, built of brick made in Ogden, Utah. The church's chief feature is a spire over the main entrance. The sanctuary is rectangular, measuring about by . It is decorated with stained-glass windows with round arches. The church's apse includes two side altars in recesses. A loft is provided for the choir and organ over the entrance. The spire contains a belfry with four bells.
The rectory pre-dates the church. Built in 1920, it is a red brick house, also designed by Spani. The bungalow-style house had a front porch, since enclosed by an extension. The interior was finished with typical bungalow-style built-ins.
Saints Cyril and Methodius Catholic Church was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 22, 2015.

Mercedes Arias

Mercedes Arias (ca. 1860 – 7 January 1954) was a Puerto Rican musician and composer from Ponce, Puerto Rico. Among her compositions are "Renacimiento" (Renaissance), and "Flores y Perlas" (Flowers and Pearls).
Professional career.
Arias was trained by Juan Morel Campos and Julio Arteaga. She was "one of the greatest pianists and composers Ponce had". Her compositors are "saturated with beauty." Among them are "Renacimiento" (Renaissance), and "Flores y Perlas" (Flowers and Pearls). She was one of the first musician contracted by Jaime Pericas Díaz in his concert hall orchestra in 1926. She was also highly applauded and regarded in her solo concerts. Under the leadership of Juan Morel Campos, Lizzie Graham and Arias, many representations, concerts, discussions and recitals occurred in Ponce. She also worked at Teatro Delicias interpreting the piano sound synchronization that accompanied the soundless films of the time. During the 1880s, Julio Arteaga, Juan Ríos Ovalle and Mercedes Arias would often perform together at popular events.
Personal life.
Arias was a student of Juan Morel Campos. Many people who know about Arias, get their knowledge through stories about Juan Morel Campos, as it is said that Mercedes Arias was Morel Campos's secret love. The story goes that the two saw each other romantically in the evenings in what is now Callejon Amor/Paseo Arias. However, due to race issues, her family did not approve of the relationship and they were never married. There was a lot of gossip in the streets of Ponce regarding the platonic love between Morel Campos and Arias.
Music teacher.
Among her disciples was the father of Hector Campos Parsi and who, together with his wife, were decisive in influencing the future musical career of little Hector. Arias would also volunteer her time in local public school activities related to music classes. For example, in 1904 she funded herself to travel to New York City with a group of public school educators from Ponce in support of two music teachers in that group. In 1892, Arias organized a concert to showcase the advancement her students had made. Among her disciples were Elisa Tavárez, Amelia Serra, Lila Salazar, Leonor Valdivieso, Celina Besosa, María Rodríguez, Panchita Colón, and María Laguna and Mercedes Laguna.
Death.
It has been said that in her deathbed, Arias asked to be buried with copies of the musical compositions that Morel Campos had dedicated to her. She was buried at the Cementerio Católico San Vicente de Paul cemetery.

Peder Fylling

Peder Carolus Jonsen Fylling, also known as Per Fylling (September 26, 1818 – November 3, 1890), was a Norwegian folk material collector, book and antique collector, local historian, and author of cultural history books and articles.
Fylling was born at the Fylling farm in Skodje in Norway's Sunnmøre region, the son of John Fylling and Ragnhild Sorte. His father was interested in history and he passed along both his knowledge and this interest to his son. Fylling read books that he borrowed from the priests in the district and from the Daae family at the Solnør farm. Because of sickness, Fylling gave up his right to the farm in Skodje and dedicated himself to historical studies instead. He tirelessly traveled around the district, looking for old items, antiquities, folk poetry, old documents, and letters. Fylling sent his own manuscripts to the museum in Bergen, where he also sent old items and ancient artifacts that he found in the district.
In mid-June 1862, Henrik Ibsen arrived in Sunnmøre with a grant from the "Collegium Academicum", the governing body at Royal Frederick University, to collect legends and folk tales. He stayed with Ludvig Daae at the Solnør farm, and it was probably Daae that who put Ibsen in touch with Peder Fylling. Ibsen's travel journal ends with his arrival at Sjøholt on July 17, 1862, after which he wrote the heading "Stories told by Peder Fylling" ("Sagn fortalte af Peder Fylling"). The material leaves no doubt that Ibsen obtained what he was looking for from Fylling. Fylling spent three days talking to Ibsen, who wrote down a series of legends and a few folk tales.
Ibsen published four of the legends in the magazine "Illustreret Nyhedsblad" in the fall of 1862. Magdalene Thoresen, Ibsen's mother-in-law, had also met Peder Fylling. Thoresen used the stories that she heard from Fylling in her volume "Billeder fra Vestkysten af Norge" (Pictures from the West Coast of Norway, 1872). The folk material collector Thrond Sjursen Haukenæs also visited Fylling at his home in Skodje. Haukenæs wrote the following about Fylling's work: "May many more appreciate Peder Fylling's activities, and may this often be carried out by men from the peasantry who ought to possess his investigative spirit for the benefit of the country and its people."
Fylling himself published the volume "Folkesagn samlede paa Søndmør 1ste Del" (Folk Material Gathered in Sunnmøre, Part 1) in 1874. The second part was published in 1877, and the last part in 1942, 52 years after his death. Fylling mostly wrote in a rigid Riksmål form that was far from his own dialect, and only once did he write in his local dialect. He also did not have much contact with the work of his contemporary Ivar Aasen, who lived with the Daae family at Solnør for seven years.
Fylling died at the Fylling farm.

Lynching of Willie James Howard

Willie James Howard (July 13, 1928 – January 2, 1944) was a 15-year-old African-American living in Live Oak, Suwannee County, Florida. He was lynched for having given Christmas cards to all his co-workers at the Van Priest Dime Store, including Cynthia Goff, a white girl, followed by a letter to her on New Year's Day.
New Year's Day letter.
The New Year's Day letter read:
Dear Friend,
Just a few line[s] to let you hear from me [.] I am well an[d] hope you are the same. This is what I said on that [C]hristmas card. From W. J. H. With L. [love] I hope you will understand what I mean. That is what I said[.] [N]ow please don’t get angry with me because you can never tell what may get in some body[.] I did not put it in there my self. God did[.] I can't help what he does[,] can I[?] I know you don’t think much of our kind of people but we don’t hate you all[.] [W]e want to be your all friends but you want let us [.] [P]lease don't let any body see this[.] I hope I haven't made you [mad.] [I]f I did tell me about it an[d] I will [forget] about it. I wish this was [a] northern state[.] I guess you call me fresh. Write an[d] tell me what you think of me[,] good or bad. Sincerely yours, with, [sic]
 From Y.K.W.
Fo[r] Cynthia Goff
I love your name. I love your voice, for a S.H. [sweetheart] you are my choice.
Reaction to letter and death of Willie James Howard.
Cynthia was offended by the card and letter, and gave them to her father A.P. "Phil" Goff, the Live Oak postmaster and a former state legislator.
Goff, along with S.B. McCullers and Reg H. Scott, allegedly went to Willie's house and took the youth from his mother at gunpoint. They picked up Willie's father, James Howard, at the Bond-Howell Lumber Company where he worked, then drove to the Suwannee River east of Suwannee Springs, where they bound Willie by the hands and feet, and forced the youth to choose between getting shot and jumping into the Suwannee River. After his father said he could do nothing to save him, Willie jumped into the river and drowned. Goff, McCullers, and Scott signed an affidavit which stated that they had only wanted James Howard to whip his son and, rather than be whipped by his father, Willie had committed suicide by jumping into the river. James Howard also signed the affidavit, but after selling his home and moving to Orlando, he recanted. Harry T. Moore, of the NAACP, interviewed the parents. After a county grand jury failed to indict, Moore was able to get a federal investigation started, but no convictions followed. Goff, McCullers, and Scott died without having to face murder charges.
Aftermath.
A documentary film on the murder, "Murder on the Suwannee River", was produced in 2006 by Marvin Dunn, a historian, who tried to get Charlie Crist, then attorney general and later governor of Florida, to reopen the case, but to no avail; neither was his case investigated under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. It is frequently cited as comparable to the case of Emmett Till, who was also lynched (at age 14) for allegedly making advances at a white woman at a grocery store.
Tameka Hobbs wrote about the lynching and three other lynchings in her 2015 book "Democracy Abroad, Lynching at Home: Racial Violence in Florida".

Sarah Chinnery

Sarah Johnston Chinnery (; 1887 – 1970) was a British-Australian photographer and diarist, known for her photographs and diaries of sixteen years in the Territory of Papua New Guinea during the 1920s and 30s.
Early life.
Born Sarah Johnston Neill in Belfast, Northern Ireland, she moved to the town of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, England at the age of 13, where her older brothers operated a dental surgery. Her interest in photography began when one of her brothers gave her a "Little Nipper" camera. Originally employed to "keep house" in her brothers' surgery, Neill qualified as a dentist herself and replaced her brother Bob in the practice when he left to serve in the army during the First World War.
Many of her dental patients at the time were from the large army camp nearby, and in 1918, she met Ernest Chinnery (known as Pearson Chinnery or "Chin")–an Australian observer lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps. They married in April 1919, and lived in Cambridge where Pearson Chinnery studied and lectured in anthropology at Cambridge University.
New Guinea.
Pearson received a grant from the Royal Geographical Society in 1920, and the couple moved to Melbourne, Australia later that year while they considered moving to New Guinea where Pearson had previously served as a magistrate. He moved there later in the year as director of native labour for New Guinea Copper Mines, with Sarah joining him in Port Moresby in 1921. In 1924, Pearson was appointed government anthropologist of the Territory of New Guinea, and they moved to Rabaul.
The Chinnerys spent sixteen years in New Guinea, where Sarah regularly took solo trips around the territory to take photographs of the landscape and the indigenous people. Unlike most ethnographic photography of the time, Chinnery's photographs were not staged and were respectful depictions of local residents in their daily lives. Chinnery did not exhibit her work during her lifetime, but her photographs were published in several of Australia's major newspapers, along with articles and anecdotes written by her. In March 1935, she produced a three-page article and photo spread for the weekend magazine of "The New York Times".
In addition to her photographic work, Chinnery kept extensive diaries of her time in New Guinea and Papua. She began to rewrite her diaries as a book in the mid-1930s, but abandoned this work after the in Rabaul, after which she returned to Australia. Her manuscripts were typed up by her four daughters and donated to the National Library of Australia, which published them in 1998 as "Malaguna Road: The Papua and New Guinea Diaries of Sarah Chinnery", edited by Kate Fortune.
Later life.
Chinnery died at Sandringham Hospital in Melbourne on 24 March 1970, aged 83. She was survived by her husband (who died in 1972), and their four daughters.

Moment to Moment (Houston Person album)

Moment to Moment is an album by saxophonist Houston Person which was recorded in 2010 and released on the HighNote label.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Ken Dryden states "In his mid-seventies at the time of this record date, tenor saxophonist Houston Person shows no signs of slowing down; he's accompanied here by musicians who are, for the most part, at least a generation younger. Person's lush tone is a major part of the standards of the date". On All About Jazz, Greg Simmons noted "Those expecting a deeply relaxed, background-music affair may be in for a mild surprise. Person hasn't suddenly become a hyper-aggressive free-jazz screamer, but the disc opens at a quick pace and returns to it periodically throughout ... "Moment to Moment" has everything to be expected in a Houston Person album, then adding a little bit more, making it another fine entry in Person's string of excellent HighNote releases".

Scotland–Ireland Euro 2008 bid

Scotland–Ireland '08 was an unsuccessful bid by the Scottish Football Association (SFA) and the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) to host the 2008 UEFA European Championships. In February 2002, the Scottish FA and the FA of Ireland officially confirmed a joint bid for Scotland and the Republic of Ireland to host the 2008 UEFA European Championships. Had the bid been successful, it would have been the first major competition hosted by both nations and the first held on the British Isles since UEFA Euro 1996, hosted by England.
By the conclusion of the bidding process, Scotland had hosted three major international tournaments at youth level, the 1970 UEFA European Under-18 Championship, the 1989 FIFA U-16 World Championship and the 1998 UEFA European Under-16 Championship, as well as three UEFA Champions League finals and a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final. Ireland had no experience in hosting international football tournaments at any level, although they hosted matches in the Rugby World Cup in 1991 and 1999 along with Scotland and the other Five Nations countries.
History.
Prior to the official announcement of the bid between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, the Scottish FA refused to rule-out a four-way Celtic bid consisting Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland. This four-way proposal never came to fruition.
In the summer of 2000, the FAI chief executive Bernard O’Byrne held an exploratory meeting with his counterparts from the SFA, Irish Football Association and Football Association of Wales regarding the possibility of a four-way Celtic bid for Euro 2008.
In July 2000, SFA chief executive David Taylor announced that Scotland would bid to host the European Championships in 2008, with the preference of the Scottish FA at the time being for Scotland to host the tournament of its own. However, Taylor noted "if we have to broaden it out and talk to other nations, we would." At the same time, Taylor announced the bid would enhance if England failed to the secure hosting rights for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. On 6 July 2000, England was eliminated from the second round of voting for the host of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which was ultimately won by Germany.
In May 2001, the SFA and the Scottish Executive gave their support, in principle, to Scotland hosting the European Championships after a report said there were no "insurmountable" problems, with Scottish First Minister Henry McLeish pledging the full backing of the Executive to a bid by Scotland on its own. McLeish resigned from his position as First Minister in November 2001, amid a scandal involving allegations that he sublet part of his Westminster constituency office without declaring the income from the sublets when he claimed his office expenses.
The new First Minister Jack McConnell withdrew support for a solo Scottish bid, favouring a joint bid with Ireland following UEFA's decision to require eight stadia from the host country, rather than the previous six.
The proposal for a joint bid between Scotland and Ireland was approved by the FAI and, on 27 February 2002, a letter was sent to UEFA announcing the Irish and Scottish intention to bid for the tournament. On 29 May, the bidding team sent a document detailing their proposals for hosting the competition to UEFA.
On 15 May 2002, Hampden Park in Glasgow hosted the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final between Bayer Leverkusen and Real Madrid, with an estimated £15 million boost for the local economy. Organisers of the final believed that the showcase final could help the bid to host the 2008 European Championships.
Simon Lyons, marketing director for the bid, noted that Scotland and Ireland offered the most seats of any bid, 1.7 million, at the eight stadia which would be used, with the four-way Nordic bid being the closest to this with 1.2 million seats. Lyons also noted the friendly atmosphere from both Ireland and Scotland fans in recent tournaments and the passion for football in both nations as another reason for UEFA to support the bid.
On 16 September 2002, UEFA's inspectors began their five-day visit to the bidding countries. It was reported that Croke Park had been identified as a potential UEFA Champions League final venue as a result of the inspection, should the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) abolish Rule 42 of their constitution preventing competitor sports to Gaelic sports to be played at the stadium. The, then new, GAA president Sean Kelly appeared to favour softening the organisations regulations for the tournament. UEFA's technical report gave the Scotland–Ireland bid a score of 94%, a percentage point lower than the Austria–Switzerland bid which had the best technical report.
On 12 December 2002, UEFA awarded the Championships to Austria and Switzerland, with UEFA's national team committee putting forward Austria-Switzerland, Greece-Turkey, Hungary and the four-way Nordic bid as their recommendations of the four best bids ahead of the final vote. The Scotland–Ireland bid came fourth overall in the final vote.
Venues.
Bidding nations were required to provide eight stadia to be used for the tournament. The bid consisted of ten potential stadia within six locations, which would be reduced to eight for the final competition. Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dublin all had multiple stadia within their cities that could have been used for the tournament.
The bid included using the three major football stadia in Glasgow - each requiring little modification due to recent renovations. Ibrox, the home of Rangers, had been rebuilt in between 1978 and 1981 in response to the 1971 Ibrox disaster, replacing the historic ground with a state-of-the-art all-seater stadium. Further renovations took place in 90s to expand the stadium to over 50,000 seats. The Taylor Report, into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, made redevelopment of Glasgow's two other major football stadia necessary to comply with new ground regulations. Celtic Park, owned by Celtic, was completely rebuilt over a four period from 1994 to 1998, making it the largest club ground in the whole UK at the time of completion. Hampden Park was the national football stadium in Scotland and had been re-developed in a number of stages across the 90s. The final phase was completed in 1999, with the 1999 Scottish Cup Final being the first match at the ground since the completion of the project.
Two stadia in the Scottish capital, Edinburgh, were earmarked for the bid. Murrayfield, the national rugby union ground, had also gone through major re-development in the 1990s, becoming the largest stadium in Scotland in the process. Easter Road underwent work in the previous decade, but would have required expansion to comply with the requirements to host European Championship matches - UEFA sets the minimum capacity for venues at 30,000. The East Stand would have been replaced by a new three-tier stand to double the capacity of the stadium.
Aberdeen and Dundee would have potentially seen new stadia to replace the existing grounds in the two cities. Aberdeen's Pittodrie Stadium would have been replaced with a 31,400 seat stadium as part of a modern leisure park on the outskirts of the city, which would incorporate a football academy. The football club would move into the new stadium following the completion of the tournament. The new stadium in Dundee would replace two existing stadia in the city: Dens Park, owned by Dundee, and Tannadice Park, owned by Dundee United. Both football clubs would share the stadium, a rarity for professional football in the UK, with the Scottish Claymores American football team relocating from Hampden Park in order to play matches at the new stadium. The ground would feature a retractable roof.
Only two of the three of a renovated Easter Road and the new stadia in Aberdeen and Dundee would have been used as part of the bid, with the three Glasgow stadia and Murrayfield being confirmed stadia by the conclusion of the bidding process.
Three stadia were included as potential venues within the Republic of Ireland, while only two would be used. The Gaelic Athletic Association's (GAA) Croke Park, in Dublin, was the biggest stadium in Ireland and had been going through extensive renovation at the time of the bid, being completed in 2004. The stadium hosted the finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, in Gaelic football, and the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. A major sticking point of using Croke Park was the GAA's rules on allowing 'foreign' sports to take place at the ground. The GAA constitution, up until 1971, had been stricter, however, stating a member of the organisation could be banned from competing in Gaelic sports if found to be also playing association football, rugby or cricket. The years following the conclusion of the bid, the GAA allowed both the Football Association of Ireland and the Irish Rugby Football Union to play their respective sports at the stadium during the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road.
Proposals to erect a new stadium in Abbotstown, Castleknock were also made, with most of the funding coming from the Irish Government. The stadium, called Stadium Ireland, was viewed to be central to the Irish part of the bid, but plans to construct the ground were aborted despite over €500 million (£315m) being spent on the project. The Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat centre-right coalition in Ireland had made major spending cuts in the country prior to UEFA's vote on hosting the Championships, which was considered the primary reason for the plug being pulled on the project. Had the stadium been built, it was envisioned that it would have become the home of the Irish national football and rugby union teams, as well as a national stadium for Gaelic games within Ireland.
Dublin's Lansdowne Road was also part of the proposals that would've seen the stadium redeveloped had the Stadium Ireland project collapsed. The stadium was owned by the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), with an all-seated capacity of 36,000, requiring the use of temporary seating to reach this figure due to the presence of terracing within the stadium. There were 23,000 permanent seats in the stadium. In the years following the bid, the stadium was replaced by the 51,700 seat Aviva Stadium, partially built with money initially planned to go Stadium Ireland project. The IRFU and the FAI contributed money towards the project, as well. The new stadium opened in 2010.
SFA's chief executive David Taylor said that the bid envisioned Scotland hosting the opening match, three group stages, three quarter finals, one semi final and the final match, with the Republic of Ireland staging one group phase, one quarter final and one semi final. The final bid saw changes to the initial plan with stadia in Scotland hosting both semi-finals, as well as the final. Murrayfield would be the final venue, with Hampden and Celtic Park each hosting a semi-final match.
List of venues.
The following venues would have been used for the finals:
Aftermath.
Commentators and bid officials attempted to seek reasons for why the bid failed. Cited reasons included the issue of having three stadia within the city of Glasgow, the uncertainty over whether Ireland could provide two suitable stadia for the competition, the lack of time between Euro 2008 and the previous major competition hosted in the British Isles, political voting within UEFA, a persevered lack of unity within the Irish Government, the financial visibility of the bid and adverse media coverage within Scotland regarding the bid.
UEFA's President Lennart Johansson and chief executive Gerhard Aigner claimed that the presence of Ireland within the bid and the issue regarding which stadia would be used in Ireland were not factors in the rejection of the bid. Johansson, who wasn't able to vote until the Nordic bid was eliminated from voting, stated that he was shocked that the bid did not progress beyond the first round of voting, insisting that he would have voted for the bid had he been able to vote. He also suggested that FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who defeated Johansson in the 1998 FIFA presidential election, may have had an involvement in ensuring that the Austria–Switzerland bid won.
It was reviled in documents realised by in 2018, that the Scottish Executive's Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport Mike Watson claimed in a cabinet meeting that the bid was "as good as the winning bid", while suggesting that "the Republic of Ireland was unable to meet their end of the bargain". He told the cabinet that the £500,000 spent by the Executive on the bid was not wasted and useful lessons had been learned from the bid process.
Some of the Scottish media claimed that the Irish Government were being caught up in electoral issues ahead of the 2002 Irish general election held in the May prior to the UEFA vote, which negatively impacted on Ireland's ability to make firm commitments over stadia and funding.
UEFA Euro 2016.
On 14 March 2006, UEFA's president Johannsen said that Ireland, Scotland and Wales should consider a three-way bid for UEFA Euro 2016. Later in the month, Scottish FA chief executive David Taylor said that they wouldn't proceed with a three-way bid, but didn't rule out a bid involving Scotland for the tournament. In December 2006, the Football Association of Wales (FAW) announced it was tentatively considering the possibility of jointly hosting the tournament, with the Scottish Football Association. There was discussion over whether Scotland should consider a solo bid for Euro 2016.
The election of a Scottish National Party government, in May 2007, enhanced the chances of a bid for Euro 2016. Comments by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond suggested that a Scotland–Wales bid may be considered, but a solo Scotland bid would be preferential if logistically possible. In November 2007, Salmond announced that a feasibility study would take place.
In June 2008, both Salmond and Welsh First Minister Rhodri Morgan became supportive of a joint Scotland–Wales bid, particularly when the increase in size of the tournament, from sixteen countries to twenty-four, was announced. The FAW confirmed, that month, that it had held talks with the Scottish FA regarding a joint bid for Euro 2016. FAW secretary David Collins pointed to the new stadia being built in Wales at the time as a reason for Wales to be involved in a bid.
In December 2008, it was reported that Irish Football Association, from Northern Ireland, would be involved in talks, along with the Scottish and Welsh Football Associations over co-hosting the tournament in 2016.
On 1 March 2009, Scotland and Wales officially cancelled their plans to host the competition owing to the economic downturn.
The Welsh Deputy First Minister and Minister for the Economy and Transport Ieuan Wyn Jones stated that the money required to host the event was excessive. "The cost of bringing other venues up to this standard would run into tens of millions of pounds. In the current economic and financial climate, this is unaffordable."
The tournament was ultimately hosted in France, after their bid defeated competition from Italy and Turkey.
UEFA Euro 2020.
Scotland and Ireland were both involved in a short-lived bid, with Wales, for UEFA Euro 2020. On 15 May 2012, the three countries officially announced their declared an interest in bidding for the tournament. Football Association of Wales chief executive Jonathan Ford said that the declaration of interest doesn't commit the nations to a bid: "It is not a bid, it's a declaration of interest and that will allow us to obtain the information from Uefa so that we can fully assess and determine, independently and together, whether we should submit a bid."
In May 2012, UEFA announced that the competition would be held in multiple stadia across Europe, rather than in a single, or multiple, host countries, opening the possibility of Euro 2020 matches being hosted in the Celtic nations. Ireland proposed that the newly built Aviva Stadium, the replacement of Lansdowne Road, could host matches, while Scotland put forward Hampden Park as a potential venue.
On 19 September 2014, UEFA announced that Dublin, Ireland and Glasgow, Scotland would be host cities for the 2020 European Championships, with the two cities hosting three group games and a round of sixteen match each. Wales, who was initially involved in the Celtic bid for Euro 2020, failed in their bid to bring Euro 2020 matches to Cardiff. The tournament will take place in twelve cities in twelve different countries. However, the UEFA Executive Committee removed Dublin as a host city on 23 April 2021 due to a lack of guarantees regarding spectators caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (with their matches reallocated to Saint Petersburg for the group stage and London for the round of 16).

Death at Nuremberg

Death at Nuremberg is the fourth novel in the Clandestine Operations Series by W.E.B. Griffin and William E. Butterworth IV.
Plot.
This novel centers around Capt. James Cronley, the central character of all the novels of the series. Cronley has been replaced as chief of DCI Europe to protect the U.S. chief prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials from a rumored Soviet kidnapping. He soon gets charged with hunting down the leadership of Odessa, an organization that helps Nazi war criminals escape to South America. As Cronley gets closer to uncovering the workings of Odessa, he is targeted twice for assassination. Cronley's quest takes him to his mother's home town of Strasbourg and to Vienna. At Strasbourg he picks up his cousin Luther, who turns out to be a war criminal himself and is taken to Nuremberg. As with the other books in this series, "Death at Nuremberg" is filled with intrigue as agents of the fledgling CIA work to rid the United States of enemies in Europe.
Reviews.
The Real Book Spy website liked this book, up to a point, saying in its review of it, "While it’s a step up from last year’s Curtain of Death, this year’s offering is still bloated with unnecessary sequences and far too many throwaway characters." The historical novel society was also lukewarm in its review of this book, saying, "Readers who enjoy twisty stories and the convoluted politics and maneuverings following war may enjoy this novel, but those seeking tension and suspense may want to look elsewhere."
Elise Cooper, in a review in the BlackFive website, made a more positive evaluation of this book, "Griffin’s signature writing style is very evident as he blends humor, espionage, danger, and great characters in his latest novel."A review in the bookreporter website also liked this book.

Sandy McIntosh

 Sandy McIntosh is an American poet, editor, memoirist, software developer, and teacher.
Early life and education.
McIntosh was born in Rockville Centre, New York. He attended the Waldorf School until seventh grade, when he was enrolled at the New York Military Academy, from which he graduated, at the suggestion of Fred Trump, a business acquaintance of McIntosh's father. Trump's son Donald was told to help the younger McIntosh navigate school. McIntosh, an underclassman, was enrolled because his father felt he needed to get rid of "all that spiritual nonsense" of his Waldorf School education. McIntosh has written and been interviewed extensively about how the New York Military Academy's culture of hazing formed Donald Trump's behavior.
He received a BA from Southampton College, L.I.U., an MFA from The School of the Arts, Columbia University and a Ph.D. from the Union Institute &amp; University. While at Southampton College, McIntosh participated in informal apprenticeships with the poet David Ignatow and the poet, novelist and translator H.R. Hays.
Career.
A poet, memoirist and writer known for wry reconsideration of the familiar, his work has appeared in The "New York Times", "The Daily Beast", the "New York Daily News", "The Wall Street Journal", "American Book Review", "Talisman: A Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics", in print, and in online journals.
His interviews include Phillip Lopate, and Carlos Castaneda scholar and Native American Activist, Jay Courtney Fikes.
McIntosh headed up the H.R. Hays Distinguished Poets series at Guild Hall from 1980 to 2000. His original poetry in a screenplay won the Silver Medal in the Film Festival of the Americas. His collaboration with Denise Duhamel, "237 More Reasons to Have Sex", appears in The Best American Poetry. 
In the early 1980s, he edited "Wok Talk", a Chinese cooking periodical published by Newsletter Publishing Associates and created an early computer software recipe program, "The Best of Wok Talk".

Racism in Oregon

The history of racism in Oregon began before the territory even became a U.S. state. The topic of race was heavily discussed during the convention where the Oregon Constitution was written in 1857. In 1859, it became the only state to enter the Union with a black exclusion law, although there were many other states that had tried before, especially in the Midwest. The Willamette Valley is notorious for hosting white supremacist hate groups. Discrimination and segregation are common occurrences against people of African, Mexican, Hawaiian, and Asian descent. Portland, the largest city in the state, continues to have one of the largest proportions of white residents of major U.S. cities.
History.
First arrival of black people: 1788.
The first known person of African descent to arrive in Oregon was a sailor named Markus Lopeus. Lopeus arrived in 1788 alongside merchant sea captain Robert Gray. Lopeus later died in an altercation with the local Native Americans. In the following years black fur trappers and explorers settled in Oregon.
York, an enslaved man, was the only African American on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which reached Oregon in 1805.
Anti-Black Exclusion Laws and Chinese immigration: 1844–1859.
There are two incidents that led up to the creation of the first Black Exclusion Law of 1844 in Oregon Territory. The first is called the Cockstock Affair, which is known to be the largest instance of potential violence against white settlers prior to the Whitman Incident in 1847. The Cockstock Affair started because James Saules (a black settler) reported that a Native, known as Cockstock, had stolen his newly purchased horse. White settlers who deemed themselves to be in charge of the territory tried to arrest Cockstock but were met with a force of Natives much bigger than their own. Eventually, the Affair was resolved but it left a good amount of fear in the white settlers for the potential threat the Native population posed. The second incident is referred to as the Saules-Pickett Dispute. Once again, the black settler James Saules (who had been in Oregon since 1841) was involved. Pickett accused Saules of assault and said in court during the trial that Saules threatened to incite the Natives against him. Other witnesses claimed they had also been threatened by Saules and his Native friends. No evidence to these claims was given. Saules was tried and convicted by a jury of Pickett's peers.
Peter Burnett saw these incidents as his opportunity to present a new bill to the provisional government of the territory. He claimed that it was to prevent slavery from entering Oregon. However, he used the Cockstock Affair and the Saules-Pickett dispute as evidence to persuade fellow lawmakers to exclude blacks from settling at all, for fear that they would band together with the Natives against the white settlers. In June 1844, Oregon enacted an Exclusion Law, banning black people from living in Oregon. Violation of this law resulted in 39 lashes, every six months, until the occupant left. This punishment was deemed too harsh and was replaced with forced labor in December 1844. Also in 1844, the provisional government prohibited slavery. Another discriminatory law was erected in 1849. This law barred Black people who were not already in the area from entering or residing in the Oregon territory. In 1851, a black businessman named Jacob Vanderpool was arrested and expelled from Oregon due to violating the laws regarding black residency.
In 1855 mixed race men were forbidden from becoming citizens. In 1857, despite slavery being illegal, a bill was proposed intending to protect slave property. It was not passed as it was seen as granting special rights to slave owners. That same year a new law was introduced which barred black people from holding property in the state. In 1850 the first Chinese immigrants would arrive and further immigration would take place over the coming decades.
In 1859 Oregon became the only state to enter the Union with a black exclusion law, introducing a new law the same year, prohibiting Black people from owning property and making contracts. Despite being rarely enforced, these laws help certify Oregon as a majority white state. The exclusion laws would remain in effect until 1926. In 2001, Measure 14 was introduced which was meant to eliminate the language (such as "free Negroes and mulattoes") from the constitution. While the constitution itself would not be completely altered, the language would be changed, the measure was voted down in 2002, but later passed.
Ultimately, the Oregon Territorial government and the writers of the Oregon Constitution used the excuse of preventing slavery from entering Oregon to hide their true ambitions. They were not abolitionists but white supremacists. They wanted to create a white utopia. The motivations of these lawmakers were to remove people of color from their territory and in working towards that goal created laws that have had long lasting consequences.
Anti-Chinese exclusion laws, expulsions, massacres: 1862–1920s.
An article in the "Daily Oregonian" decried the Chinese population as a racial menace who were polluting some of the city’s "best streets". Similar remarks were made about the Chinese residents in Baker City calling them "Celestials", "Mongolians", and "Yellow Horde". In 1862, all people of Black, Chinese, Hawaiian, and Mulatto descent were taxed $5 ($128 in 2020 dollars). Failure to pay this tax would result in the state being able to force them into jobs maintaining state designed roads for 50 cents a day ($12 in 2020 dollars). Interracial marriage between black and white people was outlawed the same year, with the law specifically stating that white people could not marry anyone one-fourth black or more. This distinction was later extended to prevent white people from marrying anyone who was one-fourth or more Chinese or Hawaiian, and a half or more Native American.
In 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was passed, granting citizenship to black people. Oregon originally ratified the Fourteenth Amendment on September 19, 1866, but rescinded that ratification on October 16, 1868. That Amendment was only re-ratified on April 25, 1973. In 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibited denying the right to vote too racial minorities and former slaves, gained widespread ratification with Oregon being one of eight states to reject it (in addition to New York's rescission of ratification). That same year the federal law superseded a clause in the Oregon State Constitution banning black suffrage. It would not be until 1959 that Oregon would ratify the Fifteenth .
From 1870 to 1885 anti-Chinese sentiment began to rise amongst Oregon citizens with labor and political leaders advocating for both the expulsion of Chinese residents and the exclusion of future Chinese from Oregon. In May 1873, the Portland city council passed a resolution encouraging contractors to not hire Chinese workers out of fear of losing future contracts due to Chinese workers of time typically working for low wages and then sending the funds to their families. This resolution was ultimately refused. In August of that same year, a fire at a Chinese laundry broke allegedly instigated by white "incendiaries" hoping to displace the Chinese population. In 1880, most Chinese men resided near Second and Oak Streets which was so segregated that no other ethnicity beside Chinese lived there.
Sometime during the mid-1880s, Portland's Chinatown saw two of its buildings burn down and Chinese woodcutter camps raided by eighty masked men. Rallies in support of the anti-Chinese club also took shape. In 1883 an attempt to remove the ban on black suffrage failed due in part to the clause being null and void by the Fifteenth Amendment's inclusion in the U.S. Constitution. Further attempts to remove the clause were made in 1895, 1916, and 1927 with the clause finally being removed in 1927.
In 1885, racial tensions were further exacerbated as about 500 Chinese residents were excluded from Tacoma, Washington, and sent to Portland. On February 22, 1886, a vote was held on the removal of the Chinese residents. Later that day a Chinese camp at Guild's Lake was attacked by Local workers in East Portland who also drove out between 100 and 200 Chinese workers. Despite the state constitution banning Chinese people from mining some still performed it and the next year a massacre was caused by a group of white men resulting in the deaths of 34 Chinese miners.
By 1890, 1,000 black people lived in Oregon with the number doubling by 1920. In 1893, the white citizens of La Grande burned down the city's Chinatown. This caused the residents of that area to become displaced with most leaving Oregon. Some however remained and attempt to resist the mob. They were ultimately forced to leave as well. That same year Baker City Mayor Charles Palmer called for the Baker City Chinatown to be overhauled to "sanitary and moral conditions", Palmer viewed the Chinese as "a class ... that a community cannot afford to harbor or tolerate". Around this time, "sundown towns" started to appear.
From 1900 to 1940 the Oregon Chinese population began to diminish due to laws such as the Page Act of 1875 and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. From 1940 to 1970 the number would increase. This was during the Exclusion era lasting from 1882–1943 which left Chinese communities isolated and discriminated against in fields such as housing, jobs, commercial opportunities, education, medical and social services.
In 1906, the legal case "Taylor v. Cohn" led to the Oregon Supreme Court sanctioning the right of white Americans to racially discriminate against blacks in theatres. In 1918, black soldiers from California saw a sign that read "We employ white help and cater to white trade only". Angered, the men proceeded to destroy the sign. A similar occurrence happened in 1943. In the early 20th century, Black railroad workers coming to Portland faced extreme segregation. In 1919, the Realty Board of Portland had approved a Code of Ethics forbidding realtors and bankers from selling or giving loans to minorities for properties located in white neighbourhoods. That same year a law making public discrimination illegal was proposed. The law would be passed in 1953. African Americans who did move to Portland in the early 20th century, mostly railroad workers, faced extreme segregation.
In the 1920s racially restrictive housing covenants came into prominence. These covenants allowed communities to be created that excluded certain ethnic and religious groups. These covenants came after widespread housing discrimination of past decades. These covenants were made unenforceable by the federal Civil Rights Act of 1968.
WWII and onwards: 1944–present.
During World War II the incentive of shipyard jobs caused a boom in the African American population. Portland's African American population grew from 2,565 in 1940 to 25,000 in 1944. With this, an increase in the racism that imbued the private industries and labour unions of the time followed. Due to union rules, black workers were prevented from doing specialized jobs such stevedores, truck drivers, and laundry workers and were instead relegated to doing common labour. After the war, racism continued for black residents. Jobs began to become lost due to white soldiers return and black residents were told to leave with Earl Riley, the mayor of Portland telling them they were not welcomed. In response groups protesting and resisting the racism and promoting equality began to emerge. These included the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Urban League, the Office of Vocational Opportunity, and the Committee on Inter-Racial Principles and Practices.
In 1951, the law prohibiting interracial marriages and insurance surcharges for non-white drivers were removed. By the early 1960s, Black people in Portland were barred from being served at white restaurants, going to the city funded swimming pools, and skating in ice rinks, with the exception of the day set aside for black people to skate. In the 1970s, multiple black men were killed by the police in Portland, and in the 1980s, the Portland Police Bureau was investigated after officers killed possums and placed them in front of black-owned restaurants.
In 1981, amid national unrest relating to the Atlanta murders of 1979–1981, two Portland police officers placed dead opossums outside the Burger Barn, a Black-owned restaurant. The officers were fired; the "Oregonian" Editorial Board supported the firing in a March 28 editorial which articulated the racial implications of the act. The two were later reinstated when an arbitrator deemed the firing excessive; the FBI investigated the matter for six months, but ultimately declined to bring charges. The police paid part of a settlement.
Ivancie removed the Police Bureau from the portfolio of City Commissioner Charles Jordan, then the only Black member of Portland City Council. The move sparked a protest, led by Ron Herndon. The Portland Internal Investigations Auditing Committee (PIIAC) was formed by City Council over the opposition of Mayor Frank Ivancie, who was closely tied with the Police Bureau, in response to the incident, in 1982. The police union organized a petition drive to bring the formation of the committee before voters, but voters approved the committee.
In 1985, two Portland police officers who had been caught distributing T-shirts with the slogan "Don't Choke 'Em, Smoke 'Em" were reinstated by an arbitrator after having been fired.
In the 1980s and 1990s, neo-Nazi skinheads protested in the streets and on November 13, 1988 Ethiopian student Mulugeta Seraw was killed by white supremacists. In the 1990s, Portland became infamous for its neo-Nazi group Volksfront. Years before neo-Nazi group White Aryan Resistance began to recruit members. Ciaran Mulloy, a union organiser and anti-fascist, recalled how "There were multiple gangs, and 300 Nazis in a city of 300,000" further stating that "The anti-racist youth were intimidated and isolated. The Nazis were just openly hanging out on the streets." In 1993, a racist skinhead named Eric Banks was shot dead by John Bair, a member of Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice.
On November 5, 2002, 70% of Oregon voted to remove obsolete and offensive language from the Oregon Constitution such as "negroes", "mulattoes", and "whites". In 2007, neo-Nazis attempted to gather in Portland for a three-day skinhead festival. In 2011 an audit, designed to find if that Black and Latino renters were unfairly disadvantaged in regards to the housing market, found that in 64% of the 50 tests done, discrimination took place. This discrimination violated local, state and federal housing laws; however, as of May 2011 no action had been taken against the landlords who discriminated. This audit came after a similar one in 2009 which found that landlords discriminated against Black renters in two-thirds of the tests in Ashland and 78% of the tests in Beaverton.
In 2017, a double murder was committed by white supremacist Jeremy Joseph Christian. On August 17, 2019, a rally was held by among others, members of the American Guard and "The Daily Stormer" who are white nationalists and neo-Nazis respectively according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.
In 2020, Oregon established a discriminatory fund in the form of the Oregon Cares Fund, which refused to hand out COVID-19 monetary relief to business owners if they were non-black. As of December 18, the fund was shut down due to the multiple lawsuits pending against it.
Albina.
In May 1948 the residents of Vanport, including its sizeable black population totalling over 6,300, would soon become displaced because of a flood that destroyed the city. Due to Albina being the only place where black people could purchase a house it soon becomes the dominant spot for black residents. As such it gained a reputation among white citizens as a "blighted slum in need of repair". In 1956, an arena was built displacing over 476 residents, half of whom were black. Further damage to black-owned properties would take place via the construction of the Veterans Memorial Coliseum and Interstate 5 in 1960 and the local hospital expansion in 1972 which would clear out 300 homes and businesses.
In the 1970s and 1980s, redlining and discrimination by the banks would affect the local black residents causing most to leave. This meant prime reinvestment. In 1988, when the majority of the houses were abandoned and the city terrorized by drugs and gang warfare. Business and house began to be bought up by white residents causing racial tensions to heighten as many black residents suffered due to their inability to pay the increased tax. By 1999, the black population of Albina owned 36% fewer homes than they had a decade earlier, while the white population owned 43% more. The displacement of black citizens in Albina continued in the early 2000s.
Resistance to displacement has taken place, such as in 2014 when a Trader Joe's was set to be built, possibly causing more displacement by further gentrifying the area. Resistance took place in the form of a letter written by the Portland African American Leadership Forum protesting its installation. Trader Joe's ultimately pulled out. The act of resistance was largely reported by conservative blogs to be one of racism and discrimination towards white people. This viewpoint was conversely critiqued.
Ku Klux Klan presence.
In the 1920s, Oregon had the largest Ku Klux Klan (KKK) membership per capita in the United States. On August 2, 1921, members of the KKK meet with Portland government officials to discuss the recent negative press against the KKK as well as the supposed collaboration of Klan members and city officials. Notably the meeting featured Fred L. Gifford, a former line superintendent for the Northwestern Electric Company.
Gifford was the grand dragon of the Oregon Ku Klux Klan from 1921 to 1924. Gifford's purpose within the Klan was to recruit new members and gain influence in government. Gifford succeeded in doing so, recruiting over thousands of members, including politicians, such as Kaspar K. Kubli, a state legislator and speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives. Gifford was later nominated as the candidate for the primary election for U.S. Senate, serving as the Oregon representative, which Gifford declined.
By 1921, Klan membership was steadily increasing due to them capitalising on the racism against minorities (particularly Chinese and Japanese), anti-Catholicism, and social morality. KKK member Walter M. Pierce was elected governor in 1922. Over 35,000 members were claimed by the Klan leaders to be active in 1923. By the mid 1920s the KKK's presence began to fade, leading to most klaverns in the area to be non-existent by the end of the 1930s.
Legacy and modern solutions.
According to Matt Novak of media outlet Gizmodo, Oregon "today still exists as a white utopia in some respects". Due to "Nearly two centuries of exclusion, violence and intimidation", Portland is among the whitest major cities in the United States. In 2019 the population was nearly 87% white (excluding Hispanic or Latino demographics, the number becomes 75%). In 2016 around 38,000 African Americans lived in Portland with over 10,000 of them having to move to the outskirts from the city due to gentrification. In Portland the gentrification of the historically black neighborhood Albina has caused conflict between long-time black residents and new white residents. Wider gentrification has displaced many black residents in north and northeast Portland. A blog entitled "Shit White People Say to Black and Brown Folks in PDX [Portland]", which details people of color's encounters with white citizens, once claimed that "Most of the people who live here in Portland have never had to directly, physically and/or emotionally interact with PoC [people of color] in their life cycle." According to Walidah Imarisha and James Loewen, sundown towns still have a strong presence within Oregon.
A 2014 report by the Portland State University and the Coalition of Communities found that not only do black families fall far behind white families in Portland in regards to employment, health outcomes, and high-school graduation rates, but that in 2010 only 32% of African Americans in Multnomah County owned houses, which was 13% lower than the national average for African Americans and 28% lower than White Americans in the same county. Also that year almost two-thirds of black single mothers in Multnomah County with children under five lived in poverty which was higher than the average for the rest of nation, being over half. Just the year before White Americans in Multnomah County made around $70,000 while African Americans made around $34,000, which is $8,000 below the national average. Overall the report concluded that "Oregon has been slow to dismantle overtly racist policies", and so African Americans in Multnomah County suffer as a result and have to deal with the lasting effects of "racialized policies, practices, and decision-making". The Portland African American population were also found to be disproportionately affected by crime, accounting for 45% of the city's homicide victims and 27% of its jail population. African American children in Portland were also found to be expelled the most from school, starting from Kindergarten. Native American children were the next highest.
While Oregon was overt with its racist laws, the laws themselves were not too different from those formed elsewhere in the nation:
She also stated that racist practises of the past are "not only alive" but serve as "the foundation for the institutions of Oregon", and that "Portland has, in many ways, perfected neoliberal racism". Imarisha has also commented on how at events she does around Oregon on the history of black inhabitants, Neo-Nazis have frequently harassed her with "sexually explicit comments" and death threats.
Hoping to dispel racism within Oregon, actions such as police reform have been flaunted. Governor Kate Brown in particular has passed juvenile justice reforms and has worked to reduce harsh prison sentences and reinvest in crime prevention and drug rehabilitation. In 2020, during the George Floyd protests she partook in community listening sessions with Black organizers on the matter of meaningful social change. Brown intends to implement reforms suggested by the People of Color Caucus at the aforementioned hearings.
In an attempt to catalogue and remove racially restrictive housing covenants graduate student, Greta Smith has begun to create a database of said covenants alongside a map of where people of color were excluded from. Government officials have also allowed homeowners to request the removal of racist language in home covenants.
In 2012, intending to make amends with those displaced by the expansion to Legacy Emanuel Hospital, several events have been held such as breakfasts and hearings dedicated to the previous residents. That same year an exhibit was erected "to honor the neighborhood's history and accept the hospital's role in devastating it". The hospital also made a promise that the such an act will never be repeated. Some people, such as Lolenzo Poe, Portland Public Schools' chief equity and diversity officer criticised the actions by the hospital as ineffective. Some, however, praised the hospital for being the first institution to acknowledge the pain felt by those affected. In other attempts to fix racial bias, Emanuel has worked with minority contractors and actively hired minority workers to better the "racial makeup" of its staff.
In 2017, CBSN presented the documentary film "Portland: Race Against the Past", which focused on racism in Portland.

Philip's daughters

Philip's daughters are four women briefly mentioned in the Bible. 
Biblical account.
They were daughters of Philip the Evangelist, one of the seven Greek-speaking Jewish men, including Stephen who were appointed deacons to the Greek-speaking Jewish widows in the Jerusalem church. He became an evangelist travelling throughout the Holy Land. By the end of account in Acts he was living in Caesarea Maritima where he had four daughters. 
The Bible tells us only that The next day we left and came to Caesarea; and we went into the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the seven, and stayed with him. 9 He had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy.
Extra-biblical references.
Further details of these women are given in various early histories including Eusebius and Papius. It is possible that they were informants for both Luke in their youth and the early Christian historian Papias in their latter years.
Eusebius quoting Papias tells us that two daughters remained with Philip in his old age, when he had moved to the Phrygian city of Hierapolis and even relates a tale where one was miraculously raised from the dead.” Eusebius' source for these tales was Papias, who he extensively quoted, and who was a young Bishop of Hierapolis. It is plausible that Papias knew these women. 
Eusebius held the women as examples of the right living and refers to them as “great lights” or “mighty luminaries” People would travel long distances to consult them.
A later Greek Menaon, an annual calendar equivalent to a Catholic missal, which preserves the memory of martyrs and saints, claims that two of the daughters were called Hermione and Eutychis. 
Hermione and her sister Eutychis travelled to Ephesus. An early "vita" of Hermione also survives, and recounts much of her life.
Burial place.
Tradition says that two daughters, Irais and Chariline, were buried in Hierapolis. Eusebius writes “After him there were four prophetesses, the daughters of Philip, at Hierapolis in Asia. Their tomb is there and the tomb of their father.”
Other sources however, say all four were buried in Caesarea.

<doc id="56781773" url="?curid=56781773" title="Cotula alpina">
Cotula alpina

Cotula alpina, also known as the alpine cotula, is a perennial herb in the family Asteraceae. It is a small flowering plant that forms ground covering mats and is well adapted to alpine environments.
Description.
Alpine cotula has flat glabrous light-green leaves that are pinnately divided almost to the midrib. It forms a large number of rosettes which lie just above ground level while the leaves are hairless and between 1–3 cm in length and 5–10 mm wide. They are slow growing plants and are often stoloniferous. It can be easily confused with "Leptinella filicula" which has similar looking leaves and is also part of the family Asteraceae.
Flowering occurs from spring through to summer. Each rosette produces a single yellow to cream flower, about 7 mm in diameter. They are at the top of erect stalks that are generally shorter than the leaves but extend further when fruiting. A unique characteristic of "C. alpina" is that the flower-bearing stalks are hollow.
Distribution and habitat.
"Cotula alpina" is found in heath, short herbfield and tussock grasslands in alpine and sub-alpine areas. It is common in the Central Plateau and Midlands of Tasmania and can also be found at high altitudes in Victoria and New South Wales.
The herb can survive in shade to full sun and requires high moisture levels for growth. It can also tolerate clay, loam and sandy soil types and is phosphorus intolerant. It can survive through exposed environmental conditions including high winds and low temperatures including snow and frosts. It has been reported to show grazing resistance.
Seed and germination.
"Cotula aplina" has achenes, which are hard, dry fruit which contain a single seed. As the seed matures, the achenes loosen towards the top and develops a fluffy appearance. The seeds are 1.5–2 mm long, compressed laterally and germination can occur after 2 to 4 weeks.

Betoño Sports Complex

The Betoño Sports Complex (, ), also known as El Glorioso, is a football training ground and match venue located in the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, Álava (Basque Country).
Facilities.
The complex is situated to the east of Vitoria city centre, adjacent to the village of the same name and close to the Salburua wetlands reserve. As of 2018, the facilities for 11-a-side football consisted of three full-size grass pitches (one with a basic covered and seated stand for around 188 spectators) and one artificial turf pitch, and associated changing areas.
History of the site.
The 17,000m² complex was originally the recreation grounds of the Michelin tyre company who have a large factory in the area; their other factory in Lasarte-Oria had a which reached the Spanish third tier in the 1970s.
The facilities were used extensively by Deportivo Alavés for many years before being purchased by the club, upgraded and renamed "El Glorioso" ('The Glorious', referencing one of their nicknames) in 2001. Betoño became the home ground for the Alavés B-team and C-team who at that time were competing in the third and fourth tiers of the Spanish football league system. However, the club's fortunes declined rapidly under the ownership of Dmitry Piterman, with the senior team falling to the third level, the B-team to the fifth and the C-team disbanding, and in 2006 Vitoria-Gasteiz city council reacquired control of the facility.
Since then, many smaller teams have trained regularly or played their home fixtures there, including , Gasteizko Neskak (a women's club whose senior squad was merged into a new Alavés female team in 2017) and, until 2015, CD Vitoria. As of 2016–17, the various age group teams of Alavés have been holding training sessions at Betoño, having secured a deal for the exclusive use of one of the pitches, although the club also has a dedicated training facility of a similar size, Ciudad Deportiva José Luis Compañón (also known by its location, 'Ibaia'), to the south-west of the city.
Future developments.
Since becoming owner of Alavés in 2013, Josean Querejeta forged close links between the football club and his basketball team Saski Baskonia including a joint training initiative for children ("5+11 Foundation"). He also stated his desire for Alavés to have an elite training facility, and this became a more urgent concern when the team were promoted to La Liga in 2016. The proximity of the Betoño grounds to Baskonia's :Fernando Buesa Arena and "BAKH" multi-sports centre led to it being the preferred site to be developed, ahead of Ibaia which has only basic facilities and is located at an isolated site on the other side of the city. However, if Alavés were to take back full exclusive control of Betoño, the local teams based there would be without a home ground close to them. The higher land value of Betoño and its importance to amateur football in the city were considerable obstacles in the club's proposals to re-acquire ownership of the complex.
As part of a wider project involving a €50 million investment in the Alavés infrastructure and stadium jointly financed between the club and public bodies, in summer 2017 an agreement in principle over the purchase of Betoño, involving an annual fee to the city until 2020 when a land purchase fee of €6 million would be paid, accompanied by a proposal for the local teams to have use of Ibaia for their matches, appeared to have been reached in summer 2017, but some months later this became less certain when the price of the land involved, including the former Michelin factory adjacent to the sports complex, was set at €16 million by the city council, prompting Alavés to release an alternative plan to purchase farmland to the east of the Buesa Arena, outside the city limits of Vitoria-Gasteiz.

Battle of Landing Zone Center

The Battle of Landing Zone Center (also known as the Battle of Hill 352 or the Battle of Nui Hoac Ridge) took place from 5–25 May 1968 in Quảng Tín Province during the Vietnam War.
Background.
During the Tet Offensive of 1968, the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 2nd Division tried to capture Đà Nẵng but they were defeated in the Battle of Lo Giang. PAVN General Chu Huy Mân Commander of Military Region 5 ordered General Giáp Văn Cương, commander of the 2nd Division, to split the Division into two fighting arms: one regiment would tie down the Americans in the Quế Son Valley, while the rest of the Division would withdraw to their base areas near Laos, to link up with the 70th Transport Regiment and rest and refit. Then, their next target would be Khâm Đức, the last remaining Special Forces camp adjacent to the Ho Chi Minh Trail in I Corps. Mân told his senior officers that they would attack Khâm Đức to force an American retreat from the area.
In the aftermath of the battle for Đà Nẵng, U.S. military commanders in I Corps held different views on the fighting ability of the PAVN 2nd Division. Americal Division commander Major-General Samuel W. Koster claimed losses sustained by the Division had "impaired its future effectiveness", after his units killed more than 1,000 enemy soldiers in the month of January alone. In contrast, 1st Marine Division commander Major-General Donn J. Robertson told his superiors that the 2nd Division may have several uncommitted units they could deploy for future operations.
Battle.
Landing Zone Center () was located on Hill 348, approximately 20km northwest of Tam Kỳ. In early May 1968 it was occupied by 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment and Battery B, 3rd Battalion, 82nd Artillery Regiment.
On 5 May as part of the May Offensive, the PAVN 31st Regiment attacked LZ Center with mortars and recoilless rifles. When U.S. helicopters tried to land a patrol to locate those weapons, a heavy machine gun company from the PAVN K31 Anti-Aircraft Battalion opened fire from positions around the firebase, shooting down UH-1D #66-17075 from the 178th Assault Helicopter Company which crashed killing all 10 crew and passengers and shortly afterwards a helicopter gunship of the 71st Assault Helicopter Company was also shot down. Company D 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment was flown in to reinforce LZ Center. On 7 May an A–1E Skyraider was shot down while providing air support near LZ Center. 
On 8 May MG Koster ordered the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment and the 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment to sweep the hills around Landing Zone Center.
The PAVN forces were concentrated on the Nui Hoac Ridge, with their main position located on Hill 352 () approximately 2.5km south of LZ Center. This position held at least 2 anti-aircraft guns, recoilless rifles, mortars and an unknown number of PAVN. In addition the PAVN were entrenched between Hills 434 and 479 to the east of LZ Center. 
On 14 May 1968 during an attack on PAVN bunkers on Hill 352 Platoon sergeant Finnis D. McCleery of 1st Platoon, Company A, 1/6th Infantry single-handedly attacked and destroyed several PAVN bunkers despite being wounded twice. For his actions that day, McCleery would be awarded the Medal of Honor.
Aftermath.
The battle was a U.S. victory with the US claiming over 365 PAVN were killed, however it diverted U.S. resources away from the Battle of Kham Duc.

Mesopotamian myths

Mesopotamian mythology refers to the myths, religious texts, and other literature that comes from the region of ancient Mesopotamia which is a historical region of Western Asia, situated within the Tigris–Euphrates river system that occupies the area of present-day Iraq. In particular the societies of Sumer, Akkad, and Assyria, all of which existed shortly after 3000 BCE and were mostly gone by 400 CE. These works were primarily preserved on stone or clay tablets and were written in cuneiform by scribes. Several lengthy pieces have survived, some of which are considered the oldest stories in the world, and have given historians insight into Mesopotamian ideology and cosmology.
Creation myths.
There are many different accounts of the creation of the earth from the Mesopotamian region. This is because of the many different cultures in the area and the shifts in narratives that are common in ancient cultures due to their reliance on word of mouth to transmit stories. These myths can share related themes, but the chronology of events vary based on when or where the story was written down.
Atra-Hasis.
Atra-Hasis refers both to one of the Mesopotamian myths focusing on the earth’s creation, and also the main character of that myth. The myth possibly has Assyrian roots, as a fragmented version may have been found in the library of Ashusbanipal, though translations remain unsure. Its most complete surviving version was recorded in Akkadian. The myth begins with humans being created by the mother goddess Mami to lighten the gods' workload. She made them out of a mixture of clay, flesh, and blood from a slain god. Later in the story though, the god Enlil attempts to control overpopulation of humans through various methods, including famine, drought, and finally, a great flood. Humankind is saved by Atrahasis, who was warned of the flood by the god Enki and built a boat to escape the waters, eventually placating the gods with sacrifices.
Eridu Genesis.
Eridu Genesis has a similar plot to that of the Akkadian myth, Atra-Hasis, though it is harder to tell what happens exactly in Eridu Genesis because the tablet upon which it was recorded is badly damaged. The two stories share the flood as the major event however, although the hero who survives in Eridu Genesis is called Zi-ud-sura instead of Artahasis. Eridu Genesis was recorded around the same time as Atra-Hasis, however the fragmented tablet that held it was found in Nippur, located in modern-day east Iraq, while the version of Atra-hasis that came from the same time was found in the library of Ashurbanipal, in modern-day north Iraq.
Enuma Elish.
Enuma Elis (also spelled Enuma Elish) is a Babylonian creation myth with an unclear composition, though it possibly dates back to the Bronze Age. This piece was thought to be recited in a ritual celebration of the Babylonian new year. It chronicles the birth of the gods, the world, and man, whose purpose was to serve the gods and lighten their work load. The focus of the narrative is on praising Marduk, the patron god of Babylon, who creates the world, the calendar, and humanity.
Heroic epics.
These stories tended to focus on a great hero, following their journey through trials or simply important events in their life. Stories like these can be found in many different cultures around the world, and often give insight into the values of those societies. For example, in a culture that celebrated a hero that was devout to the gods or respecting their father, it can be inferred that the society valued those traits.
Epic of Gilgamesh.
The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the most well known Mesopotamian myths, and is often regarded as the oldest known piece of literature in the world. It was initially a number of individual short stories, and was not combined into one cohesive epic until the 18th century. The story follows the Sumerian king Gilgamesh, typically regarded as a historical figure, and his good friend, Enkidu through various adventures and quests that eventually lead to Enkidu's death. The second half of the epic deal with Gilgamesh, distressed about the death of his friend and his own impending mortality, as he searches for immortality. In the end he fails, but he comes to terms with the fact that he is eventually going to die and returns to his city of Uruk a wiser king.
The Myth of Adapa.
The earliest record of myth of Adapa is from the 14th century BC. Adapa was a Sumerian citizen who was blessed by the god Enki with immeasurable intelligence. However, one day Adapa was knocked into the sea by the south wind, and in a rage he broke the south wind’s wings so that it could no longer blow. Adapa was summoned to be judged by An, and before he left Enki warned him not to eat or drink anything offered to him. However, An had a change of heart when he realized just how smart Adapa was, and offered him the food of immortality, which Adapa, dutiful to Enki, turned down. This story is used as an explanation for humankind’s mortality, it is associated with the fall of man narrative that is also present in Christianity.
Common themes.
Immortality is a constant goal of the characters in Mesopotamian epics. No matter the version of the story, the man who survives the flood, whether Atrahasis, Zi-ud-sura, or Utnapishtim, is granted immortality by the gods. This character then makes a reappearance in the Epic of Gilgamesh, when Gilgamesh is searching for immortality after coming to fear death and the underworld after hearing stories from his friend, Enkidu, about what awaits humanity after death. Enkidu says:On entering the House of Dust,everywhere I looked there were royal crowns gathered in heaps,everywhere I listened, it was the bearers of crowns,who, in the past, had ruled the land,but who now served Anu and Enlil cooked meats,served confections, and poured cool water from waterskins.Upon hearing that his position in life did not matter in the underworld, Gilgamesh is terrified and seeks out Utnapishtim, who has achieved immortality after surviving the flood sent by the gods to wipe out humanity. Immortality is also touched on in the myth of Adapa. Adapa’s accidental refusal to eat the food of immortality offered to him by the gods is used as an explanation for the fact that humans die.
Also common in Mesopotamian myths is the reoccurring concept that humanity’s purpose is to serve the gods. In all of the creation myths, humans are only made by the gods in order to help in the fields or offer sacrifices. When they get to be too numerous, loud, or otherwise bothersome, the gods attempt to control the population through plagues, droughts, and most famously, the great flood. This disregard for human life emphasizes the hierarchy that existed in the Mesopotamian consciousness, with humans existing as subjects to the will of the gods.
Sources.
Modern understanding of Mesopotamian mythology has been provided through archeological excavations of West Asia and the recovery of many stone and clay tablets, some of which contained the records of many myths. There have been different versions of each myth found in various locations across the region, with inconsistencies between each but maintaining overall common themes and narratives. These versions were written in different languages, including Akkadian, Sumerian, and Old Babylonian, and were often translated from one to another, leading to further inconsistencies due to the inherently imperfect nature of these translations.

Benjamin Elton Cox

Benjamin Elton Cox (June 19, 1931 – June 12, 2011) was an American civil rights movement activist and preacher. Cox participated in the 1960s Freedom Riders protest was interviewed in the film of the same name, released in 2010.
Personal life and education.
Cox was a native of Whiteville, Tennessee. He was a popular preacher in the area and received the name "Beltin' Elton" during the course of his freedom rides.
Cox was the seventh born of his parents' sixteen children. Cox later moved to Kankakee, Illinois at the age of five.
He did not complete high school, rather he worked for 18 months cleaning shoes to support his family financially. Later in 1950 he was able to get his diploma from Joliet Township High School at the age of twenty. He later went on to attend Livingstone College, an A.M.E. Zion institution in the city of Salisbury, North Carolina. He completed his time in Livingstone College in 1954 after getting a major in sociology and a minor in history. After his time at Livingstone College, he studied a divinity degree at Howard, and spent a year as a visiting student at a seminary in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Preaching and the civil rights movement.
After his ordination in 1958, he became a pastor of Pilgrim Congregational Church in High Point, North Carolina.
Cox quickly gained a reputation for being a strong supporter of the civil rights movement. He started desegregation efforts in local schools, serving as an advisor for NAACP Youth Council, and participating as an observer for the American Friends Service Committee.
After the Greensboro sit-ins in February 1960, he encouraged local students to participate in their own sit-ins, under the condition they stay non-violent.
Cox views on being non-violent were very strong. He soon caught the attention of the national NAACP leaders, including James Farmer. Farmer hired Cox to help stump the south.
Shortly after Farmer hired Cox, Farmer became executive director of CORE. Cox soon received a call from Farmer, wanting to know if Cox would be willing to join the Freedom Rides due to his background as being an ordained minister. Cox agreed and showed up in Washington wearing formal clothing, in case anyone was questioning if the Ride lacked divine guidance.
Cox was one of one of the two ordained ministers, the other being J. Metz Rollins from Nashville. Rollins soon had to bow out leaving Cox as the only preacher and John Lewis as the sole representative of the Nashville movement.
To parallel the efforts of CORE field secretaries, Cox traveled across the South during the Spring and Summer of 1960. Cox was spreading the gospel of nonviolence to students. Many student activists were accepting of the message. Despite the many instances of white supremacists provoking violence, the sit-ins continued without a violent race war that many predicted would occur. 
In the summer of 1961, he participated in the CORE Freedom Ride from Missouri to Louisiana on July 8-15 1961. He defended his actions in the Freedom Ride by stating in the film "Freedom Riders", "If men like Governor Patterson [of Alabama] and Governor Barnett of Mississippi... would carry out the good oath of their office, then people would be able to travel in this country. Then people in Tel Aviv and Moscow and London would not pick up their newspaper for breakfast and realize that America is not living up to the dream of liberty and justice for all."
In December 1961, Cox was arrested in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and convicted of disturbing the peace. That conviction was appealed and upheld by the Louisiana Supreme Court, but overturned by the Supreme Court in Cox v. Louisiana. The Supreme Court held that state government cannot employ "breach of the peace" statutes against protesters engaging in peaceable demonstrations that may potentially incite violence.
Cox was arrested seventeen times over the course of a few decades. 
Later life.
Prior to retirement, he served as minister for Pilgrim Congregational Church in High Point, North Carolina. He later worked as chaplain at the VA Hospital in Urbana, Illinois, and finally, as a middle school counselor in Jackson, Tennessee.

GKM variety

In algebraic geometry, a GKM variety is a complex algebraic variety equipped with a torus action that meets certain conditions. The concept was introduced by Mark Goresky, Robert Kottwitz, and Robert MacPherson in 1998. The torus action of a GKM variety must be "skeletal": both the set of fixed points of the action, and the number of one-dimensional orbits of the action, must be finite. In addition, the action must be "equivariantly formal", a condition that can be phrased in terms of the torus' rational cohomology.

The Ciudad Deportiva José Luis Compañón ("José Luis Compañón Sport City" / ), also known as Instalaciones de Ibaia ("Ibaia Facilities" / ) after the name of its semi-rural location, is the primary training ground of Spanish professional football club Deportivo Alavés, located in the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, Álava (Basque Country).
Facilities.
The complex is in the district on the south-western edge of the Vitoria-Gasteiz urban area, about 3 km west of the club's Mendizorrotza stadium. As of 2018, the facilities consisted of three full-size grass pitches and one with artificial turf, with associated changing areas and a small gymnasium.
One of these pitches is utilised as the home stadium of the club's reserve team, Alavés B, who usually play in the Tercera División (fourth tier of the Spanish football league system). The club's women's team and academy teams also usually play their fixtures at Ibaia.
In 2018, Alavés offered use of Ibaia facilities to local affiliated team San Ignacio for matches after they were promoted to the Tercera División, due to the Federation being concerned with the condition of the playing surface at the latter's usual ground Adurtzabal.
History of the site.
The Ibaia complex was constructed in the 1980s on land owned by the club president Juan Arregui and was modernised in 2002 during a period of success for the club, at which time the complex was renamed in memory of José Luis Compañón, a popular and long-serving Alavés director who had recently died.
In spite of grand plans to add a roof over the pitches or build a golf gourse and hotel, little additional investment was made in the training facility over the next decade which was a time of sporting and financial upheaval for the club under the chaotic stewardship of Dmitry Piterman. Complications over ownership of a section of the land (one of the football pitches and the car park) led to that portion of the complex lying unused for several years due to the costs involved, which caused problems regarding access for vehicles and space for the players to train. The dispute was eventually resolved in 2011 when a new board took over.
Other training sites.
Alavés have close connections with the Betoño Sports Complex (also known as "El Glorioso") in the east of the city, and owned the site between 2001 and 2006.
The club can also make use of the municipality-owned "Olaranbe" facilities on the south-eastern outskirts of the city which are home to CD Aurrerá de Vitoria as well as CD Vitoria, the affiliated team of rivals SD Eibar, who previously played at Betoño. Alavés made an unsuccessful attempt to purchase Olaranbe in 2017.
Future developments.
Since becoming owner of Alavés in 2013, Josean Querejeta forged close links between the football club and his basketball team Saski Baskonia including a joint training initiative for children ("5+11 Foundation"). He also stated his desire for Alavés to have an elite training facility, and this became a more urgent concern when the team were promoted to La Liga in 2016. The proximity of the Betoño grounds to Baskonia's :Fernando Buesa Arena and "BAKH" multi-sports centre led to it being the preferred site to be developed, ahead of Ibaia which has only basic facilities and is located at an isolated site on the other side of the city.
In summer 2017 an agreement in principle over the purchase of Betoño, involving an annual fee to the city until 2020 when a land purchase fee of €6 million would be paid, accompanied by a proposal for the local teams to have use of Ibaia for their matches, appeared to have been reached in summer 2017, but some months later this became less certain when the price of the land involved, including the former Michelin factory adjacent to the sports complex, was set at €16 million by the city council.

Mega (Blank Banshee album)

Mega, (stylized MEGA) is the third studio album by Canadian musician and producer Blank Banshee. It was released via Bandcamp on October 10, 2016.
Background and composition.
In late 2014 a new project was announced by Blank Banshee via social media. Tracks from "MEGA" began appearing in live sets as early as July 2015.
By late 2016 an untitled song (later "Frozen Flame") had appeared on Blank Banshee's official website. A Twitter account associated with Blank Banshee initiated an ARG style promotional campaign involving an e-mail address that responded to fans via auto-reply with daily cryptic 'fragments' of a short story concluding on the eve of "MEGA"’s release. The story "'Zero-Day"', makes reference to several song titles and themes presented on "MEGA".
"MEGA" was composed using an Akai MPD26 and live instrumentation. It has been described as a “balance of abstract ambience and dance-able trap”. A continuation and expansion of Blank Banshee's signature sound, it is considerably more experimental, relying less on samples than its precursors. In a 2016 interview, Driscoll spoke of the link between his music and ‘virtual environments’, comparing his writing approach to that of 90's RPG music composers.
The album artwork was designed by Blank Banshee and features a 3D model of a meteor layered over a fuchsia gradient in reference to the cover art of Final Fantasy 7.
"MEGA" was produced, recorded and mastered in Vancouver, Canada.
Promotion and release.
In the spring of 2017, Blank Banshee embarked on The MEGA Tour, a 3 leg tour spanning Canada, Europe and America concluding in autumn of 2017.
"MEGA" has been released on Cassette Tape, Compact Disc, Vinyl and USB Flash Drive independently through the online store Hologram Bay.
Reception.
In an article posted after the release of "MEGA," "The Fader" makes note of Blank Banshee's cult following. "MEGA's" “fragmented-yet-soulful vaportrap bridges the yawning chasm between itself and "Blank Banshee 1"" notes Bandcamp daily. Online publication Pigeons and Planes called the album Blank Banshee's “best project yet”, praising its inventive use of samples and distinct textures.

Cha Gordo

Cha Gordo (literally "Fat Tea") is a culinary tradition amongst the Macanese community in Macau that is likened to high tea.
History.
Historically, families with Portuguese heritage in Macau would host a Cha Gordo for a number of occasions, including Catholic holidays, christening, or birthdays, but it can be held for any reason. Some families, historically, would even host one on a weekly basis.
A Cha Gordo would take place following a Macanese wedding, instead of the elaborate banquet seen in Chinese weddings.
Composition.
Cha Gordos are noted to be elaborate, consisting of 12 dishes or more. Cha Gordos typically start in the mid-afternoon, in order to allow the children to eat, and allow the adults to continue on with the entertainment, as the children go to bed.
Some of the dishes included in a Cha Gordo include Bolinhos de bacalhau, Minchi, Sopa de lacassá, and Tacho.
Present day.
Due to cramped living conditions in modern-day Macau, Cha Gordo has become a much rarer affair, but they have been held as community events on a regular basis (such as on Christmas), in an effort to preserve Macanese culture.

The franchise follow the adventures of the Angels, a team of women working for the Townsend Agency, a private secret agent agency, under the leadership of Charlie Townsend, their unseen boss.
The original television series enjoyed huge popularity with audiences and was a top ten hit in the Nielsen ratings for its first two seasons.

"Target" was a sister title to the long-running "TV Comic" aimed at older children and featuring TV action and crime shows of the day. Proving unpopular, it folded in August and merged back into "TV Comic" where Canning's Angels strip continued until October 1979. The second strip was printed in Junior TV Times "Look-in", debuting in November 1979 (as soon as Polystyle's deal expired), written by Angus Allan and drawn by Jim Baikie and Bill Titcombe.
In June 2018, a six-issue limited comic book series based on the television series was launched by Dynamite Entertainment. A crossover comic book series with "Charlie's Angels" and "The Bionic Woman" titled "Charlie's Angels vs. the Bionic Woman", was released on July 3, 2019.

So Nice is an album by saxophonist Houston Person which was recorded in 2011 and released on the HighNote label.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Ken Dryden states "Houston Person is a very versatile veteran tenor saxophonist who tends to get overlooked in critics' polls, yet his extensive musical resumé is ample proof that he is a jazz master. This 2011 session ranges from a duet to septet, with everyone playing compact solos, keeping all but one under the six-minute mark, a lost art in modern jazz. ... Highly recommended". On All About Jazz, Greg Simmons noted " Houston Person isn't breaking any new ground with "So Nice". He doesn't have to. He does what he does, and he does it really well".

Tacho (food)

Tacho (meaning "pot" or "pan"), also known as Chau-Chau Pele, is considered to be a Macanese variant of Cozido à portuguesa that is found in Portuguese cuisine.
History.
Tacho is considered to be a winter dish, and can take up to three days to prepare and make. It is often eaten during the holidays, and symbolizes familial unity.
At least one account states that Tacho began as a dish made with leftover ingredients from holiday feasts.
In the past, Tacho was seen as a dish consumed by wealthy people. It is considered to be a relatively rare dish, even in the present day.
Ingredients.
Even though there are variations depending on recipes, Tacho is, in general, noted to have swapped the Chouriços that is found in "Cozido" with Chinese sausage, and the turnips found in "Cozido" with Daikon. Some Tachos include Pork rind, Pig's trotters, and balichão. One recipe also calls for the use of fish maw.

Thlewiaza River

The Thlewiaza River is a river in Canada. Although some sources define the river as originating out of Nueltin Lake, according to the Canadian Geographical Names Database the river begins at Snyder Lake in northwestern Manitoba. From there the river flows northeast through Kasmere Lake into the southwest end of Nueltin Lake. It exits Nueltin Lake at its northern end in Nunavut and flows east through Edehon Lake and Ranger Seal Lake before emptying into Hudson Bay. Its drainage basin covers an area of .
The river's name in Chipewyan is "Łuazedes" (pronounced "thlu-assee-des"), meaning "little fish river", in reference to the plentiful grayling in its waters. It is known to the Inuit as the "big river" and used by them to travel inland where they trap arctic foxes and hunt caribou. A sighting of harbour seals at Edehon Lake has been documented and sightings further upstream at Nueltin Lake have also been reported.
The Thlewiaza was first mapped in 1912 by Ernest Oberholtzer and Billy Magee, an Ojibwe trapper. There are no permanent settlements in the area.

La Lega (cooperative)

La Lega Nazionale is an Italian co-operative association founded in 1891 on irredentist ideals. It grew out of The Federation of Italian Co-operatives, formed in 1886 with 248 co-ops representing 74,000 members. Following the 1992 Italian cooperative legal reform, which was lobbied for by La Lega, La Lega introduced capital participation in ownership by minority "soci sovventori", capital memberships, with restricted voting rights.
La Lega is Italy's largest umbrella group for collectives, promoting the interests of the cooperative sector at all levels of government. La Lega (or Legacoop) covers more than 17,000 cooperatives, including 5,000 worker co-ops, 3,000 agricultural co-ops, 2,000 consumer co-ops and 5,000 housing co-ops. By 2002, La Lega's total membership exceeded 6 million people, or slightly more than 10 percent of the Italian population. Of these members, 4.6 million belonged to La Lega's consumer co-ops.

Asplenium appendiculatum

Asplenium appendiculatum (formerly known as "Asplenium terrestre"), ground spleenwort, is a common native fern to Australia and New Zealand. It usually grows in cool damp conditions, among rocks, on logs or as an epiphyte.
Description.
"Asplenium appendiculatum " has foliage that is dark green, with blades that are 100-300 × 50–150 mm long, leathery and slightly drooping. Blade is lanceolate (slightly wider at a short distance above the base, tapering to a point at the tip) to oblong (tapering at the ends but about the same width throughout) in shape. Stipe (stalk below the blade) is 50–150 mm long is grooved, green above, brown below and scattered with narrow triangle scales. The rachis (stalk within the blade) is green, scaly and prominently ridged.
Pinnae (leaflets) are 8-20 alternate pairs, ranging from 30-100mm long × 5-30mm wide. Those at the base of the blade are ovate with those towards the tip, very narrowly ovate or elliptic. They are often long and relatively undivided tips. Stalks are covered with tiny scales on the underside. Pinnules at the base of the blade are narrowly elliptic and pinnate, up to 30 x 8mm. Pinnules towards the tip of the blade are linear, entire and sessile. Rhizomes (underground stems) are short and are covered with linear, tapering dark brown scales.
Each pinnule on a fertile frond has sori. They are sub marginal and 2-7mm, oblong in shape.
"Asplenium appendiculatum " is often confused with "Asplenium bulbiferum", however lacks bulbils (vegetative clones of the fern).
Taxonomy and Name.
Both the common and scientific name ‘spleenwort’ is derived from "Asplenium" species being used under the doctrine of signatures, to treat ailments of the spleen. This was belief was based on the spleen shaped sori. ‘Wort’ is an ancient English term that means ‘plant’. The species name "appendiculatum," is Latin for 'with appendages.
"Asplenium appendiculatum" was formerly known as "Asplenium terrestre,", meaning ground dwelling. This name was derived from its terrestrial growth habit in New Zealand, where It was discovered by P.J Brownsey in 1977. It was once thought to be endemic to New Zealand.
Taxonomy.
A global phylogeny of "Asplenium" published in 2020 divided the genus into eleven clades, which were given informal names pending further taxonomic study. "A. appendiculatum" belongs to the ""Neottopteris" clade", members of which generally have somewhat leathery leaf tissue. It forms a clade with "A. flaccidum" and "A. chathamense".
Habitat and distribution.
Tasmania.
In Tasmania "Asplenium appendiculatum " grows in wet sclerophyll forests, fern gullies and rocky outcrops on low mountain summits. It often grows as an epiphyte on Dicksonia antarctica and on logs and other tree species.
Victoria.
"Asplenium appendiculatum" is rare in Victoria. It has been observed in the Victoria Range, Mt Mueller and Wilsons Promontory.
New Zealand.
In New Zealand, "Asplenium appendiculatum " grows in lowland to subalpine forested areas, but is also found in bluffs and rocky outcrops in grey scrub.

Vias (rail company)

The Vias GmbH (stylized VIAS) is a rail service company based in Frankfurt (Germany). The name of the company was taken from the Latin word via for "way" and the letter "S" for service. It operates rail services in the states of Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia.
Owners.
The company was founded in 2005 by "Stadtwerke Verkehrsgesellschaft Frankfurt am Main" (VGF, the municipal transport company of Frankfurt) and Rurtalbahn GmbH (RTB) of Düren with both companies having equal shareholdings.
In March 2010, Danish State Railways announced that it had taken over VGF's shareholding with the help of its subsidiary "DSB Deutschland GmbH".
History.
On 22 October 2010, Düren-based "Vias DN2011 GmbH" was founded by its shareholders, "DSB Deutschland GmbH" and "R.A.T.H. GmbH" with the aim of providing rail services. This company was first registered as "Vias Odenwaldbahn GmbH" on 19 February 2014 and renamed "Vias Rail GmbH" on 22 June 2015. In the meantime R.A.T.H. GmbH had become its sole shareholder. On 13 December 2015, Vias Rail GmbH took over the public transport services on the Odenwald network from "Vias GmbH".
Rail services.
Lines in Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate.
Vias has operated the approximately 210-kilometre-long Odenwald Railway network on behalf of the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (RMV) and the state of Baden-Württemberg since 11 December 2005. It has also operated the East Rhine Railway since 12 December 2010 and the Pfungstadt Railway since 10 December 2011. It now operates on the following lines:
The designation of the lines corresponds to the numbering of the RMV.
Since the commencement of operations in the Odenwald, 22 brand new Bombardier Itino diesel railcars have been supplied by the "Fahrzeugmanagement Region Frankfurt RheinMain GmbH (fahma)" for the operations. The maintenance takes place in the workshop of "Odenwaldbahn-Infrastruktur GmbH" in Michelstadt, which is also the location of the operating centre. Four more sets of the same type were ordered by the RMV in August 2007 due to a lack of capacity and were delivered in the spring of 2010. These are also used on the Pfungstadt Railway, which was restored to operation from the 2011/2012 timetable change.
In addition, Vias also took over the "RheingauLinie" local service on the East Rhine Railway between Neuwied, Koblenz Hbf (and Stadtmitte), Wiesbaden Hbf and Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof (RMV line 10) at the 2010/2011 timetable change in December 2010. 5 three-car and 14 four-car FLIRT electric multiple units were ordered for its operation.
In December 2013, VIAS Rail GmbH won the tender for the operation of the Odenwald Railway and the Pfungstadt Railway. The new contract is valid from December 2015 for 12 years. The existing Itino sets will continue to be used, although adjustments to capacity have been made for some journeys. At least one train conductor is present in addition to the driver for all journeys.
Lines in North Rhine-Westphalia.
On 26 March 2015, the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr and "Nahverkehr Rheinland" (Rhineland local transport association) announced that Vias would operate the North Rhine-Westphalia Regionalbahn services RB 34 ("Schwalm-Nette-Bahn" from Mönchengladbach to Dalheim) and the northern part of the RB 38 service (the "Erft-Bahn" from Düsseldorf via Grevenbroich to Bedburg) from the timetable change on 10 December 2017. The RB 38 would no longer use its whole former route from the timetable change; instead passengers would have to change in Bedburg. The northern part is operated by Vias and has been renamed the RB 39. The transport association for the Rhineland ("Nahverkehr Rheinland"—Rhineland local transport) plans to electrify the southern (Bedburg-Cologne) section and operate it as an S-Bahn service, while the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr, which is the transport authority that administers the northern section of the route has rejected the electrification of the line for "transport and economic reasons." Twelve new Alstom Coradia LINT sets (nine LINT 54H and threeLINT 41H) are operated on the two lines. The contract for operating the service was signed with the new operator Vias for twelve years on 16 April 2015.
Thus, Vias GmbH has operated on the following lines in NRW since the timetable change in December 2017:

Abao

Zhang Shaochun (), known professionally as Abao (), is a Chinese folk singer from Shanxi. He first came to prominence as the winner of the CCTV talent contest "Xingguang Dadao" ('Star Road') in 2005, and became one of the best-known folk singers form the northwest of China.
Early life.
Abao was born in the outskirts of Datong, Shanxi on 27 February 1969. He began singing when he was four, influenced by a local folk singer although he had no formal training. Apart from Shanxi folk songs, he also learned to sing other folk songs, including songs of Shaanbei from neighbouring Shaanxi. He enrolled at Datong Arts School when he was twelve, and graduated in 1986.
Career.
After graduating, at the age of 17, he began to sing in a music bar in Datong, later joining a travelling troupe, singing at weddings and other occasions in villages around the country. He sang in a variety of genre including pop, rock and folk.
In 2004, Abao was performing in Beijing when he was spotted by a producer of a TV show. He was placed in folk-singing competition "Xibu Mingge Diansi Dasai" ( 西部民歌电视大赛) organized by CCTV, for which he received a bronze prize. Following his appearance on the show, he released a CD, self-titled "Abao". He then entered the first season of the singing contest "Xingguang Dadao". In the final in 2005, he performed "The Wild Lilies Bloom a Brilliant Red" (山丹丹开花红艳艳, "Shandandan kaihua hongyanyan"), and won the contest, beating the duo Phoenix Legend.
After winning the title, Abao performed regularly on television for many years, including the 2006 "CCTV New Year's Gala". He released his second album in 2006. He has also appeared as a judge on various television shows, including "Xingguang Dadao". In 2013, Abao participated in the Chinese reality television show "Splash!".
Performance style.
Abao has a wide vocal range, and sings in a distinctive high-pitched voice. His style of singing is a mix of folk styles of Shanxi, Mongolia, and in particular the "Xintianyou" style of Shaanxi. Abao typically performs dressed as a peasant from Shaanxi, wearing a sheepskin jerkin with black pants, and a white towel knotted on his head.
Although he is not from northern Shaanxi but neighbouring Shanxi, he became best known for the "Xintianyou" style of folk songs of Shaanxi, and was called the ""Xintianyo" Song King" (信天游歌王, "xintianyou gewang"). However, he has been criticised by folk song experts for not being authentic in his vocal technique and style. Nevertheless, his popularity changed the flavours of those folk songs performed by other folk singers, a process described as the "Abao phenomenon" by a scholar.

The design of the GT 4-Door Coupé was mainly influenced by the Mercedes-Benz AMG GT Concept introduced a few years before series production. The AMG GT 4-Door Coupé uses a front-engine layout with rear-wheel-drive or 4MATIC+ fully variable all-wheel-drive (rear-biased), and is available with either a 3.0 L "M256" turbo/supercharged inline-six engine or a 4.0 L "M177" twin-turbocharged V8 engine. The inline-six engine features a conventional turbocharger as well as a mild hybrid system that Mercedes-Benz calls "EQ Boost", which uses an electrically driven supercharger and a 48 volt electric motor that when combined, produce an extra and of torque in addition to the petrol engine when it is not powering the electrical system. This system traces its roots back to the Mercedes CLS53. The car utilises the rear anti-roll bar to increase chassis stiffness, as well as active aero, including an electronically adjustable rear spoiler and electronically operated front louvers in the front grille, that can open and close to manage airflow through the radiator from the AMG GT R flagship sports car.

<doc id="56782535" url="?curid=56782535" title="Michiko Kanba">
Michiko Kanba

 was a Japanese communist, University of Tokyo undergraduate, and a Zengakuren activist. She died in clashes between demonstrators and police at the South Gate of the National Diet Building in central Tokyo at the climax of the 1960 Anpo Protests against the US-Japan Security Treaty. She is buried in Tama Cemetery in Tokyo.
Activism and writing.
Michiko Kanba was born in Tokyo. Her father was Toshio Kanba, a sociologist and professor at Chuo University.
Kanba was raised in a middle-class Christian household, and entered University of Tokyo in 1957 and joined the Japan Communist Party on November of that year. After that, she became a leader in the New Left organization "The Bund" and participated in the massive Anpo Protests against the revisions of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan.
Kanba was one of the 76 student activists who were arrested at a January 26, 1960 sit-in at Haneda Airport. She also participated in protests around the Diet Building. She was killed just inside the South Gate of the National Diet Building after a group of students broke into the gate and clashed with riot police. An autopsy later determined that she died from chest compression and intracranial bleeding. Police claim that she was knocked down and trampled to death, while students blamed her death on physical assaults by police officers.
After her death, Kanba's personal writings and political essays were collected and published under the title "The Smile Nobody Knows" (Japanese: 人しれず微笑もん). In her writings, she discusses her life and activism.
Legacy.
Kanba's death was widely covered at the time, and is seen as a symbol of the 1960 mass protests against the revised Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan. A political cartoon that ran in the popular journal "Sekai" a month after Kanba's death depicted a yakuza gangster lighting a cigarette for a policeman as they both stand over her dead body in front of the National Diet Building. 
Historian Nick Kapur argues that nationwide shock at Kanba's death helped force the resignation of Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and the cancellation of a planned visit to Japan by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Kapur says Kanba's death was viewed as a "triple tragedy," first because she was so young, second because she was a student at Japan's most elite university, and third, because she was a woman, at a time when it was still novel for women to participate on the front lines of street protests. Eiji Oguma has contended that Kanba's death evoked recent memories of the many young people who lost their lives in World War II. Hiroko Hirakawa framed Kanba's posthumous status as a "maiden martyr" as reflecting contemporary expectations about middle-class femininity and motherhood. Chelsea Szendi Schieder argues that the global 1960s began in Japan with Kanba's death.
Photographer Hiroshi Hamaya captured the events of the night Kanba was killed.
Akiko Esashi wrote a biography in Japanese on Kanba in 2010, under the title "Michiko Kanba: Legend of a Sacred Girl" (Japanese: 樺美智子ー聖少女伝説).

Yerevan state Azerbaijan dramatic theater

Yerevan Azeri drama theater named after Jafar Jabbarly (Cəfər Cabbarlı adına İrəvan Dövlət Azərbaycan Dram Teatrı) is the Azerbaijan State Drama Theater, launched in Yerevan in 1928.
Historical overview.
In the early years (1880-1882) of the theater, performances were presented by amateur actors in Yerevan. French traveller Jean Chardin also indicated his thoughts in his writings, when he visited Yerevan at the end of the seventh century. During his travel he watched the show presented by male actors and dancers there. In 1882, the plays of the Armenian author V. Madatov were also started to stage in the Azerbaijanian language. After the arrival of Firudin Kocharli to work as a teacher in Yerevan in 1885, drama theatre also encountered the successful performances. He was eager to participate in the city's cultural occasions and assembles a troupe which staged “Monsieur Jordan and the Dervish Mesteli Shah” base on the Akhundov's play in 1886. The play staged in Turkish language by the students of the Teacher's Seminary on 4 April 1886.
Since 1896, performances in the Azeri language have started to take place regularly in Yerevan. In the pre-revolutionary years, the amateurs were staged several well-known plays in the region such as "The Inspector General" Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol, "Haji Gara" M.F. Akhundov, "Nadir Shah" Nariman Narimanov, "Deads" Jalil Mammadguluzade. Early staged plays were: Dursunali and Ballibadi (1893), Girt-girt (Cluck) (1893), Haji Gara (1894), Reluctant Marriage (1899). These plays were staged in the small venues and were not covered by press.
Canpoladov Brother's theatre was also chosen as a place for staging the plays in Yerevan. On 8 December 1896 "Monsieur Jordan and Dervish Mastali Shah" was performed in that theatre. E. Ter-Grigoryan praised this play and performers, especially, the role of Shahrabanu in the writing of the newspaper Nor dar (New age) of 19 December 1896. The role of Shahrabanu was acted by Yunis Nuri who worked for fifty years in the Yerevan Drama Theatre as an actor, stage director and director of the theater. During the working years in the theatre he along with Mashadi Ismayil staged some plays such as, The Vizier of the Lenkeran Khan (1897), Avarice Creates Enemies (1899), My tongue is my enemy (1900), The Alchemist Molla Ibrahimkhalil (1901), Ignorance (with E.Sultanov, 1902), Haji Gara (with F. Abdulla, 1902). Moreover, his further plays were staged in the wider Canpoladov Brother's theatre between 1905 and 1909, including "The Government Inspector" by Gogol.
Further history.
The theater operated until 1988 (with a break in 1949 - 1967). The central place in the repertoire of the theater was covered by musical comedies "Arshin mal alan", Mashadi Ibad (If Not That One, Then This One) Uzeyir Hajibeyov. At different times, Yunis Nuri, Kazim Zia, Ali Shahsabakhly and others performed in the theater.
During the years of 1934 - 1951 the main director of the theater was Bakhshi Galandarly. "Othello" was staged by the Yerevan drama theater named after J. Jabbarly in the "All-Union Festival of Shakespearean Performances", dedicated to the 380th anniversary of the birth of William Shakespeare in April 1944.
After a long break for several years, the theater started to work in Yerevan again in 1967. The plays such as, "Sevil" by J. Jabbarly, "Namus" by A. Shirvanzade, "Farhad and Shirin" by S. Vurgun, "Flame" by A. Erevanly and A. Suleymanov were included in repertoire of theater.
Establishment of the theater.
In March 1928 Yerevan Turkish theater was established under the leadership of Yunis Nuri. The theater functioned in the Armenian SSR, remaining the only Azerbaijani theater in Armenia. In the 1930s, the theater was called the "Azerbaijan state theater named after J. Jabbarly or the "Armenian State Turkish theater named after J. Jabbarly.
Current activity.
Since 1989 the troupe of the theater continued its activity in Baku, in the theatrical studio at the Azerbaijan Drama Theater. In 1994 the status of state was again given to the theater by the decree of the President of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev. Yerevan State Azerbaijan theater continues to stage plays in Azerbaijan and Georgia, Dagistan and Turkey. On 16 October 2007 the theater's anniversary was celebrated at the Azerbaijan State Musical Comedy theater in Baku by the presidential decree.

Mahadeva of Devagiri

Mahadeva (IAST: Mahā-deva, r. c. 1261-1270 CE) was a ruler of the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty of Deccan region in India. He succeeded his brother Krishna on the throne.
Mahadeva defeated the Shilaharas of Kolhapur, and suppressed a rebellion by his Kadamba feudatories. He invaded the neighbouring kingdoms, but was forced to retreat by the Kakatiya queen Rudrama and the Hoysala king Narasimha II. The Yadava records also credit him with other military successes, but these claims may be exaggerated.
Early life.
Mahadeva was a younger brother of his predecessor Krishna. Their father Jaitugi II seems to have died before their grandfather Simhana, because of which Krishna succeeded Simhana.
Mahadeva assisted his brother in the administration, as attested by an inscription as well as the text "Vedanta-kalpataru". During Krishna's reign, Mahadeva was designated as the heir apparent ("yuvaraja") since at least 1250, probably because Krishna's son Ramachandra had not been born, or was not old enough to hold the title of "yuvaraja" at the time of his ascension. At the time of Krishna's death, Ramachandra seems to have been a minor, and therefore, Mahadeva became the new king.
The last inscription from Krishna's reign is dated May 1261. The first record from Mahadeva's reign is a copper-plate inscription dated 21 August 1261, which records a grant made on the occasion of his coronation. Mahadeva must have ascended the throne sometime in August 1261, if not on 21 August.
Wars.
Shilaharas of Thane.
Mahadeva's father Simhana had subjugated the Shilaharas of Kolhapur around 1215. The kings of another Shilahara branch continued to rule as Yadava feudatories with their capital at Thane. However, these Shilahara rulers occasionally fought with the Yadavas to assert their independence, and such a conflict took place early in Mahadeva's reign.
According to the Yadava court poet Hemadri, Mahadeva sent an army including a strong elephant force against the Shilahara ruler Someshvara. After being defeated on the land, Someshvara boarded his ships, but Mahadeva's navy pursued him, and Someshvara drowned in the sea. Hemadri states that Someshvara preferred drowning to capture, because he believed that "the fire burning under the ocean would be less oppressive than the wrath of Mahadeva".
It is not clear if Mahadeva's conquest put an end to the Shilahara branch of Thane, and resulted in the annexation of their territory to the Yadava kingdom. A fragmentary 1266 inscription names "Maharajadhiraja Konkana-chakravarti" Jaitugi-deva as the ruler of Konkan, and lists Mainayaka and Chandra-prabhu among his ministers. These two ministers also ` Someshvara, and the title "Konkana-chakravarti" was used by the Shilhara titles. According to one theory, Jaitugi was a son or relative of Someshvara, and had managed to re-establish the Shlihara power. However, the name Jaitugi was borne by earlier members of the Yadava dynasty. This, coupled with the title "Maharajadhiraja", suggests that Jaitugi may have been a Yadava prince who governed the annexed territory with assistance of the former Shilahara ministers.
Kakatiyas.
The Kakatiya kingdom, located to the east of the Yadava kingdom, suffered from chaos after the death of the Kakatiya king Ganapati in 1261-1262. Queen Rudrama, the successor of Ganapati, faced rebellions from feudatories. Taking advantage of this situation, Mahadeva invaded the Kakatiya kingdom.
According to the Yadava court poet Hemadri, the Yadava army defeated the Kakatiya forces, and captured several elephants. Hemadri also states that Mahadeva advanced up to the Kakatiya capital, but did not conquer it because his enemy was a woman. The veracity of this claim is doubtful. Other records suggest that the Kakatiyas repulsed the Yadava invasion. The "Pratapa-charita" states that Rudrama's forces defeated Mahadeva's army, and pursued it till the Yadava capital Devagiri. A fragmentary Kannada language inscription also states that the Kakatiya general Bhairava defeated the Yadava army, which may be a reference to his repulsion of Mahadeva's invasion. A coin of Mahadeva bears the Kakatiya emblem varaha with the Yadava symbols; this varaha may have been stuck on Mahadeva's coins to mark the Kakatiya victory.
Hoysalas.
By the 1260s, the southern Hoysala kingdom had been divided into two parts, and its northern part was ruled by Narasimha II. Around 1266, Mahadeva invaded Narasimha's kingdom, and the existence of Yadava inscriptions in the Hoysala territory (such as the Chitradurga district) indicate Yadava influence there. The invasion was ultimately unsuccessful, and Mahadeva was forced to retreat. Two Hoysala inscriptions state that Mahadeva underestimated Narasimha's power, and entered the battlefield on his elephant in grandiose style; however, he was defeated and fled away on his horse at night.
Kadambas.
The Kadamba feudatories of the Yadavas rebelled against Mahadeva, probably encouraged by his defeat against the Hoysalas. Mahadeva's general Balige-deva suppressed the rebellion in c. 1268.
Vaghelas.
The Paithan inscription of the Yadavas states that Mahadeva defeated the northern Vaghela king Visala-deva. Mahadeva ascended the throne in 1261, and Visala died in 1262. Therefore, either Mahadeva defeated Visala immediately after his ascension, or this may a reference to a military campaign conducted during Krishna's reign, in which Mahadeva participated as the heir apparent.
Other campaigns.
According to the Harihara inscription, fearing Mahadeva, the Gaudas "entered anthills", and the Utkalas "losing shame, fled away". These achievements of Mahadeva seem to be purely imaginary. Hemadri claims that Mahadeva's norther neighbours - the Malavas - made a boy their king, because they knew that Mahadeva would not attack a minor. However, the real reason for Mahadeva not attacking their kingdom was probably his preoccupation with campaigns against his southern neighbours.
Administration.
Mahadeva's prime minister ("Sarvadhikarin") was Maharaja Tapparasa, who held this post until 1275. His other officers and subordinates included:
Mahadeva's queen Vaijayi is credit with building the Vaijanatha temple at Paithan.
Last days.
The last known date of Mahadeva is May–June 1270; he died soon after. He was succeeded by his son Ammana, but his nephew Ramachandra forcefully dethroned Ammana and became the new king in 1271.

Cash gave evidence to the Penrose Inquiry and has been outspoken about Britain's tainted blood scandal in which thousands of haemophiliacs died. Cash was critical of the Inquiry's Final Report, he said it had failed to get to the truth and allowed the responsible executives to avoid giving evidence.
In May 2017 he appeared in "BBC Panorama"'s "Contaminated Blood: The Search for the Truth", stating "If you look at the difference in England and Scotland in terms of the outcomes, you have to conclude that it was not unavoidable, it was avoidable".

Naturally (Houston Person album)

Naturally is an album by saxophonist Houston Person which was recorded in 2012 and released on the HighNote label.
Reception.
In his review on AllMusic, Steve Leggett states "whether he's doing soul-jazz, disco, R&amp;B, or gospel, he's always had this easygoing, big-sounding sax tone that embraces and envelops rather than challenges listeners. This set, recorded in July of 2012 at the famed Van Gelder Recording Studio, finds Person assembling a jazz supergroup of sorts ... and together they make a joyous, smooth, and open sound that feels comfortable, warm, and, well, natural. ... everything here fits into the same sort of groove quilt that Person has been doing like no one else for years now. He's simply an American treasure". In JazzTimes, Sharonne Cohen noted "Houston Person still seems to be a discovery for some. Both newcomers to his music and longtime fans will no doubt enjoy this latest recording featuring a formidable group ... this throwback album is nonetheless fresh and imaginative. Aptly titled, it’s a relaxed, compelling set on which Person and his bandmates demonstrate unaffected dexterity, swing and soul".

Early life.
Dominique Jones was born in Atlanta, Georgia in the Oakland City neighborhood. He was two years old when his father left the family, leaving his single mother to raise him and his two sisters. While he was not struggling academically, Jones would repeatedly get in trouble, resulting in him dropping out of Booker T. Washington High School in the ninth grade.
In early 2012, he was charged for possession with intent to sell among other charges. His original lawyer urged him to take a two-year plea deal, but Jones refused, and acquired a new lawyer. This new lawyer placed Jones in a special program that would only hold him for a year. While in this program, he got into an altercation with a white prisoner over racial comments.

Atarib market massacre

The Atarib market massacre, Atarib market bombings or 2017 Atarib airstrike were three aerial bombardments on a marketplace in the Syrian rebel-held town of Atarib in the Aleppo Governorate of Syria perpetrated on 13 November 2017, during the Syrian Civil War. These airstrikes hit a commercial street with a market and a police station. The bombings killed 84 civilians, including six women and five children, and injured another 150 people. Atarib was part of the "Safe Zone" established in September 2017. 
"Under the laws of war, police and police stations are presumptively civilian objects unless the police are taking a direct part in the hostilities", Human Rights Watch said. Eyewitness reports claimed that the entire market, containing 100 shops, was destroyed in the explosions. They damaged or destroyed an area of approximately 5,000 sq metres. Weapons used were the unguided OFAB-500 fragmentation bomb, and the BETAB-500 unguided bunker buster bomb.
On 6 March 2018, the United Nations Human Rights Council published a public report confirming that these airstrikes were perpetrated by the Russian military. A Russian fixed-wing aircraft using unguided weapons, including blast weapons, were used against this location. The report concluded that using such heavy weapons on densely populated civilian areas may amount to a war crime.
Events.
Between 14:07 and 14:11, the Atarib market and police station were targeted by three air strikes resulting in the death of at least 84 people and injuring of 150.
UN investigation.
On 6 March 2018, the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic published a report on the attack, saying it was carried out by the Russian Air Force and may constitute a war crime.
According to the Commission's report, "early warning observers monitored the take-off of a fixed-wing aircraft, whose pilots communicated in Russian, from Hemeimeem airbase at 1:37 p.m. and tracked the aircraft going south and then to the northeast all the way to Atarib where it arrived at 2:07 p.m". The report said the attack "may account to a war crime of launching indiscriminate attacks resulting in death and injury to civilians."
Human Rights Watch.
"Under the laws of war, police and police stations are presumptuously civilian objects unless the police are taking a direct part in the hostilities", Human Rights Watch said. Eyewitness reports claimed that the entire market, containing 100 shops, was destroyed in the explosions. They damaged or destroyed an area of approximately 5,000 sq metres. Weapons used were the unguided OFAB-500 fragmentation bomb, and the BETAB-500 unguided bunker buster bomb.
Two previous attacks had targeted the market on 25 July 2016 (8 dead) and 24 April 2014 (31 dead).

Amira Medunjanin

Amira Medunjanin (; , ; born 23 April 1972) is a Bosnian singer and interpreter of sevdalinka. She holds both citizenship of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Biography.
Medunjanin was born in Sarajevo and her fascination with the Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina led her to devote herself to creating a unique voice within sevdalinka.
Singer, humanitarian, and global ambassador for both the culture and music of her native Bosnia and Herzegovina and the wider Balkan region, Medunjanin has been described as, "one of the great voices of her generation" (The Observer) with a voluptuous sound that, "hovers enticingly between East and West" ("Uncut").
In 2003 Medunjanin recorded her first single "Mujo đogu po mejdanu voda" as a guest singer on Mostar Sevdah Reunion album.
After guesting on Mostar Sevdah Reunion's album "A Secret Gate" in 2003, Medunjanin recorded her debut album "Rosa", on Snail Records in 2005. The album was excellently received in Great Britain and throughout Europe and was among the candidates for the album of the year. In April 2009 she released her "Live" album, a recording of a concert held at the Jazz Fest Sarajevo in 2008. In March 2010 the studio album "Zumra" was released, which fused contemporary accordion and arrangements to traditional melody, lyrics and vocal styling. The album "Amulette" was released by Harmonia Mundi / World Village on October 3, 2011.
The next album "Silk and Stone" was released by Aquarius Records in May 2014. The album received some good reviews in British media; The Guardian awarded 4* to the album, noting Medunjanin's "intimate, pained and gently compelling voice" and Nigel Williamson has described the album as a "career-defining third album from Bosnia's finest export" in "Uncut"".
On her next album "Damar" as in all her previous productions, Amira drew from Sevdah, the "beating heart" of Balkan music, reviving ancestral Balkan songs, whilst for the first time introducing new compositions and once again the Serbian pianist Bojan Z provides musical and production skills. The album was ranked among the 40 best in the world for 2017 by Transglobal World Music Chart.
On her most recent album, "Ascending", Medunjanin is once again attracted to the source of traditional Sevdah with a new revival of the rebellious songs with Trondheim Soloists, and for the second time introduces a new composition into her visual repertoire.

Henry Walter Jenvey

Henry Walter Jenvey (7 February 1851 – 14 July 1932) was a senior public servant, initially with the Victorian Post Office and following Federation, the federal Postmaster-General's Department. He was heavily involved in the development of Victoria's telegraphy and telephony networks, and subsequently their integration into those of the Commonwealth. One of Australia's earliest wireless experimenters, he could reasonably be described as Australia's first amateur radio operator, since the majority of his experiments was self-funded and in his private time.
Professional career.
Telegraph Electrical Society.
In August 1874, Jenvey was a founding member of the Victorian Telegraph Electrical Society and was in the initial committee of management together with contemporaries Smibert, McGaurin and Mickle. Membership was restricted to employees of the Victorian Postal Department as their meeting and experimental room was provided by the Department. Jenvey was a driving force behind the society. After only three months the membership was already 89 persons and papers had been read by all the luminaries of the wireless section. Monthly meeting were held in the Athenaeum and papers were presented which addressed the cutting edge of telegraphy and telephony technology at the time. The society was dormant for two years from 1888, but was reformed in 1890 with Jenvey as president. The society was eventually renamed the Victorian Electrical Society.
Wireless experiments.
In late 1896, Henry Walter Jenvey, in explaining "Telegraphy without Wires" to the press, refers only to the leakage and inductive methods. But soon afterwards, he himself was actively engaged in the electromagnetic method. 
In 1899 his lectures had been extended to include Marconi's system. The successful experiments by Walker in Sydney in August 1899 prompted Jenvey to reveal that for some weeks he had been exchanging messages between the General Post Office and the Telephone exchange at Willis Street, a distance of a half mile. The first message to grace the airwaves of Melbourne was "Long reign Duffy" referring to the then Postmaster-General for Victoria. By 1900 he was reporting that an experimental network of wireless stations had been established at the Observatory, Wilson Hall at the University and the General Post Office. As part of the Congress of the Association for the Advancement of Science, on 12 January 1900, Jenvey presented a lecture on the current state of wireless telegraphy in the world at the Wilson Hall of the University of Melbourne. At the conclusion of the lecture, he then sent a request from his station erected in the hall and received in return the word "Melbourne" from his station in the tower of the General Post Office. Jenvey continued his experiments throughout 1900, with regular stations established at Heidelberg and Doncaster. From April 1901, efforts concentrated on Point Ormond, Port Phillip Bay and a station was established with a 155 ft. pole near the shoreline, to take advantage of the better propagation over salt water. From Point Ormond, communication was soon established with Point Cook, a distance of 10 miles, by means of a kite-borne aerial at the latter location. The timing of this extension of transmission distance for Jenvey's apparatus was sublime. The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York were to visit Australia to participate in the celebrations of Federation. Jenvey sought and obtained permission from Senator Drake, the Postmaster-General, to erect a facility at Queenscliff to send greetings to the royal party as they approached Port Phillip Bay. In the first week of May, a large tent was erected on the recreation reserve near the fort and the equipment installed. On Sunday evening 5 May 1901, news was received at Queenscliff that the R.M.S. Ophir was off Split Point and the message of greeting was sent. No reply was received, but it was later confirmed that the message was received by the escorting ships, but the absence of a Naval code precluded a response. While the convoy was in port, Jenvey established contact with Lieutenant Trousdale, R.N., of the warship and messages were then regularly exchanged with the Point Ormond station. When most of the convoy departed on 18 May, Jenvey exchanged messages with the "St. George" on the initial part of her journey. The last message received from the "St. George" was at a distance of 37 miles, a record for Australia which would stand for some years. He continued his experiments throughout the 1900s, but prioritised the essential work of developing and integrating the telegraphic and telephonic networks of the fledgling Commonwealth.
Postal Commission 1908.
Jenvey gave evidence on a number of occasions at the Postal Commission 1908.
Late life and legacy.
Jenvey retired from the Postmaster-General's Department in 1910 after 40 years of service.
Jenvey passed 14 July 1932 at his home in Carnegie, at age 81 years, with but brief mention of his enduring life's work. His son William Walter Jenvey followed in his father's footsteps and was licensed as an amateur radio operator from the 1920s. Callsigns allocated between 1925 and 1961 were 3AY, VK3AY, VK2YJ and VK2ZO. William was active in a number of Melbourne amateur radio societies in the early 1920s.
A plaque has been erected at Fort Queenscliff to commemorate the 6 May 1901 greetings sent by Jenvey to the Royal Visitors. It reads as follows: "On 6 May 1901, from near the Black Lighthouse, an address of welcome to the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York arriving by ship to open the first Federal parliament was successfully transmitted by H. W. Jenvey, MIEE, electrical engineer, Victorian Postal Department using equipment he designed, built and operated. This was the first Australian shore to ship wireless telegraph communication except for pre-arranged experiments."'online

A Girl of the Limberlost (1934 film)

A Girl of the Limberlost is a 1934 American drama film, directed by Christy Cabanne. It stars Louise Dresser, Ralph Morgan and Marian Marsh, and was released on October 15, 1934. This is the second film adaption of Gene Stratton-Porter's 1909 novel of the same name. The first film adaptation had been released in 1924, and a third was released in 1945.
Plot.
In Indiana in 1893, Katherine Comstock discusses with her neighbors Margaret and Wesley Sinton about her child who is due. Katherine’s husband Robert is walking back home that night and takes a path through the Limberlost swamp, but he gets tripped up and falls into a pool of quicksand. Katherine heads out into the swamp to help him, but by the time she reaches him, there’s not much she can do as she watches her husband drown. Later after the birth of the child who has been named Elnora, Wesley and Margaret are seen with the baby discussing how sad it is that Katherine dislikes her newborn daughter. They wish that they could keep the baby if Katherine does not want to keep her as they have recently lost a child of their own, but Wesley says Elnora is the last thing Katherine has left after her husband died.
The story flashes forward many years later when Elnora is now a teenager. Elnora tells her mother that she is going to high school though Kathrine initially refuses wanting her daughter to stay home and do chores. On her way to school, Elnora stops by the Limberlost swamp at a tree where inside she has been storing some of her belongings including a moth collection. Once she’s at school, she’s met with some taunting from her fellow classmates which discourages her from wanting to return the next day. She later visits the Sintons who encourage her to keep her spirits up and offer to help her pay for the books she needs for classes. At home, Katherine continues to treat Elnora with cruelty blaming her for the death of her husband.
When Elnora heads to school for her second day, she catches a young boy named Billy attempting to steal from someone’s home. She sits down with him and offers to him some of her lunch. After school, Elnora visits Mrs. Parker who is known as “The Bird Woman” around their community. The Sintons’ had given Elnora the lady’s name letting her know that she would be able to help her. On her way home, Elnora encounters Billy again who tells her that his dad is too sick that he won’t move or talk. They go to his house and see that his father had died, so Elnora takes Billy to the Sintons’ for help. The Sinton’s end up taking Billy in to care for him themselves.
Some time later, Dr. Ammon visits the Sintons with his nephew Phillip who takes an interest in Elnora. He offers her money for the Indian relics she had been collecting and tells her to use the money for her college funds. They later adventure into the Limberlost chasing moths to add into her collection. While there, he talk about his fiancé Edith back home in Washington and that he was leaving town that night. They part with a promise to stay in touch.
In June 1913, Elnora is seen writing a letter to Phillip letting him know that she had saved up enough money to pay for college and that she no longer needed his help as he had once promised to her. However, she checks her stash of funds that she had kept in the tree in the swamp and learns that it has been stolen along with her moth collection. Elnora is distraught that she has lost the money she had been saving especially because she was planning on buying a new dress for her graduation that’s coming up soon, but her mother offers to find a dress for her herself. However, on the day of her graduation, Elnora finds out that her mother did not get the dress she had promised. After an argument, Elnora heads off to Mrs. Parker’s who offers to make her a graduation dress.
The two head to Elnora’s school together for the ceremony as Katherine watches from across the street clearly upset over her daughter running off to others for help instead of her. She heads home and runs into Billy who tells her how much money Elnora had lost and that he thinks he knows who stole the money. Katherine heads to the suspected culprit's house, but does not find him. She instead finds a sickly woman who she learns had an affair with her husband Robert up until his death. Katherine heads to Mrs. Parker’s house to find Elnora and begs her for forgiveness for treating her so terribly over a man who never loved her like she had thought. They reunite as Elnora forgives her mother.
After they arrive back home, Phillip comes back to town with his fiancé Edith. They invite Elnora to a party Phillip’s uncle is throwing for them the next day. She is initially reluctant but is encouraged by her mother to attend. At the party, Edith expresses her frustration at Phillip for talking about Elnora all night. When Phillip and Elnora meet up later that night, they come across a yellow emperor moth they had been looking for before and chase after it into the Limberlost. They stop to talk, and Phillip leans in to kiss her, after which they agree they should head back to the party. When they get back, Edith accuses Phillip of cheating with Elnora though they both deny it.
The next day, Phillip goes to the Comstock house to tell Elnora that he and Edith had ended their engagement and wishes to have a relationship with her instead. Elnora refuses him and tells him that she feels guilty thinking she’s the reason they had broken up. Feeling distraught over her conflicted feelings, Elnora cries to herself in the middle of the Limberlost claiming she no longer cared about her moths or college or anything anymore. Phillip goes off into the Limberlost to find her, but he finds her fallen into a pool of mud. He pulls her out and they embrace as the movie comes to a close.
Production.
"The Hollywood Reporter" announced in late June 1934 that actress Marian Marsh, who played Elnora Comstock, had signed for the “Limberlost” leading role, and two days later they announced that Henry B. Walthall had signed for the film. Their announcement also included that Eddie Nugent, Gigi Parrish, Barbra Bedford, and Betty Blythe were signed for the film and that W.T. Lackey was to produce the film.
"The Film Daily" reported in mid-July that during the removal of Monogram headquarters from the General Service Studios to the Pathe Studios in Culver City, the production of “Girl of the Limberlost” had been at Talisman Studios. In early August they reported that the film was currently in the cutting room.
Diana Carey, who played an uncredited role as one of the high school students, described the rushed production schedule for the film:"On a feature-length version of "The Girl of Limberlost" in which I played a role, no actor was ever idle nor did a camera ever get cold. We were shooting at five-thirty in the morning, and while one scene was being filmed another crew was setting up for the next. Actors rushed from one set-up to another without rest, and with barely time for rehearsal... Lunch was bolted down between takes. We sprinted through that feature-length juvenile masterpiece in five days flat, something of a record even in my book.”
Reception.
The world premiere of the film was set for the week of September 15, 1934 at the Broadway Portland. After its release, the film was met with a warm reception being described by a review in "The Film Daily" as a “wholesome drama of backwoods [that] has the heart appeal and human touches for the crowds.” The film was also awarded the Best Picture of the Month Medal by "Parents’ Magazine".

Heather Sutherland

Heather Sutherland (1903–1953) was an Australian architect working pre- and post-World War II in Canberra, the nation's capital. Together with her husband Malcolm Moir she formed the architecture practice, Moir &amp; Sutherland. Their work is considered significant as it represents some of the earliest Canberran examples of 'truly modern design'.
Biography.
Heather McDonald Sutherland was born in Sydney on 25 May 1903. After her mother died in 1919, Sutherland's father remarried and from this marriage she had two half-siblings, including the opera singer Joan Sutherland. Sutherland completed high school in Sydney and then enrolled in the University of Sydney's architecture degree, completing her studies in 1926. Post-graduation she worked in the office of Clement Glancey, before marrying Moir in 1936. They eventually formed a partnership, producing works together from the 1930s-50s until Sutherland's death in a car accident in 1953.
Influence.
Moir &amp; Sutherland were "prolific" designers during Canberra's inter- and post-war years. Their influential and "radical" functionalist architecture existed in stark contrast to the Spanish Mission, and Georgian and Tudor revival styles that had dominated Canberra's nascent inner suburbs. In recognition of the practice's impact on Canberra architecture, the city's branch of the Australian Institute of Architects named its residential award after the couple.

Law Against Rehabilitation of Nazism

Law Against Rehabilitation of Nazism is a Russian memory law of 2014. It also known as Yarovaya Law, after a Russian politician (Irina Yarovaya) who was instrumental in passing it.
The law was originally proposed in 2009. It was approved by the Russian parliament in April 2014, and signed into law by President of Russia Vladimir Putin in May that year.
Contents.
The law introduced Article 354.1 to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, making it a criminal offense "to deny facts recognized by the international military tribunal that judged and punished the major war criminals of the European Axis countries [this refers to the Nuremberg trials], to approve of the crimes this tribunal judged, and to spread intentionally false information about the Soviet Union’s activities during World War II" as well as "the spreading of information on military and memorial commemorative dates related to Russia’s defense that is clearly disrespectful of society, and to publicly desecrate symbols of Russia’s military glory".
Criticism.
The law has been the subject of domestic and international criticism, due to fears of its impact on free speech and historical research. A BBC report in 2017 noted that the law has "curbed...the public discussion of WW2 history". Human Rights Watch report in 2017 noted that "[the law's] selective implementation has so far led to several unjust sentences".
Russian government officials have dismissed these objections, noting that the law is similar to many other laws known as laws against Holocaust denial, particularly common in Europe. Historian Ivan Kurilla addressed that, saying that while the first European memory laws "were propagated by left-wing political forces aiming to preserve the memory of oppressed groups and the crimes of their states", newer laws, such as the Russian one, are increasingly "backed by pro-state right-wing politicians that seek to create a heroic national narrative and legislate away any doubt about the state’s historical righteousness". Historian Nikolay Koposov wrote that the main goal of the law is "to promote the cult of the Russian state, whose primary incarnation rests in the celebration of the heroic memory of World War II".
Applications.
Shortly after its passage, the law was used to convict Russian blogger Vladimir Luzgin, who compared the September 1939 German invasion of Poland to the Soviet invasion of Poland and referred to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, writing on Russian social media platform VKontakte that "communism and Nazism closely collaborated". Prosecutors accused him of knowingly posting material that may worsen people's view of the Soviet Union, and the court agreed, stating that he had falsified history by stating "that the communists and Germany jointly attacked Poland, unleashing World War Two, or in other words, that Communism and Nazism co-operated honestly". Luzgin was fined 200 thousand rubles (roughly ) for "circulation of false information about the activities of the USSR during the years of World War II", though, as was noted by human rights expert Jacob Mchangama, this claim was "essentially, factually correct". In 2016 Lugzin appealed his case to the European Court of Human Rights.
In April 2015, Russian journalist Polina Petruseva was fined 1,000 rubles (US$) for posting on the social media platform VKontakte a historical picture showing German Nazi troops in Russia, a picture otherwise available from, among others, Wikipedia. That same month, a number of Russian bookstores stopped selling the anti-Nazi graphic novel "Maus" because of a swastika appearing on its cover design. A toy store selling toy soldiers in wartime German uniforms was also investigated, and a museum displaying anti-Nazi Soviet posters, showing for example crushed swastikas, decided to censor all swastikas on its exhibits.
Works of two British historians, Antony Beevor and John Keegan, were banned in one of Russia's regions as the authorities accused them of being influenced by Nazi propaganda. A month later, another Russian journalist, Sergei Vilkov, was fined 1,000 rubles for posting a caricature on VKontakte (in 2011), which combined the logo of the United Russia and a swastika.
In March 2021 the Duma passed amendments to the law in the Criminal and Administrative Codes that envisage fines of up to 5 million rubles ($68,000) for entities or individuals convicted of the "public dissemination of knowingly false information" about WWII veterans. The changes were proposed after a Russian judge in February 2021 fined jailed opposition politician Aleksei Navalny 850,000 rubles ($11,500) for slandering a 94-year-old WWII veteran who had participated in a Kremlin-organized promotional video. The bill was signed by Vladimir Putin in April 2021.

Lars S. Andersen House

The Lars S. Andersen House, located at 213 N. 200 East in Ephraim, Utah, was built in 1870. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
The house's original section is a stone "square-cabin" in what is now the southwest corner of the house. Two adobe rooms were added to the east, making a three-room pair house of Scandinavian form. Its south-facing facade is unusual, among "Type II pair-houses", for its symmetrical six openings (of 2-2-2 per room) rather than more common (1-3-1 per room) configuration. A long overhanging porch was added along this facade, at that time, with stylized square columns having carved scrollwork at their tops.
Later, an entire one-and-a-half-story T-plan house, of Victorian pattern book design, was added to the north rear, with the base of the T joining the rear of the main house. This portion has corbelled brickwork along its raking eaves and cornice returns, and it has a porch with milled porch posts and scroll-cut tracery.
Andersen was born in Denmark in 1829. He immigrated to Utah and eventually became Bishop of Ephraim.
The house is on the northwest corner of N. 200 East and E. 200 North.

2018 Vienna stabbings

On 7 March 2018, two stabbings occurred in Vienna, Austria during the evening. A man has been arrested for both attacks. On 11 March 2018, there was a separate stabbing attack at the Embassy of Iran in the city. The Austrian government hardened its asylum policy after the attacks.
Events.
Attack in Leopoldstadt.
At 7:45pm, a family was attacked by a man outside a Japanese restaurant in Leopoldstadt, central Vienna, using a knife, three individuals in a family group were injured. At 8:15pm, suspect stabbed a Chechen immigrant drug at the Praterstern train station. An Afghan man, carrying two knives, was arrested. A blood trail lead the police to his hideout.
Suspect and motive.
Although initially unclear if the two incidents were connected, the arrested 23-year-old man admitted attacking the family earlier in the night, though claimed that the attacks were not politically motivated. The suspect allegedly attacked the family because of his "bad, aggressive mood" and frustration about his whole life situation. A 67-year-old father received life-threatening injuries, the 56-year-old wife and the 17-year-old daughter were seriously injured. The suspect said that he committed the attack on the second man, a 20-year-old, because he made him responsible for his drug addiction.
The assailant arrived in Austria in 2015 European migrant crisis.
On 10 March, media reported that the suspect had already been convicted of drug trafficking in 2016 and obtained three months of conditional detention. That was confirmed by the police. The day before, the authorities had confirmed that the man had been in prison from August to December 2017 - also for drug trafficking - in Klagenfurt.
On 12 March 2018 ORF reported, that the suspect had tried to commit suicide while in detention.
Investigation.
The Austrian Interior Ministry launched an investigation to determine possible mistakes made by the authorities regarding a possible earlier deportation of the suspect. On 15 March the Austrian Interior Minister Herbert Kickl spoke of a communication problem between the involved bodies, which led to the release of the convicted perpetrator.
Attack on Embassy of Iran.
On 11:30 pm on 11 March 2018, an Austrian soldier was attacked with a knife in front of the Iranian embassy in Vienna which he guarded. The soldier was stabbed repeatedly, and injured, but his life was saved by the stab-proof vest he was wearing. The attacker was shot dead. Security was stepped up at diplomatic missions across the city, because the police feared that other people may have been involved in the attack. A police spokesman said, that the soldier was only saved by a stab-proof vest: "They started a fight because the aggressor was too close and the soldier shot him at least four times with his handgun." The attacker’s home was searched and his internet activities were reviewed.
The perpetrator was a 26-year-old Austrian of Egyptian origin. Authorities said, he sympathized with radical Islamist ideology, but the exact motive was subject to further investigation.
Reactions.
The Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz commented at the Leopoldstadt case: "It is clear that many mistakes have been made in recent years in the migration and asylum policy. Unlimited migration is the cause of many problems we are currently facing. Therefore, the new Federal Government wants to fix these mistakes of the past years."
In the Profil magazine, the Afghanistan expert Sarajuddin Rasuly stated on the Leopoldstadt case: "Some refugees from Afghanistan came as criminals or became it during their journey. Between Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey they went stealing or trafficking for the smugglers. Some young men were even raped by them. When they arrive in Austria, they are dehumanized and no longer conform to the norms of a functioning society. They have lost the threshold for violence." 
Impact.
On 13 March the Austrian Interior Minister Herbert Kickl announced that Austria will change its asylum policy because of the incidents in the recent days, saying: "We need courageous approaches... The current asylum law will no longer meet the demands of a globalized world." The Austrian government intends to use the EU Presidency in the second half of the year to win alliances in Europe on this issue. In addition, he announced that he wants to improve the system of "Rückkehrberatung" ("return counseling") for asylum seekers.

In Darkness (2018 film)

In Darkness is a 2018 thriller film directed by Anthony Byrne and written by Byrne and Natalie Dormer. It stars Dormer, Ed Skrein, Emily Ratajkowski and Joely Richardson. The film was released on 25 May 2018 in the United States by Vertical Entertainment and on 6 July 2018 in the United Kingdom by Shear Entertainment.
Plot.
Sofia McKendrick (Natalie Dormer) is a blind pianist who lives in an apartment in London, and is haunted by the murder of her family by Serbian paramilitaries. Her neighbor is Veronique (Emily Ratajkowski), the daughter of Serbian philanthropist Zoran Radic (Jan Bijvoet), who has committed war crimes during the Bosnian War, and currently suspected of running criminal organizations. Despite the controversy surrounding Veronique's family, Sofia appears to have an amicable relationship with her, although lately has been noticing something wrong with her. During a discussion in an elevator, Veronique slips Sofia a USB drive and tells her that the perfume is Liquid Gold. One night, Sofia overhears a struggle occurring in Veronique's room and witnesses Veronique fall to her death. Despite this, Sofia denies witnessing anything to the police Detective Mills (Neil Maskell), while discreetly holding the USB drive.
Later at an event hosted by Radic, Sofia performs and overhears Radic and his associates discussing the circumstances of Veronique's death, in the process revealing that he was the one behind it. Radic's head of security Alexandra Gordon (Joely Richardson) and her brother Marc (Ed Skrein) have a discreet conversation and it is revealed that Veronique was twelve weeks pregnant and that Marc was sent to kill her; it is also revealed that Marc was having an affair with her and is likely the father of her child. Radic forms a fixation on Sofia for her connection to Veronique, and Sofia ends up having to dodge police questions and Radic's men looking over Veronique's apartment. 
Marc rescues Sofia from a rape attempt and later saves her from an attempted kidnapping and torture. Sofia spends some time with Marc and learns of his and Veronique's affair, and he explains to her that Veronique committed suicide out of paranoia. This in turn leads to an affair between Marc and Sofia. As it turns out Sofia has her own vendetta towards Radic, as she confides in her adopted father Niall (James Cosmo), and gives him the USB drive and reveals that Liquid Gold is the drive's password, which reveals Radic's assets and his criminal operations. Sofia recounts how while she was blind, she had a sister, Balma, who could see but would pretend to be blind for her sister's benefit. It's revealed that Sofia's family were once friends with Radic in Bosnia, but Radic betrayed her family and personally lead the paramilitaries in the massacre of Sofia's family. Niall was a soldier who rescued and protected Sofia for years while she was planning revenge. In addition to this, it's discovered that Veronique has been planning to expose the truth of her father's crimes, but knew that her days were numbered; this was the reason she gave Sofia the USB drive.
Sofia learns that Alexandra is also looking for the USB drive, hoping to use the information to usurp Radic and his operations. Sofia hands Alexandra a copy of the drive in exchange for a private audience with Radic at Veronique's funeral. There, Sofia holds a blade to Radic's throat and he realizes the truth of Sofia's past and motives; Radic taunts Sofia by revealing he was in love with her mother, and that he raped her shortly before she gave birth to a daughter; Radic implies and is under the impression that Sofia is his biological daughter. Radic leaves the funeral as Sofia is emotionally devastated by these revelations. As Detective Mills looks into Sofia's past, it's also discovered that "Sofia" is an alias; the "real" Sofia was Niall's biological daughter who died in infancy, and Niall named Balma "Sofia" after taking her in. Niall soon passes away while in the hospital.
When Radic discovers Alexandra's treachery, and orders her to be killed; despite the appeal from his sister, Marc leaves Alexandra to die due to her indirect involvement with his unborn child's death. Radic drives to Sofia's apartment with the intent on personally killing her, while Marc rushes to her rescue. Meanwhile, Detective Mills is watching surveillance of Sofia's visit earlier in the front office and he notices Sofia looking at something. As he went to get coffee in the front office, he realizes she analyzed Marc's wanted poster and makes his way to her apartment. As a fight ensues, Marc takes out Radic's men, while Sofia initially holds her own despite her seeming disadvantage. Radic quickly gets the upper hand and prepares to kill Sofia, until Sofia reaches a piece of broken mirror and moves to impale Radic's neck with it. However, just then Marc barges in and shoves Radic out the window. Radic falls onto a spiked fence, where he's impaled and dies.
As Sofia tends to Marc's wounds, there is a final revelation; Sofia was never blind and could see the whole time. Flashbacks show that during the massacre of her family, her blind sister was the one who was killed while they were hiding. Sofia, real name Balma, took her deceased sister's identity and feigned blindness for years. Because she could see, she saw a "Wanted Poster" and realizes that Marc is a wanted fugitive. The film ends as Marc encourages her to run, while he takes the fall for Radic's death, and Sofia flees the apartment.
Production.
Sofia is depicted as living in Maida Vale, London, where scenes were shot for the film, including a flower shop on Lauderdale Road which was converted to act as a café. Sofia and Veronique's building is located in Bramham Gardens, Kensington. Other filming locations included Brompton Cemetery, Ealing Hospital, the Thames Embankment, New Zealand House and the National Gallery.
Release.
In February 2018, Vertical Entertainment acquired US distribution rights to the film. The film was released on 25 May 2018 in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the film was released on 6 July 2018 by Shear Entertainment.
Reception.
Box office.
In the United Kingdom, the film grossed £1,550 in its opening week from 10 theaters.
Critical response.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 45% based on reviews from 22 critics, with an average rating of 4.8/10. On Metacritic, it has a score of 59 out of 100 based on reviews from seven critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
The film, which features Dormer nude as well as contains a sex scene, has been criticised for what some critics called "gratuitous nudity". Dormer dismissed this in an interview with "The Guardian", saying, "There has to be sexuality in the power play of a thriller. We have all got bodies, after all. In this film the sex scene, which for me was a love-making scene, is a metaphor for the way my character connects with the part played by Ed Skrein. Nakedness is a good equaliser and the shower scene also shows the tattoos on my character's body and makes it clear she is not quite who you think."

Head (Csaky)

Head, also known as Tête d'homme, or Portrait d'homme, is an early Cubist sculpture created in 1913 by the Hungarian avant-garde sculptor Joseph Csaky. This black and white photograph from the Csaky family archives (AC.111) shows a frontal view of the original 1913 plaster. "Head" was exhibited at Galerie , 46, rue Laffitte, Paris, 1913–14, and at the 1914 Salon des Indépendants titled "Tête d'homme" (n. 814 or 815). It was subsequently exhibited at Galerie Moos, Geneva, 1920, titled "Buste".
The work was published in "The Sun" (New York City), 15 March 1914. It was then reproduced in Ricciotto Canudo's Montjoie! "Montparnasse", André Salmon, numéro spécial consacré au XXXème Salon, Artistes Indépendants, 3rd issue, 18 March 1914.
The dimensions and whereabouts of "Tête d'homme" are unknown, and the work is presumed destroyed.
Description.
"Head" is a plaster sculpture carved in a vertical format. The work represents the bust of a man in a highly Cubist syntax, in opposition to the softness and curvilinearity of Nabis, Symbolist or Art Nouveau forms.
Csaky's heads of the period partake in the "stylized, hieratic, nonportrait tradition of tribal and ancient art", writes Edith Balas, "in which there is a total lack of interest in depicting psychological traits". "Head" is testimony to Csaky's early immersion in the Cubist idiom.
The subject is constructed with a grouping of faceted planar forms that together form a tight cohesive structure. The models facial features are simply constructed with only a few surface planes juxtaposed in geometric terms at various angles. Sphericity of the head is broken by angular cuts, forming triangular (ears), rectangles (the nose) and arcs (cheekbones), visible in the photograph. The shoulders and neck form a robust base upon which the head rests. The models hair, while treated almost realistically, are stylized and cut radically at an angle with the forehead. Only one eye is visible.
The treatment of Csaky's "Tête d'homme", as other works by the artist executed between 1910 and 1914, suggest, as Albert Edward Elsen notes, that Csaky had looked not only at Picasso's earlier painting and sculpture, but also at African tribal masks whose exaggerated features and simplified design accommodated the need to be seen at a distance and to evoke strong feeling.
Just as in Csaky's "Groupe de femmes" (1911–12) and "Danseuse" (1912), "Head" already shows a new way of representing the human figure, an unwillingness to revert to classical, academic or traditional methods of representation. The complex angular syntax visible in "Head" was born out of a growing sense of contemporary dynamism, out of rhythm, balance, harmony and out of the powerful geometric qualities of Egyptian art, African art, early Cycladic art, Gothic art, of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Auguste Rodin, Gustave Courbet, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat and Paul Cézanne, all of whom Csaky greatly admired.
Salon des Indépendants, 1914.
At the Salon des Indépendants, held in Paris 1 to 30 March 1914, composed of many Orphist works of large dimension and took place in one of the largest rooms on the ground floor of the at the Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées: Robert Delaunay, Sonia Delaunay, Patrick Henry Bruce and Arthur Burdett Frost were largely represented.
Csaky exhibited "Tête d'homme" (plaster, n. 814 or 815 of the catalog), along with another bust and "Danseuse" (1912), executed in a highly Cubist facture. Several years later, Marcel Duchamp, speaking about his own experience during the revolutionary years in the history of art of the 20th century, presented Joseph Csaky as "belonging to a group of sculptors who, before 1914, imparted a new direction in their work. The theory of Cubism was then a trampoline that permitted the propulsion towards unexplored regions and Csaky, even if influenced by Cubism, developed his own concepts on the treatment of space. His first works appeared more theoretical and intellectual than his later works when he oriented his personal development towards atmospheric structures."
Reviewing the 1914 Indépendants in an article entitled "Le Salon", published in the periodical "Montjoie!" and "Montparnasse", André Salmon, who usually considered works the Indépendants 'true mediocrity' of the pupils of "l'art officiel", encouraged his readers to visit this years salon to discover 'true modernity'. To justify his claim he reproduce a large photograph Csaky's 1913 "Head".

Prince Sanggye

Prince Sanggye or Crown Prince Wanpung (January 21, 1769 - November 20, 1786) was a Korean prince, an adopted son of Jeongjo of Joseon and biological child of Prince Euneon. His first name was Yi Jun (이준 李濬), his changed name was Yi Dam (이담 李湛), and his other name was Yi Shik (이식 李湜). His posthumous epithet is unknown.
Life.
Prince Sanggye was born as Yi Jun, on January 21, 1769, in Hanseong. He was the son of Prince Euneon and his wife, Princess Consort Sangsan of the Jincheon Song clan, a daughter of Song Rak-hyu. His father was the son of Crown Prince Sado and his great-grandfather was Yeongjo of Joseon. During his early childhood, he was adopted by Hong Guk-yeong, the fourth cousin-once-removed of Lady Hyegyeong, as the son of his sister, Royal Noble Consort Won of the Pungsan Hong clan, and King Jeongjo.
At the time, Ku Seon-bok and other Joseon noblemen supported Yi Jun as heir to the throne, but as King Jeongjo was in his mid-20s and could still be expected to produce a child, Kim Jong-su, along with many of Jeongjo's ministers, who were enemies of Hong Guk-yeong, demanded his and Crown Prince Wanpung's removal.
On May 7, 1779, Lady Hong Won-bin of Pungsan suddenly died and the King's ministers repeatedly accused Hong Guk-yeong and the Crown Prince.
On September 26, 1779, Hong Guk-yeong was expelled from power and jailed. Crown Prince Wanpung was dethroned and removed from the peerage. His title was changed from Wanpung to Sanggye and his name was also changed from Yi Jun to Yi Dam, but the King's retainers continued their attacks.
On January 21, 1784, he was married to Lady Shin of Pyeongsan, a daughter of Shin Oh.
On November 20, 1786, Prince Sanggye suddenly died and it's suspected to have been poisoned. Some accused Hong Guk-yeong or his biological father, Prince Euneon, and others accused some of King Jeongjo's retainers. After his death, he was buried at Yeonhul Castle, near modern Sinchon Station and Yonsei University. His funeral was personally arranged by his adoptive father, Jeongjo of Joseon.
Prince Sanggye was not reinstated for many years. In 1801, his mother, Princess Consort Sangsan, and his wife, Princess Consort Shin, were executed for their belief in Catholicism (Neo-Confucianism was the state religion of the Joseon Dynasty). 
He was eventually amnestied and rehabilitated on June 17, 1849, by King Cheoljong, who was his half-nephew.

Ksenia Aleksandrovna Razumova

Ksenia Aleksandrovna Razumova ("Ксения Александровна Разумова" in Russian; also transliterated Xenia Razumova) (January, 1931) is a Russian physicist. She graduated from the Physical Faculty of Moscow University in 1955 and took a position at the then called Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy in Moscow, then USSR. She defended her Ph.D. in 1966, was Candidate in Physical and Mathematical sciences in 1967, and became Doctor of Sciences in 1984. She is laboratory head at the Institute of Nuclear Fusion, Russian Research Centre Kurchatov Institute. Since the beginning she is actively involved plasma physics in research on the tokamak line of Magnetic confinement fusion.
Selected work.
Razumova is best known for her early experimental research in the tokamak line. 
Inspired by the theoretical work of Vitaly Shafranov, she developed a macroscopically stable plasma in the tokamak TM-2 in 1963., opening the way to a world-wide shift of the nuclear fusion programme towards the tokamak line.
Experiments carried out by her at this tokamak, along with results obtained on the T-3 and T-4 tokamaks, convinced the scientific community that the pessimistic forecasts for the future of magnetic confinement based on the Bohm formula were unfounded. In 1971, she was awarded the USSR State Prize for creating and investigating high temperature thermonuclear plasmas in tokamaks. Her work contributed to the very fast development of the tokamak line in the 1970s.
She was a pioneer on the study of MHD instabilities and disruptions in tokamaks. In 1962, she and her colleagues were the first to observe the disruption instability in a tokamak.
She was the first to implement a method to measure the plasma energy based on the diamagnetic effect, still in use these days.
With V. Alikaev, she demonstrated plasma heating by Electron Cyclotron in the TM-3 tokamak. Her team also investigated runaway electrons in tokamaks.
Since the mid 1980s her interest has shifted to investigation on plasma transport, in particular to the study of profile consistency and plasma self-organization.
She is as active now as she was in her younger years, and is always eager to discuss new ideas and experiments.

Simon Charlie

Simon Charlie or Hwunumetse' (1919–2005) was a Canadian totem sculptor of the Cowichan Tribes "(Quw'utsun)" of the Coast Salish nation, known for his wood carvings. He was born in Koksilah, on Vancouver Island, close to Duncan, British Columbia.
He was trained by famous Kwakwaka'wakw totem artist Henry Hunt, at the Provincial Museum of British Columbia, but though as Hunt he carved Totem poles, which was not traditionally used by the Coast Salish people (who usually carved mainly house posts with human figures), Charlie worked in the Salish carving tradition rather than Hunt's Kwakwaka'wakw tradition. He was described as having "deep knowledge of the language, history, oral traditions, and ceremonial practices" of the Cowichan people. Though he was known for his adherence to the Coast Salish traditional aesthetic, he was also known for his insistence on experimenting with new forms of expression. He has been described as having contributed to a revival of Coast Salish artistic tradition. A certain adzed texture is characteristic of Charlie's artistic style. Charlie described how his knowledge of oral tradition of the Hul'qumi'num language of the Cowichan tribe inspired him to design his totem poles - for example the choice of an eagle with a dog salmon on top of a bear with atraditional Salish "Swaixwhe " mask for his totem pole at Qualicum beach.
He also trained several other Coast Salish artists including Jane Martson, Luke Marston and John Marston. He was the father of Cowichan elder Arvid Charlie "Luschiim".
He was awarded many prizes for his work, including the Canadian Centennial Medal (1967), the Order of British Columbia (2001) and the Order of Canada (2003). Much of his work was totem poles, and they are exhibited in museums such as the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria, and in the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa. Several of his totem poles are in the Totem Pole collection of the City of Duncan, including three at the centre court of the Duncan Mall. Many other pieces are found in museums and private collections in the US, Europe and Australia.

From the manga also two animated films were made: "21 Emon: Uchū e Irasshai!" and "21 Emon: Uchū Ike! Hadashi no Princess". The official English name is 21 Emon: The 21st Century Kid.
The manga, set in a science fiction 2018, tells the story of 18-year-old 21 Emon, heir to a long dynasty of hotel owners, whose ancestor goes back to the Tokugawa shogunate. The anime, unlike the manga, is set between 2051 and 2071.
The robot character Gonsuke would go on to make numerous cameo appearances in the 2005 "Doraemon" series.
Plot.
Manga.
Having to struggle with keeping up their family hotel business at the age of 18, 21 Emon is trying his hardest to help out his family as the new heir, although his dream is not being in the hotel business his whole life but exploring the wide space as a space pilot.
Anime.
The plot is the same as the manga, but with changes. Although 21 Emon is 18 in the manga, he is around 11–13 years old in the anime adaptation.

Maki Ikeda

 is a Japanese politician of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and a member of the House of Representatives in the Diet (national legislature). Ikeda represents Hokkaido through the Hokkaido PR block.
Biography.
Ikeda was born in Itabashi, Tokyo in 1972. Her childhood was marred by abuse from her father, which led her family to disintegrate by the time she was in middle school. Ikeda studied up to second year of high school before dropping out as she was unable to pay for her tuition.
In 1995, she trained as a caregiver and then worked at the Itabashi welfare office. Later in 1997, she enrolled in a Tokyo vocational school and received a qualification in welfare. She worked in the office until 2011, when she moved to Hokkaido to head an NGO focusing on rebuilding the lives of welfare recipients and pensioners. Several years after settling in Hokkaido, she entered Hokkaido University as a mature student and took a postgraduate course in Public Policy. She graduated in March 2015.
Ikeda first ran for public office in the 2014 general election. She ran as an independent candidate for the Hokkaido 2nd district seat with the support of the centre-left Democratic Party of Japan, finishing in the third place. She would then become the official opposition candidate for the neighbouring Hokkaido 5th district seat in the 2016 by-election, but lost narrowly to the LDP candidate Yoshiaki Wada. Ikeda ran again for the seat in the 2017 general election. She narrowly lost her rematch with Wada but obtained enough votes to be returned through the CDP's PR block list.
Ikeda is a single mother with two adult children.

Rwanda Women Parliamentary Forum

The Rwanda Women Parliamentary Forum (; FFRP) is a cross-party women’s caucus aimed at uniting women in the Rwandan parliament towards common goals, and championing gender equality interests at the legislative level. Founded in 1996, the FFRP’s specific objectives include building solidarity among female members of parliament (MPs) regardless of differing party ideologies, supporting women in parliament to get involved in the revision or repeal of laws that discriminate against women, and to raise awareness among other MPs, as well as public and private institutions, about the importance of gender equality. Their motto is “solidarity, women's empowerment and equality”. 
The FFRP is a part of Rwanda's national gender machinery. It advocates that all national laws and policies give consideration to gender issues, including the country's national budget. The FFRP also works to build the capacity of women Parliamentarians, in order to carry out advocacy around gender and development issues, and to successfully manage their other parliamentary duties.
Mission &amp; Vision.
The stated mission of the FFRP is “to contribute to the building of an egalitarian, equitable, inclusive and participatory society, playing the influential role in gender matters in accordance with the Parliament mission”. The stated vision of the FFRP is “A society characterized by unity, equality and equity between men and women”.
Achievements.
Legislative.
The Law on the Prevention and Punishment of Gender-based Violence.
The FFRP was responsible for drafting and introducing the Gender-Based Violence Bill (GBV), a private members bill and the only bill so far, at that point in time, to have originated outside of the executive branch of government. The process of drafting the original bill began in early 2005, when the FFRP mobilized its members and reached out to community leaders across the country to gather information and recommendations from the general population on how to define, prevent and appropriately punish acts of GBV. Following initial community outreach, a mass-media campaign began with the intention of raising awareness and sensitizing the country to the problem of GBV. Later on in the year, female parliamentarians of the FFRP returned to the field again to consult further with communities regarding the bill, and worked in collaboration with NAWOCO to conduct discussion sessions with women only, in addition to the discussions already taking place that involved both women and men. A consultative committee was established involving the Ministry of Gender, the Ministry of Justice, the national police, the legal community and civil society. The “Draft Law on Prevention, Protection and Punishment of Any Gender-Based Violence” was presented to Parliament on August 2, 2006, and after internal deliberation and revision, was passed into law in 2009. Though the deliberation period was longer than desired, the process of drafting the bill was extremely collaborative, and demonstrated the state’s apparent commitment to engaging in a two-way dialogue with civil society about important matters of gender justice.
The Law, also known in short-hand as the GBV law, defines different forms of gender-based violence and the applicable punishment for these crimes; the full text of the law can be accessed online in three different languages (English, French and Kinyarwanda).
Community development.
The FFRP has supported communities in Rwanda through various activities, including donating cows, distributing water tanks to households, planting kitchen gardens, and donating house materials, including schools materials to girls who have dropped out of school. For their 20th anniversary, the FFRP visited Gisagara District as it is one of the most vulnerable districts in Rwanda. Gisagara District is one of 8 districts that have now entered into partnerships with the FFRP since 2011, in terms of economic empowerment efforts for the district's most vulnerable women. The FFRP has also sought collaboration with Gisagara District authorities involving outreach programmes dedicated to helping the local community increase its innovative capacity. 
Women in Rwanda's Parliament.
Rwanda has a bicameral parliament. It consists of two chambers, the Senate (Upper House) and the Chamber of Deputies (Lower House). Rwanda was the first country in the world with a female majority in parliament, currently at 61.3% for the Lower House and 38.5% for the Upper House. Bolivia is currently second to Rwanda for majority of female parliamentarians.

Rhoda Kalema

Rhoda Nakibuuka Nsibirwa Kalema (born May 1929) is a retired Ugandan female politician known as the country's "Mother of Parliament".
Early life.
Rhoda Kalema was one of 24 children of Martin Luther Nsibirwa, who was twice appointed Katikkiro (Prime Minister) of the Kingdom of Buganda in Uganda. She was born in May 1929 in the Butikkiro, the official residence of the Katikkiro, in the Mengo neighbourhood of Kampala.
Kalema attended Gayaza Junior School for a year, and then King's College Budo for the remainder of her primary and secondary schooling. She enrolled for a commercial course in secretarial training, and worked as secretary and bursar at Gayaza High School until 1949. In 1950, she married William Kalema, a teacher at King's College Budo who later became a renowned politician and Government Minister of Commerce. In 1955 she commenced a one year course in Social Work and Social Administration at Newbattle Abbey, an Adult Education College in the United Kingdom, followed by a Diploma in Social Studies at the University of Edinburgh.
Political career.
In 1961, Grace Ibingira and Adoko Nyekon initiated Rhoda Kalema into the Uganda People's Congress. She was a junior minister of Culture and Community Development in Binaisa's regime. However, after the death of her husband in 1972—he was abducted and killed during Idi Amin's regime—she gave up political participation until 1979 when, after Idi Amin's downfall, she joined the National Consultative Council (NCC) formed by the Uganda National Liberation Front under Edward Rugumayo, as one of two female representatives. In 1980 she was one of the founding members of the Uganda Patriotic Movement (UPM).
She was arrested three times by the State Research Bureau: on January 23, 1979; on February 21, 1981 (when she and other politicians were arrested after numerous attacks on police stations) and on February 4, 1983.
She became Deputy Minister of Public Service from 1989 until 1991 under President Yoweri Museveni. In 1994, she stood for the Constituent Assembly elections as the Kiboga representative, and defeated 8 male opponents after scooping two thirds of the entire vote. She later retired from politics after grooming a number of notable politicians such as Ruth Nankabirwa, the Chief Whip in Uganda's Cabinet.
Rhoda Kalema was honoured in 1996 by Uganda's Forum for Women in Democracy "as a transformative leader". On March 13, 2018, she received the Sudreau Global Justice Lifetime Achievement Award from the Pepperdine University School of Law and the Ugandan Judiciary.

HS4Air

HS4Air was a proposal for a high-speed railway line in the United Kingdom, put forward in 2018 by a British engineering consultancy, Expedition Engineering.
The proposed line would have connected the planned High Speed 2 line to the High Speed 1 line via a high-speed route running south of London, and would form a direct rail link between Heathrow and Gatwick airports. The proposal was rejected by government in December 2018 and will not go ahead.
Background.
The first high-speed railway line to be built in the United Kingdom was High Speed 1 (HS1), the route connecting London to the Channel Tunnel, which opened 2003−2007. A second high-speed line named High Speed 2 (HS2), which will initially run between London and Birmingham, is planned to open in 2026.
A proposal to build a direct connection between HS1 and HS2 in central London was dropped from HS2 construction plans in 2014 due to cost and the impact on the London district of Camden. The HS2 plans also included a connection to Heathrow Airport at Heathrow Hub railway station, but that link was dropped in 2015.
A number of other schemes have been considered to create a rail link between Heathrow and Gatwick airports, collectively dubbed "Heathwick".
Planned route.
The proposed line would leave the HS2 line at a junction near Denham in Buckinghamshire, and then run on a route curving south-west of London, partly parallel to the M25 motorway, with stations at Heathrow Airport and Gatwick Airport. It would then head eastwards across Kent using the existing upgraded South Eastern Main Line via to join HS1 at a junction at . The link between HS1 and HS2 would allow high-speed trains to travel directly between regional cities in Great Britain and destinations in Continental Europe.
A fifth of the line was planned to be in tunnel in order to mitigate the environmental impact on sensitive rural areas such as the North Downs. It was also proposed to construct a link with the Great Western Main Line. It would cost £10 billion to build and around 40% of the route would reuse existing tracks; the proposals included upgrades at and stations.
The scheme envisaged a 15-minute transfer time between Heathrow and Gatwick, allowing the two airports to operate jointly as an airline hub. Fast connections between the airports and Birmingham, Manchester and Cardiff were also proposed, and the proponents of the scheme claimed that it would alleviate pressure on transport within London by reducing the need for air passengers to travel through the city.
The scheme was also linked to proposals to re-open Manston Airport in Kent, which could be connected to the line via .
Government response.
Expedition Engineering's proposals were submitted to the Department for Transport (DfT) at the end of July 2018, as part of the Government's plans to encourage private investment. The HS4Air scheme was rejected by Government in December 2018 because the DfT did not consider that Expedition Engineering's proposals were "financially credible without government support", and anticipated public opposition to building the route across green belt land.

Tribofilm

Tribofilms (boundary lubricant films, boundary lubricating films, tribo-boundary films or boundary films) are films that form on tribologically stressed surfaces. Tribofilms are mostly solid surface films that result from a chemical reaction of lubricant components or tribological surfaces.
Tribofilms play an important role in reducing friction and wear in lubricated systems. They form as a result of complex mechanochemical interactions between surface materials and lubricants, and the study of tribofilm formation processes is a major field of tribology.
Generally, a tribofilm is any film that forms in a tribosystem "as a result of interaction between chemical components of the [lubricant] with the lubricated surface". The term is mostly used to describe strongly bound films that are formed on tribologically stressed surfaces, such as tribochemical reaction films (for example produced by ZDDP-containing lubricants) or polymeric and non-sacrificial reaction films (for example formed by complex esters).
While the definition of the term is flexible, it is usually contrasted to weakly bound surface films that may form due to ionic interactions or lubricant adsorption.

Unequal Love

Unequal Love is a circa 1631 painting, by the Dutch Golden Age painter Judith Leyster. It is in the collection of the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome.
The painting shows the theme of the ill-matched couple, a popular theme in the arts of the period, though generally the one making the proposition is a man to a courtesan, not a woman to a man. The theme generally shows the man offering the woman a ring in combination with a purse of money. Earlier examples of Haarlem versions of this that were based on earlier Flemish examples are:
This painting certainly fits in that tradition, unlike Leyster's much more ambiguous "The Proposition", also dated the same year. Here a man is sitting sideways on a simple wooden chair with his legs crossed playing the lute. He turns his head to the spectator. Behind him an older woman grasps a money purse with one hand and offers the musician a ring with the other. Both are dressed in simple peasant clothing, but the table has a second money purse and gold coins are spread out for counting from a money box gleaming with metal decorations that seem to contradict the simple characters in the scene. On a small three-legged stool a candlestick rests, but there is no candle in it. It lines up with a pile of coins as if to imply that instead of the "fire of love" there is money to be had for the taking.
The pose of the man leaning over the back of a chair is a common pose used by Leyster's master Frans Hals, and the crossed legs of the musician can be seen in the work of Leyster's future husband Jan Miense Molenaer. Perhaps the lute was his or hers as it features in works by both of them.
Former title "The Luteplayer".
The painting was catalogued by Juliane Harms in 1937 as "Lautenspieler" (luteplayer). She classified it as one of Leyster's "intimate" portraits. The informal pose of the musician does suggest intimacy, especially considering that the female figure was not visible at all when Harms saw the picture. The woman was only resurrected during restoration after WWII. The Bildindex still has an image of the painting in its pre-restoration state.

British football clubs tours to South America

British football clubs tours over South America contributed to the spread and develop of football in the region during the first years of the 20th century. The first club to tour on the region was Southampton F.C. in 1904, followed by several teams (mainly from England although some Scottish clubs also visited South America) until 1929 with Chelsea F.C. being the last team to tour.
During those 25 years of tours, British teams' performances were decreasing while the South American squads' style of playing improved. Indeed, Southampton won all of their matches in 1904 with 40 goals scored in 1904 while Chelsea was defeated eight times (over 16 games played) in their 1929 tour.
Background.
Football (and other British-origin sports like rugby union) were gaining popularity in Argentina and Uruguay and the associations brought foreign teams to their countries as a way of encourage the practise of the sport among the large number of enthusiasts. In fact, Argentine Primera División was the first football league outside of the British Isles, having been held since 1891 to the present.
British teams were considered the best in the world by then, and some of them served as inspiration to establish football clubs in Argentina and Uruguay, helped by the immigration of British citizens that had arrived to worked for British companies (mostly in railway construction). CURCC (in Uruguay), Belgrano A.C., Rosario A.C., Alumni and Quilmes (in Argentina) are some examples of clubs established by British immigrants to South America.
Football had been introduced many years ago in both countries, being the first game played in Argentina on June 20, 1867, with the establishment of Buenos Aires Football Club, the first football club not only in Argentina but in South America. In Uruguay, football had been introduced in 1870. Argentina organised its first league championship, Primera División, in 1891 while its Uruguayan homonymous held its first championship in 1900.
Both countries considered themselves rivals due to their proximity. Moreover, they had the only organised bodies in South America and had held some earlier competitions such as Tie Cup (1900) or Copa de Honor Cousenier (1905), played by champions of each association.
In some cases, the influence of British clubs on Argentine football extended to the colours adopted by some clubs. Arístides Langone, president of Club Atlético Independiente, was so impressed by the Nottingham Forest squad that beat local Alumni by 6–0 that he suggested to change the jersey colours from white and blue to red. The request was approved and Independiente adopted the colour that would later become an identity mark for the club, being known as "El Rojo (The Red)".
Some versions also state that Quilmes A.C. was another institution that took the colours from a British squad, in this case the white jersey with blue details of the English national team, although there is no evidence to prove that statement.
Tours.
Southampton F.C. was the first foreign club to tour South America, followed by Nottingham Forest F.C. in 1905. One of its games, against Alumni in Buenos Aires, was attended by 10,000 spectators, what proves the interest of Argentine fans to see the local forces facing British sides, considered technically superior by them.
The first team to defeat a British side was Argentine Alumni, who defeated the South Africa team (mostly composed of British–origin players) by 1–0 at Sociedad Sportiva Argentina stadium in Palermo. The relevance of the victory was expressed by local media, such as "La Nación" writing: "For our national football, the Alumni v South Africa match was a great triumph that will be remembered for a long time in everyone's memory, serving as example and stimulus for the future", while British-origin newspaper "The Standard" wrote "it was a glorious victory and what happened in La Sportiva is promising for Argentine football".
Corinthian F.C. of London was the first British club to tour Brazil in 1910, playing ten games in the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. The team inspired a group of railway workers to establish a club which they named after the British team, therefore S.C. Corinthians was founded in September 1910.
Corinthian F.C. would return to Brazil in 1913, becoming the only British team that toured South America twice.
Exeter City was the first British team to play beyond Argentina and Uruguay when they reached Brazil to play a series of friendly matches in Rio de Janeiro (most of them v. local combined teams), finishing their tour on July 21, 1914, when Exeter played Brazil national team, in which was the first match ever played by the "scratch".
Nevertheless, newspapers in Argentina were left disappointed with City's performances during the tour. "Tribuna" describing them as ""the most mediocre team of professionals sent out by the FA from the home of football", and the "Buenos Aires Herald" complaining that the Grecians were not "sufficiently superior"".
Plymouth Argyle thrashed the Uruguay national team 4–0 in their first game (Uruguay went on to win the first ever World Cup just six years later) before pulling off another shock by beating Argentina 1–0. Plymouth Argyle was the team that faced Argentina most times, with 4 matches played between both squads.
In the match against Boca Juniors on 9 July 1924, the Boca Juniors supporters invaded the pitch after their team had scored the opening goal and carried all eleven home players shoulder high around the stadium. After a half hour delay, the referee restarted the match, but a further invasion was sparked when the referee awarded a penalty against the home side. When the match was again restarted, the Argyle players had agreed that Patsy Corcoran would take the spot-kick and miss, to prevent another pitch invasion. However, the ultra-competitive Russell was not prepared to accept this, and just before Corcoran was about to take the penalty he was pushed aside by Russell who took it himself and scored. This prompted a further pitch invasion by the Boca fans and this time the match was abandoned.
Chelsea F.C. was the last British club to tour South America, in 1929. Since the first tour in 1904, the South American players had evolved a lot, as they were described as "true masters in tactical play" by Chelsea chairman Kirby himself. He also remarked the style and ball control on offer, perhaps a consequence of the outstanding sporting facilities many of the amateur teams possessed. The evolution of South American football was also evident in the tour results: of 16 games played during their three months tour, Chelsea only won five, with eight loses. On the other hand, the Chelsea players emphasised the "unfair play" of some Argentine players and the violent surrounding atmosphere of the supporters in Argentina. The Chelsea management complained to the Football Association that "non-observance of the laws of the game hindered real football".
Some players that were part of British teams touring South America, would then hired as coaches in the continent. Walter Bull of Totenham Hotspur went to Argentina, John Harley to Uruguay (he died there in 1959) while John Hamilton went to Brazil in 1907, becoming the first professional coach in the country.

Jeff Erlanger

Jeffrey Clay Erlanger (November 30, 1970 – June 10, 2007) was an American advocate and activist for disability rights. He is known for appearing on "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" when he was 10 years old, talking about his electric wheelchair and why he needed it.
Erlanger's philosophy was summarized in a 2002 Wisconsin Public Television ad: "It doesn't matter what I can't do—what matters is what I can do."
Early life and education.
Jeffrey Clay Erlanger was born in Madison, Wisconsin, on November 30, 1970 to Howard and Pam Erlanger, joining his older sister, Lisa. His father is a professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison School of Law. When Erlanger was 7 months old, he was diagnosed with a spinal tumor. Surgery was used to remove it, but he was left as a quadriplegic. He received his first electric wheelchair when he was 4 years old. He required many additional surgeries while growing up. 
Erlanger graduated from Memorial High School and from Edgewood College with a degree in political science.
"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood".
Before Erlanger underwent spinal surgery at age 5, his parents asked him what he wanted. He said he wanted to meet "Mister Rogers". His sister wrote Fred Rogers about her brother's wishes. Rogers happened to be traveling to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, so the Erlangers drove to meet him for breakfast in a restaurant. Several years later, Erlanger was invited to be on Rogers' show.
Erlanger appeared in Season 11, Episode 4 (#1478), which aired on February 18, 1981. The ten-year-old showed Rogers how his electric wheelchair worked and explained why he needed it. They talked about his parents, doctors, recent surgery and what you can do when you're sad. Together they sang one of Rogers' popular songs, "It's You I Like". The two of them continued to communicate. In speeches Rogers gave, he told of Erlanger's example of "overcoming obstacles and feeling comfortable about yourself."
Career.
Political career and activism.
Erlanger worked as an intern for Representative Tammy Baldwin and Senator Russ Feingold, who honored Erlanger in the Senate. Erlanger became very active in Madison, Wisconsin municipal politics, holding a number of positions in the community including as a member of the Economic Development Commission, chair of the Commission on People with Disabilities, and chair of the Board of Directors of the Community Living Alliance. In 2002, he ran for the Madison Common Council for the 8th District. He helped gain the accessible taxicab service in Madison today.
In 2004 Erlanger flew to Boston to attend the Democratic National Convention, although he did not have a ticket. Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk, whose campaign Erlanger had worked on, was on his flight and got him in. Falk said after his death, "Jeff was passionate about our nation on a big-scale level and equally passionate about our community," adding, "This is a man who devoted so many countless hours to making things better for other people."
In February 2000 Erlanger made a random connection in an America Online chat room at the end of the day with a woman in Boston who said she was trying to kill herself. She said she had "cut herself and blood was going down her arms." Unsure if it was a hoax, Erlanger decided to take action, but his phone was in use with the computer modem. He went to his building's lobby to call the police in Madison and Boston, and then AOL to help with the rescue. Boston police found the woman, who had fresh cuts on her wrist, and took her to a hospital for medical treatment.
When Rogers was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1999, Erlanger was a surprise guest to introduce him. Rogers left his seat onto the stage when Erlanger appeared.
In May 2003, Erlanger attended the memorial service for Rogers in Pittsburgh to honor him. 
Erlanger's appearance on Rogers' show is featured in the 2018 PBS special "Mister Rogers: It's You I Like". The special's host and former crew member, Michael Keaton, recalled Rogers saying his most treasured moment on the show was with Erlanger. Erlanger's parents were interviewed in the 2018 documentary film "Won't You Be My Neighbor?".
Death and legacy.
After Erlanger choked on some food, he fell into a coma for three weeks before dying on Sunday, June 10, 2007. He donated his organs. Debbie Friedman sang at his memorial service.
After his death, the City of Madison Common Council created the annual Jeffrey Clay Erlanger Civility In Public Discourse Award in his honor. Recipients include Torrie Kopp Mueller for efforts to eliminate racism, empower women, and decriminalize homelessness; William Greer, president and CEO of Journey Mental Health Center; Leslie Ann Howard, United Way's president and CEO; and Nan Brian, whose career has served children.

Battle of An Bao

The Battle of An Bao took place from 5-6 May 1968 in Bình Định Province during the Vietnam War when elements of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 3rd Division ambushed a unit of the 1st Battalion, 50th Infantry Regiment (Mechanized).
Background.
As part of the May Offensive, PAVN General Chu Huy Mân Commander of Military Region 5 ordered the 3rd Division to attack the 1/50th Infantry in Bình Định Province with a series of large-scale ambushes. The 1/50th Infantry was based at Landing Zone Uplift, 8 kilometres north of the town of Phù Mỹ.
Battle.
On the morning of 5 May, the 3rd Division attacked Landing Zone Salem (), 5 kilometres north of LZ Uplift, and Landing Zone Ollie () a further 3 kilometres north. The commander of the 1/50th Infantry, Lt. Col. John B. Carter ordered two platoons from Company A, 1/50th Infantry to the village of An Bao, 2 kilometres west of LZ Salem, where signal intercepts indicated a PAVN regimental headquarters might be located. At 08:00 the force of 9 M113s left LZ Uplift and headed north on Highway 1. By 10:00 the force had turned west off Highway 1 towards An Bao and were crossing some dry rice paddies in a clearing when they saw a group of approximately 15 PAVN run into the tree line. The M113s moved into line abreast and fired their machine guns into the tree line but received no return fire. After searching the area the force formed a defensive perimeter and the men ate lunch. As they were preparing to move out, the position was hit by Rocket-propelled grenades (RPG) and recoilless rifle fire which disabled the command and medical vehicles. Mortar rounds and machine gun fire then began to hit the U.S. position. Realizing that they were surrounded, the commander Lieutenant Dennis E. Hinton radioed for support.
The PAVN forces comprising the 97th Battalion, 2nd Regiment, and the 7th and 9th Battalions, 22nd Regiment began closing in on the U.S. position. Two M113s attacked on the PAVN positions but both were soon disabled by RPGs. An M132 Armored Flamethrower was also hit and its fuel tanks caught fire. The remaining 4 M113s and some soldiers on foot retreated through their entry point into the clearing and headed back to Highway 1 leaving behind 15 men in a small perimeter a few hundred metres northwest of the disabled M113s.
On learning of the ambush, Lt. Col Carter ordered Company C, 1/50th Infantry and Company B, 1st Battalion, 69th Armored Regiment with its 7 M48s to go to the assistance of Company A. The 1/69th tanks overshot the turnoff to An Bao by 1.5 kilometres and when they did turn west off of Highway 1, one of the tanks got stuck in the mud, leaving one tank to assist in retrieving the wedged tank, 5 M48s proceeded towards An Bao. Company C reached the ambush site first and entered the clearing as the PAVN were closing in on the 15 men from Company A, the M113s moved in to form and armored perimeter but were soon hit by intense fire that killed and wounded several of the men of Company C. The 5 M48s then arrived in the clearing and the U.S. forces were able to withdraw and regroup while air and artillery strikes hit the clearing and surrounding forest.
At 17:00, a platoon of tanks from Landing Zone English and Company B, 1/50th Infantry, joined the force and the combined force re-entered the clearing to engage the PAVN. Despite the preceding hours of air and artillery strikes heavy fire again met the U.S. force. The previously dry paddyfields were now filling up with water from a dike that had been deliberately opened or destroyed in the bombing and the ground was now too muddy to be crossed. The Americans withdrew to establish a night defense position while air and artillery strikes continued.
At 03:30 on 6 May the PAVN attacked the northwest of the U.S. perimeter with over a hundred soldiers advancing behind a hail of mortar and RPG fire that detonated an ammunition stockpile, injuring several Americans. The assault was beaten back and the PAVN withdrew at 05:00, dragging away their dead and wounded. Three Americans had been killed in the attack.
Later that morning the Americans advanced again on the tree line but the PAVN had left the battlefield and they found only empty bunkers and fighting positions.
Aftermath.
The battle was claimed as a U.S. victory with MACV claiming 117 PAVN were killed with 70 weapons recovered, with 18 Americans killed.

Le Rêve (Detaille)

Le Rêve (, ) is a painting by Édouard Detaille created in 1888. It won the gold medal at the Salon in 1888.
Description.
"Le Rêve" is a painting depicting the military - the specialty of its creator, Édouard Detaille. It shows an encampment of sleeping French soldiers that continues as far as the eye can see. The soldiers are young conscripts of the French Third Republic who are taking part in summer exercises, probably in Champagne. They are dreaming of the glory of their predecessors, and of exacting revenge following their country's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. 
In a patriotic allegory, French soldiers from previous battles are depicted in the sky above in an intentionally indistinct way. They include soldiers from the French Revolutionary Army, as well as those involved in the battles of Austerlitz, Trocadero, Magenta and Solferino, the invasion of Algiers and the defeats at Gravelotte and Reichshoffen in 1870. 
This type of painting corresponds well with the sentiment of the time, evoking nostalgia for a unified, victorious France, and acting as a memento of a mythical France that was edging further into the past. For Detaille, creating this painting was to "take a direct political position", showing his support for nationalist general Georges Boulanger, as well as celebrating the army.

Battle of Kaukaba

Battle of Kaukaba was a skirmish that took place on May 9, 1978 when PLO soldiers attacked Norwegian peacekeepers. The battle took place only a few days after the first Norwegian troops arrived in Lebanon. The Norwegian military released the sound recordings from the battle in 2008.
The skirmish is regarded as one of the hardest battles fought by Norwegian soldiers in the UNIFIL force, and the PLO soldiers got as close as 30 meters. Throughout the skirmish, the Norwegians fired about 200 machine gun shots, 50 shots from automatic weapons and two Carl Gustav RFK grenades. The PLO fired about ten times more shots from hand weapons, as well as eight gun grenades. Eventually the PLO gave up, and pledged not to fire at the Norwegians again. One Norwegian suffered light injuries during the attack. Official PLO casualties were one dead and one wounded. The Norwegian soldiers believed the real number of Palestinians dead to be closer to eight.

Kathryn B. H. Clancy

Kathryn Bridges Harley Clancy is an American biological anthropologist who specialises in reproductive health. She is Associate Professor at the University of Illinois, in the Department of Anthropology. Her additional research and policy advocacy work focuses on sexual harassment in science and academia.
Education.
Clancy graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree cum laude from Harvard University in 2001, specialising in Biological Anthropology and Women's Studies. She obtained her PhD in Anthropology from Yale University in 2007.
Career and research.
In 2006, Clancy worked as a lecturer at Yale University. One year later, she joined Harvard University as Preceptor Faculty and Associate at the Department of Anthropology. She has worked at the University of Illinois since 2008, where she started as a lecturer and now works as an Associate Professor in Anthropology. Clancy currently leads the Clancy Lab group within the Laboratory for Evolutionary Endocrinology at the University of Illinois. She is also Co-Director of the Laboratory.
Since September 2016, Clancy has hosted the Period Podcast, where she discusses issues regarding the science of menstrual cycles. This theme is connected to her early research.
Fertility research.
Clancy's fertility research focuses on menstruation and variability in endometrial function. Clancy's early published research demonstrated that, contrary to previous belief, menstruation does not increase risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Instead, Clancy and colleagues show that a thicker endometrium is associated with greater iron reserves amongst healthy women. Clancy's later studies focus on rural Polish populations. Clancy explores potential variation amongst endometrial function, or the functions of the inner mucous membrane layer of the uterus. Her research finds that endometrial thickness is negatively correlated over the latter phase of the menstrual cycle (the luteal phase).
Clancy's research contributes to understandings of fertility variation amongst normal, premenopausal Western women. For example, Swedish women appear to show an increase in endometrial thickness in the early part of the luteal phase, while for Canadian and English women, patterns appear largely stable at similar times. Canadian and Swedish women's endometrial thickness drops at other times, and while for Scottish sample, there is an increase. Clancy and colleagues' research suggests that endometrial thickness should be measured daily to better capture and study this variation.
Clancy has also made a broader contribution to the study of human evolutionary biology and ecological stress on ovaries and endometrial function. She finds that immune stress and psychosocial stress impacts on the endometrium's ability to carry a fetus through the mechanism of inflammation.
Clancy's later research focuses on primate development. She has also dispelled the myth that women's menstrual cycles can become synchronised due to their close social bonds.
Sexual harassment research.
Clancy is part of a team of anthropologists who led the "Survey of Academic Field Experiences" study, also known as SAFE13. The study, co-authored with Robin G. Nelson, Julienne N. Rutherford and Katie Hinde, analysed experiences of sexual harassment and sexual assault in scientific fieldwork sites. The study found the majority of researchers had been exposed to, or experienced, sexual harassment, especially women and junior scientists.
A follow-up study (known as "SAFE 2"), led by Nelson, Rutherford, Hinde and Clancy identified systemic patterns that lead to negative fieldwork experiences and harassment. Field sites that have clear codes of conduct and consequences for behaviour are less likely to lead to sexual harassment. Where problems arise, these sites deal with issues swiftly and consistently, leading to higher levels of perceived safety and equality. In fieldwork sites where clear rules and consequences do not exist or are ambiguous, leaders do not take action against harassment. This leads to ongoing alienation and professional retaliation.
The SAFE13 study and subsequent research and activities (media interviews, conferences and advocacy) have made significant impact on increasing awareness of institutional responses to sexual harassment, as well as policy reform. On 27 February 2018, Clancy, provided testimony to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing on sexual harassment in science. Clancy testified that creating a safe, harassment-free workplace culture was imperative to improving science.
Racism and gender harassment.
In 2017, Clancy led another study on sexual harassment in collaboration with Katharine M. N. Lee, Erica M. Rodgers and Christina Richey. The research involved an online survey of 474 astronomers and planetary scientists. It is the first study of its kind in the physical sciences, and it is the first large study to examine both gender and racial harassment in academic science.
The study finds that 88% of participants had heard negative language at work, along with other verbal and physical abuse that made them feel unsafe. Women of colour, however, experienced the greatest level of hostility due to their race and gender. They experienced greater incidents of gendered and racialised harassment and were more attuned to noticing other forms of harassment such as homophobia. Forty percent of women of colour feel unsafe at work due to their gender or sex, and 28% due to their race. Women of colour are also more likely to skip educational and professional opportunities, such as meetings and conferences, in an attempt to minimise exposure to hostility and harassment.
The study received wide media coverage, as it provided evidence on how harassment limits women's career outcomes, especially for racial minority women. Clancy also noted that the study unearths how survivors are re-traumatised by existing reporting systems that have no intermediary level of support in between staying silent and launching a formal report. The study has been commended for showing how racial discrimination compounds experiences of sexual harassment. The study also shows that the impact of harassment contributes to a higher loss of women of colour in science relative to White women scientists. The study raises questions about bystander interventions, given the hostile culture towards women of colour is evident to witnesses, who do not feel empowered to act.
Clancy served on the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's 2018 consensus report entitled "Sexual Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture, and Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine."

Inspiration.
She has been inspired by their former housemaid who got a little help of tailoring training from Ruzibuka's mother and now she has become a big and known entrepreneur in Tanzania.
Ruzibuka believes that many women are still in poverty not because they don't have the capacity to work, but because they didn't get the education and materials they needed. Some lack simple tailoring machines, others don't have the capital to start small businesses. This is the reason behind the name Ki-pepeo (a Kiswahili word meaning "butterfly" in English), referring to the process of transformation from an rather unattractive caterpillar to a beautiful butterfly.

Munich Fire Department

The Munich Fire Department (German: "Feuerwehr München") is the firefighting authority (called "Branddirektion") of the City of Munich. The Munich fire department is divided into a professional department with approximately 1500 fire fighters staffing a total of 10 fire stations (German: "Feuerwache") located strategically throughout the city to meet the legal aid period of 10 Minutes, and a volunteer fire department, whose approximately 1,050 members are organized in 22 companies. Each year, the Munich Fire Department responds to about 80,000 calls (of which are about 70% medical calls). The volunteers respond to about 3,500 calls annually. This makes the Munich Fire Department the third largest fire department as well as the largest municipal fire department in Germany.
History.
Precursor.
As with most fire departments in Germany, the first units were founded by gymnastics clubs. In 1848, a gymnastics club volunteered itself as gymnastics fire department to serve the city. Due to the overall political situation (revolution 1848) and the generally prevailing reservations against clubs, this dissolved again in 1850.
Founding.
After several attempts, especially in the 1860s, which failed mainly du to financial reasons, the volunteer fire department Munich was founded on 10 September 1866 through the work of Julius Knorr, J. B. Sartorius and city architect Arnold Zenetti. A major fire accident on 9 July 1866 in house No. 10 on the Schützenstraße (today Dachauer Straße 40) and the noted lack of necessary push ladders were the most serious argument that forced the city to action. The first commander was the master builder, Reinhold Hirschberg. At that time, seven fire stations were available within the city.
To 1900.
Through the incorporation of neighboring communities (today's districts), Munich grew steadily, and with it the fire brigade. To which, for example, in 1877 Sendling became part of the state capital. The already existing fire brigades were integrated into the Munich fire department as so-called companies (Sendling VI Company) (see also the section Sendling, below). As early as 1870, due to the rapidly growing population, a permanent night watch was set up in Munich and assigned to the volunteer fire department. Eight years later, the city of Munich decided to set up a permanent guard watch. Therefore, the Munich professional fire brigade was founded on 1 July 1879, their former main watch station was housed at Heumarkt (later St.-Jakobs-Platz).
1900 to 1945.
In 1904, the professional fire department moved into the new and still existing main fire station on Blumenstraße (today An der Hauptfeuerwache). By the end of 1913, all horse teams were abolished at the Munich Fire Department and it completely switched to vehicles with gasoline engines. This made Munich the first city to fully automate its fire department fleet. In the course of the motorization, thirteen companies of the volunteer fire brigade were merged into 6 sections. By the end of 1921, the volunteer fire department had 471 active members.
Between the war years, other communities around Munich were incorporated and their fire brigades were incorporated into the Munich volunteer fire department. Creating only one volunteer fire department in Munich, which maintained several locations. Before the Second World War, the volunteer fire department had a staff of 1300 man.
After 1945.
The dense network of firefighting squads of the volunteer fire department, which was created in the city center before the Second World War, was dissolved by the occupying powers, for example the Firefighting squad 3 / company 6 (Firefighting Squad Laim). It was not until 1947 that the reconstruction of the professional fire brigade was possible. As a result, some departments were directly re-established (more or less continued) others, for example, the abbot Waldtrudering (1957) was rebuilt much later. Also new departments emerged such as Sendling (see below) or the Department Center (1967 founded as the firefighting squad city center), which replaced existing units from before the war or restructured them.
In 1972, through the course of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, the silent alarm was introduced, until that time the volunteer fire department was alerted through a siren on the roofs of the fire stations. Since the 1990s, the volunteer fire department is alerted to all emergency operations (in which the statutory auxiliary period applies) simultaneously with the professional fire department.
In the late 1970s, a novel type of aerial ladder was developed in a cooperation between the Munich Fire Department and the fire engine manufacturer Magirus-Deutz, the so-called low-profile design. The series of vehicles built and ordered by the Munich Fire Department in 1980, in 12 different styles, had a height of only 2.85 meters and was therefore significantly lower than conventional turntable ladders with heights between 3.20 and 3.30 meters. As a result, it was possible to reach low gateways and backyards, for which conventional turntable ladders were too high. A vehicle width of only 2.40 meters also provided for more maneuverability.
At the end of the 1980s, all firefighting squads and half-firefighting squads of the Munich volunteer fire department were renamed into departments, such as firefighting squad Michaeliburg into Michaeliburg Department. With the procurement of the 21 LF 16/12, a separate vehicle was procured for the FF for the first time, which could also be used alone for a first strike by fire or THL missions. In 2010, a total of 58 uniform aid firefighting vehicles 20/16 were procured for the volunteer and professional fire departments in Munich.
Future.
The partly from the 1970s originating fire stations and fire department houses are to be overtaken in the course of an extensive renovation program. In addition, urgently needed new buildings, for example, Fire Station 4 (see also Fire Station 4, below) will be built. Due to the fast-growing areas to the west of Munich and the unfavorable situation of several stations, there will be a total of five new fire stations built in Munich. Since two existing stations are to be decided, it is expected that as of 2020, there will be a total of 12 sites of the professional fire department in the city area.
Professional fire department.
The main burden of the missions is taken over by the Munich professional fire department. This consists of about 1,700 fire department officials. Every day, 300 officials at the ten fires and nine emergency medical watch stations are on 24-hour shifts and in constant alert. They attend to almost 5,000 firefighting missions, 21,000 technical assistance missions and more than 55,000 rescue operations per year. In addition, numerous missions and work from special groups, who are also recruited by the professional fire department. These groups come, for example, from the areas of water rescue, environmental protection, altitude rescue, emergency medical services, civil and disaster control, and the prevention of danger. In addition, the professional fire department operates an emergency pressure chamber and has also equipped each of its rescue fire trucks for use as a first-responder vehicle.
In Munich, the professional fire department maintains ten fire stations, which are spread over the entire city and in which the special units are housed. In addition to the tasks of defensive fire protection, the remaining approximately 600 officials who do not work in shifts (so-called day service officials), in addition to administrative service and working in their own workshops, meet the tasks and activities of preventive fire protection.
Standard Firefighting-Convoy.
The firefighting-platoon of the Munich fire department consists of a command vehicle (German: Einsatzleitwagen), two Munich fire and rescue engines (German: Hilfeleistungslöschfahrzeug), an aerial ladder (German: Drehleiter mit Korb), and an ambulance (German: Rettungswagen). Each firefighting-platoon is staffed with minimum 18 firefighters (1 platoon chief, 1 chief assistant, 2 captains, 3 engine operators and 11 firefighters). This Firefighting-platoon forms the basic unit for fighting structural fires in Munich.
Fire Station 1 - Main Fire Station /Fire Department.
Main fire station () was inaugurated on 11 July 1904 as a replacement for the too small central fire houses, which were used for 25 years by the professional fire department. Their appearance was, apart from minor renovations, not changed to this date. The main fire station is also the home of the fire department of the county administrative department and also the fire station (FW) 1. This is the responsibility of the professional fire department, the volunteer fire department, the disaster and civil defense in the city of Munich. In addition, the fire department also works out deployment plans and release order, distributes resources to the stations in the city, manages the integrated control center (ILSt), decides on hiring, procurement of input material and the maintenance of the fire stations. Furthermore, it is active in preventive fire and danger protection and does the administrative work.
At the main fire station, a special extinguishing agent vehicle (SLF) is stationed next to the fire engine. Here are also the leading vehicles of the inspection service, including the service of the directorate as well as the head of the organization and the emergency response service. Also, the children's NEF, and the newborn ambulance are housed here. The station is also assigned to an ambulance, which is not stationed at the fire station, but in the inner-city hospital.
Since 1979, the public fire department museum Munich has been located in the service building.
Fire Station 2 – Sendling.
Fire station 2 () was put into operation in the fall of 1967, after the old fire station 2 on Boschetsrieder Straße had become too small and could no longer meet the growing demands. The fire station is attached to a respiratory protection and a hoses repair shop as well as the fire department school. In particular, the inspection and maintenance of respiratory protective equipment, hoses, jump rescue equipment, fire department fabric and protective clothing is carried out by this fire station. The fire department school has its own fleet, an exercise hall and a fire simulation system (gas-fired).
Currently in Sendling in addition to a fire engine, a device car respiratory/radiation protection, an environment rescue vehicle, a hoses truck 2000, a tank fire engine 24/48, an aerial ladder 37 and two hookloaders are stationed. The vehicles of the Analytical Task Force are also located here. The station is also assigned an emergency ambulance vehicle, which is not stationed at the fire station, but at Klinikum Großhadern.
Fire Station 3 – Westend.
Fire station 3 in Westend () opened on 28 October 1983, replacing the old fire stations 3 and 8, which were each occupied by a group, as a new fire station 3, in which an engine is housed. The fire station 3 is located in the immediate vicinity of Theresienhöhe and Theresienwiese and offers the possibility to strengthen their station at any time. In addition, this station has a large sports hall and a practice tower, and since 1997 an integrated control center. Since then it has been a group station with special vehicles. In 2017, the control center moved to the new FW 4, so that the FW 3 can be "moved" in the long term more in the western direction (Pasing
At present, a Half-platoon (nominal staffing 1/1/10/12), consisting of a command vehicle 1, an aerial ladder with basket 23-12, a rescue fire engine 20/16 and a tank fire engine 24/48 are housed at the fire station. Furthermore, a special extinguisher vehicle, a small alert car and the emergency response vehicle, as well as an ambulance are stationed here. The station is also assigned an emergency ambulance vehicle, which is not stationed at the fire station, but at the Surgical Clinic Munich South (see below: emergency medical service). Furthermore, an ambulance is occupied together with the fire station 7 at the "Klinikum Dritter Orden".
Fire Station 4 – Schwabing.
Fire station 4 Schwabing () was put into service after two years of construction in May 2016. It is located at the Heßstraße 120, on the site of the former Civil Protection Center, in the Munich district of Schwabing-West, but still carries the nickname Schwabing. Construction costs for the new station amounted to 85 million euros and was planned and set up as a large security base in accordance with the "Fire Department Final Plan 2020" (see "future" section). In 2017, the dispatch and control center of fire station 3 moved into the new building. The area of service of fire station 4 includes the city districts Schwabing, Maxvorstadt, Neuhausen, the Englischer Garten, Freimann and parts of the Lehel. In addition to the professional fire department, which is stationed here with two Munich fire and rescue engines, a ladder, an ambulance and a command car, the KLAF and in the future also with the disaster response center, the department City Center (Downtown) of the volunteer fire department Munich and units of civil protection are housed on the site.
The former fire station 4 () was put into operation in 1970. The six-storey building housed until 1984, the garment workshop, which was relocated to Neuperlach due to a lack of space. Since then, the premises have been used as a station and continue to serve as service quarters for the officers. In addition, the station is to serve as an interim location for the fire engine 1 during the renovation work on the fire station 1.
Fire Station 5 – Ramersdorf.
Fire station 5 () of Ramersdorf in the east of Munich was inaugurated in December 1951 and two years later an extension was added to house the vehicle repair shop, which was moved during the construction to Neuperlach. Also, in 1953, an exercise diving tank was built and in 1964 a respiratory workshop was established in Ramersdorf.
The fire station Ramersdorf is the seat of the technical maintenance department and electrical installations, which carry out construction work on the fire stations and houses of the Munich fire department, and the department of extinguishing water supply. This controls all public fire extinguishing water outlets in Munich, as well as dry fire water pipes in U-Bahn and S-Bahn systems and larger structures.
All metrological, medical and respiratory equipment procured by the fire department have been tested and selected in Ramersdorf. In addition, emergency medical and rescue vehicles are disinfected here. Another special feature of this fire station is the overpressure treatment chamber located there, a diver relay which can be brought via helicopters for use, since the sports field belonging to the station is also used as a heliport. As part of the large-scale restructuring and modernization of the Munich Fire Department, the second Civil Protection Center in Munich (next to the new FW 4) is to be built in Ramersdorf.
In addition to the mandatory fire engine in Ramersdorf also a large-capacity ambulance, a rescue vehicle, a water rescue equipment vehicle, a respiratory equipment/radiation protection vehicle, an aerial ladder with basket 12/9, an infect rescue vehicle, various cars and trucks for the affiliated workshops, as well as the pressure chamber are housed. In addition, the colleagues with disinfector training are stationed here, to which are also alerted by certain key words, and are responsible for questions relating to hygiene and infectious diseases. The station is also assigned an emergency ambulance vehicle, which is located in Ottobrunn in the fire station of the volunteer fire department. The NEF in the Bogenhausen hospital is occupied alternately with the fire station 8.
In addition, an ambulance from the Aicher Union ambulance (occupied daily 8:00 am to 12:00 pm) is stationed at the Fire Station 5.
Fire Station 6 – Pasing.
Fire station in Pasing () began its service in 1979. It includes a workshop and warehouse building next to the station house. In this fire station, a department for preventive fire protection is housed, which carries out regular safety inspections and also gives advice in the case of identified deficiencies. In addition, the entire rescue medical education and training of the Munich Fire Department takes place in Pasing, which includes the training of rescue workers, paramedics, paramedic assistants including rescue assistants. In addition, also first-aid courses and training on automated external defibrillators are offered. In such cases, the fire station also works closely with the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in the further education of medical students, emergency physicians and other rescue service employees. Furthermore, one of the three respiratory protection workshops is located in Pasing, as well as the special equipment warehouse (warehouse for emergency aid). The latter mainly contains cots, sandbags, pumps, food containers and other material that can be acquired in a very short time.
In addition to the "classic" fire fighting vehicles found at the fire station, Pasing also houses various transport trucks, such as a roll off and multi bucket trucks, forklifts, wheel loaders and a fire department crane KW50. Furthermore, a heavy rescue vehicle, a device car for respirator/radiation protection, a large capacity ambulance, a water rescue trolley for the diver unit, as well as a tank fire truck 20/40-SL and a trolley "Großlüfter" (industrial fan) are stationed there.
The fleet is additional supported by a small alarm vehicle and the emergency ambulance vehicle of the station, which stand at the Pasing hospital. Fire Station 6 also has an intensive incubator for relocating newborns using RTW. Furthermore, training takes place at the fire station 6 for fire fighter divers and diving instructors.
Fire Station 7 – Milbertshofen.
Fire station 7 was procured in December 1960 as a group station and expanded in 1964 to an engine station. At that time, a workshop was also set up, in which the central carpentry is housed. This manufactures furniture and fittings for the professional fire department and is staffed by both officials of the station, as well as other employees.
Housed in the fire station Milbertshofen is a Munich fire and rescue engine, a hoses tanker 2000, and a small alarm vehicle. In addition, an emergency ambulance vehicle (NEF Neuherberg) is occupied at the "Helmholtzzentrum" site. An ambulance (NAW Nymphenburg) located at the "Klinikum Dritter Orden" is staffed together with personnel of fire station 3. Fire Station 7 also houses a 24-hour ambulance (RTW) ambulance station of the "Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund Deutschland".
Fire Station 8 – Föhring.
Fire station 8 occupies a special position among the Munich fire stations. It was built in 1995 on a city-owned property outside the city limits, so as to be able to protect the neighboring municipalities and especially a neighboring combined heat and power plant. The Fire station 8 is designed as a half force platoon station, which also has a practice tower and a sports field. In addition, the height rescue group is stationed there.
Fire station 8 houses a half force platoon (with nominal staffing 1/1/10/12) consisting of an ELW, an HLF and a DLK 23/12, as well as a tank fire engine 24/48 and the height rescue equipment vehicle are housed. The emergency ambulance (NEF) of the station 8 stands at the Bogenhausen hospital. An ambulance from MKT is also stationed at the FW 8 around the clock.
Fire Station 9 – Neuperlach.
Fire station 9 in Neuperlach has since 1975, taken over the fire protection in the southeast of Munich located district of Neuperlach. It houses an independent repair shop, which maintains and repairs the vehicles of the professional and volunteer fire departments. In addition, there is also a clothing workshop in Neuperlach, in which the personal protective equipment of the emergency personnel is stored, mended, washed and issued. A department of preventive fire protection is also represented in Neuperlach.
At present, the fire station 9 has a reduced half-force consisting of a rescue service group vehicle 20/16, an aerial ladder with basket 23-12, and a tank fire engine 20/40 SL. Furthermore, a small alarm vehicle and an ambulance are there. As special vehicles are also a fire-fighting crane 50 t, a large fan device vehicle, an all-terrain turntable ladder and a Hubrettungsbühne 53 housed in Neuperlach. The emergency ambulance has been at the fire station 9 since the beginning of 2010.
Fire Station 10 – Riem.
Since March 1998, fire station 10 is located on the site of the former Munich-Riem Airport. This was required by the new fair and the adjacent "Messestadt Riem". In particular, it also has an exercise yard and a riser tower. There is also a workshop for chainsaws and fire extinguishers, which, among other things, carries out the mandatory bi-annual inspections.
Fire station 10 currently houses a half force platoon (ELW, HLF, DLK) and a special fire engine, an ambulance and an emergency response vehicle (since July 2010) are stationed there. During the operation of the trade fair, the station is reinforced by a command vehicle and another rescue fire engine.
Volunteer fire department.
The voluntary fire department takes on a support function in Munich for the professional fire department. It helps out in the areas of fire protection, technical assistance and especially in the extended civil protection. In principle, it is called in for all operations involving personal injury. It is divided into 21 operational units, with 20 located in the outskirts of North, East, South and West, and one in the city center. As special units, it operates the ICT group, the flight marshal squadron, the ABC force and the catering squad of the Munich fire department.
The volunteer fire department is affiliated to the fire department. The head of the professional fire department or the fire department director (fire chief) works alongside the city fire council (commander), which in turn is supported by the city fire inspector and the four area leaders (city fireman). Their command (city fire inspection) is located in the fire station 4 (Schwabing). The Munich volunteer fire department was founded in 1866 as a result of a severe fire with fatalities. It was able to fall back on a fire station, which was built in 1794 and used by committed craftsmen and urban workers for fire protection tasks. In December 1870, additional volunteer fire brigades were integrated into today's disengagement area of the department city center. In the 1890s, other towns were added to the city of Munich, whose fire brigades were incorporated into the Munich volunteer fire department.
City Center (Downtown) Department.
The department city center was re-established in 1969 as the fire group city center, although fire service units already existed in the city center (see History above). It was included in the alerting plan of the professional fire department in the middle of 1971 and could be reached by phone, to set off with their two vehicles. The following years, the already grown group of over 50 men, was additionally equipped with radio detectives and received another emergency vehicle. Also, at the Olympic Games, the station participated in the constant watch.
With the incorporation of the air defense service in 1973 for the extended civil protection, the department city center received a new home, the Center for Civil Protection. However, the department was provisionally housed for several years in the former buildings of the police driving school on Dachauer Straße.
In 1984, the department, which grew to over 80 members, took over the (first) hazmat unit of the city of Munich.
The department is directly under the command of the volunteer fire department, its field of operations mainly covers the area within the middle ring. Since in this area all fire stations are located except stations 6 and 8 to 10, the City Center Division is only alarmed on special occasions or when a second platoon (2nd departure) is needed.
Currently, the department city center has four Munich fire and rescue engines, a Respiratory and Radiation Protection (air unit) vehicle, an NBC reconnaissance vehicle, a decontamination unit, a two-load interchangeable vehicle (WLF) with two containers (decontamination of civilians, water transport system). As trailers, there are stationed a trailer with industrial water vacuum cleaners, a light unit trailer and decontamination trailer. A multi-purpose vehicle (MZF) completes the vehicle fleet.
On Saturday, 21 May 2016, the department city center moved into its new fire station on Heßstraße 120. The VFD station is located in the rear building of fire station 4 (Schwabing) and is the first to be stationed together with the professional fire department in Munich.
Area north.
Department Feldmoching.
The Feldmoching department currently has a 20/16 rescue fire engine, an LF 16/12 and an LF 20 KatS.
Department Harthof.
Fire fighting group vehicle 16/12 (Munich model, manufacture year 2003)
The exact date of the founding of the former volunteer fire department Harthof can not be identified, but is dated to the year 1922. Only after the Second World War, which destroyed the structure of the Munich fire department, and led to a new start-up as a fire department Harthof of the Munich fire department in January 1948. This was planned to support the fire fighting in Feldmoching, which also received there fire station in 1950. A year later, the Munich Fire Department granted a request for independence of the fire fighting group. In the following years, the fire fighting group Harthof was further trained and expanded until 1979, when it was then recognized as a department and attained its present fire station. Today, the Harthof department is active with an Assistance Fire department vehicle 20/16, a 16/12 fire engine and an MZF, to which they can attach an e-sucker trailer if required.
Department Freimann.
The department Freimann, with over 35 active men and woman, was founded in May 1870 as an independent fire department and later incorporated into the Munich volunteer fire department. Today, the comrades partake in about 200 missions a year, making the department one of the most frequently alerted at the Munich volunteer fire department. Their fields of application include, among others, a large industrial area, the Allianz Arena, a large motorway section and the subway. Since 1995, with the appropriate indication, the department has been alarmed at the same time as the professional fire department. The fleet currently consists of a rescue service group vehicle 20/16, a fire engine 16/12, a tank fire engine 16/25 and a traffic safety trailer.
Department Oberföhring.
The volunteer fire department Oberföhring was founded in January 1870 and combined in 1907 with the neighboring forces from Daglfing, Unterföhring and Ismaning. When Oberföhring was incorporated into the city of Munich in 1913, the Oberföhring Fire Department was included as a 10th Division in the Munich Fire Department. Their first motorized fire engine, making them equally compatible with the other fire service units in Munich, reached the department Oberföhring only in 1932. At the time of National Socialism, the members of the volunteer fire department were integrated into the fire protection police or the "Wehrmacht", which meant the temporary end of this department. The reconstruction of this fire service department took place immediately after the end of the Second World War, even during the occupation.
After the takeover of the civil protection in Munich there was a restructuring of the fire department, so that the department Oberföhring since then, together with the departments Riem and Trudering, formed the fire department readiness in the area Ost1. In 1979, the department Oberföhring received a new fire station, in which the vehicle hall could accommodate three fire engines.
Following a change in the organization of the Munich volunteer fire department, the Oberföhring department has been assigned to the North division since 2004.
The Oberföhring department owns two fire stations. One of them in Oberföhring, in which a rescue fire vehicle 20/16 (OF 49-1), a fire engine 16/12 (OF 40-1) and a multi-purpose vehicle (OF 11-1) are housed. The other fire station is located in Englschalking in which another aid fire engine 20/16 (OF 49-2) and an LF 20 KatS (OF 41-1) is stationed.
Area east.
Department Riem.
The royal district office Munich country gave, in 1874, all municipalities the order to set up volunteer fire departments. As a result, the local mayor of Dornach-Riem convened a foundation meeting on 22 November at the "Gasthof Alter Wirt in Riem". All citizens and peasants of the 398-resident community were called upon to found a volunteer fire department. Spontaneously, 46 men agreed to join. In 1937, the district Riem of the community Dornach Riem was incorporated into the city of Munich. Munich received a population increase of approx. 1000 inhabitants and an area increase of 657.29 hectares. After about 62 years of community and good neighborliness, the paths of the volunteer fire department Dornach-Riem now parted ways. The existing volunteer fire department in the district Riem was assigned as "Halblöschzug 19" (a small size fire engine) of the Munich volunteer fire department and equipped with a "Sauer-Löschfahrzeug".
The Riem department currently owns an HLF 20/16, a fire engine LF 16/12 and a crew transport vehicle (MTF).
Department Trudering.
In Trudering in 1874, the volunteer fire department was founded and rebuilt in 1919 after the First World War. At this time, the districts Waldtrudering and Michaeliburg founded fire fighting groups that could support the fire department Trudering. As early as 1925, the fire department received an alarm siren, with which the firefighters could be alerted for missions. A large part of the comrades fell victim to the Second World War, the emergency vehicles were destroyed in the invasion of the Americans. Nevertheless, the fire department was re-established in 1945, so they could again provide for the safety in their area. Also, at the 1972 Summer Olympics, important tasks were given to the department Trudering. In 1982, a new fire station could be moved into, so that the previously housed separately vehicles were now available in one place.
Today, the Trudering department has a HLF 20/16, a fire engine 16/12, a 2000 hoses truck with crew space and, since 2015, a multi-purpose vehicle for transporting equipment and personnel. There are currently 30 firefighters, including 4 women, in the Trudering department.
Department Michaeliburg.
At the end of the 1980s, the department Michaeliburg was founded from the half-brigade of the 17th fire fighting group. With 45 active members, the department, together with Perlach, Riem, Trudering, Waldperlach and Waldtrudering belongs to the East area of the Munich fire departments. With a rescue fire truck, a fire engine 16/12 and a multi-purpose vehicle, the department is called on an average of 90 missions a year.
Department Perlach.
The Volunteer Fire department Perlach was founded in 1869 and was incorporated in 1930. In the course of this, the name volunteer fire department Perlach changed to volunteer fire department Munich, Department Perlach. Today, it has an Assistance Fire department vehicle 20/16, a fine engine 16/12, a 16/25 tanker and a traffic safety trailer.
Department Waldperlach.
The Department Waldperlach was founded on 3 April 1927, under the direction of Karl Freiherr von Stockhausen. After the Second World War, the fire department was reorganized by six of the founding members in 1949.
The department currently owns a fire engine 16/12, a tank fire engine 16/25, a multi-purpose vehicle, and the standard rescue fire engine 20/16 of the Munich Fire Department. In June 2016, an LF 20 KatS procured by the Federal Ministry of the Interior was put into active service.
In addition, the troops were assigned so-called external load containers for firefighting from the air (with helicopters e.g. the police helicopter squadron Bavaria) type SEMAT 900 (2 tanks with a capacity of 900 L each) and SEMAT 5000 (2 tanks with a capacity of 5000 L each), The department therefore supports the marshalling squadron of the Munich Fire Department. The equipment also includes a thermal imaging camera Evolution 5000 by MSA-Auer.
The, after 20-years of planning, newly built fire station is located in the "Gefilde 4" on the corner of Putzbrunner Straße, near the fire station 9 (Neuperlach). The move took place in October 2006 and was officially inaugurated at the 80th anniversary celebration in July 2007.
At present, 41 active firemen and women work in this department.
Department Waldtrudering.
The exact founding date of the firefighting group in Waldtrudering can unfortunately no longer be determined, since all documents were destroyed in the Second World War. However, in 1921 the history of the Trudering fire department mentions the Waldtrudering fire department, which was an important addition for the fire protection in the former municipality Trudering. In 1923, the official founding took place as an independent fire department. The Waldtrudering fire department then owned a hand pump, which had to be pulled by the crew. This was housed in a shed next to the former water tower. In 1930, an old hoses tank trailer with a motor-driven pump was purchased, which was pulled by a truck. Since the shed was too small to house this, it had to be enlarged. On 1 December 1931, the following was noted in the registration form when the Freiwillige Feuerwehr Waldtrudering was admitted to the Bavarian Fire Department Association:
Number of members:
Number of devices:
After incorporation of the town (to Munich) in April 1932, the fire service was renamed the Voluntary Fire Department Munich-Waldtrudering, "Halblöschzug 18" (a small size fire engine). After the war, there was no interest in the re-establishment of the fire department, until the proposal was made in 1957. At that time, the alarm was signaled by a siren, which was replaced in the early 1970s by the silent alarm system. Since 1992 the department is alarmed together with the professional fire department.
The department Waldtrudering is currently active with a rescue fire engine 20/16 (WT 40.1), a fire engine 16/12 (WT 40.8), and a MZF (WT 11.1). The department, which currently has 43 active members (including 6 female persons), is located in the area of Fire stations 9 and 10.
Area south.
Department Forstenried.
The Forstenrieder Fire Department consists of 29 active firemen and women (as of 12/2010). The area of operation extends from Boschetsrieder Straße in the north to the "Autobahnring" (belt highway) in the south and from Drygalski Allee in the east to the city limits in the west. The main tasks in the disengagement area are technical assistance, prevention and fire protection. In the case of major incidents, such as severe weather or major fires, however, the volunteer fire department Forstenried moves out throughout the city.
The fire station is located in the Forstenrieder Allee 177, the fleet consists of a rescue service group vehicle 20/16, a fire engine 16/12 and a tank fire engine 16/25 with traffic safety trailer. The rations truck, which serves to provide for the personnel during long-term operations, consisting of kitchen wagons and food trailers, is stationed at Gmunder Straße in the Civil Protection Center.
Department Grosshadern.
By the delivery contract of a fire-extinguishing sprayer of 29 November 1859, the existence of an organized fire department took place for the first time. The company "Kgl. Hoffeuerhaus Dominick Kirchmair" handed over an extinguishing sprayer with a double pumping station. It was used by 6 to 8 men and threw a steady stream of water up to 70 feet. The price of the sprayer was agreed with 500 guilders. The old sprayer was apparently built so solid or so little in use that only after 30 years, another extinguisher had to be commissioned. The new device was operated by at least 10 men and costed 1200 marks.
Under the "Most High Protectorate of His Royal Highness the Prince Regent Luitpold of Bavaria", the newly founded fire department in Großhadern at the Bavarian State Fire Brigade Association was registered on 8 September 1892.
Großhadern was incorporated into Munich in 1938 and so the fire department Großhadern became the department Großhadern of the Munich volunteer fire department. Making the department Großhadern, one of the youngest departments of the Munich volunteer fire department.
Today, the department Großhadern is active with a 20/16 rescue fire engine, a fire engine 16/25 and a multi-purpose vehicle (MZF). The active area of the volunteer fire department Großhadern includes the neighborhoods: Hadern, Blumenau and parts of Laim and Pasing. In the disembarkation area is the Großhadern hospital, the Augustinum, various laboratories of the LMU, 5 underground stations, as well as several schools.
The Großhadern department is located in the fire stations 2,3 and 6 and is deployed in major urban areas throughout the entire city of Munich.
Department Sendling.
In Sendling, as a result of a severe fire, a Volunteer fire department was founded in 1869. This was incorporated, with the incorporation of Sendlings in 1877, in the Munich fire department and was therefore the first outside Munich-based fire department of Munich. In 1889, it was decided to found another company near the "Schlachthof München" (slaughterhouse), which, like the company from Thalkirchen, was combined with the fire department in Sendling during the reorganization of the Munich volunteer fire department. The vehicles were housed in the fire station of the Sendlinger fire department, while the comrades in the slaughterhouse district and in Thalkirchen were placed at assembly stations, where they could be picked up by the professional fire department. During the Second World War, this fire station and all the equipment of the fire department were destroyed in a bombing raid.
In 1972, with the comrades of the fire department Großhadern created a fire group Waldfriedhofviertel, which would move out together with Großhadern. This fire group received a fire brigade vehicle in 1974 and was able to move out independently, and through time the group allocated more vehicles. Only in November 1980, this department was again named Sendling, after they had received a new fire station in the Zillertalstraße.
In Sendling are currently two rescue fire engines 20/16, two equipment vehicles, a team transport vehicle and three motorcycles stationed as Despatch riders.
Department Solln.
The volunteer fire department Solln, founded in 1873, was later integrated into the Munich fire department. Today, the department Solln is active with a rescue fire engine 20/16 and two fire engines 16/12.
Area west.
Department Allach.
The Department Allach exists since 1874 and was founded under the name Volunteer Fire Department Allach. In 1938, the incorporation of Allach into the city of Munich took place and from then, for more than sixty years, the independent volunteer fire department Allach was the Fire squad 27 of the Munich volunteer fire department.
On 1 June 1946, the roadhouse "Trinkl" was elected as the first fire squadron leader after the war. At this time, 15 active firefighters still belonged to the fire squad Allach. In 1974, the department Allach celebrated its 100th anniversary.
The Allach department currently has an HLF 20/16 rescue fire engine, two LF 16/12 firefighting vehicles and one MZF multi-purpose vehicle. The active team includes over 50 comrades. Making the Allach department one of the strongest personnel departments of the Munich volunteer fire department. The youth fire department of the department offers about 10 young people, aged 12 to 17 years, various leisure activities with a strong reference to fire-related topics. On average, the Allach department handles 150 missions a year, with technical assistance dealing with severe weather damage and fire fighting making up the bulk of the alarms.
Department Aubing.
The first reports of an "Löschmaschine" (fire apparatus) in Aubing date as far back as 1856. The official founding of the Volunteer fire department Aubing is 1 January 1882. In the course of the incorporation of Aubing to Munich, the fire department was taken over as the fire squad 29 of the Munich volunteer fire department.
Location of the department Aubing is the fire station at Ubostraße 11. Their active area includes Aubing, Aubing East, West Cross, Neuaubing and Freiham. In addition, there is the Moosschwaige, the Aubinger Lohe and "Bundesautobahn 99" with the "Aubinger Tunnel".
The fleet currently includes a multi-purpose vehicle (fire department), a rescue fire engine 20/16, a fire engine 20 for civil protection and a fire engine 16/12. In addition, the "Association of Friends of the Volunteer Fire Department Aubing" possesses horse-drawn fire engines. This is traditionally used at the Wiesn opening, in historical uniforms. From the association were also AED and thermal imaging cameras procured. This means that the HLF can be used as a First Responder vehicle, as is the case with almost all departments of the FF München (prerequisite: personnel with training as paramedics are on the vehicle).
The youth group of the department is integrated into the area West.
Department Moosach.
The Moosach department of the Munich volunteer fire department can now look back on more than 125 years of history. Since the middle of the 19th century, there was a mandatory municipal fire department in the former village of Moosach near Munich. This was replaced by the founding of the volunteer fire department in Moosach on 8 April 1879, Paul Berthold sen. was the first commander. As part of the incorporation of the village Moosach to Munich in 1913, the volunteer fire department Moosach was incorporated into the municipal fire department of the city of Munich as Division 8. Out of 14 active members drafted in the First World War, only four returned at the end of the war. On 25 December 1925, the department was the first Munich volunteer fire department to receive a motorized sprayer with a three-stage Magirus high-pressure centrifugal pump and a capacity of 800 to 1000 liters / minute.
On 21 April 1931, the Moosach department put the first automobile vehicle into active service at the Munich volunteer fire department. In 1933, the Moosach department was divided up and integrated into the general fire protection police. In the spring of 1945, the re-establishment of the Department 8 of the Munich volunteer fire department took place under commander Josef Heinrich. In 1954, the 75th anniversary of its founding was celebrated with a flag-consecration. In 1972, the so-called silent alerts were replaced by radio alarm receiver at the Moosach department, the first department of the Munich volunteer fire department to do so and it was introduced on the occasion of the Olympics. On 19 March 1979, the present fire station was handed over to the department Moosach. The old fire station was demolished in 1980. From 4 to 6 May 1979, the 100th anniversary of its founding was celebrated. In 1982, the Moosach department founded the first youth group of the Munich fire department, which celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2007. In 1993, Munich's first female fire fighter started her service in the Moosach department and successfully completed her basic training. On 2 May 2004, the Moosach department celebrated its 125th anniversary.
The Moosach department currently has a 20/16 rescue fire engine, a 16/12 fire engine and a multi-purpose vehicle.
Department Obermenzing.
The department Obermenzing currently has a fire engine 16/12 and a rescue fire engine 20/16 and a crew transport vehicle.
Department Langwied-Lochhausen.
The founding of the volunteer fire department Langwied-Lochhausen took place in 1878, during the tenure of Simon Heitmeier as mayor or Lochhausen . The first commander of the Langwied-Lochhausen fire department was Martin Naßl, who was elected at the constituent meeting on 5 March 1878. After the incorporation of Langwied-Lochhausen as the 40th municipality of the City of Munich on 1 April 1942, the formerly independent fire department of the village as fire brigade 30 was incorporated into the Munich volunteer fire department.
Today the department Langwied-Lochhausen consists of about 30 active fire service providers (including the youth fire brigade), which can rely on a high-quality fleet and equipment pool.
In addition to the mentioned vehicles, a multi-purpose trailer is available, which can be used for a wide variety of transports.
Department Ludwigsfeld.
The department Ludwigsfeld is located in the area west. Currently, Ludwigsfeld has a 16/12 fire engine and a 20/16 rescue fire engine, as well as a utility truck, which is also used as a driving school vehicle to train new drivers within the Volunteer fire department.
Youth fire department.
Munich Youth Fire Brigade was founded in 1982 in the Moosach department of the Munich Volunteer fire department and celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2007. The youth group is now an integral part of the Munich volunteer fire department. It is divided into five groups, in which around 250 boys and girls, between the ages of 12 and 18, actively deal with issues pertaining to firefighting. The members of the youth fire brigade are trained in fire-fighting technology and first aid, additionally there is an extensive leisure program.
Training.
The professional fire department contenders are trained in correspondence with the current national German regulations for example the transnational agreements, including those of the "Institut der Feuerwehr Nordrhein-Westfalen" (Institute of the Fire department North Rhine-Westphalia), depending on the qualification level (two to four). At the fire department school on FW2, training is mainly provided in the courses BI (basic course) and BIII (group leader course or equivalent courses after the administrative reform). The fire engine driver training courses (BIV) take place at the "Feuerwehrschule Geretsried" (SFSG).
The training of the volunteer fire department is carried out by the Training and Education Center (TAZ) in cooperation with the professional fire department. Except for special subjects, all courses up to and including the qualification level Group Leader (FIII) are offered in Munich. The basic training of FF München extends over a period of 3 years and lasts a total of 350 hours in a variety of different courses (see FwDV2 233 hours). It is completed with the qualification to Squadron Leader (FII) and the promotion to leading fireman / woman.
Emergency medical service.
The emergency medical service in the city and in the districts of Munich was founded in 1966 by the professional fire department and is still in operation today ("Rettungsdienstzweckverband München"). Since then, nine hospitals provide a physician specializing in internal medicine, surgery or anesthesia for service on the three ambulance and eight emergency doctor vehicles. The Munich emergency doctors are called out about 80 times a day.
Emergency doctor location.
The vehicles for the emergency medical service are stationed in the Surgical Clinic of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich city center (Florian Munich middle 70/1), in the hospital Großhadern (Florian Munich Großhadern 76/1), in the surgical hospital Munich south (Florian Munich Thalkirchen 76 / 1) in Thalkirchen, in Klinikum Schwabing (Florian München Schwabing 70/1), on Feuerwache 10 (Florian München Riem 76/1), in Klinikum München Pasing (Florian München Pasing 76/1), in the Klinikum Dritter Orden (Florian München Nymphenburg 70/1), the Helmholtz Zentrum München (Florian Neuherberg 76/1), the town hospital Bogenhausen (Florian München Bogenhausen 76/1), the fire station 9 (Florian München Neuperlach 76/1) and the fire station of the volunteer fire department Ottobrunn (Florian Ottobrunn 76/1). In addition, an ambulance is stationed on the rescue helicopter Christoph 1 (location Klinikum Harlaching). The ITH Christoph München, which is mainly used for transfers, is also available 24 hours a day for emergencies at the Klinikum Großhadern, which is staffed by two pilots, an emergency doctor and an air rescue assistant with intensive nursing additional training.
NEF or NAW.
Most German cities have switched to a rendezvous system; meaning the emergency doctor is brought to the place of deployment with a car, the emergency medical vehicle (NEF).
Despite the results of a study commissioned by the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior (TRUST = Trend and Structure Analysis of the Rescue Service in Bavaria) and the corresponding recommendation of the Institute for Emergency Medicine of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, to change all Bavarian NAW into NEF, they continue to use the emergency ambulance (NAW) in addition to the emergency medical vehicle (NEF) in Munich.
Since it is assumed that the NAW is critical to the rendezvous system in the densely populated neighborhoods, a NAW is still stationed at the "Chirurgischen Klinik Innenstadt" (Surgical Clinic), the "Dritter Orden Hospital" and the Schwabing Hospital. However, if the emergency doctor has significantly longer travel times, an ambulance or a first-responder vehicle of a fire station (Munich HLF) or a relief organization such as the "Bayerisches Rotes Kreuz" (Bavarian Red Cross) or "Malteser Hilfsdienst" (Malteser emergency service), is sent ahead.
Special Emergency Physicians.
In addition to these normal emergency physicians, Munich also has a pediatric emergency doctor, who is additionally alerted by the Integrated Control Center in case of emergencies involving children under the age of 12. The doctor rotates weekly with one of the four children's hospitals in Munich. The vehicle "Florian München 76/10" has its base at the main fire station, but is stationed at the hospital on duty. In addition, there is also a neonatal emergency doctor from the ranks of the children's specialists of the cardiological intensive care unit of the German Heart Center. Which is particularly alarmed in problem births - i.e., sudden birth at home or problematic births in clinics that have no neonatal intensive care unit. The neonatal emergency doctor and an intensive care worker are then picked up by the ambulance Florian München 70/30, who has a mobile incubator on board. Therefore, a newborn child can be supplied with intensive care until it is brought to a suitable children's intensive care unit.
In addition, there is a toxicological emergency medical service in Munich, which can help in the case of poisoning emergencies on the spot with the two large rescue vehicles.
Involvement of the fire department in the rescue service.
In Munich, the professional fire department takes over the emergency medical service, while ambulances are occupied by aid organizations and private rescue services. In addition, the ELRD (organizational leader ambulance service) is alternately provided by the BF (fire service) and the aid organizations. These include, in addition to the "Bayerisches Rotes Kreuz" (Bavarian Red Cross), the "Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe", the "Malteser Hilfsdienst" (Malteser emergency service) and the "Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund" (workers good Samaritan association). The private emergency services, which have been involved in emergency rescue since 1998, are mainly represented by the two companies MKT and "Aicher Ambulanz-Union" - they provide 6 or 8 RTW, and which meanwhile also provide ELRD units. In addition, the company IMS occupies an ambulance. Some of the rescue vehicles of the relief organizations and private rescue services are also stationed at the fire stations of the professional fire department.
At the fire stations, ambulances of the professional fire department are also stationed, which disengage with the fire engine each time. In the normal rescue service, they are not actually involved, since they serve for self-protection or to assist the staff on the fire engine. The crew has, in contrast to the other ambulance crews, a medical and firefighting training. If no ambulance of the regular rescue service is available, they are alerted to peak coverage. The same applies to the ambulances of the works fire service BMW, Krauss-Maffei, MTU / MAN and TU Munich in Garching.
Specialties.
Height Rescue.
Since May 1996 the Munich professional fire department maintains a height rescue group at the fire station in Föhring, from which five personnel are constantly on duty. They are part of the normal fire service and attend to conventional firefighting operations. About 110 times a year, however, they must also be alerted, since conventional life-saving equipment such as turntables, fall protection or the like is no longer sufficient. They also working closely with several air rescue services, which also help with rescue helicopters if necessary.
A Germany-wide unique cooperation exists between the hospital Bogenhausen and the height rescuers, since about 50 emergency physicians of this hospital were trained in height rescue. This also makes it possible to provide patients in exposed locations with emergency medical care and only then to rescue them through technical measures.
Water rescue / ice rescue.
Due to civil service regulations, all professional firefighters in Germany have completed training as a lifeguard (at the minimum the German rescue swimming badge in bronze). In addition, located at the fire stations 5 and 6, are a group of divers who disengage with their water rescue equipment vehicle in addition to the appropriate guards. Also, at the fire station 6, the training for fire fighter divers and fire service diving instructor takes place.
In order to save time, two divers of the fire station 5 are picked up by a rescue helicopter and flown directly to the place of the incident. In order to be able to provide effective assistance even before the arrival of the divers group, all other fire stations and fire station houses are also equipped with water rescue equipment. Also, for ice rescue, the corresponding units move out regularly.
Pressure chamber.
In order to be able to treat diver accidents, there is also a stationary pressure chamber (center for hyperbaric medicine) at the fire station 5, which is also suitable for the treatment of smoke poisoning and other intoxications. The pressure chamber is one of the few in Germany, which is on 24 hours standby and the appropriate medical professionals, for example diving physician, is available immediately. As a result, and through the corresponding technical equipment, intensive care of the patient is possible in the pressure chamber.
Analytical Task Force (ATF).
Since 2010 in Munich, there is also a joint Analytical Task Force made up from the volunteer and professional fire departments.
Air Operations Unit.
The air operations unit has been in operation since 2008, and carries out forest firefighting from the air and transports equipment and personnel to hardly accessible areas in cooperation with helicopters of other organizations such as military, federal and state police. The Air Operations Unit also sets up and operates outdoor landing sites (weather forecasting, flight information / guidance). For forest fire fighting, the unit has two 900 L and two 5000 L containers (see Dept. Waldperlach), as well as various additional material (e.g. 7000 L folding containers, forest fire fighting equipment).
Integrated dispatch and control center.
Munich operates the Bavaria wide oldest integrated dispatch and control center, which coordinates approximately 1,400 daily operations of the fire department, rescue service, THW and civil protection in Munich (emergency services of the districts also) and dispatches 540 vehicles. For this purpose, the dispatchers can fall back on a firefighting and rescue service training, as well as several years of operational experience.
The Integrated Dispatch and Control Center includes management rooms to enable the Civil Protection Operations Staff to coordinate large-scale operations. It also serves nationwide as a counseling center in dealing with hazardous substances and provides further help, if necessary, such as TUIS, ATF. It is also responsible throughout Bavaria for the coordination of intensive care transport helicopters, as well as the distribution and availability of beds for severely burned casualties.
The control center receives an emergency call on average every 30 seconds. In order to cope with the number of calls, the Integrated Control Center has 24 ISDN channels for the European emergency call 112 and 16 ISDN channels for the number 19222. These can be queried from 21 places at the same time, whereby in large operations and storms eight additional telephone workstations can be switched on. As a backup, since October 2005, an "emergency ILST" was implemented and is housed in the FW 1. In order to enable the deaf to request help, it is also possible to send an emergency fax. The processing of the mission data is therefore done with computer assistance.
Over nine radio channels of the 4-meter band and 16 2-meter bands, as well as digital radio, not only units can be alerted but they can also communicate with them, a radio network in the subway and S-Bahn also exists, as well as in special buildings (e.g. high-rise buildings so-called building wireless) therefore a connection with the emergency services is also possible.
In 2017, the Integrated Control Center moved from its previous location, the FW3, to the newly built FW4 in Schwabing.
Disaster control.
The Munich disaster control is made up from the professional fire department, the volunteer fire department, the worker "Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund Deutschland" (Samariter federation), the "Bayerisches Rotes Kreuz" (Bavarian red cross), the "Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe", the "Malteser Hilfsdienst e.V." (Malteser relief service), the "DLRG" (German life rescue society), the "Technisches Hilfswerk" (Federal institute for technical assistance organization) and the air rescue services. Volunteer members from these organizations that are involved in disaster protection were exempted from military service.
Effective action by these units is particularly dependent on a well-organized governance structure. Therefore, damage areas are divided into operational sections, which are led and coordinated by the local operations manager. In the event of a mass-casualty incident, additional assistance from a senior emergency physician and the organizational director (so-called sanitary mission management SanEL) is provided. The Integrated Control Center is responsible for passing on information and instructions to the individual operational units.
The central vehicle hall for the Munich disaster control is the Zeppelinhalle in the district Sendling. Also located there are large-scale warehouses for aid organizations.
Civil Protection.
The civil protection targets particularly at civilian protection in the case of required defense. The organization works parallel to the disaster control. In addition, however, the Munich Fire Department is also particularly active in the area of provisioning. For this purpose, it maintains thirty protection facilities, which also include large protection rooms, basic shelters and bunkers. In addition, the fire department school in Munich regularly offers instruction seminars for companies and citizens.
A special area of activity for the civilian protection is the drinking water supply. This is guaranteed by a system of shallow and deep wells throughout the city, whose connections are camouflaged for safety reasons.
Municipal Fire Department Association Munich.
The Municipal Fire Department Association München e.V., founded on 20 September 1993, unites all Munich fire departments into an interest group. The board consists of the head of the professional fire department (1st chairman), the acting commander of the volunteer fire department (1st vice chairman) and another person to be elected (2nd vice chairman).
If necessary, the individual members of the Municipal Fire Department Association can support one another in missions and carry out joint exercises. The Municipal Fire Department Association organizes a symposium every year, during which experts talk about current topics related to fire protection and technical assistance.

Lady Jean Fforde

Lady Jean Graham Sibyl Violet Fforde (née Graham; 11 November 1920 – 13 October 2017) was a British aristocrat and Arran landowner, who worked as a codebreaker at Bletchley Park. She is known for auctioning off 1000 acres of Arran farmland to pay for central heating in her island cottage.
Early life.
She was the daughter of The 6th Duke of Montrose and his wife, Lady Mary Louise Douglas-Hamilton. She was born in Edinburgh and spent much of her childhood at Castle Buchanan on Loch Lomond. In the summer she would spend a lot of time with the royalty of Monaco, including Prince Rainier III of Monaco, husband of Grace Kelly and Princess Antoinette. She described the times they spent together as being great fun, and they spent their days playing and eating cookies.
Lady Jean Fforde enjoyed balls and parties, and she came out as a debutante in 1939 where she was presented to King George VI.
Career.
Her father, who was The 6th Duke of Montrose, spoke to the then Lord Louis Mountbatten (who later became The 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma), which led to her getting a job as a "temporary assistant" at the government code and cypher school called Bletchley Park. Whilst working here she joined more than 8000 women in their mission to break German codes to help end the war. Thanks to her and all the other workers, this resulted in ending the war two years early.
Fforde also authored a memoir called "Feet on the Ground: From Castle to Catastrophe". In this book she wrote about her personal experiences, travels and adventures. She also described her experience at Bletchley Park as a "rather dull chapter in an otherwise colourful life" and she goes on to say that "it was excessively boring. It was not as glamorous as subsequent books and films have made it appear". Fforde described Alan Turing, the mathematical genius who worked at Bletchley Park, as a “very nice man, who should have had public recognition. He was a lovely man, an accessible man. Sweet, handsome, shabby, nail-bitten, sometimes halting in speech and awkward in manner". Fforde worked under Alan Turing in Hut 8 of Bletchley Park. She described her time there as "dull" and that the men working there were less pleasant, and the food inedible.
Personal life.
In 1947, the then Lady Jean Graham married Colonel John Fforde, who she later divorced in 1957. They had a son together called Charles Fforde. They spent a lot of time travelling, and they lived in Palestine, Sierra Leone and Northern Rhodesia.

Bulletproof Heart (film)

Bulletproof Heart (also known as Killer) is a 1995 independent Canadian-American neo-noir film directed by Mark Malone. It stars Anthony LaPaglia and Mimi Rogers, alongside a supporting cast featuring Matt Craven, Peter Boyle, Monika Schnarre, Joseph Maher, and Mark Acheson.
The film first premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and Houston International Festival in 1994, and was later released to the United States and the United Kingdom in 1995.
The story concerns a professional assassin Anthony LaPaglia who is pressured into accepting a new assignment as a favour to his boss Peter Boyle. He later finds himself in a dismal situation with dire consequences for everyone involved.
Plot.
The events of the film take place over the course of one night. The storyline follows Mick (Anthony LaPaglia), a cold-blooded, disinterested, existential hitman who is assigned the task of killing a woman that has stiffed Mick's boss George (Peter Boyle) $650,000. At first Mick is reluctant in accepting the job, but is later assured by George that the job will be easy, as the woman has accepted her fate.
After accepting the job, Mick's friend Archie (Matt Craven) begs to accompany him. Mick hesitates because Archie previously made a mistake in the last job and nearly cost George and Mick their lives. After much discussion, Mick accepts Archie's company.
When Mick arrives at the woman's house, he finds Fiona (Mimi Rogers) is expecting him. She ushers her guests from the party she is hosting, and invites Mick inside. Fiona's cool demeanour both surprises and impresses Mick. She soon has Mick tied to her bed, where the two engage in sadistic intercourse. Mick finds the pain Fiona inflicts on him arousing, and her ability to pleasure him is incomparable to other women Mick has slept with. As the two are dressing, Fiona dismisses Mick's performance, and they head downstairs to where Archie is waiting for them.
The more time they spend together, the less Mick is willing to kill Fiona. Feeling conflicted, Mick calls George demanding the severity of Fiona's crime and questioning the need for the hit. Ending his phone call with George, he returns to the car determined to finish the job, but with no rush.
Fiona suggests the three grab Chinese food, and head to the cemetery for a picnic. There, Fiona experiences a psychotic episode, and falls into a schizophrenic state. Mick rushes Fiona to a psychiatrist (Joseph Maher), who informs Mick that Fiona has an incurable mental illness that will most certainly soon destroy her. Torn, Mick takes Fiona to the shipping docks to finish the job, but finds he cannot bring himself to carry through.
When George arrives, he and Mick begin to argue once more over the need to complete the job. As the two are arguing, Fiona convinces Archie to kill her. Mick is left devastated.

2018 Nepalese presidential election

The third presidential election of Nepal was held on 13 March 2018. As a new election law was developed (which is foreseen by the Constitution of Nepal) and as, due to the Nepalese election in 2017, an electoral college could be established, the election took place three years after the previous presidential elections despite the presidential term of office actually being set at 5 years. The President was elected by an electoral college composed of the members of federal parliament and provincial assemblies. The total number of voters was thus 880, however the 331 members of Federal Parliament have a vote weight of 79, while the 549 members of Provincial Assemblies have a vote weight of 48. In total 862 lawmakers participated in the election leading to a turnout of 97.95%.
Results.
Bhandari's election was supported by her own party, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and coalition partner Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) as well as Federal Socialist Forum, Nepal, Rastriya Janata Party Nepal, Rastriya Janamorcha and Rastriya Prajatantra Party.
Vice-presidential election.
The election for the Vice President of Nepal was scheduled to take place on 23 March 2018. However, as incumbent Nanda Bahadur Pun, was the only candidate for the office and no complaints were filed against him, he was declared Vice President of Nepal by the Election Commission on 18 March 2018.

Alison Robins

Alison Robins (nee Gerrish) (9 March 1920 – 15 October 2017) was a British naval signals intelligence officer. She joined the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS, "Wrens") in 1939 as an officers' steward and later joined the "Y-Service" in World War II.
Early life.
Robins (nee Gerrish) was born in Branksome, Dorset, on 9 March 1920. She was daughter of Edward Arthur Gerrish (28 April 1878 – 7 November 1960), a servant, who later married the daughter of the house, Alison Kellie-McCallum (29 September 1887 – 23 May 1975). She grew up attending eight different schools as her parents moved for her father to find work. Alison finished her school education in 1938 and qualified as a riding instructor, as a member of the Royal Horse Society.
Bletchley Park.
As one of the WRNS, Robins was one of the last surviving members of the 'Y-Service' at Bletchley Park, who listened-in to German communications. During the Second World War, Robins was said to have been bored as an officers' steward waiting at table in the Painted Hall of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, so she joined a class to learn Morse code in her off-duty time. She quickly reached the speed needed to join the Signal School and in January 1941 passed the course and was made a Chief Petty Officer. Her first posting was to the R.N. Wireless Station at Scarborough. By May 1942 she was transferred to Felixstowe - a very busy station with E-Boats working continuously up and down the coast trying to destroy British convoys carrying vital supplies. All the Morse came in code that was passed to "Station X" to be decoded - a place so secret that few knew where or what it was. It was only in the late 1990s Alison discovered it was called Bletchley Park. In 1943, she moved to Sheringham in Norfolk where she decided to learn German so she could listen to speech as well as Morse from the U-boats. Various German speaking Wrens helped her learn by singing simple songs and she also bought a Hugo 'Teach Yourself German in 3 Months' book. Every day, German High Command gave out a report on the progress of the war and it was always at dictation speed so she learned to write it down accurately. She soon became proficient and was one of the few Wrens who could listen in both Morse and German. In 1943, she was transferred under the Commander-in-Chief, Dover - another very busy station with all the traffic passing through the English Channel and the build-up to the Allied invasion of Europe. She met her husband-to-be Maurice Robins while he was stationed near Dover with his regiment the 8th Middlesex. He went to France on D-Day+8 and fought through France, Belgium, Holland and Germany. As he had a degree in German, at the end of hostilities, he was seconded into Military Intelligence and used as an interpreter for the interrogation of German prisoners of war to decide who could safely be sent home and who should go on trial at Nuremberg.
In 2010, Alison Robins received the Bletchley Park badge from the Prime Minister, David Cameron, with the citation 'The Government wishes to express to you its deepest gratitude for the vital service you performed in World War II'.
Personal life.
Alison and her husband John Maurice Usher Robins (5 January 1918 – 21 October 1987), had four children together: Beatrice Anne, Elizabeth Jill, Rosemary Gay, and Marguerite Suzanne (5 July 1953 – 10 July 1953) who died five days after childbirth. By her death, she had 7 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren.

Myrick-Palmer House

The Myrick-Palmer House is a single-family house located at 223 W. Huron Street in Pontiac, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.
History.
Frederick C. Myrick moved to Pontiac some time after 1851, and the house was likely built for him in the 1850s. Myrick died in 1860, and his widow sold the house to Charles Palmer in 1862. Palmer was born in 1814 in New York state, graduated from Union College in 1837, and served as principal for various schools in the east. He moved to Michigan in 1847, working in Romeo and Flint as well as serving as a Regent of the University of Michigan. Palmer was also involved in mining, and promoted many interests in the Upper Peninsula before and after he moved to Pontiac. Palmer retired in 1875, and lived in this house until his death in 1887.
Description.
The Palmer House is a timber-framed, Italian Villa style two-story house on a fieldstone foundation. It is roughly cubical, with an L-shaped rear service wing. The walls are clad with flush siding, a fairly unusual feature in Michigan architecture. The house has a hip roof supported with paired brackets. Small decorative balconies are around many of the windows. A large flat-roofed cupola in the center of the roof was destroyed in a 1930 fire, and later rebuilt.
On the interior, a center entrance hall runs through the building, opening onto a parlor and two smaller rooms. Three bedrooms are on the second floor.

Hiranao Honda

 is a Japanese politician of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and a member of the House of Representatives in the Diet (national legislature). A native of Sapporo, Honda represents Hokkaido through the Hokkaido PR block.
Honda first ran for office in the 2003 election as the DPJ candidate for the Saitama 12th district, losing against the incumbent Toshio Masuda. He obtained a seat in the House in 2004 after a fellow DPJ member from the same proportional representation block resigned his PR block seat to run in the Saitama 8th district by-election. Honda remained a member until 2005, when he was defeated by Toshio Kojima in the Saitama-12th race. He would have a rematch with Kojima in the 2009 general election, when the DPJ won power from the LDP. He won by a 40,000-vote majority. During the DPJ's time in power, Honda served as a Special Adviser to Prime Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry under Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda.
The LDP landslide in the 2012 election swept Honda from his seat. He recontested the district in the 2014 election, again defeated by Atsushi Nonaka. After being replaced by Toshikazu Morita as the DP candidate for Saitama-12th for the 2017 election, Honda moved to the Hokkaido 4th district which encompasses parts of his hometown Sapporo. He contested the district for the first time in 2017 as a candidate for the post-split CDP. While losing against the incumbent Hiroyuki Nakamura, Honda obtained enough votes to be elected through the CDP's PR block list.
Honda is married to fellow representative Chinami Nishimura. The couple's main witness at their marriage was former Prime Minister Naoto Kan. They are one of the three married couples currently sitting in the Diet, besides Taku Yamamoto-Sanae Takaichi and Taku Ōtsuka-Tamayo Marukawa.
In late July, 2021, it was reported that during a closed Consitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP) meeting convened to discuss raising the age of consent from 13 to 16, Hiranao Honda said that, as a man in his 50s, he thought that it is “strange” that he might be arrested if he had sex with a 14-year-old girl who consented to the act. In reaction to the public outrage and the CDP's planned further punishment due to said outrage, he quit the party and his seat.

Giovanni de' Rossi

Giovanni de' Rossi (21 November 1431 - 1502) was an Italian condottiero and the fifth count of San Secondo. He was nicknamed 'il diseredato' (the disinherited).
Biography.
The eldest son of Pier Maria II de' Rossi and Antonia Torelli, he was born in San Secondo and was so different to his father (especially in politics) that he ended up disinheriting him in his 1464 will in favour of his legitimate sons Guido and Bernardo and his illegitimate son Ottaviano (Arluno). Giovanni was thus exiled with nothing and entered the service of the king of France, though he continued to claim the inheritance which had been denied him. When Pier Maria II died on 1 September 1482 in the midst of the Rossi War against Sforza troops under Ludovico il Moro and Pier Maria II's own son Guido, the succession became even more tangled. He attempted a last-ditch defence of the castle at San Secondo in 1483 before fleeing to Venice, where he died in exile in 1490. 
Giovanni refused to back either side during the war, as did his brother Bertrando. However, thanks to good relations with Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, Trivulzio returned the fiefdom of San Secondo to Giovanni, by then an old man Between 1497 and 1499 Giovanni and Gian Giacomo served under Louis XII of France and after Ludovico il Moro's fall the French king officially reinstated Giovanni in all his fiefdoms in 1499. He died at San Secondo in 1502 and was succeeded as count by his son Troilo I. The conflict provoked by Pier Maria II's will was finally fully resolved by the Battle of San Secondo in 1522.
Marriage and issue.
Giovanni married Angela Scotti Douglas, daughter of Francesco Scotti Douglas, count of Carpaneto and Vigoleno. They had four children:

LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-2T 41241

41241 is an LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-2T that was built at Crewe Works in September 1949. It is one of four members of the class left in preservation but one of only two that is located on the mainland (the other locomotive being 41312); the other pair being located on the Isle of Wight.
Working Life.
Number 41241 was built by British Railways at Crewe Works in September 1949. From new it was allocated to Bath Green Park on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway and saw use on local passenger services over the S&amp;D including the occasional banking job. Alongside spending the first 9 years allocated to the S&amp;D it was reallocated to Bristol Barrow Road in July 1958, this however was not to last for long and it returned to its former home at Bath Green Park in October 1958 (by then under the control of the Western Region of British Railways).
Other shed allocations it was based at included: Wellington, Leamington Spa, Bangor, Croes Newydd, Llandudno Junction and Skipton. Following its allocation to Wellington, it was transferred back to the London Midland Region and was allocated to Leamington from February 1964. The final shed allocation was to Skipton, and it was to remain there for the rest of its working days on BR until 10 December 1966 when it was withdrawn from service.
Purchase from BR.
Number 41241 was purchased directly from BR by the nearby Keighley and Worth Valley Railway for preservation, arriving on the KWVR in March 1967 under its own power. Due to BR requiring that preserved steam locomotives did not wear the BR livery with their then current crest, it was repainted into lined maroon livery with the letters K&amp;WVR written on her sidetanks. It wore this livery for the railway's reopening in June 1968 and in 1975 it made its only preservation mainline appearance at the Rocket 150 cavalcade in Shildon; it arrived and returned from the event under its own power with a set of the Worth Valley's coaches.
It was later repainted into authentic BR black livery and this livery it has worn for most of its preservation career; it has worn both the early and late versions of the BR black livery in preservation and is expected to keep this as its main livery. It last operated on a heritage railway in January 2013 and has since then being undergoing an overhaul at Haworth. With 2018 being the 50th anniversary since the K&amp;WVR was opened in 1968 as well as the 50th anniversary since 1T57 in August 1968, the K&amp;WVR had decided that it would return to its original maroon livery with the K&amp;WVR lettering on her sidetanks. After an extensive overhaul, it was able to run in the K&amp;WVR 50th Anniversary gala in July 2018, and now operates regularly on the K&amp;WVR.

At the time the Mid Hants Railway were running their own charter train company known as "Daylight Railtours" and it was decided for it to be certified for mainline use to work a couple of smaller trains around the south of England. Due to its limited water capacity of 1,350 gallons it was not able to stray too far from its home at the Mid Hants and it was not able to work the normal 10-11 coach trains that Daylight Railtours usually ran. It recently returned to service from an overhaul but has not been certified for mainline use.

Victoria Coffey

Victoria Coffey (September 16, 1911 – June 15, 1999) graduated from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and became a paediatrician, and later one of the first people to research sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and one of the first females to undertake significant research into congenital abnormalities. She also became the first female president of the Irish Paediatric Association, the paediatric section of the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland, the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland (RCSI) Post-graduate Association, and the Irish American Pediatric Association. Coffey was also the first female recipient of the RCSI Distinguished Graduate medal.
Early life and family.
Victoria Philomela Dorothy Coffey was born on 16 September 1911 at 108 Brunswick Street (now Pearse Street) in Dublin, Ireland. She was the daughter of John Coffey, a weigh-master, cattle exporter and bookmaker and Ellie Coffey, who ran The Royal Arms in Kilcullen. Her paternal grandfather William Coffey had been Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1909 to 1910. During her childhood, Victoria—known to friends as "Viki"— won numerous medals for her musical performances. She played the piano and cello, and trained as a singer under instruction from Vincent O'Brien.
Coffey had 10 siblings. Her younger sister Pauline also became a doctor and won prestigious awards in the Royal College of Surgeons. Five of Coffey's siblings died as children—four in infancy. According to Coffey's grand-nephew Robert Coffey, "that was one of the main reasons she was so motivated to learn about the health of newborns and young children". He described her as "a no nonsense person but with quite a wicked sense of humour". She helped raise for the Dominican mission (now the Dublin Christian Mission), with which her brother Cecil was associated. She survived poliomyelitis in 1955.
Education and career.
Coffey was known for her diligence and hard work. At the age of 25, she qualified for the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), where she graduated with a licentiate degree and a degree in midwifery from the conjoint board of the RCSI. Seven years later, in 1943, she earned a DPH diploma in Children's Health at the RCSI.
She developed strong qualities of leadership, responsibility, and pugnacious personality by working with men such as Tom Lane, Henry Stokes and Oliver St. John Gogarty at Meath Hospital, the cradle of the Dublin School of Medicine, where she was a student and house officer. In the same year, she served as a clinical clerk at Coombe Hospital for Women. Shortly afterwards, she was appointed as a medical officer in St Kevin's Hospital due to her knowledge of obstetrics. At St. Kevin's Hospital, Coffey became interested in the neglected field of congenital birth defects and began a publishing career. She was motivated to learn about the health of babies and young children, and focused on paediatrics.
Coffey's first paper, which she wrote in 1953, is about syphilis in children. Her research mainly focused on children born with congenital and metabolic diseases, and was completed with the help of the Medical Research Council, Trinity College Dublin and Professor Jessop of Meath Hospital. She then began to research sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and was one of the first women to study it. Her numerous publications covered most aspects of congenital disorders. In 1954, Coffey gave a paper on this topic at the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.
Coffey published her findings in the "Irish Journal of Medical Science" between 1955 and 1959. In recognition of her work in paediatrics, she was appointed lecturer in teratology at Trinity College Dublin in 1961, earning a Ph.D. from the University of Dublin in 1965 for a thesis on the incidence and aetiology of congenital defects in Ireland. She published internationally and maintained her research output for several years after her retirement. Coffey founded the Faculty of Paediatrics at the RCPI in 1981 and was the first female president of the Irish Paediatric Society.
Later life and legacy.
Coffey lived in Rathmines, a suburb of Dublin, with her parents before their deaths, and remained there until her own death. She died at 87 on 25 June 1999 in St. James's Hospital, where she had worked most of her life. She is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin; according to Lynn Brady, Coffey's grave is at the LF103 Garden Section of the cemetery.
On International Women's Day in 2018, Coffey was honoured for her outstanding contribution to medicine and was chosen to be part of "Women on Walls", an arts project hosted by RCSI in partnership with Accenture, with her portrait displayed in the RCSI's principal boardroom.

Große Kirche Aplerbeck

The Große Kirche Aplerbeck is a Protestant church in Aplerbeck, now part of Dortmund, Germany. It was built from 1867 to 1869 in Gothic Revival style, designed by Christian Heyden. A listed monument, it is used by the parish St. Georg, serving mostly as a concert church.
History.
In the 19th century, the population of Aplerbeck increased due to industrialisation. The medieval church Georgskirche was too small. The new church, which was left without a name for a long time, was built from 1867 in Gothic Revival style on a design by Christian Heyden, who built the same church in Gütersloh. A design for galleries, to increase the space for 1,200 people, was never realised.
The church was inaugurated on 15 December 1869, without giving it a name. Locally, it was called the Protestant church ("Evangelische Kirche"). Another name was Black Church ("Schwarze Kirche") because the paint of the ceiling had darkened. The church was located in the Kirchstraße (Church Street) until Aplerbeck became part of Dortmund in 1929, and the ambiguous street name was changed to Märtmannstraße.
On 12 April 1945, US troops waited to enter Aplerbeck. The sexton hoisted a white flag as a sign of capitulation, while another white flag was hoisted at the town hall, which made a peaceful entry possible.
From 1999, the church was mostly used for concerts, and was consistently called "Große Kirche".
Building.
The church is a hall church with three naves of five bays and a prominent choir. The walls are structured by buttresses and tracery windows. The interior is structured by slender columns with leaf capitals, which support a high rib vault.
Steeple.
The high steeple in the west is a landmark, reaching . It has a quadrangle floor, with an octagonal upper part and a helmet topped by a weathercock. Four sides of the upper part, those parallel with the lower part, carry high abat-sons, while the diagonal walls are decorated with lesenes. The pointed helmet with copper shingles is framed by balusters at the bottom.
Furnishing.
The company Schulze &amp; Söhne from Paulinzella, Thuringia, who built the organ, also installed the altar and the pulpit. The painting on the high altar, showing a Crucifixion scene, was created in 1885 by . While many furnishings designed by Heyden were changed over the years, the painting has been returned to the church.
Church music.
The organ was built by Schulze &amp; Söhne. It was inaugurated on 15 December 1869, and approved on 1 October 1870. It was improved in 1935 by Walcker, adding pipes, installing electrical tracture and changing the console. Further improvements by Walcker followed in 1939, such as changing stops.
In 1870 already, people complained about the long reverberation in the building of seven seconds. In 1967, Albert Eisenberg, an international acoustics specialist, recommended new benches with textile cushioning. From 1999, the church has been used mostly for concerts.
Historic monument.
In 1967, the parish requested listing of the building as a historic monument (Denkmal), because it needed major repair which the parish could not afford. It was declared an example of a neo-Gothic hall church of rare unity of style ("ein Beispiel einer neugotischen Hallenkirche von seltener Geschlossenheit" on 6 December 1967.
Siegfried Liesenberg wrote a guide book in 2001, "Der Zeigefinger Gottes. Zur Geschichte der Großen Kirche Aplerbeck in der Märtmannstraße.", which translates to "God's Index Finger", about the history of the Große Kirche in the Märtmannstraße.

Louise Hammond Willis Snead

Louise Hammond Willis Snead (pen name, Louis Hammond Willis; 1870 – 1958) was an American artist, writer, lecturer, and composer. Her art specialized in miniature painting, illustrations, and needlework. She lectured on Persian rugs, wrote articles of various topics under a masculine pseudonym, and even composed a march.
Early years and education.
Louise Hammond Willis was born in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1870. From her mother, Elizabeth Louise Hammond, she inherited a love of nature and a scientific mind. From her father, Major Edward Willis, she inherited ambition, an indomitable will and perseverance. The Willis home was the meeting place of men and women of talent and distinction.
She was graduated with first-honor medal and diploma from the Charleston Female Seminary. Her art studies were carried on in Charleston, under E. Whittock McDowell, and in New York City under James Carroll Beckwith and Harry Siddons Mowbray. She studied drawing, painting and modeling under William Merritt Chase, Frank DuMond, Irving Ramsey Wiles, and others at Art Students League of New York, New York School of Art and in European galleries, as well as being a pupil of Theodora Thayer and Alice Beckington. Snead also completed a post-graduate course in literature and languages.
Career.
While still a student, Snead had charge of the painting and drawing classes at Charleston Female Seminary. She was the assistant teacher in the Carolina Art School. Believing that everything helps everything else, she applied herself to the study of architecture, and in so doing, developed plans. While her specialty was portraiture, her illustrations and pen-and-ink drawings were meritorious, while she also excelled in the art of fine and artistic needle work, point-laces and art embroideries. 
Snead exhibited for years in the New York Watercolor Society and at the American Society of Miniature Painters. She designed houseboats and model modern suburban homes for ten years. She received Honorable mention at the South Carolina Inter-State and West Indian Exposition, 1902. Snead lectured on “The Magic Carpet," or the making of real Persian rugs. Other lectures were on topics of special interest to women's clubs, one being point laces. She illustrated a series of articles on the subject of point-lace making for "Chautauqua Magazine". Snead copied many antique embroideries from museums, in the line of art needlework. She was interested in handicrafts, weaving, hammered brass, illuminated leather, tapestry and in all lines of interior decoration.
Snead was familiar with a half-dozen languages. She wrote both prose and poetry for magazines, her writings appeared over the pen name "Louis Hammond Willis." Snead contributed largely to women's magazines for fifteen years, and illustrated her own articles. She also played on a number of musical instruments. Having studied the theory of music, her compositions demonstrated originality. Snead composed approximately 20 songs and a march that was orchestrated by Victor Herbert and played by Patrick Gilmore's Band.
Personal life.
Snead made her home at 1 Wilson Avenue, Murray Hill, Flushing, Long Island, New York. She was a member of Daughters of the American Revolution, and the Pennsylvania Society of Miniature Painters. By religion, she was Protestant. Her recreations included landscape gardening, building stone pillars and walls, and making concrete garden furniture.
She married Harry Vairln Snead of New York City, son of Col. Thomas L. Snead of Virginia. They had one daughter, Louise Vairin Snead.

Double Concerto (Henze)

The Double Concerto by German composer Hans Werner Henze is a double concerto for oboe and harp, better known by its original Italian title Doppio concerto. It was completed and first performed in Zurich in 1966, and published by Schott.
Composition.
Henze's Double Concerto was commissioned by Paul Sacher and his Collegium Musicum Zürich and is dedicated to him and his wife, Maya Sacher, like Henze's Sonata per archi. It was written for oboist Heinz Holliger and his wife, harpist Ursula Holliger. It was finished in 1966 and was premiered on 2 December 1966 by the Holligers as the soloists and Sacher conducting his Collegium Musicum Zürich. It was eventually published by Schott Music.
Structure.
The concerto is in one movement which has a total duration of approximately thirty minutes. It is divided in a ternary ABA1 structure, with an additional coda based in B, which recalls the structure of Bartók's third quartet. In recordings, the tracks are usually divided according to this structure:
Since this is a concertante piece, it features many technical challenges, such as double harmonics, flutter-tonguings, microtone glissandi and the so-called circular breathing, a technique which was fairly recent at the time. For Henze, it is important to have a decorative contrast in instrumentation such as the harp, since "the distinctive oboe timbre can exhaust the listener if overdone". The concerto is scored for the two soloists, oboe and harp, and a string section consisting of 18 soloists, eight violins, four violas, four cellos and two double basses.

Romania gens

The gens Romania was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. No members of this gens appear in history, but many are known from inscriptions.
Origin.
The nomen "Romanius" belongs to a large class of gentilicia formed from surnames ending in the suffix "-anus", typically derived from place-names. Here the name is derived from a cognomen, "Romanus", referring to a resident of Rome itself.
Praenomina.
The Romanii used a wide variety of common praenomina, including "Lucius", "Gaius", "Marcus", "Publius", "Quintus", "Titus", and "Gnaeus". Other names are found occasionally, including "Aulus", "Numerius", "Decimus", "Servius", and "Tiberius". The Oscan praenomen "Salvius" occurs in a filiation, suggesting that at least some of the Romanii were of Oscan descent.
Branches and cognomina.
In imperial times, the Romanii used a number of surnames, but all appear to have been personal cognomina, and the Romanii do not appear to have been divided into distinct families.
