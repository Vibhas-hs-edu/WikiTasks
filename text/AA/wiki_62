Special Operations Executive in popular culture

The Special Operations Executive (SOE) was a British organisation that conducted espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in World War II. It has appeared in popular culture in film, comics, books, and television. In 1981, the official historian of the SOE, Michael R. D. Foot, said that the staff of SOE consisted of about 10,000 men and 3,000 women. Speaking of the women agents in the field, he said, "A few highly accomplished and gallant ones were agents operating in France or Yugoslavia." Foot cautioned that "On these few there is a large popular literature, almost all of it worthless and much of it about the wrong people." The declassification of documents of the SOE beginning in the 1990s will permit more accurate portrayals of agents and their accomplishments.
Theatre.
The work of the SOE and three of its operatives was explored by playwright David Morley in A Cold Supper behind Harrods which was originally a 2012 BBC radio play with David Jason, Stephanie Cole and Anton Lesser but later transferred to the stage in 2021.

Chinese Americans in the Mississippi Delta

The Mississippi Delta Chinese are a small community of Chinese Americans that has lived in the Mississippi Delta region since the late 1800s. A related population of Chinese Americans lives across the Mississippi River in the Arkansas Delta and the nearby city of Memphis, Tennessee. 
History.
The earliest Chinese settlers in the Mississippi Delta were laborers recruited by cotton planters to supplement the recently emancipated African freedmen during Reconstruction. Like other early Chinese Americans, the first Chinese immigrants were peasants and merchants from the Sze Yap region of Guangdong province in Southern China. All of them were single and married men who worked in Mississippi and sent most of their income back to their families in China. As they were neither black nor white, the Chinese were often classified as "colored" in early government records. 
By the end of the 1870s, the Chinese had abandoned the plantations and began opening small family-owned grocery stores in the many small towns of the Delta. Chinese families began moving to the Delta in the early 1900s, and most modern Mississippi Delta Chinese are the descendants of Chinese who arrived in Mississippi during this time. Until the end of the 1900s, Chinese-owned groceries could be found in every Delta city and town, serving both white and black customers. Chinese children were originally segregated from the white public schools, and segregated Chinese schools were built for them in Greenville and Cleveland. However, these schools were closed and Chinese children were allowed to attend both white schools and white colleges after the Second World War.
The population of the Mississippi Delta Chinese exploded after war. Many young Chinese men from the Mississippi Delta served as soldiers during the Second World War, and many women from China married these soldiers and settled in the Delta as war brides after the war. By the 1970s there were as many as 3,000 Americans of Chinese descent living in the Delta, especially American-born Chinese children who were raised in the Delta. For decades the Mississippi Delta Chinese community was one of the largest Chinese American communities in the American South, but since then, many families have moved to larger cities in Texas, the West Coast, and the Northeast. Most of the historic Chinese groceries have already closed, and only a few families remain in the Delta.
Ethnic identity.
Arriving into a strictly segregated society with whites on top and blacks on the bottom, the Chinese carved out their own unique niche in a primarily biracial society. Neither black nor white, they were initially classified as "non-white" and later as simply "Chinese". While not seen as being on the same social status as whites neither were they seen on the same level as blacks despite often living in black neighborhoods and serving mostly black clients and customers. The Chinese were middlemen between blacks and whites, often providing a needed contact point in a segregated society. The Chinese initially attended separate Chinese schools separate from both blacks and whites although in later decades before segregation officially was outlawed, they often attended schools with white students. In many cases they sought to identify with white society as much as they could due to whites having the highest status in Jim Crow society. Many Chinese men, for the lack of Chinese women to marry, married Black women.

Eulalia Kadmina

Eulalia Pavlovna Kadmina (; 1853, Kaluga — 1881, Kharkov) was a Russian singer, contralto, mezzo-soprano, dramatic actress.
Biography.
Early years.
Eulalia Kadmina was born in Kaluga in the family of a Kaluga merchant Pavel Maksimovich Kadmin and a gypsy Anna Nikolaevna. In the XIX century, such unions were considered extremely unusual. Eulalia was the youngest of the three sisters. From early childhood, she began to show a violent, very proud and independent character.
Eulalia grew up as a closed, lonely child, who did not meet at all with anyone, even with her own sisters. She learned to read early and spent all her free time reading books. The father singled it out against the background of other children, and at the age of 12 arranged for Eulalia in a prestigious educational institution Moscow Elizabeth Institute.
The Institute was famous for its strict discipline and high level of education. In order to prevent the young pupils from distracting from training, all the windows of the establishment were thickly smeared with chalk, so there was no way to look out onto the street. Leaving the walls of the Elizabeth Institute, girls, as a rule, became governesses. Everyone noted that they were the wildest governess, since the presence of the man at the table led the girls into a terrible embarrassment. Girls were not adapted to life. Kadmina was already looking for a graduate of the workplace, as one meeting occurred, dramatically changed everything.
Young pupils often gave concerts for guests. Possessing a wonderful voice, Eulalia often took part in them. In 1870 Nikolai Rubinstein visited such an amateur performance. Struck by the singing of Eulalia, he persuaded her to devote herself to music and become a singer.
Nikolai Rubinshtein took an active part in the fate of the beginning singer. Despite the fact that after his father's death in the same year of 1870, Kadmina's family was left without money, he helped the girl not only become a student of the Moscow Conservatory in singing class, but also receive a scholarship.
Among the teachers of Kadmina were such honored artists as Alexandra Alexandrova-Kochetova, Ivan Samarin and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Later, charmed by her velvety rich mezzo-soprano, Tchaikovsky wrote specially for her music to the spring fairy tale of Alexander Ostrovsky "The Snow Maiden".
At the age of eighteen, her stage debut took place. Nikolay Rubinstein invited the budding Kadminа to the role of Orpheus in the Gluck's opera "Orpheus and Eurydice".
— Eulalia, when she wanted, could be more aristocratic than all princesses. And will find a frenzy on her it will dissolve worse than a street girl, — theatrical critic Alexander Amfiteatrov wrote about the brilliant student of the Conservatoire. Alas, she categorically did not appreciate her talent, nor the generous gift that fate gave her.
As a result, he secretly leaves, actually runs to the main country of opera in Italy.
Italy.
Cadmina sings in Naples, Turin, Florence and even in Milan, and everywhere she is invariably accompanied by a resounding success.
But here, too, she can not be saved from herself and experiences the same loneliness that burns her from within. At some point, Kadmina understands that Italy no matter how enthusiastically she was received here is a career impasse, a trap in which she was driven by life inexperience and ambition.
Twice Eulalia tries to commit suicide: she throws herself into the river, but the police drag her out unscathed, drink poison, but the strong body copes. Nervous, he gets sick, and then the young doctor Ernesto Falconi comes to the aid of the opera diva, who is able to cure not only her body but her soul, unfortunately, for a short while.
A young Italian makes her an offer, and she accepts it. Did the girl love him? Hardly. Most likely, she just saw in a good Italian salvation from her agonizing loneliness. But the Italian period inevitably comes to its logical conclusion. Kadmin is increasingly drawn to his homeland, but she does not want to go back to where she already had a deafening triumph. And then an invitation comes from an entertainer of the Kiev Opera House, Eulalia accepts him.
Kiev.
In Kiev, her success is predictably deafening: at the premiere of the opera Aida at the Kiev Opera House, the curtain is raised 15 (!) Times encore. But after the Mariinsky Theatre and Bolshoi, this is already a clear career decline, and its consequences were not slow to manifest.
The atmosphere of the theatrical Kiev was thoroughly patchy: stuffy, shallow and mean. The theatrical public is divided into the fans of one or another opera diva, and she encounters the arrival of a new rival. Eulalia is beginning to harass in every possible way: at concerts she is booed, ordering corrupt verses from corrupt journalists.
All this painfully self-respecting Kadmina experienced very hard. And then the discord began in the family life. The Italian husband was uncomfortable in someone else's Kiev for him, besides, he was very jealous of his wife. In the end, the couple part with a scandal, and Ernesto returns to his homeland.
In Italy, Kadmina not only did not regret her voice, but also in every possible way tested it for strength. She sings whole parts not only in her natural mezzo-soprano, but also in a higher soprano. Dangerous experiments did not pass without a trace, and the singer with horror realizes that she begins to lose her voice. It would seem that the prima donna's career is over. But fate favors her and gives her a second chance.
Kharkov Theater offers Kadmina try himself on the dramatic stage. She accepts the invitation.
Kharkov.
In 1881, Kadmina passionately falls in love with an officer. A romance is breaking out. Her chosen one, who came from an impoverished noble family, soon decides to marry and looks for an advantageous party. Trying to escape from mental anguish, Kadminа plunges headlong into work.
November 4, 1881 in the Kharkov Theater put a play by Alexander Ostrovsky "Vasilisa Melentyeva". The actress, as always, plays passionately, passionately. The atmosphere in the hall is heated to the limit. And suddenly among the spectators Kadmina sees his former lover with the bride.
Cadmina is furious, the revenge plan is immediately born in her head. During the interval Kadmina found matches in the latrine, broke off the phosphorus heads, filled them with tea and drank this mixture.
Memory.
The actress's suicide on stage caused a whole wave of responses in Russian literature. Under the influence of the tragic fate of Eulalia Kadmina, Ivan Turgenev's novel "After Death (Klara Milich)", Alexander Kuprin's "The Last Debut", Nikolai Leskov's "Theatrical Character", Aleksey Suvorin's plays "Tatiana Repina" and its continuation under the same Anton Chekhov's name, Solovtsov-Fedorov's play "Eulalia Radmina".
She was buried in the 1st city cemetery in Kharkov. In 1972, due to liquidation of Kharkov's 1st city cemetery, because the cemetery became totally neglected and very squalid, her remains were reburied in the 13th city cemetery in Kharkov which remains to this day. On the grave there is a modest half ruined monument with a short inscription: Eulalia Pavlovna Kadmina is a famous actress.

UK Withdrawal from the European Union (Legal Continuity) (Scotland) Bill 2018

The UK Withdrawal from the European Union (Legal Continuity) (Scotland) Bill 2018, colloquially known as Continuity Bill within the Scottish Parliament or the EU Continuity Bill within Scotland, provided for all matters devolved under the Scotland Act 1998 and subsequent legislation that are currently under the control of the European Union, to be repatriated to the Scottish Parliament upon 'exit day'. It was referred to as the Scottish EU Continuity Bill outwith Scotland, was a passed legislative bill by the Scottish Parliament with a stated view to prepare devolved elements of Scots law in view of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. 
This bill was introduced to the Scottish Parliament amid failing negotiations between the Scottish Government and the Government of the United Kingdom on where key powers, which would ordinarily be devolved, should lie on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union.
The bill was referred to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom under section33 of the Scotland Act 1998 by the Attorney General for England and Wales (on behalf of the UK Government) and the Advocate General for Scotland. The case summary according to the court in "UK Withdrawal from the European Union (Legal Continuity) (Scotland) Bill 2018 – A Reference by the Attorney General and the Advocate General for Scotland" ([2018] UKSC 64) stated:
On 13December2018, the Supreme Court ruled that only section17 of the bill would have been outwith the legal competence of the Scottish Parliament under the Scotland Act 1998 at the time of its passage. However, due to the passage and enactment of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 by the UK Parliament while the Scottish Bill was under review, many more sections of the bill are not within its legal competence and that the bill as far as those sections are concerned is therefore 'not law'. The governments of Scotland and of the United Kingdom differed sharply on the outcome. The (UK) Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, said the court had "provided much-needed legal clarity" that the bill "goes beyond the powers of the Scottish Parliament". But Scotland's Brexit Secretary Michael Russell argued that the UK government had "changed the rules of the game midway through the match" in an "act of constitutional vandalism".

After Lita was inducted by Trish Stratus she shared a number of stories about how she started in professional wrestling from Mexico until eventually winding up in the WWE. One story Lita told was how she first met Arn Anderson and her desire to meet Rey Mysterio. Lita expressed that Anderson helped her meet Mysterio in exchange for a Miller Lite. Lita stated she never fulfilled that promise and wanted to now, at which point Stratus return with three Miller Lites, which Lita, Anderson and Mysterio shared.
Jake "The Snake" Roberts was inducted by Diamond Dallas Page. During both of their speeches, the two spoke about Roberts' issues with alcoholism and how he spent many months living with Page attempted to rehab. Roberts credited DDP Yoga with saving his life. Roberts concluded by thanking his kids for giving him a second chance after all he had put their family through over the years.
Mr. T was inducted by Gene Okerlund into the Hall of Fame.
Paul Bearer was posthumously inducted by Kane. During the induction, Kane shared several stories about traveling with Bearer and about their relationship. Due to Bearer's passing in March 2013 his induction was accepted in his honor by his sons Daniel and Michael Moody. Also The Undertaker made his appearance and pays respect to his manager, Paul Bearer.
Razor Ramon (Scott Hall) was inducted into the Hall of Fame by fellow The Outsider member Kevin Nash. Hall, similar to Roberts, spoke of his person issues with alcohol, and thanks Page for saving his life. Following the introduction two were joined on stage by fellow Kliq members, Triple H, Shawn Michaels and Sean Waltman.
Carlos Colón was introduced by his two sons Carlito, Eddie, and nephew Orlando Colón. Carlito before delivering his speech said that the WWE cut the amount of time he had to speak down, and it made him feel like he never really left the WWE.
The Ultimate Warrior was the final inductee into the 2014, inducted by Linda McMahon. At the end of the Warrior's speech he announced that he had signed a long-term contract that would allow him to serve as an ambassador for the WWE for several years to come.
Aftermath.
Although The Ultimate Warrior announced he signed a long-term contract with the WWE, his appearance at "Raw" the following Monday would be his final WWE appearance. Warrior died on April 8, 2014 in Scottsdale, Arizona. According to reports, Warrior clutched his chest and collapsed at 5:50 p.m. while walking to his car with his wife outside of their hotel in Arizona. He was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead at age 54. Warrior's colleagues said Warrior appeared frail during WrestleMania weekend, and said that he was sweating profusely and breathing heavily backstage. 
Following his death, the WWE created the Warrior Award, with the first award given at the 2015 Hall of Fame ceremony. The Warrior Award for those who have "exhibited unwavering strength and perseverance, and who lives life with the courage and compassion that embodies the indomitable spirit of the Ultimate Warrior."

1900 United States presidential election in Colorado

The 1900 United States presidential election in Colorado took place on November 6, 1900. All contemporary 45 states were part of the 1900 United States presidential election. Colorado voters chose four electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
Background.
In its early days as a state, Colorado had like the Plains States to its east been solidly Republican. However, with crises emerging in its agricultural sector from low wheat prices and a severe drought in 1888 and 1889, and the state’s underdevelopment leading to resentment of the Northeast, the new Populist Party was able to largely take over the state’s politics in the early 1890s. Aided by fusion with the minority Democratic Party and strong support for free silver in this state which produced over half of all American silver, the Populist Party under James B. Weaver in 1892 carried the state’s presidential electoral votes and won both its congressional seats. After the Republicans gained a 130-seat majority in the House of Representatives following the 1894 elections, five dissident Republicans from the Mountain States who supported free silver jointed together as the “Silver Republicans” They supported nominating Centennial State Senator Teller at first, but ultimately this was viewed as impractical and the Silver Republicans fused with Democrat/Populist William Jennings Bryan, who won Colorado by six-and-a-half-to-one over William McKinley.
Following the election, the Populist majority in Colorado largely faded after the ensuing return to prosperity. However, Colorado and other Mountain States became opposed to the Philippine–American War, which they viewed as an imperialist land grab, which maintained substantial support for Bryan although free silver had largely disappeared as an important issue except within the silver-mining industry.
Vote.
One week before the election, the GOP had given up trying to carry Colorado, and ultimately Bryan won the state by 13.39 percentage points, which was nonetheless only two-elevenths of his 1896 margin. Bryan had previously won Colorado against William McKinley four years earlier and would later also win the state against William Howard Taft in 1908.

She helped establish annual art exhibitions with the Warrandyte Women's Auxiliary Association, serving on a committee of resident artists as secretary.
She was a founding member of the group, "Twenty Melbourne Painters Society", that was formed by students and followers of Australian Tonalist Max Meldrum. Sweatman was considered to be one of Australia's most famous painters of wattle. She has works in the collections of the Hamilton Gallery, Castlemaine Art Museum, and the National Gallery of Victoria. 
In 1922 Sweatman was a finalist for the Archibald Prize for her "Portrait Miss A.M.E. Bale". The same year A.M.E. Bale was a finalist with her portrait of "Miss Jo Sweatman". Sweatman died in 1956.

100 Greatest NHL Players

In 2017, the National Hockey League commemorated its 100th anniversary with a list of the 100 Greatest NHL Players. The list was created by 58 people, including media members, NHL alumni and NHL executives. The list is in alphabetical order rather than ranked.
The first 33, representing players who played prior to 1966, were unveiled during a pre-game ceremony at the NHL Centennial Classic outdoor game on January 1, 2017. The remaining players were announced on January 27, 2017, at a special "NHL 100 Gala" ceremony held at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, two days before the 2017 NHL All-Star Game.
Reaction.
The inclusion of Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane was considered controversial. Evgeni Malkin, Ed Belfour, Dale Hawerchuk, Joe Thornton, Jarome Iginla, Zdeno Chara, Pierre Pilote and Michel Goulet were considered to be notable players omitted from the list. Malkin responded to his omission by joking that he could be the 101st best player, and remarked that all who were featured on the list earned the honour.

List of UK top-ten albums in 1990

The UK Albums Chart is one of many music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling albums of the week in the United Kingdom. Before 2004, the chart was only based on the sales of physical albums. This list shows albums that peaked in the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart during 1990, as well as albums which peaked in 1989 and 1991 but were in the top 10 in 1990. The entry date is when the album appeared in the top 10 for the first time (week ending, as published by the Official Charts Company, which is six days after the chart is announced).
One-hundred and nineteen albums were in the top ten this year. Fourteen albums from 1989 remained in the top 10 for several weeks at the beginning of the year, or re-entered during the year, while "I'm Your Baby Tonight" by Whitney Houston and "The Singles Collection 1984/1990" by Jimmy Somerville were both released in 1990 but did not reach their peak until 1991. "Forever Your Girl" by Paula Abdul, "Hangin' Tough" by New Kids on the Block, "Journeyman" by Eric Clapton, "Labour of Love II" by UB40 and "Sleeping with the Past" by Elton John were the albums from 1989 to reach their peak in 1990. Eleven artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 1990. Alannah Miles, Betty Boo, The Charlatans and The Sundays were among the many artists who achieved their first UK charting top 10 album in 1990.
The 1989 Christmas number-one album, "...But Seriously" by Phil Collins, remained at number-one for the first 3 weeks of 1990. The first new number-one album of the year was "Colour" by The Christians. Overall, seventeen different albums peaked at number-one in 1990, with Luciano Pavarotti (2) having the most albums hit that position.

Windows (O'Donel Levy album)

Windows is an album by American jazz guitarist O'Donel Levy recorded in 1976 and released on the Groove Merchant label.
Reception.
Allmusic's Jason Ankeny said: "Following on the heels of George Benson's crossover blockbuster "Breezin"', "Windows" casts O'Donel Levy in the same mainstream, fusion-inspired mold, complete with vocals. To Levy's credit, the album never feels like a sell-out bid, and if anything, the mellow context underscores the chromatic beauty of his singular guitar aesthetic. With its bold, lush arrangements, the album at times boasts a cinematic splendor calling to mind the blaxploitation sound. Inasmuch as funk is ever subtle, "Windows" is ripe with nuance and resonance, yet never falls prey to the sleepiness of smooth jazz".

Hanbun, Aoi

 is a Japanese television drama series and the 98th Asadora series, following "Warotenka". It premiered on April 2, 2018, and concluded on September 29, 2018. Mei Nagano was cast in the lead role of Suzume Nireno after an audition of 2366 women.
Plot.
Suzume Nireno and Ritsu Hagio were born on the same day in 1971 in a small town in Gifu Prefecture. They grow up as close friends, with Suzume encouraging the smart but shy Ritsu, and Ritsu protecting Suzume, who lost hearing in one ear due to an illness. They are still close in high school, but their first romantic interests are directed at other people: for Ritsu, a beautiful girl in the archery club of another school; for Suzumu, a kind boy also from another school. Nothing much comes of either as they and their friends have to think of life after high school. Suzume plans to work but is only able to get a job at the local farmer's coop thanks to her grandfather's connections. Ritsu, however, has been lending her the shojo manga of Haori Akikaze, which inspire Suzume to draw her own manga.
When she meets Akikaze in person—who turns out to be a man—and shows him her work, he suddenly asks her to come work for him. She has to battle with her mother to let her go to Tokyo, but when she begins working for Akikaze, she finds out the main reason he hired her was for the rice treats her grandfather made. She convinces him to give her a test to earn her place as an apprentice. Meanwhile, Ritsu too is in Tokyo attending college and has made friends with Masato. Akikaze fires Suzume when he thinks she has thrown out an important draft of a manga, but when he discovers he just misplaced it, he travels to Gifu to bring her back and finally begin her real training as a manga artist. Around then, Ritsu re-encounters Saya, the archery girl, and the two begin dating. Suzume also begins to fall in love with Masato, but he rejects her, thinking she really belongs with Ritsu. But with Saya having grown jealous of Suzume, Ritsu decides to end all contact with Suzume.
The two rejections are a double whammy for Suzume, but Akikaze encourages her to express her feelings in creating manga. She, Yūko, and Makoto—Akikaze's apprentices—compete for a famous newcomer award, which Makoto wins, but has to withdraw after he earns Akikaze's ire for publishing another manga in a disreputable magazine. The award then goes to Suzume, who along with Yūko, gets to draw her first serialized manga. After several years, Yūko is the first to hit the brick wall and can't think of a new manga and ends up quitting. Suzume visits Gifu for the first time in a while and runs into Ritsu, who has broken up with Saya. He suddenly asks her to marry him, but she says it is impossible. She meant it was impossible at that time, but he took it differently. Soon afterwards Suzume's serialization also ends, but she gets additional bad news when she learns Ritsu has gotten married.
Always weak in storytelling, Suzume also fails to think of a new manga and quits. It's 1999 and she is 28 years old, so with no other prospects, she ends up working at a dollar store. There she meets Ryoji, the nephew of the three women who own the store. He's a budding filmmaker, working for the often-out-of-work director named Shohei Motosumiyoshi. Ryoji soon falls in love with Suzume. They decide to get married, and when Ryoji writes a screenplay based on a popular novel, he thinks this his chance to debut as a director, but Motosumiyoshi takes the job. Ryoji gives up on becoming a director and devotes himself to Suzume and their daughter Kano. A few years later, however, he catches the filmmaking bug again and, against Suzume's protests, leaves her and his daughter to pursue his career. Suzume returns to Gifu to find out that her younger brother Shota had revived the family restaurant with a new menu.
She also meets Ritsu again, who is in town looking after his sick mother Wako. Suzume decides to start a food stand selling goheimochi, learning the secret recipe from her grandfather Senkichi before he dies. She also helps Ritsu when Wako dies and even helps him mend ways with his wife, even though she still loves him. Learning of a place in Tokyo that lets you market your ideas on a small scale, and believing Kano has potential as an ice skater, Suzume decides to return to Tokyo. Things do not go well, however, as the company she works for goes under and her product ideas seem to go nowhere. But she does run into not only Masato, but also Ritsu, who has gotten divorced.
Teaming up with Ritsu, who quits his job, Suzume develops the idea of creating a fan that creates what feels like a natural, not artificial breeze. Ryoji reappears and helps them by making a promotional video, but Suzume rejects his proposal to reunite. After many experiments, Suzume and Ritsu finally succeed in creating a natural fan, but on the day they present it to investors, the Tōhoku earthquake happens. Suzume is shocked to hear that her friend Yūko died in the disaster, but she is determined to keep going, this time with Ritsu as her partner in life.

Austin P. Cristy

Austin Phelps Cristy (May 8, 1850 – December 1, 1926) was a newspaper publisher. He was born in Morristown, Vermont, to John Baker Cristy and Louisa Lydia Cristy, née Cooke. He attended Reading High School in Reading, Massachusetts, and Monson Academy in Wilbraham. He was at Amherst College for three terms in 1869 and 1870, but did not graduate there; he gained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Dartmouth College, graduating in 1873. He was admitted to the bar in about 1874 and began practicing law in Marblehead, then opened a law office in Worcester the following year. From 1882 to September 1884 he was assistant clerk of the Central District Court in Worcester.
He founded the "Worcester Sunday Telegram", with the first issue appearing on November 30, 1884, followed by the "Daily Telegram" two years later. He focused on sensational stories, emphasizing crimes and scandals, and was also a Republican, often attacking Democrats in the pages of the newspaper. He made political enemies during his time at the Central District Court, and later said that "The Telegram was started to square accounts with those who had been hostile". He also crusaded against alcohol, though a rival paper once reported he had been brought to their offices while drunk.
The paper was a success, and he remained editor and owner until he sold the paper to Theodore T. Ellis in 1920 for $1,000,000. Ellis had worked in the "Telegram"'s pressroom, but Cristy let him go because Ellis was working on inventions to improve the printing process and Cristy asked him to either stop or resign. Ellis's inventions were successful and made enough money for him to purchase the paper from Cristy.
He published a guide book for his reporters, and his sayings, such as "The body of a person drowned should not be called a floater. No dead body should be called a stiff." became known as Cristyisms.
On May 26, 1876 Cristy married Mary Elizabeth Bassett; she died in November 1913 and he remarried on January 12, 1915, to Katherine V. Horan. He had three sons, Horace, Austin, and Roger, and two daughters, Mary and Edna, all by his first marriage.
He attempted to commit suicide on November 29, 1926, possibly because of financial problems, though it may have been because of concerns over his health. He shot himself near the heart with a revolver, in the office of a broker. He died of his wounds two days later.

Wild About Harry (2000 film)

Wild About Harry is a 2000 British comedy film directed by Declan Lowney and written by Colin Bateman. The film stars Brendan Gleeson, Amanda Donohoe, James Nesbitt, Adrian Dunbar, Bronagh Gallagher and Ruth McCabe. The film was released on 26 October 2001 by United International Pictures.
Plot.
Harry McKee is a successful television chef for a regional broadcaster. Although he has been in the newspapers a lot because of his alcoholic chap, he is very popular with viewers. In his private life, however, things look different for him: his wife Ruth, whom he has betrayed several times, wants to divorce him. Somewhat emotionally agitated, he exposes local politician Walter Adair in his cooking show by making fun of his sexual preferences. Harry collapses in the ensuing court case, in which the details of his divorce are to be clarified.
When he wakes up after a few days in a coma, Harry suffers from amnesia. The last 25 years seem to have been erased from his memory. He is now in the same hospital as the politician Adair, who has had to seek treatment since fleeing from intrusive journalists and falling from a bridge.
Although Harry's wife and children do not really want to believe him and consider amnesia to be a ploy to delay the divorce, they take him back home. Using old photo albums, they try to refresh his memory. On the advice of the doctors, however, they hide his TV cooking career from him.
However, he is informed about this by his friend and lawyer. He also learns from him that his wife wants to divorce him. Although Harry's complete memory has not yet come back, his unit manager urges him to get back to the cooking shows. During the first show a viewer suddenly disrupts the process. It is Walter Adair, disguised as a woman, who draws a gun and threatens Harry. The program will then also go live on national channels. The meanwhile refined cook wants to give himself up to his fate when suddenly Ruth appears. After she succeeds in disarming Adair, she promises Harry to make up with him again. However, she insists on the divorce and challenges him to reconsider his life. Only when he was absolutely sure that he wanted a future together with her should he contact her again. Harry predicts that he will contact her the same day and ends - as if nothing had happened - his cooking show by announcing the guests of the next show.

True Montenegro

The True Montenegro (; abbr. Права / Prava or ПЦГ / PCG) is a right-wing populist political party in Montenegro, formed in January 2018 from the political movement "Resistance to Hopelessness" (OB), prior to the March 2018 presidential election. Its founder and current leader is Marko Milačić, former journalist and political activist.
History.
After a series of unsuccessful attempts by the entire opposition to nominate a common candidate for 2018 presidential election executive board of newly formed "True Montenegro" has decided to support the previously-announced candidacy of the party leader Marko Milačić for President of Montenegro. After handing over more than 8,000 signatures of support to Montenegrin State Electoral Commission on 8 March, Milačić started his presidential campaign under the slogan "Bravely, (there has been) enough waiting".
Milačić came fourth in the election, winning 2.8% of the votes. In July 2020, the party joined the right-wing Democratic Front alliance for the 2020 Montenegrin parliamentary election, receiving one representative in the parliament, which elected from the common opposition For the Future of Montenegro list.
In November 2020, the party single MP Marko Milačić left the Democratic Front parliamentary group, continuing to support the formation of the new government. On 8 December 2020, President of the Political Council of the True Montenegro Željko Savović was named Advisor for the Internal Affairs to the Prime Minister of Montenegro Zdravko Krivokapić.
Ideology.
The public appearance of the True Montenegro party is based on social conservativism, traditionalism, Serbian–Montenegrin unionism and frequent right-wing populist and nationalist rhetoric. The party views the Serb community, which it represents, as discriminated against. It sees Montenegro as pursuing the concept of a nation-state and the politics of assimilation. The main goals of the party is to overthrow the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists of Milo Đukanović, which has been in power since the introduction of multi-party system, withdrawal Montenegro from NATO, proclamation of military neutrality and withdrawal of Montenegro soldiers from all military missions abroad.
Party leader Milačić maintains cooperation with certain regional public personalities, such as Croatian MP Ivan Pernar, Bosnian conceptual artist and activist Damir Nikšić and Serbian Canadian filmmaker Boris Malagurski.

Shilabhattarika

Shila-bhattarika (IAST: Śīlābhaṭṭārikā) was a 9th-century Sanskrit poet from present-day India. Her verses appear in most major Sanskrit anthologies, and her poetic skills have been praised by the medieval Sanskrit literary critics.
Biography.
Shilabhattarika lived in the 9th century. One of her poems mentions the Narmada River (Reva) and the Vindhya mountains. Therefore, as a young woman, she probably lived along the Narmada River, near the Vindhyas. M. B. Padma, a scholar of the University of Mysore, speculates that she may be same as Shila-mahadevi, the queen of the 8th century Rashtrakuta ruler Dhruva. Padma's theory is based on the facts that the suffix "Bhattarika" attached to the poet's name indicates her high social status, and that the queen is known to have made generous grants to scholars.
The 10th century poet Rajashekhara praises Shilabhattarika as a leading figure of the "Panchali" literary style (one of the four major contemporary literary styles - the other three being "Vaidharbhi", "Gaudi", and "Lati"). A verse, attributed to Rajashekhara in Vallabhadeva's 15th century anthology "Subhashitavali", states that this style maintains "a balance between words and meaning". According to Rajashekhara, the "Panchali" style can be traced to the works of Shilabhattarika, and possibly in some of the works of the 7th century poet Bana.
Shilabhattarika has been quoted by several classical Sanskrit literary critics, and her verses appear in most major Sanskrit anthologies. She is known to have written at least 46 poems on topics such as "love, morality, politics, nature, beauty, the seasons, insects, anger, indignation, codes of conduct, and the characteristic features of various kinds of heroines." However, most of her works are now lost, and only six of her short poems are extant.
"Sharngadhara-paddhati", a 14th century anthology, praises her and three other female poets in the following words:
Example verses.
The following short poem of Shilabhattarika is considered as one of the greatest poems ever written in the Sanskrit tradition. Indian scholar Supriya Banik Pal believes that the poem expresses the speaker's anxiety to be reunited with her husband. According to American author Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, the poetess, possibly a middle-aged woman, implies that the illicit, pre-marital love between her and her lover was richer than their love as a married couple. An interpretation by the 16-century philosopher Chaitanya suggests that the verse is a metaphor for a person's desire to be united with the "Supreme Lord - the Absolute".
The following verse expresses the speaker's longing for his wife:
In the following verse, a poor speaker expresses grief at not being able to provide his loved one with jewels or food:
The following verse, also quoted in the "Subhashita Ratna Bhandagara", describes the importance of learning and engaging in discussions with scholars:

3 from Hell

3 from Hell is a 2019 American horror film written, co-produced, and directed by Rob Zombie. It is the third installment in the "Firefly" trilogy, which began with "House of 1000 Corpses" (2003), and stars Sheri Moon Zombie, Bill Moseley, Richard Brake and Sid Haig. Ten years have passed since the events of "The Devil's Rejects" (2005). The plot follows an incarcerated Otis Driftwood and Baby Firefly being freed by Otis's half-brother, after barely surviving a police shootout a decade ago.
Unlike the previous installments, "3 from Hell" was given a special three-night theatrical engagement through Fathom Events from September 16–18, 2019, and it received a mixed response from film critics. Since it grossed nearly $2 million, Fathom Events gave it a one-night release on October 14, before the film was released on home video the following day. This was the last film of Haig's that was released in his lifetime, before his death on September 21, 2019; only five days after the film's release.
Plot.
The film opens with several news reports about the Firefly family's murderous rampage. Through the reports, it is revealed that Baby, Otis, and Captain Spaulding miraculously survived their shootout with the police and that they will be tried for their crimes. The trial is widely covered nationwide and becomes a cause célèbre, resulting in the organization of protests that insist the trio's innocence. Numerous fanatics also adopt the chant "Free the Three", claiming that their crimes were committed as a means to fight against the system. Despite this, all three are found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. In addition to the final verdict, Captain Spaulding is executed via lethal injection. Otis' half-brother, Winslow Foxworth "Foxy" Coltrane, shows up to help Otis escape from prison while he is outside doing work on a chain gang. In the process, Otis kills Rondo, who was also on the chain gang after having been arrested some time after the end of the previous film and been sent to the same prison, but did not recognize Otis. Meanwhile, Baby unsuccessfully seeks parole, as her mental state has further deteriorated since her incarceration.
Once free, Otis and Foxy begin planning to free Baby from prison. To accomplish this, they kidnap the family and friends of the prison's warden, Virgil Dallas Harper. Otis and Foxy demand that Harper help Baby sneak out of prison or they will murder everyone they hold hostage. Harper follows their commands and sneaks Baby out of prison by disguising her as a guard. However, once Baby is freed, Otis and Foxy decide to eliminate the loose ends and kill all the hostages, as well as Harper. Now united, the three are undecided as to what to do next but eventually decide to flee to Mexico, a decision that is made more pressing due to Baby's growing instability.
Otis, Baby, and Foxy manage to successfully cross the border and flee to a small town in Mexico that is celebrating the Day of the Dead and hole up in the town's lone hotel. They briefly worry about being recognized but dismiss these concerns, unaware that the hotel's owner has in fact recognized them and has alerted Rondo's son, Aquarius, to their location. The owner keeps them occupied with both the celebration and local prostitutes, while Aquarius heads out to the location with several henchmen in tow. The following morning, Baby bonds with a local worker, Sebastian, who notices Aquarius's arrival. He warns Baby of the danger before running to warn Otis, just as Aquarius's men break into the whorehouse. Otis and Sebastian hold off the attackers until Foxy arrives and rescues them both. Otis separates from them, managing to successfully find the hotel owner and kill him. During this time, Baby manages to kill several of Aquarius's men using a bow and arrow set she took from Harper's house. Eventually, Foxy and Baby are outmatched by Aquarius and taken prisoner. During this, Aquarius tells Sebastian he's not worth the bullet and leaves him for dead. Aquarius and his remaining goons use Baby and Foxy to draw Otis out into the open.
Otis appears and squares off against one of Aquarius's men in a knife fight, while Sebastian sneaks up and silently frees both Foxy and Baby. This enrages Aquarius, distracting his man in the knife fight and allowing Otis to gain the upper hand. He, Baby, and Foxy manage to overpower Aquarius; however, Sebastian is shot and killed in the process. The film ends with the trio immolating Aquarius before walking off into the Mexican town.
Production.
Principal photography began on March 13, 2018 and wrapped on April 10, 2018. The Sybil Brand Institute in Los Angeles, a decommissioned women's prison, served as one filming location.
Post-production was postponed five months to allow completion of Zombie's and Marilyn Manson's tour. The editing process began on September 11, 2018 with sound mixing commencing on March 15, 2019, and completed by the end of April.
According to Rob Zombie, Sid Haig was originally going to have a larger role, but was unable to commit for the whole film due to health issues. As a result, the script was rewritten to introduce Richard Brake's character to take his place. Haig passed away shortly after the film was released on September 21, 2019.
Music.
The soundtrack was composed by Zeuss and was released by Waxwork Records on vinyl.
Release.
The first trailer was released in June 2019. Fathom Events held an unrated three-day theatrical release from September 16–18, 2019. The first night featured a special video introduction with Zombie and a commemorative poster. The second featured a behind-the-scenes look at a making-of and all Cinemark locations will be distributing an exclusive bumper sticker designed by Zombie. The third night included a double feature of "3 from Hell" and "The Devil's Rejects".
The film earned $1.92 million which was successful enough that Fathom Events announced plans to return the film to theaters on October 14.
Critical response.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 58% based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 5.60/10. The website's critics consensus reads: ""3 from Hell" may be of interest to fans of the trilogy, but those not already on board with Rob Zombie's gory saga will find little to lure them in here." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 50 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
Scout Tafoya of RogerEbert.com awarded the film four out of four stars, referring to it as Zombie's "most earnest and laid back nightmare yet." Shawn Garrett of "Rue Morgue", while conceding that there are "no surprises here," deemed the film "a fitfully entertaining exercise in 'more of the same' as grimy crime film". Cody Hamman JoBlo.com awarded the film seven out of ten, writing: "While I do still wish the ending of "The Devil's Rejects" had been the end for these characters, I did find "3 from Hell" to be a decent sequel." During the premiere, Kevin Smith called the film "horror heaven."
Luke Y. Thompson of "Forbes" said of the main actors "all three deserve better than re-quel hell." Meagan Navarro of "Consequence of Sound" wrote, "Having been down these exact same roads before, the climax is bereft of any tension and stakes...by the time the end credits roll, you feel it." A.A. Dowd of "The A.V. Club" found the film unnecessary, giving it a D+ and calling it "a slow death by nostalgia." Similarly, John Squires of Bloody Disgusting awarded the film one-and-a-half skulls out of five, writing: ""3 from Hell" is proof that sometimes in horror, dead really is better." "Comics Beat" reviewer Edward Douglas deemed the film "easily, the worst movie of the year."
Home media.
It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 15, 2019. Streaming rights are exclusive to Shudder, to which it was added on February 13, 2020.

WWE Hall of Fame (2017)

WWE Hall of Fame (2017) was the event which featured the introduction of the 18th class to the WWE Hall of Fame. The event was produced by WWE on March 31, 2017 from the Amway Center in Orlando, Florida. The event took place the same weekend as WrestleMania 33. This was the first time the Hall of Fame ceremony was not held the night before WrestleMania instead was held the night before WrestleMania. The event aired live on the WWE Network, and was hosted by Jerry Lawler. A condensed one-hour version of the ceremony aired the following Monday after "Raw" on the USA Network.
Background.
On January 16, 2017, WWE announced that Angle would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. As a celebrated amateur wrestler, Angle had an aversion to professional wrestling, considering it "beneath" him. He was offered a 10-year contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) following the 1996 Olympics, but talks fell apart when he told company chairman Vince McMahon that he would be unwilling to lose any matches. Angle's opinion of professional wrestling changed when he began watching the WWF's "Monday Night Raw" in 1998: he observed "world class athletes doing very athletic things", and developed an admiration for Stone Cold Steve Austin's talents as an entertainer. Angle later conceded that his negative attitude toward the industry was misguided and "stupid". Angle was signed to a five-year deal by August 1998, following a three-day tryout. On August 25, 2006, Angle was granted an early release from his WWE contract because of health reasons. Angle stated in the "Kurt Angle: Champion" documentary DVD that he asked for his release from WWE because he could not take time off and was working hurt, severely on some occasions. He also stated that when he quit, WWE lost their top talent, as he was at the very top of the payroll. Following his release, Angle did not reappear on any WWE programming until his Hall of Fame induction.
Event.
Due to the launch of the WWE Network shortly before WrestleMania XXX, this event featured the fourth "Red Carpet" event as a one-hour pre-show prior to the start of the event. The pre-show was hosted by Michael Cole, and Maria Menounos.
In 2016, WWE introduced a new category for the Hall of Fame called the "Legacy" wing. Inductees under this new category feature wrestlers from the early years of professional wrestling, primarily during the early part of the 20th century. All inductees in 2017 were inducted posthumously and were recognized with a video package at the ceremony. Those inducted in the 2017 legacy category were Martin "Farmer" Burns, June Byers, Haystacks Calhoun, Judy Grable, Dr. Jerry Graham, Luther Lindsay, Joseph "Toots" Mondt, Rikidōzan, and Bearcat Wright.
Following The Ultimate Warrior's death in April 2014, WWE introduced the Warrior Award, in 2015, for those who have "exhibited unwavering strength and perseverance, and who lives life with the courage and compassion that embodies the indomitable spirit of the Ultimate Warrior." As is the normal case, his widow Dana Hellweg presented the award. The 2017 inductee was Eric LeGrand. LaGrand was recognized for being a former Rutgers University football player. After LeGrand was paralyzed in 2010, rather than letting it defeat him, he became a motivational speaker.
Theodore Long was inducted by his long time travel-mates The APA (John "Bradshaw" Layfield and Ron Simmons). During the induction ceremony Layfield and Simmons shared memories of Long on the road, and how he never was willing to pay for anything, and how much money he owed them.
Diamond Dallas Page was inducted by his former boss Eric Bischoff. During his induction speech, Page spoke about how much Dusty Rhodes, who had died two years prior, meant to him, and helped guide his career.
Natalya inducted her best friend Beth Phoenix. The two shared stories of how their careers started and how much the other meant to them and how it got them both where they are too. Phoenix went to introduce her husband however she was interrupted by Tony Chimel who offered to help her, and then announced Edge. Phoenix also shared stories about Edge and stories of them from before they retired.
"Ravishing" Rick Rude was inducted by Ricky Steamboat. Due to Rude's passing in 1999, Rude's induction was posthumously accepted by his widow Michelle and his two surviving children, daughter Merissa and son Rick Rood, Jr.
The Rock 'n' Roll Express members Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson were inducted by Jim Cornette. Cornette shared stories of managing them during their early years. Gibson and Morton discussed what it was like to travel with each other for so many years, and discussed how they are as close as brothers.
Kurt Angle was the final member to be inducted, with his induction being done by John Cena. This event marked Angle's return to the WWE after an over 10-year absence. Angle roasted himself during his speech, referencing many of his old bits, including singing "I'm Just a Sexy Kurt" and finished by chugging two bottles of milk.
Aftermath.
On the April 3 episode of "Raw" after WrestleMania, Angle made his first WWE appearance in nearly 11 years after Mr. McMahon appointed Angle as the new general manager of Raw. On October 20, WWE announced Angle's in-ring return after 11 years, replacing Roman Reigns due to medical issues and teaming with Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins to face The Miz, Cesaro, Sheamus, Braun Strowman, and Kane in a 5-on-3 handicap Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match at .

Journal de Chimie Physique

Journal de Chimie Physique ("JCP") was a peer-reviewed scientific journal of physical chemistry. It appeared between 1903 until 1999.
At the end of the journal's life, it was published by EDP Sciences, who was that the end of the journal was a "part of a general trend to replace national publications with international (European) ones to better compete with American publications." EDP Sciences expected the areas covered by "JCP" now be covered by into "ChemPhysChem" published by Wiley-VCH on behalf of the French and German Chemical Societies, and were looking to increase coverage of chemical physics in "European Physical Journal D" and "European Physical Journal E".

Mamman Daura

Mamman Daura (born 1939) is a Nigerian newspaper editor who edited and later managed the "New Nigerian" from 1969 to 1975. He is a nephew of President Muhammadu Buhari; and a prominent member of the infamous Kaduna Mafia, a loose group of Nigerian businessmen, civil servants, intellectuals and military officers from Northern Nigeria. 
Life.
Mamman Daura was born in Daura, Northern Region, British Nigeria in 1939, his father Alhaji Dauda Daura held the traditional title of "Durbin Daura" of the Daura Emirate; and was Muhammadu Buhari's elder brother. He was educated at Daura Elementary School, Katsina Middle School before attending Provincial Secondary School, Okene. In 1956, at the age of 17, he started working with the Daura Native Authority for a couple of years before joining the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation. He was one of six northerners selected by Sir Ahmadu Bello to study in England. 
From 1962 to 1967, he read economics and politics at Trinity College, Dublin. On his return in 1967, he spent a year as an assistant in the Cabinet of Northern Nigeria, before returning to Dublin for a masters degree in business and public administration. In 1968, Adamu Ciroma, editor of the "New Nigerian" was looking to recruit qualified and educated northern Nigerians for the newspaper. One of those recruits was Daura who was just finishing his masters degree in Dublin. Daura was hesitant to take the position and returned to the northern civil service as a political secretary working in the office of General Abba Kyari the military governor of North-Central State.
In April 1969, he finally joined the "New Nigerian", replacing Adamu Ciroma as the paper's new editor. The first two years of his stewardship was a focus on coverage of issues affecting Northerners and protection of northern interests. In 1974, he later became the managing director of the paper's holding company. When General Murtala Mohammed's administration opted to take over the ownership of the paper, Daura soon left the company and retired into private business.

Pynk

"Pynk" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Janelle Monáe for her third studio album, "Dirty Computer" (2018). It features Canadian art pop musician Grimes and interpolates the song "Pink" by Aerosmith, with members of the band being credited as co-writers. Lyrically, the song continues Monáe's female empowerment theme previously expressed in "Django Jane". The third single from "Dirty Computer", a music video for the song was uploaded to YouTube on April 10, 2018.
Background.
Monáe describes the song as, "a celebration of creation, self love, sexuality and pussy power", and that the color pink "unites all of humanity" because it is the color "found in the deepest and darkest nooks and crannies of humans everywhere."
Critical reception.
“Pynk” received critical acclaim. Pitchfork praised "Pynk" and awarded it Best New Track. Eve Barlow stated: "As an expression of unity and an appeal to see people beyond gender, the song’s genre-bending sonics and the video’s femme-dominated utopia underscore Monáe’s long-held desires for a more fluid society."
Music video.
The music video was directed by Emma Westenberg and was uploaded to Monáe's YouTube account on April 10, 2018. It features actress Tessa Thompson, a frequent collaborator of Monáe's. The plot finds Monáe and Thompson along with a group of other women dancing in a desert, having a slumber party and sitting out by a pool while expressing appreciation for the vagina. The distinctive pink vulva trousers worn by the dancers were designed by Duran Lantink.

Jacob Balthasar Peeters

Jacob Balthasar Peeters, also known as Jacob Peeters or Jacobus Peeters (1660-61 – after 1721) was a Flemish painter who specialized in architectural paintings depicting imaginary Renaissance and Baroque palaces populated with elegant figures wearing exotic clothes and headgear and shown in theatrical, stage-like postures. Peeters also painted realistic interiors of existing churches with staffage.
Life.
Very little is known about the life and career of Jacob Balthasar Peeters. Some confusion about the facts of his life is caused by the fact that the name Jacob or Jacobus Peeters was quite common at the time, and there appears to have been at least one other contemporary Jacobus Peeters who was also a painter active in Antwerp. It is not clear when or where he was born. As he was mentioned as being 22 years old in a document dated 28 May 1683, he must have been born in 1660 or 1661. He was likely born in Antwerp as his father Daniel was a master of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke. His mother was Martina Wouters.
A Jacobus Peeters was registered in the guild year 1672-72 at the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as a pupil of the painter Peter van de Velde. A Jacobus Peeters is also mentioned as a pupil in the guild year 1675–76.It is not clear with which of these pupils Jacob Balthasar Peeters should be identified but it is more likely he was the latter one. On 28 May 1683, his mother and the marine and landscape painter Hendrik van Minderhout entered into a one-year contract pursuant to which van Minderhout was to teach Jacob to draw and paint. The contract further stipulated that "He will learn for a year, in the summer from 7am to 6pm, in the winter from 8am until the fall of darkness. He will paint landscapes and staffage. Outside of his working hours he is allowed to draw, sketch and paint after the works of his master, also on Sundays and holidays, for his own profit. The cost is 100 guilder, a possible second term costs 15 Flemish pounds.
In the guild year 1688–1689 Peeters became a master in the Guild as a 'wijnmeester', i.e. the son of a master. Elected in 1695 to serve as dean of the Guild, he preferred to pay the fixed contribution of 360 guilders to be exempted from this charge. He may possibly be identified with the Jacobus Peeters constschilder (painter) who makes together with his wife Barbara Christina Witten a will on 7 June 1699, while living on Kipdorp near the St. James Church. If that is the case, the couple had at least one son Henricus Josephus who was an Augustine monk in Antwerp. 
His pupils included Jan-Baptist van Isschot, Jan Baptist van der Straeten, Jan Carel Vierpeyl, Rombaut Bacx and Nicolaas Gillis.
The date and place of his death are not known. The artist is usually described as being active from circa 1673 to circa 1721 in Antwerp. A pair of paintings depicting the interiors of the Jesuit Church in Antwerp and signed and dated 1721 are evidence that the artist was still alive in that year. If he is the Jacobus Peeter who was the widower of Barbara Christina Witten, he made his will as a widower on 20 November 1753, when he must have been already 92 or 93 years of age.
Work.
Jacob Balthasar Peeters was a specialist painter of imaginary Renaissance and Baroque palaces and paintings of existing churches. Peeters would place among these imaginary or existing structures and outdoor settings elegant figures, usually wearing exotic hats and costumes, together with their, often black, pages and with dogs running around.
As was common practice in Antwerp artistic practice of that period, Peeters collaborated with other artists. A pair of paintings depicting "Fantastic courtly architecture with staffage" (Hampel Munich auction of 25 September 2014, lot 679) constitute a collaborative effort of Peeters and Hendrik van Minderhout. Van Minderhout was a Dutch painter active in Antwerp who often contributed the figures to works by local landscape and perspective painters including Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg. The aforementioned pair of pictures, which were made to be hung next to each other, demonstrate the fantastic, almost surreal, aspects of Peeters' imaginary views. One of the canvases provides an idealized view of a palace with round arched loggias supported by columns and the other of a courtly façade with a portico and a balustrade on top. The buildings are placed respectively on the left and right and disappear in the distance with foreshortening at the rear. Each painting continues onto a view of an idealized park landscape with a large pond on which float pleasure ships with swans as figureheads. The backdrop is a blue sky with brightly lit, white-gray clouds. The artist enlivened the scene by having light fall through the loggia arches, which contrasts with the architectural façade, which is in the shade. Groups of figures in the foreground include ladies and gentlemen who are as fanciful as the architecture. The figures are shown in theatrical, stage-like postures, some engaged in conversation. The ladies have towering hairdos and the gentlemen wear turbans or feathered helmets. A black servant carries the train of one of the ladies' dresses. A guard holding a lance is reclining against the façade of one of the palaces. Some dogs are running among these figures.
Jacob Balthasar Peeters painted a number of church interiors including of the Jesuit churches of Bruges and Antwerp. This theme was popular in the Low Countries throughout the 17th century. Antwerp artists preferred depicting interiors of high baroque interiors while Dutch artists concentrated on the barren interiors of Protestant churches despoiled of their decorations. In comparison to the earlier church interiors of Flemish and Dutch masters, Peeters' church interiors reflect 18th century artistic preferences through the addition of elegant figures and their attention to detail. One pair of works in the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen dated 1714 depicts the interior of the Jesuit St. Charles Borromeo Church in Antwerp. A pair of views of the same church were recently on the art market (Lempertz Cologne auction of 19 November 2016). The works created in 1721 show the church in the state before part of its decoration was destroyed by fire on 18 July 1718. In the fire, the interior of the church, including ceiling murals painted by Peter Paul Rubens, was destroyed. Peeters was able to include the lost decorations in these two compositions by using his own compositions which predated the fire such as the works now in the Statens Museum for Kunst.
Peeters' work shows a strong similarity with other Flemish architecture painters of his time such as Jacobus Ferdinandus Saey and Peeters' own pupil Jan Baptist van der Straeten. The similarities are such that the works of these artists can often not be easily distinguished from each other. A painting depicting the (Buckinghamshire County Museum, Aylesbury) was possibly painted by Jacob Balthasar Peeters or Anton Gunther Gheringh, another architectural painter active in Antwerp.

Patrick Mailata

Patrick Pakuliki Mailata (; born 31 December 1994) is a Samoan born, New Zealand raised professional boxer. As an amateur, he won three New Zealand national elite championships from 2012 to 2014 and a bronze medal at the 2018 Commonwealth Games.
Early life.
Patrick Pakuliki Mailata was born on 31 December 1994 in Apia, a son of Fuatino Letu'u and Tauleave Lekuala Auapa'au Mailata. Growing up, Mailata was raised in the Samoan villages of Avao and A'ufaga before migrating to New Zealand along with his parents when he was only eight years old. He lived in the South Auckland area, and was educated at Papakura High School, where he was head boy. Mailata excelled in rugby league, but suffered a knee injury that forced him to stop competing. He then discovered boxing and passed up offers from National Rugby League clubs to focus on the sport.
Amateur career.
Mailata participated at the Papatoetoe Boxing Club of Grant Arkell, and fought fellow countryman Joseph Parker twice at the start of his amateur career. At an early age he became a three-time New Zealand amateur heavyweight champion in 2012, 2013, and 2014, as well as winning several amateur tournaments. Mailata competed throughout Auckland and fought at the AIBA Youth World Boxing Championships at Armenia in 2012 but was disqualified for putting his head lower than his Cuban opponent's belt.

Chief Chronicler of the Kingdom of Portugal

Chief Chronicler of the Kingdom () was a courtly position in the Kingdom of Portugal, formally instituted in 1434 by King Edward I. The Chief Chronicler was the official authority on Portuguese historiography, and the post was soon associated to the post of Keeper of the Royal Archives, already centralised in an autonomous way in the 1370s — a singularity in late medieval history in both its precocious creation and organisation.
The first to occupy the position was Fernão Lopes, in 1434. The last occupant was writer and politician Almeida Garrett, who was sacked in 1841, after fiercely criticising António José de Ávila (who was then Minister of the Exchequer), and no one was appointed to replace him. The following year, Minister of the Kingdom Costa Cabral issued a decree extinguishing the position of Chief Chronicler and transferring its responsibilities to the Keeper of the Royal Archives.

In his third year, Hardy was selected to be an intern with the Exploring the Arts' Tony Bennett Apprenticeship Program where he studied under the direction of the Latin Jazz Fusion Sweet Plantain string quartet; Eddie Venegas, Romulo Benavides, Orlando Wells, and David Gotay. In his senior year of high school, Hardy received both the 2010 Patrick Gallagher Performing Arts Award in Instrumental Music Talent Unlimited High School and the Chancellor's Endorsed Diploma for the Arts: The New York City Department of Education - Advanced Designation Through the Arts: Music. In recognition of an advanced level of achievement and the completion of a five-unit sequence of major study in partial fulfillment of the New York State Regents Diploma. After graduation, Hardy returned to Talent Unlimited High School to give private lessons to the violinists and violists later to perform regularly with the quartet. Hardy has become a “stunt violinist and violist of the Sweet Plantain String Quartet. Hardy has performed with Sweet Plantain around the country.
He was appointed Principal Violist of the Purchase Symphony Orchestra for three consecutive years. He was a student of Ira Weller of the Met Orchestra. In 2014, Hardy performed in two masterclasses; one led by violist Kim Kashkashian, Carmit Zori and cellist Julia Lichten of the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra at the Performing Arts Center’s Recital Hall at Purchase College. Hardy earned his bachelor's degree in Viola Performance with honors from the SUNY Purchase College Conservatory of Music.
Hardy found his love for theatre during his first undergraduate year at Purchase College. Although he was in the music conservatory, Hardy spent most of my time performing in plays presented by the acting conservatory. He composed for and performed in several plays, always in costume and on stage. By the end of his undergraduate career, Hardy fell in love with theater and with the idea of composing for theater.
Hardy often composed and performed for theatrical performances both on and off the Purchase College campus. He has performed in Three Sisters; Chekhov, Blues for an Alabama Sky; Cleage, Trojan Women; Euripides, Twelfth Night; Shakespeare, Mother Courage and Her Children; Brecht, Beautiful Dreamer; McElwaine/Foster, all under the instruction of his mentor; James (Jim) McElwaine.

He also performed in a masterclass with violinist Ida Kavafian at LeFrak Concert Hall in New York City. He was a student of Daniel Phillips of the Orion String Quartet Hardy earned his Masters of Music degree in Violin Performance with honors from CUNY, Queens College – Aaron Copland School of Music.

In 2014, Hardy performed as a guest solo violinist at the Charleston Museum under the button of Maestro Marlon Daniel and performed in the first violin section of The Black Stars of Broadway Concert led by Norm Lewis and Chapman Roberts. Months later Hardy took the stage as concertmaster of the Trilogy Opera Company at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center’s Victoria Theater. From an invitation from Marlon Daniel, Hardy was invited to perform in Ensemble du Monde and made his first appearance with the chamber ensemble in 2015 at Merkin Hall. Later that year, Hardy performed with Roderick Cox as the assistant concertmaster at the Colour of Music Orchestra at Gaillard Center in Charleston. In 2016, Hardy was commissioned to compose and perform a solo violin piece for the Congressional Black Caucus at Howard Theatre which was a private event, sponsored by Google, apart of the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. He composed and performed a piece called “Evolution” and also performed Antonio Vivaldi's Concerto No. 2 in G minor, Op. 8, RV 315, "L'estate" (Summer) with the Colour of Music Virtuosi led by Roderick Cox associate conductor of the Minnesota Orchestra. Hardy's solo violin piece "Evolution" made its televised debut on PBS, and on its affiliate stations American Music TV, in California and New York City.
"A Brooklyn Boy".
"A Brooklyn Boy" is a spoken word performance that portrays Steven Prescod's coming-of-age story. Hardy participated as the co-composer and solo violinist through two years of workshops until its final location at the East Village Playhouse in New York City. A Brooklyn Boy was workshopped in famous venues such as the National Black Theatre of Harlem, the Vineyard Theatre, at the Department of Education in Washington, D. C., The American Museum of Natural History, the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Marriott Marquis.
"The Woodsman".
In Hardy's junior year of 2012–13 at Purchase College, he started and finished composing all the music for the first edition of "The Woodsman" within two months. As each rendition of play developed and molded into something new the music reflected its transformation. Except for a brief introduction, The Woodsman does not have any words and is unlike any other play. During the first meeting with the playwright, both Hardy and Ortiz examined the synopsis of the play. This was Hardy's opportunity to think of this play like a silent film and tell a story through music. He explored different genres of music to create everything from the sound of nature to the different instruments in an orchestra. The program music plays a significant role in the play.”
"Edgar Allan Poe's Inspired Works".
Hardy composed “Three Pieces Inspired By Edgar Allan Poe”: Nevermore, Evil Eye and A Fantasy were recorded by Grammy award winner John Kilgore, Jonathan Jetter and produced by Jim McElwaine. Nevermore was premiered at Hardy's first one-man sold-out show “Six Violins: A Musical Evening with Edward W. Hardy” at the Cutting Room in NYC which also featured Hardy playing three his violins on WNYW - Fox 5 news.

Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown

Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown is an essay by Virginia Woolf published in 1924 which explores modernity.
History.
The writer Arnold Bennett had written a review of Woolf's "Jacob's Room" (1922) in "Cassell's Weekly" in March 1923, which provoked Woolf to rebut it. She recorded in her diary in June that Bennett accused her of writing about characters that couldn't survive. Her response was published in the United States in "Nation and Athenaeum" in December as "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown". The response encouraged her to develop her ideas of cultural relativism further. The following year she presented these ideas as a paper read to the Heretics Society at Cambridge University on 18 May 1924. T.S. Eliot, then editor of "The Criterion" asked her for an article, and she submitted her talk, which was published in July under the title "Character in Fiction" and then by the Hogarth Press on 30 October 1924 under its original title as No. 1 of the Hogarth Essays (1924–1926). The cover was illustrated by Vanessa Bell.
Premise.
Woolf addresses what she sees as the arrival of modernism, with the much cited phrase "that in or about December, 1910, human character changed", referring to Roger Fry's exhibition "Manet and the Post-Impressionists". She argued that this in turn led to a change in human relations, and thence to change in "religion, conduct, politics, and literature". She envisaged modernism as inherently unstable, a society and culture in flux. She develops her argument through the examination of two generations of writers. Mr. Bennett was a critic of not just Woolf, but modern writers in general. In particular, Bennett challenged modern writers' depiction of "reality".
Woolf throws out a challenge to Bennett:"Mr. Bennett says that it is only if the characters are real that the novel has any chance of surviving. Otherwise, die it must. But, I ask myself, what is reality? And who are the judges of reality?"
Her argument is that as times change, writers and the tools that they use must evolve, "the tools of one generation are useless to the next". She places Bennett in the Edwardians, and the subjects of his attacks as "Georgians" to reflect the change of monarch in 1910 that coincided with Fry's exhibition. She characterises Georgian writers in modernist terms as impressionistic, and those that are "telling the truth".
Her vision of reality is captured in the world of an anonymous woman she has observed, to whom she gives the name "Mrs. Brown", whose world is to be reflected by modernist writers.
Cover.
Bell's modernist cover design shown here was used for the entire essay series, depicting a woman reading, and whose hairs and clothing reflect 1920s style.
Reception.
"Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown" has become a key element of the analysis of Woolf's work but also twentieth century literature in general. It eventually contributed to a decline in Bennett's reputation.

Žeželj Bridge

Žeželj Bridge () is a tied-arch bridge on Danube river in Novi Sad, Vojvodina, Serbia. The bridge was originally built in 1961, only to be destroyed during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The newly constructed bridge was opened in 2018.
History.
The original Žeželj Bridge (377 meters long) was a through arch bridge built between 1957 and 1961. It was designed by the prominent Yugoslavian civil engineer Branko Žeželj and constructed by Mostogradnja. It connected the city area of Novi Sad and Petrovaradin. During its existence, it served as part of an international railway line and as a transit road through Novi Sad.
During the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the bridge was bombed 12 times. On 23 April 1999, it was finally destroyed, cutting railway transport between Belgrade and Subotica, i.e. Serbia and Hungary. During the NATO bombing, all three large bridges on Danube river in Novi Sad (Žeželj Bridge, Varadin Bridge and Liberty Bridge) were completely destroyed.
In 2000, a temporary Road–Railway Bridge was constructed near the Žeželj Bridge to serve as a replacement of Žeželj Bridge until the new one was constructed. Over the years, the construction of the new Žeželj Bridge was postponed several times.
In April 2012, the construction works for the new bridge in the same place officially started. The main designer of the new bridge was Aleksandar Bojović, while the contractor was an international consortium, JV Azvi - Taddei – Horta Coslada. The new bridge is visually similar to the destroyed bridge, except that the arches are made from steel and not prestressed concrete. The bridge consists of two arches, the larger one being long and high and the smaller one long and high.
In October 2017, the arches of Žeželj Bridge were connected after five years of construction and eighteen years after the previous bridge was destroyed. As of October 2017, the construction works cost was 51.71 million euros. In April 2018, the bridge was completed and regular rail transport established. The vehicle transit was established on 1 September 2018.

WWE Hall of Fame (2018)

WWE Hall of Fame (2018) was the event that featured the introduction of the 19th class to the WWE Hall of Fame. The event was produced by WWE on April 6, 2018 from the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans, Louisiana. The event took place the same weekend as WrestleMania 34. The event aired live on the WWE Network, and was hosted by Jerry Lawler. The following night, a condensed one-hour version of the ceremony aired on USA Network.
Background.
On January 15, 2018, ESPN announced that Goldberg would be inducted as the headliner of the WWE Hall of Fame. Goldberg, after a successful run with World Championship Wrestling, signed a one-year contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in March 2003, debuting on the March 31 episode of "Raw". Goldberg would go on to face Lesnar at WrestleMania XX, however fans knew this would be the final WWE match for both Goldberg and Lesnar, and thus gave largely negative reactions throughout the performance. During the episode of "WWE 24" featuring Goldberg, he admitted that he did not have the right attitude while in the WWE, which caused him to leave on bad terms. After a twelve-year absence, Goldberg appeared on the October 3, 2016 episode of SportsCenter, where he contemplated a return to WWE, which eventually occurred on an episode of "Raw", two weeks later. Goldberg's return would include a run with the WWE Universal Championship, and ended after his match with Lesnar at WrestleMania 33. Goldberg appeared the following night on "Raw Talk" (which aired on the WWE Network after the "Raw" broadcast) to wish the fans farewell, but ultimately did not rule out a return in the future.
On February 19, 2018, WWE announced that Jeff Jarrett would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 6, an announcement that was met with "widespread surprise" due to the circumstances of Jarrett's departure from the promotion in 1999 and his role in founding Impact Wrestling. Jarrett left the WWF in October 1999, right after WWF head writer Vince Russo resigned from the WWF in order to join WCW. Jarrett's contract expired on October 16, 1999, one day before his scheduled match with Chyna at No Mercy. Jarrett wrestled at No Mercy nonetheless, losing the Intercontinental Championship to Chyna. Chyna later alleged that Jarrett and Russo had colluded in order to delay Jarrett's title defense until after Jarrett's contract had expired, and that Jarrett had subsequently made a deal with WWF Chairman Vince McMahon for $300,000 in order to wrestle without a contract. In 2006, Jarrett asserted that he had been paid only what he was owed by the WWF. In a 2008 interview for a TNA special, Jarrett stated that not only were his negotiations cordial and in good faith, but that he also got stock options in WWF's IPO, which occurred two days after he left.
Event.
Due to the launch of the WWE Network shortly before WrestleMania XXX, this event featured the fifth "Red Carpet" event as a one-hour pre-show prior to the start of the event. The pre-show was hosted by Byron Saxton, and Maria Menounos. Renee Young and Charly Caruso conducted interviews from the red carpet.
The event itself had kicked off with an image stating it was in memory of Johnny Valiant, who died two days earlier. Valiant was struck at 5:30a.m. and killed by a pickup truck in Ross Township. He was taken to Allegheny General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
The first inductees were The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley), who were inducted by Edge and Christian. Edge and Christian discussed why they were chosen to induct The Dudley Boyz, and how their team and The Hardy Boyz would not exist without the Dudleys. During the Dudleys speech, Bubba Ray told D-Von he is only supposed to say "testify", to which D-Von responded that he is now a producer and Bubba Ray needs to step back. They both thanked their families, including a reference to Mr. T's long speech at the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony. They continued by saying they are the first Extreme Championship Wrestling act to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, and thanked their fellow ECW wrestlers. They invited Edge, Christian and The Hardy Boyz on stage with them, as Bubba Ray said it was thanks to the six of them together that they are where they are today. Their music then played signalling it was time to wrap up, and they finished by putting the producer through a table.
Lawler next introduced Hillbilly Jim by stating he was already in the Denim Overalls Hall of Fame and the Moonshine Hall of Fame. Jimmy Hart came out to induct Jim, stating they have been friends for 39 years, and he never would have worked for the WWE if it were not for him. Jim talked about the story of how he got involved in wrestling, and thanked Jim Ross, Dale Mann, Archie Gouldie, Stu Hart, Jerry Lawler, Jerry Jarrett and Pat Patterson for giving him the opportunities they did. Jim went on to say he was accepting this honor on behalf of his mother, family and most of all the fans. Jim finished by talking about his friends Johnny Valiant, André the Giant, Lord Alfred Hayes, Gorilla Monsoon, Bobby Heenan, Freddie Blassie, Lou Albano, Jimmy Snuka, Randy Savage, and Roddy Piper; who all meant so much to him but are no longer around to see his induction.
In 2016, WWE introduced a new category for the Hall of Fame called the "Legacy" wing. Inductees under this new category feature wrestlers from the early years of professional wrestling, primarily during the early part of the 20th century. All inductees in 2018 were inducted posthumously and were recognized with a video package at the ceremony. A video montage was run next for the legacy inductees, which were Stan Stasiak, El Santo, Jim Londos, Sputnik Monroe, Boris Malenko, Dara Singh, Hiro Matsuda, Rufus R. Jones, Cora Combs, and lastly Lord Alfred Hayes.
Ivory was the next inductee, inducted by Molly Holly. Holly discussed all that Ivory has done in the ring and out, and called out Lilian Garcia to introduce Ivory. Ivory spoke about her road stories and how the women's movement has progressed over the years. Ivory compared being inducted to getting married as you only do it once (while poking fun at Ric Flair), and went on to say she has never been married, so she is treating this as her wedding. While describing how it would relate to her wedding, Ivory was cut off by the Right to Censor music when her descriptions got too sexual. Ivory finished by thanking her family and the fans.
Kid Rock was next inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, Celebrity Wing, by Triple H. Triple H talked about how Kid Rock was the voice of the attitude era, and all he provided to the WWE over the years. Kid Rock started by saying Vince McMahon does not like getting thanked, so he wanted to send a big thank you to McMahon for all he did. Rock spoke briefly about his involvement in the WWE and finished by talking about his former bandmate Joe C.
Lawler said the next inductee Jeff Jarrett, means a lot to him, as he helped train him during their times in Memphis. Road Dogg came out to induct Jarrett, and discussed their times on the road. Jarrett discussed his career and times in groups such as The Four Horsemen and the New World Order. Jarrett said there are two people who have meant a lot to him that he had to thank, and emotionally thanked both Road Dogg and Owen Hart. After telling some stories on the road, Jarrett thanked Karen Jarrett, his kids, his father Jerry Jarrett, and his grandmother Christine. Jarrett ended by reciting a poem which he had recited during his first wrestling appearance. Following Jarrett's speech, Road Dogg came out and the two sang their song "With My Baby Tonight".
Following The Ultimate Warrior's death in April 2014, WWE introduced the Warrior Award, in 2015, for those who have "exhibited unwavering strength and perseverance, and who lives life with the courage and compassion that embodies the indomitable spirit of the Ultimate Warrior." The 2018 inductee was Jarrius "JJ" Robertson, a double liver transplant survivor.
Mark Henry was next inducted by Big Show. Henry discussed his family and what made him come into wrestling. Henry then transitioned into his Sexual Chocolate persona, talking to Stephanie McMahon before turning to his wife, and thanked Mae Young and Chyna for helping make the character. Henry went on to talk about the great times he had with the Nation of Domination, and talked about his relationship with each of the members. He then went on to plead with Martha Hart, the widow of Owen Hart, to please allow Owen to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Henry then changed his jacket to the jacket he wore during his previous false retirement, and challenged AJ Styles and Roman Reigns, before removing the jacket and thanking everyone.
Paul Heyman came out to induct Goldberg, and after announcing him cameras followed Goldberg to the stage from the locker room, similar to his entrances on "Monday Nitro", while the people in attendance chanted his name. Goldberg stated that much like his matches his speech will be short. Goldberg started by stating he was the first WCW and WWE Champion to be Jewish and to have a bar-mitzvah. Goldberg went on to thank those who helped train him and made him look good in the ring, as well as his family, and for their support during his return to the ring. Goldberg finished by thanking the fans, sharing a Stephanie McMahon story, and discussing the respect he had for Sting and Diamond Dallas Page.

WWE Hall of Fame (2013)

WWE Hall of Fame (2013) was the event which featured the introduction of the 14th class to the WWE Hall of Fame. The event was produced by WWE on April 6, 2013 from Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. The event took place the same weekend as WrestleMania 29. The event was hosted by Jerry Lawler. A condensed one-hour version of the ceremony aired on the USA Network the following Tuesday. In March 2015 the ceremony was added to the WWE Network.
Background.
After leaving the WWF (now WWE), Sammartino became an outspoken critic of the path on which Vince McMahon has taken professional wrestling. He particularly criticised the use of steroids and "vulgar" storylines. In 2013, Sammartino accepted an invitation for induction into the Hall of Fame, after having declined several times in prior years. He finally accepted the offer to join because he was satisfied with the way the company had addressed his concerns about the direction of the business. In April 2018, Sean Waltman announced on his podcast, that should Sammartino not have accepted the invitation to be inducted, D-Generation X would have been inducted.
Event.
Mick Foley was inducted by his long time friend Terry Funk. The two discussed all their times on the road together which included time at WWE, World Championship Wrestling and Extreme Championship Wrestling. Foley also said that he had regrets from his career. The main one was that he never beat Chris Jericho. Jericho then ran up on the stage, laid down, and told Foley to pin him. Foley originally acted like he couldn't and was walking away when he ran back and dropped an elbow on Jericho. He then pinned Jericho and CM Punk counted the one-two-three, jokingly giving Foley his first victory over Jericho.
Bob Backlund was inducted by Maria Menounos.
Trish Stratus was inducted by Stephanie McMahon. During Stratus' speech she announced that she was expecting her first child, a son, later in 2013.
Vince McMahon inducted Donald Trump. Vince spoke of Trump and their working relationship during WrestleMania IV and WrestleMania V, as well as the "Battle of the Billionaires" at WrestleMania 23.
Booker T was inducted by his brother Stevie Ray, whom he had teamed together with for many years as Harlem Heat. Booker T later admitted during an interview with John Layfield, on his show "Legends with JBL" on the WWE Network, that prior to him asking Stevie Ray to induct him, that the brothers had not spoken in nearly 5 years.
The final inductee of the evening was Bruno Sammartino who was inducted by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Although Sammartino saw great success in New York City during his career, this event marked Sammartino's return to the WWE after 25 years. It was just the second time in Hall of Fame history that Vince McMahon would be seen on camera, after 2009 when he inducted Stone Cold Steve Austin.
Aftermath.
Sammartino appeared on the October 7, 2013, episode of "Raw" and received a birthday greeting in his hometown of Pittsburgh. On March 28, 2015, Sammartino inducted Larry Zbyszko into the Hall of Fame class of 2015.

The current Old Goat is Admiral Bill Lescher, who received the award from Admiral Kurt W. Tidd, former Commander, U.S. Southern Command. Tidd was also the Navy's "Old Salt" - the active-duty Navy officer with the longest-standing surface warfare qualification. The prior holder, ADM Harry B. Harris Jr., passed on the title to ADM Tidd in a presentation ceremony, 11 April 2018, citing his intent to retire in June.

<doc id="57016639" url="?curid=57016639" title="Boycott of The Ingraham Angle">
Boycott of The Ingraham Angle

The boycott of "The Ingraham Angle" is an ongoing boycott of companies that advertise their products during the Fox News television show "The Ingraham Angle". Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student David Hogg initiated this boycott after the show's host, Laura Ingraham, ridiculed him amidst conspiracy theories related to the shooting at his school in 2018, in which seventeen students died and where Hogg was a witness and survivor. Ingraham's particular criticism of Hogg was that some universities declined to offer him admission after his college application.
Hogg accused Ingraham of cyberbullying and suggested his followers tell her show's sponsors to cancel their advertising purchases. In response, several advertisers left the show after which Ingraham apologized. Hogg dismissed the apology as insincere, and he and his supporters continued the pressure campaign on her show's advertisers.
More than 20 sponsors have stopped advertising on the show. Public polling showed that public perception of Fox News declined more than that of any advertiser. Advertising rates for the show declined slightly, and the amount of advertising during the show was reduced by as much as half.
The boycott resulted in mixed reactions. Supporters of Ingraham's position included her employer Fox News, musician Ted Nugent, and Russian web brigades. Bill Maher defended Ingraham on grounds of free speech, saying that the boycott was wrong. Back on the air after a week on a "pre-planned vacation", Ingraham described the boycott as "Stalinist" and blamed leftists for working against free speech. Hogg intensified the boycott in following months, further raising pressure on the show. In 2020 S&amp;P Global attributed a decline in Fox News advertising revenue to the boycott.
Background.
On February 14, 2018, David Hogg survived the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in which a mass shooter killed seventeen people and wounded seventeen more. A few days after the shooting, Hogg and other shooting survivors founded Never Again MSD, a student group advocating for safety in school. On March 24, Never Again MSD was a lead organizer of March for Our Lives, a global student-led demonstration with some demands to change gun law in the United States. More than a million protestors attended more than 800 events around the world.
David Hogg reported to his own social media which colleges had offered or declined admission to him. On March 27, 2018, TMZ published an article listing all these schools. The following day "Fox News" personality Laura Ingraham ridiculed Hogg, tweeting: "David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it. (Dinged by UCLA with a 4.1 GPA...totally predictable given acceptance rates.)" Hogg responded with a tweet that listed her advertisers, and suggested those advertisers be boycotted.
Impact.
Within two days, fifteen companies had ceased advertising on Ingraham's show, including AT&amp;T, Office Depot and TripAdvisor. Other companies such as Ace Hardware dropped the show in the ensuing days. A few days later, Allstate stopped advertising on Ingraham's show, circulating a memo to employees citing the company's values being at odds with Ingraham's comments.
Ingraham publicly apologized for her remark within 25 and a half hours of her initial criticism, but Hogg rejected it as insincere, saying she had only apologized because advertisers had left her show, and that he would accept an apology in the future if she denounced the way her network treated him and his friends. Republican strategist Steve Schmidt speculated why Ingraham's advertisers pulled their support: "...this kid's not scared. He's not scared of the NRA. He's not intimidated and scared by Laura Ingraham."
Ingraham returned to her show in April after a pre-planned week-long Easter break, with the support of Rupert Murdoch. According to "The Washington Post", the advertising time dropped by half following the spat, but there was speculation that it might "blow over" with some advertisers returning to the show after the interest died down. "Fox News" co-president Jack Abernethy said that the network "cannot and will not allow voices to be censored by agenda-driven intimidation efforts".
A total of 24 sponsors had stopped advertising on "The Ingraham Angle" by mid-April 2018 
Polling by YouGov BrandIndex in the days following the announcement of the boycott showed that the Fox News brand had sustained significantly more consumer perception damage than any of the advertisers. The positive consumer perception of Ingraham dropped from 53 percent to 33 percent, according to the celebrity data and research firm Spotted. Rates for advertising during the show dropped after the start of the boycott. Prices for a 30-second spot dropped from an average range of $12,310-$14,732 to an average range of $11,305-$13,405, according to analysts. Advertising time during the show dropped by as much as 52 percent.
A 2020 review by S&amp;P Global remarked that Ingraham's views continued to be a deterrent to advertisers and contribute to the decline in advertising revenue of parent Fox News. Forbes also reflected on the boycott in 2020.
List of advertisers in boycott.
Following Ingraham's comments about Hogg, the following sponsors made announcements that they would no longer advertise on "The Ingraham Angle".
Reactions.
At the end of her Friday, March 30 show, Ingraham announced she was taking a week-long absence from the show for Easter. This week-long break was already planned in advance prior to the controversy and advertiser loss, according to Ingraham and Fox News.
My Pillow creator Mike Lindell became a target of the boycott, refusing to join the other advertisers in pulling out of "The Ingraham Angle".
Fox News, Ingraham's media organization, responded to the boycott stating, "We cannot and will not allow voices to be censored by agenda-driven intimidation efforts".
According to Hamilton 68, hundreds of Russian bots came to Ingraham's defense on Twitter during the weekend following the boycott. Posts under the hashtag #IStandWithLaura jumped 2800 percent and was the top trending hashtag for Russian Twitter accounts.
Talk show host Bill Maher came to the defense of Ingraham, saying that the boycott was wrong, and that her show should be continued on the grounds of advocating free speech, and saying that he, himself, had been the victim of a boycott, and he felt that he had been unfairly treated in the past.

St. Louis Cardinals.
Arozarena signed with St. Louis Cardinals as an international free agent in July 2016 for $1.25 million. He made his minor league debut in 2017 and spent his first full professional season with both the Palm Beach Cardinals, with whom he was named a Florida State League All-Star, and the Springfield Cardinals, posting a combined .266 batting average with 11 home runs, 49 RBIs and 18 stolen bases over 121 games between both clubs.

That season the Mayos made it to the championship series. Although the team did not win the series, Arozarena had a game winning hit in the bottom of the ninth inning in game 6. Arozarena was a non-roster invitee to 2018 spring training. He began the season with the Memphis Redbirds. In July 2018, he was selected to represent the Cardinals in the 2018 All-Star Futures Game. Arozarena also spent time during the season with Springfield. With Memphis, he helped them win the Pacific Coast League title, and was named a co-MVP of the PCL playoffs alongside teammate Tommy Edman. Over 113 games between Memphis and Springfield, he batted .274/.359/.433 with 12 home runs, 49 RBIs, and 26 stolen bases.

Arozarena began the 2019 season on the injured list with Memphis due to a fractured hand suffered during spring training. He returned to play in May with Springfield before being promoted back to Memphis in June.
On August 12, 2019, the Cardinals selected Arozarena's contract and promoted him to the major leagues. He made his major league debut on August 14 versus the Kansas City Royals. Over 19 games with St. Louis, Arozarena hit .300 with one home run, two RBIs, and two stolen bases.
Tampa Bay Rays.
On January 9, 2020, Arozarena was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays (along with José Martínez and the Cardinals’ Competitive Balance Round A Draft Pick) in exchange for Matthew Liberatore, Edgardo Rodriguez, and the Rays’ Competitive Balance Round B Draft Pick. Over 23 games for the 2020 season, Arozarena batted .281 with seven home runs and 11 RBIs.
In Game 7 of the American League Championship Series against the Houston Astros, Arozarena hit a two-run home run, surpassing Evan Longoria for most home runs by a rookie in the postseason. Arozarena was named the MVP of the ALCS, becoming the first rookie position player to win the award. In the series, he hit .321 with four home runs and six RBIs. In the World Series, Arozarena hit home runs in the third, fourth, and sixth games, breaking the all-time record for most home runs in a single postseason. In Game 3, he surpassed Derek Jeter for most hits by a rookie in the postseason. In Game 5, he recorded his 27th hit in the postseason, surpassing Pablo Sandoval for the most hits in a single postseason. 
Personal life.

He has stated that he would like to become a Mexican citizen and represent Mexico in the World Baseball Classic.
On November 23, 2020, Arozarena was arrested in Mexico’s Yucatan state after allegedly trying to kidnap his two year old daughter from her mother and assaulted the woman’s father. He was released two days later as the mother of the child did not press charges.
A film based on Arozarena's life is currently scheduled to be released between 2022 and 2023.

Linear drumming

Linear drumming is a drum kit playing style in which no drum, cymbal, or other drum component hits simultaneously. Unlike other forms of time keeping and fills, there is no layering of parts. For example, if playing a cymbal, no other drum set voice, such as a snare or bass drum, would be hit at the same time. Various cymbal ostinatos and other stickings can be used, but are not required. Linear drumming does not refer to any specific function of playing; rather, it applies to grooves, rhythms, and embellishments designed to create musical phrases. The drum kit voices can be combined in any order. One common fill application uses the combination of double stroke rudiments and single stroke rudiments between the hands and feet in a succession of sixteenth notes or triplets.
Linear drum beats have appeared in various formats, ranging from shuffle feels, 4/4 feels, double-time feels, half-time feels, swing, and odd time meters. The playing style has steadily gained popularity amongst professional artists worldwide. It has been applied by drummers such as Jeff Porcaro (“Rosanna”), David Garibaldi (“What is Hip”, “Down to the Nightclub”, “Soul Vaccination”, and “Oakland Stroke”), and Steve Gadd (“Fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover”). Steve Gadd has been associated with a signature drum lick that uses linear playing methods to create a thirty-second note half-time feel. Electronic and hip hop artists have also applied the linear time keeping concept using drum machines (ex. Mac Miller’s “I’m Not Real”).

Kung Fu Elliot

Kung Fu Elliot is a 2014 Canadian film co-directed by Matthew Bauckman and Jaret Belliveau, reportedly a documentary, concerning the attempt of Elliot "White Lighting" Scott to become "Canada's first action star".
Synopsis.
The film, billed as a documentary, follows the misadventures of Elliot "White Lighting" Scott, a man from Halifax, to make his third martial arts film, "Bloodfight", between 2011 and 2013. Scott, an alleged Japanese-Canadian who has allegedly won numerous martial arts championships, has in partnership with his long-suffering girlfriend Linda Lum produced, directed and scripted two previous "micro-budget" martial arts films starring himself, "They Killed My Cat" (2009) and "The Hero and the Stalker" (2010). Despite the low budget of his films and his inability to act, Scott is convinced he will become a great film star. Scott at one point says: "I’m being a superhero for everyone who can’t be a superhero in the movies". Scott talks constantly about his legions of "fans" that he supposedly has in both Canada and China, but which are never seen in the film.
One reviewer, Anthony Harrison, wrote about Scott's film-making attempts: "However, Scott makes Ed Wood seem as capable a filmmaker as Orson Welles or Alfred Hitchcock. He doesn’t make B-movies; even calling Scott’s films Z-movies compliments them. There exists no letter beyond Z to accurately describe how bad Scott’s movies are. They’re shot on digital cameras and feature wooden actors delivering inane dialogue alongside horribly executed effects and fight scenes...No matter how bad the movies are, they’re driven by a nearly childlike sincerity. Scott has ambitious ideas, but he’s crippled by a lack of money — and talent." Over the course of the film, Scott's relationship with Lum disintegrates owing to his childish, immature character; his unwillingness to propose marriage to Lum, which she clearly wants; and his preference for spending his time using her money to make his martial arts films instead of getting a job. Finally Lum persuades Scott to take a job with a local traditional Chinese medicine clinic, where he studies acupuncture.
Scott, a man with an Asian fetish, especially for Asian women, goes to China, ostensibly to study acupuncture and shoot film footage for "Bloodfight" at the Shaolin Monastery. In China, Scott makes advances upon nearly every woman he meets, says he will soon be making a film with Jackie Chan, claims to have 900 fans on a Facebook group in Beijing (Facebook is not allowed in China), inspires amusement from a Shaolin monk over his inability to perform kung fu properly, and is unable to buy Lum the jade engagement ring she wants. Scott's acupuncture teacher, Dr. Diana Li, complains about his behavior in China: "You just trying to meeting all the girls". Scott explains his Asian fetish as due to his supposed Japanese descent, claiming to be one-sixth Japanese.
Towards the end of the film, Scott is revealed to be a pathological liar and a manipulative man whose life-story is shown to be a fraud. Scott abandons "Bloodfight", instead making pornographic films starring himself and various prostitutes. In the last scene, Lum breaks up with Scott concerning a woman he brought to her house the previous night, and he then assaults the cameraman. The film's epilogue states that Scott has never won any martial arts championships and he has disappeared from Halifax.
One of the filmmakers behind "Kung Fu Elliot", Jaret Belliveau stated: "(Elliot’s) movie is a mind-boggling experience, and the fact that it exists, as a feature, just amazed us. It supposedly won these five awards at the Vancouver 8mm Martial Arts Film Festival, so we were perplexed by him right from the get-go. We confirmed on the Internet that the film fest where he won didn’t actually exist, but we thought it just added to the mystique of Elliot and the answers he gave to our questions. We thought it was all very innocent; he was still making "Blood Fight", and he had this great cast of people around him and a supportive partner, and we didn’t know how far she was in on these little white lies." Belliveau stated that filming Scott was a frustrating experience as he was constantly lying to them about his supposed exploits and he stated his suspicion that the supposed stalker who was threatening Lum was in fact Scott, who was merely applying the plot of his film "The Hero and the Stalker" to real life in a bizarre bid to save a relationship that was falling apart.
Reviews.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 6.79/10. Reviewing the film in "The New York Times", the critic Daniel Gold wrote: ""Kung Fu Elliot" chronicles his [Scott's] amateurish efforts to make a third feature, "Bloodfight" which he expects will be his breakthrough. Watching Elliot and his fellows stumble determinedly through shoots, pleasantly delusional about the movie’s prospects, is mildly amusing, a testament to indie film’s appeal for a certain hardy strain of dreamer...Upon his return home [from China], reality and fantasy increasingly collide, and Elliot’s distorted perspective slips into outright lies to friends and documentarians alike. By the abrupt and bizarre end of this odd little film, the question is whether Elliot’s just a low-grade scam artist or afflicted with a personality disorder. Or both". Reviewing the film in "The Toronto Star", the critic Peter Howell wrote: "What begins as an amusing "Project Grizzly"-style account about a Canuck dreamer, one who jokes about making "acceptable cheese" with his movies, gradually becomes something different and darker as we learn one thing after another that mutes the laughter." However, Howell expressed some doubts about the last half of the film, wondering if Belliveau and Bauckman were manipulating Elliot on his self-destructive course. The critic Whitney Mallett wrote the film explored well the delusions of Scott from went from an eccentric underdog to a darkly manipulative type.
The critic Sarah Kurchak wrote that Elliot's manipulative behavior was repulsive and the film inspires "schadenfreude" at his ineptitude and sympathy for Lum. Kurchak also expressed some sympathy for the actor Blake Zwicker, writing his inept "unhinged" reading "To be or Not to be" soliloquy from "Hamlet" was "inhumane", but his pain over the death of his late girlfriend showed a more sympathetic side to the man." The critic Stephen Faber called the film the story of "likable, indefatigable losers"."
The critic Ben Sachs wrote in "The Chicago Reader": "This Canadian documentary begins like an addition to the cycle, following Elliot Scott, a 30-ish amateur filmmaker, as he embarks on his latest no-budget actioner. Scott believes he can become the next Chuck Norris, and he's indulged by his idiot friends and long-suffering girlfriend (a levelheaded preschool teacher who should know better). As his production derails, however, the tone grows dark and revelations about Scott render him thoroughly unsympathetic. Directors Matthew Bauckman and Jaret Belliveau withhold key information until the third act, forcing one to reevaluate everything that came before, but by then you may already have grown tired of the cheap laughs." The critic Robert Horton wrote: ""Kung Fu Elliot" invites audience mirth at the expense of its collection of Nova Scotia oddballs, but you might not feel so guilty about your laughter by the time the movie reaches its bizarre, late-hatching revelations. There’s some creepy stuff going on in Halifax, folks...Elliot’s feeble martial-arts demonstration in front of an actual Shaolin monk is one of the movie’s indicators that Elliot’s bravado might not be founded in reality. In short, Elliot starts looking less like a self-deluded dreamer and more like a sociopath. Directors Matthew Bauckman and Jaret Belliveau play the audience quite skillfully here, as the story gradually goes down a disturbing road. It’s like watching the career of Ed Wood unfold in time-lapse quickness: from gung-ho promoter to ham-handed moviemaker to sleazy purveyor of soft-core (and possibly hard-core) porn. It’s a strange game for a documentary to play, and it leaves behind a faintly sour taste; you feel especially bad for the people sucked into Elliot’s high-kicking vortex. (One "Blood Fight" actor, hung out to dry by Elliot and the doc filmmakers alike, seems to have sprung from the "Waiting for Guffman" ensemble cast.) I’m mostly sure "Kung Fu Elliot" is for real; if not, somebody went to a lot of trouble to create the trailers for Elliot Scott’s past DVD efforts, such as "They Killed My Cat".
In a review, the critic Chris Klimek wrote that "Kung Fu Elliot" was entertaining, but that: "Kung Fu Elliot"’s violent climax arrives so swiftly, it raises the question of whether everything preceding it has been a hoax." In a review, the critic Casey Tourangeau questioned if the "Kung Fu Elliot" was really a documentary, stating the film felt "staged". Likewise, the critic Michael Rechtshafen wrote in "The LA Times":"Well before that point arrives, when the affably goofy portrait takes a decidedly darker turn, one begins to suspect that directors Matthew Bauckman and Jaret Belliveau, just like their subject, might have been playing fast and loose with the truth. As presented, even the sweetly delusional Scott, with his heavy Canadian accent and doughy face, would have made for such a terrific "SCTV" character that it's hard to completely accept that he's the real deal". In a review, Kevin Jagernauth wrote about the efforts of Bauckman and Belliveau that the film was involving, but at the last act seemed implausible, leading him to suspect the film was staged.
The critic Etlan Adler wrote the film's: "...lively portrait of Elliot Scott, a Canadian martial-arts enthusiast with the dream of becoming his country’s first major action-movie star, always feels a little too good to be true. It’s not just the way that Scott’s delusions of grandeur make him resemble an extra from a Christopher Guest mockumentary; the entire production plays like a sly riff on the hit 1999 documentary "American Movie", where director Chris Smith chronicled the low-budget filmmaking exploits of a modern-day Ed Wood, Mark Borchardt...And some cursory Googling brings up both an official Facebook page and Twitter feed for Scott—although the latter notably hasn’t been updated since 2012—as well as his production company’s website, Bad Acting Good Kung Fu Canada, which includes links to local press stories about him...But that doesn’t entirely erase lingering doubts that this whole thing might be an elaborate put-on, doubts that arise from the way the story unfolds and the behavior exhibited by both Scott and some of the supporting players in his life, including producer/girlfriend Linda Lum and buddy/co-star Blake Zwicker, who could be the Canadian cousin of "American Movie" sidekick Mike Schank...The fact that "Kung Fu Elliot" ultimately follows the same "fall from grace" arc that's present in so many fictional "star is born" narratives is another subtle indication that things aren’t necessarily what they appear to be. The movie ends with Scott conveniently fleeing Canada for parts unknown (possibly China) and neither he nor Lum appear to have stepped forward since to confirm or deny the movie's account of the final years of their professional and personal relationship."
The critic David Shreve argued that the film was not an "outright lie", but "there’s also no reason to believe that directors Matthew Bauckman and Jaret Belliveau didn’t have access to the big tone-shifting revelation until roughly the last week of "Kung Fu Elliot" in their two year filming stretch, which is what the film’s form and construction would have you believe. That information was knowingly back-pocketed until the right moment. Have whatever debate you would like regarding whether omission qualifies as deceit, but this sort of withholding certainly doesn’t constitute an act of honesty in the language of documentary film." About the debate over the veracity of the film, critic Rob Hunter wrote: "There are moments in the third act that might test the trust of viewers suspecting a staged interaction or line reading, but by all accounts what we see is real. It’s easy to question as Scott and his cohorts are at times too ridiculously bad at what they do, but their sincerity is on equal display."

Yevdokiya Rachkevich

Yevdokiya Yakovlevna Rachkevich (; née Andriychuk; 22 December 1907 – 7 January 1975) was the deputy regimental commander and commissar of the 46th Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment (a.k.a., the "Night Witches") during the Second World War, known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War. After the end of the war, Rachkevich traced the regiment's path throughout the war and managed to locate the remains of women in the regiment that were listed as missing in action so that they could receive a proper burial. Soldiers that went missing in action were considered potential traitors until their remains were found because they could have been captured, and Soviet prisoners of war were considered "guilty until proven innocent" of collaboration with the Axis, especially after Order No. 270 forbid surrender or retreat. 
Early life and prewar career.
Rachkevich was born on 22 December 1907 in what was then the village of Nadnestrryanskoye in the Russian Empire, now located within present-day Ukraine. In 1919 she graduated from a parish school in her hometown. In 1922 she worked as a janitor for the Kamyanets-Podilsky border guard where she worked until she became a member of the Communist party in 1926 and was transferred to work as a district organizer in Kamenets-Podilski. In 1928 she graduated from a one-year law school in Kiev before working as a judge for two years, after which she began working as an assistant to the regional prosecutor in Zhytomyr. In 1931 she married Pavel Rachkevich, who was the commissar 3rd Cavalry Regiment of the 1st Krasnokazchie Division. In 1932 she enlisted in the Red Army and was assigned to work as a political instructor in the 1st Krasnozakachy Division. In 1934 she entered the Lenin Military-Political Academy; in 1937 she became the first woman to graduate from the academy, after which she taught at the Leningrad School of Military Communications.
World War II.
After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 Rachkevich was the commissar of a military field hospital from July 16 to September 28. After taking accelerated navigator's courses at Engels military aviation school she was deployed in February 1942 as the commissar of the 588th Night Bomber Regiment, which received the Guards designation in 1943 and was reorganized to the 46th Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment of the 325th Night Bomber Aviation Division within the 4th Air Army on the 2nd Belorussian Front. She later became the deputy regiment commander of the political department of the regiment. During the war she occasionally accompanied bombing sorties, flying as a navigator on 36 missions in addition to equipping the Po-2s for flights. After the war she was demobilized from the military with the rank of major until she was recalled to the military in 1951.
Later life.
After re-entering the military in 1951 Rachkevich served as a political instructor for a unit of Soviet troops in East Germany until she retired in 1956 with the rank of Lieutenant colonel. After retirement from the military she lived in Moscow where she involved herself in public work; she later managed to locate the remains of all members of the 46th Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment shot down in the war, marking the crash sites as memorials. She passed away on 7 January 1975 and was buried in the Khovansky cemetery.

Victor Lomonosov

Victor Lomonosov (7 February 1946 – 29 March 2018) was a Russian-American mathematician known for his work in functional analysis. In operator theory, he is best known for his work in 1973 on the invariant subspace problem, which was described by Walter Rudin in his classical book on Functional Analysis as "Lomonosov's spectacular invariant subspace theorem". The Theorem Lomonosov gives a very short proof, using the Schauder fixed point theorem, that if the bounded linear operator "T" on a Banach space commutes with a non-zero compact operator then "T" has a non-trivial invariant subspace. Lomonosov has also published on the Bishop–Phelps theorem and Burnside's Theorem 
Lomonosov received his master's degree from Moscow State University in 1969 and his Ph.D. from National University of Kharkiv in 1974 (adviser Vladimir Matsaev). He was appointed at the rank of Associate Professor at Kent State University in fall 1991, becoming Professor at the same university in 1999.

1940 United States presidential election in Arkansas

The 1940 United States presidential election in Arkansas took place on November 5, 1940, as part of the 1940 United States presidential election. State voters chose nine representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Background.
Except for the Unionist Ozark counties of Newton and Searcy where Republicans controlled local government, Arkansas since the end of Reconstruction had been a classic one-party Democratic “Solid South” state. Disfranchisement of effectively all Negroes and most poor whites by a poll tax since 1890 meant that outside those two aberrant counties, the Republican Party was completely moribund and Democratic primaries the only competitive elections.
Increased voting by poor Ozark whites as a protest against Woodrow Wilson's internationalist foreign policy meant that Warren G. Harding in 1920 was able to win almost forty percent of the statewide vote; and 1928 saw the rest of the Outer South and North Alabama bolt the anti-Prohibition Catholic Al Smith. However, the presence of Arkansas Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson as running mate meant that within Arkansas only the most northwesterly counties with ordinarily substantial Republican votes suffered the same fate.
The following years saw Arkansas plunge into the Great Depression, followed almost immediately by a major drought from the summer of 1930s until the winter of 1931/1932. Arkansas gave extremely heavy support to Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. Roosevelt won every county in the state, and was extremely popular in the “Solid South” throughout his first term. although his popularity lessened somewhat during his second term due to the urban and labor bias of the New Deal, Roosevelt remained in no danger in 1940. This was especially true given that the South had never experienced German or Scandinavian immigration and thus strongly sympathized – as FDR did – with Britain in World War II. Thus FDR was able to almost maintain his 1936 majority in the Natural State, and replicated the county map of 1896, 1916, 1924 and 1936.

Speaker of the Parliament of Ghana

The Speaker of the Parliament of Ghana is the presiding officer of the Parliament of Ghana. The current speaker is Alban Kingsford Sumana Bagbin. He was elected on 7 January 2021.
History.
The first speaker of the Parliament of Ghana was Sir Emmanuel Charles Quist who was Speaker of the National Assembly from independence on 6 March 1957 until December 1957. Prior to Ghana's independence, the Governor of Ghana presided over the legislative council. This changed in 1949 when Emmanuel Quist became its first African president. The Legislative Council elected Quist as its first speaker in 1951. The longest serving speaker was Daniel Francis Annan who served from 7 January 1993 to 6 January 2001. In January 2009, Joyce Adeline Bamford-Addo became the first lady to be speaker of the Ghanaian parliament.
Appointment and office tenure.
Article 95 of the 1992 Ghana constitution provides for the election of a speaker from among the members of parliament or from persons who are qualified to be members of parliament. Where the speaker is elected from among the members of parliament, Article 97 of the constitution specifies that the Speaker vacates his or her seat in Parliament, triggering a by-election. The only person to have been in this position so far is Edward Adjaho who was the elected member for the then Akatsi South constituency.
Deputy Speaker.
There are two Deputy Speakers who are elected from among the members of parliament by the members. Both deputy speakers cannot be from the same political party. The current Deputy Speakers are the MP for Bekwai, Joseph Osei-Owusu, of the New Patriotic Party and MP for Fomena, Andrew Asiamah Amoako, an Independent MP.
Role.
Article 101 of the Ghana Constitution stipulates that the Speaker presides at all sittings of parliament. Where the speaker is not able to do so, one of the two deputies presides. No parliamentary business can take place without the speaker in the chair.
The speaker also takes precedence over all people in Ghana except the President of Ghana and the Vice President. In view of this, the speaker may act on behalf of the president if neither the president nor the vice president is able to do so. The constitution stipulates that there should be an election within three months of the speaker assuming the presidency due to the death or removal of the president and vice president. The Speaker does not have a vote in parliament. This means that when the votes are tied, the motion is lost. The Speaker is also the chairman of the parliamentary Service Board. The Speaker also appoints four additional members to this board. The sixth member of the board is the Clerk of Parliament.

Delta Beta Tau

Delta Beta Tau (), is an American co-ed Buddhist college fraternity founded at San Diego State University (SDSU). The fraternity was founded on September 9, 2015 by ten SDSU students as the first Buddhist college fraternity in the United States. Although the fraternity was founded on Buddhist principles, the fraternity accepts people of any religious background and also accepts members who are already members of other college fraternities. The fraternity is run almost entirely on voluntary donations and has a membership due for pledges of just one dollar per semester.
As of August 20, 2019 the fraternity has initiated 223 active members at its founding chapter at SDSU.
History.
The fraternity was founded and organized by Dharma Bum Temple, an American Buddhist temple near SDSU for which the fraternity based the letters of its name off of. The co-founder of the temple, Jeffrey Zlotnik, was in Beta Theta Pi in college and suggested creating a Buddhist fraternity as a way to find a way to instill college students with Buddhist principles that would follow them throughout college and for the rest of their lives. Dharma Bum Temple chose SDSU to build the first chapter of the fraternity because it already had a strong presence on the campus from running an SDSU meditation club called "The Aztec Dharma Bums".
There was originally plans to create one Buddhist fraternity and one Buddhist sorority, but it was eventually decided to create one co-ed fraternity.
In 2017, the fraternity announced plans to start another chapter at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) as well.
Principles.
The co-ed fraternity takes the Six Paramitas of Mahayana Buddhism as the founding principles of the fraternity. The rules for the fraternity are based on Buddhist principles and to join pledges do community service and attend meditation retreats. Activities the fraternity offers include meditation retreats, guest speakers and community service events, with social gatherings incorporating mindfulness into them.
As of January 2018, there are no official Greek houses for Delta Beta Tau members to live together in, instead meetings are held at locations near the campuses until Greek housing for the fraternity can be established. Once Greek housing is set up, the fraternity plans on having house rules based on Buddhist principles and for the fraternity to hold normal Greek events such as formals and dating dashes, but with Buddhist values and mindfulness elements incorporated.
Service.
Delta Beta Tau's service programs are largely entwined with the outreach programs of Dharma Bum Temple, the temple that helped organize the founding of the fraternity. The fraternity focuses on community service, taking the principles of Buddhism as the basis for its values. Fraternity members are trained in guiding meditation so they can teach meditation to the community as a form of community service. Other outreach programs the fraternity hosts include volunteer work at local animal shelters, as well as participating in the existing prison outreach and homeless feeding programs that are hosted by Dharma Bum Temple.

<doc id="57017056" url="?curid=57017056" title="2018 Oklahoma teachers' strike">
2018 Oklahoma teachers' strike

The 2018 Oklahoma teachers' strike began on April 2, 2018, with teachers across the state walking out to protest low pay, overcrowded classrooms, and tax cuts that resulted in lower state-wide education spending. It was the first such action in Oklahoma since 1990. The OEA declared an end to the strike on April 12 after an agreement to increase salaries and state funding for education was reached. The call to end the strike faced some objection from teachers and parents who do not believe that enough concessions were made by lawmakers.
Unlike the similar action in West Virginia, the strike was not a "wildcat" strike, as it received endorsement from union leadership, albeit only after pressure from teachers. The protest occurred concurrent with similar protests in Arizona, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Colorado.
Background.
State of public education in Oklahoma.
Since 2008, education spending per student in Oklahoma has fallen 28%. Due to the decrease in funding, twenty percent of schools run on four-day weeks, and many have eliminated art and language classes and shut down sports programs. Gains from last teachers' strike in Oklahoma, in 1990, which resulted in an agreement to lower class sizes, expand kindergarten programs, and increase teacher wages were later reversed due to budget cuts. The decline in funding and subsequent decline in the quality of public education has resulted in the expansion of charter schools in the state.
Plans for a Walkout.
In 2016, State Question 779 was placed on the ballot, but failed to gain enough votes. SQ 779 propsed a one cent increase in sales tax and was estimated to bring in $615 million for education funding (including educator pay raises) in its first year. Failure of SQ 779 left many educators frustrated. Support for a strike began to build in early March of 2018, after another proposal (dubbed the "Step Up" plan) failed to pass the required 75% threshold for tax increases. The "Step Up" plan would have increased certain taxes and boosted teacher pay by $5,000. Both Democrats and Republicans voted for and against the bill. Some Democrats who voted "no" believed the plan did not go far enough to restore funding.
Plans for a strike beginning on April 2 were first floated in March. On April 2, schools throughout Oklahoma were scheduled to take standardized tests; preventing these tests from taking place could potentially jeopardize millions in federal funds allocated to Oklahoma. After the Oklahoma legislature passed a tax increase to fund teach pay raises with the required 75% in each body on Friday, March 30, a strike beginning on the 2nd was announced. Thus, even before the walkout, teachers won greater school funding and salary increases, funded in part by increases in the cigarette tax, motor fuel tax, and the gross production tax on petroleum.
Walkout.
The strike lasted from April 2nd to April 12th. Strike leaders had called for the introduction of a capital gains tax to avoid a regressive tax, but the terms were nevertheless accepted. The legislature passed no further tax increases after the walkout began.
Salary demands.
Public school teacher salaries in Oklahoma prior to the strike were the third lowest in the United States (after South Dakota and Mississippi), resulting in some teachers and staffers working second or third jobs.
An initial offer of a $6,000 wage increase, ratified by the governor, was rejected, as the initial demands were for a $10,000 raise for teachers and a $1250 raise for support staff.
Reactions from state officials.
Governor Mary Fallin likened teacher demands to "...teenager(s) wanting a better car". The quote was appropriated by teachers and used in chants during protests at the Oklahoma State Capitol. 
State representative Kevin McDugle, a Republican, indicated he would not pass any bill or measure to increase education spending due to the protests undertaken by the teachers.
Results.
A survey in 2019 found that the pay raise obtained by the strike had lifted the State's teacher pay ranking to 34th in the nation, higher than the surrounding states of New Mexico, Kansas, Missouri and Arkansas, but still lower than Colorado or Texas. 
Ten Republican representatives who were opposed to raising taxes to increase teacher salaries were up for re-election in 2018. Two, Scott McEachin and Chuck Strohm, were eliminated by other Republican nominees during the initial primary, while a further seven did not gain enough votes to win their primaries uncontested. These seven faced runoff elections in August 2018, and six lost.

Arena Electoral

Arena Electoral was an online platform created by Fundación Ethos during the Mexican electoral process of 2012 to promote responsible voting. The project did this by simulating an online competition in which all four presidential candidates: Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Enrique Peña Nieto, Josefina Vázquez Mota, and Gabriel Quadri, were given certain topics based on the Mexican national agenda and had to come up with a solution. After the candidates published their policies, the platform unanimously published them on their website and Mexican citizens were in charge of voting for what they believed was the best policy. Presumably, the goal of the platform was to allow Mexican citizens to vote for the policymaker that shared the same ideas as them instead of voting for a candidate based on party affiliations or other types of bias.
Background.
The software was developed and designed by a much larger organization known as Fundación Ethos and supported by the United Nations Population Fund and by National Endowment for Democracy (NED) of the United States. Fundación Ethos is an international group of economists, lawyers, communicators, web designers, and political scientists, all who have experience in government and policymaking. However, with its headquarters located in Mexico City, the organization mainly works to achieve its goals first in Mexico and Latin America.
Software.
Arena Electoral 2.0 as it is currently known was developed and produced under Fundación Ethos. The project was both an online platform and cellular application, with its online form still accessible.
Funding.
The platform was created by a non-profit, independent and non-partisan organization that is financed by contributions from individuals and international organizations, with short contributions. Arena Electoral states that they do not provide any product in exchange for their services, do not give or sell pantries, hats, shirts or pictures for your car. They do not sell or give anything away, although they have considered selling t-shirts with their logo printed on them, for now, nothing is sold on their site.
Principles.
On its webpage, Arena Electoral lists nine main principles in which they presumably aimed to follow and keep in order to have remained as neutral as possible. Their first principle and notice are that they were not in the business of giving out/selling items, pantries, hats, shirts or pictures for your car. Their second principle is in regards to advertising. Arena Electoral state that they did advertise on their site, but according to them it was only used as a necessity to pay for their "discrete" salaries. However, according to them they did not accept (nor will we ever accept) money or resources from candidates or companies that intentioned to modify Arena Electoral's opinions, analyzes, or evaluations based on their donations. Furthermore, in their third principle Arena Electoral address and talk about their allies. They claim that fortunately, there were many organizations allied to the platform. There were some partners who they previously had collaborated with and others who they state they only sympathized with. Arena Electoral say that they even got to know partners as well as a result of the platform, which accordingly allowed them to inform and spread their proposals. At the end of the section Arena Electoral make a disclaimer saying that the information that their partners decided to share in their platform was generated independently without the intervention of their own team or any of the other organizations that participated in the project, and as a result claimed that everyone was free and responsible to propose anything on the site. Furthermore, Arena Electoral's fourth principle titled "APPARATUS" claims that they were 100% nonpartisan and independent of any candidate or party. They claim that no member of their team was allowed to participate directly in the campaign of any of the candidates they evaluated on the platform. Their fifth principles are in regards to conduct. Arena Electoral clearly state that they did not accept gifts from any of the candidates or their people. Their sixth principle addresses media. They acknowledge that some of their members appeared on television to give opinions, but that they were independent of the project since they were only spokespersons of Arena Electoral when they presented themselves as such. Nonetheless, their following principle is titled "CONFLICT OF INTERESTS." In this section, they state that any member of the Arena Electoral team who had a husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend, partner or a close relationship with a candidate, or member of their team, was known on their personal information. In the following section (eighth principle), Arena Electoral address the opinions that were shared or published on the site. They presumably claim that any opinions or editorialized material that was on the platform were made explicit. That is, they claim that any opinion that appeared on the platform was the sole opinion of that person and should not have been considered a formal opinion supported by Arena Electoral as a whole or its associates in particular. The ninth and final principle that Arena Electoral aimed to implement on their platform was the use of the page. In this final section the platform claim that users of the page were invited to make good use of it. Arena Electoral state that any forums that were disrespectful, aggressive, insulting and used words that did not dignify the debate and democratic deliberation was eliminated. In other words, Arena Electoral claim that they did not permit any type of harassment of unethical behavior on the platform.
Mission.
The main goal of Arena Electoral was to promote responsible voting. They aimed to achieve this by making citizens aware on which candidate was the most fitting policy maker in accordance with their own ideas.
Safe-space for Citizens to communicate to each other.
Arena Electoral also aimed to be a platform for citizens to express and publish their own opinions without having to worry about party or candidate affiliations. In other words, the platform was also aimed to be a safe-space for citizens according to Arena Electoral.
Promote responsible voting.
In order to promote responsible voting, Arena electoral created a tool within their platform called Votomático. Votomático was a questionnaire containing 25 questions, all based on five major themes: security and justice; economic development; social development and the environment; human rights and State Reform, and Foreign Policy. The results were anonymous unless you chose to share them on social media. The questionnaire in Votomático was multiple choice and each question had five different answers. From those five answers, you picked the one that most likely matched your way of thinking. After answering every question, according to Arena Electoral, the exercise would show which candidate you have the most affinity with. With Votomático Arena Electoral aimed to show citizens with which of the four presidential candidates they were more inclined to. However, according to Fundación Ethos, the tool was not created to induce suffrage in favor of a specific candidate and/or political party. Instead, presumably Votomático was developed so citizens could know the proposals of the candidates and from that identify with whom they shared similar ideas.
How it works.
The way Arena Electoral functioned was that the four presidential candidates received questions based on eleven topics regarding the national agenda. The topics were:
After giving their proposals on the topic, the candidates were then evaluated by more than 200 experts including academics from both public and private universities. The evaluators according to Arena Electoral, scored the candidates based on their responsibility, viability, feasibility, all while withholding the platform's principles and aspirations.
Results.
The final result showed Andrés Manuel López Obrador as the winner with 5.7. Enrique Peña Nieto, the incumbent, came in second with 5.2. Consequently, Josefina Vázquez Mota came in third with 4.4 and with the lowest score came in Gabriel Quadric with 2.8.
Legacy.
Currently, Arena Electoral is still up and running and now serves as an informative site that still, according to them, aims to explain to citizens the power of voting and its importance, all while guiding in what is needed to express this right in Mexico or abroad. Nonetheless, the site still contains all previous articles, editorials, related texts and past proposals of the previous candidates.

April 2018 caste protests in India

In early April 2018, lakhs of people belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC/ST) protested across India against an order of the Supreme Court on the Atrocities Act. In subsequent violence, ten people died and hundreds were injured.
Background.
The Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 protects the SC/ST caste groups. The act does not allow the court to grant anticipatory bail to accused person. The police must file a First Information Report (FIR) and arrest the accused on receiving a complaint. In 2016, the conviction rate under the act was 25.7% in cases of atrocities against SC and 20.8% in cases against ST in 2016, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. On 20 March 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that no arrests can be made without prior permission and allowed a court to grant an anticipatory bail if it, prima facie, finds the complaint an abuse of the law. The Attorney General of India, on behalf of the Government of India, filed a review petition against the order of the Supreme Court.
Protests.
The people from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC/ST) protested against the Supreme Court order. Thousands of people took to the streets on 2 April 2018, when a national strike was announced by representatives of the SC/ST caste groups in protest of the decision. The protests turned violent across several states in India as the protestors blocked trains, damaged property, and clashed with police and other civilians. There were also incidents involving arson, vandalism and gunfire. At least fourteen people were killed: nine in Madhya Pradesh, Three in Uttar Pradesh, two in Rajasthan; hundreds of others were injured. Violent incidents were also reported in the states Punjab, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Gujarat, Haryana, Maharashtra and Delhi.
Suspected non-Dalit groups, who were angered by the rampage, targeted Dalit slums in retaliation and burnt the house of Bharosi Lal Jatav, a former Indian National Congress (INC) legislator, and ransacked the home of Rajkumari Jatav, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Hindaun, Rajasthan. A curfew was imposed in Hindaun following the violence, and later extended.
Twenty four government vehicles and sixty private vehicles were damaged in Haryana. 84 police officials and eight civilians were injured during the violence on 2 April in Haryana. Nine policemen were injured in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.
Response.
Thousands of protesters were arrested and curfew was imposed in several places. 1700 anti-riot police were sent to states by the Government of India. Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) (which prohibits assembly of more than four people) was imposed in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. Police had filed reports against 5,000 unidentified and 285 named miscreants, while 32 agitators were arrested under various sections of the Indian Penal Code in Ghaziabad. At least fifteen FIRs were registered by the police in Ludhiana, Punjab against hundreds of unidentified protesters for alleged road blockades and for causing obstructions. The Haryana Police booked around 4,000 persons and 100 others were arrested for indulging in violence while as many as 47 FIRs were lodged. The internet services were suspended in Punjab and Rajasthan.
Aftermath.
The Supreme Court held hearing on the review petition on 3 April 2018 but did not stay the order and have called to hear the matter in ten days.

Prisoner Human Rights Movement

The Prisoner Human Rights Movement was launched in 2011 by Pelican Bay State Prison inmates in response to large numbers of inmates being moved from general prison populations to solitary-confinement units after allegations of gang affiliation or political organizing. Its goal is to improve living conditions for inmates in California.
Purpose.
The Prisoner Human Rights Movement wanted to address inadequacies in the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, including:
To deal with these issues, the Pelican Bay organizers called for the right to document, expose and challenge abuses and violations; an end to violence and brutality by prison employees; an end to police brutality, inside and outside prison, and the right to safety from retaliation and coercion, threats and blackmail to betray fellow prisoners with false accusations.
Background.
Pelican Bay State Prison, California’s only supermax prison, was built in 1989 on the outskirts of Crescent City. Half the prison houses maximum-security inmates in the general population, and the other half holds prisoners in Security Housing Units. Cells in the latter are windowless, concrete boxes. Inmates are confined to the cells for twenty-two to twenty-three hours a day without access to telephones, television, programs, loved ones and basic human interaction. They receive three meals a day through a small slot at the bottom of their cell door. Inmates housed in the Security Housing Units are subjected to abuse from other inmates and guards.
Inmates are sent to the Security Housing Units at the discretion of correctional administrators. They are sent for a fixed term for breaking a prison rule, or for an indeterminate term for being labeled a prison-gang member. The largest segments of Security Housing Units populations are jailhouse lawyers and political activists. Although inmates identified as gang members are not supposed to be isolated for more than six years, the prison-gang investigation unit often finds new evidence to extend an inmate’s isolation. The only way for these prisoners to leave the Security Housing Units is to debrief. An inmate debriefs by divulging information incriminating other inmates as gang associates. Although inmates (or their families) who debrief can become targets of violence by gangs, they often provide false information about others to escape the Security Housing Units. Assignments in the Security Housing Units can also affect sentencing length and severity. Inmates do not earn credit for time served in the Security Housing Units, extending their sentence and making them eligible for release later than they would otherwise be. Inmates sentenced to life imprisonment are not eligible for parole while they are in the Security Housing Units. For many inmates, the only options for escape are debriefing or death. This essentially removes sentencing from the judiciary and gives it to prison administrators.
In 2007, inmates in the Pelican Bay Security Housing Units spent an average of over two years in isolation before being released into the general population or paroled; some have spent decades in solitary confinement. Every month, about 15 prisoners are paroled from the Security Housing Units with no services to assist with the transition from isolation to freedom.
Movement.
In response to the treatment of prisoners housed in Pelican Bay's Security Housing Units, four inmates (Arturo Castellanos, Sitawa Nantambu Jamaa (Ronnie Dewberry), Todd Ashker, and George Franco) began the Prisoner Human Rights Movement. As the movement's principal negotiators, they have organized around the belief that the Department of Corrections is fraught with systemic, deep-rooted problems. The movement's goal is immediate action by the governor of California to remedy the Department of Correction's policies and enforcement and to encourage lawmakers to create effective and genuine improvements to the department.
In addition to the principal negotiators, the Prisoner Human Rights Movement is composed of twenty representatives, local councils, and the plaintiffs in " Ashker v. Brown". The principal negotiators, the movement's face and driving force, represent over 100,000 inmates in thirty-three California prisons. Representatives and local councils monitor and record conditions at their prisons, reporting to the principal negotiators. On April 3, 2011, the Pelican Bay negotiators issued five core demands.
Hunger strikes.
2011.
On July 1, 2011, a hunger strike began. Nearly every prisoner in the Pelican Bay Security Housing Units (over 1,000 inmates) was refusing food, and they were joined by general-population inmates. By the end of the first day, about 6,000 prisoners across California had reportedly participated in the hunger strike. Though levels of participation varied (from inmates partaking only in food purchased from canteens, to liquid sustenance, to refusal of any and all sustenance) the most involved organizers made it clear that they were willing to starve to death to have their demands met. In the first week, supporters on the outside were also engaging with the movement by fasting and participating in solidarity demonstrations across the state. Within the next few weeks, prison and state officials scrambled to deal with the strike. Some prisons used deceptive tactics, like lying about meeting the demands of the strike, or spreading rumors that an inmate had died, attempting to break solidarity between prisoners. Other prisons further isolated prisoners participating in the hunger strike, cutting off communications between the prisoners and the outside world. As the strike wore on, state officials threatened to force feed inmates who were refusing food, though this action is illegal in most cases. Three weeks into the hunger strike, the CDCR agreed to enter negotiations with the Pelican Bay PNs and immediately conceded on a few points. The strike officially ended on July 20. However, most conditions within the prison remained largely unchanged.
The hunger strike resumed on September 26, with about 12,000 people in California and other states participating in the strike. It was called off on October 15, 2011.
2013.
The 59-day 2013 California prisoner hunger strike, organized by the Pelican Bay PNs (who became known as the Short Corridor Collective), mobilized 30,000 prisoners across the state. The strike ended when a judge issued a court order allowing the strikers to be force-fed by the state.
Legal remedies.
"Ashker v. Governor of California" (or "Ashker v. Brown") was a class action lawsuit filed on May 31, 2012 by the Pelican Bay Hunger Strike negotiators on behalf of inmates housed in Security Housing Units. The case was an amended version of an earlier "pro se" lawsuit filed by Pelican Bay Security Housing Units inmates Todd Ashker and Danny Troxell. Judge Claudia Ann Wilken of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California presided over the case. It was settled in September 2015, ending indiscriminate solitary confinement in California.
After the settlement, nearly 1,500 prisoners were transferred from Security Housing Units to the general population. Many inmates were sent to Level VI housing, however, which mimicked solitary confinement. In March 2018, a federal court refused to order the Department of Corrections to release long-term Security Housing Units inmates into the general population. The defense counsel noted that the earlier settlement was inadequate for ending indeterminate isolated imprisonment in California.
International law.
In August 2011, the United Nations General Assembly published a Human Rights Council report on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The report outlines the international consensus that solitary confinement in pretrial detention for more than fifteen days of juveniles or people with mental disabilities is "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and even torture". It describes best practices for states to limit solitary confinement. The report was crucial as a legal defense to the movement's claim that prolonged solitary confinement is a form of torture and a human-rights violation under international law.

In 2017, JTC1/SC29/WG1 (JPEG) issued a Call for proposals for JPEG XL the next generation image coding standard.
The file format (bitstream) was frozen on December 25, 2020, meaning that the format is now guaranteed to be decodable by future releases.
Features.
The main features are:
Technical details.
JPEG XL is based on ideas from Google's PIK format and Cloudinary's FUIF format (which was in turn based on FLIF).
The format has a variety of encoding modes. On the legacy side, it has a mode that transcodes legacy JPEG in a more compact way for storage. On the more modern side, it has a lossy mode called VarDCT (variable-blocksize DCT) and a lossless/near-lossless/responsive mode called Modular which optionally uses a modified Haar transform (called "squeeze") and which is also used to encode the DC (1:8 scale) image in VarDCT mode as well as various auxiliary images such as adaptive quantization fields or additional channels like alpha. Both modes can use separate modeling of specific image features: splines, repeating "patches" like text or dots, and noise synthesis. Lossy modes typically use the XYB color space derived from LMS.
Prediction is run using a pixel-by-pixel decorrelator without side information, including a parametrized self-correcting weighted ensemble of predictors. Context modeling includes specialized static models and powerful meta-adaptive models that take local error into account, with a signaled tree structure and predictor selection per context. Entropy coding is LZ77-enabled and can use both asymmetric numeral systems (ANS) and Huffman coding (for low complexity encoders or for reducing overhead of short streams).
It defaults to a visually near-lossless setting that still provides good compression.
Animated (multi-frame) images do not perform advanced inter-frame prediction, though some rudimentary inter-frame coding tools are available:

Howard W. Penney

Lieutenant General Howard W. Penney (December 5, 1918 – June 25, 2004) of United States army, was first director of Defense Mapping Agency from July 1972 to August 1974. Under Penney’s leadership, the new agency focused its assets into a decentralized structure with a lean staff to respond to the rising demands for geographic information by a variety of military users.
Early life, and education.
Lieutenant General Penney attended the University of Detroit, and graduated with a BS from the United States Military Academy in 1940. He earned an MS in civil engineering at Texas A&amp;M University in June 1949. He completed the United States Army Command and General Staff College in June 1952, and the National War College in June 1959.
Defense Mapping Agency.
In response to President Nixon’s directive of July 1971, Lieutenant General Penney consolidated the Department of Defense's military mapping, charting and geodesy (MC&amp;G) activities and created DMA. Under his leadership from July 1972 to August 1974, the new agency focused these assets into a decentralized structure with a very lean staff to respond to the high demands for geographic information by military users.
Awards, and decorations.
In 2001 Lt. Gen. Penney was inducted into the inaugural class of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Hall of Fame, where he is credited for "helping the military overcome doubts as to whether or not DMA could meet their needs." His military decorations and awards include:

Kiugak Ashoona

Kiugak Ashoona (1933–2014; Inuktitut syllabics ᑭᐅᒐᒃ ᐊᓲᓇ) was a Canadian Inuk artist renowned for his sculptural work and his expansive artistic portfolio. He experienced the longest career of any Cape Dorset artist, and is a member of the Order of Canada and the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. In 1999, he was awarded the Canada Council Molson Prize for his outstanding lifetime contribution to the cultural and intellectual life of Canada.
Early life.
Kiugak was born to Inuit artist Pitseolak and her husband, Ashoona, in the community of Tariugajak on Baffin Island, Northwest Territories (now Nunavut), on September 16, 1933. He was one of the last generations to be born on the land and raised with the traditional lifestyle of the Inuit people. In 1945, after the death of his father, Kiugak's mother relocated her family to the community of Cape Dorset, over away, to be closer to relatives. Pitseolak and her children were introduced to the carving trade in Cape Dorset. In 1947, Kiugak's first carving made from walrus tusk was traded to the Baffin Trading Company by his brother, Qaquq, for some large biscuits. As art grew as a new economic opportunity and hunting declined, Kiugak, like many Inuit people, transitioned from hunting to creating and selling carvings. His work focused primarily on scenes of Inuit life, such as hunting scenes, mothers and children, as well as creatures of myth or fantasy.
Artistic career.
In 1951, Kiugak was introduced to James Houston, an artist from southern Canada who was sent to Cape Dorset to collect Inuit carvings for the Canadian Arts and Craft's Guild. Houston and Kiugak worked together to expand carving in the community.
Sometime in the 1950s, Kiugak married Punisti in Igali, a community east of Cape Dorset. He lived with her father Kiakshuk, a renowned "angakkuq" (shaman) and artist. During this time Kiugak became aware of the shamanic culture and history and incorporated these themes into his later work. After Punisti's death, Kiugak married graphic artist Sorosiluto in 1960, and had multiple children, both natural and adopted. His eldest child is contemporary Inuk artist Shuvinai Ashoona (born 1961).
Kiugak Ashoona is a self-taught artist. During his childhood, he would often create drawings using pencil with little influence from others in his life. During the 1940s, Kiugak began creating sculptures out of ivory. After meeting with Houston, Kiugak transitioned to stone sculpture as this was widely popular in southern art markets. Many of his sculptures at this time were of more naturalistic human figures with themes of hunting and other traditional Inuit activities. In the early 1960s, he took a great interest in conveying Inuit mythology and shamanism through his sculpture.
While Kiugak is most famous for his carvings, he experimented in other mediums such as drawing, painting, and printmaking. He first began printmaking in 1962, using stone-cut engraving. From 1977 to 1981, Kiugak took an interest in acrylic painting, basing his style off Kingmeata Etidlooie, one of the first artists in Cape Dorset to take up this medium. In 1980, Kiugak created drawings using graphite and a combination of coloured pencil and felt-tip pen. During this time, he experimented with creating photorealistic drawings, but ultimately stopped because it was difficult to transfer such detailed drawings into stone carvings.
Prior to his death in 2014, Kiugak had the longest artistic career of any artist living in Cape Dorset. Along with his many awards and honours, his sculpture "Sedna" was featured on a Canadian postal stamp in 1980 as part of a series celebrating Inuit culture. Kiugak's work has been featured in over 75 exhibits both within Canada and internationally.
His work is held in several museums, including the Museum of Modern Art, the McCord Museum, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Canada, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, Kleinburg, Ontario and the British Museum.
Awards and honours.
Kiugak received multiple honours including:

Trams in Rockhampton

Rockhampton Council Tramways was a steam tram service which was operated by Rockhampton City Council from 1909 until 1939 in the city of Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia. Rockhampton was the only regional city in the state of Queensland to have had a tram service. The line has since been rebuilt and is operated as a tourist attraction by the Archer Park Rail Museum.
Early tramway proposals.
The idea of a tramway service in Rockhampton had long been discussed prior to the official opening of the city's tramway in 1909. As early as 1881, the idea had been discussed.
In 1883, the idea of a horse-drawn tramway was proposed to link the north side of Rockhampton with the south, from Charles Street to the railway station in Stanley Street via Rockhampton City. In September 1883, the Rockhampton and Northside Tramway Company Ltd was formed.
A construction order was granted to the company in June 1884, and trackwork commenced in Yaamba Road (now Musgrave Street) near Charles Street in August 1884. The work was ultimately abandoned in 1885 and the rails that had been laid were eventually buried.
Further proposals for a Rockhampton tramway were put forward in 1897, 1900 and 1901 which included a proposal for an electric tramway system.
Rockhampton Municipal Council endorsed a proposal in 1903 to construct a tramway system using steam cars burning coke. But this proposal also stalled.
Following a council tramway committee being established in 1906, Queensland's chief railway engineer Henry Charles Stanley was commissioned by the Rockhampton Council in 1907 to investigate the feasibility of a steam tramway system in Rockhampton.
Despite debates on whether an electric system would be preferable to a steam tramway, it was recommended the self-propelled steam cars with small enclosed steam engine be used, namely the French Purrey steam cars designed by acclaimed Bordeaux manufacturer and civil engineer Valentin Purrey.
Having previously observed the Purrey steam cars in Paris, Stanley gave assurances the Purrey steam cars were clean, neat and comfortable compared to the Sydney Steam Motor Trams which ran in Sydney which Stanley described as "highly objectionable, noisy, dirty and dangerous".
Original 1909–1939 service.
The service was officially opened by Queensland Premier (and Member for Rockhampton) William Kidston on the morning of 5 June 1909 with the inaugural tram service departing from a decorative arch at the intersection of Bolsover and William Street in Rockhampton City and making its way to the Rockhampton Botanic Gardens on The Range.
On its first day of operation, 7,600 passengers were transported by the new tramway service.
The trams ran around a belt line of William, East, Archer and Canning Street with routes extending out to the Rockhampton Showgrounds in Wandal, the South Rockhampton Cemetery in Allenstown and up to the Rockhampton Botanic Gardens on The Range. The gauge of the track was 1067mm (3 ft 6in).
Throughout the three decades in which the trams ran, the service struggled to be financially viable particularly when it faced competition from a new bus service in the 1920s.
In 1937, Rockhampton City Council made a unanimous decision to replace the tramway system with new diesel buses.
Rockhampton Council Tramways' final service was at 11 pm on 24 June 1939.
During its existence, the tramway service carried over 40 million passengers and travelled over 4.5 million miles while collecting over £350,000 in fares.
Following the closure of the Rockhampton tramway, the council decided to bitumen over the tram tracks, burying them due to the cost involved in removing them.
Accidents.
During the thirty years of operation, the trams in Rockhampton became notorious for accidents resulting in casualties – the first of which occurred just two days after the official opening in 1909 when a track worker was struck and killed by a tram.
The most notorious incident occurred on 28 September 1913 when three people were killed when a tram car capsized on a sharp bend at the corner of Ward Street and Dagmar Street after departing the Rockhampton Botanic Gardens following an afternoon performance by the Lakes Creek Brass Band. It was reported that the same tram had left the rails and crashed into a fence at the same location on an earlier occasion.
Another serious incident occurred on 8 January 1919 when a tram collided with a train at the intersection of Denison Street and Archer Street where the tram tracks intersected with the main railway line in Denison Street. Although 15 passengers were injured, there were no fatalities.
However, there were further fatal accidents involving the steam trams in 1928, 1929 and 1933.
1988 reconstruction.
Interest was sparked in Rockhampton's Purrey steam trams in the early 1970s following articles published in the "Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin" and "Trolley Wire". The 18–35-year-old group of the Rockhampton branch of the National Trust of Australia began searching for parts of the original steam trams to reconstruct a new Purrey steam tram at the old Canning Street tram depot, in time for the Australian Bicentenary celebrations in 1988.
From 1982, Rockhampton City Council coordinated the restoration project, using grants made available to the Bicentennial Scheme and officially launched the project in June 1984 at a ball to mark 75 years of council-operated public transport in Rockhampton.
Although various parts of the original trams were successfully relocated including the collapsed body of one of the old trams, other parts were sourced from elsewhere including the steam engine unit from the Antique Machinery Society in Brisbane, and a Purrey boiler steam feedwater pump from the Ipswich railway workshops.
Two public open days were held during the steam tram's reconstruction which attracted large crowds. Following some setbacks, the tram was successfully completed on 10 May 1988 at a cost of $212,000.
On 5 June 1988, Rockhampton mayor Jim Webber officially declared the steam tram restoration complete, exactly 79 years since William Kidston had declared the city's first tram service open on 5 June 1909.
Following the official ceremony, the tram commenced one-way trips along the Denison Street railway line between Stanley Street and Fitzroy Street for a cost of $1 per trip. The tram carried 2,600 passengers between 9:30 am and 4:30 pm.
Tourist attraction.
During the official ceremony at the 1988 event, the general manager of local newspaper "The Morning Bulletin" Mike McCarthy presented a $20,000 cheque to Mayor Jim Webber to put towards constructing and establishing a permanent tourist tram route in Rockhampton.
"Trolley Wire" reported at the time that there were two schools of thought on how the newly built Purrey steam tram could be used as a local tourist attraction. One proposal was for the tram to run along the old railway wharf branch line down Stanley Street and then run along Quay Street parallel to the Fitzroy River past the heritage-listed buildings in the CBD. The second proposal involved the tram running from the tourist information centre in Lower Dawson Road, then skirt the Yeppen Yeppen Lagoon before terminating at the Rockhampton Botanic Gardens. It was reported the Yeppen Yeppen Lagoon proposal was the one Rockhampton City Council favoured the most.
However, the Purrey steam tram ultimately found its new home at the old Archer Park Railway Station which was handed over to Rockhampton City Council by Queensland Rail in 1990, for the purpose of transforming it into a museum.
The reconstructed tram is still housed at the Archer Park Rail Museum and operates as a tourist attraction for several hours each Sunday on 1.1 kilometres of isolated tram track between Albert Street and Fitzroy Street which runs parallel to the main line on Denison Street.
The restored tram is believed to be the last operational Purrey Steam Tram in the world.

Flag of Long Beach, California

The flag of Long Beach, California was adopted on July 5, 1967. It incorporates the city's seal, name, and motto on a gold, white, and blue field. The field is designed to be reminiscent of a beach. Each of the colors also have their own meaning, the gold represents the sand on the beach, the white represents the city's clean air, and the blue represents the Pacific Ocean.
History.
Former flag (1948–1967).
In 1948, Corporal Eugenia McGrath of the Long Beach Lancerettes, a semi-military mounted troop of female lancers, designed the first city flag of Long Beach. A physical form of the flag was made by Captain Arvery Lehman and was flown by the Lancerettes in city parades.
Current flag (1967–present).
By 1956, the city of Long Beach had begun to consider adopting a new flag. The city assigned three city officials, Fielding C. Combs, the director of public relations, Edwin Castagna, the city librarian, and Jerome Donson, the municipal art director, with making the new flag and called for it to have the city seal on it. Later on, per the request of the public relations committee, the city council invited organizations to submit flag designs as well. By 1958, the need to adopt a new city flag had become a more urgent issue. The three officials originally tasked with designing the new flag later came to the conclusion that the seal was too complicated to be on a flag and Combs suggested that citizens should send in proposals. The city held several flag design contests in the early 1960s but none of the proposals were accepted. One person later suggested that the city flag should be based on the flag of the Port of Long Beach, which was designed in 1964 by Al Maddy, the port's Director of Administration. A city flag derived from Maddy's design ended up being adopted by the city council on July 5, 1967.
Vietnam War.
During the Vietnam War in late 1967, shortly after the city of Long Beach had adopted its current flag, Lance Corporal Steven Radford, a resident of Long Beach, received a copy of the "Press-Telegram" from his parents, Ernest and Hazel. After reading in the paper that the city had recently adopted a new flag, he decided that he wanted one to remind him of his hometown and sent a letter to the Long Beach City College's Volksen Club requesting one. The club responded to his request by presenting a flag to his parents to send to him. By the time Radford was sent the flag, he was recovering from an injury aboard the USS Sanctuary.
On Christmas Day of 1968, the flag of Long Beach was added to the USS New Jersey, a Long Beach-based battleship which was deployed in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam War. It was placed on the quarterdeck of the ship alongside the flag of the United States and the flag of New Jersey.
Boy Scouts of America.
For the 1969 National Scout Jamboree in Farragut State Park, Idaho, the Long Beach branch of the Boy Scouts of America brought a city flag to accompany them.
Rose Parade.
For the 1973 Rose Parade, the Long Beach Mounted Police, serving as the parade's color guard, carried the city flag as well as the mounted police banner and 26 American flags.
2004 North American Vexillological Association survey.
In 2004, the North American Vexillological Association held a survey where it ranked 150 American city flags based on the quality of their designs. The flag of Long Beach placed 90th, receiving a score of 3.70 out of 10.

The Queers discography

The discography of the Queers, an American punk rock band, consists of 13 studio albums, 9 live albums, 4 compilation albums, 1 video album, 3 music videos, 22 EPs, 1 single, and 1 split album.
After forming in 1981, the Queers released two EPs in the early 1980s, "Love Me" (1982) and "Kicked Out of the Webelos" (1984), both on band leader Joe Queer's Doheny Records imprint. Their first album, "Grow Up", was released in 1990 through British independent record label Shakin' Street Records. The band then signed to Lookout! Records, who reissued "Grow Up" and released the subsequent studio albums "Love Songs for the Retarded" (1993), "Beat Off" (1994), "Move Back Home" (1995), and "Don't Back Down" (1996), as well as the compilation albums "A Day Late and a Dollar Short" (1996) and "Later Days and Better Lays" (1999). The Queers also released a cover version of the Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" album in 1994 through Selfless Records, as well as two live albums and a number of EPs through other labels during these years.
The band then moved to Hopeless Records, releasing the studio albums "Punk Rock Confidential" (1998) and "Beyond the Valley..." (2000) and the live album "Live in West Hollywood" (2001). They returned to Lookout! for the "Today" EP (2001) and album "Pleasant Screams" (2002), but soon parted ways with the label again. A split album with Italian band the Manges, titled "Acid Beaters", was released in 2003 through Stardumb Records, followed by 2004's stopgap album "Summer Hits No. 1" on Suburban Home Records, consisting of new recordings of songs from the Queers' back catalog.
In 2006 the Queers followed several other former Lookout! artists in rescinding their master tapes and licensing rights from the label. They signed to Asian Man Records, who released their eleventh studio album, "Munki Brain" (2007), and also reissued all of their Lookout! albums (excepting "Later Days and Better Lays"), having all of them remastered (and all but "A Day Late and a Dollar Short" and "Pleasant Screams" remixed) by the band's longtime collaborator Mass Giorgini. Licensing rights to several of these reissues subsequently passed to Dayton, Ohio-based Rad Girlfriend Records. A twelfth studio album, "Back to the Basement", followed on Asian Man in 2010. The Queers also released 8 split EPs with various other bands between 2004 and 2018. Most recently, the Queers re-recorded both of their Hopeless albums, issuing "Beyond the Valley Revisited: Live at Loud &amp; Clear Studios" in 2016 through Asian Man and "Punk Rock Confidential Revisited" in 2018 through Asian Man, Rad Girlfriend, and the band's own new imprint, All Star Records.
Other appearances.
The following Queers songs were released on compilation albums. This is not an exhaustive list; songs that originally appeared on the band's albums, EPs, or singles are not included.

They only have to sit at the back and support the elders or their husbands or the leaders in their families . . . All they have to do is just support them in terms of looking for money, looking for food, and looking after the babies and the families".

Let's Stay Together is an album by American jazz organist Jimmy McGriff featuring performances recorded in 1966 and 1972 and released on the Groove Merchant label.
Reception.
Allmusic's Stephen Cook said: ""Let's Stay Together" is a great set by one of the masters of the Hammond B-3 organ sound". On All About Jazz Douglas Payne noted "The music, unfortunately, isn't terribly memorable. But the R&amp;B covers benefit by McGriff's outstanding blues touch and the funky "Tiki" and the glorious blues of "Old Grand Dad" (the only originals) are what make a McGriff album worth every dollar.

Jennings v. Rodriguez

Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. ___ (2018), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that detained immigrants do not have a statutory right to periodic bond hearings.
The case was brought about by Mexican citizen and lawful U.S. permanent resident Alex Rodriguez. After a 2004 incident, he was detained on the grounds of 8 U.S.C. 1226, which states that under a warrant by the Attorney General immigrants may be arrested and detained while their case status is decided. Rodriguez challenged this justification in 2007 through habeas corpus, claiming immigrants had the right to a bond hearing without "prolonged" detention according to 8 U.S.C. 1225. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed his entry deciding detained immigrants had the right to a periodic hearing if one had not already been held after 6 months. 
The Court of Appeal's decision was reversed by the Supreme Court in a plurality opinion after granting a writ of certiorari in June 2016. Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority and concluded that no provision of 8 U.S.C. 1225 limits length of detention to six months, or suggests length of detention should be a factor when deciding on release of a detained immigrant.

Typescript of the Second Origin

Typescript of the Second Origin (Catalan: "Mecanoscrit del segon origen") is a science fiction novel written by Manuel de Pedrolo in 1974, that had a great success and that has become one of the best-selling books of Catalan literature. The work is divided into 6 chapters, the first 5 of them having a similar extension and being called "Quaderns" (Catalan word for "Notebooks") and the last of them being short and entitled «És l'Alba la mare de la humanitat actual?» ("Is Alba the mother of current humanity?"). The novel was published in English in 2017 by Wesleyan University Press.
It was brought to television by a very successful TV series produced and displayed by TV3, and in 2015 it was adapted for the big screen with the film "Segon origen".
Plot.
In this novel de Pedrolo tells the story of Alba and Dídac, 14 and 9 years old respectively, who live in a Catalan town called Benaura. They become the only survivors on Earth after extraterrestrials destroy almost all humanity. Before the invasion, Dídac is attacked by some neb from the town because he is black. He falls into the water, and Alba, who sees the scene, jumps in to save him. Being under the water protects them from destruction.
During the following four years, they survive in a destroyed world and face many and varied troubles and difficulties that make them mature quickly. They realise the importance of knowledge by keeping and reading books. They run away from the pestilence and take refuge in a farmhouse, where they find dead people and survivors. They walk by the ruins of Barcelona and the Mediterranean Sea. They learn from everything that happens to them (illnesses, enemy defense) and from the information they collect. 
The book explores the relationship between the two children and the recreation of a world as a utopia. The narration is structured in chapters that always start the same way: by mentioning Alba's age and her virginity. 
The narrator is omniscient and uses much description.
Translations.
The novel has been translated to Spanish (1984), to Dutch (1986), to Basque (1989), to Galician (1989), to French (1993), to Romanian (2000), to Portuguese (2004) and to Italian (2011).

This song is about loving those around you and how treating people with love creates more love."
Reception.
Thomas Bleach called the song "a polished synth pop track that looks at looking out for each other and treating everyone well. A basic message that the world truly needs right now."

InstantTV

InstantTV is a cloud software digital video recorder (DVR) operated by RecordTV Pte Ltd based in Singapore. The company was founded by Carlos Nicholas Fernandes in 2007 and previously offered services as RecordTV.com.
History.
RecordTV.com was originally a US-based company that provided cloud-based recording of any and all cable TV channels its founder, David Simon, had subscribed to, by any user on the Internet. The MPAA sued Simon for copyright infringement. Simon initially hired Ira Rothken to defend against the litigation, but eventually gave up, settled and decided to sell its assets.
Launch in Singapore.
Fernandes purchased the assets of RecordTV.com from Simon, but then invented (and patented) "A System and Method for recording television and/or radio programmes via the Internet". Among other things, the RecordTV.com service was restricted to Singapore users alone and users were able to record only Singapore Free-to-Air content, which was broadcast by Singapore's state-owned broadcaster, MediaCorp. Shortly thereafter, on 24 July 2017 and 27 September 2017, RecordTV.com received two cease and desist letters alleging infringement by MediaCorp.
RecordTV Pte Ltd vs. MediaCorp litigation.
RecordTV Pte Ltd refused to comply with the demand to shut down its website. After the first cease and desist letter from MediaCorp, RecordTV's lawyers wrote back, alleging that MediaCorp's move was "calculated to stifle innovation and the growth of a new industry" according to an article by Singapore Press Holdings that was republished. After the second, September cease and desist letter was received, RecordTV preemptively sued MediaCorp for groundless threats of copyright infringement proceedings, claimed S$30.5 million in damages and continued to operate its website.
One of the core legal issues that arose was whether RecordTV.com was recording content on behalf of its users or whether the users were using RecordTV.com to record TV shows they would otherwise be entitled to see. This was significant because the case would turn on the identity of the party making the copy – if it was the consumer, it could be considered for time-shifting and domestic use and therefore legal. If it was the company, then, the company was recording it for commercial use and therefore illegal. Thus, the case would turn based on the identity of the party making the copy. MediaCorp was represented by Drew and Napier CEO and Senior Counsel Davinder Singh, who cross-examined RecordTV CEO Fernandes over 3.5 days during the trial. RecordTV lost the lawsuit in the High Court of Singapore.
In the initial, adverse judgment against RecordTV, Justice Ang of the High Court cited copyright law specialist William Patry. Following the judgment, Patry stated that in his view Justice Ang had erred in a blog post called the "Singaporean Cablevision case", where he asserted that the court had misread the Cablevision ruling and should have found in favour or RecordTV. David Post, a legal scholar and co-author of an amicus curiae brief in support of Cablevision, also indicated through his writings that the court should have found in favour of RecordTV.
RecordTV chose to appeal the ruling. In its ruling, at the onset, the Court of Appeals set out the importance of the case for society:
The Court of Appeals ruled in favour of RecordTV, awarded costs and damages and issued an injunction against MediaCorp from issuing further threats against RecordTV. In reversing the ruling of the lower court, the Court of Appeals summarised its conclusion:
Following the victory, ZDNET quoted Fernandes as saying,
The litigation was described as a "David vs. Goliath" battle that came to "its familiar conclusion", on the front page of the "Business Times" newspaper. Fernandes was subsequently named Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum.
Relaunch.
As a result of the initial adverse ruling in the High Court, RecordTV had shut down its website. Following the reversal by the Court of Appeals, RecordTV relaunched the website. In October 2014, RecordTV launched an app called InstantTV that targeted the global market, including free channels for Thailand, Japan, Indonesia, United States and United Kingdom markets. The facility to record and play Singapore channels persisted, although it continued to be geographically restricted to Singapore IP addresses. The InstantTV app on the Android Play Store went from 10,000 installs on 4 November 2014 to 100,000 installs - a 1000% increase by 3 August 2015, in 7 months.

History of Debreceni VSC

Debreceni Vasutas Sport Club is a professional Hungarian football club based in Debrecen, Hungary.
Early years (1902–1942).
The club was founded on 12 March 1902, initially being known as "Egyetértés Futball Club" but on becoming independent it was renamed ""Debreceni Vasutas Sport Club" (Debrecen Railway Sports Club)". In 1926 professionalism came to the Hungarian football scene, with the unfortunate result that Bocskai FC was formed using players from DVSC and city rivals DKASE and DTE, with the result that Bocskai FC ruled the football roost in Debrecen for 15 years while DVSC continued to struggle in the lower divisions. In 1940 the professional/amateur division of players was abolished and Bocskai FC suffered financial collapse, returning DVSC to top-dog position in the city. Debrecen reached the Hungarian First Division for the first time in 1942–43, but then suffered something of a yo-yo existence for the next fifty years, suffering eight relegations in all, and even starting the 1967 season in the Third Division. During this period the club underwent a number of name changes. It became "Debreceni Vasutas Sport Egyesület" in 1948–49, "Debreceni Lokomotiv" (hence the nickname) in 1949, "Debreceni Törekvés" in the 1955–56 season, and it was known as "Debreceni Vasutas SC" from 1957 to 1979. In 1979 the two city teams, DVSC and DMTE were united into one team, called DMVSC, but after ten years the clubs split again and the team adopted its current name.
Back to the First Division.
Debrecen's most successful period has been since its most recent promotion to the First Division in 1993, since when the club has won its only national honours – the Hungarian Cup was won in 1999 and 2001, and the Hungarian League title for the first time in 2005. Although the team was relegated from top flight football in 2001 as a result of questionable refereeing on home matches (Ref. Béla Kiss was helped to escape from the stadium by officials in order to avoid the crowd's anger after the match against Budapest Honvéd FC), the then promoted BKV Előre SC could not afford to play in the first league in lack of the necessary financial conditions, thus DVSC remained in the top flight as the better relegated team according to the rules and regulations of the championship which led to some controversy whether it was just.&lt;br&gt;
The first international matches were played in 1998 in the Intertoto Cup. Debreceni VSC beat Dnepr Mogilev, FC Hradec Králové, Hansa Rostock, and lost to Ruch Chorzów in the semi-finals.&lt;br&gt;
In 1999 Debrecen played in the first round of the UEFA Cup 1999-00 and they were beaten by the German VfL Wolfsburg 3–2 on aggregate. Although Debrecen beat the German club 2–1 at home, they lost 2–0 in the away-game, and their first UEFA Cup season ended.
2000s: Golden years.
Debrecen won the 2000–01 Magyar Kupa. Therefore, in 2001 Debrecen they could enter the UEFA Cup 2001-02 where they beat the Moldovan club Nistru Otaci 3–1 on aggregate in the first round. In the second round of the UEFA Cup Debrecen played with the French club Bordeaux. They lost 5–1 away, but beat the French club 3–1 at home.
Debrecen finished third in the 2002-03 Nemzeti Bajnokság I season. Therefore, they entered the UEFA Cup 2003-04 season. Debrecen drew with the Lithuanian club FK Ekranas in the first leg of the qualifiers, while in the second leg the result was the same. After extra time Debrecen scored a goal and won 3–2 on aggregate. In the first round they had to face NK Varteks. Debrecen won both matches, 3–1 in the first leg and 3–2 in the second leg. The team won 6–3 on aggregate causing the resignation of the coach of the Croatian club. In the second round Debrecen faced with the Greek PAOK. In the first leg they drew 1–1 in the Toumba Stadium in Thessaloniki, Greece. At home the result was a goalless draw, therefore Debrecen went through on away goals (1–1). Debrecen's first successful UEFA Cup career was ended in the third round when they faced with the Belgian Club Brugge. In the first leg Debrecen was beaten by 1–0 in Jan Breydel Stadium, Bruges, Belgium. The goalless second leg resulted the end of the march of the Hungarian club.
In the 2003–04 Nemzeti Bajnokság I season Debrecen finished third, therefore they could play in the UEFA Intertoto Cup 2004–05 season. In the first round Debrecen faced with the Slovak club Spartak Trnava. In the first leg Debrecen lost 3–0 in Trnava, Slovakia, while at home they won 4–1. Debrecen were eliminated from the Intertoto Cup on away goals (4–4).
In 2005 Debrecen won their first Hungarian National Championship title preceding Ferencváros by six points. As a consequence the team could play in the UEFA Champions League for the first time. The first match in the UEFA Champions League 2005-06 qualifiers was played in 2005 against the Croatian club, Hajduk Split. Debreceni VSC beat the Croatian rivals 8–0 on aggregate beating Hajduk Split 3–0 at home and 5–0 away. In the next round Debreceni VSC had to face one of the best teams in Europe, Manchester United and lost 0–6 on aggregate. Debrecen could have consoled themselves in the 2005–06 UEFA Cup, but they had to face the Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk. In the first leg (15 September 2005) the Ukrainian club beat Debrecen 4–1 in the RSC Olimpiyskiy stadium in Donetsk, Ukraine. The only Hungarian goal was scored by Sidibe. In the second leg (29 September 2005) Debrecen lost 2–0 in the Stadion Oláh Gábor Út. Debrecen were eliminated 6–1 on aggregate.
Debrecen managed to duplicate the feat and win the Hungarian National Championship I 2005-06, after in the last round on 3 June, they defeated Pápa 4–1, and the then the leader of the league Újpest (who had the same number of points as Debrecen but had more away wins) lost to Fehérvár in a climactic battle ending in 3–1, which also caused Fehérvár to place 3rd.
In the qualifiers of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League Debrecen faced with Macedonian champion Rabotnički Skopje. In the first leg (26 July 2006) Debrecen drew at home in the Stadion Oláh Gábor Út. the Hungarian goal was scored by Róbert Zsolnai. In the second leg (2 August 2006) Debrecen took the lead by a goal by Sidibe in the 20th minute, but Rabotnicki scored four more goals. Debrecen were eliminated from the UEFA Champions League on 5–2 aggregate. After being eliminated from the Champions League Supka resigned 
In the Hungarian National Championship I 2006-07 season Debrecen became again champion on the 28th match-day beating Rákospalotai EAC on home turf. Debrecen became the first non-Budapest team winning the Hungarian title for the third time in a row.
András Herczeg's first trophy was won against Budapest Honvéd by 4–1 on aggregate. The first leg finished 1–1 in the Bozsik Stadion. In the second leg Dzsudzsák scored twice, while the third goals was scored by Kiss.
In the UEFA Champions League 2007-08 season Debrecen entered in the second qualifying round. Debrecen faced with the Swedish champion Elfsborg. The Swedish club won the first leg by 1–0, while a goalless draw in Sweden was enough for Elfsborg to go through the third qualifying round. Debreceni VSC were eliminated from the UEFA Champions League 1–0 on aggregate.
In the 2007–08 Nemzeti Bajnokság I season Debrecen finished second while MTK became first. Debrecen won the 2007–08 Magyar Kupa season by beating Budapest Honvéd in the final 9–1 on aggregate.

Shia Islam in Bangladesh

 
Shia Muslims are a large minority in Bangladesh, with roughly 2% of the population being Shia. Many Bangladeshi Shi'a Muslims, belong to the Bihari community. Even though there are only small numbers of Shi'as, the observance commemorating the martyrdom of Ali's sons, Hasan and Husayn, are still widely observed by the nation's Sunni community; highlighting the historical influence that the Shi'ites had in Bengal.
Distribution.
Among the Shias, the Dawoodi Bohra community is concentrated in Chittagong as well as the Nizari Ismaili community also found in Dhaka. The Hussaini Dalan in Bakhshibazar, Dhaka is the largest Shia masjid and the main Hussainiya of the country. There are numerous Imambaras and Shia mosques across Dhaka in places such as Adabar, Paltan, Mohammadpur, Farashganj and Azimpur. Twelver communities reside in the northeastern Sylhet Division in places such as Kulaura and Rajtila, and have ties with the Prithimpassa family. In Bhandaria, Firozpur, there is the Twin Mosque of Bhelai Chokdar which is a relic of Shia interactions in southern Bangladesh. In contrast, the Shalbari Mosque in Thakurgaon, northern Bangladesh, dates as late as 1888. There are also imambaras in Manikganj, Kishoreganj, Austagram and Saidpur.
History.
Most of the Twelvers migrated to South Asia to prosper and obtain high positions in various Sultanates and later Mughal Empire. Many were also rebels and nobles who lost royal favour in Persia. The Mughals also preferred to employ foreign Muslim officials that had no local interests and thus were loyal to the emperor. All the Nawabs of Bengal happened to be Shia Muslims.
During the Sultanate era, Sakhi Salamat, a Shia nobleman from Isfahan, settled in the village of Prithimpassa in Kulaura in 1499. His son, Ismail Khan Lodhi, was granted numerous jagirs and the Prithimpassa family thereon became one of the principal families of Greater Sylhet belonging to the erstwhile feudal nobility of eastern Bengal.
Mughal era.
The oldest Shia imambara in the country was the Bibi Ka Rauza in Farashganj, Dhaka, constructed in 1608 by Amir Khan. The building is not fully extant though. During the reign of emperor Jahangir, a Shi'ite by the name of Ibrahim Khan Fath-i-Jang was given the Subahdari (governorship) of Bengal in 1617 and so he set off for Dhaka, bringing many fellow Shi'ites alongside him.
The Sunni governor of Mughal Bengal Shah Shuja's mother, two wives and teacher were all Shi'ites. So many of Shuja's courtiers were Shia such that a saying became prevalent in Dhaka that Shuja had brought with him 300 Shi'ites whom he got settled in different parts of Bengal. Although a staunch Sunni, his rivals in Delhi even started to spread rumours that Shuja had converted to Shi'ism. It was during his term in 1642, that the naval chief Sayyid Murad constructed the Hussaini Dalan in Dhaka.
The next two governors of Mughal Bengal, Mir Jumla II and Shaista Khan, also belonged to the Shia faith.
Mir Sayyid Shakrullah al-Husayni of Najaf was one of the Shia noblemen brought by Shuja, and he was the ancestor of Nawab Sayyid Chottan Saheb, who had a large estate in Abul Hasnat Road in Dhaka. The estate contains the Mohammadi Begum Imambara, which was built in 1707.
From 1717 until 1880, three successive Nawab dynasties – the Nasiri, Afshar and Najafi – ruled over Bengal, and all belonged to the Shia faith.
Murshid Quli Khan was originally born into a poor Deccani Hindu family, before being sold into slavery and bought by Haji Shafi, a Persian merchant from Isfahan who had converted him to Shia Islam. He later worked his way up, eventually becoming the first of the Nawabs of Bengal and founding the Nasiri dynasty. He transferred Bengal's capital from Jahangirnagar (Dhaka) to Murshidabad in present-day India.
The second dynasty, the Afshar, ruled from 1740 to 1757 and was founded by the Shia-born Alivardi Khan. Siraj ud-Daulah, the last of the Ashfar and the most well-known of the Nawabs, was killed in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 by the British East India Company. He was succeeded by Shia-born Mir Jafar who founded the third and final Nawab dynasty of Bengal, the Najafi.
Colonial era.
Mir Ashraf Ali (d. 1829), a devout Shi'ite from Shiraz, migrated to Dhaka in the 18th century where he gained prominence as a landlord and courtier to the Naib Nazims of Dhaka. With properties spreading across Dhaka, Comilla, Barisal, Mymensingh and Chittagong; Ali became the wealthiest person in eastern Bengal in his time, with hundreds of employed farmers and numerous charitable donations towards the city of Dhaka. In response to Shah Abdul Aziz's famous criticism on the Twelver ideology, Ali sent a large sum of money to Iraq in return for a response to the criticism by the senior Shi'ite clerics there. It is unknown whether a response was given. 
In 1799, Agha Muhammad Reza, a Mughal Shia nobleman in Sylhet of Iranian origin rebelled against the East India Company. Gaining support from thousands of peasants after claiming to be a Sufi saint, Reza successfully invaded the nearby Kachari Kingdom. Later proclaiming himself as the Mahdi (promised messiah) and twelfth imam, he was captured and imprisoned in Calcutta.
In 1861, the Bibi Ka Rauza Imambara in Farashganj, Dhaka was renovated by RM Doshanji. In the 19th century, descendants of the Shia zamindar family of Sitalpur in Purnia, Bihar migrated to the village of Sindurna in Thakurgaon in modern-day Bangladesh. Shaykh Muhammad Raj of this family built the Shalbari Mosque for the Shia community in the village in 1888, and the site remains a popular tourist attraction. In 1891, the Mir Yaqub Imambara was constructed in 1 Hussaini Dalan Road, Dhaka. It was refurbished in 2004 by the Shia Anjuman-e-Husayni.
Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the Quaid-e-Azam ("the Great Leader"), the founder of the Dominion of Pakistan (which Bangladesh was a part of until 1971), was born into an Ismaili Shia family although later in life he followed Twelver Shia Islam.
Contemporary Persecution.
Despite a long and rich history in the country, presently Shi'ite groups are the target of sectarian violence. For instance, in 2015 a Shi'ite Ashura gathering was bombed.

Connie Lawn

Constance Ellen Lawn (May 14, 1944 – April 2, 2018) was an American broadcast journalist. Lawn had a brief career in politics, working for a congressman and the 1968 Eugene McCarthy presidential campaign before entering journalism.
She reported from Washington for several international clients and was appointed an honorary Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2012 in recognition of her work. At the time of her death she was the longest-serving White House correspondent.
Early life.
Of Russian Jewish descent, Lawn was born in New Jersey to Howard Martin Lawn (1911–2000), a businessman who was president of Parkmobile Inc., and the Equity and Capital Company, and Pearl H. Bergman (1913–1989), a chemist and homemaker. Both her parents were staunch Democrats.
Her paternal grandfather, Sal Simon Lawn (1884–1969), was a Republican, who served as sergeant-at-arms for the Second Judicial Court and was a veteran of World War I.
Lawn was raised with her brother, Richard, and elder sister, Margo Rose (1940–1981).
She was the first and only girl to play for the Long Branch Little League in 1956. In 1962, Lawn graduated from Long Branch High School, and went on to receive a bachelor's degree in political science from Simmons College in 1966; she later moved to Washington, D.C. She was also a graduate of the L'In stitut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris.
Political and reporting career.
Lawn briefly worked for a U.S. congressman and served as a volunteer for Eugene McCarthy's 1968 presidential campaign before becoming a reporter for a news station in Washington, D.C. She spent her career as an unaffiliated journalist, unlike many of her fellow White House correspondents, and was the founder and sole employee of Audio Video News.
She reported for several clients in the United States and around the world. Her international radio clients included networks in the UK, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Israel, and South Africa. In the 2012 New Year Honours, she was appointed an honorary Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in recognition of her services to New Zealand–United States relations.
This included writing articles for the US market promoting tourism to New Zealand and its ski resorts. Lawn also received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Press Club of New Zealand and had a champion race-horse named after her in that country.
Lawn covered Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign, travelling with him across the United States. She conducted one of the last interviews with Kennedy before his assassination in Los Angeles on June 5 of that year. Later that year, whilst reporting on the riots and protests around the 1968 Democratic National Convention, Lawn was beaten by Chicago police officers. She covered the 1968 Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia from Prague, the Watergate scandal of 1972, and the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan in 1981. At around the time of the 1982 Lebanon War, Lawn avoided an attempted abduction in Lebanon by hitting her attacker in the face with a bag and escaping to Israeli soldiers.
At the time of her death Lawn was the longest-serving White House correspondent. She attended her last press briefing on December 14, 2017, a few months before her death.
Personal life.
Lawn's first marriage was in November 1973 to Stephen Rappaport, a certified public accountant. They had two sons; their marriage later ended in a divorce. She married Charles A. Sneiderman in 2000.
She was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2011, and died on April 2, 2018, aged 73, in Falls Church, Virginia. In addition to her husband, she is survived by a brother, Richard Lawn; two sons from her first marriage, Daniel and David Rappaport; and two grandchildren.

John Yeates Nelson

John Yeates Nelson (1850 – 29 December 1932) was a senior public servant with the Post and Telegraph Department of New South Wales, Australia and later the Australian Federal Postmaster-General's Department. He was heavily involved in the development of Australia's telegraphy and telephony networks. Nelson is notable for assisting with one of the earliest wireless telegraphy experiments in Australia.
Professional career.
On 29 May 1886, Nelson was promoted from 2nd Class Operator to Continental Check Clerk in the Electric Telegraph Department within the General Post Office. His associate Alfred Dircks was concurrently promoted into the position he vacated. On 2 December 1889 he was promoted from Continental Clerk to Inspector of Telegraph Lines and Stations for the Northern District in the General Post Office. Again, on 16 October 1890, he was promoted from Inspector of Telegraph Lines and Stations, to be Electrician at the General Post Office. At the same time his colleague Edward William Bramble, was promoted from Senior Telegraph Operator to be Inspector of Telegraph Lines and Stations, in his stead. Following upon the death of his superior Philip Billingsley Walker, the single role of Chief Electrician and Engineer-in-Chief of Telegraphs was split into two positions on 10 September 1900. Nelson was promoted into the Chief Electrician position and his colleague William Wilson into Manager, Telegraph Branch. Nelson's retirement was gazetted on 4 May 1916.
On 26 May 1899, Nelson was appointed to the committee empowered to carry out examinations in connection with the testing of Post and Telegraph Masters, Operators, and Assistants, in the Postal and Electric Telegraph Department, with view to promotion. His superior Philip Billingsley Walker was also part of the committee.
Wireless experiments.
The announcement of successful wireless telegraphy experiments at the Sydney General Post Office by Philip Billingsley Walker, Watkin Wynne and John Yeates Nelson was very widely reported around Australia and, despite the relatively short distance involved, represented a major step forward for the Colony of New South Wales. The Sydney "Daily Telegraph" of 11 August 1899 comprehensively reported on the experiments of 10 August as follows:
"WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. EXHIBITION AT THE GENERAL POST-OFFICE. MORSE SIGNALS ON TAPE. Yesterday, at the top of the General Post-office building, an exhibition of wireless telegraphy was given by Mr. P. B. Walker, chief electrician and engineer-in-chief of the Postal Department. Ten feet copper wires were run from the sending and receiving instruments respectively, at either end of the building, each wire as it branched out into space being bright and slightly curved — in fact, the two wires might be said to point at one another, the Hertzian waves passing through the air, as in Marconi's experiments. When the apparatus had been set in position, the following message was sent to Mr. Watkin Wynne, who was at the receiving end:— "Mr. Walker is glad to announce wireless telegraphy as accomplished." Mr. Walker operated the ordinary Morse key himself, and the arrangements were perfect enough to bring the signals out in ink on a tape. The apparatus used consisted principally of a large 12in. spark induction coil, capable of radiating through space electric waves of very high pressure, and of a receiver, called a "coherer." The entire success of the experiments depends upon the arrangement of the latter, which consists of a small glass tube about 2in. long, into which two small plugs of silver are tightly fitted and separated from one another by about one-thirtieth of an inch. The space between these plugs is filled with a mixture of very fine iron filings of nickel and silver. The action of the electric waves, as radiated by means of the induction coil, causes these filings to cohere, and there-by makes an electric contact between the two silver plugs. The latter were for the purpose of the experiment connected with an ordinary telegraph (Morse) recording apparatus, and during the exhibition responded to every impulse radiated by the transmitter. The latter was, of course, controlled by an ordinary Morse key, the arrangement being that long and short streams of electric waves were sent out just as dots and dashes are used in the ordinary everyday working of land and cable wires, although, of course, the speed of the key has necessarily to be curtailed. All the instruments used were manufactured by the Government electricians under Mr. Walker's direction, Mr. Nelson being entrusted with the operation. Two months were occupied in their construction, and experiments have been going on during the past three weeks. The Postmaster-General recently placed £150 on the Estimates in order to obtain the necessary Marconi instruments. The latter are expected to arrive in the colony in about a month or six weeks, and upon their arrival it is intended to carry out experiments similar to those effected in Europe, and especially with the object of ascertaining whether our atmospheric conditions in any way influence the working of the machines."
Nelson's knowledge of wireless telegraphy was well developed and reflected personal interest as much as professional necessity. In a well crafted article over his signature for Sydney's Daily Telegraph newspaper of 2 January 1901, he neatly summarised developments in the field of wireless telegraphy over the last decade in a manner which still reads well today. The overview provided gives appropriate credit to Marconi's advances while noting advances by other experimenters in the field. This position aligns closely with that of postal officials in Great Britain and Australia, already wary of possible monopolization of the technology by Marconi.
Military career.
Throughout his working life, Nelson participated in various capacities in the Auxiliary forces of the Colony of New South Wales and subsequent to Federation, that of the Commonwealth of Australia. On 17 October 1902 he was awarded the "Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration" and at that time he was ranked as Major, Director of Military Telegraphs.
Personal life.
Nelson was an accomplished rower in younger days. He was an active member of the Mercantile Rowing Club. He was frequently a committee member of the club. When the Telegraph Department commenced their annual regattas from 1880, Nelson was both an official and rower. From the late 1880s it seems other interests had overtaken rowing.
On 23 June 1913, Nelson had been appointed Commissioner for Declarations under the Statutory Declarations Act 1911. This was a common practice for senior public servants to assist in the performance of their duties. Following his retirement, the appointment was withdrawn on 13 March 1917.
Late life and legacy.
Nelson suffered a serious illness in 1911 causing him to take leave for several months. While he gave every appearance of having fully recovered, his health was clearly impaired somewhat. He chose to retire in 1916 after 49 years of public service, rather than the more usual period of 50 years as was the custom at the time. Nelson appears to have led a quiet life in retirement, for there are few newspaper reports of his activities subsequently.

Donizetti Tavares de Lima

Donizetti Tavares de Lima (3 January 1882 – 16 June 1961) was a Brazilian Roman Catholic priest. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1908 and served as a parish priest in various churches across Brazil but was noted for his extensive work at the San Antonio church in Tambaú where he lived most of his life. He was famed for his reported miracles and other wonders that began around the 1920s and continued until his death. But this drew some consternation from the local bishop in 1955 who ordered him to give one final blessing to the public and then to retreat to normal parish duties with no more talk of miracles or healings. He did so in obedience and continued to exercise his functions as a parish priest until his death.
The priest had been hailed as a saint his entire life and efforts to launch a beatification process started in 1991. The cause opened towards the decade's end and he became titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue on 9 October 2017 and named him as Venerable. Francis also signed a decree on 6 April 2019 that recognized a miracle attributed to his intercession which made it possible for him to be beatified in Tambaú on 23 November 2019.
Life.
Childhood and education.
Donizetti Tavares de Lima was born in 1882 in Minas Gerais to Tristão and Francisca Cândida Tavares de Lima; he had eight brothers. His father worked in law and his mother worked as a professor. In his childhood in 1886 the Tavares de Limas relocated to Franca in São Paulo where he attended school and learned music.
In 1894 he commenced his ecclesial studies where he soon became the organist at the institute where he studied and later started to teach music to the seminarians; he had asked his father for permission to become a priest. In 1897 he moved to a college to further his education but later returned to teach music to seminarians. In 1900 he commenced a law course and in 1903 commenced his philosophical and theological formation in preparation for the priesthood.
Priesthood.
He received his ordination as a priest on 12 July 1908 from the Bishop of Pouso Alegre and was incardinated into the Pouso Alegre diocese. He began work in the San Gaetano parish and then spent time in the Campinas diocese where he served as a vicar.
In 1909 he was appointed as the parish priest for the Sant'Ana church Vargem Grande do Sul in the Ribeirão Preto diocese where he defended the rights of the poor. This staunch advocacy for the poor led to the rich and his other detractors to accuse him of being a communist. He also helped construct chapels to Nossa Senhora Aparecida and to Saint Benedict of Nursia. He was stationed at the Sant'Ana church from 20 April to 8 August 1909 before being transferred once again. On 24 May 1926 he was appointed as the newest parish priest for the church of San Antonio in Tambaú. He arrived in the town on 12 June and was inaugurated at the parish with his first Mass there on 13 June. It was there that he oversaw the establishment of the Saint Vincent de Paul sanatorium for the abandoned and for elderly people who lived alone. The first "miracle" attributed to him was said to have occurred in 1927: torrential rain threatened a procession of a statue of Nossa Senhora Aparecida but the storm subsided and was quieted when Tavares de Lima led the procession himself.
In 1955 the local bishop grew concerned with the number of people reporting miracles attributed to him and the fanaticism associated with him. Tavares de Lima himself took the chance to stamp out this fanaticism but the bishop decided to put an end to pilgrimages to the famed priest and requested he continue his functions as a parish priest and speak no more of these rumors of healings. On 30 May 1955 – upon the bishop's orders – he gave his last public blessing to the crowds gathered outside of the church. Airplanes flew overhead and poured a shower of rose petals down to the ground to mark the occasion. In 1960 the Archbishop of Ribeirão Preto and the priest Agmar de Paula Marques went to visit him in his parish. The moment the priest saw the pair he told the archbishop of a terrible nightmare he had of a demon appearing when the altar of the church was removed and how the church's namesake repelled it. The archbishop assured him that it was just a nightmare but Tavares de Lima insisted a darkness was growing. The archbishop then reassured him that he would not allow such a thing to pass.
Local officials came to him to seek out his advice despite their initial reluctance to do so and asked him for advice on social matters. Even President Getúlio Vargas spoke with Tavares de Lima about social matters that culminated in the 1954 legislation governing proper work ethics.
Tavares de Lima received a picture of Pope John XXIII in 1959. Father Saverio Brugnara recounted that the priest looked at the image and said that both needed to appeal to God's intercession for both the pope and the Church itself in light of the fact that the Second Vatican Council had been convoked. One of those present in the room wanted to remove the image of Pope Pius XII to place the new one up but Tavares de Lima said to leave the image on the wall as it was for "soon I will meet him!"
The journalist Joelmir Beting once said on a radio program that at Easter in 1953 the priest celebrated Mass at 12:00 pm in the church for people but was seen at that exact time in São Pedro dos Morrinhos at an auction of cattle to help raise funds for his sanatorium. The 1955 healing of José Alexandre Braga (b. 1950) from osteochondritis was also attributed to him. Tavares de Lima shrugged the miracles off as unimportant but placed great emphasis on the conversions of spirit such healings fostered.
He led an austere life dedicated to material and spiritual poverty, following his desire to live like the poor did. He slept on a wooden board rather than a bed and ate okra soup at dinner which was his sole meal. His residence was also devoid of furniture and he had one cassock that he repaired himself on numerous occasions rather than getting new ones. He donated material things that his parishioners gave him to the poor rather than use them for himself. He also could read hearts in confession which enabled him to see the penitent better but could cause upset to some who sought him in the confessional.
In 1958 during the celebrations of Holy Week he celebrated a Mass outside the San Antonio church and made an address. But he began levitating from the ground without having realized what was happening to the great awe of the gathered crowds.
Death.
Tavares de Lima died in Tambaú on 16 June 1961 due to cardiac complications and diabetic complications that had caused several hospitalizations in the past. He died in the morning at 11:15 am while seated in a chair. His remains were interred on 17 June; his remains were exhumed on 7–8 May 2009 in Tambaú for canonical inspection and relocation which was done at night to avoid a large crowd forming. His remains were later moved to his old parish church on 16 May and now attract between 10 and 12 thousand people per month who come as pilgrims.
Beatification.
The beatification process opened under Pope John Paul II on 2 December 1996 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled Tavares de Lima as a Servant of God and declared "nihil obstat" (no objections) to the cause which had been requested since 1991. The diocesan process was overseen in collecting documentation and witness testimonies in São João de Boa Vista from 16 March 1997 until just over a decade later on 16 May 2009. On 3 June 2009 the documentation collected was transferred to the C.C.S. in Rome who later validated the process on 29 October 2010. On 21 January 2011 the Benedictine priest Alfredo Simón was appointed as the cause's relator who would help the postulator in drafting the Positio dossier. On 6 May 2013 the dossier was submitted to the C.C.S. for assessment.
Tavares de Lima became titled as Venerable on 9 October 2017 after Pope Francis confirmed that he had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue in accordance with the cardinal and theological virtues.
On 19 March 2018 the bishop Antonio Vilar met with the C.C.S. prefect Cardinal Angelo Amato who assured the bishop that medical experts had confirmed that a healing presented for Tavares de Lima's potential beatification was a miracle and that theologians would soon assess it. Pope Francis – on 6 April 2019 – signed a decree acknowledging this miracle which therefore enabled for him to be beatified in Tambaú on 23 November 2019.
The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Paolo Vilotta.

2018 Netherlands Tri-Nation Series

The 2018 Netherlands Tri-Nation Series was a cricket tournament, that took place in June 2018 in the Netherlands. It was a tri-nation series between Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland, with all the matches played as Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). The intention is that the tri-series will become an annual event between the three teams.
Prior to the series, Scotland played two T20I matches against Pakistan, while Ireland used the matches as preparation for their matches against India, that took place later in June. Ahead of the series, Ireland named Gary Wilson as their new T20I captain, after William Porterfield stepped aside to focus on Test and One Day International (ODI) cricket.
The fourth match of the series, between Ireland and Scotland, ended in a tie, with no Super Over contested to determine the winner. However, both teams knew that there would not be a Super Over in the event of a tie before the match. The International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that there should have been a Super Over, and apologised for the oversight. In the event, the tied game proved pivotal as Scotland won the series, after two wins and a tie, with the Netherlands in second place and Ireland in third.
Squads.
Timm van der Gugten, Paul van Meekeren, Roelof van der Merwe and Ryan ten Doeschate were all tentatively named in the Netherlands' squad, with their availability confirmed on a match-by-match basis.

Nicolas Ribonnier

Nicolas Ribonnier ( 1525 – 1605) was a 16th-century French architect.
Biography.
Ribonnier was probably from Langres but no documents were found to confirm it. A Jean Ribonnier priest of Heuilley-le-Grand has been found. If he was from his family, his Langrois origin would be fortified.
If he worked on the rood screen of the cathédrale Saint-Mammès de Langres, this implies that he lived in Langres around 1550. He is quoted as godfather in an act of the parish of Saint-Pierre de Langres, on 18 January 1560.
In a royal letter of 1564 registered at the Chamber of Accounts of Dijon, it is written "Nicolas Ribonier, maçon en nostre ville de Dijon" is endowed with the office of "visiteur des ouvrages des places fortes, villes et chasteaulx de notre pays de Bourgogne", a position vacant following the death of Jean de Vaulx.
Between 1560 and 1605, his name appears several times in the inventory of the municipal archives of Langres. He was not a member of the City Body, but before 1572 he was a member of the Confrérie du Saint-Sacrement. He was also a member of the brotherhood of Saint-Pierre and Saint-Paul in 1604. It is in the register of this brotherhood that we learn the year of his death: 1605.
He married Jeanne de Voisines and had seven children. His wife belonged to a well-established family in Langres. We know a Jean de Voisines, secretary of the bishopric, then canon from 1555 to 1563. In 1563, a Nicolas de Voisines appears as a mason on a register of the brotherhood of Saint-Pierre and Saint-Paul. Another Jean de Voisines, master builder, commanded the artillery of the Langrois at the siege of Choiseul.
He is qualified as master general of the works of the Duchy of Burgundy in 1570, "magister lathomus", master mason in 1587, master architect at the Court of Accounts of the Duchy of Burgundy in 1591, architect in 1593.
On May 16, 1593, the corporation of the masons of Langres, of which Nicolas Ribonnier was a member, modified its statutes, allowing it to become a nursery of architects.
Residing in Dijon in 1564, he also worked with Hugues Sambin at the Dijon courthouse. He made the porch of the Dijon courthouse which precedes the gabled facade.
In 1563, Gaspard de Saulx-Tavannes undertook to build a new castle within the walls of the old located two leagues from Langres, while retaining the keep. Nicolas Ribonnier, qualified as architect of the Duchy of Burgundy, is considered as the probable architect of this new castle. The sculptors used to make the castle, were probably Italian sculptors who had been called by the cardinal de Givry.
After the construction of the Château du Pailly, Gaspard de Saulx asked Ribonnier in 1573 for plans to rebuild the Château de Sully. Gaspard du Saulx died shortly after designing the plans with his architect. They were executed by his wife, Françoise de La Baume-Montrevel. According to , viscount of Tavannes, the castle was finished in 1620, but only the main façade received a decoration.
In his thesis, Benoît Peaucelle wrote about the château de Pailly:

Walton Cardiff

Walton Cardiff is a small village in Gloucestershire, England, 1 mile east of Tewkesbury. The village is now part of the civil parish of Ashchurch Rural.
History.
The village is mentioned as plain Walton in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name is of Old English origin, and means "wall settlement", probably referring to the enclosure around the site of the manor house at the southern end of the village. In 1166 the manor was owned by William of Cardiff, and the manor remained in the Cardiff family until the late 14th century.
In the middle ages the manor formed part of the parish of Tewkesbury, but in the 17th century Walton Cardiff became a separate parish. The parish extended to the River Swilgate in the west, and to the main road running east from Tewkesbury (now the A46) in the north. The parish became a civil parish in 1866. In 1935, the area north of Tirle Brook was transferred to Tewkesbury parish, and was later developed as part of the district of Newtown.
In the 1990s a large area in the western part of the parish was developed as the Wheatpieces estate. In 2008 that part of the parish was separated to form the new civil parish of Wheatpieces. The remainder of the civil parish of Walton Cardiff was abolished and became part of the parish of Ashchurch Rural.

2018 Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council election

The 2018 Hammersmith and Fulham Council election took place on 3 May 2018 to elect members of Hammersmith and Fulham Council in London.
Overall results.
Labour consolidated control of the council by gaining 9 seats (in addition to the 11 they gained in 2014), winning 35 in all. The Conservatives lost 9 seats, winning 11 in all. This was the lowest number of Conservative councillors since 1986.
There were no wards with split party representation – for only the fourth time in the fifteen elections since the council was created in 1968. The previous occasions when this occurred was 1990, 1978 and the 1971 Labour landslide.
Another sign of the increased homogeneity was the number of wards where the winning party got less than 50% of the vote – just three wards this time. Ravenscourt Park with 46%, Town with 48% and Sands End with a fraction under 50%. This compares with the 2014 election when there were 6 wards including Sands End with 38%. In the 2010 election there were 10 wards including Addison with 39%. And in the 2006 election there were also 10 wards including Askew with 39%.
26 Councillors successfully retained their seats – 20 Labour and 6 Conservative.
5 sitting Councillors were defeated – all Conservative, including the previous opposition leader.
The ward with the highest percentage vote for one party was Wormholt and White City which saw a 76.5% vote share for the Labour Party. This is the highest percentage any party has achieved at the five elections since these wards were established in 2002. Vote share percentages by ward for previous elections are not currently available.

Higher apprenticeship

A Higher Apprenticeship is the vocational equivalent to a Foundation University degree. This programme will deliver a level 4-5 qualification and can only be undertaken if a level 3 equivalent has already been achieved. However, more recently a number of Training Providers that offer higher apprenticeships do not always require these qualifications. Relevant experience could lead to an interview with the training provider before being accepted onto the programme. 
Higher apprenticeships now account for 31.9% of all apprenticeship starts, with 80,700 new starters on the higher apprenticeship during 2020/21. The higher apprenticeship is the only apprenticeship to have grown over the last three years, moving from 59,800 new starts in 2018/19 and 66,700 in 2019/20 to the current level of over 80,000 over the last 12 months.
Requirements.
Higher apprenticeships have been designed for learners 18 years of age or older.
Candidates interested in this programme must already have a level 3 qualification such as an advanced apprenticeship, A levels or an International Baccalaureate. However, some training providers will offer the programme if you have relevant experience.
Frameworks.
Higher Apprenticeships are now available in over 40 job areas.

Gilberte Brossolette

Gilberte Brossolette (née Bruel; 27 December 1905 – 18 February 2004) was a French journalist and politician. A member of the French Resistance during the Second World War, she was the wife of journalist and politician Pierre Brossolette (1903-1944), who committed suicide while being tortured by the Gestapo.
Early life and wartime.
She was born at 24 rue Vaneau in Paris, the daughter of a bank manager, Gilbert Bruel, and his wife, Marie-Thèrese Deromas. She obtained her baccalaureat from the Institut Sainte-Clotilde in Paris; afterwards, she received a diploma from the Sorbonne and began working as a journalist, employed by papers such as "Marianne" and "Le Populaire". On 20 July 1926 she married Pierre Brossolette, who was three years older than her, and they had two children, Anne and ; the latter became a high-ranking civil servant. In 1940, after the fall of France, the couple began holding secret meetings at their home with a view to setting up a Resistance movement. They set up a Russian bookshop at 89 rue de la Pompe, and this became a centre for the Resistance.
In 1942, after their teenage son had been taken in for questioning by the Gestapo, they tried to escape to London, with Gilberte and the children travelling by felucca to Gibraltar and thence to the UK. There she worked for the BBC and for the Commissariat à l'Intérieur de la France libre.
Post-war and politics.
In 1946, nominated by the SFIO (French Section of the Workers' International), she was one of 21 women elected to the new Conseil de la République that formed the interim government of France. She later complained that it was difficult for her to speak up for women's rights because her position as Brossolette's widow gave her a different status. She was Vice-President of the Council of the Republic (which replaced the Senate in the Fourth Republic). She continued as a senator until 1959.
Gilberte's biography of her husband, titled "Il s’appelait Pierre Brossolette", was first published in 1976. She died, aged 98, at Fontainebleau.
In the 2015 television film "", the role of Gilberte was played by Léa Drucker.

J. Stone &amp; Co

J. Stone &amp; Co was a British marine and railway engineering company based in Deptford (and later Charlton) in south east London, particularly noted for the manufacture of nails and rivets, Stone-Lloyd watertight ships' doors, brass ships' propellers, iron manhole covers, pumps, and railway carriage electric lighting and air conditioning systems. Stone Foundries and Stone Fasteners continue to operate in Charlton.
History.
Josiah Stone established an engineering workshop in 1831, producing cast copper nails for the shipbuilding industry in nearby Greenwich. In 1842, with George Preston and John Prestige, he co-founded J. Stone &amp; Co and relocated to premises in railway arches where he made hand pumps and manual firefighting engines. With the company's product range expanded to include rivets and other engineering items, the firm established a foundry in Deptford's Arklow Road in 1881, becoming a specialist in casting large copper propellers.
The company's non-ferrous foundry moved to Charlton in 1917, and became J. Stone and Co (Charlton) Ltd in 1951. It produced 22,000 propellers for the Royal Navy during World War II (its products being fitted to battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers and numerous smaller vessels), plus propellers and water-tight doors for RMS "Queen Mary", RMS "Queen Elizabeth" and Royal Yacht "Britannia". In 1963 Stone's marine propeller business merged with Manganese Bronze (originally founded by Perceval M. Parsons in Deptford in 1876, incorporated as the Manganese Bronze and Brass Co in 1882, before relocating to Millwall and then Birkenhead in 1941) and manufacture moved to Birkenhead.
Stone Foundries still operates at Charlton in a plant established in 1939 to produce aluminium and magnesium light alloy castings mainly for the aircraft industry, having produced specialised alloy parts and aircraft propellers for the Vickers Viscount and de Havilland Comet. In 1982, Stone Foundries was acquired by Langham Industries.
In 1950 the Deptford works made rail and road transport products, nails, rivets and washers. In 1959 the firm became Stone Platt Industries. The Deptford factory closed in 1969, but production of nails and rivets continues at Langham Industries' Charlton-based Stone Fasteners.
Sporting legacy.
Workers from Stone's Deptford Arklow Road foundry established a rowing club in 1923. Membership of the Stones Rowing Club was restricted to company employees, but after the company refused a grant to purchase new equipment, the club broke away from the works and set up independently, with headquarters in the nearby Lord Clyde public house (western end of Clyde Street). The club was then known as the Clyde Rowing Club before moving in the mid 1930s to another public house, The Globe on Royal Hill in Greenwich (demolished c. 1938), from which the club took its current name, Globe Rowing Club.

Anthony Arkwright

Anthony Arkwright is a convicted British spree killer who, over the course of 56 hours in August 1988, murdered three people in Wath-upon-Dearne, South Yorkshire. Arkwright is also suspected of murdering a fourth person during his killing spree, the charge of which Arkwright's trial judge ordered to lie on file. Arkwright was 21 years old at the time of the killings and was 22 when he was convicted. He is currently serving a whole-life tariff.
Background.
Anthony Arkwright was born in the mining community of Wath-upon-Dearne, in what was then the West Riding of Yorkshire. He is one of five siblings who were abandoned by their mother at an early age; his father was a miner. Arkwright spent most of his childhood in care homes and performed badly at school, which led to a life of crime and a sentence in a borstal. Rumours persisted that he was the product of an incestuous relationship. By the time he was 21, Arkwright was working for scrap merchants in Mexborough, South Yorkshire, but he was sacked on 27 August 1988 for a poor attendance record. It was after this sacking that the 56-hour killing spree began. 
Murders and arrests.
Following his dismissal, Arkwright returned to Wath-upon-Dearne, where he stabbed his grandfather, 68-year-old Stanislav Pudoikas, which resulted in Pudoikas suffering paralysis. Afterwards, he dragged Pudoikas into a shed on his allotment and used a lump hammer to crush his skull. After killing his grandfather, Arkwright went on a pub crawl in Mexborough and dropped hints about the murder, saying things such as, "It's been murder on the allotment today." It was believed that Arkwright's second victim was his grandfather's housekeeper, 73-year-old Elsa Kronadaite, whilst he was in the process of taking his grandfather's savings of £3,000. The bodies of both Pudoikis and Kronadaite lay undiscovered for six days.
The next to be killed was Arkwright's neighbour Raymond Ford, an unemployed former teacher who was already being bullied by him. Arkwright had also stolen items from Ford's flat and Ford reported him to the police for the thefts. Arkwright knew this and wanted revenge. At 3 am on 28 August 1988, he entered Ford's flat completely naked apart from a devil mask. Arkwright stabbed Ford between 250 and 540 times and draped his entrails around the room that he had been murdered in. He then went home to shower off the blood and at 7 am, the police came to arrest him for burgling Ford's flat, completely unaware that Ford lay dead next door. After being interviewed for three hours and then released on police bail for a court appearance the following week, Arkwright went out for another drinking session, amazed at being a murderer allowed to walk free from a police station.
On 29 August, early in the morning, Arkwright entered the specially adapted bungalow belonging to his other next-door neighbour, Marcus Law. Law, who was 25 at the time, was in a wheelchair after a motorbike accident. In what Arkwright would describe as a punishment for all the cigarettes that Law had scrounged off him, he stabbed Law at least 70 times, before trying to gut him. When this failed, Arkwright inserted one of Law's crutches into a gaping wound in his stomach. He also gouged out Law's eyes and inserted cigarettes into his eye sockets, ears and mouth.
Law's mother found her son's body. 
Police arrested Arkwright, who confessed to four murders, which meant that searches for the bodies of his other victims had to be organised hastily. It was suggested that when shocked police had found the three remaining bodies, Arkwright felt that he was losing control, and so invented a fifth victim, leading to further searches of lakes and drainage ditches.
Whilst at HMP Hull awaiting trial, Arkwright smeared the walls of his cell with excrement in a dirty protest at not being recognised and revered as he believed he should be. After convincing prison doctors that he was insane, he was transferred to Rampton Hospital in Nottinghamshire. Psychiatrists there determined that he was sane and fit to plead, with one doctor commenting that Arkwright was "the sanest person in the building".
Trial.
At his trial in Sheffield Crown Court in July 1989, Arkwright pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment. It was commented upon that Arkwright was an "evil fantasist" who had a desire to be as famous as Jack the Ripper. The case against Arkwright for killing Kronadaite was unproven and at the trial, the judge ordered the case to lie on file.
In 2003, Home Secretary David Blunkett changed the law so that certain people sentenced to life in prison, would spend the rest of their lives there, with no chance of parole. This was challenged in 2013, when the European Court of Human Rights decreed that whole-life tariffs without the option for a review or parole amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment. However, the Court of Appeal ruled that the whole-life sentences were "entirely compatible" with the European Convention of Human Rights.
In the media.
Television.
The television programme "When Life Means Life" broadcast an episode about Arkwright in its first series in 2012.
Arkwright was the subject of "Britain’s Most Evil Killers" episode 9 season 4, broadcast 14 April 2020.
Podcast.
Arkwright's case was featured in episode 168 of the dark comedy podcast series, "Small Town Murder".

Bust of the Saviour

The Bust of the Saviour ("Salvator Mundi") is the last sculpture created by baroque artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who died from the after-effects of a stroke, when the artist was 81 years old. He left the sculpture in his will to his friend and patron Queen Christina of Sweden. Considered lost and "rediscovered" in 2001, by Francesco Petrucci, it is currently held in the basilica of di San Sebastiano fuori le mura a Roma.
However, there is some dispute over the authorship of the bust. The art historian Tomaso Montanari believes this version is not by Bernini, pointing instead to the version in the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, USA, which the museum also attributes to Bernini.

A new board was appointed by Irvine and along with his financial director Craig Douglas and Keith Ward, Irvine won the support of the club's financers St.George Bank to trade the club out of the large debt and year on year losses the previous directors had accrued.
Irvine's commitment and commercial expertise attracted much-needed sponsorship and revenue to the club.
On 26 August 2012 Irvine's strategy of leveraging the club's property assets and savvy business management of the club delivered a property deal that cleared the club's debt and positioned the Sharks as a financial force for future generations.
In March 2013 Irvine stood down from his position as Club Chairman on learning of questionable duty of care and ethical practices applied by head coach Shane Flanagan and his staff. The decision by Irvine and his board to sack key management staff and suspend Flanagan on learning of their breaches of protocol and ASADA and WADA rules in 2011 was unpopular at the time and was made three days before the season opening match against the Gold Coast Titans, but was proven to be prudent and correct when long investigations by the NRL and government agencies subsequently suspended Flanagan from the sport for twelve months and sanctioned the other staff involved.

John Paul Mwirigi

John Paul Mwirigi (born 7 January 1994), is the Member of Parliament for Igembe South Constituency, Meru County, in the Kenya National Assembly. He was elected in August 2017 at the age of 23 years, the youngest ever Kenyan member of parliament.
Background and education.
Mwirigi was born on 7 January 1994 in Igembe South Constituency, Meru County. He is the sixth-born in a family of eight siblings. His family had modest means, but they could afford decent meals, according to his testimony. His father died in 2014, but his mother was still alive, at the time Mwirigi was elected to parliament in 2017.
He attended Riaki Primary School and later Kirindine Day Secondary School , where he obtained his High School Diploma. He was admitted to Mount Kenya University, to pursue a Bachelor of Education degree, specializing in History and Kiswahili. He was pursuing the degree as a part-time student, since he had to work to raise his tuition and upkeep. At the time he was elected to parliament, he was in his third year at university.
Work experience.
Prior to his political career, he worked as a laborer at "Igembe Tea Factory", carrying logs for KSh350 (US$3.50) a day. Sometimes he worked at a timber yard owned by a friend, carrying logs there as well.
Political career.
Beginning at age 19 years, while still in high school, he began to entertain the idea of becoming a member of the National Assembly of Kenya. His close friends encouraged him to pursue his dream. However, many others, including close family members tried to dissuade him from trying.
The odds were stacked against him; he was too young, he did not belong to a political party and therefore lacked a ground political machine, he had no money and he had zero political experience.
He stood as an independent candidate. This, according to him, ensured that his name would be on the ballot on election day. He feared that if he joined a political party, he would be rigged out of the primaries, due to lack of finances.
He carried out a grassroots campaign, canvassing his constituency door-to-door, mainly on foot. Most of the resources used in the campaign were donated by well-wishers, according to Mwirigi. He won, beating his nearest opponent by over 3,000 votes and garnering 76 percent of the total.

Morgan v Simpson

Morgan v Simpson [1975] QB 151 is a UK constitutional law case, concerning the right to vote and the integrity of votes and elections in the United Kingdom.
Facts.
Gladys Morgan and four voters in the 1973 election for the Greater London Council petitioned that the election for the seat of Croydon North East was invalid as 44 unstamped ballot papers were not counted. At 18 polling stations, official counters had inadvertently not stamped papers with the official marks. The Labour candidate declared ‘duly elected’, David Simpson, had a majority of only 11, and if the uncounted papers were included, Morgan (the Conservative candidate, and an incumbent) would have won instead by 7 votes. They claimed there was an ‘act or omission’ in breach of an officer’s official duty, and that it affected the result under section 37 of the Representation of the People Act 1949. 
The Divisional Court held the election was conducted ‘substantially in accordance with the law as to elections’ and the fact that small errors affected the result was not enough. Morgan appealed. Anthony Scrivener appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions.
Judgment.
The Court of Appeal declared the election invalid, because the result would have been affected. On the proper construction of the Representation of the People Act 1949 section 37(1), any breach of local election rules was enough to compel the court to declare the election void. 
Lord Denning MR said the following:
Stephenson LJ concurred and said the following in conclusion:
Lawton LJ gave a concurring opinion, and said the following:

National Radical Organization

National Radical Organization () was a Polish collaborationist pro-Nazi organization, founded following the 1939 German invasion of Poland by Andrzej Świetlicki and Stanisław Trzeciak.
In March 1940, NOR co-organized with Germany a series of assaults on houses and shops of Warsaw Jews, known as the Easter pogrom. During the incidents, NOR representatives appealed to the Polish society for participation in pogroms, joining the organization and collaboration with the Nazis against the Soviet Union. The organization even justified the defeat in the September campaign as a fault of the Sanation and accepted the loss of Western lands. "Attack" was the paramilitary wing of the party, operating especially during the Easter pogrom. They were responsible for marking Aryan stores with the symbol of the Top Cross.
The National Radical Organization received from the German military authorities the former premises of the Young Poland Union in Aleja Ujazdowskie in Warsaw, Andrzej Świetlicki was assigned the former apartment of Julian Tuwim.
NRO was initially supported by the German military administration and military intelligence (Abwehr and Gestapo).
After the takeover of power by the civil administration of the General Government and after the ban on cooperation with political organizations in Poland issued by Hitler in April 1940, the NOR was deprived of protection and cooperation from the Nazis. In May 1940, Świetlicki was arrested and imprisoned in Pawiak. On June 20, 1940, he was shot in Palmiry. NOR was dissolved in June 1940.

Nockherstraße

The Nockherstraße is a road located in the south of Au-Haidhausen, the 5th district of Munich, Germany. The former suburb of Au is located in the original flooding area of the Isar. The 500-meter-long road runs between the end of the Ohlmüllerstraße (beginning of the street "Am Nockherberg") and the Kolumbusplatz at the foot of the Isar river terrace. About 400 people live in Nockherstraße.
History.
The middlepoint of the road was two mills on the Auer Mühlbach (15th century) and buildings for hunters from the electoral "Falkenhof" with the tavern "Zum Jägerwirt". The original name of the street was "Jägerhäuselgasse" or "Bei den Jägerhäuseln", as noted in the official register of house numbering for the Au suburb of 1857. In 1876, the street was renamed after the socially committed Nockher banking family to Nockherstraße. Their castle stood on the present Nockherberg.
Beginning of the 19th century (recorded from 1813 and seen on plans of various house records), a dense development with so-called hostel houses was built on the slope side. In the northern part of the street, the hop fishery settled in with five fish ponds. Agriculture was on the decline in the middle of the 19th century. In addition to the agricultural areas, ponds and cattle stables, production facilities began to establish, first with one of the largest bedspring factories in southern Germany and after the Second World War, a branch of Rohde &amp; Schwarz. The transition from agriculture to craft and industry took place at the same time as the incorporation of the town of Au into the city of Munich (1854).
From around 1860, the opposite western side of the street was gradually built with rental housing. In addition, there were four taverns and a sauerkraut factory. Directly adjacent to the industrial district, dairy farming and pig breeding were continued until well into the 20th century. Until the year 1979, a poultry farm and a fish shop existed.
During the Second World War, a large part of the houses was destroyed and not rebuilt on the slope side in favor of a planned green corridor. Today, only a few of the now, modern equipped, hostel houses exist as a reminder of the times. The rental housing on the side facing away from the slope were rebuilt in the style of the respective period from the 1960s and are gradually being converted into condominiums.

Yema (candy)

Yema is a sweet custard confectionery from the Philippines. It is made with egg yolks, milk, and sugar. The name "yema" is from Spanish for "egg yolk". Like other egg yolk-based Filipino desserts, it is believed that "yema" originated from early Spanish construction materials. During the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, egg whites mixed with quicklime and eggshells were used as a type of mortar to hold stone walls together. Filipinos reused the discarded egg yolks into various dishes. Among them is "yema", which is possibly based on the Spanish pastry "Yemas de Santa Teresa".
Yemas were originally made with only egg yolks and sugar, heated and stirred until the consistency is thick. They are then shaped into small balls or pyramids and covered in white sugar. Milk (or condensed milk) later became part of the recipe (probably during the American period). Modern variations also usually include chopped nuts.

The Lethal Toxin Neutralizing Factor, or LTNF, is a protein found in the blood serum of opossum. The North American Opossum ("Didelphis virginiana") is notable for its ability to live through snake bites. The protein could potentially be used to treat most snake bites as it is capable of neutralizing the venom of major snake families. Furthermore, most modern antivenoms come from horse proteins to which many people are allergic. The molecular weight of LTNF is about 63 kDa.

History.
The "1st Ubootgeschwader" (1st UG) was set up on 1 October 1961 in Kiel. It was initially under the control of the , before it was subordinated to the newly established on 1 November. The 1st UG received its first submarine, the newly-commissioned Type 201 submarine "U-1", on 21 March 1962. The "U-1" was the first submarine constructed in post-war Germany. "U-1"s sister ship, "U-2" followed in May 1962. The former R boat "Merkur" was assigned to the squadron as a support ship. The Type 201 submarines were eventually found to be unsatisfactory and were decommissioned early. The successor class, the Type 205 submarine, entered service in the following years, with eleven boats joining the squadron between 1962 and 1969.

Doof Festival

Doof Festival is the largest and oldest trance music festival in Israel. The festival was held for the first time in 2004 and since then it has been held every year on Passover at the ‘Golan’ coast in the eastern part of the Sea of Galilee (Kinnert). The festival hosts artists from Israel and around the world and lasts for three days.
The Doof Festival aims to create a meeting place for culture and electronic music in Israel, a contemporary digital version of the Psychedelic movement in the 1960s, while preserving the values of the international raves movement. Over the years, the festival has expanded its vision in ecological directions of preserving the land, especially the beaches of Kinneret Sea. Today, the festival is a magnet for lovers of electronic music and the trance culture from Israel and abroad, and is considered one of the peak events of the trance culture in Israel.
History.
The festival was started by three people, Shahar Zirkin, Yuval Ebenstein and Guy Barkai, childhood friends who were exposed to the psychedelic rock scene and the beginnings of the Israeli clubbing culture. After traveling around the world and becoming acquainted with electronic music, which was in its infancy in Israel, they began organizing underground desert parties in 1995 under the name Doof Project. the Doof brought with it tougher and more rough musical line that soon brought hundreds of people to their desert parties.
The psychedelic musicians community built around the parties led to the opening of Doof Records in 1999. The label has produced dozens of albums and compilations that have become an integral part of the international trance scene, and to this day it is considered one of the important labels of the trance music. 
After seeing many festivals throughout Europe, the three decided to bring the European atmosphere to Israel and hold a festival of several days attracting people from all over the world and adding the DOOF festival to the European festivals round.
The festival began in 2004 with complete secrecy and at the beginning of the way was based on dark-trance and more underground music. Later on, the teams of Paganka and Magaya were added to the festival, and since then the musical genre has expanded to include various types of trance and alternative music.
The Paganka team joined the festival in 2011 and brought with it Progressive music that gave new layers to the festival. In 2013 the Magaya team joined the production of the festival and brought with it a rich alternative musical system, workshops and ecological design.

Bert Papworth

Albert Frederick Papworth (08 February 1899 – 18 May 1980), often known as Pappy, was a British trade unionist. A leader of several strikes, he later became the first communist to serve on the General Council of the Trades Union Congress.
Born in London, Papworth began working part-time from the age of eight. He first joined a trade union when he was 16, and led a strike at Morgan Crucible during World War I, while still a teenager. He then transferred to work at the Woolwich Arsenal, where he was involved in two separate strikes. In 1918, he joined the British Army, serving briefly before the end of the war.
Papworth returned to civilian work at the end of the war, and joined the Labour Party and the National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers. He struggled to find regular work until 1927, when he began working as a bus conductor with the London General Omnibus Company, based at Putney. He joined the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU), soon becoming secretary of his branch.
The London General Omnibus Company announced pay cuts for staff in 1932. Leaders of the TGWU reluctantly agreed, but a significant minority of bus workers strongly opposed the agreement. Papworth, along with Bill Jones, Bill Payne and Frank Snelling, founded the Busmen's Rank and File Movement, which published "Busmen's Punch" and held meetings at bus garages around London. Many leading figures in the movement also held membership of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), and Papworth became increasingly sympathetic to the party, although he did not immediately join.
In 1935, Papworth was elected to the Executive Council of the TGWU, a position which no communist had held. The following year, the Rank and File Movement led a campaign for a seven-hour working day and improved conditions of employment. When managers refused to negotiate, they launched a strike. This was unsuccessful, and its leaders, including Papworth, were expelled from the TGWU early in 1937. This spurred Papworth to join the CPGB, and he also spent a few months visiting Spain to observe the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, speaking in their support when back in the UK. He was also active in opposition to the British Union of Fascists.
During World War II, Papworth was readmitted to the TGWU, and he again served on the executive committee of the TGWU from 1941. In 1944, he was also elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), the first communist to sit on the body. Through this, he travelled with Vincent Tewson and Vic Feather to investigate trade unionism in Greece, finding that the ruling Junta had imprisoned most trade union leaders.
From the start of 1950, the TGWU banned CPGB members from holding offices in the union, so Papworth lost his official positions. Papworth instead devoted his time to the London Transport Friendly Society, of which he was secretary from 1951 until 1964.

Zoothamnium

Zoothamnium is a genus of ciliate protozoan.
History.
"Zoothamnium" was initially classified as a member of the family "Vorticellidae" by Ehrenberg in 1838. It was later reclassified to the family "Zoothaminiidae", a new family defined by Sommer, in 1951. The unique ability of the central stalk to contract in a zig-zag pattern made the reclassification a necessity. "Zoothamnium" is a sessile peritrich, meaning it is a ciliated vase shaped protozoan that is nonmotile in nature. The genus comprises more than seventy species. Differentiation between species can often be difficult due to the strong similarities in form and function. The most commonly cited species are as follows:
The species can be readily found in freshwater, brackish and/or marine waters between 5 °C and 25 °C., typically 0 – 8 meters deep. They thrive in areas of high suspended solids as they are detritus and anaerobic bacteria consumers. They can be primarily found in eutrophic waters and along the coastal regions bordering the North Atlantic Ocean. They typically form a symbiotic relationship with a wide variety of animals, although some may be free living attaching to aquatic plants and inanimate substrates. Any solid substrate can provide a base for growth. Copepods with chitin covering are the main animal group affected. The ciliate may attach to the gills and reduce ability to pass oxygen to body tissues. This may result in hypoxia due to mechanical blockage and failure to thrive. This attachment may cause Black Gill Disease. or Surface Fouling Diseases. "Zoothamnium" has the potential to reduce reproductive abilities of the host with high prevalence. No histological damage occurs due to attachment, but if colonization becomes too great the host animal may die.
Morphology.
Ciliates that form branching colonies. The colonies can range in size from several zooids to hundreds of zooids depending on the species. Bodies take on a conical to almost spherical shape and are attached posterior with a stalk to the main stalk. The stalk allows for multiple ciliates to come into contact with a feed source once detected, or move away from a potential hazard as needed. The anterior end of the ciliates is covered in circular rows of cilia known as the somatic girdle. The main stalk that connects all of the ciliates branches is composed of a contractile spasmoneme, allowing stalk to contact as a single functioning unit. When contracting the colony can reduce its size by folding in as a single unit in a zig zag fashion. The protozoa can display polymorphism, or multiple physical forms of the same cell. Those on the stalks are shaped like rods, but those in the region of the ciliated oral apparatus of the zooids are shaped like small spheres.
Three different forms of the individual ciliate cells are present at the ends of the stalk, which are distinct in both morphology and function:
Life cycle.
Initial colonization is established by swarmer cells. Once a somatic girdle or circular rows of cilia are developed, a mature macrozooid can leave the mother colony as a swarmer. Once a suitable substrate is found, an initial segment of stalk is produced to attach the cell to the new colonization point.
Once settled, the colony begins to develop. All reproduction is accomplished by binary fusion. The terminal zooid cells will elongate and divide. The newly formed cell will attach to the same branch of the stalk as the terminal zooid and will mature into a microzooid.
The colony will continue to grow, adding additional branching as needed. As the colony develops and resources become depleted, stressed cells can form cilia on all surfaces, including a basal wreath of cilia, mature into macrozooids, and will detach from the stalk and swim away. Colonies may become large, as the macrozooids may not have to travel far to find additional substrate.
The initial colony will eventually enter into a senescent phase, where it will slow or even stop its biological functions of replication and release of swarmer cells. At this point microzooids will begin to die from the bottom of the stalk progressing to the top. A variety of bacteria will establish on the remaining stalk and decompose the materials.

Leopold von Rauch

Gustav Adolf Leopold von Rauch (27 February 1787 – 26 November 1860) was a major general in the Prussian Army.
Life.
He was born in Konigsberg, the eighth of twelve children born to major general Bonaventura von Rauch and his wife Johanna, née Bandel (1752–1828). His brothers included Gustav (future Minister for War, general of the infantry and honorary citizen of Berlin) and Friedrich Wilhelm (future military attache in St Petersburg, adjutant general to Frederick William IV of Prussia and lieutenant general). Leopold's sister Rosalie Gräfin von Hohenau, née von Rauch († 1879) married Prince Albert of Prussia (brother to King Frederick William IV and Emperor William I).
From 1799 to 1803 he trained as an army cadet in Stolp and Berlin. His first posting was as an ensign in Number 36 von Puttkammer Infantry Regiment, then based in Brandenburg an der Havel. He fought against France in the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806 and 1807. After Prussia surrendered he came off the active list but remained a half-pay second lieutenant. In 1809 he was assigned to the Number 8 Lifeguard Infantry Regiment, newly raised in Berlin. Two years later he was promoted to adjutant and became the commander of the Normal Infantry Battalion, then attached to the Foot Guards Regiment in Potsdam. In 1813 he was promoted to first lieutenant and then staff captain. Whilst Prussia harried Napoleon's retreat from Russia in 1812 and 1813, he served as adjutant of the Guards Reserve Brigade, chief of the general staff of II Army Corps and adjutant to 1st Guards Brigade, winning the Iron Cross 2nd class.
In the Battle of Kulm in 1813 he was so badly wounded that he was taken off active service and remained in adjutant posts for the rest of his career. One of these posts was on the staff of Duke Charles of Mecklenburg, commander of the Guards Brigade and brother of King Frederick William III's queen consort Luise. Charles wrote of Rauch: "Equally active and capable. He has an excellent attitude in all his manners and is highly recommended." Rauch was made a major in 1819. He was transferred to the 2nd Foot Guards Regiment from 1822 to 1833 as court-major (Platzmajor) in Potsdam. In 1833 he was put in charge of the Allgemeine Kriegsschule in Berlin, which trained staff and general staff officers and later became the Prussian Staff College. He was made a lieutenant colonel in 1834, just before being made the Prussian commissioner for the Kalisch Review, a joint operation between Prussia and the Russian Empire in the Congress of Poland in 1835. At the end of the review he was awarded the Order of St Anna 2nd class. He was made colonel in 1836 and major general in 1842 before retiring in 1848. He died in Trzblitz twelve years after his retirement.
Marriage and issue.
On 20 February 1827 he married in Prague. His new wife was Amélie von Levetzow, from the Teschow-Koppelow family (6 February 1805, Leipzig – 1 October 1831, Potsdam). Her parents were Joachim Otto Ulrich von Levetzow (chamberlain and court-marshal in Mecklenburg-Schwerin and lord of the manors of Hohen-Mistorf and Teschow) and his first wife Amalie von Levetzow (née von Brösigke). The couple divorced and Amalie went on to marry Friedrich Carl Ulrich von Levetzow (killed in 1815 at the battle of Waterloo) and then Franz Graf von Klebelsberg-Thumburg, former president of the Vienna Hofkammer. Amélie had two sisters – the elder was Ulrike von Levetzow (who inspired Goethe to write his Marienbad Elegy) and the younger was Bertha (who bought the estate at Netluk (Pnětluky) to live near her mother and Ulrike). Goethe had contact with all three sisters and took part in Amélie's marriage.
The couple had two sons, Franz (13 March 1828, Potsdam – 8 August 1911, Netluk/Pnětluky) and Adalbert (20 August 1829, Potsdam – 18 February 1907, Ramholz). Both sons kept in close touch with their mother's sister Ulrike and after her death in 1899 ensured her correspondence with Goethe was kept intact and made available to the public. Franz grew up with Ulrike after his mother's early death and stayed there until he was 18 and remained in correspondence with her long afterwards. He served in the Prussian and Austrian armies and established a collection of minerals and archaeological objects, which in 1912 passed to the city museum in Ústí nad Labem. He married Aminka Zülich von Zülborn (1833–1893) and had one son with her, Joseph von Rauch (1862–1911). Adalbert inherited the Trziblitz (Třebívlice) estate from Ulrike, which was acquired from him by the city of Brüx in 1901. He rose to first lieutenant in the Prussian Army and later retired as a colonel in the Austrian Army.

Gil Cisneros

Gilbert Ray Cisneros Jr. (born February 12, 1971) is an American philanthropist and politician who serves as Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness in the Biden administration. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the U.S. Representative for from 2019 to 2021.
In 2010, he and his wife won a $266 million Mega Millions lottery jackpot and became philanthropists. He was elected to the House in 2018 to represent . He was defeated in his 2020 bid for reelection by former California State Assembly member Young Kim, whom he had defeated in 2018. In April 2021, he was nominated by President Biden to serve as Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, and after confirmation by the Senate, he assumed office on August 24, 2021.
Early life and education.
Cisneros was born in Los Angeles. His mother worked in a cafeteria, while his father served in the Vietnam War and suffered from exposure to Agent Orange. Cisneros served in the United States Navy as a supply officer for 11 years. He earned his Bachelor of Arts in political science from George Washington University and his Master of Business Administration from Regis University. 
Career.
Cisneros worked as a shipping and manufacturing manager for Frito-Lay until he was laid off in 2010.
Weeks after he was laid off, Cisneros won a Mega Millions jackpot worth $266 million. He and his wife became philanthropists, establishing endowments for scholarships to be given to Latino students at GWU and the University of Southern California. They also founded Generation First Degree Pico Rivera, with the goal of ensuring every Latino household in Pico Rivera has at least one college graduate, and the Gilbert and Jacki Cisneros Foundation with an initial investment of $20 million to provide mentorship in education. After setting up the foundation, Cisneros earned a Master of Arts from Brown University in Urban Education Policy, and an MBA from Regis University. 
U.S. House of Representatives.
Elections.
Cisneros was a Republican until 2008, but left the party because he felt it had become "too ideological" and switched to the Democratic Party.
In 2017, he declared his candidacy against Ed Royce in the 2018 election for the United States House of Representatives to represent . He specifically cited Royce's vote to repeal the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, as a reason he chose to run. In January 2018, Royce announced he would retire rather than seek reelection to a 14th term. Later, the election attracted national attention as the "weirdest race in the country" after the California Democratic Party and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee brokered a truce on negative campaigning between Cisneros and Andy Thorburn, who had each spent $6 million on their respective campaigns.
Fears of a lockout by either party were not realized when Cisneros advanced to the November runoff election, finishing second in the June primary election to Republican former Assemblywoman Young Kim, with 19.35% of the vote. This election was rated a "Toss-up" by the Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball. The Associated Press called the election for Cisneros on November 17.
Cisneros lost to Young Kim in the 2020 House of Representatives election for , in a rematch of the 2018 election.
Biden administration.

On July 27, the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) voted to advance Cisneros' nomination to the full chamber for a future vote. Cisneros was confirmed by the Senate on August 11, 2021 by voice vote, and he was sworn in on August 24, 2021.
Personal life.
Cisneros and his wife Jacki have two children, who are twins. They own a home in Pico Rivera, and lived in Newport Beach until they moved to Yorba Linda in late 2017, the year he began running for election. Before Cisneros won the lottery, Jacki worked for KNBC in Los Angeles.

Counting point

In logistics, a counting point (CP; also known as a status point, data acquisition point, check point, or control point) is a certain spot designated for planning, controlling, and monitoring material flow items (e.g. single parts, assembly groups, final products, bins, racks, containers, and freight carriers).
Installation.
If the production and material flow gets more and more complex then more counting points must be installed in the process of transport, shipping, and manufacturing. Especially check points for quality control and quality assurance can be used outstandingly as counting points but also data acquisition points in material handling processes. For better planning and monitoring of material flow items it is helpful to order all counting points in such a way that the requirements of an ideal Boolean Interval (mathematics) Algebra can be fulfilled. Boolean intervals are half-opened and a counting point lays always inside at the beginning and the ending lays outside and is the entry-point of the next-following interval. Such an interval can represent any kind of stretch in production and material flow e.g. an assembly line, a storage or warehouse, a transport route etc. Alternative production and transportation stretches are mapped as parallel intervals, which are logical equivalent but have their own different data acquisition points. If a flow item passes a certain CP it has left the preceding interval and stays in the concerned interval at the same time. By this it can be assured that a flow object can stay only in one interval at a certain moment which is also true and evident for parallel intervals. This kind of mapping material flow structure is necessary for a consistent calculation of the lead-time and complete cycle time for flow items which is extremely important not only for material flow planning but also for production planning and manufacturing operations management in general.
Usage.
Counting points are used in different logistic areas like transportation, material handling, goods receipt, and goods issue at the border of a plant, because this is often transfer of ownership. Other well-known counting points are receiving and issuing material items at the border of a storage or warehouse. Counting points play an important rule also in manufacturing and production scheduling and different concepts of material requirements planning (e.g for the concept of cumulative quantities and the gross-net-method. Counting points also appear in the automotive industry where the production flow of a car is controlled, scheduled, and monitored continuously at exactly-defined check points for different manufacturing departments and shops and where the data is used for scheduling and optimization.

Alejandro Fuenmayor

Alejandro Enriquez Fuenmayor Castillo (born 29 August 1996) is a Venezuelan professional footballer who plays as a defender for Major League Soccer club Houston Dynamo.
Career.
Carabobo.
After coming through the youth ranks with Carabobo, Fuenmayor made his professional debut at the age of 18 on 22 September 2013 in a 2–0 win against Deportivo La Guaira. He made 11 starts in the 2016 Primera División as Carabobo qualified for the Copa Libertadores for the first time in their history by topping the aggregate table. Fuenmayor and Carabobo had a strong 2017. Carabobo finished on top of the aggregate table for the year, qualifying them for the 2018 Copa Libertadores. Fuenmayor started 32 games and anchored the best defense in the league, only allowing 25 goals in 34 games. Carabobo also reached the semi finals of the Apertura and Clausura tournaments. Fuenmayor's performances were rewarded as he was named to the Team of the year.
Houston Dynamo.
After five seasons with Carabobo, Fuenmayor moved to Major League Soccer side Houston Dynamo on 16 January 2018. Fuenmayor made his Dynamo debut on 31 March 2018 in a 2–0 loss against the New England Revolution. He scored his first goal with the Dynamo on 5 May in a 3–2 win against the LA Galaxy. Fuenmayor scored 3 goals and had 1 assists from 22 league appearances in his first season in Houston, but it was a disappointing league campaign as the Dynamo finished 9th in the Western Conference and missed out on the playoffs. Houston did enjoy a successful cup run as Fuenmayor helped lead the Dynamo to their first ever U.S. Open Cup title, playing four times in the competition including starting the final, a 3–0 win over the Philadelphia Union.
Fuenmayor made his first appearance of the 2019 season on 2 March, a 1–1 draw with Real Salt Lake in the Dynamo's MLS season opener. On 5 March, he made his first career appearance in a continental competition when he started in a 2–0 loss to Tigres UANL in the CONCACAF Champions League. Fuenmayor struggled to remain in the Dynamo starting lineup in 2019 and spent time on loan with the Dynamo's USL Championship affiliate, Rio Grande Valley FC throughout the season, making 6 appearances for the Toros. He ended the season with 8 MLS appearances and 12 appearances in all competitions for the Dynamo during another poor season for the team, missing out on the playoffs again.
Fuenmayor saw his playing time decrease further in 2020 under new head coach Tab Ramos, making 5 appearances all season as the Dynamo struggled once again, failing to qualify for the playoffs for the 3rd straight season.

Das Grab ist leer, der Held erwacht

"Das Grab ist leer, der Held erwacht" (The grave is empty, the hero awoken) is a Catholic hymn for Easter, first printed in 1777 in the hymnal "Landshuter Gesangbuch" published by Franz Seraph von Kohlbrenner. Keeping only the first of five stanzas, with additional two stanzas, it appeared in hymnals of the 19th century, and later in different versions in several regional sections of the Catholic hymnal "Gotteslob". It is a frequently sung hymn in Easter services.
History.
A hymnal appeared in Landshut in 1777, with the full title "Der heilige Gesang zum Gottesdienste in der römisch-katholischen Kirche" (The holy chant for the divine service in the Roman Catholic Church), containing prayers and hymns in German for the church services and private contemplation. Franz Seraph von Kohlbrenner was the editor for the texts, for the musical part. The book offers no names of authors. It is assumed that Kohlbrenner and Hauner are the authors of all new songs in the hymnal.
The hymn is part of regional sections of the Catholic hymnal "Gotteslob", with various variants in text and melody. The Diocese of Münster has it as GL 778 and recommends its use for Easter and Ascension. It has been called "a typical hit among hymns".("Das ist so ein typischer unter den Kirchenliedern.")
Text.
 is a new poetry in the spirit of Klopstocks. The original text had five stanzas of eight lines each, reflecting the resurrection of Jesus, closing each stanza with a threefold Alleluia. Of these stanzas, only the first is still common, but was expanded by two stanzas, first found in an 1866 hymnal from the Diocese of Münster. The hymnal "" of 1874 for the Diocese of Paderborn presented these stanzas with a variant of the melody. They appear in the "Gotteslob" for the Diocese of Hamburg as GL 771 as follows:
&lt;poem&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
Melody.
The begins with a fanfare, using a fourth up. The interval also begins all other uneven lines. Regional melodies differ in repeats and time signature. While the original melody was in triple meter, the hymnal "Sursum Corda" had a version in common time. The "Gotteslob" of Diocese of Limburg has it (in two stanzas) in common time as GL 779.

In 1927, he was appointed a Crown Counsel in Kenya and six years later moved to the Gold Coast as a Senior Crown Counsel. In 1935, he became Solicitor-General of Trinidad, and his obituary in "The Times" remarks that "The legal profession there considered Davies to be in the top class as an advocate both as regards to presentation of his cases and his manner in court". After three years, he became Deputy Legal Adviser to the Federated Malay States, before being appointed Solicitor-General of Singapore in 1941. The following year, the Japanese occupied the city and Davies was imprisoned at the Changi prisoner of war camp for the rest of the Second World War. The year after hostilities ended, Davies was appointed Singapore's Attorney-General. In 1955, Davies was appointed Chief Justice of Tanganyika on the retirement of Sir Herbert Cox; he served in the post until retiring in 1960, when Ralph Windham succeeded him.
Davies, who had been appointed Queen's Counsel in Singapore in 1948, was knighted in 1958. He died on 5 October 1969, leaving a widow, Ada Alberta Carlota de Rodriguez.

Bonaventura von Rauch

Johann Bonaventura von Rauch (25 July 1740 - 9 February 1814) was a Prussian Army major general. His sons Gustav, Leopold and Friedrich Wilhelm also took up military careers and became general as well.
Life.
He was born in Peterskirchen/Oberbayern into a Bavarian family. His father was the teacher Johann Anton Rauch (c 1686–1745). He began his career in 1756 as a page at the court of the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and in 1761 became an engineer in the Brunswick Army. Under Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel he took part in the closing phases of the Seven Years' War, namely in the 1761-62 sieges of Kassel (in which he was wounded), Meppen and Ziegenhain. In 1764 he was made a conductor in the Brunswick Engineer Corps, rising to lieutenant in 1766 and captain in 1772.
On Charles William Ferdinand's recommendation, Rauch moved to the Prussian Army in August 1777. On personal instructions from Frederick II of Prussia he became a teacher at the mining corps in the Königsberg garrison. In 1788 Frederick William II of Prussia founded a Royal Engineering Academy in Potsdam - Rauch moved there and was promoted to major. The institution also took part in military surveying and so Rauch travelled to Silesia in 1791 and the Glatzer Schneegebirge in spring 1792. He also began to write treatises on military theory and to produce collections of maps.
He served as a captain of guides on the Prussian General Staff during the French campaign and helped take the fortresses at Longwy and Verdun. He then caught dysentery and stayed in a hospital in Koblenz until November 1792. The king made Rauch a lieutenant colonel in 1796 and put him in charge of the Engineering Academy. He became a major general in 1805 and was made deputy governor of Stettin on the outbreak of the War of the Fourth Coalition in summer 1806, with the 77-year-old lieutenant general von Romberg as governor. After the defeats in the battle of Jena-Auerstedt, Prussia's field army retreat and began to split up. Romberg's morale collapsed and when eight hundred French cavalry arrived before Stettin on 29 October 1806 he surrendered immediately without waiting to assess the size of the enemy force, which was vastly dwarfed by Stettin's garrison of 5,184. 
Rauch agreed to the surrender and so on 1 December was dishonourably discharged from the Prussian Army. He was later placed under house arrest and then in 1809 sentenced to life imprisonment in the Spandau Fortress. His fate led to protests within Prussia's officer corps, especially since Romberg had only ever been a scientist and lecturer and had never before commanded an army in the field. Frederick William's queen-consort Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz took up the cause, but she was only able to get the sentence commuted to life imprisonment in the town of Spandau rather than the fortress, though she did also get half of Rauch's pension as a major general resintated.
Family.
In 1773 at Kunow, he married Johanna Bandel (1752–1828). 
Bonaventura und Johanna von Rauch had ten children:

Auschwitz (song)

"Auschwitz" is a song composed by Francesco Guccini , and performed by Equipe 84. Although the song was written by Guccini it was credited to Lunero and Maurizio Vandelli as the author was not a member of the SIAE. 
The following year the song was recorded by Francesco Guccini and included in the LP "Folk beat n. 1", with the title "La canzone del bambino nel vento (Auschwitz)" (The song of the child in the wind).
Inspiration and content.
Guccini had the inspiration to address the holocaust theme following the reading of the essay by Edward Russell, 2nd Baron Russell of Liverpool "The Scourge of the swastika: A Short History of Nazi War Crimes" (Also translated into Italian in 1955) and from the
autobiographical novel by Vincenzo Pappalettera " Tu passerai per il camino" where he had recounted his memoirs about his stay in the Mauthausen concentration camp.
The text is narrated by two voices: the protagonist, a child who in the Auschwitz concentration camp " died with another hundred, passed through a chimney and is now in the wind". The second item is that of the author who poses some rhetoric questions to which there is no answer.

2019–20 Scottish Premiership

The 2019–20 Scottish Premiership (known as the Ladbrokes Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the seventh season of the Scottish Premiership, the highest division of Scottish football. The fixtures were published on 21 June 2019 and the season began on 3 August 2019. Celtic were the defending champions.
Twelve teams contested the league: Aberdeen, Celtic, Hamilton Academical, Heart of Midlothian, Hibernian, Kilmarnock, Livingston, Motherwell, Rangers, Ross County, St Johnstone and St Mirren.
On 13 March 2020, the Scottish football season was suspended with immediate effect due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Premiership was curtailed on 18 May 2020, with average points per game used to determine final league positions. As a result, Celtic were awarded a ninth consecutive title, whilst Hearts were relegated to the Championship, a decision which prompted the Edinburgh-based club to pursue legal action.
Teams.
The following teams have changed division since the 2018–19 season.
Promoted from Scottish Championship
Relegated to Scottish Championship
Format.
In the initial phase of the season, the 12 teams play a round-robin tournament whereby each team plays each one of the other teams three times. After 33 games, the league splits into two sections of six teams, with each team playing each other in that section. The league attempts to balance the fixture list so that teams in the same section play each other twice at home and twice away, but sometimes this is impossible. A total of 228 matches were due be played (38 matches by each team).

Results.
Matches 1–22.
Teams play each other twice, once at home and once away.
Matches 23–33.
Teams play each other once, either home or away.
Matches 34–38.
It was intended that after 33 matches, the league would split into two sections of six teams i.e. the top six and the bottom six, with the teams playing every other team in their section once (either at home or away). The exact matches would be determined by the position of the teams in the league table at the time of the split. However, the season's premature finish, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, meant that this split was never applied.
Season statistics.
Attendances.
These are the average attendances of the teams.
Broadcasting.
Live matches.
The SPFL permits Sky Sports and BT Sport up to six live home matches between the broadcasters from each club - although this is only four for Rangers and Celtic. Sky Sports and BT Sport's deal allows them to broadcast 30 games each (and the play-offs for BT). The deal roughly provides £21m to SPFL per season. This is the final season of the contract; from 2020–21, Sky Sports will have exclusive rights to Scottish Premiership matches.
Highlights.
Sky Sports hold the rights to Saturday night highlights - however, they do not broadcast a dedicated programme and instead merely show the goals of the Premiership matches on Sky Sports News in their Goals Express programme - which primarily is focused on goals from the English Football League. Gaelic-language channel BBC Alba has the rights to broadcast the repeat in full of 38 Saturday 3pm matches "as live" at 5.30pm. The main Premiership highlights programme is BBC Scotland's Sportscene programme, which shows in-depth highlights of all six Premiership matches every weekend. The SPFL also uploads the goals from every Premiership match onto its YouTube channel - available from 6pm on a Sunday for UK and Ireland viewers and 10pm on a Saturday for those worldwide.

1921–22 Southampton F.C. season

The 1921–22 season was the 27th season of competitive football by Southampton, and the club's second in the Football League. After finishing second in the league the previous season, Southampton achieved promotion to the Second Division as champions of the newly regionalised Third Division South. Following a false start to the campaign, the Saints quickly asserted their dominance in the league when they went on a club record 19-game unbeaten run until the end of 1921. The club also remained unbeaten at The Dell for the entirety of the league season, as well as conceding a Football League record low 21 goals in 42 games, which remained in place until the 1978–79 season. Southampton finished atop the league table with 23 wins, 15 draws and four losses, ahead of runners-up Plymouth Argyle only on goal average.
In the 1921–22 FA Cup, Southampton beat Second Division side South Shields to reach the second round, but were knocked out following a replay by recently promoted First Division club Cardiff City, who had also eliminated them in the fourth round the previous year. The club ended the season hosting local rivals Portsmouth in the annual Hampshire Benevolent Cup charity match, which they won 3–1 thanks to two goals from Arthur Dominy and one from Bill Rawlings. Southampton also played four friendly matches during the campaign, beating Portsmouth 4–0 in a benefit game for club secretary and former manager Ernest Arnfield in October, losing 1–0 to Pompey the following month, defeating Preston North End 3–1 in a benefit game for Arthur Dominy in December, and beating amateur side Corinthian in February.
Southampton used 25 different players during the 1921–22 season and had ten different goalscorers. Their top scorer was centre-forward Bill Rawlings, who scored 30 goals in the Third Division South (one behind the division's top scorer, Plymouth's Frank Richardson) and two in the FA Cup. During the season, the club broke their record for highest league win, beating Northampton Town 8–0 at The Dell in December. Eight new players were signed by the club during the campaign, with seven released and sold to other clubs. The average attendance at The Dell during the 1921–22 season was 11,140. The highest attendance was 20,940 against Queens Park Rangers on 27 December 1921; the lowest was around 5,000 for matches against Millwall on 5 January 1922 and against Swansea Town on 20 February 1922.
Background and transfers.
Several players left Southampton at the end of the 1920–21 season. Most significant of the departures was inside-left James Moore, who had played every game the previous campaign; he returned to his native county of Yorkshire due to "family reasons", joining Second Division club Leeds United. He was replaced in the side by Henry Johnson, who had joined from Darlaston just before the end of the last season, and new addition Len Andrews, who was signed from Reading in August (he had previously played over 100 games for the Saints before World War I). Goalkeeper Arthur Wood, who had lost his place the previous year to new signing Tommy Allen, also left the club in May 1921 to join Second Division side Clapton Orient, where he remained for the rest of his career. Three more players left in the summer, all of whom had spent only one season at the club – centre-forward George Reader retired from the professional game and joined Harland and Wolff on a part-time basis, outside-right Frank Wright returned to his previous position at Hamstead Colliery, and inside-right George Williams joined fellow Third Division South side Exeter City, where he played for a season before being forced to part-retire due to a leg injury.
In addition to Andrews, Jimmy McIntyre brought in another two new players to Southampton before the start of the 1921–22 season. Full-back Harry Hooper joined for £10 from Brierley Hill Alliance, while centre-forward John Horton was brought in from Wombwell. A few months into the campaign, centre-half Ted Hough was signed from Talbot Stead Tubeworks, who were paid £200 and 52 pints of beer for his services. In January 1922, Sammy Meston – the son of former Southampton half-back Samuel Meston – joined from Sholing Athletic, and outside-right Robert Blyth signed from Portsmouth. In March, the club released two popular players to recently promoted First Division club Birmingham, who provided two of their own players in return. McIntyre's contributions were outside-left Fred Foxall and outside-right Joe Barratt, both of whom had played the majority of games up to that point, while their replacements were inside-left Jack Elkes and half-back George Getgood. Foxall had originally attempted to join top-flight side Aston Villa in May, but his transfer was reversed by the Football Association as Southampton had not given permission for the sale (he was also ordered to donate his signing-on fee to the National War Fund).

Third Division South.
Southampton's second Football League campaign began on 27 August 1921 with a home fixture against Gillingham, who had finished bottom of the Third Division table the previous year. The hosts won the game 2–0, with the two top scorers of the last campaign, Arthur Dominy and Bill Rawlings, scoring the goals. Despite this strong start, the Saints were slow to pick up pace in their opening league fixtures, as they were held to a goalless draw at Luton Town and lost 2–0 in the return fixture at Gillingham in their next two games. However, the side's fortunes quickly changed when they embarked on a club record 19-game unbeaten league run, beginning on 5 September with a 2–1 win over Luton at The Dell and not ending until the following January, over four months later. The run produced several high-scoring wins, including a 6–0 victory over Charlton Athletic in November (in which Rawlings scored a hat-trick) and an 8–0 defeat of Northampton Town in December (in which Rawlings scored half of the goals). The result against Northampton Town remained the club's single highest league win until October 2014, when it was equalled with a result of the same scoreline against Sunderland in the Premier League.
The club's unbeaten run finally came to an end on 14 January 1922, when they were beaten by a single goal at mid-table side Brentford. Rawlings scored four goals for a second time during the season the following week when the Saints faced Millwall, making him the first Southampton player to do so three times. However, the club continued to drop points in early 1922, and as a result dropped below main title contenders Plymouth Argyle in the table following a third loss of the season at Swansea Town on 25 February. New signings Jack Elkes and George Getgood debuted against Southend United in the next game, with the former scoring two goals in the convincing 5–2 win; however, he broke his collar bone in the next match, and remained injured for the remainder of the campaign. Southampton dropped valuable points against Argyle in April, when they lost 1–0 at Home Park and were held to a goalless draw at The Dell, with the Devon club pulling five points ahead at the top of the league table.
Despite this points deficit, Southampton had two games in hand over Plymouth, both of which they won 1–0: first over Newport County on 29 April, and second over Merthyr Town on 1 May. By the start of the final day of the season, Southampton were only one point behind leaders Plymouth Argyle, with a superior goal average. In their final game of the campaign, Southampton thrashed Newport County 5–0 in the return fixture at The Dell, with goals coming from Arthur Dominy (two), Alec Campbell, Rawlings and Henry Johnson. According to club historians, "no-one left The Dell" as the club waited for news from Loftus Road, where Plymouth were playing Queens Park Rangers in their final fixture. Argyle lost the match 2–0, which meant that they were level on points with Southampton, who had a superior goal average to secure them the top spot in the division. According to reports, the fans at The Dell "went wild with excitement, storming the ground, demanding to see the players". The club finished on 61 points from 23 wins, 15 draws and four losses; they conceded 21 goals, which was a record low for a Football League season until Liverpool surpassed it with just 16 goals in the 1978–79 season.
FA Cup.
Southampton entered the 1921–22 FA Cup in the first round against Second Division side South Shields. Despite their lower league status, the Saints picked up a "convincing" 3–1 win over the second-tier club, with goals from Henry Johnson, Bill Rawlings and Arthur Dominy. In the second round, the club hosted recently promoted First Division side Cardiff City, who had knocked them out in the third round the previous season. The club held the top-flight side to a 1–1 draw at The Dell, but were unable to beat them in the replay at Ninian Park and were eliminated after a 2–0 loss.
Other matches.
Outside of the league and the FA Cup, Southampton played five additional first-team matches. The first was a friendly match at home to local rivals Portsmouth on 20 October 1921, which served as a benefit match for club secretary Ernest Arnfield. The Saints won the game 4–0, with all four goals coming in the second half – Arthur Dominy "walked the ball into the net" for the first, John Horton headed in a cross from Fred Foxall for the second, Foxall "completed a solo run" for the third, and Horton scored a second near the end of the game. The two sides met again just over a month later, with Fratton Park hosting a friendly to raise money for the Unemployment District Relief Fund. The game was much more even than the meeting at The Dell, with Percy Cherrett scoring the only goal to give Pompey the win.
In December, the club hosted Preston North End in a benefit match for Arthur Dominy, in which Bill Rawlings scored two and Foxall scored one to give the Saints a 3–1 win. A final friendly took place on 18 February 1922, in which Southampton defeated amateur club Corinthian by a single goal from Sammy Meston. Two days after the conclusion of the Third Division South campaign, Southampton and Portsmouth faced off again (for the fifth time that season) in the annual Hampshire Benevolent Cup fixture. The Saints won the match for only the fourth time in its history (Portsmouth having won it eight times to date, with one ending in a draw), with Dominy (two) and Rawlings scoring in the 3–1 win. Receipts for the match totalled £195, which the "Southern Daily Echo" described as "rather below the expected returns".
Player details.
Southampton manager Jimmy McIntyre used 25 different players during the 1921–22 season, ten of whom scored during the campaign. The team played in a 2–3–5 formation throughout the campaign, with two full-backs, three half-backs, two outside forwards, two inside forwards and a centre-forward. Three players appeared in all 45 league and FA Cup matches: goalkeeper Tommy Allen, right-half Bert Shelley and left-back Fred Titmuss. Inside-right Arthur Dominy played all but one league match during the season, and centre-forward Bill Rawlings appeared in all except four. Rawlings finished as the club's top scorer for the season, with 30 goals in the league and three in the cups, with Dominy's 16 goals across league and cup placing him second. Alec Campbell was the club's highest-scoring half-back of the season with eight league goals.

Kalisch Review

The Kalisch Review was a set of military manoeuvres held at Kalisz (then in the Congress of Poland) from 12 to 22 September 1835. It included the Prussian Army and the Russian Imperial Army. Its motto was "Aus inniger Vereinigung entsteht wirkliche Kraft" (From intimate union arises real power). 60,000 troops, over 7,000 horses and over 136 artillery-pieces were involved. This included over 4,500 Prussian soldiers.
In the aftermath of the November Uprising of 1830-31, the two countries felt they needed to make a major public display to the rest of Europe of their continuing close political ties. Kalisch was chosen due to its links with the 1813 Treaty of Kalisch between the two countries, which paved the way for the joint Prussian-Russian pursuit of Napoleon as he retreated from Moscow. It involved both countries' officers practising manoeuvres at army and corps level, though it did not include mock-battles. Specialist troops from both sides also demonstrated their skills, most notably Cossack and Circassian horsemen. The Prussians were commanded by the future William I and the supreme commander of the Review was Nicholas I of Russia.
The high-point of the review was on 18 September, with over 2,000 military musicians performing a concert, including the premiere of the previously-lost march written by Frederick William III of Prussia when he was only ten - it was later adopted as a presentation-march by most of the Prussian regiments and is still played by Germany's Bundeswehr. The Review concluded with a huge firework display, costing 100,000 Taler and involving 45,000 rockets and 12,000 pounds of gunpowder - the largest rockets were three-pounders.

Venkatagiri Raja High School

Venkatagiri Raja High School (V R High School) is a co-education high school in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India. It was established in 1875.
History.
During late 19th Century, There was only one High school named Free Church Mission High school in Nellore which was established and maintained by Christian Missionary. According to then District Collector Vans Agnew, Nellore citizens were against educating their children in a Christian missionary school and exposing them to Christian teachings.
In 1873, Nellore mandal’s first graduate, Sunku Narayana Swamy Chetty, joined the missionary school as head master. He resigned from this position in 1875 due to differences with school's principal, Reverend John MacMillan. Chetty's resignation had further catalyzed the Nellore citizens to start a new Hindu School. Later in 1875, Chetty went to Krishnapatnam to meet a collector who was conducting a Jamabandhi camp there. Some district employees convinced Chetty to take the initiative and start a Hindu school. At the next town hall in Nellore, construction of Hindu school and appointment of Chetty as its head master was authorized.
Hindu mission inauguration.
On 3 May 1875, Hindu Anglo Vernacular School was inaugurated. Along with Chetty as head master, five other teachers were appointed. The school attracted 152 students in the first year.
Rivalry with FCM School.
With Swamy's efforts, the school grew. People called the school B.A. gari paatasala meaning Mr.B.A.’s school. There were hurdles; FCM school officials had developed personal hatred of Swamy and lodged allegations of unfair competition and incompetent staff. An inspector conducted an inquiry and condemned the allegations. Barrow succumbed to the pressure of FCM school's principal Macmillan and called for a town hall to discuss the necessity of second high school. In-charge collector T. Von D. Hardings presided over this town hall, which recommended that there was no need for a second school of higher education in Nellore. After a second collector took over the investigation, the need for second school was justified and a grant was recommended. After further legal maneuvers, the school's grant was stopped. As a last resort, the committee approached Madras Governor Duke of Buckingham and pleaded for his help to no avail. As the financial condition of the school deteriorated, the school started taking donations to close the deficit. Based on the recommendation of Nellore Catholic Priest Rev. C.R. Mitchel, Madras Roman Catholic Bishop agreed to send a donation of Rs. 10/- per month, but the financial troubles continued. Chetty sacrificed his position in 1878 and continued to work persistently for the growth of the school, which resulted in school being recognized in 1879 and receiving government grants from that year.
Acquisition of premises.
The school was opened in a rented house near the city's Collector office. Space considerations led to several location changes until a permanent location was found. On 27 February 1879 Haji Mohammad Rahimtulla, Ex-Diwan of Venkatagiri estate purchased the present V R College premises in a court auction. He donated the facilities to Hindu High School and it was registered in the school's name on 24 November 1879. Rahimutulla continued as a school committee member until his retirement in 1886.
Change of name.
The financial condition of the school was not improving. Venkatagiri Raja purchased a Government bond for Rs. 15,000/- with the condition that the school should be named for him. In 1887 the buildings were in a bad state and the government grant was stopped. Raja's help was again requested; he gave a Rs. 5000/- donation and another Rs.5000/- as a loan which was later fully paid. With this money repairs were completed and three new classrooms were constructed. This new block was inaugurated by Madras Governor Lord Connemara on 12 November 1888. The government grant was restarted in 1889, and as an additional financial security to the school, management purchased ten shares in Nellore Permanent Fund in 1900. In 1901, the school received legal status as a registered society under XXI law of 1860. In 1901, Abdul Kareem Khan Saheb had donated a house worth Rs.2000/- to run a branch school. In 1902, Madras Governor Lord Ampthill visited the school and participated in a prize distribution ceremony. On this occasion, the foundation stone was laid for a new block. The room next to the East Hall on the North Side was built by Raja Velugoti Krishna Yachendra Velugoti Dynasty Bahadur (younger brother of Venkatagiri Raja) at a cost of Rs. 11,300/-.
Branch schools.
A branch school was started in town in 1889, which was re-merged with the parent school after few years. In 1905, another school in town by the name of Akkaraju Raghavaiah Primary School became a branch school. It was also merged with parent school in October 1908. In May 1908, another branch school was opened in Ranganayakula Pet of Nellore but was closed in 1909 due to financial troubles. Between 1912 and 1928, the Mutharaju Subbaramaiah School in Chinna Bazar Nellore was made a branch school and became popular among locals of that area. As the school's popularity and reputation increased, the number of students increased and classes were conducted in semi-permanent rooms that were constructed on the North side of the play ground.
Building.
Construction of the present school building was started in 1950 and by 1964 high school classes were shifted to the new building. Enuga Sundara Rami Reddy had personally supervised the construction of the building from the foundation stage. He completed the entire building except for two rooms prior to his illness and death in 1961.
Based on the recommendations of the Lakshmanaswamy Mudaliar Committee, a seven-year secondary school education system was introduced in the state. The high school was upgraded to Higher Secondary School in 1960 and classes from grade VI to grade XII were introduced. The first batch of grade XII students passed out from the school in 1961 under the leadership of K.Ramalinga Reddy as Head Master. During his era, an incomplete building on the northeast side of the grounds was completed. There was a gradual improvement in the H.S.L.C exam results and by 1968, it reached 83% - a record in the school's history. An English medium was started in the school, which further attracted students.
In 1966-69, the government of Andhra Pradesh had introduced an Integrated Syllabus. In line with this the government proposed converting the high school into a junior college by having five years of secondary education, two years of intermediate and three years of degree education all under the same umbrella. As there was already a first grade college under the control of the same management committee, the proposal was declined. This resulted in the school being downgraded to a secondary school.
Library.
The school's library was first established in 1875 by donated books. At present, the library holds more than 10,000 books spread across Telugu, English, Hindi, Sanskrit and Urdu languages. There are more than 100 encyclopedias. A reading room attached to the library is frequented by students during their recess periods.

Friedrich Wilhelm von Rauch (born 1827)

Friedrich Wilhelm Roderich von Rauch (3 January 1827 in Potsdam – 25 March 1907 in Schwerin) was a lieutenant general in the Prussian Army. His father Friedrich Wilhelm and his grandfather Bonaventura both also pursued military careers. He was born in Potsdam and died in Schwerin.
Early life.
Rauch was born in 1827 to lieutenent general Friedrich Wilhelm von Rauch and Laurette née Countess von Moltke. He was one of six siblings. On October 30, 1863, he married Katharina von Behr-Negendanck (1842-1897) in the German municipality of Passow, Mecklenburg. 
Together they had seven children:
Military career.
In May 1846 Rauch became a second lieutenant and worked from January 1851 as a regimental adjutant. In this position he was promoted to Rittmeister until the end of May 1859. Otto von Bismarck, then a Prussian envoy to St. Petersburg, wrote about him: "The young Rauch is an officer of the kind I always regard as a reserve of diplomacy: his father's calm mind and good manners." Rauch received command of the 1st Squadron in Perleberg and occupied Flensburg with his Uhlans in 1864 in the war against Denmark. He confiscated a number of Danish merchant ships with his soldiers in the harbor, which prompted King Wilhelm I to comment on the entry of Prussian troops into Berlin: "Look at the man who has conquered more ships than the entire Prussian fleet." For his achievements, Rauch received the Order of the Red Eagle, 4th class.

Aluminium joining

Aluminium alloys are often chosen due to their high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, low cost, high thermal and electrical conductivity. There are a variety of techniques to join aluminium including mechanical fasteners, welding, adhesive bonding, brazing, soldering and friction stir welding (FSW), etc. Various techniques are used based on the cost and strength required for the joint. In addition, process combinations can performed to provide means for difficult to join assemblies and to reduce certain process limitations.
Mechanical fasteners.
A simple and cheap method to join aluminium is using mechanical fasteners (i.e. bolts and nuts). Normally a hole is drilled into the base material and a fastener is placed inside. This type of joiner requires some type of overlapping material for a joint to be made. Aluminium rivets or bolts and nuts can be used; however, high-stress applications would require higher strength fastener material such as steel. This could lead to galvanic corrosion of different materials which have varying electrochemical potential. Significant corrosion would weaken the assembly over time and possibly lead to failure. In addition, different materials could result in thermal fatigue cracking from differing coefficients of thermal expansion. As the assembly is repeatedly heated stresses can build up and enlarge the mounting hole. A common place mechanical fasteners are used is riveting of aluminium panels on airplane exteriors.
Adhesive bonding.
Aluminium can be joined with a variety of adhesives. Aluminium may require some level of surface preparation and passivation to remove any unwanted chemical from the surface. Passivation could be as simple as rubbing alcohol or ultrasonic cleaning. Before bonding, a dry fit should be conducted to confirm proper fitting of the components. Adhesives may require heat, pressure, or both during curing; however, the adhesive application should be conducted per the adhesive manufacturer's instructions.
Surface preparation.
In order for a proper adhesive bond, some surface preparation is necessary. A surface cleaning to remove any impurities is made. The surface of the parts to be joined may be roughened with an abrasive such as sandpaper. This provides interlocking surface asperities and increases surface area for bonding. A chemical treatment may also be needed to increase the surface energy of the adherent and remove the oxide layer. Aluminium oxide is weakly bonded to the underlying aluminium metal and without removal, the adhesive joint is dramatically weakened. Oxides layers can separate from the metal substrate and is a key principle for adhesive failure theory, Bikerman weak boundary layer. One way to strength the oxide layer and prevent oxide to substrate failure is to anodize the material. Anodizing creates a strong hexagonal oxide layer with additional surface area for adhesive joining.
Type of adhesives.
Adhesive selection can be dictated based on cost, strength and needed ductility. Hobbyist commonly uses cyanoacrylate (super glue), epoxy, or JB Weld. Silicone may also be used in an application in which waterproofing is needed.
Welding.
Most aluminium alloys can be joined by welding together; however, certain aircraft grade aluminium and other special alloys are unweldable using conventional methods. Aluminium is commonly welded with gas metal arc welding (GMAW) and gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). Due to aluminium's oxide layer, a positive polarity is needed break up the surface to ensure a proper weld. Alternating current (AC) is also used to allow the benefits of a negative polarity which provides penetration and enough positive polarity for a containment free weld. For more details on welding parameters structural aluminium welding codes can be found in AWS D1.2. Aluminium welding typically creates a softened region in the weld metal and heat affected zone. Additional heat treatments may be needed to obtain an acceptable material for an application. Industrial welding is also commonly found in joining aluminium: friction stir welding, laser welding, and ultrasonic welding are some of the many processes used.
Brazing and soldering.
Aluminium can be brazed or soldered to almost any material including concrete, ceramics, or wood. Brazing and soldering can be applied manually or through an automated technique. Manual aluminium brazing can be difficult due to no observable color change before melting. Similar to other techniques, aluminium's strong oxide can prevent proper bonding. Strong acids and bases can be used to weaken the oxide or aggressive fluxes may be used. Brazing alloys for aluminium must have a relatively low melting temperature which is below aluminium's melting temperature (660 °C). In addition, aluminium alloys with high magnesium content can "poison" fluxes and depress the melting temperature which can result in a weak joint. In some cases, the aluminium parts can be clad with a different material and brazed with a more common technique and filler material. Brazed joints require overlapping of parts. The amount of overlap can greatly affect the strength of the joint.
Friction stir welding.
Friction stir welding is a solid-state joining process that uses a non-consumable tool to join two facing workpieces without melting the workpiece material. Heat is generated by friction between the rotating tool and the workpiece material, which leads to a softened region near the FSW tool. While the tool is traversed along the joint line, it mechanically intermixes the two pieces of metal, and forges the hot and softened metal by the mechanical pressure, which is applied by the tool, much like joining clay, or dough. It was primarily used on wrought or extruded aluminium and particularly for structures which need very high weld strength.

He was the godson of Frederick III, German Emperor and the son of the General of the Infantry Albert von Rauch (1829–1901) and his wife Elisabeth, née von Bismarck (1845–1923). He became a military governor and tutor to Wilhelm II's sons.
Life.
Family.
Born into an aristocratic Prussian family, Friedrich Wilhelm von Rauch was the son of the General of the Infantry Albert von Rauch (1829–1901) and his wife Elisabeth, née von Bismarck (1845–1923). His grandfather was the Prussian War Minister and honorary citizen of Berlin, General of the Infantry Gustav von Rauch, his great-grandfather Major General Bonaventura von Rauch.
Friedrich Wilhelm von Rauch was the godson of Emperor Friedrich III.
First Foot Guard Regiment and Military Governor of William II's sons.
After graduating from the Lyceum II in Hanover, Rauch joined the 1st Foot Guard Regiment  in Potsdam in 1887 - as did his father in 1847 and his younger brother, later Colonel Leopold von Rauch (1876–1955), in 1894. In 1888 he was promoted to ensign, in 1889 to Second Lieutenant. In 1892 Rauch became adjutant of the 1st Battalion.
In 1894 Emperor William II and Empress Augusta Victoria  chose Rauch as the Second Military Governor and educator of Crown Prince William, as well as of his two younger brothers Prince Eitel Friedrich and Adalbert  for their training in the Princes' House on Ploen Princes' Island in Schleswig-Holstein. In 1896 Rauch was promoted to First Lieutenant, leaving  in his command and in the position à la suite of the 1st Foot Guard Regiment. In 1898 the imperial couple chose Rauch as the First Military Governor of their younger sons, Prince August Wilhelm and Prince Oskar.
In 1899 Rauch accompanied the Empress and her two youngest sons on their journey through the High Tauern and Berchtesgaden Alps. After returning from Austria, Rauch died in August 1899 in the Imperial Castle Wilhelmshöhe near Kassel of pneumonia.
His successor as First Military Governor was Lieutenant (Imperial Navy) Oskar Graf von Platen-Hallermund, Wing Adjutant of the Emperor, later Vice Admiral and longtime Court Marshal of Wilhelm II from 1911 to 1935.
Grave at Berlin Invalids' Cemetery.
Rauch was buried in his family's grave at the Berlin Invalid's Cemetery and in the vicinity of his grandfather Gustav von Rauch's grave of honour. The preserved tomb of the Rauch family was designed by the royal court architect Friedrich August Stueler on behalf of the Prussian King Frederick William IV.

Marianne Feldhammer

Marianne "Mariandl" Feldhammer (born Marianne Kalss: 14 March 1909 - 15 June 1996) was an Austrian resistance activist during the Nazi years. She was one of the most important women in the (overwhelmingly male) around Sepp Plieseis. She was the only woman who knew the way to the so-called "Hedgehog" (cave-like hut) used by anti-Nazi partisans, to which by the end of the war she had herself made several deliveries of food and/or messages.
Life.
Early years.
Marianne Kalss was born in Altaussee, a small spa town in the extreme northwest of Styria, and a short distance to the east of Salzburg. She attended school locally. Her parents both died while she was a child. She married Karl Feldhammer in 1931. Their daughter Anna was born shortly afterwards. Karl Feldhammer was a skilled carpenter and wood worker who faced long periods of unemployment while his two children were young. He was able to fall back on making wooden shoes, for which the had an ongoing requirement. Through her husband, who till 1934 was a Social Democrat, Marianne Feldhammer became interested in politics. After the events of 1934 she came into contact with local Communist groups in the Salzkammergut region.
After 1938.
Shortly after Austria was annexed into an enlarged Germany her husband Karl Feldhammer, who since 1934 had become a Communist party official, was arrested and placed before the district court at Ischl . He was released after fourteen days. He now began to seek out other opponents of National Socialism in Austria to create a resistance group. Through the Bad Ischl shoe maker Hans Rettenbacher they were put into contact with Resi Pesendorfer, later one of the most important women in the Austrian resistance movement.
Organising a resistance network.
A priority at the time was to keep concealed from the authorities people living "underground", by creating a succession of rapidly changing "safe houses" and providing food for which, in the context of the rationing, those who were not registered residents would have no coupons. The women engaged in this activity also took care of information exchange between trusted individuals in the Salzkammergut mountain regions, and operated a messaging service linking Aussee, Goisern, Ischl and Ebensee. Marianne Feldhammer was employed, officially, as a washerwoman who washed the laundry of the better off families in a river channel at Altaussee. There was no facility for a washing clothes in a laundry using chemical cleaning materials in the Aussee district, so she had a perfectly good reason to make weekly visits to the river channel in Altaussee, where she could contact and resistance supporters there without arousing suspicion.
Supplies for the "hedgehog" hideout.
Pressure on the resistance groups increased from about 1943 as ever larger numbers of army deserters sought refuge in the mountains where they hoped to live "underground" - without a registered domicile, which would make it harder for the authorities to locate them and send them back to the Russian front. It became impossible to find reliable safe houses to accommodate the numbers involved. During the summer months many of the men were able to live out in the open, under the trees, and to sleep in little used or abandoned mountain huts which had been constructed for keeping the hay crop dry until it was needed for the animals. For winter accommodation the communist, Sepp Plieseis, was able to improvise a separate "partisan shelter" for pacifist comrades, using a large cave-like hut higher up in the mountains, carefully sited so that smoke from fires would not be visible from across the valley. The structure came to be known as the "Igel" ("Hedgehog"), out of deference to the family of hedgehogs living on the site when the men started to construct their shelter. Pliesseis had been convicted as a poacher before the war, and was. like many of the local men, able to use his intimate knowledge of the mountains to keep the comrades supplied, although locally available game was not, on its own, a sufficient solution to the challenges arising.
The women in the valley organised supplies for the partisans' secretive supporters, concentrating their efforts on food, but also delivering weapons and ammunition. Marianne Feldhammer was one of those who then deposited these supplies at one of a series of predetermined points, for instance on the inaccessible mountain. At some stage she became aware of the full route all the way to the "Hedgehog" hideaway, and on three occasions, when the need was urgent, she herself delivered heavy bundles of supplies right to the partisans' mountain shelter. There were also occasions, if the weather was very bad, when men came down to the valley to collect bread or meat or to hand messages to the women for onward transmission to other resistance groups. Marianne Feldhammer was the conduit through which messages were passed for and the partisan group in the Ischl region. Like Pesendorfer, Feldhammer was on several occasions summoned by the Gestapo for interrogation sessions.
Death of Karl Feldhammer.
Marianne's husband also found himself sought by the Gestapo, and increasingly himself lived "underground". He was arrested in 1944 but managed to escape. At irregular intervals, however, he took his turn to come down from the mountains to collect supplies and to visit his wife and daughter. On 26 January 1945, during one of these visits, the Gestapo appeared at the front door at five in the morning. Karl Feldhammer jumped out of a window at the back of the house in order to escape through the garden, but a Gestapo man shot and killed him using a submachine gun. While the other policeman concentrated on threatening Marianne Feldhammer with his pistol, the couple's twelve year old daughter, Anna, quietly threw the illegal meat supplies that had been intended for delivery to the partisans out of the window where, thanks to the depth of the snow, they remained undiscovered.
The Gestapo failed to obtain direct evidence against Marianne Feldhammer. Sources suggest that the traditionalist assumption - apparently shared by the Gestapo and the resistance partisans in the area - that no woman would ever enjoy significant influence as a resistance activist, served to protect Marianne Feldhammer and her daughter from any more savage level of attention from the authorities. She was accordingly able to ensure, if nothing else, that Karl Feldhammer received a proper funeral.
Remembering.
After the war ended Marianne Feldhammer lived quietly with her daughter as a widow in Aussee. For a generation there was little mention of the important role played by resistance activists in liberating Austria from the Nazis. For many years the traditionalist Catholic establishment in Austria downplayed the role of women in the resistance movement. In addition, in the atmosphere of cold war confrontation of the period, there was a widespread reluctance in the west to acknowledge the contribution made by people associated with the communists. It was only in the 1980s, notably through the meticulous work of Peter Kammerstätter (who died in 1993) in gathering documents and testimonies of contemporary witnesses, that it became possible for the contribution of activists such as the Feldhammers to be known to the wider public, and to find a way into the mainstream historical record.
In 1985 the film maker Ruth Beckermann produced a documentary about wartime resistance in the Salzkammergut which included interviews with surviving women who had taken part in anti-Nazi resistance. The 37 minute film appeared under the title "Igel" ("Hedgehog"). Parts of it appeared in subsequent television films which were transmitted in Germany and Austria. In 2006 the writer known as Franzobel from Vöcklabruck published "Hirschen" ("Deer"), a stage work on the same theme, which featured Marianne Feldhammer.
Marianne Grab died in 1996. The Altaussee municipality arranged for a "grave of honour" in which her body was placed with the remains of her late husband. Their daughter emigrated and has lived for many years in Ghana.

Anton Gnolistavisdze

Anton Gnolistavisdze () was a 12th-century Georgian politician and monk.
During George III's reign Anton – "a wise and reasonable man faithful to his masters and an able manager" – served as "Mtsignobartukhutses-Chkondideli" (chancellor) and Grand vizier (1179-1184) at Georgian royal court, however after the king's death, Catholicos-Patriarch Michael IV took that office from him. Afterward Anton left secular life to become a monk at Gareja monastery. The turning point in Anton's fortunes came with the death of the powerful Catholicos-Patriarch Michael whom the Queen Tamar replaced, as a chancellor, with her supporter, Anton Gnolistavisdze. Tamar also granted him episcopate at Samtavisi. Anton Gnolistavisdze "a real knight by his appearance and origin" participated in Battle of Shamkor in 1195. He was ordered to bear in front the "Life-creating Cross", which is the scepter and armor of kings. Being a monk, Anton did not keep a sword, but with his two knights, he seized from the enemy three hundred mules and camels.

Adolf von Rauch (born 1805)

Gustav Adolf von Rauch (25 August 1805 - 26 June 1877) retired in 1854 as a cavalry officer with the rank of major in the Prussian Gardes du Corps regiment, to act as chamberlain and court-marshal to Princess Louise of Prussia, wife of Alexis, Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld, who have been divorced since 1861, in the following decades at Berlin´s Monbijou Palace. Rauch was a distinguished collector of ancient Greek and Roman coins and from 1870 to 1877 chairman of the Numismatic Society in Berlin. 
Life.
Family.
Adolf von Rauch was born in Potsdam as the eldest son to Gustav von Rauch, later Prussian Minister of War, general of the infantry and honorary citizen of Berlin, and his first wife Caroline, née von Geusau.
His brother Fedor became Chief Equerry to the German Emperors, his sister Rosalie Countess of Hohenau, née von Rauch the second, morganatic wife to Prince Albert of Prussia, youngest brother of King Frederick William IV and Emperor William I. His brothers Gustav Waldemar and Albert rose to Prussian generals.
Guard officer and chamberlain.
From 1822 to 1854, he was a Prussian cavalry officer in the Gardes du Corps regiment. Since 1842 commander of its Charlottenburg squadron opposite the royal palace, he retired from military service in 1854 with the rank of major. The same year he became chamberlain and court-marshal to Princess Louise of Prussia, daughter of Prince Charles of Prussia and his wife Princess Marie, Princess of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, both siblings of the first German emperor resp. empress. Princess Louise´s marriage to Alexis, Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld was divorced in 1861. 
Numismatist and collector.
Rauch graduated from Berlin´s Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium. Adolf von Rauch´s interests went far beyond his service as a guard officer. By Benoni Friedländer, an outstanding numismatic expert and collector, he was introduced to numismatics as a scholarly discipline. Even during his service as an officer and chamberlain he developed as a knowledgeable and notable collector of ancient Greek and Roman coins.50 selected coins from Rauch´s collection were presented in a special publication in 1843 by the numismatist Bernhard von Koehne, soon after director at the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. On initiative of Julius Friedländer, Benoni Friedländer´s son and first director of Berlin´s Münzkabinett, many of Adolf von Rauch´s coins became part of the collection of this new museum.Today, the Münzkabinett is one of the Berlin State Museums. As a renowned numismatist he continuously published scientific essays.
Together with general Prince Wilhelm Radzwill and Bernhard von Koehne, Adolf von Rauch was one of the founders of the Numismatic Society in Berlin, the first German numismatic association (comparable with the Royal Numismatic Society). From 1870 to 1877 he was its chairman.
The Antiquarische Gesellschaft in Zürich (Antiquarian Society of Zurich) had awarded him its honorary membership.
Marriage and issue.
Rauch married in 1836 to Therese von Ziegler (1817–1857). The couple had seven children, four of them died young.
The three surviving sons followed the family tradition and took up an officer career:
Adolf von Rauch succumbed to longstanding illness in Baden-Baden in 1877.

Georg Decker (printer)

Georg Decker (23 April 1596 - 1661) was a German book-printer and publisher active in Basel, where he founded Basel University Press. He was the founder of a printing dynasty. He was born in Eisfeld, then in the Electorate of Saxony, and died in the Alte Eidgenossenschaft of Basel.
Life.
His parents were Kilian Decker and Anna Göring, who lived in Eisfeld. Decker learned the printing trade in Bamberg or Hildburghausen and on 13 October 1624 he appeared in the Tübingen trade directory as a journeyman printer. After other jobs, the tumult of the Thirty Years' War forced him to take refuge in Basel, where in 1635 he married the widow Margarete Zäsinger - her first husband Johannes Schröter, another printer, had died in September 1634. Decker was made a citizen of Basel on 8 June 1635 and took over Schröter's presses in the Truckerstuben zum Feigenbaum, which then remained in operation until 1745.
On 2 July 1635 Decker was made 'Academiae Typographus' or official printer to the University of Basel, founding the University's publishing house, which his family ran until 1802. He published texts in German, Hebrew, Latin and ancient Greek, including works by Johann Buxtorf the Elder and Johann Buxtorf the Younger.
Decker had three daughters and one son, Johann Jakob Decker (1635–1697), who worked as his father's partner until 1661, when he took over the presses after Georg's death. One of Georg Decker's descendants, Georg Jacob Decker (1732–1799), later took over a printing press in Berlin.

"You Don't Know" is a song by American band Berlin, released in 1986 as the third single from their fourth studio album "Count Three &amp; Pray". It was written by John Crawford and produced by Andy Richards, Bob Ezrin and Berlin. It reached No. 39 in the UK and No. 16 in Belgium.
"You Don't Know" was recorded in London. Recalling the initial recording of "Count Three &amp; Pray", Nunn said in a 2014 interview for "Pop Entertainment": "It was so bad with this guy in England that we trashed the whole thing. I think we kept one song, "You Don't Know," that he had done. We started all over with Bob Ezrin."
A music video was filmed to promote the single, which gained breakout rotation on MTV.
Critical reception.
Upon release, "Cash Box" commented: "A cool, atmospheric treatment shows the musical growth of former synth-pop pioneers. The haunting melody and non-conforming arrangement form a bracing contrast to Terri Nunn's sultry, passionate vocal." Vici MacDonald of "Smash Hits" described the song as "really quite good" and added: "A screechy guitar and a wailsome woman echo distantly over a foreboding, rolling drumbeat and the whole thing's massive, mysterious and foggy".

Utah Medical Cannabis Act initiative

The Utah Medical Cannabis Act is an initiative to legalize medical cannabis that qualified to appear on the November 2018 ballot in the U.S. state of Utah as Proposition 2.
A group called Utah Patients Coalition filed the initiative in June, 2017. By the beginning of the year, the group had gathered more than half of the 113,000 signatures required to get an initiative for medical cannabis on the November ballot. The initiative allows for topicals, cannabis oil, cannabis edibles and vaping, but not smoking. Polls in the second half of 2017 showed up to 78% support for the initiative. 
On March 26, the Lieutenant Governor's office validated 117,000 signatures on the Utah Medical Cannabis Act initiative, enough for it to get on the November ballot. On May 29, the Lieutenant Governor announced that over 153,000 signatures had been validated, and the initiative would still be appearing on the November ballot, despite a contentious effort by initiative opponents to have some names removed.
Groups and individuals supporting and opposing the initiative.
Some groups and individuals have made their position on the inititiative known.
Support.
The sponsor, Utah Patients Coalition, was joined by Together for Responsible Use and Cannabis Education (TRUCE) Utah and by a Koch funded lobbying group with ties to faith leaders in the Legislature, Libertas Institute.
Opposition.
Governor Gary Herbert stated on March 29 that he would "actively oppose" the initiative. The Utah Medical Association urged voters who signed the petition to call county clerks to have their names removed.
After initially "repeatedly declin[ing] to weigh in" with media on its position, the LDS Church issued a statement on April 10 endorsing the Utah Medical Association's position and opposing the initiative.

Sukmawati Sukarnoputri

Diah Mutiara Sukmawati Sukarnoputri (born 26 October 1951) is the third daughter of Indonesia’s founding president Sukarno and his wife Fatmawati. Sukmawati is the younger sister of former Indonesian president Megawati Sukarnoputri and politician Rachmawati Sukarnoputri.
Education.
Sukmawati attended elementary and junior high school at Sekolah Rakyat Cikini in Jakarta, graduating in 1967. In 1969, she graduated from State Senior High School 3 Teladan. She attended the Dance Academy of the Jakarta Arts Education Institute (LPKJ) from 1970-1974. In 2003, she enrolled in international relations at Jakarta’s Bung Karno University.
Political career.
In 1998, following the fall of Suharto, she revived the Indonesian National Party (PNI), which was renamed PNI Supeni and competed in Indonesia’s 1999 general election, winning only 0.36% of the vote. Being ineligible to contest future elections because of its poor performance, the party changed its name to PNI Marhaenisme in 2002 and Sukmawati was appointed chairwoman. The party received 0.81% of votes in the 2004 general election, winning just one seat in parliament. In the 2009 election, the party won just 0.3% and lost its only seat.
High school diploma case.
The Election Supervisory Board (Bawaslu) reported Sukmawati to the National Police in July 2009, alleging she had falsified her high school diploma when registering as a legislative candidate for the Marhaenism Indonesian National Party. Police in August dropped the case, saying there was a lack of evidence as the school's records had been destroyed by a fire in 2007.
Memoir.
In 2011, Sukmawati wrote a memoir about the 15 years she lived at the Merdeka Palace, called "Creeping Coup d'Etat Mayjen Suharto" ("The Creeping Coup d’Etat of Major General Suharto"). She believes Suharto and other members of the military conducted a coup against Sukarno by using the Order of March 11, 1966. She said she cannot forgive Suharto for human rights violations that occurred in the aftermath of the coup.
Complaint against Rizieq Shihab.
In October 2016, Sukmawati filed a police complaint against radical Muslim cleric Rizieq Shihab, accusing him of insulting Sukarno and Indonesian state ideology Pancasila. Rizieq had allegedly made a speech stating “in Sukarno's Pancasila, God is placed in the ass, whereas according to the Jakarta Charter, God is in the head”. The Jakarta Charter was a proposed preamble to Indonesia’s 1945 Constitution that would have required Muslims to follow Shariah law. Police declared Rizieq a suspect in January 2017. He fled Indonesia in May 2017 when also named a suspect in a pornography case.
Personal life.
Sukmawati was married to Prince Sujiwa Kusuma (Mangkunegara IX) of the Mangkenegara royal family of Solo, Central Java. They had three children, and later divorced.
Controversial poem.
On 28 March 2018, Sukmawati recited a poem deemed offensive and blasphemous by some Muslims. Amron Ansyhari of Hanura Party and lawyer Denny Andrian Kusdayat on 3 April reported Sukmawati to Jakarta Police for alleged blasphemy. Her poem, "Ibu Indonesia" ("Mother Indonesia") was a celebration of Indonesian fashion and tradition, which she compared to imported Islamic fashion and tradition. Denny, who had in 2012 been jailed for extortion, claimed Sukmawati had belittled God by saying Mother Indonesia's ballad was more soothing than the Islamic call to prayer.
On 4 April, Sukmawati apologized to all Indonesian Muslims, saying she was especially sorry to those who felt offended by the poem. On the same day, another two organizations, the Indonesian Ulema Defense Team (TPUI) and the Indonesian Islamic Student Movement (GMII), reported Sukmawati to police, claiming her poem was an insult. On 6 April, conservative Muslims, including children, protested in Jakarta, demanding Sukmawati be jailed. They said she should not be forgiven for the poem, whereas the Indonesian Ulemas Association and several politicians had called for forgiveness.

Anton Kutateli

Anton Sagirisdze or Anton Kutateli () was a 12th century Georgian archbishop of Kutaisi.
After the death of George III, the archbishop of Kutaisi, the worthy and blessed monk Anton Sagirisdze was invited, and asked him to take the crown in his hands, because according to church rankings, Imereti, was charged with the task of crowning the sovereign at the coronation ceremony. Encouraged by the confidence of the Queen Tamar and her supporters, Anton Kutateli, who directed the synod with the latter, wanted to prevent Michael IV from attending the synod, However the synod failed to prove that Michael was holding his office illegitimately and was unable to remove him. During the revolt of Queen Tamar's disgraced husband, George the Rus', around 1191, Anton Kutateli and other Church and secular dignitaries were sent to talk to the rebels to find out the reason for this rebellion. but their mission failed.

Mary Shreve (Ames) Frothingham

Mary Shreve (Ames) Frothingham (February 1, 1867 - May 5, 1955) was born into the prominent Ames family of Easton, Massachusetts. She held crucial roles in the development of many local and nationally recognized organizations through leadership and financial contributions. She assumed modesty in her personal life so as to give generously to others. Her legacy in her hometown can still be enjoyed by many at the Ames Free Library, Unity Church, Frothingham Hall, Frothingham Park and her home ‘Wayside’.
Family.
Mary was the daughter of Frederick Lothrop Ames of Easton, Massachusetts (June 8, 1835 - September 13, 1893) and Rebecca Caroline (Blair) Ames of St. Louis Missouri (December 30, 1839 - January 20, 1903). She was the granddaughter of Oliver Ames Jr. (President of the Union Pacific Railroad 1868-1871) and great granddaughter of Oliver Ames Sr. who founded the Ames Shovel Works in 1803.
Political Career and Marriage.
In 1905, she was a member of the Massachusetts Association Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage and became President. This was in direct conflict with her cousin-in-law Blanche Ames, President of the Easton Woman Suffrage League and Treasurer of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage League. The two family members maintained a very genial relationship regardless, agreeing to disagree. For example, when the 19th Amendment passed in 1920, Blanche would often consult with Mary on whom to vote for in the coming elections.
On May 8, 1916, she married Louis A. Frothingham (March 4, 1871 - August 23, 1928) at Unity Church in Easton, Massachusetts. Born in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, Frothingham served as Major in the United States Army during World War 1. He graduated from Harvard Law in 1896, was Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and 41st Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts (1909-1912).
In 1918, Mr. Frothingham was sent to France by Governor Samuel W. McCall. While stationed in Paris, Mr. and Mrs. Frothingham opened their home to soldiers on leave and even attended to troops at the front line in the trenches.
When Mr. Frothingham was running for Massachusetts 14th Congressional district in 1920, Mary served as Chairperson of the Woman’s Republican Town Committee in Easton.
Community Involvement.
Having met Clara Barton as a young woman and establishing a longtime friendship, Mary involved herself with the Red Cross. She established the Easton branch and was President from World War I through World War II. Frothingham Hall, dedicated to her husband, served the efforts of the Red Cross through all day knitting and sewing sessions. Volunteers made coats, sweaters, pajamas and repaired bandages.
She was first President of the American Legion Auxiliary of Easton in 1920 and maintained an interest in the support of veterans and peace groups throughout her life.
Her devotion to the Unity Church of Easton, Massachusetts was noteworthy. Along with her mother and siblings Oliver, Frederick, John and Helen, she gave the oak screen and pulpit at the front of the church and also the Charles Jay Connick stained glass window above the main entrance. The oak carving is that of artist Johannes Kirchmayer and designed by Boston architect Henry Vaughan. She was Trustee of the Village Cemetery, located behind the church, from 1900 to 1954.
The Ames Free Library in North Easton, MA benefited greatly from Mary’s involvement and care. Beginning in 1900, she frequented the library often and would update any technology to suit modern day needs. For example, she introduced and paid for the first new typewriter and card catalog. She served as President of the Library from 1929 to 1955. Her portrait is hanging in the library to this day.
During World War I, she gave each child in town, grades 4 through 12, a thrift card and stamp to foster as interest in patriotism during wartime. She hosted a Christmas party each year for the grammar school students in Easton and provided a gift for each one. The event was held every Christmas for forty years and was reduced to only serving North Easton Grammar School kindergarten after her death. It was eventually phased out as the population and number of schools increased. She installed lockers and showers in the Anna C. Ames Gymnasium, assumed mortgages on homes in Easton that were considered a great risk and paid for the cost of dormitory life at Bridgewater State University for the daughter of her estate superintendent.
Her affection for gardens and public parks was evident in her charitable contributions and causes she supported. The garden at her home was large and well-kept. She commissioned landscape architect Herbert J. Kellaway to design the layout. Harriett Risley Foote, celebrated rosarian, selected the roses and supervised their planting. In 1924, the American Rose Society honored her rose garden with a visit during their annual meeting. In addition, she encouraged a home garden program for local school children. She donated to the Arnold Arboretum in Boston and she was one of the few patrons allowed to drive through the park. Frothingham Park, a memorial to her husband’s baseball career as Captain at Harvard, was dedicated on September 27, 1930. The YMCA and Oliver Ames High School utilized the park for sporting events until the 1980s. There stands a playground for young children, a baseball field surrounded by a track and tennis courts.
Wayside.
Her Georgian Revival style mansion known as ’Wayside’ was built in 1912. Designed by Boston architect Guy Lowell, Wayside now serves as the Easton town offices.
Personal.
Following the sudden death of her husband, G.O.P. leaders requested that Mary become a candidate to the 14th district office of representative in Congress. She declined the offer, citing her love of North Easton and her family and desire to remain devoted to local organizations.

Early life.
Valee Taylor grew up on Chicago's South Side, living in the Robert Taylor Homes and moving repeatedly once they were demolished. Valee has said his mother exposed him to musicians such as Erykah Badu, Sade, Jill Scott all at an early age. To this day, he still references the artists showed to him at a young age as heavily influential on his current music. Taylor was well trained as an auto mechanic and made money by working on people's automobiles from his mothers garage.
Throughout his schooling, he had repeated issues with anger and his outbursts led to him being kicked out of numerous schools. The rapper cites Cash Money, and Project Pat as early hip hop influences.
Taylor says he decided to make music on a whim while living in the South Side of Chicago. He says he was on his way to purchase a video game system, but on the way decided to go to Guitar Center instead. He purchased the necessary equipment to start making beats and shortly after he began rapping over them

Valee's first official commercial project was, "GOOD Job, You Found Me" EP, which was released in March 2018, and was executive produced by Kanye West. This EP received minimal attention from the mainstream, however Pitchfork reviewed the project and gave it a score of 7.4/10.
In 2019, he released a surprise EP, "Runnin Rich," which included features from G Herbo, King Louie, and Vic Mensa.

Haleʻākala

Haleākala, later renamed Aikupika, and then the Arlington Hotel, was a historic structure in Honolulu, Hawaii, which was the home of various prominent Hawaiians, and later became a hotel, and the initial headquarters of the American military forces involved in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii.
The two-story pink coral house was built in Honolulu, on King Street, around the 1850s by Hawaiian high chief Pākī, who initially lived there with his wife Kōnia and their hānai daughter, Lydia Pākī, the natural daughter of Keohokalole and Kapaakea. The house was called Haleākala, sometimes translated as "House of the Sun" (Haleakalā), but probably meant "Pink House" after the coral rock from which the house was constructed. Pākī built the house himself, replacing the original grass hut complex of the same name at the same site, financed by the sale of Mākaha Valley. It would later become one of the primary residences of his daughter Bernice Pauahi Bishop, and her husband, Charles Reed Bishop. Duke Kahanamoku was also born in Haleʻākala while Bishop lived there. The house was later called Aikupika (Egypt). Later still, it became the Arlington Hotel.
At the time of the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in January 1893, United States Navy Lieutenant Lucien Young commanded a detachment from the "USS Boston" which mustered at "Camp Boston", initially established at the Arlington Hotel. The building was purchased at auction in 1900 and demolished to make way for a more modern housing development.

George Washington Memorial Building

The George Washington Memorial Building or George Washington Victory Memorial Building was a national building project supported by the "George Washington Memorial Association" which started in 1897 with a building project designed in 1914. The goal was to build a "National University" in the memory of the George Washington as envisioned by him in his will. It was originally supported by Congress and personalities and U.S. presidents but failed due to a lack of funds. The donations gathered over the years were passed on to the George Washington University.
History.
George Washington's last will and testament.
On 9 July 1799, in Mount Vernon, George Washington wrote his last will and testament. In it, it is mentioned the following:
"That as it has always been a source of serious regret with me, to see the youth of these United States sent to foreign Countries for the purpose of Education, often before their minds were formed, or they had imbibed any adequate ideas of the happiness of their own; contracting, too frequently, not only habits of dissipation &amp; extravagence, but principles unfriendly to Republican Government and to the true &amp; genuine liberties of Mankind; which, thereafter are rarely overcome."
"I give and bequeath in perpetuity the fifty shares which I hold in the Potomac Company (under the aforesaid Acts of the Legislature of Virginia) towards the endowment of a UNIVERSITY to be established within the limits of the District of Columbia, under the auspices of the General Government, if that government should incline to extend a fostering hand towards it; and until such Seminary is established, and the funds arising on these shares shall be required for its support, my further Will &amp; desire is that the profit accruing therefrom shall, whenever the dividends are made, be laid out in purchasing Stock in the Bank of Columbia, or some other Bank, at the discretion of my Executors; or by the Treasurer of the United States for the time being under the direction of Congress; provided that Honourable body should Patronize the measure, and the Dividends proceeding from the purchase of such Stock is to be vested in more stock, and so on, until a sum adequate to the accomplishment of the object is obtained, of which I have not the smallest doubt, before many years passes away; even if no aid or encouraged is given by Legislative authority, or from any other source."
Proclamation.
Since about 1895, there had been a movement to build a National University dedicated to the first President of the United States, George Washington as the centennial of his death was approaching. His last will was an inspiration and essential component in the creation of the George Washington Memorial Association.
The George Washington Memorial Association.
History.
On April 8, 1897, was organized at a national level the George Washington Memorial Committee. It later became the George Washington Memorial Association (GWMA). Its purpose was:
"To promote a patriotic interest in the bequest made by the " Father of his Country " for the establishment of a National University, to be known as the University of the United States, for the higher learning, —an exclusively post graduate university,—that shall complete the American system of public education and lead in research and investigation. The committee proposes to raise in small contributions the sum of $250,000 for the erection of a building for educational purposes, the corner-stone of which shall be laid on or near the one hundredth anniversary of his bequest in this behalf."
It was organized as a national Executive Board aided by Executive Committees in each State and Territory. It was composed originally mainly of patriotic women from all over the United States. However, it was soon gaining support from other groups and became mixed.
Sponsorship efforts.
On December 14, 1897, the Executive Committee gathered at the Hotel Raleigh in Washington, D.C., for their first annual meeting to discuss the Memorial University Project. It was attended by several hundreds of people and several speakers were presenting for the duration of the meeting which lasted until December 17, 1897. During the four-day meeting, it was called for February 22, 1898 to be an "Offering Day" to the memory of George Washington to reach the $250,000 goal set then to build a "National University". It was hoped that a cornerstone of an administration building could be laid by December 14, 1899, the hundredth anniversary of Washington's death. However, this would not happen until 1921.
By 1915, the Executive Committee had Mrs. Susan Dimock as president of the Association. Under her leadership, the Association had been able to get the support of Former President William H. Taft and the support of 41 State Governors.
The Memorial.
Design.
The Administration Building was to be built on the land previously occupied by the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station on what was then known as "Armory Square". It was located between 6th Street NW and 7th Street NW crossing B Street NW. It was to have a conventional hall with a very large auditorium for 7,000 people and banquet hall for 600 people.
On March 4, 1913, Congress approved the construction of the George Washington Memorial Building on the land. It was to cost at least $2,000,000 to be paid for by the George Washington Memorial Association. It was to be of granite and be approved by the Commission of Fine Arts. It would have to include an auditorium of no less than 6,000 people. It would occupy the northern part of the Armory Square while a new Armory would be built on the south side, where the current Armory had been built in 1856. The following year, a design was presented by Tracy and Swartwout from New York.
Construction.
On November 14, 1921, the cornerstone was laid with President Warren G. Harding in attendance. The project got a significant amount of political and financial support. It morphed into both a memorial to George Washington and a monument to the Veterans of World War I. By 1924, the foundations and stairs were completed and fenced.
On March 2, 1923, it was announced that the foundations for the building were being excavated. At the time, it was expected that the building would be completed in three to four years with between $800,000 and $900,000 being already available. It would prove not to be the case.
Failure of the project.
A few years after the laying of the cornerstone, it became obvious that, while the Association had been able to collect over $500,000 nationwide, it would not be sufficient to reach the $2,500,000 needed to build the project. It was completely abandoned due to a lack of funding. The donations were to go to the George Washington University.
In 1937, Congress approved the re-appropriation of the land to be used to build the National Gallery of Art. On August 20, 1937, the white marble cornerstone was dug up from the site. It contained a small metal box which was handed over to John R. Pope, architect of the Gallery of Arts. He passed it on to A. K. Shipe who had been the attorney of the association. On the box itself, a large gold star was present. It was believed at the time to be the star marking the spot in the former train station where President James A. Garfield had been shot.
The Archives of the Association have been preserved by the Smithsonian Institution Archives. It contains the correspondence from 1890 to 1922 as well as many other documents.

Catherine Tait

Catherine Tait (born 1958) is a Canadian business executive who currently serves as the president and CEO of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. She succeeded Hubert Lacroix for the position in 2018 and is the first woman to head the organization.
Tait is also the chair of the Global Task Force for Public Media, an initiative of the Public Media Alliance launched in September 2019.
Education.
Catherine Tait holds a Bachelor of Arts in Literature and Philosophy degree from the University of Toronto, a Master of Science from Boston University, and a Diplôme d’Études Approfondies in Communications Theory from the University of Paris II Panthéon-Assas.
Career.
Media and culture industry.
Prior to joining CBC/Radio-Canada, Catherine Tait had worked in film and television production in Canada and the U.S. for more than three decades.
She served as Manager of Policy and Planning at Telefilm Canada in the 1980s, before going on to become Director and Cultural Attaché with the Canadian Cultural Centre in France from 1989 to 1991.
In Canada, Tait was President and COO of Salter Street Films from 1997 to 2001, producing such shows as the long-running CBC comedy "This Hour Has 22 Minutes".
In 2002, she and film producer Liz Manne co-founded New York–based Duopoly Inc., an independent film, television and digital content company. Tait served as President until 2018. She also co-founded digital content provider iThentic in 2006 and the Canadian broadcaster Hollywood Suite in 2010.
President and CEO, CBC/Radio-Canada.
Strategic directions.
Catherine Tait presented her vision for the public broadcaster in May 2019, with the unveiling of the Corporation’s new strategic plan, "Your Stories, Taken to Heart". The plan covers five priorities: global reach, digital, kids content, regions and diversity.
In a speech to the Montreal Chamber of Commerce, Tait described how taking Canada to the world was the “spearhead” of CBC/Radio-Canada’s strategic plan, in order to counter the competitive threat of the digital giants. Since being appointed Chair of the Global Task Force for Public Media in September 2019, Tait has signed collaboration agreements (co-development and content sharing) between CBC/Radio-Canada and other public broadcasters around the world, such as the ABC, the BBC, France Télévisions, ZDF and RTBF.
As part of the public broadcaster’s ongoing digital transformation, in September 2018, Tait announced a new streaming service, CBC Gem, at Content Canada, an industry event in collaboration with the Toronto International Film Festival. The service launched in December 2018. Under her leadership, two new audio apps were developed – CBC Listen and Radio-Canada OHdio – providing a one-stop destination for all the public broadcaster’s audio content (music, podcasts and radio shows). Both apps were launched in fall 2019.
At the international Kidscreen Summit in February 2019, Tait committed to expanding the public broadcaster’s kids content offering, especially on CBC Gem. During her tenure, the Corporation also launched two news services for kids 13 and under: CBC Kids News in 2018 and MAJ ("Mon actualité du jour") in 2019.
At the Banff World Media Festival in June 2019, Tait announced that she would ask the production companies with whom she does business to ensure that at least one key creative position – producer, director, writer, showrunner and lead performer – is held by members of visible minorities, Indigenous Peoples, persons with disabilities and members of the LGBTQ2+ community.
In an interview with CBC/Radio-Canada reporters in Saskatchewan, Tait said she wanted to move more production to regional centres, particularly for radio and digital. This strategic priority has resulted in CBC stepping up its pop-up bureau approach at locations such as Stanley Mission, Saskatchewan; Winkler and Morden, Manitoba; northeast Calgary; and the Tsuut’ina First Nation in Alberta. CBC has also increased production outside Toronto, with the national radio show "Cost of Living" and the podcast "West of Centre" both being produced out of Calgary. The public broadcaster’s French-language network, Radio-Canada, has added new videojournalists in Yellowknife and Iqaluit to cover the North, as well as a more mobile workforce at its Abitibi-Témiscamingue station.
Comparison of Netflix to colonialism.
Tait came under fire for the unparalleled comparison of Netflix to colonial imperialism in India and parts of Africa. She said "I was thinking about the British Empire and how, if you were there and you were the viceroy of India, you would feel that you were doing only good for the people of India. Or similar, if you were in French Africa, you would think, I’m educating them, I’m bringing their resources to the world, and I’m helping them. There was a time when cultural imperialism was absolutely accepted. Fast forward to what happens after imperialism and the damage that can do to local communities. So all I would say is, let us be mindful of how it is we as Canadians respond to global companies coming into our country."
TV critic, John Doyle, who is known for critiquing Canadian TV wrote about Tait's statements saying "CBC's problem is complacency not imperialism."
Tait's comments made American headlines with J.J. McCullough of The Washington Post writing a piece about the incident. McCullough pointed out an important fact about Canada's heavily government-regulated TV industry "Given the sensitivities of our time, one might assume the recent comments of Catherine Tait, president of the state-sponsored Canadian Broadcasting Corp., would provoke calls for her resignation. It is not every day, after all, that one spouts analogies as historically callous as hers." He continued saying, "The guardians of Canada’s domestic entertainment industry cannot handle this reality, however, which is why Tait’s use of an appallingly ignorant slur like “imperialism” to describe Canadians’ love of Disney, Netflix and HBO has caused barely a ripple. As the Globe and Mail report on the Tait comments noted, basically all of Canada's modern cultural-telecommunication regulatory regime “was built in part as a bulwark against American influence," and one presumably does not build bulwarks against the benign. Since bureaucrats like Tait cannot demagogue against the tastes of a public whose interests they imagine themselves to be serving, the phantom menace of an imperial America conspiring to conquer Canada must be created instead."

<doc id="57021186" url="?curid=57021186" title="SS Regulus">
SS Regulus

SS "Regulus" was a steamship registered in St. John's, Dominion of Newfoundland. She was lost, with all hands, on October 23, 1910 on the rocks known as Hayes' Reef in Leeward Cove (now known as Lower Cove), south of Motion Head, Petty Harbour-Maddox Cove, Newfoundland during a southeast gale. The gale was most probably the last remnants of the 1910 Cuba hurricane.
History.
Tyne Iron Shipbuilding Company built SS "Regulus" Willington Quay and launched her on 26 October 1878. She entered service with Stevens and Mawson, Newcastle. A. Harvey and Company of Newfoundland purchased her in 1897 and she served as a general cargo vessel servicing routes between Newfoundland and various ports along the northeast coast of North America.
SS "Regulus" had a reputation as being a "jinxed ship." In 1907 "Regulus" collided head-on with an iceberg off Bay Bulls resulting in severe damage. On July 15, 1910, just three months prior to her loss, "Regulus" collided with SS "Karema" southeast of Nantucket. She was en route from Bell Island to Philadelphia with a full load of iron ore when she crashed head on into the port side of "Karema". The collision resulted in severe damage to both vessels and had it not been for emergency repairs "Karema" would surely have been lost.
Loss.
On October 22, 1910 "Regulus" departed Bell Island, Newfoundland en route to Sydney, Nova Scotia, in ballast. At 2 pm that day A. Harvey and Company received a telegraph from Bay Bulls stating that "Regulus" tail shaft had broken and she was at anchor off Shoal Bay and requesting immediate assistance. Two tugs, "John Green" and "D.P. Ingraham", were immediately dispatched from St. John's to render assistance. was also in port and offered to assist but it was decided that the two tugs would be sufficient for the task.
After passing Cape Spear "John Green" encountered fog which grew denser as they made headway. When the tugs had reached the last reported location of "Regulus" a dense fog had blanketed the entire area with a strong southerly breeze blowing and seas beginning to get heavier. The tugs cruised around for hours searching for "Regulus" and it was not until 10 pm that evening that "John Green" sighted "Regulus" lights and came alongside. At this time three options were discussed: 1) The tug would take "Regulus" crew off the vessel and land them in Bay Bulls. 2) The crew would remain with "Regulus" and "John Green" would remain close by "Regulus" until daylight. 3) The tug would take "Regulus" under tow to St. John's. For unknown reasons option 3 was chosen and the crew set about to take "Regulus" under tow at near 10:30 pm. It took between one and a half to two hours to weigh "Regulus" anchor, why the anchor was not slipped remains a mystery. At approximately 1 am the tow commenced, by this time the wind had veered southeast and increased to gale force with heavy seas making. The tow proceeded at about , a pace such that both vessels made considerable leeway toward land which was spotted by the tugs crew off the port bow at about 2:30 am. The tug's crew immediately ported to avoid rocks resulting in the Hawser breaking. The crew of "John Green" then witnessed the lights of "Regulus" drifting leeward for approximately five minutes before disappearing.
At day break a search was started for survivors, however the seas were still heavy and by days end it was concluded that there were likely no survivors. The propeller of the vessel was spotted lodged in a cliff at Leeward Cove which confirmed "Regulus" foundered on Hayes Reef in Leeward Cove.
The fishermen and residents of nearby Petty Harbour-Maddox Cove immediately launched a recovery effort in an attempt to recover the bodies of the crew. At great peril they spent the next several days in the area in their open skiffs using traditional fishing jiggers to drag the bottom for bodies but were hampered by the heavy seas. At one point there were reportedly 20 skiffs on the scene. They also reported that "Regulus" boat davits were intact and the boats had been launched but debris found on the scene proved the boats had been smashed to pieces on the rocks.
The wreck of "Regulus" remained grounded and visible for the first couple of days but the heavy seas were taking their toll and the vessel was breaking up. "Regulus" eventually slipped below the surface. A diving team from HMS "Brilliant" located the wreck at a depth of in Leeward Cove across a subsurface gulch on a west to east heading with her bow to the east. Despite the efforts of the residents of Petty Harbour and the dive teams from HMS "Brilliant" no bodies were ever recovered from the wreck. The divers reported a severe and dangerous undertow which may have resulted in any bodies being dragged hundreds of meters out to sea.
Court of Marine Inquiry.
On November 16, 1910 a Court of Marine Inquiry was held at St. John's, Newfoundland with J.G. Conroy presiding. The final judgement of the inquiry laid blame for the disaster on the crew of the tug "John Green". The course steered by the tug was not a safe and proper course to clear Motion Head. To safely clear Motion Head, in such conditions, an east course should have been followed instead of the northeast by east course taken.

2018–19 Manchester United F.C. season

The 2018–19 season was Manchester United's 27th season in the Premier League and their 44th consecutive season in the top flight of English football. The season was the first since 2005–06 without club captain Michael Carrick, who retired after the 2017–18 season and joined the club's coaching staff. Assistant manager Rui Faria left the club at the conclusion of that season, with Carrick and Kieran McKenna replacing him as the club's first-team coaches.
A disappointing Premier League campaign saw the club finish in sixth place. United were also eliminated early in the EFL Cup, losing on penalties to Championship side Derby County in the third round. The club reached the quarter-final stage of both the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League, but were eliminated by Wolverhampton Wanderers and Barcelona respectively. This resulted in United's first consecutive trophyless seasons in 30 years. On 5 May 2019, following a draw at bottom-placed Huddersfield Town, United confirmed their place in the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League, making it the fourth time they had finished outside of the top four in the league since 2014.
On 18 December 2018, with just seven wins in the first 17 league games, manager José Mourinho was sacked. His last game, two days earlier, ended in a 3–1 defeat to Liverpool. The following day, former United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season, assisted by former coach Mike Phelan, who had left the club in 2013 following the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson. On 28 March 2019, Solskjær became full-time manager.
Pre-season and friendlies.
United preceded their 2018–19 campaign with a tour of the United States. The first three games were announced on 3 April 2018, with the opposition provided by Club América, San Jose Earthquakes and Liverpool. The club later announced that the tour would see them compete in the International Champions Cup. In the 2018 competition, United played against Milan at the StubHub Center in Carson, California, Liverpool at the Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Real Madrid at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Alexis Sánchez's arrival in the United States was delayed as he was not issued with a visa due to the 16-month suspended jail sentence he accepted in February for tax fraud during his time in Spain. The final pre-season game saw Manchester United play away to Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena on 5 August.
Premier League.
Matches.
The Premier League announced the fixtures for the 2018–19 season on 14 June 2018.
FA Cup.
As one of the 20 teams in the Premier League, Manchester United entered the FA Cup in the Third Round. The draw was made on 3 December 2018 and paired United with Reading, whom they had faced at the same stage two seasons earlier, when they won 4–0. United won the match 2–0; Juan Mata opened the scoring from the penalty spot after the video assistant referee ruled that Omar Richards had tripped Juan Mata in the penalty area, and another goal from Romelu Lukaku. 19-year-old winger Tahith Chong made his FA Cup debut, replacing Juan Mata in the 62nd minute. The draw for the Fourth Round was made on 7 January 2019 and United were drawn away to Arsenal; the last time the two sides had met in the FA Cup was in the Sixth Round of the 2014–15 season, when Arsenal won 2–1 at Old Trafford. This time Manchester United won 3–1; two goals in two minutes from former Arsenal forward Alexis Sánchez and Jesse Lingard put United 2–0 up with just over half an hour played, but Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang got one back for the Gunners shortly before half-time. Anthony Martial then came off the bench to seal the win for United with their third goal in the 82nd minute. The draw for the Fifth Round was made on 28 January 2019 and United were drawn away to Chelsea, whom they had faced in the final the previous season. Goals from Paul Pogba and Ander Herrera before half-time sealed a 2–0 win for United. They were then drawn away to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the quarter-finals. Goals from Raúl Jiménez and Diogo Jota gave Wolves a 2–1 win and a place in the semi-finals, with Marcus Rashford scoring a consolation goal for United in the 95th minute.
EFL Cup.
The draw for the third round of the EFL Cup was made on 30 August 2018, with Manchester United drawn at home to Derby County. United took the lead just three minutes in through Juan Mata, but an equaliser from Harry Wilson was followed by a red card for United keeper Romero. Marriot gave Derby the lead with five minutes to go, but Marouane Fellaini’s stoppage-time strike ensured penalties; however Derby won 8-7 on spot kicks. 
UEFA Champions League.
Group stage.
The draw for the group stage of the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League was made in Monaco on 30 August 2018.
Knockout phase.
The draw for the round of 16 was held on 17 December 2018, 12:00 CET, at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. After finishing second in their group and progressing to the round of 16, United were drawn against French champions Paris Saint-Germain in the first competitive meeting between the two sides. In the first leg at Old Trafford, goals from Presnel Kimpembe and Kylian Mbappé gave PSG a 2–0 lead to take back to the Parc des Princes. Needing to score three times to progress, Romelu Lukaku opened the scoring for United in the second minute of the second leg, before Juan Bernat restored PSG's two-goal aggregate lead less than 10 minutes later. Lukaku then scored again after half an hour, to bring United within a goal of the quarter-finals. Former Manchester United midfielder Ángel Di María had the ball in the back of the net early in the second half, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside, and Bernat hit the post late on after Mbappé had rounded David de Gea. In the 90th minute, referee Damir Skomina awarded United a penalty after using a VAR review to adjudge Kimpembe to have handled the ball in the penalty area. Marcus Rashford scored the spot-kick to make it 3–3 on aggregate and send United through to the quarter-finals on the away goals rule; this made them the first team in Champions League history to progress after losing by at least two goals at home in the first leg. Solskjær gave 17-year-old forward Mason Greenwood and 19-year-old winger Tahith Chong their European debuts, the former also playing his first senior game.
The draw for the quarter-finals was held on 15 March 2019, with United paired with Barcelona. Both United and Manchester City were originally drawn to play their home legs in the same week; as United finished lower in the league the previous season, their tie was reversed. The first leg was played at Old Trafford on 10 April 2019. Barcelona won 1–0 thanks to an own goal by Luke Shaw that was originally ruled out for offside; the decision was later overturned after a VAR review. The second leg was played at Camp Nou on 16 April, with two goals from Lionel Messi and another from former Liverpool forward Philippe Coutinho giving the Spanish side a 3–0 win on the night, 4–0 on aggregate.

Tayt

Tayt (also Tait, Tayet, and Taytet) was an Egyptian goddess. Some attest her husband was Neper while others state she was possibly the consort of Hedjhotep.
Textile goddess.
Tayt was the ancient Egyptian goddess of weaving, textiles, and to a lesser extent mummification. Her role was similar to Hedjhotep. The name Taytet originates from a word meaning garment. Because linen was the most common textile used in ancient Egypt, Tayt often wove or gave linen headdresses to deities and high-ranked officials. Statues of deities were clothed in high quality linen, the linen being considered divine due to its quality and attributes. Linen is derived from the stem of the flax plant: the younger the plant, the higher the grade and the higher the quality of the linen product. Due to linen's protective qualities, Tayt began being ascribed the role of a protective maternal figure. In Pyramid Text spell 738a, Tayt guards the pharaoh’s head, and helps him garner favor among other deities. In ancient Egypt, weaving was a popular commercial activity among workers’ women and royal women. Later, cotton was introduced to Egypt with the Roman Empire.
Funerary goddess.
Tayt became associated as a funerary goddess through the application of mummification bandages. Tayt is known as a goddess who “awakes in peace” and is associated with textile offerings to garner favor from deities. As a funerary goddess, she is depicted in the Fifth Section of the Book of Caverns, which describes Ra’s journey through the underworld and his dealings with the damned. She is shown greeting Ra and Osiris in the lower register. In the Pyramid Texts of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties, Tayt is characterized as a motherly figure wrapping bandages on a dead king. Mummy bandages came from the “land of Tait.”
Goddess of Tait.
Tayt was the tutelary goddess of the town Tait as referenced in one of the Pyramid Texts.

MESS (festival)

The MESS International Theatre Festival (MESS) is a theatre festival that takes place annually in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is the oldest living theatre festival in the Balkans, programming international experimental performances and emerging artists. MESS was the largest theatre festival in the Former Yugoslavia and was named one of Living Theatre's international showcases in 1974. It survived the Siege of Sarajevo, during which it hosted directors such as Susan Sontag and Peter Schumann. It organized the first edition of the Sarajevo Film Festival in 1993 and still acts as a collective board member today. Today it is the largest theatre festival in Bosnia and Herzegovina and one of the largest in South-Eastern Europe. In 2009 it expanded its activities to the city of Zenica, which now hosts parts of the regional program.
History.
The festival was founded in 1960 under the name "Festival malih i eksperimentalnih scena Jugoslavije" (Festival of small and experimental scenes of Yugoslavia). It was founded on the initiative of Yugoslavian theatre director, Jurislav Korenić. It was originally conceived as an annual gathering of the country's professional theatre companies with the goal of presenting the best experimental theatre pieces of the previous year. The specificity of the concept quickly garnered a wider audience and secured visits from international experimental theatre companies, such as Living Theater from New York City, that named the festival one of its four major annual show-piece platforms.
With the start of the Bosnian war in 1992 the festival's run was halted, only for it to be renamed and rebranded by a directorate of Bosnian artists and intellectuals, headed by theatre director Haris Pašović, with the desire to artistically resist the Siege of Sarajevo. Furthermore, the festival organized the first edition of the Sarajevo Film Festival in 1993 under the working title "Poslije kraja svijeta" (After the end of the world). During this period in time the festival produced numerous pieces by theatre directors such as Susan Sontag and Peter Schumann, who entered the besieged city to take part in the artistic resistance against the war. With the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords the festival was taken over by a team of young theatre professionals headed by newly-named manager Dino Mustafić. The first post-war edition of the festival hosted directors such as Giorgio Strehler, Frank Castorf and Peter Schumann.
In 2008 the festival changed its original format by introducing a handful of new programs. The "Mittel Europe MESS" program is designed to showcase the most interesting theatre pieces from the Former Yugoslavia and the wider South-Eastern European region. The "World MESS" program hosts pieces from Africa, Asia and Latin America, while the "Future MESS" program cultivates the original concept of the festival by showcasing the most experimental and subversive productions from across the globe. Furthermore, a children's program has also been established under the name "Children MESS".
Theatre directors that have taken part in the festival include: Peter Brook, Giorgio Strehler, Robert Wilson, Peter Schumann, Eugenio Barba, Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker, Eimuntas Nekrošius, Alvis Hermanis, Olivier Py, Mark Tompkins, Wlodzimierz Staniewski, Simon McBurney, Christoph Marthaler, Frank Castorf, Thomas Ostermeier, Andriy Zholdak, Rimas Tuminas, Emma Dante, Rodrigo Garcia, Heiner Goebbels Romeo Castellucci, Wim Vandekeybus, Forced Entertainment, Laert Vasili.
Memory Modul.
The Memory Modul is a cultural project initiated by the festival in 1995 with the goal of preserving the memory of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The project has worked to keep hundreds of documents, photographs and videos from being forgotten and has offered audiences new and creative works which are related to the Bosnian war as well as other armed conflicts across the world. Furthermore, the Memory Modul has produced a handful of documentary films, including "Greta" by Haris Pašović, which documented the life of Greta Ferušić, a retired professor of architecture at the University of Sarajevo and survivor of Auschwitz and the Siege of Sarajevo.

Dancing in Berlin

"Dancing in Berlin" is a song by American band Berlin, released in 1984 as the third single from their third studio album "Love Life". It was written by John Crawford and produced by Giorgio Moroder and Richie Zito. It reached No. 12 in New Zealand and No. 39 in Australia.
Critical reception.
Upon release, "Billboard" included the song as a recommended single under the "Pop" section. "The Absolute Sound" described the song as one of the best from "Love Life". In a retrospective review of the album, Mike DeGagne of AllMusic commented that the song "emulates the same streamline formula of sharp keyboards and an animated dance pace" of "No More Words".

Helicobacter typhlonius

"Helicobacter typhlonius" is a Gram-negative bacterium and opportunistic pathogen found in the genus "Helicobacter". Only 35 known species are in this genus, which was described in 1982. "H. typhlonius" has a small number of close relatives, including "Helicobacter muridarum, Helicobacter trogontum", and "Helicobacter hepaticus", with the latter being the closest relative and much more prevalent.
Taxonomy.
"H.typhlonius" is one of 35 known species of "Helicobacter". It was previously named "Helicobacter" sp. strain MIT 97-6910 by Fox "et al.", but was changed to its current name by Franklin "et al." after discovering a genetically and morphologically identical organism that causes proliferative typhlocolitis, also known as irritable bowel disease. Some close relatives of "H. typhlonius" include "H. muridarum, H. trogontum, H. hepaticus," and "H. pylori".
Morphology and physiology.
"H. typhlonius" is motile due to its single sheathed flagellum. It has a spiral morphology, and its size is 0.3 by 2.0 to 3.0 μm. It is capable of ammonia assimilation, urea production, and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate biosynthesis. "H. typhlonius" is also urease-negative, which is known to assist in survival and proliferation of microbes in acidic gastric environments. Additionally, it can only grow in microaerobic conditions (a very small amount of oxygen), not in aerobic or anaerobic conditions.
Discovery.
"H. typhlonius" was isolated from the feces of immunocompromised mice by James G. Fox and Craig L. Franklin in two separate laboratories in 1999. The mice suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, which was caused by "H. typhlonius", but the mechanism of the infection was unknown. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to copy the DNA sequence of the bacteria to be examined. PCR was an ideal method, due to the unique intervening genome sequence that is easily recognized by PCR. The sequences were then analyzed using the Sequence Analysis Software Package (Wisconsin Package, version 10.0; Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison Wis.). The biochemical results of PCR tests, as well as phenotypic test results of all other 32 known species of "Helicobacter", were compared to the results given by the newly isolated species. After observing the results and declaring "H. typhlonius" a new species of "Helicobacter", a new phylogenetic tree for the genus "Helicobacter" was created.
Genomics.
The full genome was determined using single-molecule, real-time sequencing in 2015 by Frank "et al." Using hierarchical genome assembly process, the sequences were assembled into a single long read.
The genome of "H. typhlonius" is 1,920,000 base pairs in length, with 2,117 protein-coding genes and 43 RNA genes with a GC-content of 38.8%. Compared to other members of the genus "Helicobacter" such as "H. hepaticus" and "H. pylori", "H. typhlonius" has a larger genome. Furthermore, "H. typhlonius" has a GC-content that is similar to "H. hepaticus". While roughly 75% of protein-coding genes were shared between "H. hepaticus" and "H. typhlonius", 468 unique protein-coding genes were identified in "H. typhlonius", which comprise about 2% of its entire genome.
Additionally, the genome contains a distinct pathogenicity island with a lower GC-content and flanked by repeats. This island is around 650,000 base pairs and compromises 75 protein-coding genes that include a type IV secretion system that is responsible for secreting toxins to assist in virulence.
Metabolism.
"H. typhlonius" is a microaerophile capable of oxidative phosphorylation using oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor.
In this species, fermentation of pyruvate and Acetyl-CoA to acetate is possible in the absence of oxygen. Additionally, carbohydrate breakdown includes both sucrose and mannose and amino-acid degradation includes citrulline, aspartate, glutamate, and glutamine. "H. typhlonius" is also capable of arginine biosynthesis through the urea cycle.
Ecology.
"H. typhlonius" can grow at 37 and 42°C, but it cannot be grown at 25°C or in the presence of 1.5% sodium chloride. The typical spiral morphology can also change into cocci when grown in the presence of 1% glycine, but growth rate remains the same. Growth optima of "H. typhlonius" occur in microaerobic conditions. It is typically found in the gastrointestinal tract of immunodeficient rodents and humans, and is characterized by a 166-base-pair intervening sequence in its 16s rRNA, which has been previously detected by 16s rRNA gene sequence analysis.
Significance.
"H. typhlonius" is thought to cause irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in both humans and animals, so it is used to study IBS pathogenesis and treatment. Along with this, some research has linked "H. typhlonius" with the regulation of intestinal tumors. From studying "Apc"-mutant mice, researchers were able to use PCR amplification to observe certain segments of DNA and narrow down the cause to two possible bacterial species: "Akkermansia muciniphila" and "H. typhlonius". A positive correlation was established between the prevalence of these bacteria and tumor size. t "H. typhlonius" has also been found to cause typhlocolitis in immunocompromised mice. Typhlocolitis is characterized by inflammation and necrosis of the mucosal lining in the intestinal tract, specifically cecal, colonic, and small intestinal tissues.

Sturnira hondurensis

Sturnira honurensis is a species of bat found in Central America. Previously, it was considered a subspecies of the highland yellow-shouldered bat, but it has been considered distinct since 2010.
Taxonomy and etymology.
It was described as a new species in 1940 by George G. Goodwin.
Since its discovery, it has sometimes been considered a subspecies of the highland yellow-shouldered bat, "Sturnira ludovici".
However, a 2010 study showed that while it is closely related to the highland yellow-shouldered bat, it is distinct enough to be considered its own species.
Its species name "hondurensis" is Latin for "belonging to Honduras."
Goodwin likely chose "hondurensis" because the holotype for the species was collected near San José, Honduras.
Description.
It tragi are long and sickle-shaped.
Biology and ecology.
It is nocturnal, foraging for food at night and sleeping during the day.
In the day, it roosts in sheltered places such as trees.
Tree species used for roosting include the American sweetgum, "Quercus sartorii", Jamaican nettletree, and the elephant-ear tree.
It is frugivorous.
It mostly feeds on fruits from the family Solanaceae.
Conservation.
It is currently evaluated as least concern by the IUCN.

2018 Connecticut Sun season

The 2018 WNBA season is the 20th season for the Connecticut Sun franchise of the WNBA. It is also the 16th season for the franchise in Connecticut. The season tipped off on May 13.
The Sun got off to a strong start, going 3–0 in May. All three wins were at home. In June, the Sun started strong, winning their first 4 of 5. However, they lost 5 of their next 7 games to finish 6–6 on the month. That skid included a 1–4 road trip, where all losses came 4 of eventual top 5 playoff teams. Their up and down season continued into July, where the Sun were 5–6. July started with another tough road trip where the Sun went 1–3. From there the Sun couldn't get a streak going; losing 2 then winning 2 then losing 2 again. The Sun surged in August posting a 7–1 record, including going 6–0 at home. Their only loss came on the road to Chicago. The Sun finished 21–13, which earned them the 4th seed in the 2018 WNBA Playoffs. Their playoff run fell short when they lost at home in the second round 86–96. This was the Sun's only playoff game, as they earned a first round bye.

Murad Olegovich Musayev (; born 10 November 1983) is a Russian football coach of Avar origin. 
Club career.
He led the Under-19 team of FC Krasnodar to the 2017–18 UEFA Youth League knockout phase, where they were eliminated by Real Madrid only in a shootout in front of the sold-out Krasnodar Stadium.
On 3 April 2018, following the firing of Igor Shalimov, he was appointed the caretaker manager of FC Krasnodar. After his caretaking spell was over in early May, he could not be registered as manager with the Russian Premier League due to lack of UEFA Pro Licence (Musayev only held UEFA B Licence at the time), so Oleg Fomenko was formally registered with the league as head coach and Musayev as his senior assistant coach, but Musayev de facto continued to manage the team. He received his UEFA A Licence later in 2018, but that still didn't make him eligible to be registered as the head coach. Before the 2019–20 season, Fomenko moved to FC Krasnodar-2 and Sergey Matveyev was hired by FC Krasnodar as head coach. Musayev passed his UEFA Pro Licence exam in the summer of 2020 and was officially registered with the league as Krasnodar's manager on 20 June 2020. He led Krasnodar to their first qualification to the group stage of the UEFA Champions League in the 2020–21 season. He resigned from Krasnodar on 3 April 2021 following a string of bad results after 2020–21 season was resumed after a winter break, including a biggest ever club defeat (1–6 to FC Spartak Moscow away) and a biggest ever home loss (0–5 to FC Akhmat Grozny).

<doc id="57021483" url="?curid=57021483" title="Distributed-element circuit">
Distributed-element circuit

Distributed-element circuits are electrical circuits composed of lengths of transmission lines or other distributed components. These circuits perform the same functions as conventional circuits composed of passive components, such as capacitors, inductors, and transformers. They are used mostly at microwave frequencies, where conventional components are difficult (or impossible) to implement.
Conventional circuits consist of individual components manufactured separately then connected together with a conducting medium. Distributed-element circuits are built by forming the medium itself into specific patterns. A major advantage of distributed-element circuits is that they can be produced cheaply as a printed circuit board for consumer products, such as satellite television. They are also made in coaxial and waveguide formats for applications such as radar, satellite communication, and microwave links.
A phenomenon commonly used in distributed-element circuits is that a length of transmission line can be made to behave as a resonator. Distributed-element components which do this include stubs, coupled lines, and cascaded lines. Circuits built from these components include filters, power dividers, directional couplers, and circulators.
Distributed-element circuits were studied during the 1920s and 1930s but did not become important until World War II, when they were used in radar. After the war their use was limited to military, space, and broadcasting infrastructure, but improvements in materials science in the field soon led to broader applications. They can now be found in domestic products such as satellite dishes and mobile phones.
Circuit modelling.
Distributed-element circuits are designed with the distributed-element model, an alternative to the lumped-element model in which the passive electrical elements of electrical resistance, capacitance and inductance are assumed to be "lumped" at one point in space in a resistor, capacitor or inductor, respectively. The distributed-element model is used when this assumption no longer holds, and these properties are considered to be distributed in space. The assumption breaks down when there is significant time for electromagnetic waves to travel from one terminal of a component to the other; "significant", in this context, implies enough time for a noticeable phase change. The amount of phase change is dependent on the wave's frequency (and inversely dependent on wavelength). A common rule of thumb amongst engineers is to change from the lumped to the distributed model when distances involved are more than one-tenth of a wavelength (a 36° phase change). The lumped model completely fails at one-quarter wavelength (a 90° phase change), with not only the value, but the nature of the component not being as predicted. Due to this dependence on wavelength, the distributed-element model is used mostly at higher frequencies; at low frequencies, distributed-element components are too bulky. Distributed designs are feasible above , and are the technology of choice at microwave frequencies above .
There is no clear-cut demarcation in the frequency at which these models should be used. Although the changeover is usually somewhere in the 100-to- range, the technological scale is also significant; miniaturised circuits can use the lumped model at a higher frequency. Printed circuit boards (PCBs) using through-hole technology are larger than equivalent designs using surface-mount technology. Hybrid integrated circuits are smaller than PCB technologies, and monolithic integrated circuits are smaller than both. Integrated circuits can use lumped designs at higher frequencies than printed circuits, and this is done in some radio frequency integrated circuits. This choice is particularly significant for hand-held devices, because lumped-element designs generally result in a smaller product.
Construction with transmission lines.
The overwhelming majority of distributed-element circuits are composed of lengths of transmission line, a particularly simple form to model. The cross-sectional dimensions of the line are unvarying along its length, and are small compared to the signal wavelength; thus, only distribution along the length of the line need be considered. Such an element of a distributed circuit is entirely characterised by its length and characteristic impedance. A further simplification occurs in commensurate line circuits, where all the elements are the same length. With commensurate circuits, a lumped circuit design prototype consisting of capacitors and inductors can be directly converted into a distributed circuit with a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of each circuit.
Commensurate line circuits are important because a design theory for producing them exists; no general theory exists for circuits consisting of arbitrary lengths of transmission line (or any arbitrary shapes). Although an arbitrary shape can be analysed with Maxwell's equations to determine its behaviour, finding useful structures is a matter of trial and error or guesswork.
An important difference between distributed-element circuits and lumped-element circuits is that the frequency response of a distributed circuit periodically repeats as shown in the Chebyshev filter example; the equivalent lumped circuit does not. This is a result of the transfer function of lumped forms being a rational function of complex frequency; distributed forms are an irrational function. Another difference is that cascade-connected lengths of line introduce a fixed delay at all frequencies (assuming an ideal line). There is no equivalent in lumped circuits for a fixed delay, although an approximation could be constructed for a limited frequency range.
Advantages and disadvantages.
Distributed-element circuits are cheap and easy to manufacture in some formats, but take up more space than lumped-element circuits. This is problematic in mobile devices (especially hand-held ones), where space is at a premium. If the operating frequencies are not too high, the designer may miniaturise components rather than switching to distributed elements. However, parasitic elements and resistive losses in lumped components are greater with increasing frequency as a proportion of the nominal value of the lumped-element impedance. In some cases, designers may choose a distributed-element design (even if lumped components are available at that frequency) to benefit from improved quality. Distributed-element designs tend to have greater power-handling capability; with a lumped component, all the energy passed by a circuit is concentrated in a small volume.
Media.
Paired conductors.
Several types of transmission line exist, and any of them can be used to construct distributed-element circuits. The oldest (and still most widely used) is a pair of conductors; its most common form is twisted pair, used for telephone lines and Internet connections. It is not often used for distributed-element circuits because the frequencies used are lower than the point where distributed-element designs become advantageous. However, designers frequently begin with a lumped-element design and convert it to an open-wire distributed-element design. Open wire is a pair of parallel uninsulated conductors used, for instance, for telephone lines on telegraph poles. The designer does not usually intend to implement the circuit in this form; it is an intermediate step in the design process. Distributed-element designs with conductor pairs are limited to a few specialised uses, such as Lecher lines and the twin-lead used for antenna feed lines.
Coaxial.
Coaxial line, a centre conductor surrounded by an insulated shielding conductor, is widely used for interconnecting units of microwave equipment and for longer-distance transmissions. Although coaxial distributed-element devices were commonly manufactured during the second half of the 20th century, they have been replaced in many applications by planar forms due to cost and size considerations. Air-dielectric coaxial line is used for low-loss and high-power applications. Distributed-element circuits in other media still commonly transition to coaxial connectors at the circuit ports for interconnection purposes.
Planar.
The majority of modern distributed-element circuits use planar transmission lines, especially those in mass-produced consumer items. There are several forms of planar line, but the kind known as microstrip is the most common. It can be manufactured by the same process as printed circuit boards and hence is cheap to make. It also lends itself to integration with lumped circuits on the same board. Other forms of printed planar lines include stripline, finline and many variations. Planar lines can also be used in monolithic microwave integrated circuits, where they are integral to the device chip.
Waveguide.
Many distributed-element designs can be directly implemented in waveguide. However, there is an additional complication with waveguides in that multiple modes are possible. These sometimes exist simultaneously, and this situation has no analogy in conducting lines. Waveguides have the advantages of lower loss and higher quality resonators over conducting lines, but their relative expense and bulk means that microstrip is often preferred. Waveguide mostly finds uses in high-end products, such as high-power military radars and the upper microwave bands (where planar formats are too lossy). Waveguide becomes bulkier with lower frequency, which militates against its use on the lower bands.
Mechanical.
In a few specialist applications, such as the mechanical filters in high-end radio transmitters (marine, military, amateur radio), electronic circuits can be implemented as mechanical components; this is done largely because of the high quality of the mechanical resonators. They are used in the radio frequency band (below microwave frequencies), where waveguides might otherwise be used. Mechanical circuits can also be implemented, in whole or in part, as distributed-element circuits. The frequency at which the transition to distributed-element design becomes feasible (or necessary) is much lower with mechanical circuits. This is because the speed at which signals travel through mechanical media is much lower than the speed of electrical signals.
Circuit components.
There are several structures that are repeatedly used in distributed-element circuits. Some of the common ones are described below.
Stub.
A stub is a short length of line that branches to the side of a main line. The end of the stub is often left open- or short-circuited, but may also be terminated with a lumped component. A stub can be used on its own (for instance, for impedance matching), or several of them can be used together in a more complex circuit such as a filter. A stub can be designed as the equivalent of a lumped capacitor, inductor, or resonator.
Departures from constructing with uniform transmission lines in distributed-element circuits are rare. One such departure that is widely used is the radial stub, which is shaped like a sector of a circle. They are often used in pairs, one on either side of the main transmission line. Such pairs are called butterfly or bowtie stubs.
Coupled lines.
Coupled lines are two transmission lines between which there is some electromagnetic coupling. The coupling can be direct or indirect. In indirect coupling, the two lines are run closely together for a distance with no screening between them. The strength of the coupling depends on the distance between the lines and the cross-section presented to the other line. In direct coupling, branch lines directly connect the two main lines together at intervals.
Coupled lines are a common method of constructing power dividers and directional couplers. Another property of coupled lines is that they act as a pair of coupled resonators. This property is used in many distributed-element filters.
Cascaded lines.
Cascaded lines are lengths of transmission line where the output of one line is connected to the input of the next. Multiple cascaded lines of different characteristic impedances can be used to construct a filter or a wide-band impedance matching network. This is called a stepped impedance structure. A single, cascaded line one-quarter wavelength long forms a quarter-wave impedance transformer. This has the useful property of transforming any impedance network into its dual; in this role, it is called an impedance inverter. This structure can be used in filters to implement a lumped-element prototype in ladder topology as a distributed-element circuit. The quarter-wave transformers are alternated with a distributed-element resonator to achieve this. However, this is now a dated design; more compact inverters, such as the impedance step, are used instead. An impedance step is the discontinuity formed at the junction of two cascaded transmission lines with different characteristic impedances.
Cavity resonator.
A cavity resonator is an empty (or sometimes dielectric-filled) space surrounded by conducting walls. Apertures in the walls couple the resonator to the rest of the circuit. Resonance occurs due to electromagnetic waves reflected back and forth from the cavity walls setting up standing waves. Cavity resonators can be used in many media, but are most naturally formed in waveguide from the already existing metal walls of the guide.
Dielectric resonator.
A dielectric resonator is a piece of dielectric material exposed to electromagnetic waves. It is most often in the form of a cylinder or thick disc. Although cavity resonators can be filled with dielectric, the essential difference is that in cavity resonators the electromagnetic field is entirely contained within the cavity walls. A dielectric resonator has some field in the surrounding space. This can lead to undesirable coupling with other components. The major advantage of dielectric resonators is that they are considerably smaller than the equivalent air-filled cavity.
Helical resonator.
A helical resonator is a helix of wire in a cavity; one end is unconnected, and the other is bonded to the cavity wall. Although they are superficially similar to lumped inductors, helical resonators are distributed-element components and are used in the VHF and lower UHF bands.
Fractals.
The use of fractal-like curves as a circuit component is an emerging field in distributed-element circuits. Fractals have been used to make resonators for filters and antennae. One of the benefits of using fractals is their space-filling property, making them smaller than other designs. Other advantages include the ability to produce wide-band and multi-band designs, good in-band performance, and good out-of-band rejection. In practice, a true fractal cannot be made because at each fractal iteration the manufacturing tolerances become tighter and are eventually greater than the construction method can achieve. However, after a small number of iterations, the performance is close to that of a true fractal. These may be called "pre-fractals" or "finite-order fractals" where it is necessary to distinguish from a true fractal.
Fractals that have been used as a circuit component include the Koch snowflake, Minkowski island, Sierpiński curve, Hilbert curve, and Peano curve. The first three are closed curves, suitable for patch antennae. The latter two are open curves with terminations on opposite sides of the fractal. This makes them suitable for use where a connection in cascade is required.
Taper.
A taper is a transmission line with a gradual change in cross-section. It can be considered the limiting case of the stepped impedance structure with an infinite number of steps. Tapers are a simple way of joining two transmission lines of different characteristic impedances. Using tapers greatly reduces the mismatch effects that a direct join would cause. If the change in cross-section is not too great, no other matching circuitry may be needed. Tapers can provide transitions between lines in different media, especially different forms of planar media. Tapers commonly change shape linearly, but a variety of other profiles may be used. The profile that achieves a specified match in the shortest length is known as a Klopfenstein taper and is based on the Chebychev filter design.
Tapers can be used to match a transmission line to an antenna. In some designs, such as the horn antenna and Vivaldi antenna, the taper is itself the antenna. Horn antennae, like other tapers, are often linear, but the best match is obtained with an exponential curve. The Vivaldi antenna is a flat (slot) version of the exponential taper.
Distributed resistance.
Resistive elements are generally not useful in a distributed-element circuit. However, distributed resistors may be used in attenuators and line terminations. In planar media they can be implemented as a meandering line of high-resistance material, or as a deposited patch of thin-film or thick-film material. In waveguide, a card of microwave absorbent material can be inserted into the waveguide.
Circuit blocks.
Filters and impedance matching.
Filters are a large percentage of circuits constructed with distributed elements. A wide range of structures are used for constructing them, including stubs, coupled lines and cascaded lines. Variations include interdigital filters, combline filters and hairpin filters. More-recent developments include fractal filters. Many filters are constructed in conjunction with dielectric resonators.
As with lumped-element filters, the more elements used, the closer the filter comes to an ideal response; the structure can become quite complex. For simple, narrow-band requirements, a single resonator may suffice (such as a stub or spurline filter).
Impedance matching for narrow-band applications is frequently achieved with a single matching stub. However, for wide-band applications the impedance-matching network assumes a filter-like design. The designer prescribes a required frequency response, and designs a filter with that response. The only difference from a standard filter design is that the filter's source and load impedances differ.
Power dividers, combiners and directional couplers.
A directional coupler is a four-port device which couples power flowing in one direction from one path to another. Two of the ports are the input and output ports of the main line. A portion of the power entering the input port is coupled to a third port, known as the "coupled port". None of the power entering the input port is coupled to the fourth port, usually known as the "isolated port". For power flowing in the reverse direction and entering the output port, a reciprocal situation occurs; some power is coupled to the isolated port, but none is coupled to the coupled port.
A power divider is often constructed as a directional coupler, with the isolated port permanently terminated in a matched load (making it effectively a three-port device). There is no essential difference between the two devices. The term "directional coupler" is usually used when the coupling factor (the proportion of power reaching the coupled port) is low, and "power divider" when the coupling factor is high. A power combiner is simply a power splitter used in reverse. In distributed-element implementations using coupled lines, indirectly coupled lines are more suitable for low-coupling directional couplers; directly coupled branch line couplers are more suitable for high-coupling power dividers.
Distributed-element designs rely on an element length of one-quarter wavelength (or some other length); this will hold true at only one frequency. Simple designs, therefore, have a limited bandwidth over which they will work successfully. Like impedance matching networks, a wide-band design requires multiple sections and the design begins to resemble a filter.
Hybrids.
A directional coupler which splits power equally between the output and coupled ports (a coupler) is called a "hybrid". Although "hybrid" originally referred to a hybrid transformer (a lumped device used in telephones), it now has a broader meaning. A widely used distributed-element hybrid which does not use coupled lines is the "hybrid ring" or rat-race coupler. Each of its four ports is connected to a ring of transmission line at a different point. Waves travel in opposite directions around the ring, setting up standing waves. At some points on the ring, destructive interference results in a null; no power will leave a port set at that point. At other points, constructive interference maximises the power transferred.
Another use for a hybrid coupler is to produce the sum and difference of two signals. In the illustration, two input signals are fed into the ports marked 1 and 2. The sum of the two signals appears at the port marked Σ, and the difference at the port marked Δ. In addition to their uses as couplers and power dividers, directional couplers can be used in balanced mixers, frequency discriminators, attenuators, phase shifters, and antenna array feed networks.
Circulators.
A circulator is usually a three- or four-port device in which power entering one port is transferred to the next port in rotation, as if round a circle. Power can flow in only one direction around the circle (clockwise or anticlockwise), and no power is transferred to any of the other ports. Most distributed-element circulators are based on ferrite materials. Uses of circulators include as an isolator to protect a transmitter (or other equipment) from damage due to reflections from the antenna, and as a duplexer connecting the antenna, transmitter and receiver of a radio system.
An unusual application of a circulator is in a reflection amplifier, where the negative resistance of a Gunn diode is used to reflect back more power than it received. The circulator is used to direct the input and output power flows to separate ports.
Passive circuits, both lumped and distributed, are nearly always reciprocal; however, circulators are an exception. There are several equivalent ways to define or represent reciprocity. A convenient one for circuits at microwave frequencies (where distributed-element circuits are used) is in terms of their S-parameters. A reciprocal circuit will have an S-parameter matrix, ["S"], which is symmetric. From the definition of a circulator, it is clear that this will not be the case,
for an ideal three-port circulator, showing that circulators are non-reciprocal by definition. It follows that it is impossible to build a circulator from standard passive components (lumped or distributed). The presence of a ferrite, or some other non-reciprocal material or system, is essential for the device to work.
Active components.
Distributed elements are usually passive, but most applications will require active components in some role. A microwave hybrid integrated circuit uses distributed elements for many passive components, but active components (such as diodes, transistors, and some passive components) are discrete. The active components may be packaged, or they may be placed on the substrate in chip form without individual packaging to reduce size and eliminate packaging-induced parasitics.
Distributed amplifiers consist of a number of amplifying devices (usually FETs), with all their inputs connected via one transmission line and all their outputs via another transmission line. The lengths of the two lines must be equal between each transistor for the circuit to work correctly, and each transistor adds to the output of the amplifier. This is different from a conventional multistage amplifier, where the gain is multiplied by the gain of each stage. Although a distributed amplifier has lower gain than a conventional amplifier with the same number of transistors, it has significantly greater bandwidth. In a conventional amplifier, the bandwidth is reduced by each additional stage; in a distributed amplifier, the overall bandwidth is the same as the bandwidth of a single stage. Distributed amplifiers are used when a single large transistor (or a complex, multi-transistor amplifier) would be too large to treat as a lumped component; the linking transmission lines separate the individual transistors.
History.
Distributed-element modelling was first used in electrical network analysis by Oliver Heaviside in 1881. Heaviside used it to find a correct description of the behaviour of signals on the transatlantic telegraph cable. Transmission of early transatlantic telegraph had been difficult and slow due to dispersion, an effect which was not well understood at the time. Heaviside's analysis, now known as the telegrapher's equations, identified the problem and suggested methods for overcoming it. It remains the standard analysis of transmission lines.
Warren P. Mason was the first to investigate the possibility of distributed-element circuits, and filed a patent in 1927 for a coaxial filter designed by this method. Mason and Sykes published the definitive paper on the method in 1937. Mason was also the first to suggest a distributed-element acoustic filter in his 1927 doctoral thesis, and a distributed-element mechanical filter in a patent filed in 1941. Mason's work was concerned with the coaxial form and other conducting wires, although much of it could also be adapted for waveguide. The acoustic work had come first, and Mason's colleagues in the Bell Labs radio department asked him to assist with coaxial and waveguide filters.
Before World War II, there was little demand for distributed-element circuits; the frequencies used for radio transmissions were lower than the point at which distributed elements became advantageous. Lower frequencies had a greater range, a primary consideration for broadcast purposes. These frequencies require long antennae for efficient operation, and this led to work on higher-frequency systems. A key breakthrough was the 1940 introduction of the cavity magnetron which operated in the microwave band and resulted in radar equipment small enough to install in aircraft. A surge in distributed-element filter development followed, filters being an essential component of radars. The signal loss in coaxial components led to the first widespread use of waveguide, extending the filter technology from the coaxial domain into the waveguide domain.
The wartime work was mostly unpublished until after the war for security reasons, which made it difficult to ascertain who was responsible for each development. An important centre for this research was the MIT Radiation Laboratory (Rad Lab), but work was also done elsewhere in the US and Britain. The Rad Lab work was published by Fano and Lawson. Another wartime development was the hybrid ring. This work was carried out at Bell Labs, and was published after the war by W. A. Tyrrell. Tyrrell describes hybrid rings implemented in waveguide, and analyses them in terms of the well-known waveguide magic tee. Other researchers soon published coaxial versions of this device.
George Matthaei led a research group at Stanford Research Institute which included Leo Young and was responsible for many filter designs. Matthaei first described the interdigital filter and the combline filter. The group's work was published in a landmark 1964 book covering the state of distributed-element circuit design at that time, which remained a major reference work for many years.
Planar formats began to be used with the invention of stripline by Robert M. Barrett. Although stripline was another wartime invention, its details were not published until 1951. Microstrip, invented in 1952, became a commercial rival of stripline; however, planar formats did not start to become widely used in microwave applications until better dielectric materials became available for the substrates in the 1960s. Another structure which had to wait for better materials was the dielectric resonator. Its advantages (compact size and high quality) were first pointed out by R. D. Richtmeyer in 1939, but materials with good temperature stability were not developed until the 1970s. Dielectric resonator filters are now common in waveguide and transmission line filters.
Important theoretical developments included Paul I. Richards' commensurate line theory, which was published in 1948, and Kuroda's identities, a set of transforms which overcame some practical limitations of Richards theory, published by Kuroda in 1955. According to Nathan Cohen, the log-periodic antenna, invented by Raymond DuHamel and Dwight Isbell in 1957, should be considered the first fractal antenna. However, its self-similar nature, and hence its relation to fractals was missed at the time. It is still not usually classed as a fractal antenna. Cohen was the first to explicitly identify the class of fractal antennae after being inspired by a lecture of Benoit Mandelbrot in 1987, but he could not get a paper published until 1995.

African vulture trade

The African vulture trade involves the poaching, trafficking, and illegal sale of vultures and vulture parts for bushmeat and for ritual and religious use, like traditional medicines, in Sub-Saharan Africa. This illegal trade of vultures and vulture parts is contributing to a population crisis on the continent. In 2017, the IUCN Red List categorized 7 of Africa's 11 vulture species as globally endangered or critically endangered. Recent research suggests that 90% of vulture species declines in Africa may be due to a combination of poisoning and illegal wildlife trade for medicinal use and/or bushmeat. All trade of African vultures is illegal, as these birds are protected by international laws.
African vulture trade falls under the broader spectrum of wildlife trade, with both national and international trade occurring. Vultures are sometimes specifically targeted for bushmeat consumption or traditional belief use. Poachers also target vultures, even when they are not harvesting the vultures for bushmeat or belief use purposes. Since vultures circle over carcasses, they can be used as sentinels, alerting wildlife authorities of poaching events. Ivory poachers and rhino horn poachers have thus targeted vultures to reduce the likelihood of being caught.
Bushmeat.
Bushmeat is meat harvested from non-domesticated animals including mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. Poachers target vulture species in sub-Saharan Africa for bushmeat harvest and consumption. Poaching and harvest of vultures for market trade usually involves poisoning the birds by baiting livestock and wildlife carcasses with agrochemicals. This attracts the vultures to feed, as they are obligate scavengers. The birds eat the poisoned meat and die, making the harvest easy. However, the poisons the vultures ingest are passed along through the food chain which places the humans that consume these birds also at risk for poisoning. The two leading causes for vulture deaths are poisoning and trade in traditional medicine, these two causes make up 90% of reported deaths.
Southern Africa.
There is a scarcity in the literature regarding the use of vultures as bushmeat in Southern Africa. Mentions of bushmeat consumption in Southern Africa do exist in the literature, as families in the region are reported as saying in a study on the use of natural resources, that they consume bushmeat a few times a year. However the specific use of vultures for bushmeat is not often discussed. The existing literature points to the existence of wildlife ranches in South Africa that contribute to the local economy, privately owned game ranches and Transfrontier Conservation Areas as a possible contributors to this gap.
The literature also indicates that the region of Southern Africa is a hub for illegal wildlife trafficking and the illegal wildlife market. Birds are mentioned as one of the groups of animals most significantly impacted by the illegal wildlife trade. This indicates that while there is no specific mention of consumption of vultures as bushmeat, birds are still being moved throughout the region and consumption or use elsewhere is still a driver for the activity.
East Africa.
While other regions of Africa have higher incidence of poisoning for bushmeat consumption, the practice also exists in East Africa. Specific countries, such as Kenya have experienced high rates of bird deaths from poisoning related to bush meat trade, with over 3,000 deaths reported in a 10-month period. Countries in East Africa, such as Tanzania, have seen increased bushmeat consumption due to a need for protein and income. However, there is no specific data regarding the sale of vultures in Tanzania's markets.
The limited reporting of vultures used as bushmeat may indicate the minimal numbers of vultures sold for food or represent a lack of published research on this topic in East Africa. This is similar to the lack of documentation available in Southern Africa.
West Africa.
West Africa consists of the following 15 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo. Of these western countries, some have fairly stable vulture populations such as the Hooded Vultures of The Gambia and Guinea-Bissau. On the other hand, there are countries like Senegal which has regions that have faced 80% vulture decline in the last half century. The trade of vultures for bushmeat, as well as belief use, is the primary factor for the decline of vulture population in West Africa.
Like many other animals, vultures found in West Africa are threatened by human-wildlife conflict. A study done throughout the continent found that although vulture losses could be seen everywhere, the highest total loss per year were in West and East Africa. The killing of many species is an integral part of human livelihood in the region. Human pressures on bushmeat populations are growing more rapidly than national population statistics suggest. Over time the hunting of bushmeat has morphed from traditional subsistence to commercial trade. An increasing population and spread of urbanization has been thought to be one of the leading causes of increases in commercial bushmeat sales. Hunting bushmeat in West Africa is also an important part of the livelihood for many people who live there. It is also a big part of the culture in Central and West Africa because bushmeat is their most important source of protein. Important as this is for the humans who rely on the bushmeat, it puts the survival of many species of vultures found in West Africa at risk.
There are many impacts associated with the vulture bushmeat market. Some purchasers believe that vulture parts would help them be cured from any diseases or illness they are enduring. Impacts on the environment are also a result of bushmeat acquisition in West Africa. Specifically habitat disturbance, level of protection, hunting pressure, and distance to market have reduced forests throughout the region. The consumption of bushmeat has also affected the wildlife population, but has also raised deadly diseases known as the Ebola virus. Human life is another risk due to bushmeat being eaten when it is known to be a non dietary supplement of solid food. There is a link between education and income status that evaluates why consumers in Africa are choosing bushmeat specifically. There is no large scale regional effort to address the bushmeat problem in West Africa currently.
Liberia
In Liberia, when conducting the experiment to test out the theory of socio-economic factors for bushmeat consumption, it was found that monthly income, years of education, and literacy were all factors that led to the purchases. Due to the lack of knowledge and monetary funds, poor income families were forced to obtain the wild animal meat in order to feast and gain protein.
Central Africa.
Vultures in Central Africa are being used as bushmeat and the market for vulture meat is growing. Due to the great vulnerability of vultures increasing “prosecutions and hunting pressures” in Central Africa has led to a heavy decline of the vulture populations and increase of vulture bushmeat in Central African markets. Although vultures are used for a variety of reasons in Central Africa, most are used as bushmeat and sold at bushmeat markets. Most bushmeat markets sell large bodied vultures which are mainly killed by poison. In a study done in areas of Nigeria and Cameroon, it is estimated that more than 900,000 reptiles, birds, and mammals are sold each year which is approximately 12,000 tonnes of terrestrial vertebrates. 8.42 tonnes of that was bird bushmeat, and vultures made up most of that. Most of the vultures found in the study were being sold in rural areas of Cameroon. Hooded and large bodied vultures are some of the most sold raptors. Combined with Black kite they make up 41% of the raptor bushmeat market in West and Central Africa. In the bushmeat market, the most frequently traded species are those with scavenging behavior, generalist or savannah habitat use, and an afrotropical breeding range. Approximately half of the vultures sold at bushmeat markets are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List for threatened and endangered species.
Belief use.
Poachers also harvest vultures in sub-Saharan Africa to sell their parts to people for belief use practices, such as traditional medicine, African vudon, and witchcraft. As with bushmeat harvests, African vultures sold for belief use are usually hunted using poisoned baits. Therefore, when belief use practitioners consume the vulture or vulture parts as part of their activities, they also ingest the poisons used to kill the vulture.
Vultures in sub-Saharan Africa are known for their tremendous eyesight, and many believe their body parts can be used to see into the future. Some South African belief users inhale smoke from burned vulture brains to improve cognitive abilities or to improve their luck.
Southern Africa.
South Africa.
As it stands, a greater part of the literature addressing belief use in the southern region of Africa comes from South Africa. Many South Africans do not view traditional medicine as a secondary choice to Western medicine, but rather a better or parallel treatment for ailments that Western medicines do not adequately treat.
The use of vultures for traditional medicine is a prominent feature of some South African cultures, such as the Zulu people. In his study of muthi and its impacts on vultures, McKean explains some of the reasoning provided for vulture use. "Research confirms that vultures are used... for a range of purposes, but are believed to be most effective for providing clairvoyant powers, foresight, and increased intelligence". Approximately 160 vultures are sold per year in eastern South Africa alone, contributing to an estimated 59,000 consumption events of various vulture parts. The harvesting of vultures for the traditional medicine market on this scale significantly impacts vulture species population numbers. White-headed and Lappet-faced vultures could disappear entirely in approximately 27 years if drastic changes are not made to increase protective measures for these birds.
Lesotho.
Much like its neighboring country South Africa, in Lesotho, vultures are believed to have supernatural powers and to personify insight and power. In a study done by Beilis and Esterhuizen, parts used for belief use ranged from vulture eyes and hearts to feathers and bones. It was observed that wings and feathers were least popular while parts such as brains and eyes were more desirable to consumers. The parts sold by healers seemed to only be Cape Griffon vulture parts.
Only 11% of the 318 registered traditional healers in the capital of Lesotho sold vulture parts in 1998. Healers that were interviewed testified to the fact that they only used one vulture a year, which would translate to 35 vultures being killed in a year. But this does not bring into account unregistered healers or the high demand that exists during elections or significant events of that nature. Beilis and Esterhuizen found that if each healer used one more vulture, it would have the potential to disrupt the breeding process of vultures the country.
Zambia.
Though there exists a lack of knowledge on the current status of vulture populations in Zambia, very few occurrences of vulture poisoning have been recorded. Zambia's vultures are predominantly sited in protected areas and game management areas and are believed to be healthy. The populations that don't inhabit these areas are the ones that might be seeing a decline in populations. The known cases of vulture deaths in Zambia generally happen right outside of national parks and in South Luangwa National Park these deaths were linked to belief use of vultures. Many of these dead vultures are said to have their heads removed for use in rituals.
Zimbabwe.
In Zimbabwe, the Southern Ground-Hornbill's population has dropped significantly outside of designated protection areas, and is now a national concern. A study at a Zimbabwe market was conducted to evaluate the sale and use of the Southern Ground-Hornbill. 18% of the traders caught the Ground-Hornbills themselves, 18% acquired them opportunistically, and 64% are supplied by hunters. Seven main uses were expressed by market salesman: fighting or revenge, to eliminate bad spirits, protection, strength, achieving dreams or goals, preventing theft, and to bring ancestral spirits to young "inyangas", also known as herbalists.
East Africa.
Little is known regarding vulture belief use in Eastern Africa. It is unclear whether this dearth of information indicates limited use, or rather a lack of research conducted within the region. Scholars have called for increased examination, particularly within the countries of Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia.
The few studies that have been conducted suggest notable differences between East Africa and more prominent vulture-using regions such as Southern and West Africa. These include differences in traditional, spiritual, and medicinal practices associated with Muti, West African Vodun, and East African witchcraft. Cultural taboos also differ between these regions. For example, some groups within Kenya believe vultures to be unclean and ugly, while others associate them with death and view them as bad omens. Such perceptions may result in limited use and market demand for vulture species.
West Africa.
Belief use of vultures and other animals is a common occurrence in West Africa where practitioners of Vodun have been known to promote the consumption of vulture parts at their markets for decades. Most vultures that are killed for traditional belief use are deliberately poisoned. Carcasses of other animals are laced with poison, which the vultures then feed on, so that many vultures and other raptors can be killed and harvested with a single poisoned carcass. There are vast differences in the prevalence of vulture belief use between the various countries and populations in West Africa, due to cultural differences and different political regulations and policies. In some markets, the trade of animal parts for fetish practices have been completely banned, while in others there is a flourishing market and high demand for vultures. Specifically, vulture consumption and belief use is associated with Vodun in West Africa. In this traditional belief system, all birds are believed to help against weaknesses in the body. Large vultures are believed to help against mental illnesses and disturbances, epileptic health concerns, and to cure bad eyesight. The Hooded Vulture is traditionally buried in the ground before the construction of a new house, because it is believed to bring good luck. At fetish markets, vultures are the most valuable birds, but their populations have severely decreased and so they are becoming very rare in most markets. However, in Nigeria, the numbers of vultures at fetish markets have doubled since early surveys were taken. The Palm-Nut vulture is highly valued, and their market price is competitive. The high pressure to hunt these increasingly rare birds is pushing their population towards extinction.
Ghana.
In Ghana, several vultures, but mainly the larger Ruppell's Vulture, are seen as spiritual agents. In a study measuring the reactions of people towards the vultures, it was shown that due to traditions and cultural teachings, females and the elderly had stronger beliefs and values concerning vultures. Due to British colonial rule, the use of animal parts in fetish traditional practices has declined greatly in Ghana, and vulture parts are, for the most part, unavailable. Some Yoruba women traders from Nigeria may bring bird parts to fetish markets, which were hunted in Nigeria and brought by these traders.
Nigeria.
A survey of vulture parts in markets throughout West Africa showed that the vulture trade is most prevalent in Nigeria. Within the Southeast region of Nigeria, there is a group called; Ogoni People. The Ogoni tolerate vultures due to them being a symbol of their ancestors. Due their respect for it, the Ogoni do not attempt to hurt or kill the bird. If one comes across a deceased vulture, they will bury it in similar fashion to the way they bury people. A 1992 study found Nigerian farmers use the Hooded vulture in traditional medicinal practices. A survey of the fetish markets in Nigeria showed that the numbers of vultures had actually doubled overall, compared to earlier surveys. The trading of vultures in Nigeria is mostly handled by Yoruba women. There is an increasing pressure on hunters to obtain vultures, as their population decreases and their value rises.
Central Africa.
Vultures are used for physical, mental diseases, bring good fortune, improve success in gambling and betting in business ventures. Sorcery and witchcraft are the top use, and this use stems from Nigeria. The most common way to kill the vultures for traditional medicine is poisoning them through a blowgun. It is the “silent, cheap, easy to obtain and use, and effective.” The common poison used in Lindane and it most commonly used in Cameroon.
Wildlife-based medicinal products are sold commercially in an urban, traditional market. The trade in vultures in markets have contributed considerably to the decline of the vultures and other raptors. Approximately half of the vultures sold are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List as a threatened or endangered species. [4] “In the past four years, approximately 1000 beheaded poisoned vultures have been found in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Cameroon, and Tanzania.
There was not a lot of readily available information about the beliefs and traditions in Central Africa, regarding vultures. The information found supported the idea that hooded vultures are the prominent vulture in the area. The use due to the demand being high, black kites head feathers are plucked as a substitute for the hooded vultures. There are several instances in Central Africa were dealers are selling vulture heads for traditional medicine. Vulture head was sold in Maroua, in Garoua 10-12 vultures heads were sold, another set of legs and a head sold in the market.
Other Causes for African Vulture Population Declines.
Although vulture trade and consumption is a large threat to vultures, it is not the largest. A whopping 61% of vultures are killed by poisonings, intentional or unintentional. This is compounded by another 9% dying from being electrocuted by exposed wiring. In comparison, 29% were killed for use in traditional medicine, and 1% for food. The main reason vulture poisonings are so prevalent is a by product of another broader problem endemic to Africa, poaching. Vultures are notorious scavengers and this hurts them doubly in this scenario. With a sharp increase in rhino and elephant poaching over the last few years poachers have been poisoning the carcasses to kill any circling vultures which might reveal their position to the local authorities. Additionally many pastoralists in Africa poison carcasses to kill marauding lions, hyenas, and wild dogs. These poisoning incidents can kill upwards of 40 vultures per carcass as well as a plethora of other nearby animals.

Harry Earnshaw (trade unionist)

Harry Earnshaw (25 March 1891 – 2 April 1977) was a British trade union leader who served as Chair of the Labour Party.
Earnshaw was born in Blackburn to Haworth and Alexandra Earnshaw, who worked in the cotton mills. He became active in the Amalgamated Association of Beamers, Twisters and Drawers (Hand and Machine), a small cotton industry trade union based in Lancashire, and was elected as its general secretary in 1940. As its only full-time employee, he acted as its first point of contact, as well as leading the union and representing it on external bodies.
The Beamers were affiliated to the United Textile Factory Workers' Association (UTFWA), and Earnshaw served on its executive for many years. Raymond Streat considered him to be one of the more militant members of the executive, tending to side with Archie Robertson against the more moderate approach of Alfred Roberts.
Earnshaw achieved greatest prominence through his connection with the Labour Party. From 1942 until 1962, he served on the party's National Executive Committee, as the nominee of the UTFWA, and in 1951 he was elected as Chair of the Labour Party. "The Observer" described him as "serious and diffident, sometimes wrong but always quite selfless, quiet, friendly and charitable... an impressive symbol of all the simple, decent people who believe in the party's mission". In 1947, Earnshaw travelled to Rome with Denis Healey to represent the Labour Party at the annual congress of the Italian Socialist Party. While there, they visited Pope Pius XII. Healey recorded that the Pope reminded told Earnshaw that "you must recognise that you carry a great responsibility", to which Earnshaw responded "aye, Pope, and so do you".
In 1951, Earnshaw was appointed as the General Secretary of the General Federation of Trade Unions, to take up the role the following year, when his sting as Chair of the Labour Party ended. However, he was unable to find affordable accommodation in London, and so withdrew before taking up the post.
Earnshaw was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1953 Coronation Honours.

In January and February 2015 the band supported American rock band Chiodos during their Australian tour. In March the sixtet supported In Hearts Wake before touring Australia as headlining act for the first time.
Vocalist Daniel Breen announced his departure through letters directly to the bands closest fans in early 2016. This marked a new musical direction for the band as the band moved away from their previous metalcore/post-hardcore sound. The band later announced their follow-up record "Sin Will Find You" which was set for release on 5 August of the same year. The album peaked at no. 30 in the Australian Albums charts. The band supported Pierce the Veil on their Australian run of their world tour in promotion of their fourth record "Misadventures" along with an Australian headliner tour

Harsh vocalist Daniel Breen formed new project called Steadfast.
Musical style.
Storm the Sky's music is describable as atmospheric metalcore, while the guitars are described as progressive. On their second album the band combined their natural metalcore style with influences from Death rock and Pop music which led the atmospheric sound to be more in foreground. The dark-sounding synthesizer has been compared to U2, while the dynamics in their songs can be compared to hardcore act letlive.

Jean Salvanh

Jean Salvanh (between 1515 and 1520 in Rodez – after 1580) was a 16th-century French architect.
Biography.
Upon the death of his father, Antoine Salvanh, he succeeded him as master builder of the cathedral. An act dated 24 October 1554, drawn up by Antoine Fournier, notary in Rodez, gives him this title.
The bishop of Rodez was then Georges d'Armagnac. , was the bishop's secretary and was appointed canon of the cathedral on 27 March 1554. It is probably Guillaume Philandrier, trained in Italy and translator of Vitruvius who completed his education by introducing him to new architectural ideas.
In 1560-1561 he was one of the consuls of Rodez and was described as the "mestre de l'obra de la cathédrale".
In 1561, the bishop of Rodez charged him with the rebuilding of the château de Gages in the Renaissance style to make it his summer residence. He had received it in 1545 as usufruct of Marguerite of Navarre and it was falling into ruins.
He built the western gable of the Rodez Cathedral in 1562, probably according to a plan by Guillaume Philandrier. At the same time he undertook to complete the southeast tower of the cathedral, but was unable to carry out this project.
For the Cardinal of Armagnac, he made repairs at the Saint-Amans church, on the bishopric's terrace, at his castle in Muret.
After the completion of the construction of the cathedral of Rodez, he went to work for the city of Rodez as "master of masonry works". He made repairs on the ramparts, at the Saint-Martial gate.

Kazushi Sakuraba vs. Royce Gracie

The mixed martial arts fight between Kazushi Sakuraba and Royce Gracie was held in 2000 at PRIDE Fighting Championships. Due to its special rules, it lasted 90 minutes before ending with the victory of Sakuraba by TKO. It has been widely considered one of the greatest and most influential MMA fights of all time, as well as a vital part of the rivalry between the Gracie family and Sakuraba, who gained the nickname "Gracie Hunter" after the match. It was followed by a rematch in 2007 in K-1 Dynamite!! USA, where Gracie defeated Sakuraba by controversial fashion and tested positive for steroids after the bout.
Background.
The rivalry between Kazushi Sakuraba from Takada Dojo and the Gracie family of Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners started in PRIDE 8, when Sakuraba faced Royler Gracie, though it actually traced back to the first PRIDE Fighting Championships event, PRIDE 1, where Royler's brother Rickson had defeated Sakuraba's stablemaster Nobuhiko Takada. The victory over Takada had served to cement the Gracie family's reputation in Japan and continue the spreading of their family art as it had happened in United States with the Ultimate Fighting Championship venture. However, the match between Sakuraba and Royler changed this opinion. Sakuraba, a professional wrestler of the shoot-style kind (a mixture of catch wrestling, judo, sambo, muay thai and other arts), dominated Royler both standing and on the ground and defeated him by the way of Kimura lock, following up with a challenge to Rickson himself. This loss was the first for the Gracie family in decades (coincidentally, by the same move as the last time they lost to a Japanese fighter in Masahiko Kimura vs. Hélio Gracie), and marked the question whether their approach to mixed martial arts, mainly based on Brazilian jiu-jitsu alone, could still hold up against a well-rounded, cross-trained fighter like Sakuraba. The Gracie side argued Royler's loss should not be counted, as it had happened by referee stoppage, an action that went directly against the special ruleset they had requested for that fight. In order to clear this out and issue a challenge, undefeated UFC champion and Royler's and Rickson's brother Royce agreed to sign up with PRIDE, which had previously been in contact with him for an abandoned matchup with Mark Kerr.
Upon the annunciation of the PRIDE Grand Prix openweight tournament in 2000, it was known both Royce and Sakuraba were going to partake, so a match between the two was anticipated. This matchup eventually realized after the first round of the tournament on January 30, as they both eliminated their respective opponents: Gracie defeated Nobuhiko Takada by decision, while Sakuraba defeated Guy Mezger after a retirement due to contract issues. With this resolution, they were slated to fight each other. However, seeking to prevent a situation like the Royler match, the Gracie side demanded special rules for the match. Their representative Rorion Gracie called for an unlimited number of 15 minute rounds, no judges, no referee stoppages, and only knockout, submission or towel throw as ways to win. Sakuraba found these demands inappropriate, while Royce defended himself by underlining the role of his family in the history of MMA and by pointing out he was already at a weight disadvantage in the match (actually just 7 lbs). Mark Kerr, who competed at the same tournament, supported Sakuraba's criticism on the personalized rules. Eventually, Sakuraba accepted, and characteristically joked about wearing a diaper to the match in prevision of its unlimited length, as well as learning ventriloquism to deceive the referee into believing Gracie had submitted. However, upon finding Royce absent from the rule meeting the day before the match, he engaged in a brief trash talking, criticizing the Gracie family and accusing them of hypocrisy and cowardice.
Sakuraba would reveal that, although Gracie's cornermen later reacted at these declarations, Royce himself took no offense and wished them both for a good fight.
The fight.
The match took place at the Tokyo Dome in front of an audience of 38,429 people. While Gracie made his entrance performing the famous "Gracie train" with his relatives and teammates, including Rorion and Hélio Gracie, Sakuraba came wearing a Super Strong Machine wrestling mask and accompanied by Daijiro Matsui and Minoru Toyonaga in identical attires and masks, making impossible to tell which of them was the Japanese fighter until he unmasked in the ring. At that moment, Sakuraba revealed his hair dyed bright orange, which was part of a bet he had made with a Japanese TV comedian. Unlike Royce, who chose to wear a full Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi for the fight, the Japanese wore his orange wrestling tights. Professional wrestler Antonio Inoki and musician Eric Clapton came to the ring to present them with flower bouquets.
Sakuraba opened the fight scoring a single leg takedown right after the opening bell. When Gracie returned to his feet, they clinched and went against the ropes. Unable to properly hit Sakuraba, Gracie pulled guard and attempted to seize his opponent's leg for a leglock, but Sakuraba escaped by turning his back. The Brazilian then got up and clamped to his back, only for Sakuraba to grab a Kimura lock from behind and drop down to try to complete the hold. The fight moved to the corner, where Gracie tried to free himself from the hold by raining hammerfists on Sakuraba's back and head, while the latter held position and stuck his head outside the ropes to counterbalance himself. Knowing the strikes lacked power to inflict damage, Sakuraba spent the time looking directly to a cameraman outside the ring and smiling to him, which drew cheers and laughs from the crowd. Referee Yuji Shimada separated them and restarted the fight, but the situation repeated itself, with Kazushi pursuing submissions from behind and Royce keeping himself active with short strikes. At the last seconds, the wrestler locked a kneebar that seemed decisive, but Royce managed to resist until the round time went out.
At the second round, the contenders clinched again against the ropes, where Gracie threw knee strikes to Kazushi's bandaged knee. A discussion happened at the four minutes mark, as Gracie refused to let the referee restart the fight. Still on the ropes, Sakuraba gripped the Brazilian's sleeve to hinder his strikes, and when Gracie tried to free it, the wrestler capitalized on the distraction to undo Gracie's obi, allowing him to grab more freely his uwagi. In response, Royce tried to drop down to guard, but Kazushi was able to pull him up back to standing. Finally finding an opening, the Brazilian scored several punches, but Sakuraba's control on his jacket shut his offense off, at one point even pulling the cloth over Royce's shoulders to confuse him while trying to cover his head with it. Gracie attempted now a standing guillotine choke, which Sakuraba countered with a takedown to half guard. Another tumult broke up when Royce hit an accidental knee to the groin, although not by the blow itself, which went unnoticed, but by their reactions; Royce apologized to Sakuraba, and the latter signaled his understanding by patting him reassuringly in the rear, making the Gracie corner believe he had tapped out. In any case, the choke was ultimately ineffective, with Sakuraba even toying with Royce's pants while trying to grab his belt. Again, the time ran off again without a conclusion.
The third round began with the already usual clinch against the ropes. After the Brazilian scored several punches, Sakuraba accidentally hit him with his own low blow, leading the referee to warn him. Once Gracie was given some minutes to recover, he tried a sweep, but the Japanese reversed it with a takedown and dropped him to his guard. As Sakuraba wasn't engaging him on the ground, Gracie got up and rammed him to the corner, where he looked to score foot stomps and knees, but the Japanese suddenly attacked with a flurry of right punches that knocked Gracie to the mat. Taken by surprise, the Brazilian initially opted to remain on the mat to stay safe, although he returned to his feet when Sakuraba started kicking his legs as he had done in the fight against Royler. As soon as the Brazilian fighter got up, Sakuraba landed a heavy low kick that made Gracie falter noticeably. During the next minutes, Royce attempted to reestablish the clinch, only for the now openly offensive Sakuraba to land both punching combinations and low kicks in every attempt. Shortly after, Sakuraba added theatrical Mongolian chops to his offense, using them to set up strikes and confuse his opponent. Royce eventually accomplished the clinch, but just a few seconds before the end of the round.
Finally acknowledging he was facing unexpected difficulties, Gracie decided to focus completely on the match instead of looking up to continue on the tournament. He started the fourth round aggressively, but Sakuraba grabbed his uwagi and dragged it around to nullify Gracie's offense. The Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert dropped down to his guard in an attempt to avoid the new tactic, which Sakuraba capitalized on to control him further by grabbing his gi trousers. This forced Gracie to stand up and keep himself mobile to avoid more grabs, but at the same time allowed Sakuraba to score more punching combinations and low kicks, clearly seeking to accumulate damage on Gracie's legs. Already limping and with a cut on his eye, Royce returned to his previous offensive strategy and tried his best to take Sakuraba down, but although he managed to capture Sakuraba's back, the shoot wrestler blocked all his takedown attempts. The round ended with Sakuraba on Gracie's half guard.
Sakuraba opened the fifth round with a low kick and a takedown, showing no signs of fatigue yet in stark contrast to his clearly worn down opponent. He besieged Royce's closed guard and landed ground and pound in the form of punches and Mongolian chops, which forced Gracie to open his legs. At that moment, the Japanese grabbed the Brazilian's trousers and dumped him over his head, capitalizing on the confusion to score several punches to the face. Gracie answered with a few strikes from the bottom and avoided a guard pass by establishing a butterfly guard, but Sakuraba stood up and scored a clean stomp on Gracie's face before the time expired.
At the opening of the sixth round, Sakuraba took Gracie down and attacked his guard again. This time, Gracie hit a few heel kicks to the back of Sakuraba's head, pursuing an Ezequiel choke from the bottom that was unsuccessful. With both fighters standing again, Sakuraba landed repeated low kicks, punishing his opponent's legs even when the latter dropped to the mat in an attempt to avoid it. Gracie was able to slow the pace standing by ramming Sakuraba against a corner, but by this point the Brazilian was too exhausted and worn to follow up with a takedown attempt or a try to capture his back. A new low kick by the shoot wrestler sent Gracie to the mat, where Sakuraba rained strikes and punches through his guard. Sensing the final of the bout was approaching, Gracie tried takedowns and guard pulls in a last attempt, only for Sakuraba to block all of them and keep punishing his legs with kicks. The Japanese then jumped high over the jiu-jitsu expert's guard and landed a heavy flying punch just before the end of the time. During the rest, Royce sat on his corner stool and informed his teammates he was unable to walk because the damage to his legs (one of his femurs would be found to be fractured due to the accumulated kicks), and after some deliberation, finally Rorion Gracie threw the towel to concede the fight. Sakuraba was declared the winner after 90 minutes of fighting.
Despite the effort of such a fight, Sakuraba chose to advance round and continue fighting through the card, which put in a match minutes later against Igor Vovchanchyn. The Japanese performed dominantly enough to be granted an extra round, but the effects of his previous battle showed up and he decided to bow out of the tournament, being eliminated.
Reception.
The match was not only met with appraisal, but also called one of the greatest matches in MMA history. Only in 2000, Dave Meltzer from "Wrestling Observer Newsletter" gave it the MMA Match of the Year award, while years later, Stephen Quadros put it as the receiver of "the biggest ovation he witnessed in his entire career", the first of many "pivotal events in mixed martial arts", and "the greatest fight in PRIDE Fighting Championships". These consideration have been echoed through the years, with Brain Knapp of "Sherdog" calling the fight "its historical significance off the charts", Mike Sloan from the same website placing it as the second top mixed martial arts bout ever, Pedro Olavarria from "Fightland" comparing it to the "Fight of the Century" between Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali, and Jonathan Snowden stating in "SB Nation" that it "changed MMA history forever". In his book "UFC's Ultimate Warriors: The Top 10", mixed martial arts insider Jeremy Wall commented: "No fight in MMA history, before or since, has come close to that length and still remained an exciting bout."
The fight, along with his performance the rest of the year, gained Sakuraba "Wrestling Observer Newsletter"´s 2000 Best Shootfighter and "Tokyo Sports"'s Most Valuable Player awards, and cemented his rising status as PRIDE's main Japanese player. Also, even although defeated, Gracie also experienced a surge in popularity due to his own performance and will to fight through the many rounds. However, attention was put in the symbolic passing of the torch between Gracie, the original mixed martial arts icon and popularizer of groundfighting, and Sakuraba, the new generation fighter and emissary of a well-rounded fighting game. In his article "Sakuraba and NHB Fighting" for "Black Belt" in October 2000, Steven Keckan pondered: "Ten years ago, the no-holds-barred was still on its infancy in the United States and "jujutsu" stylists dominated the fighting circuit. [...] Now Sakuraba is turning the tables on the jujutsu fighters." He also concluded: "Other fighters should study this man carefully. We have seen the future of NHB fighting, and its name is Sakuraba."
Reception within the Gracie family was positive too. Renzo Gracie, second cousin to Royce, praised Sakuraba's spirit, fighting skill and entertaining ability during the fight, and stated he would fight him in the future. Royce and Rorion themselves appreciated his opponent's intelligence, and the former stated his belief Sakuraba would have won the entire tournament had not met him on the bracket. Royce also claimed he was willing to rematch him under different special rules, an idea supported by then PRIDE executive Naoto Morishita. However, this rematch didn't materialize, so Sakuraba fought Renzo instead in August at PRIDE 10. While there was expectation towards a possible match between Sakuraba and Rickson Gracie, whom the Japanese fighter had originally challenged after his bout with Royler, Morishita considered it improbable due to Rickson's own demands.
Rematch.
In May 2007, seven years after their fight, it was announced a rematch between Sakuraba and Gracie as part of the Dynamite!! USA event in June co-produced between K-1 and EliteXC. The announcement met a mixed reception, as while Gracie had fought only 4 bouts in the hiatus, Sakuraba had added a number of 21 fights to his record and was considered to be in significantly deficient health due to their toll. It was even questioned whether he could pass the medical tests mandated by the California State Athletic Commission, especially after he fainted during training months earlier and was diagnosed with vertebrobasilar damage, though he eventually passed them without trouble. Gracie, while acknowledged as in much better shape, was confident in that the Japanese fighter could fight him. The Brazilian fighter had cross-trained in muay thai for his previous fight against Matt Hughes at UFC 60, while the Japanese had polished his own skills in said art in the Chute Boxe camp after his bouts against CB member Wanderlei Silva.
The fight.
Royce made his entrance to the event wearing his trademark gi, but this time he took it off in order to fight in MMA shorts. Sakuraba followed shortly after, wearing a Chute Boxe jersey and a series of wrestling masks that he went peeling off theatrically while walking the ramp.
Sakuraba opened this fight by immediately knocking Royce down with a low kick and a right hand. Choosing to remain on the mat, the Brazilian defended with vigorous punches and upkicks when Sakuraba threatened with an ankle lock, so the Japanese resorted to kick his legs in trademark fashion, an exchange that drew boos from the crowd. When the Japanese fighter finally acceded to engage Gracie on the ground, he passed his guard with some punches and captured his back on the side, forcing Royce to stand up. After some struggle, in a reminiscence of their first match, Sakuraba grabbed a Kimura lock attempt and caused them to go between the ropes while Gracie struck him in an attempt to get free. The round ended with both exchanging kicks again.
At the next round, Sakuraba blocked a takedown attempt and tried to attack, but Royce charged with a clinch against the ropes. Advised of the wrestler's long time injury, Gracie focused his efforts in landing knees at Sakuraba's bandaged knee. The action slowed down while they fought at the clinch, which attracted again the crowd's disapproval, and it was only interrupted when referee Mario Yamasaki restart. Retaking the action, Sakuraba stopped another takedown and landed several knees from a classic muay thai clinch. In response, Royce moved them against the ropes, where they exchanged body shots and knees until the end of the round. Both fighters acknowledged the other's effort and hugged in the rest time.
At the third and final round, the Japanese scored a takedown. When Royce answered with a Kimura lock attempt from his guard, Sakuraba capitalized on it to pass his guard and catch his back. Gracie stood up, but Sakuraba threatened him again with his own Kimura attempt, so the Brazilian threw strikes at his head, although the wrestler managed to block most of them with his glove and shoulder. With 40 seconds remaining, Gracie shot for two takedowns, but Sakuraba blocked them, captured his back again and started to work for an armbar while Gracie defended. However, the time expired with the Japanese still pursuing the submission.
After the match, judges Richard Bertrand, Nelson Hamilton and Cecil Peoples scored the contest as 30-27, 29-28, and 29-28, all three for Gracie, who was thus declared winner by unanimous decision. Sakuraba and him hugged again and were greeted on the ring by Hélio Gracie.
Reception.
In marked contrast to their first bout, the match's reception was negative. Not only the fight was considered "lackluster" or even "embarrassing" by a number of reviewers, the very decision of the judges to award Gracie the victory instead of Sakuraba garnered a heated controversy. In its official play-by-play of the match, MMA website Sherdog actually scored the bout two rounds to one in favor of Sakuraba, a score agreed upon by a majority of fans polled, and deemed him the victor over Gracie. Even Jake Rossen's later review from the same website, while criticizing both men's performances and ultimately considering the match a draw, disagreed with Gracie being given all the three rounds. The sentiment was summed by MMA Oddsbreaker by stating: "no one but Royce can say with much confidence that he beat Sakuraba that night".
On 14 June, the CSAC revealed Gracie had tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone, a performance enhancing drug banned in all professional sports, in his pre and postfight drug tests. While Nandrolone occurs naturally in the human body in amounts between 2 ng/mL and 6 ng/mL, both of Gracie's samples provided a level of over 50 ng/mL, ruling out the possibility of a false positive. He was suspended for 12 months after the date of the match and fined with $2,500, the maximum penalty allowable in California. Gracie pleaded ignorance and claimed he had not increased any mass for the match, but this was contradicted by observation and an official "ESPN" article about their official weights. Unlike most MMA promotions in American ground, Dynamite!! could not legally overturn the result of the match due to an infraction, so Royce's victory was kept in his record. Nevertheless, the revelation impacted even more negatively on the sport's perception of the Brazilian fighter and his achievement, eventually becoming one of the top steroid scandals in MMA history. Carlos Matallanas from "El Confidencial" wrote: "what may have been the definitive redemption of the Gracies turned out another taint, this time indelible, in the honor of their family".

Propionispira raffinosivorans

Propionispira raffinosivorans is a motile, obligate anaerobic, gram-negative bacteria. It was originally isolated from spoiled beer and believed to have some causative effect in beer spoilage. Since then, it has been taxonomically reclassified and proven to play a role in anaerobic beer spoilage, because of its production of acids, such as acetic and propionic acid, during fermentation
Isolation and original classification as Zymophilus.
"Propionispira rafinnosivorans" was first isolated as "Zymophilus raffinosivorans" in January 1990 by Schleifer et al., spoiled beer and pitching yeast were examined to characterize enigmatic bacterial species and their ecological significance in beer spoilage. Once collected, microbes were inoculated into a modified medium which consisted of peptone, yeast extract, meat extract, glucose, NaCl, hydrated MgSO4, MnSO4, a solution of KH2PO4, cysteine hydrochloride, and resazurin. 47 separate strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were observed and recorded. A new genus, "Zymophilus", was identified and separated into two distinct species, "Zymophilus paucivorans" and "Zymophilus raffinosivorans," "Zymophilus rafinosivorans" was originally identified as being the type species.
Reclassificiation and methods utilized.
More recently, Ueki et al. 2014 reevaluated the species Z". raffinosivorans" and "Propionispira arboris," by comparing them to a new strain of Negativicutes, WK011T, as well as the original type species, "Zymophilus paucivorans". Strain WK011T was isolated from residue of rice straw, which had been digested by cows and was being broken down in a methanogenic reactor, which is a bioreactor used to break down organic waste matter into methane. The anaerobic roll-tube technique was utilized in isolation of anaerobic bacteria by inoculating them into anoxygenic agar tubes. The media in the tubes was Peptone Yeast Agar containing trypticase, yeast extract, Na2CO3, L-cysteine hydrochloride dihydrate and sodium resazurin. Strain WK011T was then sequenced and found to have a 95% genome similarity to both Z". raffinosivorans" and "Propionispira arboris". Based on this evidence, both species were combined into the species "Propionispira raffinosivorans" comb nov. The other member of its genus, "Zymophilus paucivorans," was incorporated into the genus "Propionispira" as "Propionispira paucivorans" comb nov. The following type strains, or bacterial strains which exemplify the characteristics defining a genus and species, have been identified in "Propionispira raffinosivorans": OW8, OW9, 0W10/1, and OWQ10/2. Strain WK011T was proposed as a new species of the genus Propionispira", Propionispira arcuata sp. nov." 
Etiology of Genus and species name.
The genus name, Propionispira, can be divided into two parts: Propioni-, coming from the Latin word Propionicum, meaning Propionic acid former, and spira, coming from the Latin word -spira, meaning coil. Raffinosi- comes from the Latin word, Raffinosum, meaning raffinose and -vorans comes from the Latin word, vorare, meaning to eat or devour. This organism's full name identifies its coil-like morphology and ability to utilize raffinose as a carbon source to produce propionic acid.
Closely related species.
The closest relatives are "Selenomonas lactifex, Pectinatus frisingensis, Propionispira arboris", "Pectinatus cerevisiiphilus," "Propionispira arcuata sp. nov," and "Propionispira paucivorans comb. nov", which can all be found in the class Negativicutes. This relation is based on genomic similarity as well as the ability of these organisms to stain gram-negative, even though they are found in the Gram-positive phylum of Firmicutes. The main identifying characteristic which differentiates "Propionispira sp." from other Negativicutes"," is the presence of the cross-linked , meso-diaminopimelic acid, which is covalently bonded to α-carboxyl group of D-configuration glutamic acid within peptidoglycan cell walls. This covalent bond causes the a-carboxyl group of glutamic acid to be replaced by cadaverine, which is an indicator of "Propionispira sp.," the presence of lipopolysaccharide in the outer membrane, specifically lipid F, is indicative of "Propionispira sp". as well.
Morphology.
"Propionispira raffinosivorans" is a motile, non-spore forming, Gram-negative bacterium. Although, repeated subculturing has been able to cause a loss of motility in this organism. Its cell shape is a curved, helical rod which can be found alone, paired, or in groups. Cell size can range from a length of 1.0–2.3 µm and a width of 0.3–0.5 µm. When plated on MRS agar, or De Man; Rogosa; and Sharpe agar, "P. paucivorans" produces smooth and circular colonies, which contain a yellow tint and range from 1-2mm in diameter.
Metabolism and physiology.
"P. raffinosivorans" is classified as an obligate anaerobic chemoorganotroph, but its specific electron acceptors and donors have remained elusive. "P. raffinosivorans" can ferment glucose, cellobiose, maltose, fructose, mannitol, mannose, ribose, sucrose, and arabinose to produce acid. It produces propionic acid, carbon dioxide, and acetic acid as products of its fermentative metabolic pathway. It does not produce acid when fermenting amygdalin, glycogen, erythritol, dulcitol, inositol, inulin, starch, melezitose, melibiose, trehalose, raffinose, and xylose. The KEGG database shows that "P. raffinosivorans" has genes encoding for oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and carbon fixation, allowing it to use a variety of substrates for energy. P. raffinosivorans has an optimum growth temperature of 30°C and is able to survive concentrations of ethanol around or below 5%"." Also, it can grow at pH levels at or greater than 4.3 The ecological significance of this organism has only been researched in the context of beer spoilage and its appearance has been noted in a bioreactor containing cow feces, pitching yeast, and anaerobic beer packaging.
Genome.
The genome of "P. raffinosivorans" DSM 20765 is the only strain of this species to be completely sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 technology by the DOE's Joint Genome Institute on April 24, 2013, allowing quantification of genome length at 4.13 Megabp. The Whole Genome Shotgun Sequencing method aided in sequence identification, developed by Staden et al. 1979, in which DNA was fragmented randomly and amplified to produce overlap between short sequences of DNA, which were then used in primary assembly. Primary genome assembly, known as scaffold level assembly, provided a rough map of DNA sequence orientation and location, but is still incomplete with a total gap of 2,843 bps in the DNA that have yet to be correctly inserted and oriented for chromosomal reconstruction. Assembly of the genome was attempted using the windows program Velvet 1.1.04, created by Zerbino et al. 2008, in conjunction with the program ALLPATHS v. R37654, providing an accurate reconstruction of 99.9994% of the draft genome. The genome G-C content was identified to be 38.1% and the assembled genome was shown to code for 3,772 proteins, with the 30S ribosomal protein S2 being used as a non-redundant protein reference for taxonomic placement.
Ecology.
The habitat range of "P. raffinosivorans" is yet unknown but has been predicted to be fairly ubiquitous in breweries with species identifications in Germany, the Czech Republic, Scandinavia, and Japan. Both "P. raffinosivorans" and "P. paucivorans" strains are known to have a habitat connected exclusively to breweries. Strains of "P. raffinosivorans" have been identified from brewing related sources including pitching yeast, spoiled beer, and brewery wastes. 10 strains were identified in pitching yeast and 4 strains in brewery waste by Schleifer et al. in 1990 using 16SrRNA sequencing via reverse transcriptase, a Biosearch Cyclone DNA synthesizer to design primers complementary to conserved 16SrRNA sequences, and terminal transferase. DNA hybridization, via conserved sequences targeted by DNA probes, was then used in conjunction with 16SrRNA sequencing to determine evolutionary distances between 47 organisms isolated from the same sources and to create an unrooted phylogenetic tree.
Hops have been shown to have antimicrobial effects, due to Iso-alpha acids, against gram-positive organisms, which are resisted by pseudo-gram-positive organisms like those in the class Negativicutes, such as "P. raffinosivorans." The effects of hops and the production of acids by "P. raffinosivorans," as well as increasing ethanol concentrations due to fermentation by yeast, contribute to decreased competition by fastidious bacterial species, in the volatile environment of packaged beer. These same acids, produced by "P. raffinosivorans," which decrease the pH of packaged beer and limit competition, also cause the off-flavour and spoilage of beer.
Importance.
"Propionispira raffinosivorans" has been considered a potential spoiler of beer since it was first isolated, but it was not until 2008 that evidence for this theory was apparent. The advancement of beer bottling techniques, aimed at decreasing the oxygen content of beer to prevent spoilage, was shown to correlate with an increase in obligate anaerobic bacterial contamination. This technology was specifically aimed at reducing "Lactobacillus sp.," which account for nearly 70% of beer spoilage, but had unintended effects because it increased the prevalence of anaerobic spoilage bacteria in beer. "P. raffinosivorans" produces acetic acid as one of its major by-products of fermentation, which can increase the flavor of beer to a certain degree but will quickly produce inimical effects at higher concentrations"." This shows that "P. raffinosivorans can" produce enough acid to spoil beer, even though few fermentable sugars are available in packaged beer, which has created interest in further study of its metabolic pathways. Because of these reasons, the brewing industry has shown an increased interest in the factors that prevent the growth of beer spoilage organisms, to increase the shelf life of their products and minimize financial losses.

Gandharan Buddhism

Gandhāran Buddhism refers to the Buddhist culture of ancient Gandhāra which was a major center of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent from the 3rd century BCE to approximately 1200 CE. Ancient Gandhāra corresponds to modern day north Pakistan, mainly the Peshawar valley and Potohar plateau as well as Afghanistan's Jalalabad. The region has yielded the Gandhāran Buddhist texts written in Gāndhārī Prakrit the oldest Buddhist manuscripts yet discovered (1st century CE). Gandhāra was also home to a unique Buddhist artistic and architectural culture which blended elements from Indian, Hellenistic, Roman and Parthian art. Buddhist Gandhāra was also influential as the gateway through which Buddhism spread to Central Asia and China. 
Overview.
In the view of Buddhist sources, Gandhāra was one of the so-called great regions ("mahjanapada") of ancient India (a geographical concept that included many other parts of modern South Asia). Under the Mauryan empire (ca. 300–185 BCE), its capital was the city of Taxila. The center of ancient Gandhāra was the Peshawar basin in northwestern Pakistan which extends westward into Afghanistan along the Kabul River. This region exerted cultural and linguistic influence on what has been called "Greater Gandhāra" which encompasses the surrounding areas eastwards across the Indus River (such as Taxila), north towards the Swat Valley and Upper Indus, west towards Bamiyan and across the Hindu Kush into Bactria and the Oxus river valley. 
The Indian emperor Ashoka (ca. 268–233 BCE) erected edicts in the region, some of which use the Gāndhārī language and the Kharosthi script later used by Gandhāran Buddhists. These edicts confirm the existence of Buddhism in Gandhāra during his reign. Kharosthi inscriptions have been found as far West as Wardak along the Kabul river, Uzbekistan (Termez) and Tajikistan (Anzhina-Tepe) and as far south as Mohenjo-Daro and Baluchistan. 
According to Xuanzang, there were six great stupas founded by Ashoka in Gandhāra, the largest of which is the Dharmarajika Stupa at Taxila. The archaeological and epigraphic evidence points to the first monasteries and stupas dating from the end of the third century BCE. The Indo-Greek Kingdoms later controlled the area, and some of their kings, such as Menander I (ca. 155–130), were seen as promoters of Buddhism in Buddhist sources. The Greek artistic culture strongly influenced the art of Gandhāran Buddhism, which saw the first representations of anthropomorphic Buddhas, with Greco-Buddhist art styles that can be seen in the drapery and hair style. Successive conquerors of the region included the Indo-Scythians and the Indo-Parthians.
The Kushan empire (30–375 CE) also patronized the Buddhist religion of Gandhāra, supporting monasteries and stupa building. It is not until the 1st and 2nd centuries CE that a significant number of Buddhist centers were founded in Gandhāra. A typical Buddhist center included monasteries adjacent to a central stupa containing relics of the Buddha, which was the central focus of lay and monastic veneration and donations in the forms of sculptural images. Under Kanishka the Great (128–151), Buddhist stupas and monasteries were built in the Gandhāran city of Peshawar (Skt. "Purusapura"), the capital of the Kushan empire. The name of Huvishka, Kanishka's successor, was attached to a large monastic complex at Mathura. During this time, sculptures and narrative reliefs were used to embellish Buddhist structures, focusing on the life of Gautama Buddha. The archaeological record shows a dramatic increase in the patronage of Buddhist sites sometime in the 3rd century, with many more images and shrines being added during this period. Most of the extant architecture dates from this period and includes sites such as Taxila and the large monastic institutions like Takht-i-Bahi, Sahri-Bahlol, Jamal Garhi, Ranigat, and Thareli.
The Kushan support of Buddhism and their establishment of secure trade routes from Gandhāra to Asia allowed Buddhism to continue its spread to Bactria, Central Asia and China along the Silk Road. The cult of the Bodhisattva Maitreya was particularly strong during the Kushan empire, as shown by the abundance of Maitreya images found in Gandhāra. Other major sites from the Kushan period include the Butkara Stupa and Barikot.
Karosthi inscriptions indicate the existence of the following Buddhist schools in Gandhāra; the Kasyapiya, the Dharmaguptaka, the Sarvastivada and the Mahasamghika. Richard Salomon has attributed most of the Gandhāran texts to the Dharmaguptaka school who were a major Buddhist school in the region. During the Chinese pilgrim Faxian's visit to the region, he reported that most monks where practicing non-Mahayana forms of Buddhism. However there is also plenty of textual and artistic evidence for the existence of Mahayana in Gandhāra.
After the fall of the Kushanas, small kingdoms ruled the area, most friendly to Buddhism who continued to promote Buddhist stupas and monasteries. Buddhism began to weaken in the region after the second half of the fifth century when the Hephthalite White Huns invaded Gandhāra. After the collapse of Hephthalite rule in the 6th century, Buddhist sites show considerable decline. When the Chinese monk Xuanzang (602–664) visited Taxila and Gandhara, many monasteries were deserted. However, Buddhism continued to thrive in areas outside the Gandhāran core of Peshawar, like in the Swat Valley, Kashmir, and Afghanistan.
Afghanistan's Bamiyan was one of the main cities of Buddhist activity in the region as shown by the remains of the monumental Buddha sculptures known as the Buddhas of Bamiyan. They are believed to have been carved sometime between the 3rd to 6th centuries CE. Bamiyan seems to have continued to be a strong Buddhist site in the 7th century. The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang visited the site in 630 CE, and described Bamiyan as a Buddhist center with "scores of monasteries, and thousands of monks who study the Lokottaravāda".
Another important Gandhāran site in which Buddhism remained strong during the 7th century was the northern city of Gilgit, a key city on the Silk Road which was visited by Chinese pilgrims to study Buddhism. The region was ruled by the Patola Shahi dynasty of the Kingdom of Gilgit in the 600s and 700s, which were adherents of Vajrayana Buddhism. The city later came under the rule of the Tibetan empire until the late 800s.
The religion started its decline after being invaded by the Hephthalites (a.k.a. White Huns) around the middle of the fifth century. They were then replaced by the Hindu Shahis who followed Hinduism although Buddhism continued to flourish.
Xuanzang (602 – 664) passed through Gandhara and found numerous functioning monasteries. He was followed by Ou K'ong who visited in 753 AD. A Buddhist monk was present in Baramulla in 13th century.
The Muslim invasions of India caused further damage to the Buddhist culture in Gandhāra, and Buddhism eventually ceased to exist from the region by approximately 1200 CE due to various factors.
Art and architecture.
Because the region was at a cultural crossroads, the art of the Gandhāran Buddhists was a fusion of Greco-Roman, Iranian and Indian styles. Initially, Buddhist art was aniconic, but Greco-Roman influences led to the emergence of anthropomorphic depictions of the Buddha in the 1st century CE. The height of this artistic style was during the Kushan empire. Many examples of Gandhāran Buddhist sculpture have been found, showing the influence of Greco-Roman sculpture. 
Gandhāran architecture can be divided into four major phases:
Buddhist texts.
The Gandhāran Buddhist texts are the oldest Buddhist manuscripts yet discovered (circa 1st century CE). The material is scattered throughout several collections around the world, and is very fragmentary. Most are in the Gāndhārī language and the Karosthi script, on either birchbark manuscripts or palm leaf. Gandhāran manuscripts have been found for all major Buddhist genres including prose sutras, poetry, Abhidharma, Vinaya, Avadana, Commentaries and Mahāyāna texts. Material which parallels Pali Canon texts has been found, such as the Rhinoceros Sutra ("Gāndhārī": Khargaviṣaṇa-sutra) and a parallel to the Anattalakkhana Sutta.
Mahāyāna Pure Land sūtras were brought from the Gandhāra region to China as early as AD 147, with the work of Kushan monk Lokakṣema who translated important Mahayana sutras like the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra. The earliest of these translations show evidence of having been translated from the Gāndhārī language. The Lokakṣema corpus emphasizes ascetic practices and forest dwelling, and absorption in states of meditative concentration. Some scholars also trace the Mahāyāna "Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra" to the Gandhāra region during the Kushan Empire. 
Influence.
Due to Gandhāra's position on the Silk Road, Gandhāran Buddhism has a strong influence on the Buddhism of Central Asia and East Asia. During the Greek and Kushan eras, the Khyber pass was an important trade route and a key highway connected Peshawar with Bactria (and the city of Balkh, or "Bactra") through the pass. This was the main route through which Buddhism spread to Central Asia and to China. Greater Gandhāra's Buddhist culture thus extended into the cities of Northern Afghanistan (e.g. Kunduz), South Uzbekistan (e.g. Termez), Turkmenistan (e.g. Merv) Tajikistan and south eastern Kyrgyzstan (in the Chui Valley).
Gandhāran missionaries were influential in bringing Buddhist culture to China during the Han-dynasty (202 BCE–220 CE), through contacts at the towns and cities of the Tarim Basin located in modern Xinjiang, such as Khotan and Turpan. The region was briefly ruled by the Kushans under Kanishka, and this allowed Buddhist missionaries easy access to the towns of the Tarim Basin.
Important Buddhist figures from Greater Gandhāra who acted as translators in China include Lokakṣema, An Shigao, Dharmarakṣa (265–313), Zhi Qian (220–252), Jñānagupta (561–592), and Prajñā (c. 810). 
Vajrayana Buddhists from the Greater Gandhāran regions of Gilgit and the Swat Valley (which is possibly the widely cited Oḍḍiyāna) were also influential on the establishment of Tibetan Buddhism. Xuanzang notes during his travels to the region (629-645) that he found many Buddhists which were inclined towards Tantric practices. The presence of Tantric Vajrayana Buddhism in the region during the 7th and 8th centuries has been confirmed by recent archaeological finds which includes rock cut sculptures of Avalokiteshvara, Vajrapani and a Vajrayana siddha figure.

This is the list of important Gandharan monks from modern day's Gandhara region of Pakistan in chronological order;
Founders of various Buddhist schools.
Gandharan Buddhist monks from Afghanistan directly or indirectly developed important schools and traditions of Buddhism like Nyingma school of Tibet, Sautrāntika school of China, Hossō and Kusha-shū schools of Japan, as well as traditions of Dzogchen and Yogachara in East Asia. Gandharans were instrumental in spreading Buddhism to China, Korea and Japan and thus deeply influenced East Asian philosophy, history, and culture. Founders of various buddhist schools and traditions from Gandhara are as follows;

The upgrading of the road involved the conversion of the then existing gravel surface to tarmac and the building of bridges and drainage channels. Energo Project, a Serbian construction company carried out the upgrade, between 2010 and 2011, at a cost of USh13.8 billion (at that time US$6 million), funded by the Government of Uganda.

Verveine du Velay

Verveine du Velay is a range of liqueurs created in Le-Puy-en-Velay by the distillery Pagès Védrenne. Their flavour derives from lemon verbena in a melange of thirty-two plants, spices and aromatic herbs. They are made by macerating these botanicals to form a strongly-flavoured green liquor, and mixing it with distillate which is then aged in oak casks. 
Verveine is normally taken after a meal as a digestif, but can also be used in cocktails. Other verbena-based aperitifs and digestives are available in different regions, but Verveine du Velay Pagès is the best known across France and is distributed internationally.
Origins.
Verbena ("verbena officinalis"), also known as common vervain or wild hyssop, has long been associated with divine and other supernatural forces, and it has an equally long-standing use as a medicinal plant.
Later, it was hung above a bed to ward off charms and spells and used to make love potions.
In the Auvergne, druids were recorded as calling for “virgins crowned with verbena and foliage gathered at the sixth day of the moon, decorated with mystical rings and skilled in the art of preparing potions” to sit alongside them at their major councils.
Development.
The "Verveine du Velay Pagès" we know today was developed by Joseph Rumillet (1833-1916), from Champagneux, Savoie, who started his career in a distillery in Lyon. Rumillet was an apothecary and a herbalist and soon became skilled as a distiller.
Lemon verbena (aloysia citrodora), native to Peru, was introduced in France in 1785, and by the age of 26 Rumillet had developed the concept of a verbena-based liqueur. In Lyon he met his wife, Eulalie Charretier, and in 1859 they moved to his wife's district, the Velay, where he set up a distillery in Espaly-Saint-Marcel. It was here that he perfected the formula for "Verveine du Velay" in two versions, "Verte" and "Jeaune".
His success enabled him in 1865 to set up a distillation plant in Le-Puy-en-Velay which he named "Grande Distillerie du Velay Rumillet-Charretier", adding his wife's surname to his own.
Rumillet subsequently took up politics, first as a town councillor in Le-Puy-en-Velay from 1880 to 1892, and then as a deputy for Haute-Loire from 1885 to 1889.
In 1886, he appointed his cousin Victor Pagès as manager of the distillery and its reputation continued to develop. Joseph Rumillet retired from the business in 1891 to a house in Vals-près-le-Puy which he named, appropriately, "Villa des Verveines". At this point he transferred ownership of the distillery to Victor Pagès, who renamed it "Verveine du Velay Pagès".
The business remained under Pagès family control until 1984, when it was acquired by another well-known family-controlled drinks company, Renaud-Cointreau.
The Pagès liqueurs.
Lemon verbena is cultivated, harvested and dried in the local Velay district of Haute-Loire, partly under the direction of the distillery, and partly by the Carmelite nunnery at Vals-près-Le-Puy. It is planted each year in May, growing to about a metre high and harvested before the first frost in September.
In addition to lemon verbena, the process uses juniper berries, mace and some thirty other herbs and spices. Certain of these botanicals are soaked in a diluted alcohol solution for several weeks, resulting in a liquid with a deep green colour and strong bouquet. The rest are heated in special bain-marie copper stills with brandy, water and plain alcohol, capturing the aromatics and producing a rich distillate. Honey from the Auvergne, sugar and cognac are then added, creating the different blends:
Five and ten year-old variants complete the range. The product is then aged for a year or more in oak barrels and bottled at the Pagès-Vedrenne site in Nuits-Saint-Georges.
About 150,000 bottles are produced annually. Other than France, it is also popular in the Benelux, Scandinavia, the Far East, and the USA.
Verveine du Velay is also used as an ingredient in soufflés, ice creams, macarons and cakes, as well as to add flavour to certain beers.
The Pagès distillery is recognised by the French State as an ("Living Heritage Company"), having excellence in traditional skills.
Other verbena-based liqueurs.
Other verbena-based liqueurs in France are produced by artisan, family-based concerns, mainly in the Alpes and Massif Central.

Die beste Show der Welt

Die beste Show der Welt ("The best show of the world") is a German television show which was first broadcast on 30 April 2016 on ProSieben. In the program, presenters Joko Winterscheidt and Klaas Heufer-Umlauf present three independent show concepts. After all six shows have been presented, the studio audience decides which show wins the title of the "best show in the world" or the "worst show in the world". Voting devices are used by the spectators. These "remote controls" can also be used for the interactive design of the show. The moderator is Jeannine Michaelsen. In the third and fourth edition, Oliver Kalkofe commented on the events and judged the respective shows.
The program is produced by Florida TV and was awarded the Deutscher Fernsehpreis in 2017.
Show concept.
Joko Winterscheidt and Klaas Heufer-Umlauf present three (up to four four) shows each with a length of about 20 to 30 minutes. The presented shows are partly new show ideas, but are also based on existing TV show formats, which are slightly modified and parodied. At the same time, the two of them may force each other to participate in a show once per appointment ("Joker").
In the first four episodes, the studio audience with voting devices determined the audience for the show shown, which was the TV viewer at home live as a graphic superimposed. This graphic has been removed with episode five on 2 December 2017. Each of the 600 people in the studio could switch on or off during the show, as if sitting at home in front of the TV, using their voting device, which acts like a remote control. Over the entire running time of the show could be switched on or off as often as you like. The course of the ratings was therefore close to how good or bad the show arrived at the studio audience. This was only visible to the television viewer at home, not for the studio audience. Until the second installment of the program, a "cloud of light" consisting of white spheres fixed above the studio and illuminated with lasers was installed in the studio, which had visualized the audience rating by their brightness. The more spectators from the studio audience turned on, the brighter the cloud of light became. Since the third edition, these are no longer available. At the end of a show, their average ratings are calculated and announced. It wins the show, which could reach the highest ratings. Should the audience rate drop below 25% during a show, it will enter a "red area" (colored red on the graphic). This is now also audiovisually signaled in the studio (light turns red and the picture on the video wall in the background falls apart). If the ratings stay below 25% for more than one minute, the show must be cancelled and considered "cancelled". The generated up to that point in the audience is forfeited.
Since the fifth episode no quota is generated during the show. Instead, viewers in the audience at the end of the show choose the show they like best from all six concepts presented. It also "The worst show in the world" is determined.
Joko or Klaas won a trophy for the "Best Show in the World", the German Television Award in an oversized version (referred to in the show as the "German Television Prize in XXL") as a parody of the real German Television Award.

Lucie Coutaz

Lucie Coutaz (9 May 1899 – 16 May 1982) was a French clerical worker who belonged to the French Resistance during the Second World War and afterwards assisted Abbé Pierre in setting up the charity Emmaus.
Early life and career.
She was born in Grenoble, and as a 16-year-old office worker suffered a paralysis caused by Pott disease, from which she recovered after a pilgrimage to Lourdes in 1921. Having completed secretarial training, she became a social worker and a union leader in the French Confederation of Christian Workers. The information office where she worked was used as a cover by the French Resistance. In 1943, she agreed to shelter Henry Grouès (alias Abbé Pierre) from the Gestapo, and this began a relationship that would last for almost forty years. The abbé took refuge in North Africa, but returned after the war to seek her out. He was now almoner of the "Maison du Marin" in Paris and asked her to accompany him there. Although reluctant to leave Grenoble, she agreed. His political activities took up so much of his time that she considered leaving.
Post-war.
She was awarded the Croix de Guerre with bronze star in 1945. After the war, she continued as secretary to the Abbé Pierre, and she became known as “Mother Coutaz” by the people in need who visited his offices. Some colleagues referred to her as "Lucie la Terreur". The abbé himself said that, without Lucie, Emmaus, which was founded in 1949, would never have existed. During France's exceptionally cold winter of 1954, the charity was almost overwhelmed by its task, and the abbé appealed publicly for assistance, while Lucie Coutaz looked after the day-to-day management. As a result, the first Emmaus communities were created.
At the age of 82, she again suffered a paralysis; among her last words were, "Maintenant, mission accomplie." Her book, "40 ans avec l'Abbé Pierre", was published in 1988. She is buried close to the abbé (who died in 2007) in the village of Esteville, his former home.

Jacob Stepanovich Esipov (), (date and place of birth are not known - died 1805, St. Petersburg, Russia), Russian inventor in the field of sugar beet industry. In 1799-1801 he was first to developed a technology for obtaining sugar from beets under industrial conditions in Russia.
Commercialization.
In November 1802, J.S. Esipov built the first beet sugar and alcohol distillery in Russia, in partnership with Yegor Ivanovich Blankennagel in the village of Alyabyevo () of the Chernovsky County () of the Tula Governorate (). During 1802-1803 the factory produced 4.9 tons of raw sugar from beets harvested from 11 tithe of crops (1 tithe = 1.09 ha). The purity of raw sugar was approximately 85%. Waste sugar production (molasses, etc.) was processed into ethyl alcohol. In 1807, the sugar-refining department was added to operation at the plant. For the first time in Russia J.S. Esipov introduced the purification of beet juice with lime. This method is still used at present time.
Fall of 1802 J.S. Esipov built the second, more advanced beet sugar plant with a sugar refining capabilities in the village of Nikolskoe (). In 1803-1804, it produced not only raw sugar, but also white sugar, alcohol, and liquor. The byproduct of manufacturing was used for animal feed. According to calculations by Mr. Esipov, the yield of raw sugar from beet was 3.1% of the beet mass.

Charlie Sivuarapik

Charlie Sivuarapik (Sheeguapik) (1911 – 26 September 1968) was an Inuk sculptor, illustrator and storyteller from Povungnituk in Nunavik, Quebec, Canada who settled in the then newly established village of Puvirnituq in the 1950s where he remained for his life. Due to declining illness, he was unable to hunt to support his family. Sculpting became a way for Sivuarapik to support himself and his family economically until he died of tuberculosis in 1968.
Biography.
Charlie Sivuarapik was born in approximately 1911 in northern Quebec, Canada. When he was about 40, he moved to a village that was being newly settled by the Hudson's Bay Company named Puvirnituq (population: 1692 as of the 2011 census). Sivuarapik was ill with tuberculosis for much of his life, which prevented him from participating in the traditional male role of hunting in his community. In efforts to support his family economically, he turned to stone carving.
Charlie's career was first influenced by James Houston who visited Puvirnituq in 1948 and 1950 to encourage many in the area to begin carving as a means of livelihood. Peter Murdoch, the founder of the Federation des cooperatives du Nouveau-Quebec and the co-manager of the Hudson's Bay Company, and Father Andre Steinmann, patron of the Puvirnituq Sculptors Society, were also early mentors of Sivuarapik's. They taught him how to evaluate and price Inuit artwork by promoting an environment of shared critiques among the artists of the Cooperative, pushing them to strive for better quality carvings.
Sivuarapik studied his own anatomy to obtain a more precise understanding of proportion and shape. He first worked with ivory mainly depicting otters, but transitioned to stone human figures with realistic, expressive facial features captured mid-activity after 1953. His carvings grew in size from small, hand held objects to larger pieces of stone, and he often used secondary materials to distinguish hunting objects, such as knives and spears. By 1955, Charlie's sculpture was more dynamic through the complex use of negative space, and his unique portrayal of mythological scenes in a realistic manner. Charlie was also versed in the European style of printmaking. Sivuarapik's excellence at carving allowed him to found the Carvers Association of Puvirnituq, today the Cooperative Association of Puvirnituq, a part of the Federation of Cooperatives of Northern Quebec.
Sivuarapik's success earned him a feature in "The Beaver" magazine in 1956 written by Peter Murdoch. He was also the subject of Richard Harrington's photo essay published in the 1959 "Canadian Geographical Journal". Charlie accompanied Father Steinmann to Cleveland, New York in 1958 to gain revenue for the Cooperative, successfully returning with $3000 of prepaid orders. While there, he was featured on the Dave Garroway Show. The pair also travelled to Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal, and Pittsburgh. This trip allowed the revenue for the Povirnituq Cooperative Society to increase from 1968 ($250,000) to 1969 (over $500,000).
Sivuarapik's work is greatly admired because of his use of "sulijuk", which is a Nunavamiut term for completeness. Popular Inuit arts academic George Swinton has referred to Sivuarapik as, "the most significant influence in the development of Pov naturalism", based on Swinton's personal experiences with the artist when he travelled north with the Hudson's Bay Company in 1957. Although many of Sivuarapik's works are in museum collections, sculptures for private sale are often available.
His work is held in a variety of museums, including the National Gallery of Canada, the Winnipeg Art Gallery, the Flint Institute of Arts, the Museum of Anthropology at UBC, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the Hood Museum of Art, and the Canadian Museum of History.

Methoxytoluenes (methylanisoles or cresyl methyl ethers) are a group of three isomeric organic compounds with the formula CH3OC6H4CH3. They consist of a disubstituted benzene ring with methoxy group and one methyl group. All three are colorless flammable liquids which are soluble in organic solvents but poorly soluble in water. They are not of major commercial interest although they are precursors to the corresponding methoxybenzoic acids and methoxybenzaldehydes.

Boxing at the 2018 Commonwealth Games – Men's light welterweight

The men's light welterweight boxing competitions at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia took place between 5 and 14 April at Oxenford Studios. Light welterweights were limited to those boxers weighing less than 64 kilograms.
Like all Commonwealth boxing events, the competition was a straight single-elimination tournament. Both semifinal losers were awarded bronze medals, so no boxers competed again after their first loss. Bouts consisted of three rounds of three minutes each, with one-minute breaks between rounds. Beginning this year, the competition was scored using the "must-ten" scoring system.

Hale Tenger

Hale Tenger (born 1960, Izmir) is a visual artist based in Istanbul. She is known for her large-scale installations that explore identity, collective memory, and political violence. Using sculpture, video, and sound, her work has been exhibited at numerous public institutions, including Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC.; Martin-Gropius-Bau and Kunst-Werke, Berlin; Kunstmuseum Bonn, Bonn; Fridericianum, Kassel; New Museum, New York; Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art and Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam; Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille, Lille; Carré d’Art-Nimes Museum of Contemporary Art, Nimes; Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary, Vienna; Seoul Museum of Art, Seoul; Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven; ZKM, Karlsruhe; Centre d’Art Contemporain Genéve, Geneva; Nikolaj Contemporary Art Center, Copenhagen; Museum voor Moderne Kunst Arnhem, Arnhem; Istanbul Modern and ARTER, Istanbul.
Education.
Tenger received an AA in Computer Programming from Bogazici University in Istanbul in 1981. After her undergraduate studies, she enrolled into Istanbul State Academy of Fine Arts where she obtained an MFA in 1986. The same year, she received a British Council Award and enrolled in the South Glamorgan Institute of Higher Education, Cardiff to receive another MFA in 1988. For both of her MFAs, she focused on ceramics. After her education, she started experimenting with bronze casting and welding. Tenger was an artist-in-residence at the New York State College of Ceramics at the Alfred University in 1994. She participated in the residency of Artpace in San Antonio in 1997.
Selected Works.
"The School of Sikimden Aşşa Kasımpaşa (The School of I don’t give a fuck anymore)" (1990) is an installation with a large-scale galvanized iron pool filled with red-dyed liquid, placed underneath a set of Ottoman-era scimitars suspended from the ceiling. The work refers to the 1990 assassination of the academic and women's rights activist Bahriye Üçok, while suggesting a critique of Turkey's neo-Ottomanist tendencies, militarized nationalism, and religious devotion. It was most recently exhibited at "Dream and Reality: Modern and Contemporary Women Artists From Turkey," organized at Istanbul Modern in 2012.
I" "Know People Like This (1992) is a wall installation with small found objects, including figures of god of fertility and Three Monkeys of See No Evil Hear No Evil, which evokes the elements of the Turkish flag. Following the exhibition of the work at the 3rd Istanbul Biennial curated by Vasıf Kortun in 1992, the artist was prosecuted for denigrating the Turkish flag. The defense argued that the artwork did not refer to the Turkish flag, and instead criticized patriarchy and male violence. Tenger acquitted but has not shown the work in Turkey since 1992.
Produced in collaboration with the musician Serdar Ateşer, Decent Deathwatch: Bosnia-Herzegovina (1993) is an installation with 800 water-filled glass jars that feature images and texts about Bosnia, drawn from the international media. Placed on metal shelves, the water-filled jars create a laboratory-like setting that explores isolation and archiving at the same time.
We didn’t go outside; we were always on the outside/We didn’t go inside; we were always on the inside (1995) is an installation work that consists of a wooden hut, a guard booth surrounded by a barbed wire. This is a work she created for the fourth Istanbul Biennial curated by Rene Block in 1995. In the installation, the militaristic environment is juxtaposed with romantic landscape photographs and music coming from the radio placed in the hut, evoking a sense of confinement and isolation. The work offers "a memorial combining privacy with a sense of loss and entrapment." In 2015—twenty years after its first exhibition—, the work was restaged in the basement of a historic building in New York, organized by Protocinema, a nonprofit arts organization based in Istanbul and New York.
"The Closet" (1997) is a three-room installation where the artist recreates a domestic setting against a background of the 1980s Turkey under a military dictatorship. Darkened with thick curtains, a dining room features a radio that narrates a football match and a news broadcast; a bedroom hosts a desk and schoolbooks of the period; and a closet presents a stack of vintage clothing. Suggesting a sense of disappearance, the piece creates the claustrophobic feeling of a particular era ridden by violence and fear. The installation was recreated for the exhibition "How Did We Get Here" (2015) at SALT Galata in Istanbul.
Beirut (2005–07) is a video work showing the facade of the Saint-Georges Hotel in Beirut—an abandoned building that was severely damaged during the civil war in Lebanon. The work depicts the movement of white fabrics floating at the windows, placed for a protest against the delay of renovation permission.
Produced in collaboration with the musician Serdar Ateşer—Tenger's long-term collaborator—, Balloons on the Sea (2011) is a video piece that features balloons floating on the water, ready for a pastime activity of shooting. The work explores the latent violence while suggesting an act of resilience. The work was exhibited at the International Exhibition at the Biennale di Venezia in 2017, curated by Christine Macel.
I Know People Like This III (2013) is an installation that takes the form of a maze, where the walls feature images of mass street protests, police arresting people, devastation, and anger—all printed on x-ray film shown against light-box panels. The display of the archive suggests a look through the insides of a political body with illness.
Commissioned by Alserkal Programming in Dubai, Under (2018) is a public art installation where viewers walk in to a free-standing structure that hosts a tree with a net. The work refers to a traditional hunting trick, using nets to get birds accustomed to fly lower.
Exhibitions.
Tenger had her first solo exhibition at the Galeri Nev Istanbul in 1990. Her solo exhibitions include "Where the Winds Rest," Galeri Nev, Istanbul (2019); "We didn't go outside; we were always on the outside/ We didn’t go inside; we were always on the inside", Protocinema, New York (2015); "Swinging on the Stars", Galeri Nev, Istanbul (2013); "Perspectives: Beirut", Smithsonian Institution, Washington (2011); "Balloons on the Sea", Green Art Gallery, Dubai (2011); "Never Never Land", Mannheimer Kuntsverein, Mannheim (2001); and "The Closet", ArtPace, San Antonio, Texas (1997).
Her work has been featured at international institutions, including Centre Pompidou, Paris; Art Gallery of Western Australia; ARTER, Istanbul; Neuer Berliner Kunsverein, Berlin; Boghossian Foundation, Villa Empain, Brussels; Istanbul Modern, Istanbul; Espace Culturel Louis Vuitton, Paris; Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam; Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary, Vienna; Martin-Gropius-Bau, Berlin; Seoul Museum of Art, Seoul; Palais des Beaux Arts de Lille, Lille; Carré d’Art-Nimes Museum of Contemporary Art, Nimes; Museum voor Moderne Kunst Arnhem, Arnhem; Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven; Protocinema, New York; and New Museum, New York.
She participated in various biennials such as the 57th International Art Exhibition, La Biennale di Venezia (2017); the 1st Haifa Mediterranean Biennial (2010); the 8th Havana Biennial (2003); Gwangju Biennial (2000); 2nd Johannesburg Biennial (1998); Manifesta 1, Rotterdam (1996); São Paulo Biennial (1994); the 3rd and 4th Istanbul Biennial (1992 and 1995).

Mandatory World Tour

The Mandatory World Tour (also known as the Return of the Mandatory World Tour) is the 12th concert tour by American recording artist, "Weird Al" Yankovic. Launched in 2015, the tour supports the singer's 14th studio album, "Mandatory Fun" (2014). Running for two years, the tour played nearly 200 shows in North America, Europe and Australasia.
Background.
Yankovic announced the tour in January 2015 via his Twitter account. The tweet featured a 30-second ad, styled as a propaganda film, calling the show, "the greatest musical spectacle ever seen". The tour predominately played in the United States, with a handful of dates in Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Along with standalone gigs, Yankovic also played music festivals, state and county fairs. At the end of 2015, the tour placed 122nd on Pollstar's annual year end list, earning 8.2 million. In 2016, the singer added additional shows marked as the "Return of the Mandatory World Tour". Yankovic remarked many fans were upset that he didn't play certain territories, stating: "They forgot the show was mandatory". The shows in 2016 placed 159th on Pollstar's annual year end list, making $7.1 million, bringing the total earned to $15.3 million.
Critical reception.
Along with its commercial success, the tour received praise from critics and spectators of the concerts.
In Cary, David Menconi ("The News &amp; Observer") stated Yankovic makes being funny look easy. He says: "People still turn out for Yankovic because he's incredibly skilled at crafting cultural time-capsules starring himself. He's also about the last word in appealing adolescent silliness; my 16-year-old son came along, and he loved it."
Ashley Belanger ("Orlando Weekly") writes Yankovic was a great showman despite the humorous material. For the show in Orlando, she wrote: "'Weird Al' was a live wire. I found my eyes flitting around to follow his every move, like I was a freaking cat watching a laser pointer. Not only did he do costume changes nearly every song, but his whole band played along by switching get-ups too, with enough change-ups to wonder if backstage looked like a teen girl's bedroom with cast-off garments covering every surface."
The show in London received three out of five stars. Brian Logan ("The Guardian") writes: "The experience is more akin to watching a tribute band, where the homage being paid is tongue-in-cheek, if scarcely less affectionate, and the source material extends to every major pop song since the early 80s. Highlights include a swing version of Yankovic's breakout Michael Jackson pastiche Eat It, and his Star Wars/Don McLean mashup The Saga Begins, replete with stormtroopers. Throughout, Yankovic's voice is strong, whether he's aping Kurt Cobain or crooning barbershop with his excellent band. The personal touch is lacking, but there's no denying, Weird Al gives good show."
Cory Garcia ("Houston Press") writes the show was given a different vibe in the Brown Theatre. He says: "The surroundings made the show feel bigger physically and on a metaphorical level. It feels weird to label what Weird Al does live as a concert because it feels much more than that. Over his career, Weird Al Yankovic has earned his place in fancy theater venues; yes, his art may be writing food-centric parodies of pop songs, but he is the Shakespeare of that art. So, maybe I've had it backward before; it's not that Al is worthy of playing the Wortham; it's that the Wortham is worthy of hosting Al."
Danny Gallagher ("Dallas Observer") stated the show at the Winspear Opera House was a repeat success of the show in October 2015. He goes on to say: "The focus of his show is on the music, even if he's performing purely for laughs. It's a tightly constructed and executed set list that not only included multiple instruments and heavy multimedia interaction but also wardrobe changes and even some special prosthetic makeup."
Setlist.
The following setlist was obtained from the concert held on May 15, 2015, at the PH Showroom in Las Vegas, Nevada. It does not represent all concerts for the duration of the tour.

Aubrey Kruger

Aubrey Kruger (21 July 1935 – 19 July 2016) was a South African draughtsman and inventor.
Working life.
He worked as a draughtsman for the South African Railways and Harbours Administration in East London, Eastern Cape, until 1966. He was then transferred to Durban. In 1973 he moved to East London, Eastern Cape and started a tyre retreading company. In his later years he worked as a draughtsman for an architectural company. After that he became a truss designer for a timber company. 
Invention.
Eric Mowbray Merrifield is credited for the invention of the "Dolos", a concrete block used to stop coastal erosion. However, Kruger countered that claim by claiming that he was the inventor of the "Dolos" and that he had done so in 1963 after being instructed by the South African Railways and Harbours Administration to find a solution for the sea eroding the harbour. The block is reinforced in a complex shape weighing between 80 and 88 tonnes. It is used all over the world in harbours 
Personal life.
He married Daphne Margaret Bright (b. 6 May 1937) on 1 February 1958 and they had four children. He died after a stroke in his house in East London, Eastern Cape.

The 1944 United States presidential election in Michigan took place on November 7, 1944, as part of the 1944 United States presidential election. Voters chose 19 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Michigan voted narrowly for Democratic nominee, incumbent Franklin D. Roosevelt over Republican Governor of New York Thomas Dewey, carrying 50.19% of the vote to Dewey's 49.18%. The election was close, with Detroit, Flint and most of the Upper Peninsula going to Roosevelt and most of the rest of the state going to Dewey. Michigan would not vote Democratic again until 1960.
This was the only state Roosevelt flipped from the previous election. Meanwhile, Dewey flipped Ohio, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, which had gone for Roosevelt in 1940.

Hale Freeman Trotter (born 30 May 1931) is a Canadian-American mathematician, known for the Lie–Trotter product formula, the Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm, and the Lang–Trotter conjecture. He was born in Kingston, Ontario.
Trotter studied at Queen's University in Kingston with bachelor's degree in 1952 and master's degree in 1953. He received in 1956 his PhD from Princeton University under William Feller with thesis "Convergence of semigroups of operators". Trotter was from 1956 to 1958 at Princeton University the "Fine Instructor" for mathematics and from 1958 to 1960 an assistant professor at Queen's University. He was from 1962 to 1963 a visiting associate professor, from 1963 to 1969 an associate professor, and from 1969 until his retirement a full professor at Princeton University. From 1962 to 1986 he was an associate director for Princeton University's data center.
Trotter's research deals with, among other topics, probability theory, group theory computations, number theory, and knot theory. In 1963, he solved an open problem in knot theory by proving that there are non-invertible knots. At the time of his proof, all knots with up to 7 crossings were known to be invertible. Trotter described an infinite number of pretzel knots that are not invertible.

It is native to Malaysia and Sumatra. This bottom-dwelling tropical fish is found in mainland Southeast Asia. Its natural habitats are streams and rivers as well as flooded forests during the rainy season. It is often confused with the Crossocheilus oblongus, however, both are algae eaters and will behave similarly.
Description.
The Siamese algae eater has a black horizontal stripe extending from opercle to tail. The stripe can fade to camouflage the Siamese algae eater against its surroundings. Genuine "Crossocheilus siamensis", (incorrect species) without maxillary barbels and with deeply fringed V-shaped upper lip are rarely encountered in the aquarium trade.
The red algae eater is a species that is widely sold as "Siamese algae eater". It has a bright brownish elongate body with a slightly flat belly. It has a prominent brown-black horizontal stripe extending from nose to tail. This fish may grow to measure up to . It possesses small maxillary barbels and an unfringed shallowly arcuate upper lip. Two other similar species are traded as Siamese algae eaters, namely "Crossocheilus atrilimes", a species that prefers Java moss than red algae, and an undescribed species of "Crossocheilus".
Aquarium care.
The hardy red algae eater "Crossocheilus langei" is commonly found in the aquarium trade and is one of the most popular and effective tank algae cleaners. They are active and fast swimmers that will school together if kept in a group, but some individuals may display aggression to their own kind or related fish. In general, the red algae eater can be kept in most community tanks and is reportedly much less aggressive than similar fish such as the Chinese algae eater or the red-tailed black shark.
Because the red algae eater is effective at controlling tank algae, many aquarists like to place them in heavily planted tanks with strong lighting to prevent the growth of algae. Unlike other aquarium algae eater fishes, the red algae eater is valued for its ability to eat red algae (particularly Audouinella). The fish, however, is an opportunistic feeder and will eat pellets and most other food, a tendency that strengthens with age.
The lid of the tank should be properly closed leaving no large hole for the fish to jump out of the tank.
Since they can't stay in mid water, they love driftwood/rocks and some plants that can support their weight to rest on.
Siamese algae eaters will often school together but are also content living solo. When two are kept together, they will often establish their own territory as they mature. They can be a long living fish, with reports of lifespans up to ten years.

What Made America Famous?

"What Made America Famous?" is a song written and performed by Harry Chapin. The song was included on his 1974 album, Verities &amp; Balderdash. It has also been included on numerous posthumous compilation albums. The song inspired Chapin to write the award nominated Broadway musical, "The Night That Made America Famous".
Background.
The song shows a man, his girlfriend, and kids living in a rundown home. Eventually, a house fire starts, and they need rescue. It is continually asked in the song if anybody cares. It ends with the firefighters waiting to respond to "let them sweat a little", and the plumber ends up saving everyone in the home. They spend the night in the plumber's home and realize that heroes are people who you'd never suspect, or ever know.
Inspiration.
The song was inspired when Chapin himself lived in Point Lookout in Long Island during the 1960s. There was a suspicious fire in a low-income residence. Although it is unknown how the actual firefighters responded, he imagined that they responded like in the song.
Chapin also said, ""What Made America Famous", basically comes out of a thing where my wife was saying 'You should write a song about a volunteer fire department and name it "Answering the Call".' Now, I took it to a whole other place, but I'm a believer in recognizing good ideas. My wife happens to be a fantastic poet and I've been very lucky to have her with me."

Harumi Fujita (archaeologist)

Harumi Fujita (, also known as Harumi Fujita Kawabe) is a Japanese researcher of Mexican archaeology, who has specialized in pre-classical period of the northern states of Baja California and Baja California Sur. Her research has shown that fishing cultures had arisen in the area at the end of the Pleistocene period, indicating an occupation from at least 11,000 years ago. In a cave shelf known as the "Babisuri Shelter", radiocarbon dating indicated the area may have been occupied 40,000 years ago.
Early life.
Harumi Fujita was born in Otaru, Hokkaido, Japan and was raised in Sapporo until her fifth birthday. Because her father was a student at the University of Michigan, the family, which included a brother and her parents, moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan for two years, where Fujita began her primary schooling. Returning to Japan, she completed her secondary studies and attended Hokkaido University. After her graduation, Fujita moved to Israel to study Hebrew and met several Mexican students in her classes. Living on a kibbutz, she became interested in archaeology, visiting various sites during her two years in the country. In 1978, she moved to Mexico City and enrolled in archaeology classes at the Escuela Nacional de Antropologia e Historia (ENAH). Completing her course work in 1982, she accompanied Jesus Mora and Baudelina Garcia Uranga to the Baja California Peninsula in northern Mexico to complete her field projects. Writing her thesis on the shellfish gathered by the prehistoric indigenous people on the peninsula, she graduated with a bachelor's degree in archaeology in 1985.
Career.
Working on a waste pile in Baja California Sur, Fujita postulated in 1988, that the settlements along the coast from the remains of sea animals appeared to be transitory.
In 1991, Fujita was designated as a researcher with the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) (National Institute of Anthropology and History) and assigned to Baja California Sur working the cape region. Her initial task was to coordinate a survey of the area and document sites. Between 1994 and 1996, Fujita's survey of the Island as well as nearby Isla Partida were compiled as "El poblamiento de América visto desde la isla Espíritu Santo" (The settlement of America seen from the island Espiritu Santo) and documented 127 coastal sites, which included caves, open-air campsites, shelters, and waste piles, containing artifacts, burials and cave paintings. Dated to indicate habitation between 10,000 and 21,000 years ago, the findings confirmed occupation of the island long before the arrival of Europeans.
In 1996, Fujita identified the Babisuri Shelter site on the Island of Espíritu Santo. In stratum III of the shelter, she discovered artifacts made from shell that were radiocarbon dated to yield dates indicating occupation of the site at 40,000 years ago. The findings were significant, as they indicated that habitation of the Americas may have occurred thousands of years before previously estimated. Eighty-eight different dating tests were performed on the site, confirming five layers of soils and three different occupations by inhabitants for the Archaic period. In 2000, Fujita and Judith F. Porcasi evaluated methods in which early hunters might have exploited dolphins. Lack of remains, has caused many theorists to reject that such hunting occurred in northern Mexico, but Fujita and Porcasi postulated that clacking stones together underwater from the side of a boat, could disrupt the sonar of dolphins. In areas where deep water is found near the shoreline, the technique could be used to beach the animals and allow them to be clubbed or speared, as it was in the North Atlantic and the Pacific Islands.
Fujita discovered artifacts in 2011, which were c-shaped hooks, similar to those found in Ecuador, Australia and along the coast of the Arabian Sea, indicating that as early as 8,000 to 11,000 years ago, indigenous peoples living in Baja California Sur were engaged in fishing. Fourteen of the hooks were definitively dated to the Terminal Pleistocene era, making the among the oldest fishing hooks known to exist and confirming that fishing cultures had emerged in North America before the Early Holocene period. In 2013, Aníbal Lopez Espinoza published an analysis of the cave paintings documented by Fujita, Dave Huddart and Silva. Expanding her research area along the coast covering the area between La Paz and the Sierra de las Cacachilas (west to east) and between El Novillo and Tecolote Beach (south to north), Fujita identified 172 sites with significant archaeological remains. In all, her work in Baja California Sur has identified over 500 places with traces of historical value. In 2014, she located two caves near Tecolote Beach which confirm ancient settlement of the area to around 10,000 years ago in the Early Holocene period. Similarly to earlier sites found on Espíritu Santo, marine resources and shells were frequently used by the inhabitants. Continuing her work on the site, she discovered 61 burial sites, which show funerary characteristics of dual burials for the ancient inhabitants.

Puente Genil FC

Salerm Cosmetics Puente Genil Fútbol Club, commonly referred to as Puente Genil, is a Spanish football team based in Puente Genil, in the autonomous community of Andalusia.
History.
Founded in 1939 as "Genil Racing Club", the club changed its name to "Puente Genil Balompié" in 1941 and subsequently to "CD Pontanés" in 1950. It first reached the national competitions in 1955, playing in Tercera División and achieving immediate promotion after finishing fourth.
During the club's first season in Segunda División, it changed its name to "Puente Genil CF". After suffering immediate relegation, the club also dropped a division in 1960 and folded in 1973.
In 1988 another "Puente Genil CF" was founded, after the merger of "Puente Genil Industrial" (founded in 1974) and "CD Pontanés". The club played three seasons in the fourth category before being dissolved in 1995.
"Puente Genil FC" started to play in the regional leagues in 2000, and in 2010 the club changed its name to "CD AD San Fermín". A partnership with cosmetics industry Salerm Cosmetics followed, and the club's name was changed officially to "CD AD San Fermín Salerm Cosmetics". In 2018 the name was changed to "Salerm Cosmetics Puente Genil FC" mainly due to its previous history.
